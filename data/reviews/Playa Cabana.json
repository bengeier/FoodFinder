{"text":"Great service and awesome food!!! The bar is also really nice, casual and relaxed yet trendy!! I am obsessed with their tacos! They got nice margaritas as well! It's certainly a great hangout for a couples night, or groups of friends! Make sure you reserve in advance. They are usually booked specially in the summer! The upstairs patio will be closed by 11 cuz of the neighbourhood!!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place a number of times, tucked away in a cozy area of Dupont Street. Cozy relaxed and unpretentious looking, we looked forward to trying the spot out. I'll get the bad out of the way first...

Value - I briefly checked the website first and initially thought the prices seemed reasonable, but later realized all the $9 items I saw were on the appetizer menu (which are the first things you see on the site). Based on some of the other reviews here, I would say the prices have gone up, as I saw no $4 nachos. We ordered a small basket of nachos and cup of guacamole for $9. We had a couple of small mixed drinks and two more very small appetizers (literally 8 chips on a plate) for a total bill of $65 (did I mention we didn't order any main course). Now I understand that these prices are not unprecedented in Toronto, but at these prices the portions of everything were about half of what they should have been.

Now for the good...

The Service - We found our server to be attentive in just the right amount and very friendly. The rest of the staff were warm as we entered as well. Great service.

The Food - This was some of the best tasting Mexican food I have had. I only wish the portion sizes were sufficient for the prices charged, as it would have been great to savor these flavors at greater length. Everything was fresh and authentically made. It's the closest to tasting the real Mexico as you'll get in the city.

Ambiance - This place was just what we had hoped for in terms of its cozy appeal. It had a warmth in its style and the little residential area that it is tucked into makes you feel right at home. 

I would have given this four stars easily if there was little more food on my plate for the price paid. In the end I will look at this a place to go on a special occasion only, with those I was to treat to a small sample of really great Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. 
The service was reasonable. 
The restaurant is cramped.
Overall, it's a worth while experience."}
{"text":"Truly a 5* experience. Everything from the quality and taste of the food, to the drinks, to the server's hospitality was just wow. The variety and flavour of sauces was also incredible too. This place is a must go to if you're in Toronto and want some filling Mexican food."}
{"text":"First off ordered the $54 pitcher of margarita, that tasted like a jug of frozen lime aid. Told waiter it was very weak and he was very defensive that it was not. We ordered 3 shots of tequila and dumped them in the pitcher to satisfy us. Waiter would not take off bill and did not speak to anybody about it.....did I mention it tasted like frozen lime aid???? Fish taco was good, chicken and pork tasted exactly the same with store bought BBQ sauce. Overall service, food, bar gets a negative from me. Come over to my house I'll make you better Mexican!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about Playa- great service, ambiance, tasty and unique foods, and reasonable cocktails. The original margs are delicious and only $6. In Toronto, thats almost a steal! Their homemade chips are amazing- and again reasonable priced for $4. I shared the short rib tacos- with a fabulous crunchy outer shell and the burrito with two sauces. Most Mexican places is toronto do nothing unique or different to their menu, but PC added flair to everything. We ended our meal by sharing the dulce de leche cake- amazing. Dont leave without trying it!"}
{"text":"Positive: My salad was a generous portion, and was good though not at all as described. The corn was also delicious, but a total rip off. The service, once seated, was pleasant and fast and dealt with multiple visa/debit/cash with no problem. The decor is pretty ugly, but it's not too noticeable. 

Cons: This was extremely over priced for extremely greasy food.  Everyone else's orders were small and way too oily. 

Terrible experience with the reservations people as well.

There are so many other better Mexican restaurants in Toronto. I just would never bother going back."}
{"text":"Burritos are massive and very yummy.  I also enjoyed the lime margaritas. Fun back patio area but a but loud and tight."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a good Mexican restaurant for quite a while when we turned the corner to see Playa Cabana. We were fortunate enough to be there on the opening weekend and were treated like family. The owner spent time with us explaining his vision and sharing his stories. 

We have been back several times and the chorizo never disappoints! Good service. Fun atmosphere. Tables a little tight but adds to the fun."}
{"text":"Yes, the food IS as good as everyone's been saying. I would definitely eat there again, but I wouldn't recommend the back patio in the winter time - unfortunately this was our only option as the front room was packed."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 overall
Food was good, not as great as I'd been expecting considering the hype.
La Carnita was much better foodwise
Good vibe but we got rushed in an out, they brought the starter and mains at the same time"}
{"text":"This is the place to visit if you love Mexican food- Real Mexican food. Had some yummy short rib tacos and washed them down with plenty of  authentic margaritas. The place does get busy so reservations are a most but worth it. 

Don't expect to linger and relax. The place is busy and food comes out at a rapid pace to get you to eat and get you out for the next guests to enjoy."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the dinner. Guacamole was excellent. Split some fish and chicken tacos and really liked both. The only knock is that there was no beer on tap; bottle selection was good though."}
{"text":"The ambiance was excellent. Our server was polite and knowledgeable. 
We went for lunch and within half an hour, the place was filled up. 

We ordered the white bass ceviche, which was fresh and well done. Our server brought out some salsa on the house, which was a pleasant surprise.

I ordered the mexican cherizos tacos, which came with deep fried tacos. The menu was excellent, except for the greasy nature of the tacos themselves. I tried the carnita on soft tacos, definitely well cooked meat with lots of flavour.

Definitely a nice nook with very good Mexican food and excellent ambiance!"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana is a Mexican restaurant in Toronto open for lunch and dinner near the popular Yorkville area. They have three locations but I frequent original the 111 Dupont location.There are a few really great Mexican restaurants in Toronto but what I love about Playa Cabana is that it isn't a nutritional death sentence. There are quite a few pretty healthy options that are delicious and filling. The food is fresh and well priced. They also have a great tequila selection and delicious homemade chips. The space is small and cosy and in the summer they have a small patio in the back.
The burrito is big enough to share and I would recommend sharing a little bit of everything. Their ceviche is always fresh and bursting with citrus. The brisket tacos are incredible but very heavy. This is a great place for a fun group dinner, boozy brunch or casual dinner. Strongly recommend getting a reservation."}
{"text":"Ate literally one of the best meals of my life at Playa Cabana tonight. I got the ancho-braised crispy beef shortrib tacos...absolutely Fantastic. The rest of our table got the steak burrito, the chicken tinga tacos and another dish that I can't recall but was basically open-faced crispy tortillas with meat, toppings and rice,etc. We also got Mexican pop and a bottle of wine, plus churros for dessert. Total bill was $140 plus tip for 4 people. Service was lovely, and portion sizes enough to have leftovers. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great food! 
Drinks are not good and margarita was way too salty.
Be careful with the bill because:
- They don't tell you that tips is included (18%)
- They guy added item multiple time and had to tell him to fix it few times before he got it right.
- I paid for my bills in cash and he claimed that i didn't and had to look for it again."}
{"text":"This is really quaint mexican joint with amazingly fresh food, one of the best in Toronto. My favorites are the guac to start, then fish tacos, short rib tacos, the corn and a mojito wash it down. The tres leches cake is to die for.

If you have room  I would recommend trying the different catch of the day. If you see Lobster tacos on the specials menu ....ORDER IT!

Make sure you try and make reservations or be prepared to wait some time for a table but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican in Toronto with the coolest ambience. Amazing place for a date or just to kick back with friends. The service is always friendly and fast, and you can check out all the cool old Mexican decorating and paraphernalia while you wait. If you're not there-- right now-- having their fish tacos and a mojito, then where the heck are you?!"}
{"text":"Went with a group and enjoyed everything we ate. 

Order a bucket of beers, have some guac and chips and order all the tacos! Make sure you wrap up with the tres leche cake. 

I've been obsessed with the cake since we were there (which is saying a lot since the rest of the food is great)."}
{"text":"Was a humid evening and we decided to sit on the patio. We were lucky to get the best seats on the patio, without any wait. That's surprising given how small the place is and that we had not made reservations. Each of us got a drink and we decided to try the home made salsa  and guacamole. 

We get our drinks and the apps and are having a good conversation. 5 minutes later, to our terrible luck, it starts pouring. We ask the server if he could move us to a table inside. The place is an converted home, so I'm worried we won't be seated for a while. Meanwhile, couple of my friends barely moved. Yes, the salsa was that good. Spectacular to say the least. 

Our server moved us inside within 5 minutes and we didn't complain. We placed orders and the food took about 15-20 minutes. The server spoke highly of the baja fish tacos, but I was a little disappointed. I think it could have used some more flavor. The chicken tacos were surprisingly better. One of my friends got the huevos rancheros which was an enormous portion and was quite good.

All in all, a great experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with work colleagues. I got the chicken enchiladas with black beans, it was exceptionally good, probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. Service was good, water glass never went empty and answered any questions etc.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any of the cocktails but I've heard good things so will be back in again to see if they live up to the hype."}
{"text":"This place deserves its great food reviews. Their shortrib crispy tacos are about the most flavourful thing I've had in any Mexican restaurant in Toronto (including all those places open in the past couple of years where people like to line up for tacos) - assuming you like the idea of moist, saucy meat, freshly deep-fried shell, oozy cheese and creamy cool crema and guac on the side. I'm not an expert on \"authenticity\", but it's definitely delicious and not watered down for gringos.  They always have a daily ceviche and the fish tacos are great too. It tends to get really busy and may not be a good place to bring squirmy kids, but it's not hard to get a seat for two at off-peak hours. Their nacho chips are also freshly deep fried and crispily addictive."}
{"text":"Plaaaaaaya caaaabana you are so tiny and adorable!

Solid 4! It takes some time to get a rezzy for this place but it was worth it. I went with my hubby and some girlfriends and was surprised at how tiny this place was. It's in a residential area and it's actually a house which I loved. 

We shared a lot of dishes...but let's start with drinks. I had a rum mojito which was awesome (my fav drink after all) and my hubby had the bacon infused bourbon sour which was aaaawesome. He then had a Mexican iced tea which was strong and delicious. 

Food: We started with crab cakes, chorizo, flautas. The crab cakes were amazeeee and the flautas were crispy, creamy, tangy. Just really good. The chorizo was ok. Nothing amazing. 

For mains we basically had burritos which were authentic but not mind blowing. To finish we shared churros  oh yes! I love these babies. Warm, gooey, with a bite. Mmmmm. 

Service was good. We got a lot of attention (it helps that the resto has like 10 tables and there was 3-4 servers) but still very appreciated. It is loud but not so much that you can't socialize. 

Overall, I might go back but there's still so many more places to see!"}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago on a Sunday afternoon. There was a big group of us and we all left very happy and satisfied. 

The staff were great. They took really good care of our big group. Being such a large group, we just asked one of the servers to recommend/order for us. Unfortunately, I forget his name...but he did an awesome job. We had a good variety of items. 

The food was awesome! Lots of flavour. I don't think there was anything we didn't like. Some of the favorites amongst the group included the shrimp bucket, lobster taco, both types of fish taco, and braised short-rib taco. They were all very tasty and served with a healthy portion of meat.

There was one mishap during the meal though...one of the sangrias came with a loooooooong strand of hair :S (It was stuck on the ice cube...) They were very apologetic and a fresh one was made right away. 

Regardless, we had a wonderful experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special. You can find better tacos at seven lives or la carnita. The restaurant is incredibly small and no waiter wanted to clear out table. They walked by many times and disregarded us. It took us ten minutes for us to get the bill and fed up, we eventually had to signal the bartender to give us the bill. Will not return."}
{"text":"After coming here I feel like this restaurant is overrated.  Our group tried a variety of things off the menu and it was all good but not outstanding.  The only dish that stood out was the Poblano Chile Rellenos. This dish was fantastic the flavours were unreal and the cheese was ooey gooey good!  The side of pork and beans were sadly left behind. 
They have two options for the fish tacos and my friend & I both got it battered when they also make it on the grill.  The fish became soggy after eating the first of three tacos. 
The agave margarita was nothing special either.  
The group enjoyed the ceviche, it was fresh and tasty but a bit too much lime for me. 
The guacamole was good but the avocado itself lacked flavour even on our tacos. 
The churros were crispy on the outside and soft & warm on the inside. The tres leche cake was rich and sweet.  It was the first time I've had it so I can't compare it to a homemade one.  My Salvadorian friends mother who I was with actually makes tres leche cake and she obviously likes her homemade cake better. 
I would return to try the other dishes but I don't think this restaurant is something to rave about. 
Oh & our waiter was pushy and kind of rushed us.  We hadn't looked at the menu yet and he asked us if we would like some tortilla chips with SALSA. We of course said yes.  He asked us if we would like it mild, medium or hot and we asked for medium.  We then received GUACAMOLE instead of salsa and we were a bit confused.  After reading the appetizer menu we realized that there are two orders for tortillas chips and one comes with salsa & the other guacamole.  The guacamole is almost double in price than the salsa.  Almost like he did it on purpose since he did say salsa not guacamole.  The Salsa doesn't come in mild, medium or hot only the guacamole does."}
{"text":"The drink menu is obviously heavily influenced by the spirit of Mexico with nearly 60 different Tequilas to peruse. In the interest of me not reliving my Grade 10 Spring Break trip to Cancun, I steered clear of the body shots, and went straight to the cocktail list. PC offers 8 different takes on the Margarita (available by glass or pitcher), and an additional 8 signature cocktails for those who've had too many messy nights with the Mexican liquid gold. There are also about a dozen international wines to choose from, available as 5 oz, 9 oz or bottles, and 5 Mexican beers with special prices for buckets of four bottles.  In our short stay, we sampled the Bacon Infused Bourbon Sour (House Bacon Infused Maker's Mark Bourbon, House Made Simple Syrup, Lime, Egg White, $10) and the Amber Agave Margarita (El Jimador Reposado 100% de Agave, Orange Juice, $8).  Being served in a tall glass, the former didn't deliver as much bright citrus flavour as I normally get in a traditional low-baller Sour, but it was fairly well balanced and enjoyable nonetheless. The Margarita, in contrast, had massive slap-me-in-the-pucker flavour, and I loved every sip.  Definitely, lesson learned. Stick to what Mexico is known for here, folks. Tequila, tequila, tequila.
Like the cocktail line up, PC's food menu is extensive, fairly priced and features all your Mexican staples and favourites (except maybe tamales, which I am always on the look out for).  After bouncing some ideas off our server, we opted to go with:
Guac Fresca with Homemade Chips ($8)-Since we weren't asked how hot we wanted it, I'm not sure what we got, but I can assume it was mild since there wasn't any detectable heat. The guac was well seasoned, though maybe could have used a touch more lime (but I'm an acid freak), while the chips were crispy and light. My main criticism here would just be the ratio of guac to chips was definitely a little skewed. I even tried to be frugal with the dip on my chip, and still we were left with 2/3rds of a basket of chips and a scraped clean bowl sans guac.
Elotes a la Parrilla (Grilled Corn rubbed with Chili Pequin, Lime and Queso Fresca/Anejo, ($10)- I will never turn down fresh corn, especially when it's slathered in crema and sprinkled with cheese.  As simple as it is, this corn just happened to be the highlight of the night. The kiss from the grill left each kernel engorged with sweet juice- a perfect counterpoint to the salty cheese, spicy chili and sour lime I spritzed on top. Now I am wiggling with excitement for a summer of delicious Ontario corn.
Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos ($14)- Biting into one of these deep-fried bad boys, I may have started to question the whole health-slant of the restaurant. But hell, I say put your weight-watchers calculator away and enjoy it. Packed to the brim with juicy tender beef, the rich ancho flavour was nicely balanced out by the freshness of the tomatoes and salty cheese on top. Smear on a little bit of their house guac and woah, you've got a substantial meal right there. My only quibble with regards to the tacos in general is that unlike other taco establishments in the city, they can't be ordered individually, making deciding on just one a near impossible task and ODing on one rich flavour inevitable. 
Toluca Chorizo Burrito (Wrapped with Oaxan Cheese, Rice, Beans, Topped with a Fried Egg, Guac, Pico de Gallo, Crema, Green Tomatillo Sauce and Red Tomato Sauce, $16)- Which leads me to the next dilemma. After soldiering through the short rib, I still had this beast to tame. Note to self: don't get a burrito unless you're with a team of pubescent male teenagers. Unfortunately, I was too full to really appreciate this monster, but the few bites I managed to get in were very tasty and well balanced. It had bright tomatillos, a sweet tomato sauce, spicy chorizo, and it was all topped off with a luscious runny egg. Maybe a little skimpy on the cheese, but really, with a meal this huge, I'm being glutinous and nit-picky here.
Churros with Dulce de Leche- I am a churro freak, and have to say I prefer the typical stick variety to these little fried nuggets of dough, which while certainly tasty, didn't quite have the same crackly sugar exterior you get from the ridges of traditional churros.  Having said that, considering I am also a super cinnamon freak, and these were beyond well spiced, I finished them off in record time. 
So for 2 cocktails, 2 bocaditos (appetizers), a burrito, an order of tacos, a dessert and a cappuccino, the bill came to $100 including tatax and tip. Very fair considering the large amount of consumables that graced our lips (and the burrito doggie bag we happily took home). Overall, I was quite pleased with our experience at PC and am looking forward to seeing how it holds up against Rick Bayless' Topolobambo when I visit Chicago this month."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wasn't really impressed*. Got the ceviche and the subtle flavors and texture of fish was totally overwhelmed by spicy salsa flavors. Fish tacos were okay but there was something weirdly McDonalds about them... I tasted thousand island Mac sauce and the batter reminded me of filet o fish! The braised beef enchilada was the highlight. 

I will say, despite the food, we enjoyed our meal here. Service was great and it has a nice busy local restaurant ambiance. I'd come back for apps and drinks!

* I say all of this as someone who isn't a huge fan of Mexican food. All I know is I like El Trompo in Kensington more!"}
{"text":"what does this gringo order at what I've heard is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city?

a hamburger...actually a hamburguesa ..... chipotle, wagyu beef with fresh cut fries....

I should state (again) i know a thing or two about burgers...and this was fantastic....fresh, cooked to perfection and damn tasty ....

can't wait to go back and try the 'real mexican food' 

i  heard from my friend that seating is very limited which it is however i was there at lunch and didn't have a problem getting a table on the patio



PS....any restaurant/bar that has Don Julio 1942 on the shelf is a must visit for me"}
{"text":"Great experience - ceviche and tacos are fantastic, as are white/red sangrias and caesars. Can't wait to go back! Nice patio, and good service too."}
{"text":"Small tight place but the food makes it up for it, where the fish taco was AMAZINGLY and their homemade chips with salsa."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday for dinner with a friend. Loved the fresh salsa with cilantro & a basket of corn chips. I had a grilled fish taco & my friend had a crispy taco with chicken loaded with fresh salsa & guacamole washed it down with a glass of wine each.  

Ambience was amazing.  Tiny place but very efficient. Would talk my family there soon"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana is the best Mexican food in Toronto. Everything made from scratch and so fresh, full of flavour. They are great with substitutions and allergies. Quite a few original dishes on the menu like the grilled octopus taco which is a must try. Homemade hot sauces on the table as well. Corn tortillas are made in house. Great ambiance, makes you feel like you're in Mexico. They have many kinds of Mexican tequilas and the best margaritas in the city. Very small restaurant though, going for lunch or during off hours is the best time to avoid lines."}
{"text":"By Far the BEST Mexican I have had in Toronto. 

Went last night with a group of friends, you will need to call for a reservation well in advance, We called for a reservation 3 weeks earlier, we were a group of 6 and wanted the back patio, very cute area and best place in the restaurant to sit.

The server was great, attentive when we needed him to be but we were left alone when we wanted to be, The drinks were fantastic, the Margarita was amazing and the mojito was delicious, and the great thing is they use agave nectar to sweeten all their drinks and not sugar so you aren't left feeling gross and bloated.

We started with the shrimp bucket, which was so tasty, the ceviche amazing and corn..... I still can't get the corn out of my head it was so good! My favourite item of the evening. for mains I had the fish taco's which were seasoned to perfection.

The only thing that was less then impressive was the churro we had for dessert, a bit over fried and too crispy.

Overall a great experience, fantastic food and service, I would highly recommend playa cabana and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Friday evening.  Starters  were blah, ceviche and guacamole.  For the catch of the day, ceviche had a strong fish flavour.  Tacos were good but not as good as Seven Lives at Kensington Market.  Milk cake, amazingly moist and delicious, my favourite.  After our meal, host rudely asked how the food was and asked us to leave because we were holding their table and need it for other patrons!  Extremely tacky! Really! It's a warm Friday night on the patio.  They should open earlier or informed us when we arrived that there is a time limit."}
{"text":"On a work trip from Florida, I heard about this place, at my hotel bar, from a local named Bryan.  I can't thank him enough. 

This place was small, jam-packed with people, and full of staff hustling order after order.  This is always a good sign. 

The food was excellent.  The fish tacos are a must try.  They also have a full bar offering a variety of tequilas.  

Highly recommend this place for authentic, gourmet-style, Southern California Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!  The location is gorgeous, especially the patio in the summer. The food and margaritas are delicious!  The staff is friendly and engaging.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My favourite Mexican in the city and a great spot in the summer for a patio dinner. It's a small space but it's definitely worth the wait. The portions of the tacos are giant, I always end up taking leftovers home (but also because I can't get enough of the guacamole)."}
{"text":"The food was awesome--I had the beef tacos, just the right amount of food for one person.  They give you the option to add rice or a salad (but don't mention it's an extra couple of bucks--luckily, my dining companion thought to ask!), but it's not necessary at all.  The patio is lovely, and even though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated right away.  If we'd arrived later though, I'm sure we would have had to wait--by the time we left, around eight, there was a lineup on the sidewalk.

The waiter was super chatty and did a great job upselling us on dessert--we opted to share a plate of churros, which were delicious."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's best restaurants. I have spent a lot of time in Mexico and the food at Playa Cabana is on point for authenticity. Do not listen to the bad review. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried a number of dishes on the menu and each item has been better then the last. In the summer they have an avocado and tomatillo gazpacho that's out of this world. The only thing that may be a drawback for some people is that the place is small and loud - not a problem for us at all. Make reservations and be on time! This place is super busy. Check out more food reviews at www.thetomatosnob.com"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It has tons of energy and best of all, the food is heavenly. The tacos are super-yummy."}
{"text":"Nice little place for lunch or dinner. Great guac and tacos, although the space is a bit tight and it's hard to get a table. If it weren't so busy I'd be back more often. Service at the bar was a great experience for dinner."}
{"text":"We frequent this location as well as Hacienda quite frequently and have always had exceptional food. The chips and salsa/guacamole are great starters, as is the ceviche (super fresh!). The tacos are delicious and perfectly sized, and the drinks are always great. It's a pretty tight spot so expect to be seated very close to your neighbors! We had one experience here with incredibly sub-par service, but every other time the servers have been attentive and helpful. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place was a reco from a friend after my girlfriend and I mentioned to her that I'd been out of town for a while and was looking for something different. When I first heard where in the city it was, I couldn't picture anything except houses. Needless to say, I was right but this place is an amazing little gem (in a house). 

We were a party of 2 but couldn't get a table so we seated at the bar. No biggie. Being seated at the bar has it's perks. We were able to chat with the bartender while he did his magic. 

We had the ceviche, tacos de pescado (fish), and poblano chile rellenos. The seafood in both of our dishes was incredible. It tasted extremely fresh both raw and cooked. The dishes weren't small either. We could have easily gotten full just on the mains alone. But I like to think my stomach has a 6th gear so I pushed for the ceviche up front. 

The layout of the restaurant is pretty cozy so indoor seating is limited. Reservations are highly recommended as I can see this place bursting at the seams in the summer (even with their front yard patio). 

Overall, a great spot for excellent Mexican. It's definitely on my \"I know a little place in the Annex...\" list."}
{"text":"I've eaten Mexican food in San Diego and las Cruses, New Mexico, and I felt like I was back there right after the first bite!!!, it was Saucesome!!!

Old as well but you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Had a prettttty delicious shrimp burrito, with the kind of hot sauce you just want to drink. Everything was quite yummy, however it felt expensive for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. If there was a negative star, I'd rate it that. They should not accept walk ins at all and clearly state for reservations only rather than practice ambiguity. 

We walked in, was told it could be an hour wait and the reservation girl took our name and phone number. We then walked back to the end of the line and by the time we were the last ones standing (30 mins wait) everyone in front of us were seated and no one else behind us, the same reservation person looked at us with \"who are you?\" look. She shoo'd us away after waiting in line for so long and told us the reservations basically filled up the night. Why did you take our name in the first place? Unbelievable.

Skip this restaurant, its not worth the wait, the parking fee and the nasty service from poorly managed reservation. Just head on over to El Trompo for both excellent service and authentic Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The tacos are sooo good. Fresh ingredients; very authentic-tasting. Burritos are huge. Prices are reasonable for the portions & food quality! Guacamole + homemade chips are also delicious. The place can get a bit crammed, but a cool vibe overall. Would definitely recommend! Also, excellent service!!"}
{"text":"So so busy.  Seriously.  Really, really busy.  But great and completely worth the wait.  Some of the best Mexican food I've found in the city so far."}
{"text":"Absolutely great service, server was very patient when explaining the sauces on the table! Tacos were super yummy, will be back"}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food, I was super excited to eat here but we had to walk out! I booked a table for 2 one month in advance for my birthday. We arrived 10 mins early for the reservation and the host took a while to figure out where we would be sitting, even though there were 3 tables of 2 sitting empty. she finally came back and said we would have to sit at the bar. I said no thanks since I made a reservation I would like a table. She left again only to return and say \"someone should have told you, you would be sitting at the bar\" I informed her that I booked online through their website and no where did it specify that I had to choose between a table or the cramped bar. She said she would \"see what she could do\". The \"bar\" was 5 seats squashed together with 2 people already taking up half of the space and the counter was covered with bartender stuff and a cash register. She finally said we could sit at the bar for drinks and appetizers and MAYBE if someone didn't show up for their reservation we might be able to get a table. WHAT ABOUT MY RESERVATION? we reluctantly agreed but when we couldn't pull the chairs out because it was so small and cramped at the bar we just walked out. In hindsight I wish I had talked to the manager. I was so disappointed my birthday dinner had been ruined as I was so exited to try the much hyped food! Still not sure why they wouldn't honour my reservation, they must have over-booked and I was the unlucky schmuck that got bumped."}
{"text":"Fun ambience 
Great food! We enjoyed the tacos de pulpo (octopus tacos) and the tacos de pescado particularly ! The red sangria is so fresh and tasty!!!"}
{"text":"We got takeout from this place a while back. Overall, I quite enjoyed the food. It would be a 5 star place if their prices where maybe 20-25% lower. We ordered the following items:

- ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS
This was pretty tasty but very messy to eat. Sauce and grease everywhere. I would order it again.

- POLLO MILANESA CHIPOTLE BURRITO
This was really good. Better than the tacos IMO."}
{"text":"We were a group of 6 and I'm so glad we made reservations.  Didn't have to wait for a table like some mentioned. The place was packed and quite small! Not a good idea to hang a huge winter coat on ur chair! We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. .it was good and strong, and not sweet. .kind of perfect! (The one we ordered was called Dave's). For food, we started with chips and guacamole  (delicious but not spicey considered we ordered spicey), chicken quesedillas (probably not my favourite), flautas with braised beef (omg yum!), and corn. Then we ordered tacos - chicken tinga, braised beef, and Baja fish..all were delicious!  We ordered a couple of burritos which weren't bad. I think we preferred the tacos. Finished the meal with churros..which tasted like heaven!  Overall - really good and we'd probable go again but not in a big group. Service was pretty good - very informal. It's a completely different ambience compared to a steakhouse for example so level of service will be different too. I'm normally quite picky on service and I was happy!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Cute concept! Friendly staff with passion for tequila! Portions are huge so worth sharing! Very flavourful and authentic"}
{"text":"This was the best Mexican i've had to date. The atmosphere was good and the staff was very friendly and timely. We were hungry earlier so there was only one table seated on our arrival but come 5pm the place started filling up quickly. Each dish was well constructed with clean bright flavour and was well presented.  My boyfriend and i split 3 dishes, Mar Y Tierra was there surf and turf burrito loaded with big juicy chunks of rib-eye steak and prawns was very good. I would have to say there tacos stole the show thou we had the Tacos de Pescado this was there fish taco that day was snapper and we choose to have it grilled, this was my favorite of the night, the filling was big pieces of the grilled fish tossed with corn and some kind of creamy sauce that was amazing along with guac and onions in a soft shell, the other was Tacos de Chori-Queso a chorizo and cheese taco, this comes out in a crispy shell on a bed of lettuce was very good as well thou quite greasy. We also had Margaritas which were perfectly exacuted"}
{"text":"We had been craving Mexican food for what seems like forever and I can honestly say I was so incredibly impressed with Playa Cabana!
Started out with the chips & salsa and the Tacos de Pulpo (Octopus Taco) and the flavours were out of this world! The Octopus Taco was packed with so much flavour and meat I wanted more instantly!

For the meal, I decided on the Ancho Braised short Rib Tacos and yum yum yum. I think I was full after the first one but couldn't put them down!

All in all I can definitely say we'll be returning here. The service was fantastic for a very busy sunday evening, the food was delicious, and the overall ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. 

I came here on a Friday night with reservations for two (Tip: make reservations! I tried to come once before this without one and the wait was insane). It has a casual, relaxing and fun vibe to it. The washed-out wooden accents give the place that beach house feel that the restaurant is named after. We had the best seat right at the front of the restaurant with open windows looking out to the street. Awesome.

They really do appreciate food presentation here. Near the back half of the restaurant they had all the seafood sitting on ice! Lobster, crab, oysters. This ice tray of deliciousness was positioned near the guy that likely prepares it and some other dishes. It made me want to order the seafood, so good on them.

I ordered a margarita made with Tromba tequila. Very tasty. It was the perfect balance of sweet, sour and tequila. And you could actually taste the tequila. 

We shared the guac and chips. Their chips are so good! Fresh and crunchy like they should be. For my main I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Baja style). Also excellent. If you're getting an appetizer to share I would recommend getting these tacos without the beans and rice. They were very filling on their own. They had this light but creamy coleslaw mix on top of the battered fish which was a nice contrast to the deep-fried-ness of the fish. 

Including ours, all the meals I saw served around us looked very fresh and well presented. The food has definitely lived up to the hype, in presentation and taste.

Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and made good recommendations. The only downside to the evening was the time it took for our appetizer and food to be served: longer than normal. I also wish their sipping tequila wasn't $14 minimum an ounce, I passed on it this time. It's expensive because it's excellent quality, so I understand. The cheaper tequilas were ones you shoot and they had a huge selection. I will have to explore their tequila menu more next time I'm here!

All in all, excellent food, fun vibe, good service, but a long wait on the food. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"good place, decent food.  It's probably the best in Toronto but still pales in comparison to the Southern US or Latin America.  The Mole sauce is excellent however.  The margarita menu was huge but I would have liked to see a spicy margarita offered.  Most mexican places i've been to in the US have a chili infused tequila they can use to spice up the drinks.  I would have given this 4 stars but our meals came before our appetizers so we had to cancel the apps.  Our waiter was great and professional about it and took care of our dessert for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Went for the white sangria and wasn't disappointed .   The Chicken burrito was fabulous and very filllibg great atmosphere too"}
{"text":"Amazing burritos drenched in sauce, great friendly service, and cheap drinks! Will definitely return to try other food on the menu. I also love how their patio has the option to be under an umbrella in case of rain... Which almost happened when I was there."}
{"text":"No Chimichangas here.

Nice restaurant in an offbeat location on Dupont. Easy to get to if you get off at St George subway and just walk straight up Bedford for 5 minutes to Dupont. Its basically right there. Small little place which gets larger with the amazing patio on the outside. We started out on the patio but unfortunately the rain took us inside to a very hip locale with bar seating in the middle of the restaurant. Not sure what it was but there was lots of groups of young women at the restaurant this night.  

Service was quick and had waters to our table super quick. Unfortunately two of the three waters had remnents of left over food items in them. Getting past this the night only got better. The food was fantastic. 

We started with the Guacamole/chips. Loved the baked tortillia chips. The Guac was tasty also.

I ordered a burrito which was beyond huge. Filled with chicken, rice, black beans and all sorts of other goodness was super tasty and super rich. Desert? After you just served that oversized piece of goodness? Don't think so. Overall a super spot and fairly reasonablly priced food. Drinks were slighly pricey but where aren't they these days.

I definately recommend.

Josh"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service leaves something to be desired. 

None of the beer and wine on the menu were available and when asked why the server said \"sorry, we are kind of just a tequila place.\" So why offer beer and wine at all? 

While the tacos were lovely - we sampled all (chicken, chorizo, short rib, fish) the service was some of the most obnoxious we've encountered in Toronto. 

Will not return and unless you don't mind paying for bad service I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, you're still pretty damn good.

The patio is a lovely hideaway. The guac was very fresh, but not nearly spicy enough for \"medium\" (it barely tasted mild), and could use a splash of lime or some red onion.

The chicken burrito was gorgeously presented with both tomato salsa, salsa verde, guac, and a bbq sauce, with a moist chicken interior. A very large portion and quite delectable.

The service was friendly but mostly inattentive. Prices are still just a tad high.

But this is a great spot overall! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We went there for our second anniversary. Place is cozy. Food is delish! For dessert we had the chocolate jar cake. It was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"To make a Seinfeld reference, anyone can take a reservation but actually holding the reservation is the most important part!!!

Last night, my girlfriends and I had made reservations to celebrate a friend's birthday at Playa Cabana. We got there on time at 9pm and were told we would be seated \"in a minute\". Close to half an hour later, the surly indifferent dead-eyed waitress advised us that they were overbooked but we could try to get accommodated at their sister restaurant Hacienda. I have to say I eat out regularly and I have never seen a reservation not get honoured. Why take reservations at all if you can't keep them? And, your solution is to ask us to take a 10 minute walk in our 6 inch heels to your sister restaurant? When I asked her about the inconvenience, she sent over her smarmy manager, who didn't take ownership of the situation. Instead, he blamed OpenTable. Either staff & management are completely incompetent or they are just plain inconsiderate to their customers. I've worked in restaurants through university, how do you not notice beforehand that you are overbooked. They should have called us earlier or they should have advised us as soon as we got there to give us the chance to make alternative arrangements, especially on a late Friday night. No restaurant's food is that good that it could possibly make up for a lack of customer service or basic consideration. Zero star."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! I have only been there once so far but intend on returning since everything about this restaurant was great. 

The food was very flavorful- im not an expert on Mexican cuisine however, the combinations seemed to work every well and everything I ate that night was delicious! 

Take the time to make reservations and come visit ..... it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"This cute beach shack tucked away in a quaint Dupont/ Davenport neighbourhood peaked my curiosity.  I have driven by it a few times and it always looked busy so it was definitely on my hit list to try.  It was a Saturday night on one of our snow falls in Toronto.  It was awful outdoor weather for both driving and walking as people forget how to drive in snow and the flakes are blowing everywhere so it's hard to look up.  I finally stumble into the intimacy of Playa Cabana only to find a very busy and bustling restaurant with all tables full, a line up of folks crowding in the small entranceway and a waiting list that only has openings in about an hour and a half. 
We luckily get seated only after waiting 15 minutes!
We start with the house made guacamole which is delicious and freshly prepared.  It is reminiscent of my favourite guac in the city from Chimichangas (now closed) and the owner may know a thing or two as Dave was the former co-owner there. 
I also want to try the cerviche which is pickerel.  It comes packed with a good kick and is a big appetizer meant for sharing!
The vegetarian burrito and it was a humungous portion but so delicious, my friend was able to polish it without issue.  I ordered the baja fish tacos which came grilled 
They are one of the best fish tacos I've had and I ate at another trendy mexican resto earlier that week so it's a bold statement!  For more heat - we were given 2 house made hot sauces:  the habanero salsa- WOAH - this gives you a big kick of heat but it creeps up on you.   The other one was the roasted chile arboles salsa - which gives you some good heat and is just right for me.
Hasta luego!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican food in Toronto. I have been several times over the last 6 months and recommend the following dishes: chips and guacamole, short rib tacos, chorizo burrito, or the enchiladas. All of these items are top notch. 

The servers are also very knowledgeable on tequila and the bartenders make great custom drinks and sangria. 

You do not want to miss this place. Worth the wait if you do not have a reservation."}
{"text":"Finished a tour at Casa Loma and wanted a good lunch, so we walked 15 mins here. Ordered the Dave's Margaritas and shrimp bucket to start- both were fabulous. Ordered tacos for lunch and everything we had was amazing. Loved the fish tacos and the pollo al carbon tacos especially. Definitely recommend, 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"I will say this about the restaurant. It far and away has some of the best mexican in all of Toronto (not as good as Grand Electric though).

The reason I am giving this place a one star is because it also has some of the worst service/management in Toronto. 

I have tried going to this place twice now. The first was for a birthday party. Our group made a reservation for 12 people two weeks in advance. On the night of the party, we showed up and they only had spots for 4 people, and we had to wait over 1 hour before they crammed 12 of us into a spot for 8 people. I wondered why they would even take a reservation for such a large group if they knew they could not honour.

Despite this long wait, I decided to return again for dinner. I made a reservation for 2 for 8:30 on a Saturday night two days in advance. When we showed up, there was no hostess at the front, and I had to approach the bar and ask when we would be seated. For the next 30 minutes, I was given various responses from the waiters and staff saying \"I have no clue when a table will be ready for you\". The owner then came up to me and I asked him what is the point of taking reservations if they can never honour them. I told the owner I would post this fact on Yelp, at which point he yelled at me to \"F*** Off\". The hostess apologized to me for this, and within 5 minutes we were seated. Once seated the owner continue to mouth off to me from the kitchen for threatening to post a bad review on yelp. At this point we simply walked out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"By far, the best Mexican food I have had in Toronto. This restaurant is tiny, and out of the way, and has a unique juxtaposition to the typical pace of the downtown core. Located in what is seemingly a residential neighbourhood, the restaurant is in a word, quaint. 

Food here was fabulous. As it was my first time, it seemed fitting to go with the house special, the playa burrito - I had no regrets. I was pleased with a spicy mix of cheeses, meat and vegetables that dazzled my palate, which was happily followed up by two delicious Cuban Mojitos. As a side note, these are incredible, I cannot recommend the cocktail enough, it was superb.

My only grievance was that on the back patios, the tables are made with wood panels with gaps between each plank. It was just disgusting  to eat on a table with what appeared to be  week old food for me to stare at. The place was great, but because of this severe hygiene issue, they have to be knocked down a couple stars. Hopefully this issue will be addressed come my next visit.  

Despite this thought, I may very well find myself venturing back for an evening on the patio once the warm weather returns."}
{"text":"Dinner here was okay but not great.  The salsas was fresh and I liked the hot sauces on the table.  The space was very cramped especially for my tall husband.  We felt like we couldn't really get comfortable enough to enjoy ourselves. The tacos were good but the enchiladas wasn't great.  They looked much better then they tasted.  Overall it was an okay experience.  Wouldn't be rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Great patio for warm weather! Had a great time with friends enjoying good tacos, amazing guac, and yummy drinks. 

The outdoor patio sells this place! Especially enjoyable in the evening with decorative lights and relaxing music."}
{"text":"The place is very crammed inside. I prefer a table with room. It was a little uncomfortable.  The hostess i was not found of but the staff on general were very nice. The food was good. Had a couple chips that were stale but the food was good and the  experience was nice.  I don't think I would go back. I think I would try others places first before going back. I definitely think you need to try it for the experience.  I had a great time but it was not my favorite place."}
{"text":"I'm a Texan and my girlfriend is from San Diego, so we know good Mexican when we eat it, and this is excellent Mexican. The dishes were fresh and authentic, and I can't recommend the Margaritas highly enough. Splurge a little and try some of the more expensive blends - seriously the best margaritas I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a small, casual place with excellent food and service.
We were seated promptly and the waitress was attentive and helpful.

The freshly-made chips with salsa was excellent; I have never had tortilla chips that were freshly made before, so they were a real treat. The salsa was very tasty and not overly seasoned.

My steak burrito was very meaty and satisfying, though I wish it wasn't served drizzled with guacamole and cheese sauce; I would rather have had them on the side. But it was very tasty and a good value.

This is a good restaurant if you love Mexican food or even if you are not sure because the menu has a lot of options that will appeal to middle-of-the-road tastes."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here. 

Arrived on a Sunday night around 8pm; it was busier than I thought it would be, but we were promptly seated on the patio. We ordered the ceviche, and a couple of cocktails straight away. The cocktails were great, and the ceviche was meh. 

After a long delay, we were told if we wanted to order mains they would take at least a half hour. This really put me off, especially after the questionable ceviche, and the lengthy wait with empty app dishes and awkwardly still having the menus on the small tables outside. 

I'm sure they serve up some good food, and experiences, but I question the consistency."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and service was very slow despite there only being 3 tables seated in the entire place. Food is passable but there are better Mexican places in Toronto. Fish tacos were bland and Mexican corn was most just hot and not very flavorful. Chorizo burrito with egg on top was better but un memorable."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday (make sure you make reservations as they book up fast)
As to the other reviewers saying they felt rushed, we didnt feel rushed at all.

Ordered the chips with guac (WOW it was amazing) and the bucket of shrimp to start. 

We have the chicken tacos and the beef burrito. The burrito was REALLY good and the tacos, meh. I've had better tacos but they were still good.

The prices were reasonable too.."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos. A bit of a trek from the downtown core. Had reservations but the previous occupants were lounging there, someone in our group had to pester the server a few times because we got too hungry. They were nice to offer us tequila at the end of our meal. Unfortunately, the wait spoiled the experience to go again."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we tried this restaurant.  We got there around 6:30 pm and the place was already packed.  The girl (hostess) was so super nice and did all she could to get us a table as we had no reservations and the place is really small.  The food was really impressive, fresh and delicious.  We ordered the Guaca Fresca, Homemade Chips And Fresh Salsa as appetizers, and our mains were Spicy Mole (Enmoladas) with Chicken and the Rib Eye Carne Asada.  Soooooo good we didn't leave anything left on our plates.  This place is a must try."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican Restaurant in T.O, it should have 5 stars. Make sure you book a reservation the day before there always booked solid. But you maybe lucky and get a table the same day. I am very picky about Mexican food as I was raised with a  Mexican family. The food is amazing the service is amazing and so is the ambiance. PLAYA CABANA ON DUPONT STREET IS THE BEST..."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a saturday. We ordered the fish tacos and chicken tacos and the civiche. The civiche was really good just a small portion. The tacos were really good too although for the price the portion was kind of small. We had churros for dessert and it wasn't that amazing but it wasn't disappointing either. The waitor was alright not amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Playa is typically Toronto. Five star food, the right amount of cool factor to make it \"in demand\" and great food. Go for the fresh fish tacos, the corn on the cob and the cointreau tequila."}
{"text":"Visited Playa Cabana for the first time this week with a group of 6. They seated us right away (made a reservation the day before and they were able to accommodate us). 

The server was great - so attentive, not pushy. Food came out hot and was delicious.

We ordered the ceviche, nachos and sausage appetizer to start. The ceviche was to die for!

For a main I had the fish burrito which was massive but delicious. My friends ordered fish tacos, short rib tacos, and chicken burritos, and everyone enjoyed.

They had made a mistake about one of our orders, and when I mentioned it, the server was so apologetic, and insisted on making me a new one. I said it wasn't a problem, I was full from appys anyways, and she insisted on taking it off the bill.

Not only that, but they came out with free gelato for the table AND tequila shots for the entire restaurant!

The only reason this is a 4 and not a 5 star is the place was crowded and we sat at an awkward high-top table where people kept bumping in to us. 

Otherwise, great time, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have had in the city! The staff shuts down for two weeks in Jan and visits Mexico to absorb the cutlure and stay up to date with the recipes. Their guacamole is bar none and it is reasonably priced. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. Can't wait to sit in their patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Show up at 10:20pm, All the staff gave an awkward glare as we stood in the door way waiting to be served a seat. \"Oh we're closed\" sign says 11:00pm. Other customers inside were eating, the staff looks like they were all set to leave at 11:01 PM sharp! Few staff had their jackets on, maybe they were leaving early banking on no one else would show up. I could see if we showed up 10 mins to close and be turned down. But 40 mins to go, that's sheer laziness. This place looked good, too bad. We went up to Thai Mango up the street. They served us no problem. Thai mangos beer taps and glasses are clean and fresh. Filtered water. Nice decor. Clean and fresh. Tasty food. Too bad playa cabana couldn't take care of us. Boo!"}
{"text":"A bit crowded, but the food was good (though very spicy) and service was decent. It's quite a small place and noise levels can get quite high as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! 

Everything I had tasted amazing. I had the flautas and the beef brisket tacos. Sooo yummmmy! The tres leches cake is also heaven. So creamy and good! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible service 
Came in at 9 was told i was 5th on the waiting list. 
Cane back 45 minutes later.  Hostess is seating walk ins.
I lose it. We get sat right away."}
{"text":"All playa cabana locations that I have tried (Etobicoke, and this one) were awesome. Played burritos, fresh guacamole and pitchers of margarita make for the absolute best night out ever. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"My wife, our  three kids, mother-in-law and I went here last night for my wife's birthday. The food and service was exceptional. I had the braised beef short ribs tacos, and my wife had the fish tacos...wow.  My kids now want to come here again and my little guy who is 5 told the server he is going to call John Catucci from \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" to do their next show there.  It is very small and cramped but just adds to the atmosphere. I'm usually not big on Mexican food so I can't say whether it was authentic or not, but I really enjoyed my meal, and my family was very satisfied as well. We were there on a Tuesday at 6:30 and it was packed.  Thanks Yelp for helping select another great restaurant away from my comfort zone!"}
{"text":"For a Saturday night dinner, I was looking for something interesteing to eat, rather then the usual Bar/American food found in Liberty Village.
I started going through the usual paces, what to eat, what to eat...

Thai...been there done that...too many times.
Sushi...its getting cold..i want something warm and tasty
Mexican! - I loooove Mexican, from the burrito boys, the big fat, to the sit downs, its all good in this belly.

So mexican it is.
We usually hit up Milagro on Queen, but I thought its time for a change.
After reading the reviews we hit up Playa Cabana and I'm glad we did.
Awesome little restaurant.

The place: 
Nice and cozy

Service: 
Quick and attentive

Food: 
Wicked! Everything was fresh and flavorful.
For starters we got the Ceviche - it was haddock that night - so tasty
My entree was the Surf and Turf burrito - with steak and shrimp. covered in some tomato and green sauce. soooo good
My gf got the Short Rib/Brisket tacos..they had fried taco shells - sooo tasty.

Things I wanted to try but couldn't: 
-Fresh guacamole - they allow you to choose your spice level.
-every burrito and taco available on the menu

and all of this was much more affordable then Milagro.

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"So I axs the waiter 'waiter what should I have?\" and he says 'the fish tacos'.  fish tacos?  but hey a leap of faith right?  Brilliant!  and I can't get them out of my mind!!  The waiter was right.

The fish was crunchy in the taco, with other stuff that I couldn't concentrate on and woops it was gone.

This guy knows what he is doing - our meal made us stop talking about us, and start talking about how good everything was, the food and how it tasted.  Then the chef, Dave (?) came out into the restaurant and talked to us about the food ! WOW, and he told us about the desserts, and of course we had to try some!  Incredible.

Now we feels like it is our restaurant and we loves it and we is going back back back."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto, hands down. I always get the chorizo queso tacos, al pastor and fish tacos. Way better than seven lives where they use thick store bought flour tortillas . All of the tacos are well crafted, with the perfect accompaniments to the meat - I hate having to top my own tacos (looking at you again, seven lives), surely certain toppings go better with certain meats! Be sure to make a reservation as its a small space that fills up quickly. There is also some limited street parking available."}
{"text":"I love this place - great atmosphere, amazing food and always fresh! It's even busy on a Tuesday night :)"}
{"text":"My partner and I had an early dinner here today. I had heard good things about this restaurant so I really wanted to check it out. We almost walked right past it, it was so well blended in with its surroundings. I'm giving it 4 stars, however, it is a reluctant 4 as I feel like today it should have been 3, but I have to acknowledge its 5 star potential. Confused enough yet? 

Let me explain:

- HOT SAUCE GAME IS ON POINT. There were 2 different hot sauces at our table and 2 different jars of chilli. For those who like spice, you will be in heaven! 
- The salsa appetizer with daily made tortillas was an excellent appetizer to share - although I usually prefer my salsa ingredients diced rather than blended, it was still very good.
- We had originally ordered the ceviche but the server forgot to put in our order and we only realized once our mains were served with no sign of the ceviche - thought it would be odd to eat ceviche with our burritos so asked for salsa and tortillas instead. The salsa and tortillas was then comped for us, so we were satisfied 
- I ordered the playa burrito with ancho-braised steak - the portion was massive, could not finish it and brought some home with me. While it was delicious, it was served to me lukewarm... I hate when my food is lukewarm... I just didn't want to send it back when we already dealt with the appetizer issue. 
- The restaurant is very small - seating is a little cramped and without resos you may be given a time that you need to be finished by. 

Despite some errors, I do intend to go back - I have a feeling that I went on an off day and want to give this restaurant another shot. There are also many other items from the menu that I would like to douse with their hot sauces!"}
{"text":"Went today with a friend for lunch. great service, split the grilled fish tacos (TACOS DE PESCADO (BAJA-STYLE) and slow roasted pork tacos (TACOS DE CARNITAS). The chicharones on the carnitas were such a great textural lift. Guac was fine, chips with it were better. Will return for some ceviche. Only thing is we didn't eat fast enough and the soft tortillas were tearing. Great atmosphere- very cozy/friendly."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana seems to be on par with Grand Electric in terms of actual mexican and taco authenticity style but is a little more stuffy with the Yorkville crowd flocking here young and old. Where as Grand Electric is a little more Parkdale trendy, fun, laidback and gritty. I came on a Sunday with my boyfriend with no reservations and had to wait for about 35 minutes. Definitely make a reservation as this place is busy. 

We shared  tacos and some guacamole. Like I said, Playa serves some tasty tacos but they come a  little too fussy as I like my mexican simply authentic. Service is decent, our waiter seemed to be a little absent minded but he made up for it in apologetic charm. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because it also seems to be the most expensive in the city for what you get. Not quite worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great atmosphere, incredible food, and awesome service. 

We started with the fish and short rib tacos - both incredible. My wife and I then shared the breaded chicken burrito. The only problem with the menu is that everything looks and sounds SO GOOD it's hard to choose. 

The service was truly as good as it gets. The staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive. They really make you feel welcome. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had! I always get the grilled fish tacos, they are amazing! So delicious and so refreshing at the same time! The service is always impeccable! I love the staff almost as much as I love the food!"}
{"text":"There are lots of great reviews on here for this restaurant - so just adding a note here regarding larger groups. I had a board meeting with a bunch of colleagues nearby and we made a reservation for 8 people. We had a great meal and enjoyed the food and drinks. The ambience and service was excellent, and we all left happy. 

The hassle was that when it came time to pay, we discovered they do not do separate bills. So, we spent the last part of the meal with calculators out trying to parse everything out. Not the end of the world, but a pain nonetheless. It also meant that for those who needed to claim meals they could not get a proper receipt. I'd come back as a couple or with friends but I would not book for groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"Great food. We came as a group and ordered many different Tacos and multiple buckets of beer. All of the tacos were delicious, and they had Corona and Dos Equis to drink. You can get a bucket of four beers for a decent price. Many margarita/sangria drinks available me also, but that's not really my thing. Cool atmosphere, great location and friendly staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"om nom nom. ok disclaimer not everything is equally good

but i'm just going to highlight stuff that struck out to me the most

great ambience, a little loud, open late, great service. TOO DIE FOR BRAISED BEEF TACOS (they look and taste very mexican), above average fish tacos.

they have mexican cola which is great, decent desserts, super fresh and super cheap salsa and chips(3$ woot)"}
{"text":"Excellent. Tried the corn as an appetizer - must have. And then we ordered a burrito (huge) and the enmoladas (also great). Then we tried the Tres Leches cake - honestly the best I've ever had, a MUST HAVE.

Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana had solid food. Loved that they took reservations, portions were good and the staff were very attentive. We started with the bucket of shrimp. \"Bucket\" is probably an overstatement, but still delicious. We then ordered the beef tacos and fried fish tacos - the beef was better. The churros were good but I thought was over priced. Overall, loved Playa Cabana (especially in comparison to its sister Hacienda restaurant)."}
{"text":"Really great service and overall experience. For how exciting and innovative the dishes sounded - some of them fell a bit flat with regards to flavors. However, the cocktails were wonderful and we got our meals in great time. 

I would recommend you do not get seated in the back of the restaurant - it is a bit too close to the hot kitchen and much darker than other areas of the restaurant."}
{"text":"tequila selection - AH-mazing
guac and chips - couldn't be more flavourful
burritos + tacos (brisket ones in particular) - UNIQUE and melt in your mouth orgasmic

this place makes missing NYC mexican food a little less overwhelming :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been too! We came with a large party of 8 and they were very accommodating. Our server was awesome, I wish I could remember his name to give him a shoutout. But overall he was very attentive, gave great drink and food suggestions and was very friendly! We truly enjoyed all the appetizers ( we got the salsa and ceviche), a few pitchers of margs as well. I got the chicken tacos and they were phenomenal. Everyone loved their food and we just had a great time. 

Definitely recommend. We made a reservation as well."}
{"text":"The crispy fried tacos and chips overloaded me - heavier than I'm used too. The chips were super salty too. Make sure you look at the taco description to see if it will be fried.. When combined with generous portions of meat, I got full really fast. 

Also, the place is pretty cramped inside but the service was good.

Prices are reasonable but I was surprised how much they charge for chips, salsa and guacamole."}
{"text":"Memories of LA! We were a party of 6 so we got to sample many offerings. The off menu special was Lobster tacos with generous portions of lobster chunks. Great place hidden within a residential neighborhood. Can't wait to lounge on the patio and try the new location I am told will be on Dupont and Avenue."}
{"text":"In the mood for Mexican food ? Then Playa Cabana would definitely be a win whether you're in for lunch or dinner the food sure won't disappoint you. Came here with my family and I , and ordered the crispy slow cooked chicken tacos and shared the Mexican corn on the cob with my brother for an appetizer. The taco plate may se small and not filling but it definitely is more than enough ( Atleast for me) !! Definitely coming back here :)"}
{"text":"Went there for a drink, amazing ambience in a very cute neighbourhood. You must try the guacamole!!!
Only downside is that it's very small, so you may have to wait for a table."}

Is the taco phase over yet in Toronto? I think not. I know it's been awhile since Playa Cabana first opened but I didn't get a chance to check it out until recently. And now that I did, I regret not finding out about this place earlier!

Ordered: Ceviche of the day 4/5

* Lime and chili marinated seafood served with homemade chips for $9
* This is a perfect appetizer to start your meal
* It is light and refreshing with marinated seafood
* Homemade chips were still hot when they arrived at our table
* It was little on the sour side but still very delicious

Ordered: Cubeta De Camaron 5/5

* A full pound of shrimp tossed in an arbol garlic butter, Cancun style for $16
* This was my favorite dish out of all
* It gets a little messy to eat this but it is so worth it
* Arbol garlic butter gave so much flavor to these shrimps 
* I could order this as my main dish and would be fully satisfied
* This is a must order item!

Ordered: Tacos De Pescado (Baja Style) 4/5

* Baja 'Catch of the day' fish tacos, fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza, 3 for $13
* My favorite taco is hands down, fish tacos and Playa Cabana makes a damn good one
* Fish is battered light and arrives hot on soft tortilla
* 3 tacos for $13 is a very good deal, must order!

Ordered: Ancho Braised Shortrib-brisket crispy tacos 3/5

* AAA Ontario beef shortrib braised in ancho chiles wrapped in fresh corn tortillas and griddled to golden crispiness, 3 for $14
* Honestly I wasn't a fan of crispy taco
* Crispy taco made it really hard to eat this properly
* Although personally I prefer fish taco over meat, it was bursting with flavor

Ordered: Tacos De Langosta 4/5

* Steamed Canadian Lobster in homemade hardshell tacos with guac and queso fresco, 3 for $18
* This was my first time trying lobster taco
* Again, I wasn't the biggest fan of the hardshell taco but still enjoyed what was inside
* They don't skimp out on lobster meat and there were chunks of it inside

Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my lunch at Playa Cabana. The restaurant itself is quite small so make sure to go early or make reservation. Seats are quite close together so it's not the most comfortable but you gotta give a little when it's for awesome food!"}
{"text":"I'm a native Californian, so when deciding to take my fiancee, a Toronto resident, for Mexican food, I thought that I would have to aggressively contain my expectations given that most of my Canadian friends complain about the dearth of good Mexican food here. I was surprised by how delicious the food was but I was dismayed by some aspects of the service. 

First, despite the fact that the restaurant was not remotely busy, we were not approached by a server for at least ten minutes after being seated. In fact, the hostess had to ask another server to see us because our intended one just kind of fu*ked off and attended to maintaining his bizarre Caucasian-Last-Samurai-topknot-bro-on-a-spiritual-granola-journey haircut.  Thanks, guy. 

Our replacement server, Raul, kept the party going and did the damn thing and did so promptly and politely. Commendations to Raul. The food was to our liking, although it does kind of feel like you're paying for the restaurant's comforts when you can get the same caliber food at a truck in Los Angeles for a fraction of the cost. Despite the omitted fifth star, I would urge folks in Toronto desperate for a quality Mexican food experience to try this place out. DEFINITELY make reservations first. There is no harm in doing so and it struck me as the sort of place that is frequently busy, as it was tonight."}
{"text":"everything was fresh and prepared to perfection! my husband and i ordered the ceviche, tortilla soup and chorizo for appetizers. we had the last order of ceviche available for the night and am so happy we decided to get it. the chef prepared it fresh and even asked us if we wanted it a bit spicy. (ceviche of the day 9.00)
the chorizo is locally made and the flavor of the sausage is superb. it is presented sliced in a heavy drizzle of sauce. (chorizo conquistador 8.00)
the tortilla soup was perfectly spiced. (sopa de tortilla 6.00)

for dinner we decided on the chipotle marinated ribeye cooked medium and short rib crispy tacos.
the steak was grilled and accompanied by rice, bean, guac, greens and lime. the steak was slightly undercooked so they quickly regrilled and the second attempt was perfect.  (rib eye asada 18.00)
the three crunchy shortrib tacos were so good. stuffed with braised short ribs and brisket topped with greens crumbled queso blanco tomatoes and pico de galo. they were devoured. it comes with three sauces to adorn it but really not needed. sauces were a green tomatillo, red and guac. (12.00) i ordered side of rice and beans (2.00)
mojito majado was so refreshing. brought back memories of south beach's ocean drive. (8.00)
chef sent out the most delicious passion fruit gelato (for the steak needing to be regrilled.) which was appreciated!
total came out to 75.71 with taxes and my two orders of pepsi/coke.

i will be back this week for dinner yet again. it was that good!"}
{"text":"It's a really tight space here but the food is to die for. Had the baha fish tacos and chicken burrito and I want to eat it all over again. Guaranteed food coma. Reservations are hard to get around peak hours so you're looking at a 9:30-10:00 pm seating if you're lucky. Music can be loud so it's not the greatest place to have a conversation. Washroom cleanliness is alright; cleaned every hour. Pricing is fair and on par. Will return!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Go there all the time, mostly for dinner. There's usually wait unless you've made reservations before, but they have space at the bar sometimes if you're just a couple of people. Would recommend anytime."}
{"text":"Took a day off on Monday in search for the holy grail of seafood tacos... Turns out, many places in Kensington were closed on Monday so we went with Playa Cabana since they had Octopus and Fish tacos. Arrived right when they open at noon and considering how their website looks, expected restaurant/seating to look better and more upscale. Ordered the ceviche to start with the Tacos de Pulpo. Cevice with a side of chips came first. The ceviche was NOT good, fish was barely visible and bowl was full of lime juice, tomato and peppers. Definitely not the authentic ceviche I've eaten in Mexico and Peru and a little steep at $9. Chips on the other hand were fresh and delicious and well seasoned so it was a good vehicle to try all the hot sauces they had on the table. 

Tacos de Pulpo came next, Octopus was cooked nicely, good chipotle-tasting sauce. I should have ordered another tacos de pulpo instead of the ceviche.  For entree, we ordered the fish tacos and the tacos al pastor which came 15-20 mins after they took the dishes from appetizers. By the time I munched through half the chip basket.. Al pastor was good, had a good amount of pork and pineapple which balanced with the red onion. The fish tacos were OK, the slaw was a little bland but after putting the red and green hot sauce it was better. For an entree portion with 3 tacos in the $13-15 price point, I would have expected a larger portion but tacos were the same size as appetizer tacos or street vendor size. Also, authentic tacos usually come with two tortillas.

The bill for 4 dishes came to almost $60 with tax and tip, which I probably could have spent taco hopping at Kensington and been a lot more full/satisfied. Considering the neighborhood though, there will be enough hipsters and upper middle class folk who will come here and tell their friends they had the best fish tacos ever, which I unfortunately did not feel. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love the food, drinks and atmosphere! Great place for a date night, or meeting up with friends. My favourite is a tie between the fish and brisket tacos. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food.  Very small - it's like eating in NY."}
{"text":"Toronto finally has an excellent, almost authentic Mexican restaurant.  Somewhat small and cramped inside, the food makes up for this by miles.  There's also a patio out front (closed on a Wed afternoon and a rear patio) The margaritas, huevos rancheros, enchiladas, chilles rellenos and flautas were all A+.  Service although efficient was just average. Get these servers some personality.  Food came quickly, portions were a good size and nicely presented.  
I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will return when back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Milagro as it was formerly the only real Mexican food I had access to, so I'm really happy Playa Cabana has opened up. The menu is divided up into appetizers, tacos, burritos, and house specials, that includes entrees that don't fit into the other categories, such as huevos rancheros, tostadas, and carne asada.

The guacamole and nachos reminded me of Milagro, but with the option to add spice to it. Honestly though, I like Milagro's guac better, first because they give you a larger portion and second, at Playa Cabana I couldn't taste the other flavours in the guac too much, possibly because we ordered it spicy. The nachos were awesome though, and still warm from the oven (or more likely, the fryer).

We also ordered the chorizo sausage which was smothered in the best tasting sauce I've ever had.  The whole table was dipping their nachos in the sauce after the chorizo was done.  The sausage itself was pretty lean, and I'm a fan of fatty meat, but for a lean sausage, it was pretty good.

The taco dishes come with three small tacos each for about $12. If you're hungry, get the rice and beans on the side for another $2.  The corn tortillas the tacos are made with is fresh and delicious, and the filling (I got skirt steak and chorizo) is okay. They did not disappoint me but did not stand out either.

The burrito dishes are huge portions, so it feels much more satisfying to eat than the tacos.  The sauces on the burrito really made it good, and better than the tacos in my opinion.

For dessert I had a spicy mole gelato that was absolutely delicious. It was rich and chocolatey with a tiny kick of spice at the end.

To drink, try the agave margarita.  It has orange and lime juice and no sugar, just agave nectar.  In my opinion, Playa Cabana's margaritas are perfectly made. They also have Jarritos pop and Mexican pop made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup - you actually CAN taste a difference!!

I highly recommend making a reservation here. The place is small, and was rammed the entire night.  I can't wait until summer when the patio is open - you will definitely find me there, sipping margaritas."}
{"text":"Really good burrito and the guacamole is delicious. Pairing that with a sangria mhmmmm.... Must try! The patio is really nice as well!"}
{"text":"At the Playa... Playa Cabana,
A buzzy taco spot north of Havana (here)
Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
There was premium tequila at the bar...

I've been hearing a lot about Playa and I had to try these tacos for myself.

I was hosting a food event here and booked online.
Additionally, I received a confirmation email the day of my reservation and I thought it was all good.  It turns out they didn't have my reservation.

Luckily, they had some space and gave us a table (it's still not that easy to get a reservation here for 6 people, they have 3 seatings and 7pm is the most popular).
They said they prefer it when people make reservations online, so that they have proof they reserved.  Which didn't make any sense to me, since clearly their system sucks.

They said even with reservations made over the phone, they still make mistakes. 
Great.  Good to know.

Anyways, the place is tiny.
Like PACKED tiny. With no where to put your coats or purses, or anything.

I started with their signature margarita ($9).  Salted rim, could have been more limey but not bad.  Not cheap either, but that's because of the grade of tequila.

For starters, we had the crab cakes and ceviche.
The crab cakes were little tender moist meatballs of crab.
Not very crispy but soft and tasty but maybe more filler than crab meat.

The ceviche came with fried tortilla chips.
I didn't love the ceviche.  It was very runny and mostly onion bits and not seafood.

The fish tacos were okay.  You have to pay a dollar more for grilled fish.
I found the fish overcooked and a bit bland.  ($14)

My side chopped salad was $3 and had more kick than the fish tacos.
The shortrib crispy tacos were way tastier.  I should have gone with those!

For dessert, the churros are timbit sized fried deliciousness.
The three milk cake was a surprise.  It was a huge slice with buttery cream.

Overall, I had an okay experience here.  But with all the taco places popping up around the city, I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to return to Playa (and yes, I consider Dupont and Davenport out of the way, so your food better be awesome)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and they were very accommodating with drinks (asked for a cocktail to be made without sugar and they had no problem). They give an appetizer platter for the table for free, which nearly filled us up as is. The tacos were amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. I only took away a star as it was so loud in there it's hard to hear your table and have to talk on the top of your voice. I'll definitely recommend and will be back, especially if I don't mind a bit of a headache that night lol"}
{"text":"Oh man...what an outstanding meal!  Family and I showed up without a reservation (early) on a Saturday night and they were extremely accommodating.  Wife started off with a margarita cocktail that she loved so much she had a second.

We started the table off with some appetizers...homemade chips, salsa and guacamole were all flavorful (especially the salsa with its slight kick).  Chips had just been fried so they were pillowy yet crisp.

For dinner, we ordered several dished for the four of us to share.  The ancho beef short rib tacos were hearty and oily-saucy but our favorite dish on the table. The chorizo burrito was spicy and had two great sauces (one red and one green) and an over-easy egg on top.  My wife loves fish tacos, so that was dish #3...she loved them!

Fun (intimate) atmosphere in a lively setting.  Given the chance we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We just had lunch there and the food was good. I personally prefer La Carnita but it was still good. However, the service here was terrible. We had to ask our server (Chris) twice to bring us water in the beginning. The food took an hour to arrive and when we asked the server why it was taking long, his response was \"well it's busy\". Fine, I can understand that. I used to be a server but it would've been nice to apologize or acknowledge that they're busy before we had to ask for it. Then when the food came, it all came separately so we had to wait another 10 minutes from the time we got the first plate to the time we got the last plate. So overall, we will not be back and do not recommend this place as there are way better Mexican restaurants with way better service."}
{"text":"wow... i love their food a lot... so much! just a bit cramped but i don't mind... it's better to have a reservation than walk in..."}
{"text":"Really good food
Has the lobster hard shell tacos and they were amazing
Only downside was the table was very crammed due to the narrow setup of the restaurant 
Sever was great"}
{"text":"Toronto's Mexican-food renaissance is in full swing!  You heard it here first.

Somehow managed to snag a table without reservation on a Friday night (tip:  make a reservation, this was a fluke) and found the reservation bustling with a fun, energetic crowd.  This restaurant is small - so the vibe of the place is good when a nice crowd is there having fun.

I proceeded to eat what is probably the best Mexican food I have had outside of Mexico or SoCal.  Ceviche, salsa, chips, baja tacos, flautas - all were perfectly prepared and exploding with taste.  Service was quick and friendly, the meal was comfortable and enjoyable.

There have been a few recent additions to Toronto's Mexican food scene along with some established reliables - Playa Cabana is a welcomed addition to the family.  The quality of Mexican food has really gone up over the last few years - the renaissance is in full swing, lets hope it continues.

I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu.  This is my new favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious.

Went labour day monday and the place was packed. despite making a 7pm reservation, had to wait for another 20 for a table... not shocking, considering the place is teeny. i was a bit annoyed, but felt better once we grabbed a drink at the bar. the bartender was pretty rad, and made a pretty delicious drink which was off-menu (because i asked for something with Tromba Tequila). 
once our table was ready, we scanned the menu and promptly ordered the made-to-order guac. chips were good, guac was just alright.

i was a bit concerned, as my partner is quite the picky eater and turns his nose up at anything he can't see a picture of or read what's in it.

he ordered a veggie burrito - sans dairy (so happy they were accommodating)
i ordered the 16 pepper and nut mole - veggie.
my cousin ordered something with chorizo and a fried egg on top.

what a relief when my partner dug in and said that it was delicious. what's even better is that he tried mine and thought that next time he would order what i ordered.
i thought that the mole was awesome. not too sweet, just the right amount of savoury...and the filling was mushrooms and zucchini all marinated and soft. yum!
i tried the chorizo dish and it was also pretty delcious. 
the black beans and rice were also flavoured awesomely.

if you're looking for someplace to go and willing to wait, go here. the flavours are worth the wait. and there's something for everyone.

note: mondays are lobster monday. want to go back and try the seafood."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Toronto! 
Beef and chorizo hard tacos made just perfectly! 
The trio desert is also a must! 

Def recommend this place and def will stop by once a month to get my dose 

Peace and love"}
{"text":"I haven't really had real good Mexican food until I came here! The food was so good that I had to come back a second time with my friends. I love how many options they have on their menu and the service was friendly and fast. Their sauce goes so well with their tacos. Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants that are clean and have good flavours!

Can't wait to go back again when I'm craving real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Back at playa after a year for dinner date with my girlfriends. Started with guacamole- way too smooth for our liking and lacked flavour. We ordered braised beef tacos which was okay not to tasty and oily. Steak Beef burrito was delicious and the tres leche cake was very dry. Over the years their service and food quality has gone down. Back in the day hey used to make their tortillas in house as you wait to it they now get delivered - as we were leaving they got a delivery. Definitely not going back, there are better authentic places out there. This one is overrated."}
{"text":"The margarita was mediocre. Definitely not the best I've had. I had the carnitas burrito, my burrito was really good and huge. My sister had the fish tacos, they were ok, certainly have had better. My sisters bf had the chicken wings (I know who orders chicken wings here but he is always a bit iffy about trying new things) the chicken wings took forever also they were the worst chicken wings I have ever had. We waited for our whole order a long time probably 30 mins. What really left the worst taste in my mouth was the server. He never checked on us, he delivered the food and the next time he came he was packing up the food. He didn't ask why only one chicken wing was eaten. He just gave us the bill. We asked for it to be split into three, and then I realized he had added a side of beans on the bill, he took it off and that was no problem. After my sister had already paid her third and left him a decent tip, and her bf asked for his change when he gave him a 100 dollar bill. He came back and asked was there anything wrong with the service? Cuz now he has to pay for our meal because the kitchen takes 16%. Honestly I'm a server too and it sucks when people don't tip, especially when you go above and beyond. But my sister had already left him about 8 bucks and he had the nerve to say anything because he asked for his change. How did he know how much he was gonna leave on the table. I hadn't paid yet too, it was the worst ending to a nice night we were having. Also I think he charged me more for the burrito, it said 19 and now that I think about it I'm pretty sure the carnitas burrito said 17. I guess that's why he took the receipt away right away. In conclusion, not coming back here again"}
{"text":"Location: Right by Dupont subway station. There are some paid parking nearby.

Price: Overall, it came down to around $25/person after ordering appetizers, tacos/burritos, and alcoholic drinks. 

Food: The fried baha fish tacos were delicious! The batter is thin and super crispy, but not oozing grease. I'd say this is a must-get, especially if you're pain-avoidant and can't handle spice. The octopus tacos were very tender, yet charred just enough for the flavour to be strong. It's on the spicy side though, but you can ask for the non-spice version. Their home-made nachos were thick and crispy. They also offer sugar-cane Coca cola if you want to avoid high fructose corn syrup drinks. The burrito was gigantic and covered in sauce and veggies. 

Service: Very quick service, and the waiter was very helpful.

Overall: delicious Mexican food that's well cooked. Book ahead if you want a place inside. We walked in and only the patio had seats."}
{"text":"I dream about this place. Their guacamole and bottomless chips are addictive. My friends and I devoured two orders of it and they just kept asking us if we wanted more chips. Um, yes. Never stop giving them to me. The enchiladas suizas are amazing, and the jarritos are a nice non-alcoholic option. The tres leches cake makes me want to cry, it's so good.

It's a tiny place so make sure to have reservations, and it's good to note that it can get very loud. If you can deal with a somewhat cramped and lively space for the fantastic food, then you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Great mojitos
LOVE the food. Especially the octopus tacos and bucket of shrimp!
Have been here 3 times and will keep coming back for fresh delicious tacos. Yumzo!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing but please please reserve before you go. A party of 8 had arrived before us and the host said their reservation hadn't shown up on their system (how awful). Make sure you have a confirmation of your registration too to make things easier. 

Anyway, we were seated immediately - very packed place but the vibe is very nice, loud and lots of chatter. 

Ordered:
Ceviche with fresh chips
Beef short ribs tacos (3)
Fish of the day tacos (3)

Everything was nicely timed - once we finished the Ceviche,  the tacos were brought out after 5 minutes. We started with the fish and asked for it grilled instead of battered..great option! It was light and there was slaw with it. So good. 

Next, the beef short ribs tacos were outofthisworld good!! I wish I could order more but by that time we were full.

Use that paper napkin..avoid the grease and sauces falling down your hands..haha

Bill came to $80 tax and tip in, with drinks.

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"In terms of inner city Mexican food, this is one of Toronto's greats. Expect your mouth to be assaulted with flavour. The menu is a perfect size, plus they offer Mexican Coke! The quality is so high that they could easily get away with higher prices and wouldn't lose very many people. A must try for anyone even mildly interested in the cuisine."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Playa Cabana is tucked away from the main hustle and bustle of downtown (yet is still close by) so you feel as if you discovered a local joint that only the who's who knows about. The restaurant is on a quiet street among homes and there is a really cute patio in front that you can imagine being packed on a hot summers day.

The inside is so cozy and charming that you know you're just going to love the place. But the food is so yummy and BIG and satisfying. The burrito's are MONSTER and the length of one full arm so beware of food-coma after. The ceviche is refreshing and light and perfect for sharing. I had the Chile Relleno which is one of my favorite Mexican dishes: fried pepper (with egg batter) with cheese and glorious filling inside. YUM!
It doesn't matter how full you are, the Tres Leche cake is divine. Rich, moist cake topped with whipped cream (O.M.G!) Must have no matter what.

There is a nice beverage menu that will go perfectly well with your meal: cerveza, tequila, vino y mucho mas!

Service was excellent: warm and all smiles.

This place was packed when my friends arrived and people just kept on coming. There are two tables for larger groups and a couple of smaller tables at the front of the restaurant. We were told we had a two hour seating limit which was fine (any longer and we would have snoozed at our tables).

If you ever have a chance to come here, you MUST. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Need Better Service/Management... 
Waited over half an hour while they cleaned 3 tables and the manager chitchatting with friends.  Then a server tell us that everything is reserved. 

One of those places where they look at you and hope there's no eye contact and then look away... Bad Business! 

No common courtesy to check on the people standing by the entry."}
{"text":"This was actually my runner-up option for dinner but because my first option wasn't opened, I unwillingly came here and am so happy I did. They are located on dupont and can easily missed if you're not paying attention. It's a quaint restaurant with a patio in the front.

Came by after work for dinner and we ordered:

Al Pastor Taco 3 for $13 - marinated pork with pineapples and toppings. I've been searching throughout the city for al pastor taco that is remotely similar to those I've had in LA and I think it's safe to say that these are the closest I've had and I'm thrilled to put an end to my search.

Grilled fish taco with rice and black beans $18-20...? - their freshly grilled fish (although not very flavourful) was delicious! Taco usually has two corn tortilla per taco but this place only uses one so our fish taco ripped quickly and made a mess everywhere! The rice and beans were meh - rice tasted like ketchup fried rice.

The server was nice and came by the check on us. Be sure to try their hot sauce! It gives everything a nice kick. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great and fresh. So full of wonderful flavors! The server was friendly. The atmosphere is lively and fun. The prices are high but the taste is worth the cost."}
{"text":"I have heard much hype about this place and thought I'd try it out, and to be honest I was definitely not impressed at all. If you are looking for something authentic, you won't get that here. The food wasn't horrible, it was ok but nothing to rave about. 

We went on a Tuesday night, the place was super busy and we had to wait a while for a table. The restaurant itself is really small, if your claustrophobic I wouldn't go there. The tables are so close together that the back of your chair is touching the persons chair behind you. 

Service was a 2.5/5 for me because after the long wait, once we did sit at the table no one had come over for a while. Once our server came over he seems frustrated, which i guess is understandable because it was busy but he could have been more friendly. I had ordered a sangria and was unaware that it was grapefruit based, and he switch it for a glass of wine which I appreciated. We ordered Nachos a la Plancha for an app (not actual nachos, it was two pieces of tortilla), which took some time coming out, and the beans were a bit burnt. I had taken maybe 3 bites before the server came over and said our mains our ready and needs to clear the nacho plate, too which we grabbed our piece and he took the plate away so fast that we didn't even get a chance to take the jalapeños that came on the side. We didn't even get to enjoy our app because we were being rushed for our mains. Again, because of how small the place is, the table wasn't large enough to hold 3 plates at once. 

For our mains we got Tacos de Pollo al Carbon ( 3/4 because they were super small and not filling at all for the $, and there was more red onion than anything else. Once i picked off most of the onion, there wasn't much left at all. Ordered a side of guacamole to make it more filling, it came in a 2oz cup and was over $3!) and the Toluca Choriza Burrito (4/5 because it was filling for the $, tasted the best out of everything we had ordered)

For dessert we tried the Churros and Tres Leches cake, which were the biggest disappointment. The Churros tasted like nothing but oil, and they had dolce de leche on them, but the sauce was really runny and watered down, not your usual thick dulce sauce. We couldn't even finish them. The Tres Leche was the most non authentic. It tasted like a regular boxed sponge cake, super dry and the only milk it had was on the plate. 

We were almost the last people in the restaurant and we definitely felt rushed throughout our meal. 

I'll give points for the decor because it was pretty cool, but other than that  
I wouldn't spend my money here again."}
{"text":"If you want really good mexican food paired with some fine tequila, then this is the spot. It gets pretty busy here and it is a good idea to make a reservation. The restaurant itself is pretty small so there is limited seating available. I went on a date here in the summer and we got to sit on the patio.  We tried the flautas, the crispy chicken tinga tacos, and the tacos de pescado. They have an impressive tequila menu, there's even a $100 shot.    Of course I didn't try that one but I had a few of the others that ranged between $10 and $15 per shot. Overall everything was excellent and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place needs a reno. Food is consistent over the years but it smells like dirty mop water and the seating is way to uncomfortable. 

Food is good but needs to go to the next level now . Time for a change."}
{"text":"I am obliged to give this place a perfect rating, although we didn't get to have the main entrees at this place. Things actually went quite wrong for us, but it wasn't really the restaurants fault, and they made up for it with the outstanding treatment we got.

Here is the story:

We were new to town, and my family craved Mexican. Naturally, we searched for the highest rated Mexican in town on Yelp, and this place came up. The entire village, including a 11 month old baby, got in the car, and drove here. At first look, it didn't look right. This place is tiny (imagine a 1200 squarefoot converted townhouse), and it was super packed... at 5pm on a Wednesday night! 

The set-up is definitely more of a hipster bar than what you may envision as a Mexican restaurant. Definitely not a large family dining choice, especially because it is extremely loud with all the huddle people, and the entire ambiance is quite low-light. I wouldn't call it \"a little Cuban hideaway\" as another reviewer has here... it is clearly more catered towards, let's just say fashion-forward and avant-garde type of pretty young people.

Since all the reviews were all absolutely raving on Yelp, we decided to stay. By divine intervention, we actually got a table because another large group had cancelled their reservation. All is okay, we ordered a single drink and an appy. The hiccup was our main order. 30 minutes after having ordered, our main order was still \"15 minutes\" away according to the waiter, the culprit being that we wanted our hamburger \"well done\". Fair enough, I can see most of the other people there were not watching the clock, and obviously sitting down for the long haul, sipping on their excellent mojitos. For us, the problem was that we had a baby in tow, and he was already at his limit. We simply couldn't wait any longer.

So we all got up to leave, none of us exactly happy because we are all now starving, and we didn't get to taste the food that looked fantastic. On our way out, we wanted to pay for our drink and appy.

The redemption was the manager. He apologized profusely, and offered us a discount if we waited a bit longer to get everything to go. Unfortunately the baby couldn't tolerate even five minutes more. Realizing this, the manager apologized again, then refused to accept payment for the stuff we had already eaten, despite our insistence. He just asked us to come back again.

Yes, I think I will. This was the best customer service experience in recent memory."}
{"text":"The tacos and burritos were really quite good; definitely recommended for those who enjoy authenticish mexican food and a relaxed setting.

Went for lunch and contrary to the cries about definitely needing a reso, wasn't a big deal for a table of two."}
{"text":"Okay, their burritos are honestly so amazing. Really filling and not too pricey. The sangria on the other hand was $40 - we didn't even bother checking the price before ordering it. But the sangria wasn't watered down so in the end, my friend and I told ourselves that it was worth it."}
{"text":"In between our office and hotel, this was the perfect choice for us. We were seated in the back alcove . They sell beers by the bucket so we said why not? Our server was nice and didn't rush us or anything. I got the carnitas tacos and they were good. Pretty authentic food."}
{"text":"Ever the fan of this small Toronto chain, and only ever experiencing the Junction location on Dundas before I jumped at the opportunity  to try out the place where it all started last weekend.

If you're looking to try any of the 4 Playa Cabanas out, I recommend you make resos and make them early in the week. We were lucky when trying to make a reso for 4 on a Friday at the last minute that they were able to fit us in for a set amount of time. 

Parking is a bit wonky here so I'd recommend you also hail a cab to get here as I'm not sure that taking the TTC to get here is possible later on in the evenings/weekends.

We grabbed our table and hunkered down for what I anticipated would be an equally amazing meal to what I've come to expect. 

It's a small place, and when packed you'd be hard pressed to back your chair up without backing into someone so if you like your space then maybe pick a less busy night. That said, if you like a cozy lively dining experience then this is your jimmy-jam friendo!

What I liked:
- Three choices in guacamole (mild medium and hot), we ordered a hot for the fellas and a mild for our ladies who weren't as fond as the spice. I'm no master spice connoisseur but the hot was a 2 alarm at best (our of 5) so I think even someone with spice sensitivity can handle it. Came out quick with amazing tortilla chips as expected. Always a winner
 
- Tacos, the short rib tacos are the house speciality and they certainly deliver in taste and in presentation. The meat was tender the fillings were excellent and the tortillas were a lovely cross between soft and crispy.

- service, friendly, helpful and attentive. Despire beign slammed, we never waited too long for anything including re-ups on drinks and/or asking questions

What I didn't like:
- Tacos, yes I know I said I liked them, and I definitely do, but unlike the Hacienda and Cantina locations, you're only allowed to order 3 of the same kind of tacos, where the other locations you can order singles. To get a fourth of the same kind will run you and extra $4. Just my preference but I like my choice when I'm splurging my calories on a taco night out

- Space, As i mentioned, it's a tight fit, I like a little more room, not much but a little.

Overall a good experience, but I'm definitely more partial to Cantina and I'm looking forward to trying Hacienda soon as well as their new Annex location which is a Korean fusion style joint!

Eatcrest Out!

PS - even saw titan of Canadian grocery business Gaelan Weston doing taco take-away while we were eating. Not a big sighting, but cool to know a multi-billionaire still enjoys good tacos at the same spot the rest of us do."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant! We almost missed it when we parked. My boyfriend and I showed up on a Saturday night without reservations, and luckily they had a table available immediately. I would recommend making reservations, as the dining area is small and always busy. 

What it lacks in size, it makes up for in quality of food. Toronto isn't known for their Mexican food, but this place breaks the mould. We ordered the guac and chips to start, baja fish tacos and steak burrito as mains, and the homemade lemonade to drink. The food was fresh and flavorful. The lemonade was on the sweet side, but good. We left full and happy and will be returning."}
{"text":"Had the Octopus Taco (Tacos de Pulpo)

Very fresh and delicious octopus taco. The combination of ingredients (corn, guacamole, and the special sauce) gives a unique taste to this taco.

Space in the restaurant is pretty small and tight though."}
{"text":"Sister took me to this place, treated her to a birthday lunch.

That said, it was nice to get away from the bustling downtown atmosphere, as it's by residential properties. 

The ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS were the best... Hands down. The crispy shells were drenched in beef juice, the meat was soft and tender.. And it came out fresh.

I had the Baja Tacos, and they were good - the tortillas were not the freshest and it was a little stale. Fish tho was great and complimented well with onions, avocado and mayo (I believe). 

Definitely would revisit this restaurant and sister restaurants..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was sub par. I would give 5 stars if the service was as good as the food. 

Our waiter was friendly, took our orders, brought the appetizers and then never came back. Never to ask about food, never to ask for more drinks, nothing. He disappeared to go talk on the phone! 

We had to flag another waiter down for even water. 
Then again flagged another waiter for my bill. 
The other waiters seemed very attentive, asking their tables about drinks, food and desserts. Not us, our waiter was inside on the phone. 

Eventually I asked another waiter to bring my bill and he sent our server out. I asked him what happened to him and he said \"We are inside polishing the forks!\". 

Well excuse me, didn't know the forks being polished were more important than your customers!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, good service. Ate at great restaurants in Mexico. This place is as good or better!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends before going over to Casa Loma for an event. Till this day, I still think about the chips and the guacamole (I can see it's very popular). Anyway, the service was above and beyond considering we went on a very busy evening, and even though we didn't have a reservation, they were able to seat the four of us. The waiter was very attentive, our food arrived on time (I order some beef rib tacos and they were absolutely delicious. I can't remember what else my friends ordered but I remember they all enjoyed what they got very much) and the overall atmosphere was lovely and cozy (on a busy night it can be a bit cramped, it's not a very big place). 12/10 on experience. I would love to go again to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Having heard nothing but great things, and with my foodie boyfriend in town for only one more night, I knew this was our best bet for a date night. We called several times earlier in the day, but couldn't get through. After booking a reservation elsewhere, I called one last time. I was told they had 48 requests for reservations overnight and a table was unlikely. They sensed my disappointment and offered to wait list us and call if something came up. An hour later they called with availability for 2. Yesss!
We arrived early and ordered a margarita while we waited for our table. The hostess recommended the Amber Margarita, it was a great choice If your looking to stick to the classics, not too sweet. One was enough. 
Now seated and keeping with our preference of asking waiters for recommendations, we ordered Guacamole Fresca and Ceviche of the Day (Marlin) as apps and Ancho Braised Brisket Tacos for him and Chile Rellenos for me. 
Our eyes were exceedingly bigger than our bellies. Next time we will share an entrée, or skip the apps altogether, but wanting to explore the menu as much as possible, we ordered and took a doggie bag for the next days lunch. 
The guacamole was good... fresh, flavorful and not too garlicky. The medium heat was more like mild, next time I'll give the hot a try. 
The ceviche was a little disappointing. Coming off a trip to San Francisco where I had excellent ceviche at Fresca for the first time, my standards were maybe a bit high. The blend was fresh and citrusy, with a great kick of heat. I would have preferred if the fish was more tender and not chopped into the same small cubes as everything else in the mix. Also, it might be because I got my tortilla fill on the guac, but I would have preferred the ceviche was served with plantain chips for variation. 
The tacos were some of the best I've had. Smokey and tender meat filled the flaky, soft shells. Served with their delicious seasoned rice, crema and salsa, it was the perfect Mexican meal. At least until we tried the oaxacan cheese stuffed rellenos. Breaded, fried, and placed on top of creamy tomato sauce, it was mouthwatering. With the rice, guac and salsa at its side, it was the perfect mix of flavours and textures. The only problem with this entree is that it made me regret ordering the apps because I could only have a few bites before feeling completely stuffed. 
I cannot wait to go back, intentionally order less, so I can fully enjoy my entire meal while it's hot and fresh. Service was good. The vibe is casual and cool, mixed with authentic Mexican decor."}
{"text":"This afternoon we went to Playa Cabana and were very impressed with the food and drinks! The bar service however was painfully slow. Our server John was AMAZING. He sets a new standard for customer service! Many restaurants could be taught a lesson from him. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Very tasty meal it was very savoury! Its a very small place but the inside look of the place is great! They gos a lot of different mexicain beer! (Why can't we get any XX amber in canada) the portion are good ! And it's tasty ! Next time I would taste their Margarita!!!"}
{"text":"I came here last night. We didn't have a reservation and got lucky as there was a no show.  I suggest making a reservation. 

The hostesses and our server were lovely! Seriously, great service here :) The decor reminded me of a little place in Mexico from the random lit up signs, to the wobble tables, and (sadly) the run down restroom. 

I had a margarita that did not contain simple syrup.(can't remember the name, but it is the second on the margarita list)  It was tart and delicious.  BTW this is an authentic style place, so there are no frozen margaritas.  This suited me just fine.  It's not summer anymore!
 
The tacos are a la carte, and where this differs from a little place in Mexico is that they are priced at $6, instead of $1... So much for authenticity, lol. 

I had the grilled haddock taco - skip this. BLAND

Tuna taco - a bit bland

Braised beef taco - tender and delish. 5 stars

Chicken Burrito - YUM 5 stars! It's large so share it if you are ordering a bunch of things.

There is a red hot sauce and a green hot sauce on the table. Both are excellent. The Green is VERY hot. 

I will return for sure. This is a fun place to go with friends or a date!"}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about Playa Cabana. I heard they rush people out. I don't like this. I heard some people say the tacos are amazing and others claim they are not authentic. After enjoying dinner there tonight, I'd say the latter is pretty much horseshit.

Let's break it down like this:

Environment: wonderful, but you couldn't comfortably spend a lot of time lingering here. The decor of the room is super cool and you feel like you're in a bar in Mexico. Props for decor. 

Service: They did get a little rush-y at the end, but it was pouring rain outside and we'd already lingered a bit waiting for it to stop, so actually, they were pretty hospitable. If is hadn't been raining, I would not have found a reason to stay after finishing our food and drinks. Our server wad friendly and recommended a few things for us.

Food: UH MAZ ING. Are you freaking kidding me? The quality and quantity of meat in the Short Rib Tacos was staggering. So tender and scrumptious. The flavours were making me tingle-- in a good way! Who are these pendejos that say the food is not authentic? They vary the shells up a little, but they are definitely tasty and display traditional Mexican seasoning and flair. Let's also not forget that Mexico is a very big country with cooking styles as diverse as Italy and India. What one region dresses their tacos with is not what another region will do.

Pendejos.

My friend had the Toastadas with Barbacoa and Chicken. The tostadas are large and very good. I'd say for a smaller meal: tacos. Medium meal: Toastadas and large meal: Burritos. I'm a piggy and was stuffed after the tacos. My friend took some of her toastadas home. I am still stuffed after heading out for a couple of drinks and a bike ride across the city.

Value: under $100 with tax and tip for a pitcher of margs, guac, tostadas and tacos.

I would happily come here again and again. Very impressed and am not surprised that this place does so well. It's also too far north and off the beaten path for the hipsters. Not a beard or a pair of skinny jeans in sight!"}
{"text":"I did not like Mexican food. where ever we went I always try to eat nothing until i found this place. love their guacamole, the chicken taco and that giant burrito. thank you for making me love Mexican food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun, eclectic latin hot spot, this is it! Do you and your friends a favour and check this place out. The food is fresh, authentic, and has something for everyone. You'll have trouble picking just one appetizer and even more trouble deciding on a main. Their drink menu had a wide variety of margaritas, wine/sangria, and tequila-straight up. Make a reservation though because this place fills up fast. The dimly lit, yet vibrant ambience make you want to stick around for a while too.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The quaint atmosphere and super friendly staff were fantastic. Great margaritas, good price, great food. Tacos were sobgood we ordered twice. It is a bit tight between tables but everyone was very kind about it."}
{"text":"The best guac I've had here in Toronto! Tucked just east of Davenport on Dupont, I found Playa Cubana yesterday for lunch and was very impressed. Though the street-front patio is a little cramped, the food and service were excellent. I think I've found my new favourite Mexican place. Can't wait to try the ceviche'!"}
{"text":"I had almost resigned myself to the fact that Toronto was devoid of terrific, almost authentic Mexican cuisine. Sure, Milagro has a couple decent dishes but overall it's underwhelming. There are some good burrito spots (Bandidos being the best) but for pure sit-down Mexican the landscape was bare - until Playa Cabana came into my life. I have ordered almost every item on the menu and every one was so good that I can't pick a favorite. So good. Just go. But don't touch my tacos."}
{"text":"Lobster tacos, need I say more? Decent portions of lobster in the tacos. We also had the beef and fish tacos. All great. It is nearby Dupont station so it is easy to get to on public transport. Make sure you don't fill yourself up on the chips before the main course."}
{"text":"The good: Housemade corn chips. Tasty, fresh guac. Zesty beverage (Playa Paloma). Friendly, efficient service. Tacos de pescado. Insanely spicy hot sauce. Monster sized slice of tres leches cake. B-list Canadian celebrity sighting.

The bad: Incredibly cramped seating.

The ugly: Snobbish, disinterested hostess."}
{"text":"I have been to many different playa cabana locations and I must say that they have great tacos! I have had some times where the service is slow, however, the food is always great and satisfying"}
{"text":"Food was excellent - but first time I made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of time (only spot I could get) and then the day of the place called and left a message canceling my reservation without any explanation! Wow - OK - made another reso because I kept hearing how wonderful this place was. Yes, the food is to die for but very messy (the shrimp is unreal but insanely messy - don't wear anything nice. The service horrible, you can't actually enjoy the food because they are so hustling you throughout so they can seat others."}
{"text":"Overall experience was really good! Ordered the enchiladas suizas filled with pork and it was delicious...I cleaned the plate inc. all rice and beans.  For 15$ you can't go wrong.  Also shared the beef shortrib tacos and that's where I had to give it a 4/5.  The meat hands down delicious,  the hard taco shell on the other hand was greasy and tasted like old oil.  Too bad I was looking forward to it.  All desserts were good too...sample a bit of each!"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana never disappoints. Out if all the Mexican places I have tried, this is definitely the best. You can't go wrong getting any of their tacos. I've tried almost every taco on the menu and my favourite a are the Chicken Tinga and the El Pastor. I highly recommend getting the guacamole and chips for the table (they will be gone in no time) and the flautas."}
{"text":"Seriously, THE best Mexican restaurant ever! I just love this little restaurant so much that I cant get enough of it. I even took my parents there once and between the three of us we had 3 pitchers of Margaritas! yup, its THAT good!

Make sure you make a reservation though, the place is pretty small, and always packed no matter what night of the week it is. Its pretty loud in there too, so don't expect a romantic date night there. but its a MUST try restaurant, the food is just amazing, they've done a pretty good job with the decor too. I cant wait to try the patio. 

For the trying-so-hard-to-stay-in-shape-calorie-counter FOOD lovers, try their bean salad. Its soooooooo yummy and filling but really healthy and low in cal!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I love all of it. Give me tortilla chips and some salsa and I am a happy lady. But there is so much more to Playa Cabana than just chips and salsa. Thanks for opening this resto so close to where I live!

What I wanted to mention first is that I don't think it's fair to judge this restaurant when you were there with a group of 26. This restaurant does not fit 26 people. If you were there once you would realize that very simple fact. I wouldn't go here with more than 6 people (unless the patio area gives them more space in the summer). It's not fair to score them down solely based on being a difficult group for any restaurant. With 26 people, you would have issues at any resto.

We ordered the cerviche, chips and salsa to start. The chips were nice and crispy, the salsa was very fresh and nicely spiced and the cerviche was amazing.

I had the tostadas as my main meal with carrnitas. The dish was simple, fresh and not overloaded with many other toppings which would have hidden the flavours. Very delicious. 

I also tried their higher end margarita and it was awesome and authentic. Sometimes margaritas are made too sweet but this one was very good and refreshing.

I will definitely be back here many times to try out all the other things on the menu and as suggested here, the Mexican cola. Can't wait to go back and can't wait to check out the patio in the summer. You cannot go wrong with some mojitos on a patio."}
{"text":"We arrived without a reservation (foolish in hindsight) but they were able to accommodate us with minimal wait and it was totally worth it. I have been searching high and low for a decent Mole in Toronto and this place absolutely blew me away! 
Can't wait to return :)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times - I have friends that live in the neighbourhood.  The restaurant is indeed small but intimate in a fun way - dining at night is the best.  In nice weather, the patio adds some needed extra room.  No AC in the summer, just open windows.

Service was amazing on my first visit and average on my second.

Food isn't bad - I thought it was decent but not outstanding.  I think it's a little overpriced considering the portions; ie: the chips and salsa isn't huge but costs you $5 each time even for a refill.

Overall, this is really just a place of convenience for me to go to.  I have a few other preferred places in the city for the same type of food.  But for a snack and a few drinks, it's a pretty good option."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in this place after reading the glowing reviews and hearing how amazing it was from my friends.

The Hubster and I came in for a dinner and it was PACKED! The servers were very nice, though there was some miscommunication about whether or not they would sit us at a table that we would need to vacate in a couple of hours. We would have taken the table, but weren't positive that we were given the choice.

Anyhow, we were sat very soon after the time we had our reservation so I was happy. We were sat in the back, which is their back patio covered by a big tarp, which I thought was very very fun, particularly since it was a super windy day. 

The service was very friendly and we never really had to wait for anything. Cocktails were delicious and food was tasty (big portions!) but not mind blowing. 

It was a fun night and we enjoyed ourselves, but I'm not sure that it's worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out. 
Just recently traveling to mexico, I was craving some mexican food in a mexican environment. 
I drove down there with my girlfriend, very cool part of the Annex. Quiet street, pretty cool idea to put a restaurant there. 
We sat down, it was very busy. So far so good. I liked the atmosphere. Even though our waitress didn't speak spanish. Our food came and wow was i disappointed!!! 14$ for our main course and it was 3 small mini tacos........How could they charge that and serve this as a meal......I ate it it, asked for the check and left. We were still not full and still hungry so we had to stop for pizza on the way home."}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was really great. Cocktails were amazing.  However, they turned off the music with a half an hour left until close. Some tables were still getting served and we were still eating. 

They had three servers on our table which was great for check ups! But, they asked if we were finished yet a bit too much. 

It has the potential to be a really great place! The food was tasty. The guac was a bit under falvoured -- it lacked some serious bite and was nothing special. The only issue was really just with the staff. They really wanted us to get out of there so they could close down.

The second time I went, over a year later, we had a better time. The food was really great, however they brought us our main JUST as our appetizer was sat down in front of us. The server/food runner tried to fit it onto our tiny table, which we weren't pleased about. Finally, I said \"Um, I don't think we're ready for our main\" and he took it back. Later, the timing was great once our plates were cleared and our stuff came back nice and hot.

Again, we felt a little bit rushed. I get that it's a busy place and they likely want to get as many sittings as possible, but the vibe of the entire restaurant is something that just screams slow date night, so I wish they wouldn't be so rushed."}
{"text":"I have probably been to this restaurant about 5 times now, so that just goes to show how much I love it here.

If you want some awesome tacos,you need to make your way to Playa Cabana. It's about a 10minute walk from Dupont station, so it's pretty convenient to get to.

Quick take:
- $$
- amazing guac & chips
- delicious tacos
- good portions
- good vibe for a date night
- clearly I will be back here

What I like about this place is that even though they are of the more trendy Mexican restaurant style, their portion sizes are still reasonable. My biggest qualm with a lot of places in the city that serve tacos is that the tacos are too small and too expensive for what you get. Here is not the case. I've ordered their lobster taco on more than one occasion and every time it's a solid 10. They actually give you real and sizable pieces of lobster. Not like other restaurants where when you order seafood anything, they give you like two minuscule pieces which you would need a magnifying glass to see. If you like lobster, get these tacos. They're amazing

Their quac and chips is also a good size appetizer. The guac is fresh and the chips are homemade and perfectly crunchy. The guac comes in a mortar and you can get different levels of spiciness. They also have additional hot sauces you can add at your table which are pretty freakin' hot and I do have a decent spice tolerance. When I come with a friend, we usually get the guac & chips to start and tacos (which come in a set of 3) and by the end of it we're pretty sufficiently stuffed.

I had their sangria once and it was delicious! It's a little expensive by the pitcher but for a glass it is decent and definitely tasty.

Word to the wise, this place is pretty tiny. Tables are pretty close to one another so if you are really big on private dining, this is not the place for you! It also fills up on a weeknight. The times I've gone at night I made reservations and every time as I'm leaving there is a lineup of people. Definitely recommend making a reservation. It's worth it especially in the winter time.

The service here is hit or miss. Sometimes I come here and my water glass is always filled and I've been asked how everything was going, got some good suggestions. Other times, I'm pretty much left to my own devices to ask for things. To me the food is the most important thing depending on the price point and I'm more than willing to come back here (obviously) even if the service is sometimes lackluster. The lobster tacos are that good."}
{"text":"Delicious but pricey and super crowded. Still worth it though. The atmosphere is very charged and fun. I would agree with another poster in that it's the best Mexican food in Toronto. 

Rumour has it the owner takes the staff to Mexico to learn new techniques and improve their craft. Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"oh man I used to really love this place! went there on saturday for a friend's birthday and it was just rude, rushed, and uncomfortable. the waiter's attitude set the tone for the entire meal - seemed irritated when we were ordering, asking him questions (even easy ones, like hey a lot of your drinks sound great, which one would you recommend?), or taking too long (i.e. 5-10 minutes) to look at the menu before ordering our meals/desserts. I know there is a time limit, but that doesn't mean that it should be okay for restaurants to make you FEEL THAT every second of your time there...the waiter was clearly trying to force us to order as fast as possible to have enough time for the next seating. I think I'm done with places with the 'time limit' -especially when the bill ends up being $300 for the 4 of us. We ordered a pitcher of the house margarita. Our appetizers (ceviche and guac) came out hilariously fast - like 2m after ordering - also a gross \"are both of these just sitting in big vats at the back of the restaurant\" feeling. Our pitcher didn't come until we finished the appetizers (lol) even though we ordered it as soon as we go there. Fail. Fail, Playa Cabana. Had a good time because of the friends I was with, but man...everything else almost ruined the night. Luckily, food was good, although we had to slurp down our coffee and cake because were almost out of time. Maybe have longer reservations for groups 4+. Maybe just enough with the timed dinners now that you have a zillion other locations. There are just too many other good restaurants in Toronto to put up with that. Sad times.

BTW - although they're not as hipster or whatever, Mexi-Taco and Rebozos both have equally delicious food without the B.S. My boyfriend is Mexican so I have some cred in this department, lol."}
{"text":"Delicious. All the food was amazing and priced very well and staff were very knowledgable about the menu. Authentic amazing place."}
{"text":"They do a great mexican! Vodka cesar's with Tromba is where it's at - also the spicy guac... Minus points for it always being packed - but i guess that's because it's small..."}
{"text":"Ceviche -yes its 'cooked' with lime juice but half the serving bowl should not be lime juice. 

The tortilla for the tacos al pastor crumbled in my hands -could not have been recently made and the meat was on the dry side. Overall conclusion was that this weekday lunch may not have been the best time to try this place out for the first time."}
{"text":"Russell Peters once said \"There are no Mexicans in Canada.  You should see how messed up our lawns are.\"

I think he should have replaced \"lawns\" with \"Mexican restaurants.\"  

I spent a few years in San Diego, so blah blah blah, yeah, whatever.  This place is truly amazing.  It's expensive, but totally worth it, and a GREAT place to take a date.  Don't take her here TOO much, because she'll likely get fat.  

I should probably quit before I say something offensive.

Seriously, check this place out.  I had a chicken burrito that was smothered in some really delectable orange sauce. It's authentic and upscale.  You'll like it!"}
{"text":"Came here during the weekday for lunch with a coworker and enjoyed it! We sat outside on their patio, it was small but cute! I ordered the pulled beef tostada, the portions were huge and very tasty! We also got mojitos with our meal, it was a bit too sweet for my liking but no big deal. The only thing that surprised me was how expensive it was. My bill came to $37.00 so this place is definitely on the more expensive side."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and only steps away from where I live, which is always a bonus. They are ALWAYS bust so don't bother trying to go without a reservation unless maybe on a weekday around 5. They do allow you to make online reservations, but they're usually pretty booked up for weeks in advance and don't accommodate large groups. Anyway, the food is delicious so I guess it's worth it!

The portion sizes are good (I usually can't finish), which when compared to the too-small and too-costly options at their sister restaurant down the street (Hacienda) is a welcome change! The decor is beautiful and the music gives it a great vibe."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a nice lunch spot after visiting castle Casaloma. We came across this small but cozy authentic Mexican place. They served us house made chips with guacamole as appetizers. The guacamole is served in a molcajete (stone bowl). I thought that was pretty cool!!
For our mains we got fish tacos (Tacos de Pescado) and beef short rib tacos (Ancho Braised Short rib crispy Tacos). They were amazing!!
I would definitely go back to this place on a daily base if I lived in Tdot. Thank you Playa Cabana!! I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! The guac and chips are amazing, as well as the tostadas. Big portions and awesome flavour. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ate there Saturday night and it wasn't good at all.  The host was a complete prick and the food was greasy.  Restaurant was extremely loud and overly packed not to mention the bathrooms are dirty.

Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Small cute patio
Make sure you check with the hostess before you sit down though - she gave us crap for seating ourselves although the waiter guy said sit wherever
Don't get the caipirinha drink - there is no booze
But the entourage is good
Chicken tacos were awesome - deftly recommend them"}
{"text":"The Guaca Feaca- The best spicy guacamole I've ever had! 

Tacos de Pollo Al Carbon -  Not on my A - List. I sent this back because it had little to no taste. The mango in top didn't help much. 

Crispy Chicken Tinga Tacos - Delicious if you love chicken! 

Taco De Pescado - Delicious fish tacos!"}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

Playa Cabana is nestled on a residential street at Davenport and Dupont.  Rumours about not being able to get in without a reservation are definitely true - even at lunch time.

I came here on a Friday afternoon around 1:30PM and the place was packed.  Just when hopes of a table came up, we were told the fellas at the bar had dibs on it.  I can see why because the bar was definitely cramped when it came to leg room in an already small restaurant.  I would say it seats no more than 40 and the servers really have to do a whole dance to maneuver around.

The one good thing that came of sitting at the bar is a full frontal view of the kitchen as well as one of the best bartenders in the city.  He was attentive, entertaining and makes, in my humble opinion, one of the best Mojitos in the city.  While you can opt for the traditional (made with rum) - tequila lovers can rejoice as he offers that as an alternative.

A sign on the wall proudly announces that they make their own soft shell corn tortillas in house - a bragging right that most restaurants cannot herald.

We started off with the Guaca Fresca ($8) which comes in mild, medium or spicy.  We opted for the spicy and didn't find it to be spicy.  The guac itself was rather bland, as were the chips.  A far cry from the lime-salted tortilla chips at Grand Electric.

We also opted to share the Cubeta de Camaron ($16), a 1 lb bucket of shrimp tossed in an Arbol-garlic butter, Cancun style.  These were delicious.  I liked the spices and the shrimp were grilled to a nice pink.

For mains we shared the Tacos de Pescado ($14) and went with the grilled option ($1 more).  All taco dishes come with 3 tacos though you can get 4 to make it more sharable.

I simply couldn't leave without an order of Churros - or could I?  In the case of Playa Cabana, I am disappointed to say I could've skipped dessert. My expectation of an airy Churro rolled in cinnamon sugar was nowhere to be found.  Instead, a nightmare of a hard and overly sweet stick (which was probably re-fried) showed up on my plate.  Suffice it to say that this was one (rare) occasion where I didn't finish dessert.

Our meal came up to about $69 net of tip.  While I really enjoyed the bucket of shrimp and the tacos were delicious and fresh; as a whole Grand Electric is still my favourite joint when I'm in the mood for Mexican.  The weak points of my meal here were definitely the guac and the Churros.

But as the sign above the large communal table read \"Todo chido\" (it's cool).  I'll likely be back to try out their burritos in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but take reservations - yay!  There is a cute alcove in the back where we sat and began our journey at the Playa Cabana.  

From the group, we got a bunch of share plates.  

GUACAMOLE & SALSA - the guac was very fresh and came in those heavy stone bowls.  The Salsa was definitely the winner, it was very flavourful and the right amount of spice.  Very well done.

FISH CEVICHE - this was a pleasant surprise!  It was tangy and citrusy and it cooked the fish just right with the blend of fresh herbs and lime.  

CHORIZO CONQUISTADORES - couldn't even pronounce it, the server was very helpful!  It was all right, the was thin strips of meat in a slab of red sauce, wasn't a huge table fav.

CUBETA DE CAMARON - this was definitely a winner, it was very delicious!  The shrimp were large and juicy!  The shrimp was tossed in a cajun butter sauce and when you sprinkle the lime on it, it is perfection!  Everyone at the table was pleased and the portion was plentiful!

BEEF ENCHILADAS SUIZAS - this was a very large portion which would have been ideal for 2 if you were to share appies.  It was great, it was beef-off-the-bone tender, and the flavours were delicious.  It came with rice, guac and a choice of black or pinto beans.  A great choice!

The service was great, very fast, attentive and took the time to explain everything and check on us to make sure we had everything.  The drink were another winner.  The MARGARITAS are famous there and they come in a pitcher!!!  We got the house Margarita (the first one on the drink menu) and it was so tangy and not too sweet, we shared it amongst 4 ladies and we got pretty tipsy after a few pitchers, at $29 you can definitely have a great time and get affordable drinks.  

The bill after splitting everything was about $50 per person which was mucho affordable.  Must go, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We were driving back from a cottage in Brighton and wanted to pick up food to eat at home. You know, avoid having to make food when we're already so tired? Playa Cabana was on our way and it's one of those spots that we've wanted to try out, but just haven't gotten to.
We popped in and ordered the chicken and pastor (soft) tacos and a horchata for while we waited on our order.
I found the service to be friendly and overall efficient and extremely fast. The food was done before we even got through half the drink. The horchata, while good, was not as great as we've had elsewhere in the city. I found that it was at once refreshing going down the throat but leaving your mouth with a dry feeling (which made you think you were thirsty).
Later when we got home to eat, the shells were coming apart a bit (likely from condensation) but the meat was amazing. The pastor is a bit spicy but delicious and the chicken balanced out the spiciness of our meal.
While there, we discussed how the location was compact which created a sense of intimacy, but it wasn't romantic in the classic sense, making it a great spot for new dates. We will return to dine in someday, and hopefully have a chance to visit the other Playa locations, to be able to compare all of them!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friends and had a blast.The restaurant is small and has a cute outdoor seating area. The food was delicious, fresh and love the selection of hot sauces they had for me. 

We started off with the guac and chips. Guac was great. And we also ordered the bucket of shrimp. That was Delicious!!!!! The shrimps had so much flavor!!! I had the lobster tacos for entree. That was delicious as well. It was bursting with flavor, with a hint of spice, the cheese, tomatoes and guac on the side. Oh man! My friend had the carne asada. The steak was cooked perfectly. Tender and juicy and of course with the sauce on top it was bursting with flavor and a bit spicy. My other friend had the burrito and my husband had the short rib tacos. Alll were super delicious. 

The service we received were great. Our waitress was very personable and friendly and her recommendations were great. 

I would definitely love to come back here the next time I come to Toronto again."}
{"text":"Terrible service and horrible food. I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and the meat was served dry and burnt. It looked and tasted like it had been made previously and refried before serving it to me. 

I love Tequila and all throughout Toronto I felt that the pours have been small. I can understand this due to the cost of importing it. I am willing to pay more to have it and it really upsets me when I would like to give a restaurant my money and I can not receive any service. It also upsets me when I order a drink, never receive it but it ends up on my final bill. And when I politely dispute the incorrect charge it really bums me out when the server argues the point with me. All of the above occurred at Playa Cabana. It was kinda like getting kicked when I was already down.

As you see from my reviews, I sparingly give a 1 star review. It was an upsetting offensive dining experience. Avoid at all cost if you are a lover of Mexican food and Tequila."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie - have never been the biggest fan of Mexican food. That being said, had a very good experience here. I think what stands out the most is really the atmosphere of the place - very European feel. A real pleasure to go to.

Food was 7/10. Had the beef flutes, civiche, guacamole, salsa, and fish tacos. Overall, very well prepared, but the tastes weren't 100% to my liking, again, possibly biased haha.

Anyways, the group was very happy with the meal, and the Sangria was pretty good (ask for less ice). Parking isn't too hard to find by the way, but you should expect to look on the streets. I'd say it's a great date place as well."}
{"text":"Everyone was silent when the food was served since they were so good. I had lobster taco and would definitely go back for that. We made a reservation so didn't need to wait in the line. It's a cozy (tiny) restaurant"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana has brought to Toronto some much needed delicious Mexican food. My dinner dates and I started off by sharing the salsa, guacamole and chips. The guacamole and salsa were perfectly delicious - the right amount of sweet and spicy, and the guacamole was a bit chunky and fresh - just the way I like it! The tortilla chips were a bit oily but still delicious and worth the grease - at least I could tell they were made fresh!

Next up we had the Mexican street corn. This was my first time trying MSC and oh my goodness, was it delicious!! And they somehow make it so that you don't get all messy while eating this finger food. I'll definitely be back for more corn!

I then ordered the vegetarian enchiladas which were divine. The enchiladas have both regular salsa and salsa verde, giving you the best of both worlds. The corn tortillas were fragrant and flavourful and the mushrooms inside the enchiladas were so succulent and perfect. This meal was amazing and a large portion too!

We ended it off with the cake (I can't remember the name). I seriously cannot believe I had room for a few bites after all the food I ate but boy am I happy I was able to enjoy a couple bites of this moist, deliciously rich cake.

Overall, our service was wonderful and the vibe of the restaurant was great!

I can't wait to return to Playa Cabana!"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana is a pretty small restaurant, so I made a reservation for 2 for 7pm on a Wednesday night - we were seated immediately, and there were still a few other tables free around us. The place started to get quite busy at around 8, so it's definitely worth making a reservation especially if you're going with as a party larger than 2.

Even though it can feel a bit cramped, the service and food were good. I got the baja fish tacos (comes in a set of 3) - the fish was really good, but I feel like it could have used a bit more guac/sauce around the sides, as it sometimes tasted a bit bland. I wasn't full after the 3 tacos, but generally have a pretty big appetite! 

Overall, I still enjoyed my time, but am not sure if I would return at this price point."}
{"text":"Took a date here yesterday evening for dinner, and was wowed by the food (I had the lobster tacos; she had the fish tacos). It only took a bite or two before we both said that we'd be back soon. 

We started off with a fish of the day ceviche (it was served in what looked like a stone pestle) with fresh chips, and it was phenomenal, one of the best and freshest I've had. I've had many a poor ceviche (marinated till it's gloopy mush). The ceviche here, however, was fresh, vibrant, and just the right amount of tart. My mouth's watering writing about it. The entrees were equally impressive: homemade taco shells and fresh stuffings. And our waiter called us \"amigos.\" Very friendly staff.

The place was a little cramped, and we were seated at a tiny two-seater table, but honestly they could sit me on the sidewalk and serve me their food and I'd be happy as a clam. Will be back."}
{"text":"Every taco we had was amazing. The churros we so good we had dessert twice!! Although it gets busy the patio is great for a summer time afternoon brunch. To me playa cabana is the top Mexican restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"I visited PC on my weekend vaca to Toronto from Chicago. I hate to say anything bad about a restaurant, but the food was not very good:(

I started with guacamole and chips (which was pretty good actually) then I had the fish tacos at the recommendation of my waitress. Unfortunately they were bland and didn't have good favor at all. I asked for the short rib tacos instead. Those were also bland with no flavor:(

I ended up leaving (still hungry). In PC's defense, I live in Chicago and we have Amazing Mexican food so perhaps it was a high bar I was measuring them against. 

PS. The staff was really friendly and they had decent drinks, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Adoro el lugar!

The first time I tried to go to this place, was one Friday night. i didn't have reservation and the waiting time was two hours...

This time, we made reservation a couple of hours before, and went there on a Thursday. What we didn't know, is that they have two locations really close of each other. So, we ended up walking back to Playa Cabana.

I liked the decoration and the patio. They have a trendy, modern, mexican-cantina vibe. Which was reflected in that delicious \"paloma\" I drank. It hasn't been common for me to find this drink abroad. Never thought I would find it in the perfect proportion of authentic ingredients. This paloma, was the best cocktail appetizer I had this year.

We ordered:

GUACA FRESCA
HOMEMADE CHIPS AND FRESH SALSA
TACOS DE PULPO
TACOS DE POLLO AL CARBON
TACOS AL PASTOR
TACOS DE LANGOSTA
Palomas, tequila, and beer!!!

It was really cool that they serve the salsa and the guacamole on the \"molcajetes\". The guacamole had too much lime for my taste, but the salsa was perfect.

My favorite item was: tacos de pulpo. A shame they treat them like appetizers, because they would be awesome like main course. The flavor hypnotized me, but they were only two, too small and with just one tortilla. I wanted to order more, but I was afraid it was going to be too much.

The tacos de langosta where the ones I didn't like much. Too greasy, messy and blah. The hardshell tastes like a bunuelo (fried bread), not like tortilla. You can't hold them, cut them or bite them in peace. They had enough lobster, but they lacked flavor.

The quality and flavor of my other options was great. I recommend them."}
{"text":"To the reviewer here who wrote: \"...I think they should set aside a few tables, at least, to accommodate those who didn't make reservations...\", they only have a few tables!
Go back to California and make a reservation at your chain restaurant.
This was my first experience here and very positive, regardless of the rain and the fact that we had to move inside. We were 6 for lunch and the service was friendly. It's a small place so expect the coziness and loudness. Food is very good and the potent Margarita's are quite delish! Will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Didn't see what the hype was about.  It was decent but not amazing. One taco I got was super greasy. And the Dulce Leche cake was dryer than it should have been"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with delicious food and a great atmosphere. It's a great go-to spot that my boyfriend and I love!  The Short Rib tacos are amazing and the guacamole is out of this world! 

Definitely my favourite Mexican restaurant in the city!!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos.  They were lightly battered and then deep fried, and sat well in your stomach as well.  And you also got 3 of them.

The guac and chips came in a large portion, shareable between two or three people as well, and well salted.  

The drinks were a bit expensive, so I opted for a $6 corona.  

It's not a place to have a quiet meal, but the vibe of it is quite fun."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spin on Mexican food, this is the place! Hidden gem , would highly recommend. The only downside to my experience here is the location, it is EXTREMELY tight. I am not usually one to complain for small intimate restaurants, but this place is just too small for comfort."}
{"text":"Once again, great food and great atmosphere, love the presentation and selection.
Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Good authentic Mexican food and nice atmosphere (though a little cramped). Had the choriqueso tacos, the meat was well seasoned and cooked right, the cheese was queso Oaxaca, you can't usually find that here and when you do it's often not good but not in this case. Service was prompt, it's a small place but they had plenty of people on staff. Would definitely dine here again. 

By the way, I'm Mexican so believe me when I say it's authentic."}
{"text":"A house-turned restaurant, Playa Cabana is tucked away on a quiet part of Dupont. Dim lighting and rustic-y decor make for a a nice ambiance. If you're in this part of town and you like guacamole, definitely check it out. The kitchen staff was 100% Latino. This is always a good sign. My personal experience, however, was just OK (mostly relating to the service provided). 

We ordered a pitcher of mojitos for the table which arrived in the form of margaritas. When we politely told the server that he had mixed up our order, he insisted that we had in fact ordered margaritas. Strike one. But ok, he brought us the mojitos at no extra charge.

The food was good, but a few things were missing. The carne asada is a (surprisingly) large slab of meat which should have been the first clue that it was mostly globs of fat and very little actual meat. The sauce was delicious, as were the pureed black beans, but someone should be inspecting the cuts of meat for quality before serving them for $19 a piece. The guacamole was perfect.

Finally, the bill arrived and there were a few curiously inserted charges for things that we had not ordered (including 2 side salads and a portion of rice). This is apparently what happens when your server says: \"would you like rice or salad with that?\" and you assume that your meal comes with rice or salad when in fact it does not. This is one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants - why trick the customer into ordering something that she did not ask for? We're going to see it on the bill! I was not impressed with that.

Lastly, I will say that despite my somewhat average experience here, its a great place to get drinks and to munch on some guac on an otherwise uneventful Tuesday night. Playa Cabana seems to always be busy in this very quiet and unassuming part of town.

I should add one more thing: after about an hour of great salsa tunes followed by some reggaeton, someone decided it was a good idea to play \"Backstreets Back\" and other  90's pop jams. We were all confused by that and it was truly unfortunate."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful service! I would say the cramped seating is the main downside. Also wouldn't recommend for deep conversation due to loudness but I feel that is expected in any place open til 11."}
{"text":"I've been to all of the locations, this is the original and the BEST location. Resos are a must here, it's a tight space. Fish tacos and Pastor are the way to go!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny little Mexican restaurant that opened three weeks ago. Nestled in the Annex's residential area, this place serves up what looks like some pretty authentic Mexican dishes. The food was good in a wholesome and filling way.  I had a chorizo appetizer and a burrito that has an egg on it.  The burrito entree was huge and impossible to finish. My companion had the seafood special (served with rice which we agreed to be far better than the burrito...that should say a lot as the burrito was splendid). The menu is several pages long and there are plentiful options for meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. 
The margaritas, especially the ones made with agave nectar, were delicious. 

Those agave margarita pitchers are really quite smashing. The nectar makes the margarita slightly sweeter without being overwhelmingly saccharine.

All in all, a cute little place with great food and amazing margarita pitchers."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to place in Toronto.
Excellent food and good atmosphere! 
You will probably walk by this place not even noticing or thinking who goes here to eat but as they say don't judge a book by its cover! Inside is cozy and has a nice ambiance! 
Very pleasant and helpful staff! 
Went for lunch and had fish taco(soft) and rib taco(hard)! Very good specially the rib taco! 
The guacamole is from another universe! 
Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets, indeed! Seriously the best Mexican food I've had since moving to Toronto, hands down. At Playa Cabana, you're not going to find greasy cheese-soaked Tex-Mex garbage. This, folks, is the real deal -- and I say that as someone who was raised in Southern California, and spent time living just a short drive from the Baja border.

Husband and I strolled in one evening and were lucky to get a table. We split the ceviche, which was fresh and spicy. The enchiladas I ordered as a main were stuffed with super tender chicken and zingy red and green sauces. Also a huge plus: they have Mexican Coke! (Not the yayo kind, the drinkable kind in glass bottles and not sweetened with real sugar and not high-fructose corn syrup). 

I wish I'd saved room for dessert! Playa Cabana has a great boozy menu, a good selection of tequilas, and the people that work there are awesome. The only downside is that the place is super small, so the next time I go I'll try to make reservations. But it's not going to be long 'till I go back. Playa Cabana is seriously delicioso!"}
{"text":"So so yummy!!! Love their chips, guacamole, salsa. It's small but super cute. I had the lobster tacos. Omg heavenly!! Wish this place was close to my house Instead of in a different country!"}
{"text":"Big portion sizes at a not-so-bad price! Their in-house made chips and salsa are delicious. I'm not the most well-versed in all things Mexican, but this place comes off quite authentic - from when you first step over the threshold of what used to be a house to this small, intimate restaurant with Mexican music playing. They even had the heat turned up because my glasses fogged up as soon as I came in from the brisk March air. I'd definitely come back or at least check out their other location at DuPont and Avenue which is closer to the Yonge subway line."}
{"text":"I know I'm not Mexican, but I've had a hell of a lot of great Mexican food. If you want proof, check my profile. 
This place is less than mediocre. I was very disappointed. 
Starting with the drinks, they can't make a margarita to save their life. I do a better job at home. Tasted awful. 
The nachos were horrible, tasted like some fried up Tori's or something like that. 
I had the Carne Asada and my wife had the fish tacos. The good was again, less than mediocre. The guacamole tasted like it came from a can, wasn't great at all. 
The flan, tasted so bad. I have no words to describe it. 

Don't plan to go to this place again."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana never disappoints.  Portions and flavors are large here. Favourite place for burritos and drinks!"}
{"text":"The original PC chain - loud and squishy but it ads to the vibe of the place. Food is awesome - personal fav are the crispy brisket tacos and fried fish tacos. There are some great cocktails at this location that they don't have at the other PC outposts. Because it is such a small resto it can be hard to get into so definitely make a reservation to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Food was great, loved my fish taco and chips with salsa, service was nice. Only downsize is that it quite small that I'd imagined."}
{"text":"Great mexican place! I've been there a few times, loved it each time. Very good tacos. A bit greasy, but well it's Mexican :)

I live right in the area and i'll definitely go back more often during the summer!"}
{"text":"Took my BF here for his birthday, made a reservation two weeks in advance.

We were a bit late for our reservation which made me nervous we would lose the table. When we arrived the hostess seated us at the most awkwardly placed table in the restaurant (IMO) which caused us to have to sit side by side not to get constantly bumped into being in the middle of the aisle. This place is tiny! 

After about 15 minutes of awkwardness, we were eventually moved to a more sensibly located table which had been empty ever since we arrived. Thanks!!

Not deflated and just wanting to enjoy ourselves, we ordered a couple of fancy drinks, including mojitos and the Paloma (?). Well made and strong! Woot!

Our starter was the spicy peel and eat shrimps - so messy but sooooo good! My BF got the beef braised tacos which were very awesome, I recommend anyone try these!

For our mains, my boyfriend ordered the steak and I got the chill relleno (I always have to order this at any Mexican restaurant, it is my fave!). Unfortunately his steak came out much more rare than he wanted (he ordered medium rare and got rare). The waitress was super nice about taking it back but he was just turned off at it and shared my main with me. She ended up comping us a dessert for the trouble and taking the steak off the bill, which was nice.  

We actually ordered both desserts to try (after all it was his berfday!), the churros and the tres leches cake. I loved both of them but the cake was something out of this world. It was seriously one of the best desserts I have ever had and hands down the best tres leeches for sure.

By the end of our visit, it seemed some heavily intoxicated people had piled into the restaurant and the noise level increased substantially. The woman behind me kept knocking into my chair and it was a bit uncomfortable. We just wanted to roll our stuffed selves out of there at that point.

I enjoyed the food but have to say did not love the ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Mexican food. But the fish tacos came in a soft wrap. Not sure how I was supposed to eat it. Service was pretty good. Avoid sitting at the bar closest to the kitchen, it gets really hot."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem, and is actually a special destination for us given that it isn't in our neighborhood. If you're considering going, I have one word for you: go.

It gets very packed, even late at night (I think their kitchen closes at 11 on weeknights), but it's worth the fifteen minute wait at the door.

I've never traveled to Mexico, so I can't give you an opinion on the authenticity of the food. What I can tell you is that everything they serve is fresh and delicious. You can basically point at the menu at random and be satisfied with what comes to your table.

The place is boisterous and lovely, with a lot of life. The service is attentive and great. And the cocktails... (again, refer to the random pointing at the menu technique).

WORDS OF WARNING: Now, I'm a fan of spicy heat. But I was stupid enough to go b-deep into a hot paste that was on the table. Call me stupid or call me cocky; whatever. But I was dying, left gargling a glass of cold milk for a half an hour. ...stupid.

TL;DR Great value, great food, great service. Watch out for the habanero paste in the jar unless you're cooler than me."}
{"text":"We had very high expectations about this restaurant. Me and my hubby are Mexicans, lived in Toronto for many years always looking for a Mexican restaurant that can take us back home in our full five senses. We've heard incredible things about playa cabana from our Mexicans friend and from our none Mexican friends, we've also been in \"hacienda playa cabana\" which is one block away from this restaurant and from 
the same owner and we really really like hacienda. 

Anyways, here is why 3 stars. 

We sat in a corner inside, the inside was pretty empty everyone was seating in the patio (30* degrees outside) we were biking so it was too hot for us, starting with the service, it wasn't bad, although I thought specially because it wasn't really full there was going to be more special attention, the service isn't knocking stars, the service was fine. 
We ordered a few items tacos de carnitas, tacos al pastor, short ribs tacos, elotes, agua de jamaica and guacamole. 

Guacamole- home-made with the choice of mild medium or hot, with home made chips, the guac was great.

Agua de jamaica - it was extremely sweet and from the dark red color and the really sweet taste we knew it was fake jamaica (the syrup comes in a bottle and you just add water) that was a downer, we didn't like it.

Elotes- the elotes were amazing 5 stars for sure, a little spice with cheese and the crema and mayo. We both enjoyed this a lot.

All the tacos took a long time, like a looong time.

Tacos de pastor- this were not pastor, they didn't look like pastor or tasted pastor, the meat was thick and lacked flavour, we didn't like them.

Tacos de carnitas- to me they were ok nothing great, came with some chicharrón (deep fried crispy pork meat) I'm not a chicharrón fan, and also the tacos had lots of topping, onion jalapeños etc but I wanted meat, I wanted carnitas, if you are gonna charge about $5 per taco, they have to be full tacos (that's why I love seven lives). My hubby liked this ones, he wasn't crazy about it but he enjoyed them.

Short ribs tacos - in My opinion this were the better ones, I like the hacienda playa cabana better but I liked them.

For dessert we had  churros con cajeta and flan 

The churros - were really well done almost burnt with not much cajeta...  It was ok but man, churros, you have to give me more cajeta! 

Flan - do not order the flan, I don't know what was this, I know what flan is and how it looks like and how it tastes like, and I love flan! This is not flan, it was hard, like really hard almost like trying to scoop hard ice-cream...mexican flan it's soft, almost like Jello.. We couldn't eat it, it also had a funny taste.. Sorry playa but this \"flan\" of yours sucks  ): 

Overall... I don't think we are coming back, we will for sure go to -hacienda- but not here, if we were ever coming back, it would only be for the elotes."}
{"text":"Very tasty mexican food!!!
The people in the kitchen really care about quality.  Everything we had was super fresh and it felt like it was all made special for us = )

Highly recommended.   Small place and not many seats, so goodluck finding a table"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - I love coming here with my friends and sharing guacamole with a variety of tacos.  Last time I came, I ordered the fish taco (fried) and pork sausage with roasted pineapple taco.  Loved the fish taco (meaty and flaky), but felt the pork sausage was overly salty, though the pineapples were a nice touch.

Pricing seems reasonable (3 tacos starting at $15). I thought the cocktails were overpriced ($13 and up), and did not order any."}
{"text":"Walked in between the lunch time & dinner time rush and immediately got seated at our table. While the place is quite cramped, it had that semi-cozy & loud cantina feel that I felt for a minute that I was in a busy cantina somewhere in Mexico!

We ordered a pitcher of the \"amber\" margarita, crab cakes, chicken tinga tostadas, grilled fish tacos and the tres leches cake.

The crab cakes were on the small side, yet really appetizing that led  us to crave for more of what's to come. Both the chicken tinga tostadas (2 pcs) and the grilled fish tacos (3 pcs) were really really fresh and tasty. I also liked their variation of chili sauces on the table (chopped fresh chilies, chili chipotle, red and green sauces), and yes they were indeed HOT - which were perfect to complement any dish you order. The highlight of the meal was the amazing tres leches cake - satisfyingly moist, decadent, and refreshing all at the same time!

Overall, the food looked like they were not much portion-wise, but don't let that deceive you. 

They have an amazingly tasty and authentic food with great ambience, it'll make you forget you're stil in the city!"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana
Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Mexican
Menu items: Tacos de Pulpo, Tacos de Choriqueso, Tacos al Pastor & Churros

Playa Cabana's best kept secret is not its decor, a menu item or even a specialty tequila...their secret has a name, and that name is Mireya.

Mireya is the master-mind behind most concoctions at Playa Cabana. Her experience in Mexican cuisine roots from her own roots bringing to Toronto's Mexican food lovers some of the most tasting and authentic recipes.

I came to know of Playa Cabana through word of mouth. Having opened over a year ago, I was perplexed to have just heard about this place. Maybe my journalism know-how needs some polishing, or maybe its popularity just recently increased with the overwhelming opening of taco joints this year in Toronto, such as La Carnita. Either way, I was, and still am, extremely happy to have visited Playa Cabana and especially, to have tasted Mireya's precious treats.

Speaking of treats, why not start by describing the insanely-good Pulpo Tacos.
Pulpo means \"octopus\" in Spanish. The Octo-Taco, as Playa Cabana calls is it, is served with the full octopus tentacle, perfectly seasoned and cooked, with a rather smooth texture and is served on a bed of charred jalapeno salsa. But that is not all that comes with it, there is also visible pieces of corn, a small drop of guacamole and what looked like a grilled cherry tomato drizzled with cilantro. Though the Chef was not able to share the ingredients with me, I could very easily understand why - these tacos are unique and so are the recipes.

The freshly-made corn tortillas are something worth a mention as they are made on the premises with corn and water. The \"tortillera\", meaning the woman that makes the tortillas (not Mireya), has her own station at the back of the restaurant, where she smiles as guests pass by while she makes what looks like thousands of tortillas in one night.

Asides from the tortillas, all salsas are also made fresh, with ingredients that never come from a can or bottle, and are locally sourced.

Like the Tacos de Chori-Queso, a homemade Mexican chorizo wrapped with Oaxaca cheese, griddle in corn tortillas. The sauce is subtle and is mostly mixed with the juice goodness flowing from the chorizo. This taco drips with flavour and punch and has a nice crunchy texture.

The famous Tacos al Pastor, which are Mexico's staple taco, are my favourite and apparently a crowd favorite at Playa Cabana. Pastor tacos are adobo-marinated pork roasted on a Trompo (spit) with pineapple. Adobo is mostly known as a way of seasoning meat to preserve it. Usually made out of paprika, oregano, salt, pepper and vinegar, adobo ensures the meat flavour is locked in while the meat rotates on the spit. Playa Cabana's version of adobo is slightly different, adding a bit of chili pepper flavour, and of course pineapple, with a Mexican je ne sais quoi. The tacos are served on soft tortillas topped with diced red onion and cilantro and packed with the marinated pork which is succulent and tender...the star of the dish.

On the sweet side of things, Playa Cabana's churros where delectably served with a home-made dulce de leche, topped with whipped cream and cinnamon powder.

The ducle de leche, also known as caramel made with goats milk, tasted instinctively fresh. It was as though I was savouring a slightly sweet goats milk, so good. The churro was crunchy, but a bit too chewy, almost undercooked on the inside. I am not certain if that was the intention, but it definitely felt like it. 

Mireya's keen affinity for flavour, texture and tradition has made Playa Cabana one of my favourite Mexican restaurants in the city. Wherever she goes, I will go.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome! The atmosphere and design are spot on. Staff is super friendly and accommodating, and the food is absolutely delicious! If you haven't been I highly recommend their guacamole and chips, short-rib tacos, and fried fish tacos. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My Original 3.5 Star review is below - but it is high time I revised.  My husband, yep no longer the BF he was below, and I are at Playa fairly regularly after buying a house up the street.  I have found my love for it and never had a negative experience since our first visit.  Food remains excellent, crowd fun and we always sneak a seat at the bar rather than deal with the clunky tables.  My new go to orders are the Salad with Pork - Yum and the Michilatas(Sp) - also never miss the Guac and the Spicy Mole...go and enjoy and Yeah Playa for being such a great place in our hood.


OLD REVIEW....for context
I am breaking with the crowd a bit - but bear with me.  This is a 3.5 (a strong one...and worth trying...but still not top rated)

Food is really good, really fresh and authentic.  Definitely a step up from the Mexican places in T.O. that I have tried in the past.  I loved the guacamole and the spicy chicken mole was unbelievable.  We waited a few weeks to get a dinner reservation and in the end decided to try for brunch instead.  I would love to go back for dinner, but they do book in advance.  And we are fun and all, but don't normally have margaritas at brunch, so will have to take the word of other reviews about how amazing they are. 

The crowd was neighbourhood and foodie visitors to the neighbourhood - nice and friendly vibe - crammed in like sardines so that helps!

So why 3.5?
1. the space is awkward / tables are too big and place does not seem that clean to me.  They could fit way more people in if they changed the entry and got better tables...
2. there was grit in our fish taco, so much that my bf thought he had broken his tooth
3. Our service was VERY SLOW - not cool for brunch!

We will be back, because I need to try the Margarita and I am a guac addict...and we live a few blocks away..."}
{"text":"What you would expect from a mexican restaurant in this coty - good guac and fresh fish tacos. The ambiance is really cute and cozy, the staff was also very welcoming and kind. 
Its small -they keep it packed."}
{"text":"It's a very hidden place on Dupont street. It looks like a random quite house from the outside, but when you entered, it turns a very busy pub. I ordered the burrito and I like it! It's full of juicy, good quality beef, black beans, and rice. I've never seen any burrito would give me that much beef though! And they drizzled two different sauces, gives the burrito two totally different taste. Very entertaining!"}
{"text":"I eat burritos like they're candy.
So to have a burrito placed in front of me that was so exquisitely sculpted, dressed, topped and stuffed - it would have felt like a crime to inhale it. I savoured every bite of the Carne Molida Picadillo burrito. Even the margarita I had was fresh and delicious. And looking around the table, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with whatever you order.

The atmosphere, music, and servers all feel VERY authentically Mexican - and their amazing homemade salsa took me right back to every vacation I've ever taken down there."}
{"text":"In terms of success I guess the Mas Playa group of restaurants has its footing deep into Toronto's Mexican food trend obsession, growing from this Dupont Street location to several others around the city centre.

A bit hidden off and a tad pricey for something that is essentially Mexican street foods, Playa Cabana is small, cramped, dark, lively... and zesty. Food-wise it is fresh as it get here in the cold gloomy north; quality comparable to some of the Mexican stuff I recall dabbling in whilst in Los Angeles (though I am certainly no authority of \"authentic\" Mexican food at all). But damn they big! Flavours and textures were bursting as we bit into our overstuffed (maybe way too overstuffed) tacos and tuna ceviche. Good grilled flavour in the chorizo in my taco. Fresh guac all around too.

Of all the noise I hear about how crowded it gets at dinnertime, try coming in at lunch instead.
Of all the noise I hear about on-and-off service, my experience with the servers were generally positive and friendly.

{TTC: a short couple blocks walk from Dupont subway station. The Bay and Dupont buses also serve the area, but bus service here really stinks.}"}
{"text":"Very good customer service, taste real Mexican food one of the best Mexican restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. This place isn't that big so I understand why there are line ups.  My hubby and I arrived in between lunch and dinner so we came at a good time.  Their portions are generous and it feels and tastes like authentic mexican food.  Packed full of flavour.  The meat pork in the playa burrito was divine and my tacos were juicy yet crispy from the shells.  I will go back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We made a reservation 5 days in advance to celebrate my sister's birthday. When we got to the restaurant, they said our table would be ready soon. But 25 minutes later, they informed us they couldn't seat us but that we could go to their sister restaurant a couple of blocks away. We chose to leave and try to find other option. There are too many amazing restaurants in  Toronto to waste our time at this place. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"small place in a nice neighbour hood make sure to make reservations before going they don't have enough space specially if you want to sit in side, must try the chips and guacamole and burrito and be careful with the chillies they have on they table extremely hot."}
{"text":"Not bad Mexican in a town without much good.  Had the carne asada which was flavorful, but my standards for this cuisine are ridiculously high, given that I used to live in SoCal.  A few negatives.  1.  I like bachata, but you gotta keep it real, gimme brass in a Mexican restaurant, not Dominican blues music.  2.  Chips and salsa should always be free and be refilled if necessary, this is the Mexican way.  3.  Service was a tad slow, which would have been fine if they kept refilling our chips like they do at every Mexican restaurant I know in the American southwest and Mexico.  All that being said, I recommend the place.  The steak actually had flavors that reminded me of Mexico, a mean feat in Toronto, where few Mexicans live."}
{"text":"I loved the food and drinks! But was a little disappointed about a few things. First off, I made a reservation a week ago just for two people. When we got there, the patio was full (no surprise there) and then there was a short line up inside. When I told the hostess I had a reservation she said she has two spots at the bar for us. I was a little shocked because why in the world would you put a reservation at two tiny spots at the bar? I asked if there were any other tables and she just said no. Fine, we ate our food and drinks at this tiny spot at the bar squished with other people. Thank god the bartender was amazing and friendly. then when we ordered a pitcher, we wanted to finish our drinks on the patio. I asked the hostess if there were any tables and she said no but when something opens up she will let us know. finally she told me we got a table outside. when i went she said oh it was raining so a few tables are wet...do you still want to sit here. I was like uhhh what. then she said she can get us a table inside. Seriously, i just wanted to finish our drinks outside without all the confusion. the hostess made us pay our tab and when i got outside there wasnt actually a table. beside this horrible experience with clearly an unexperienced hostess, the food and atmosphere was great. Will definitely try the other locations!"}
{"text":"Great little place, came here on a Sunday afternoon.  Not a lot of seating.  Started with a bottle of Sol, my friend had a margarita, which she said was excellent.  Nachos and salsa for starters, both made on site and both excellent.  I had chicken enchiladas, with black bean curd and rice, my friend had Octopus tacos (yep!).  Both were excellent.  Highly recommend this place, only drawback is lack of seating, which makes coming here on the fly a bit risky."}
{"text":"Pros: - scrumptious guacamole!!! - excellent service by Hally our waitress - nice atmosphere - nice music -good food for the most part - pricing mostly reasonable - bean/corn lettuce salad was refreshing - carne asada was tasty but too spicy, octopus tacos were tasty. 

Cons: - seating way too tight, table for 2 is literally like a sardine box! No where to put our plates of food, water... seating was a real nuisance for us! - chorizo app was too salty and super spicy, drenched with sauce - pinto beans were too dry - I asked if I can have a \"naked\" taco with rice instead of the taco shell, they refused saying they couldn't offer me that. That's odd, considering they have rice on their menu."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the BEST Mexican food I've ever had.

My boyfriend and I dined at this little gem on a Saturday night.  I was able to make reservations the night before, however, there were very few time slots left, so I recommend making a reservation at least a few days in advance.  It is quite small, so I don't think you'd be able to get a table without a reservation.

We ordered guaca fresco (medium spice) and chorizos conquistadores to start.  The guacamole tasted really fresh; you can definitely tell it is made to order.  The chips were perfectly salted and there was just the right amount to go along with the guacamole.

The chorizo was AMAZING!  It was cooked perfectly and the sauce (simmered red wine and beer) complimented the meat so well.  Perfect portion for an appetizer (although I definitely could have eaten more!).

I ordered the chicken enchilada for my main meal.  This dish comes with two chicken enchiladas (chicken folded in corn tortillas and served with salsas verde/roja), re-fried beans (choice of black or pinto) and rice.  The enchiladas are a generous size and tasted great with the two salsas.  The re-friend beans were delicious and the rice - OMG!  I know it's just rice, but it might just be the most flavourful rice I've ever eaten.  Full disclosure: I couldn't finish the meal - but not because I didn't LOVE it - there was just so much food!

My boyfriend had the braised beef tacos, which I tried, and of course, loved!  The meat was so flavourful and the tacos held together so well (which is rare - hard taco shells tend to break apart when you eat them).  His dish came with three tacos with the option to add re-friend beans and rice (which he opted for).

I also ordered a margarita (a must when dining at a Mexican restaurant!).  It was a little different from your standard margarita, as it had blueberries and raspberries, but it was delicious and refreshing (and they definitely don't skimp on the alcohol!).

Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu (he did a great job of explaining the different types of margaritas).  The service was quick. And the prices were very reasonable! 

I will, undoubtedly, return to this restaurant in the near future.  A must try if you're a fan of Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place.... Soo good! Fresh foods ... Spicy with lots of flavour! Great customer
service. Tiny place but so much character."}
{"text":"Loved this place 

A friend and I randomly discovered this place and we couldn't have been happier with Playa Cabana. The ambiance was great, it felt very authentic and rusty, the food was phenomenal! I had the fish tacos and I don't know if it was because I was hungry but they were perfect! 

The customer service was also really good, very friendly and welcoming so that was really nice for a change. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had a mad craving for tacos one day, so I took a detour on my way home from work and stopped in for some Mexican fare. 

Obviously, I'm not Mexican and I have actually never even been to Mexico, so I'm definitely not qualified to speak about the authenticity of the food here, but I most certainly can comment on the flavours and presentation of the food. My opinion is WOW... just Wow. Seriously delicious food. I had the octopus tacos, guacamole with chips and finished off with crab cakes. I also had a beer, but in hindsight I should've had a margarita instead. They looked delicious! 

I tried a few different hot sauces, and boy, were they good! A couple were a bit too hot for me, but I enjoyed trying them. I put a couple of drops of each one onto the guacamole as I devoured it, so I could see which one I liked best. 

The octopus tacos were perfection. I should've ordered double and skipped the crab cakes, as they were not as enjoyable for me. The guacamole was fantastic and I loved the house made chips. 

Service was exceptional. I sat at the bar on my own and everyone was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome. Oftentimes, when dining solo, I feel a bit out of place or ignored. Not the case here. It seemed that the staff really went out of their way to make me feel at ease and ensure that I had a good experience. What a difference this makes in a dining experience. 

Can't wait to go back for more tacos!!"}
{"text":"This place is happening!  The atmosphere is energetic and the decor is great. 

We had a couple of baskets of nachos and salsa to share.  Both were great.  I had the burrito which was a lot spicier than I had expected.  It turned out to be one of the sauces that was put on it which I wish I had known previously b/c I don't like spice.  Other than the heat though, it was really good.

I liked how you could have a bunch of different types of tacos - I find it hard to choose sometimes, so the tapas style tacos with really unique combinations were a great idea. 

The churros were the best part. 

If you're thinking of coming, I suggest you make a reservation, and get there in advance of it.  We came for a friend's birthday, and although we made a reservation, when we got there they didn't have a table for us.  We ended up having to stand at the bar for 15 mins or so.  They were very apologetic, and worked quickly to get us a table, but it was still a bit disappointing, especially because they didn't offer a free basket of nachos or anything."}
{"text":"Oh lord. What can I say about Playa Cabana? How do you solve a problem like Playa Cabana? At first visit, I would have given Playa Cabana a solid 5 star review. Given the BS they put me through for the second visit, I'm going to bring that down to a 3 star rating. If I could do 2.5 stars, I would. 

My first visit to Playa Cabana was glorious - tasty and sooo much fun! Went with a group of girls for a birthday and we had a blast. Awesome tacos, extraordinary margaritas (amber agave, yummmm), energy, atmosphere and fun. We loved it! I immediately started making plans to come back with a larger group.

Went all out for the 2nd visit! Party of 26. Worked with the management over the course of a few weeks to set up a prix fixe menu for our party. I was super excited about this dinner, but unfortunately, the management (Evan) screwed up pretty much everything. Evan made our reservation for the wrong time, so 26 people stood around for half an hour in the entrance. On the day of the dinner, mere hours before, Evan decided to change the pricing on the prix fixe menu, as well as the overall terms of the prix fixe!! Agreed to separate cheques over email, took it back day of the event. Basically, he agreed to everything up front, over email, in writing, then changed every single last term day of the event. Argued every little thing with me, at length - argued for 20 minutes over $1.22 per person! Seriously not cool! I don't like being messed with, and I don't need all the BS. It was sooo shady, really total crap!! 

That said, even with all this garbage going on, the truth is that every last one of my 25 guests agreed that the food was incredible, the margaritas were amazing, and they would all come back in a heartbeat. Everyone had a great time, everyone loved the place. So basically, there you go. Go to Playa Cabana, you will love it. Just don't take 26 people with you, and don't try and organize a prixfixe menu, and and be sure to double check your reservation time. Do not rely on the management for anything, they have no idea what they are doing. Just go and have a good time. Drink lots of tequila and you won't notice how poor the management is. This is still the best Mexican food I've found in Toronto, and I'm from California. :)

Enjoy! Just don't say I didn't warn you. :) And don't forget - amber agave margaritas. Yum yum yum. :)"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sat night with no reservations and got a seat quickly at the bar. This place is pretty small so it's recommended that you make a reservation. They do have walk-ins for the bar, but the seating isn't very comfortable.

Ambience: Reminded me of an authentic Mexican dive. They played Mexican music throughout the night. 

Bartender: He was super nice and told us that each drink had 2.5 shots of hard liquor in it - definitely worth it! 

Food:

Guaca Fresca: This guac was definitely better than the one we had at Barrio Coreano (one of their sister restaurants). You can pick the spice level and it's served in a cool molcajete. 4/5

Tacos De Pulpo: Grilled octopus tacos. There were only a few pieces of octopus and the charred jalapeno salsa sauce too spicy for my liking (I know this would be spicy though). This wasn't anything special. 3/5

Tacos Al Pastor: Adobo-marinated pork roasted on a Trompo with pineapple. The slice of orange/tangerine gave the taco a nice flavour and texture. The pineapple wasn't very sweet, but the pork was nicely marinated. 3.5/5

Toluca Choriza Burrito: Homemade Mexician chorizo (sausage) topped with an egg. This was my fave dish of the night. I think Cabana's speciality are their burritos. It was a big dish, which for $16 was great value. The flavours were amazing and the egg on top gave it a nice touch. 5/5

I would definitely come back for the Burritos, but prefer Barrio Coreano for their tacos. This place is on the pricer side - we spent about $80 including tax and tip for 4 dishes, 1 alcoholic and 1 non-alcoholic drink."}
{"text":"Going to this restaurant, we did not know what to expect. We had read a bad review in the National Post, so our expectations were quite low. We were expecting simple tex-mex food (which we do like - even if it is just nachos and enchiladas).

However, we were completely surprised by the depth of flavour in all the dishes and their salsas! We had the fiesta nachos, chicken salad, and fish (halibut) tacos. Everything was just spectacular! Subtle flavours are present in each dish that are pleasantly surprising as each bite offers something different. 

The staff was very nice and the service was great - but really, the food is what makes this place special. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm no Mexican food connoisseur by any means, but this has got to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city! The area it's in isn't very lively but there's free street parking all around after 9pm.

We ordered the burrito de mariscos (w/ tiger prawns) and the Baja fish tacos, with guacamole & chips to start. I've been craving guacamole for the past week and now that craving has finally been satisfied; the guac tasted super fresh and we ordered it in medium so it also had a nice kick to it. The tacos were definitely some of the best I've had - fish battered and deep-fried to perfection and good ratio of toppings to protein. I was also surprised by how much I liked the burrito, considering that it was a wet burrito and not something I would usually enjoy. There were lots of prawns and just the right amount of beans and rice; the sauces they used were delicious as well and paired nicely with the burrito. 

In terms of service, it was quite busy when we got there but we were given menus and water immediately and food came reasonably quick too. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for an authentic Mexican dining experience, look no further than Playa Cabana.  A little on the pricey side, but the saying \"You get what you pay for\" rings especially true in this case!   The variety of hot sauces they offer is truly impressive, and I love their chips served with salsa and guac in marble mortars.  The Mojito they serve is truly delicious, and probably the best I've ever had.  Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Yup, the food matches the hype!

Too bad you gotta make a reservation years in advance (not really, but it certainly feels that way). Just make sure you're arriving at the correct location....Playa Cabana has TWO locations on Dupont: this one, and PC Hacienda, which is further east.

The interior is very intimate (ie small), as is the patio. Actually, the whole restaurant looks like a converted home which just adds to its quaintness.

I started with a beautiful glass of sangria (I'm a sangria snob and this one was excellent!) and outstanding guacamole and chips. While we hemmed and hawed about what to order, our server suggested we just share a selection of tacos (\"because that's what most people do\") so we ordered:

Baja fish tacos (grilled, not fried) -- positively delicious
Chicken tacos (\"tacos de pollo al carbon\" with fresh mango salsa) -- great
Braised shortrib brisket tacos -- holy hell!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great time dining here- the service was attentive, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was lively. 

We shared all of our plates. In my opinion, the highlights were the massive burritos (ordered the breaded chicken one) and the pork tacos. 

The food took ages to arrive, so for some this may be an issue, but we were quite happy with our chips with (amazing) salsa and pitchers of margaritas!  

Ordered the churros for dessert and found them to be a bit heavy/ overdone.  

Apparently there is  a great patio in the summer. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for something fun and casual. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"The short rib tacos are the bomb diggity! Never knew you could put rib meat into tacos, but I'm glad they invented it. Perfectly sweet with a nice tangy finish. Rich and diverse. Excellent mouthfeel too - that short rib was tender and moist.

The fish tacos sucked though. It's a catch of the day dish, and today's was baja. We got grilled (as opposed to battered) at the recommendation of our server. It looked kinda bland, tasted bland (reminiscent of overlooked and browned scrambled eggs) and was soggy to the point where the soft tortilla fell apart in my hands and I had to eat the taco ashamedly with a fork and knife. Save your fish taco cravings for seven lives in Kensington.

The guac and chips appetizer was real nice. The guac comes in a nice stone mortar (great looking touch), and comes in three spicy levels: mild medium spicy. The spicy level has the perfect kick to it - spicy, but not overbearing. The chips are homemade and fried - hint of egg, and real tasty, although some -very few- were a bit too oily).

A friend's recommended the Mexican iced tea. Apparently delicious and strong. Gonna have to get next time."}
{"text":"Although we did not have a Friday evening reservation, they gave us a table as long as we finished within an hour.  Guacamole and chips were delicious.  Short ribs and ribeye dinner were also very good.  Service was very good and they are quick to turnover their tables!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Do not love, however, the fact that weekend reservations now have to be made weeks in advance. This means Playa Cabana needs to expand its small space and fast.

I would say it's the best and most authentic Mexican in the city I have come across, with the exception of the \"street meat\" style food that can be found in Kensington Market at El Trompo.

Here you will find amazing guacamole prepared to your spice tolerance and accompanied by homemade tortilla chips, grilled corn, tacos and other favourites served up with the best Margaritas in the city.  The Margaritas deserve a second sentence to express just how good they are with many variations in flavour and tequila.

I just have a couple qualms: 1) the prices would be a little lower in cities with more Mexican options and 2) please expand!"}
{"text":"Went last night for my birthday dinner with my fiance. The service was slow-going for a while as we were not seen for 10 minutes after being seated. I had to let the hostess know, and she told us the name of the fellow who was to be our server and that she would go get him. 
Oddly it was not the person she had mentioned who ended up greeting us, but I'm thankful for that because we watched the other guy throughout his shift and he didn't seem incredibly knowledgeable or attentive. Our server was quick, friendly, and professional! (Ask for Raoul if you're there!)

We got the chips and salsa to start which was great. I didn't find the chips oily at all, and the salsa was delicious. Each of us got the burrito (his veggie, mine steak) and we loved them. They're massive though, and shareable if you don't feel like taking home a doggie-bag! I had to pack mine up.  

My margarita was also great.

My side of guacamole had an avocado pit in the ramekin, which took up quite a bit of it. I didn't want to make a fuss though but I found it extremely peculiar that they would miss that detail. The side of guac was $2.50 and was very small. 

The churros weren't all that good, tough and chewy with melty whipped cream on them. I kind of couldn't believe that I preferred the churros at Tortilla Flats to these ones. 

We sat on the back patio which is a great ambiance and is nice and enclosed. Definitely sit out here if you can! And make a reservation, they filled up quickly.  I would not recommend  this place for large groups. 

Overall a good experience with the food being the best part."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican spot in Toronto. Midtown location works out so well and saves you the trip to downtown for good food. Loved the crispy brisket tacos, the flautas and the burrito. The tres leches cake for dessert was to die for."}
{"text":"Hallelujah, praise the lord!  I've finally found good Mexican food in Toronto!

Playa Cabana had been recommended to me by several people, but it was so hard to get a reservation.  I walked in with a friend at something like 2:30 PM on a weekday, and it was still packed...luckily we just got a table.

First off, the food:
The chips and salsa were very nice.  Great crunchy tortilla chips which they had clearly fried in-house that day (thank you for not using Tostitos).  The salsa was good, but oddly not all that spicy.

I had 3 absolutely delicious fish tacos though.  After the nachos, it was so much food, I didn't need a side of the rice and beans.  The fish was expertly cooked and completely fresh.  They make it with whatever the catch of the day is.  Sweet!  Perfectly accompanied by heat, acid, and cream.  

My friend loved his food too.

Second the service:
The waiter was great, but he was pretty busy.  Sometimes it felt like it lagged a tiny bit, but I think we were coming in around shift change and the place was packed.  Nonetheless, he knew his food and kept us happy.

The atmosphere:
It was rainy, but looks like they have a sweet little patio.  Inside is cramped, but not unbearably so.  I'd rather get in and get a table.

My one complaint:
The music.  Mexican rap.  The choice of music wasn't the problem, it was the volume.  You might have thought it was 1 AM in a Vegas dance club in there.  I'm sure the staff in the kitchen were loving it, but I did not really want to shout to my friend for the entire lunch.  Try turning it down, your customers will still hear it...trust me.

The tequila selection looks pretty good.  I'll have to check it out on my next go around."}
{"text":"I Can't get enough of their tacos! I've been here twice and loved everything that came out. Their menu offers many dishes that can be shared which is great if you want to try a variety of different things. From their tacos, I would definitely recommend their lobster tacos, fish tacos and the ancho braised shortrib-brisket tacos. All their tacos came out really fresh and delicious, packed with a lot of filling. And from their house specials, I would recommend the Carne Asada and Huevos Rancheros. Absolutely delicious! 

I will definitely be coming back soon for more mouthwatering tacos!"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana is a great spot for dinner and drinks.  Here are a few highlights from my experience...

1. Like others who have mentioned this, I did feel rushed to order, then to order more, then to leave. This was slightly annoying, but we were having a good time anyway, and didn't really think much of it until after we left.

2. The tacos are a bit small, but they are fresh and delicious. I would order the chicken tacos again. (Be warned! Some of the table sauces are quite spicy!)

3. If you like guacamole, you will love their chips and guacamole. The chips, which can be a tinge greasy, are tasty and made in house.

4. The service, aside from being a bit rushed, was good. The recommendations for food and drinks were perfect.

5. The vibe is loud and fun. I noticed that there was quite a diverse crowd here, which is nice as well.

6. They have indoor and outdoor seating. To be mere steps from the corner of Davenport and Dupont, the outdoor patio seems quite removed from city traffic and noise.

This is a great spot. There probably aren't many places in Toronto that can match Playa Cabana for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana is about a 15 minute walk from my office and I hadn't planned on going there but the person I had an appointment with nearby wasn't available so I decided to have lunch first.

Walking in, it's a very narrow, small space, almost claustraphobic. The dim lighting didn't help but it set an intimate mood for the place. This looks like a nice neighbourhood watering hole and the immediate neighbourhood is mostly residential.

I ordered the Tostadas with beef and it was served on a crispy tortilla, topped with lettuce, guacamole, black beans, and a few other ingredients.

The presentation was nice and the taste was even nicer! With layers of ingredients, every bite revealed a different flavour and texture and they all worked well together. Delicious!

There were four different sauces on the table, with varying degrees of heat. I tried them all and they were all good.

I may just have to make this walk more often."}
{"text":"Closer to a 4.5/5. Here's a breakdown:

-Homemade guac and chips: Excellent, love that you can vary the heat-level. 
-Corn on the cob: Heavenly, slathered with cheese, onions, and lime juice.
-Chicken wings: Not too greasy, good amount of spice.
-Lobster tacos: Amazing. Lobster was soft and succulent. The guac that came with it also tasted incredibly fresh. 
-Baja fish tacos (battered): I'd say overall they were tasty and fresh, but nothing out of this world. I like how they didn't over-batter the fish. 
-Dave's margarita. Maybe a little too much ice, but still went down smoothly. 

The space is a bit cramped, so it's probaly not the best option for an intimate one-on-one. Music can be a bit loud. On the plus side, our server was friendly and very attentive. And considering all the food we ordered, the bill at the end of the night was also pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't get the opportunity to even eat here because the customer service over the phone was uninviting. I called in to book my birthday dinner originally for 7 people. Later, the reservation needed to be changed to 8, so I called back. I was then told by an employee over the phone, completely brushing me off, that I would need to call back the next day and speak to the manager because the menu setting is different for 8 people or more. I then had to call back, on the day of my birthday, and speak to the manager who simply said, \"It's not possible, you'll be uncomfortable.\" No sign of 'let me see what I can do', or 'let me see how I can accommodate you.' He simply disregarded me. Not a sign of good customer service!"}
{"text":"Positively delicious food. But unfortunately, service is on and off (and when it's off, it's positively terrible). On the other hand, if you're served by the right person, you're in good hands. 

We visited for dinner on a weekday evening and we were seated dismissively by a server who waved us towards the direction of an empty table. Then we sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. For someone to give us a pair of menus. The place wasn't busy at all; servers were just sitting around involved in their own conversations. We tried to wave someone down several times to get a hold of menus, but no cigar. Because, obviously, we came to your restaurant just to sit, twiddle our thumbs, and stare at people eating (not). A good 20 minutes went by before a server came by and asked us what we wanted to order... unfortunately, without a menu we had no idea what to order. She seemed embarrassed that no one had given us menus or had greeted us yet, and brought us menus from the front. From that point forward, service was perfectly fine, as our server attempted to make up for the cold beginning. 

We ordered the guacamole and chips appetizer, the tacos de carnitas, braised short rib brisket  tacos, and a playa burrito. Absolutely delicious. My highlight was definitely the guacamole and chips combo - the chips were homemade, crunchy, and didn't taste like the usual run-of-the-mill corn chips you can get just anywhere. So delicious and had a very interesting texture - they definitely tasted and felt homemade. The burrito was quite large and a bit hard to eat, but the meat in both the burrito and the tacos were very tender and perfectly cooked. 

Ambiance is super dim and romantic - this is a great spot for a date or even dinner with friends. Very casual, relaxing atmosphere. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $58."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice - the first time I remember loving the fresh salsa and the berry-margarita-something-or-other I had to drink. But dinner was forgettable because...well...when I returned I couldn't remember what I'd actually eaten the first time. The second time the food was decent, but darkened by a rather disturbing experience.  About halfway through our meal a server started screaming \"OHMYGOD. OHMYGOD.\" from the kitchen. The curtain to the kitchen was held tight, pretty much every staff member in the restaurant went over to survey what was happening, and at one point, someone rushed out of the room and out the back door, returning a few seconds later. At this point, I heard a server tell the bartender to \"turn up the music\" and whatever it was going on in there, we diners were not to know about it. This was concerning and pretty frankly, quite disgusting given that whatever was happening in the small area, food was still being brought out from behind the curtain. Not sure what it was - of course our imaginations ran wild a bit, but the experience left a very bad taste in our mouths, and I'm not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Mexican restaurant in Toronto. A friend wanted to get some Mexican food, so I yelped and found this gem. 

Place/Ambience: small and gets busy everyday. Went on a Monday night, weather was bad and it was raining, but this place was still packed and there were people lining to get a table. We were a group of 8 and got seats because we went early at 6pm. The ambience was good. A little dim, but that is perfect for a social gathering.

Food:  We did not know what to get and asked our waiter for recommendations. He was very patient and told us the popular dishes, while explaining how each is cooked. I got the Tacos Al Pastor upon his suggestion. The pork was marinated overnight and slowly cooked. It was very good and very flavourful, although the portion was not very big. I also ordered the Mojito Cubana. Not the best mojito I tried, and was a bit on the sour side. My advice, skip the mojitos.

Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely go back again if I am feeling Mexican."}
{"text":"I've been a Playa Cabana fan for a few years now: excellent food, fun ambiance, what more could you ask for? Well, service, it turns out.

The last several times I've been to Playa Cabana, my party and I have been seated within' reasonable time, only to have to wait over an hour for our entreé-- an hour. If this happened once, or even twice, I'd let it go, assuming that the kitchen was understaffed or some other issue, but three times is just one too many. 

Additionally, even if there were some issue with staff, a quick word of warning from the server might give us some options: do we want to order another round of apps while we wait? Are we even okay with such a long wait? But no, in none of these instances were we ever informed that there would be an hour wait after ordering. As a patron, it was frustrating, and as a host to out of town visitors, it was outright embarrassing.

To the management of Playa Cabana: guests aren't unreasonable. A little communication about a situation can go a long way. As for myself, I won't be coming back or recommending the restaurant until some of these services issues are addressed."}
{"text":"I'm retracting all hype!! 

We arrived on time for our reservation, which could not be found. The fact that I received a survey request from OpenTable confirms that we did have a reservation, and I'm not sure why PC can't manage to keep track of this given that they've outsourced the work. We were still seated immediately, but things continued to go downhill. Service was unbelievably slow, although the restaurant was much emptier than usual. Time from ordering guacamole to getting it was TWENTY FIVE mins. Time from guacamole being picked up to entrees dropped off was FORTY mins. Crazy!! PC is also loud and cramped, things which used to be trendy/cool, but are now just getting tired. I'd much rather grab some no nonsense tacos at Tacos El Asador and call it a day."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We came on a Saturday night, which was pretty packed, but the service was phenomenal! The food literally came about 5 minutes after we ordered! The food was very good, and a bit spicy! The tacos are super good and have a unique taste! I definitely recommend this place! You may want to sit outside if you come at night because the music is very loud inside! Overall 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican, and probably very authentic (but what do I know?).

This place was surprisingly busy on a Monday night, but we managed to snag a table for four without issue. The seating is TIGHT though; expect to be rammed against the seat behind you.

Chips and guac are excellent, though I didn't care for the wings.

While the tacos al pastor were good, I think they were trumped by my partner's tacos de chori-queso. I mean, sausage and cheese? Yes please.

That said, the burritos knock the tacos out of the park. In terms of value there's no comparison (burrito the size of my fat head), but the sauces they layer on top are phenomenal. I started diverting chips meant for the guacamole into the remnants of my dish.

Ordering to go is a hassle-free process, and they were prompt and punctual with the food. Given how tight the resto is take-out will be a viable option for us, despite the warm vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Any Mexican place that has horchata as a drink option is already starting off on the right foot. In addition to the amazing guac, delicious food and great service, you can't really go wrong with Playa Cabana. 

Between my friend and I we ordered the guac (obvious choice here, guys!), the braised ancho shortrib taco and the steak burrito,. I was sick, so couldn't share as I normally do, but am assured that the steak burrito was pretty delicious. The shortrib taco was too though, as mentioned by the many Yelpers before me, incredibly oily. I should have heeded the warning because, after 2 tacos, the grease was too much for me and the 3rd taco was left uneaten. Still, a yummy choice for those that don't mind the oily fingers afterwards. 

The only thing preventing this from being a perfect rating was the entirely TOO cozy dining space inside, where we were seated. We were at the bar, knees pressed to the counter and the waiters/waitresses still kept bumping us and/or the table behind us on their way out to deliver food because the space between was SO small. It's not the fault of the waiters, but there has to be a better way... I can only imagine that this kind of disruption happens every day. 
Not enough of a deterrent to stop coming here, though. The food is just too good!"}
{"text":"My second time here and this time I sat outside on the quaint patio which is tops. The place was packed at 9:30pm. 

Had the Cadillac margarita which is fantastic, fresh lime juice,... Not one of those cocktails that after 2 sips it is done. Could drink these non- stop. For appetizer I had the emlotes a la parilla or grilled corn on the cob. So good. My main was brisket crispy tacos. First time I had real hard tacos that didn't come in that taco kit box. They were so good and came with an array of hot sauces.

Efficient service. Decent prices. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my friend and my son on a rainy day. The tables inside are incredibly squished. No elbow room at all.

The waiter wasnt the most great to begin with. I ordered the lobster tacos ($18.00). When i asked if there was anything for children to eat the waiter reluctantly told me that they had chicken quesas. When i asked where on the menu is it, he told me that it wasnt on the menu. I ignored his behavior, and said ok.

The lobster tacos had no flavor. It came with 3 small tacos. On the good side it was packed with lobster meat and got soggy if not consumed in 10min.

Customer service was LOW. Waiter never came around and asked if we were ok, until we asked for the bill he seemed to be interested in our experience then. Not a good sign.

i feel this place is overrated."}
{"text":"This was going to be our second visit to Playa Cabana. I had booked a table for 5 for Friday night 2 days prior... the person who picked up the phone reassured me and confirmed my reservation. When my friends arrived, they couldn't find my name on their reservation list. Apparently, the restaurant thought I cancelled my reservation when I actually didn't! They told my friend that they left me with a text message asking for my confirmation when I have not received anything from them! It was a Friday night and it was going to be very difficult for me and my friends to find another table at restaurants. I will not be coming back for sure. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went today for an early dinner after a show and enjoyed this place. I would give it 3.5/5.  We had the guacamole and homemade chips. The guac size and chips were generous. Chips were a little thick but still tasty.  We had the special shrimp appetizer which were much bigger than the shrimp bucket.  Tasty but only six a plate for $15.  The chicken soft taco with mango salsa was good but needed a bit more flavouring to the chicken.  The chorizo burrito with egg was good and portion was huge! The flavour was great.  Waiter didn't realize we ordered another appetizer so he gave us a tres leches cake on the house which was spongy and soaked up all the milk from the side.  Not too sweet and was a great dessert.  Nice to sit on the patio, the food came out a little slower than expected.  All in all, would come back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I came because of the yelp reviews. But now I'm going to keep coming because the food proved itself. It's soooo good. It's a little bit pricier than some of the other places in Kensington Market but they offer some really good stuff here. One of my personal favorite is the Playa burrito. It's so filling you can probably split it with someone. They also have a really big patio at the back so don't be fooled by how tiny the storefront looks. Service was really slow but good made up for it."}
{"text":"Big portions, good service, good food, unlimited chips and guac. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in the city. First of all, the building is really cool and each floor is decked out with neat designs. The service is SUPERB and the food was high quality and tasty. A lot of the other Mexican restaurants in the city did not have a lot of taste however each bite was filled with delicious flavours!"}
{"text":"Having lived in California for many years and eaten at many Mexican joints, I'd say this place is right at the top tier of the list! It's a tiny place with lots of personality. I sat at the small bar, where the bartender was cool and friendly. The food...gauc with chips to start...as good as anywhere. Entree...carnitas tacos (soft shell) with meat that was so flavorful and tender, accented with an incredible Mexican bbq sauce. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place at first as it look like I'm walking into a duplex, but man was I wrong. I should know that hole in the walls are the best kind. The service probably could have been better which is why the 4 and not the 5. 

The chips are amazing, freshly made, hot and the perfect amount of salt. The salsa you could tell was just made and that it all came straight from the garden. 

My favorite was the short rib taqueria. The short ribs alone I could have eaten bowls of it, full of flavor and so tender. 

The carnitas tacos were also tender but my favorite was the crispy skin, so crunchy and probably oh so bad for me.

The fish tacos were really good too, nice and flaky."}
{"text":"Fun little place around Dupont and Davenport.

We had Guaca & Ceviche as apps. Both very good. Guaca had a great little spicy kick to it too.

We then had pescada tacos+ the tacos al pastor. The tacos were bigger or at least fuller than expected, but the quality was still there so good bang for the buck.

Of all the Mexican restaurants I've been to this is one of the best. The place is small so reserve! It's cramped but a fun cramped, like you're all part of the same big party visiting your new Mexican in-laws at a big pre wedding dinner! Except there we no Mexican nationals there to my knowledge, but you can imagine.

Overall a worth the visit."}
{"text":"Things I noticed about this restaurant:

-It was FREEZING inside, wore my sweater and jacket for most of the meal, girl across from me had her scarf and large sweater on for the whole meal. 

-Noticed that you picked the cheese off my vegan meal..... There was still cheese on it. Thanks. Even heard you arguing with the chef about it. 

-Noticed you served the people next to us who arrived ten minutes later, first with their appetizer and main meal. Awesome.

-Noticed our meal took an hour to get to us. 

-Noticed your inherent lack of enthusiasm, also knowing when you messed up several parts to our order and stopped coming to our table or even making eye contact with us, even though we were pretty damn nice. 

-Noticed you randomly added a three dollar salad to our meal even though I never asked for it. 

-Portions were small and food was pretty good, but the rest made for a frustrating unenjoyable visit. 

Next time when you mess up so badly, acknowledge and apologize."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as good as it gets when it comes to comfort mexican. It wasn't too noisy, or expensive, or salty. Everything was just right. I took my parents, and my father who is the salt police was even surprised how well seasoned everythign was. The staff were great, and the drinks - delish! I would definitely recommend this resto to friends."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! You will need to get reservations at least a week in advance cause this place is sooooo popular and tiny as well. One of the best fish tacos I've had in toronto and certainly authentic mexican food. The mexican corn was $9 and was not worth it at all but it was dammmmm good. This place can become quite pricy when things add up. We got 2 tacos, corn and beer which all came up to about $65 bucks. Its a great place none the less but I probably wont be coming back here for a while"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here the other day with a friend. 

I had the crispy chicken tacos and they were awesome. Three tacos with lots of chicken and veggies. Salsa was a little spicy but just barely. It looked small on the plate but was very filling. My friend had tostadas and liked them too. 

For dessert we shared the churros - 3 churros on the plate with whipped cream on top. Weird presentation but tasted ok. Next time I think I'll skip the desserts, but will come back for tacos!"}
{"text":"Felt like some good Mexican food so checked out Yelp and found this place. Went on the weekend for my boyfriends birthday and so glad we did!

We drove past it twice looking for it (looks like the lower level of a house so I didn't even spot it).  So on to what you want to know!! :)

Food - was sooooooo yummy, I had the AAA Beef brisket taco's I believe they were called and they were so tender and delish. I normally don't go for beef but these were really good. My bf had the same and he loved them.  We had two Margharitas which were really nice. 

Price - So reasonably priced, we shared some nachos (fresh made) and salsa, $4, My margharita was only $6 and my taco's (3 of them) was $14 and for an extra $2 you can get rice and beans. I chose not to and was still full leaving!

Ambiance - I felt like I was in Mexico, it was a cute place for a date. Has a nice crowd and it's pretty cosy (yes in other words the tables are close enough together but it really adds to the place).  Wish I asked to sit on the patio as it was a hot night but was too lazy to move once seated.

Service - Our waiter was so attentive without being too much. First off he had us glasses of water pronto without having to be asked. I was super thirsty and not too impressed at how small the glass was but he was there filling it up everytime I needed it. Seemed like a really nice guy and he was Mexican which added to the experience. 

I am definitely going to be re-visiting this place and have recommended it to lots of people already. Perfect for a date night or with a friend. Wouldn't go here with kids. If you like Mexican food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, I think as good as it gets in Toronto, but good luck getting a seat. It's very small, so even making reservations you will see that space is very limited. Once you're in try everything, you will not be disappointed. Do not go without a reservation. Even their other location is just as busy."}
{"text":"I took my finance here for his birthday on Friday night and our reservation was at 7:00 pm and we were seated right away. The staff was really friendly and very tentative, our water was refilled several times. We also ordered a pitcher of mojitos and that was also refilled several times.

The mojito was the best, we split a pitcher between both of us and later on regretted not having ordered a second one. 

We started out with the ceviche and chips which was pretty tasty. I ordered the shredded beef tacos which were amazing and my fiancée ordered the steak and shrimp burrito which was HUGE. We thought the food was fantastic and all the flavours went really well together. 

To finish the meal off, we ordered the tres leches cake which we thought would be small but the slice was huge and very generous and between both of us we couldn't finish it.

The music was great, the place was packed and we had an overall amazing experience.

We will definitely be returning here again and have already told all of our friends and family."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Toronto from Texas and not having had much luck in satisfying my TexMex fix, I was very pleasantly surprised with PC.  Great service and the food was very good."}
{"text":"I went to Playa Cabana with a relatively large group (12-13 people) and they were great. I had the Guaca Fresca, which was amazing. Large portion of guacamole (mild is actually not spicy at all), and the chips were delicious as well.

For the main, I had the Tacos De Pescado, which is the fish tacos. The tacos were on the sour-side of the taste palette, especially with the coleslaw in it. I would recommend not putting any more lime on it. The fish was very fresh.

Overall, customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Playa Cabana before and loved it (as in 5 out of 5 kind of love). However, this time around, it was a huge disappointment.

I purposely chose this restaurant for my birthday because I loved it so much and I wanted to share this restaurant with my friend. However, I found the staff not as friendly this time around. When one of the waitress brought our food to the table, she knocked down my friend's utensils and didn't even apologize. I know that it was only a minor accident and she's only human so I shouldn't judge her for it. However, just a quick \"sorry\" was all that's needed. Instead, she just rolled her eyes after throwing down the dish and walked away. Great service is an element of a great restaurant and that waitress clearly does not belong there.

Also, we went there early for dinner (as in before 7). For dessert we ordered churros and they said they ran out of dulce de leche. How could they have possibly run out of dulce de leche when we're one of the earlier customers of the night?"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  The food was delicious and well priced for the portion size and quality.  The space was fun and loud, but not too loud.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly.  The Cadillac Margaritas were AMAZING!  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular, and it was tight getting a seat on a Friday night, but thankfully there was only two of us and small table left in the back. The atmosphere is cozy, hip and modern Mexican, sometimes, it's nice being only six inches from your neighbouring table! And I'm glad we were able to sneak in, because everything was fabulous. 

We started off the meal with homemade chips and salsa. I wish there was an endless bowl of each for me to munch on all day and all night. The salsa was bright and fresh with just enough heat to slap your tongue around. The chips were warm and crisp and the perfect vehicle to get the salsa to your month. Next came the chicken tostadas and ancho braise short rib tacos. The chicken tostadas came piled hight with guac and crema with some black beans thrown into the mix to give the meal some weight. The surprise of the dish though, the rice! I chased down every single grain of rice that was on that plate. The short ribs had a delicious depth of flavour that was balance by the pico de gallo. 

My mouth is watering while I write this review just thinking of the salsa and rice. Next time, I'm going to have to wash all that delicious food down with a margarita!"}
{"text":"A mediocre Mexican restaurant in a neighbourhood with pretentious clientele.  

My husband and I went here on the suggestion of a friend and we didn't make reservations.  We had to wait for at least an hour or so, or if someone didn't show up for their reservation - which ever came first.  I think this is poor planning on the restaurant's part.  I think they should set aside a few tables, at least, to accommodate those who didn't make reservations and who came here on a whim.

While we were waiting in line, people would ask if we had a reservation to which we replied \"no.\"  They would then give this smug look and say \"We do!\"  Okay, relax there buddy.

The food was okay.  I guess if you've  never had Mexican food you would think this was good.  I've been fortunate enough to taste Mexican food from California made by real Mexicans so eating here was just \"meh.\"  The fish tacos had too much salad piled on top and the fish wasn't tasty at all.  My husband got a burrito and he, being a Californian native, didn't enjoy it.

Can't say we would go back here.  Two thumbs down - one for the food and one for the people."}
{"text":"Raul is the sever to have. He's charismatic, attentive, fun and makes the best mojitos!

We started off with the octopus taco appetizer. The flavor was great and the texture was pretty good. While I was told the tacos aren't much to write home about... apparently it is all about the toastados! My friends got the vegetarian while I had the chicken version. WOW. They're huge and delicious. You can't dine here without trying one. My friend's husband had a burrito which he really enjoyed. We were given guacamole & chips & churros later on. The guacamole was pretty good and churros were amazing! Crispy yet soft and full of flavor. We also ordered the tres leches for dessert. Let me tell you, I'm not a dessert person, but I could not stop eating it!

It's not a big restaurant, but the service and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I took the recommendations of many and did make a reservation for a Saturday night a few days in advance, which was wise because we got the last table available. The space might be tiny, and the chairs might wobble a little bit, but the latin music will keep your body swaying. You will definitely find an authentic Mexican feel compared to any of the other restaurants in the city, but on to the food!

We started with the grilled corn with lime and quesco fresca. It is permeated with lime, and it tastes as if it has been swimming in a vast sea of lime. It is quite flavourful and delicious. Just wish it came with more cobs!

For our mains, we shared a plate of the ancho braised short rib tacos in the golden crispy tortillas, and a plate of tacos al pastor. The better of the two was definitely the ancho braised short rib. The crispy taco sets them apart from some of the other taco joints in the city, and the flavour and texture was quite superior to the tacos al pastor. The only downside is they can be a little messy. The tacos al pastor was pretty light on the pineapple, and could have used a little sauce, and even seemed smaller than the short rib. Plus they came in a soft tortilla shell which wasn't as special. I don't think I'd order them again. On the other hand, the short rib tacos were good enough that we ordered another round.

And on to dessert. The tres leches cake was amazing and one of the best desserts I've ever had. At a reasonable 7 dollars, and big enough for sharing. This is a dessert you don't want to pass on. It isn't overall sweet, and it doesn't taste one note. I found the taste and texture of the dessert transformed in my mouth and finished differently on both accounts. 5 stars for this dessert, and would be the main reason I would go back. It will leave you feeling good about your choice of passing on a McFlurry from McDonald's on the way home, and if that is not a win, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at Playa Cabana a few days prior for 3PM on a Saturday afternoon. When we arrived at 2:30PM a little early for our reservation the place was packed. They were able to seat us early and were very accommodating. 

The restaurant is small and tight with a casual & fun atmosphere. It was loud but not so loud you couldn't hear each other. 

The service was very good, we got severed quickly, received our drinks quickly and food in a reasonable amount of time.

The chips and salsa are very good as were the other items we ordered.

Overall the food was very good. My husband & I both agreed that La Mexican is still better but would go again without hesitation. 

If you are planning to go, make a reservation, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Great, authentic food at reasonable prices. Not blown away, not disappointed.

Had dinner with the boyfriend on a Saturday night in the cramped, no-elbow-room front section of the restaurant. Drinks and food came at a good pace, but I probably won't remember much about my visit in a few weeks."}
{"text":"By far, the most delicious Mexican food in the city. The biggest problem is that there's no air conditioning, or at least, no air conditioning that guests can FEEL. 

I strongly suggest guac and chips, the fried fish tacos, and any of the absolutely massive and delicious burritos!"}
{"text":"Came back for lunch again, food is still as amazing as I remembered from last time. 

I'ved tried couple other Mexican places in Toronto since my last visit but I will always come back here. Amazing portions leaving me full and satisfied.

Shout out to the Dos Berries drink. 11/10"}
{"text":"The only negative thing about this place was that I had to walk from St. George subway station. Arrived at the place and was seated immediately. Service was quick and straight to the point!

Started with the freshly made guac and chips. Guac was on point and definitely could taste the freshness of it. Chips were home made, light and crispy. Chips were able to sustain the dipping and did not crumble under the dense guacamole. 

Quickly after that it was followed by the corn. Very jooocey and succulent. Grilled to perfection and seasoned well. Possibly one of the best things I ordered tonight. Could be a bit messy to eat but well worth the trouble. 

On came the tacos and burritos. No idea what they were called but they were definitely not your average taco and burritos.  Would not order these two again but that's just a personal preference. 

Finished with a churros dessert. Came out piping hot and smelt fantastic. 

Overall a FANTASTIC experience! Would definitely dine at this place again without a second thought."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad! Food was great, prices great, service great!
It's a small little place so keep an eye open while driving by.
Gets busy quick so call ahead and make reservations."}
{"text":"Main food was good but chips were not fresh and cost too much also it is too cramped in there likely won't go back better places with more room."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, Kayla was our server and she whipped up a wicked Mexican ice tea for me in no time at all. The meal was great, I had the short rib taco and it kicked ass."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened to stumble upon this restaurant after being unprofessionally turned down by Rose and Sons 4 minutes walk away (See my review on them under my account).

They had the cutest patio out front, but it was way too hot and humid and I was so hungry and tired I needed food in my belly while being comfortable too. I didn't realise until later, but Barrio Coreano is part of this chain, and I loved that place too!

I started with the Guaca Fresca. It was made to order in a lava rock molcajete. I had it in medium spice and it was perfect! Smooth zesty with a bit was sweet and spice. I am not sure if they make the chips in house too, but they were quite good too! crunchy not oily and not overly salted.
I also ordered the  Ancho Braised Short-rib - Brisket Crispy Tacos. I made such a mess but it was so worth it! I didn't even care my face was covered in saucy Short-rib goodness. 
The tacos were so flavourful and juicy. It was loaded with a lot of good ingredents like AAA Ontario Beef shortrib, ancho chiles, pico de gallo, guac, and homemade crema.

The restaurant had a rustic Mexican feel. I felt like I was in a Mexican truck stop. A clean safe Mexican truck stop with clean cutlery LOL!!!

The servers and bartenders were very friendly and welcoming. I didn't have a reservation booked and they seemed busy, but they still accommodated us...unlike Rose and Sons which a reservation was booked!

I will go back there again maybe at night to see how their ambience transitions."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 4 years ago during my visit to Canada and I swear I remembered how I liked the food. This time food was exactly as good as I remember. The only thing that screwed up our visit was the waitress who was incredibly nice and friendly all the time. However, in the end she dropped one box with leftovers and all we had for the wasted food we paid for was an apology. I think she would offer us something instead. However, when I'm next time in Canada I will definitely try to go to this place again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, without a reservation. Sat outside, on their \"patio\". Was a very poor experience overall:

Had some appetizer and burrito for main. Took ages (over 30mins even for appetizers - some nachos) and it tasted below average.
Server/service. was pretty nice. However they have no clue as what respecting a customer means.. they asked people to move from table (while enjoying drinks/food) so that they can install their heaters. This was terrible.
Also, the seating is so cramped and poorly designed, with little to no space between tables and servers brushing by your table/chair while serving other people. Greedy most likely, to just bump up the profit by squeezing tables/people like cattle.

On top of that, the prices were quite high, so all in all a huge miss and a place to never go back."}
{"text":"Super cute patio, amazing tacos and strong margaritas! Will definitely return. 

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the guacamole and ceviche were on the mediocre side, and we felt a little rushed since we came near closing time."}
{"text":"I came here on a date with my fiancee, on a Friday night at about 10 PM. It was a pretty random pick, as we were debating between Barrio Coreano and Playa Cabana and just hoped we didn't have a long wait - we were hungry!

When we showed up the place was pretty full, both inside and on the patio. We asked one waiter what the wait was for a table inside (as it was pretty chilly out) he said 30-45 minutes, I was so sad! Luckily another waiter spotted us and told us there was a table of 2 that had just cleared up - so we eagerly took a seat.

To drink: we ordered 2 Micheladas (Mexican beer, lime juice, and assorted sauces, spices, and peppers. It is served in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass) - it wasn't on the Menu - so if you haven't tried it yet - I definitely recommend it! To eat: We ordered Ceviche del Dia (I am Peruvian and so by default am a ceviche judge), 3 Tacos de Pescado (Baja Style) and 3 Tacos Ancho braised Shortrib brisket Crispy Tacos.

The server punched in the Ceviche but the kitchen never saw it, so they forgot about the Ceviche, which had me a bit bummed at first, but then when I was about finished my third taco, I  realized it was probably a blessing in disguise... I was absolutely full! The Tacos were great, they Brisket tacos, had pico de gallo, frejoles and guac, they were very rich in flavours, very tasty; and the fish tacos were larger and more filling than I expected, fried goodness - squeeze that whole lime wedge on top and you have perfection!!

So overall, I would definitely return and have remained super curious to try out their Ceviche, thus *Terminator Voice* I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"It was mediocre at best.  Cramped space with average service. This is far from anything authentic which they don't claim to be.  Server said guacamole was their most popular app and it tasted good but nothing outstanding. Mains forgetful. The churro was the highlight of the meal.  

 I was in on a Friday night with reservations for 2.  Told we only had the table until 9pm.  Kinda odd but worked for us.  

Good luck finding parking anywhere close on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto.
It reminds me a lot of Grand Electric in many ways, but I rate it higher than Grand Electric because the menu is authentic, larger, they takes reservations, and the place has a level of raw authenticity. 

The food will blow your mind. It's simple and real mexican flavours, taco's made from scratch, kitschy and funny menu items like the bucket of shrimp, beautifully real ceviche, and even oysters. And well on the reasonably cheap side of the spectrum. 

The space is intimate and cute. It's tucked away at Dupont and Davenport, and is a neat little place to get away from the craziness of the Annex but still experience it's charm. 

The service is excellent. But don't go without a reservation. You will wait an hour or two even with the patio open in the summer."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite Mexican restaurants in Toronto right now! I'm not Mexican so I can't vouch for authenticity, but the flavours were spot on! 
My friend and I shared the shrimp bucket for appetizers:
Simply delicious butter and spice marinade! The only difficulty I found was in getting the shell off the shrimp meat, which was a disappointment because the shell taken on most of the flavour!

For our main course we opted for the beef short rib tacos:
These were amazing! The taco shell (I think they used paratha instead of a traditional corn shell?) was crispy while the beef inside was the best I've had! It comes with various toppings and a decent portion of guacamole which goes perfectly! 

I don't remember his name, but our server was amazing. Although it got busy super fast, my glass of water was never empty! 

Definitely make a reservation beforehand as it is a small place, but soo worth it. (Especially if you're looking for spicy food - they had the best chillies)"}
{"text":"Went for my sister's birthday with a group of her friends, note: this is not a place for large group (ie. anything more than 2 people).

The food was good.  Fresh ingredients, good size portions, flavourful, simple and made with love.

The service was attentive, polite and helpful.

This is a tequila bar, so don't expect a wide selection of scotch or vodka.  Their cocktails are creative and bring out the different tequila flavours. 

The space is where they lack and the \"intimate\" setting just gets annoying.   Because of proximity to everything else in the restaurant, it gets loud and it was hard to maneuver around especially since there was a group of us.  So if you're claustrophobic, wait till you get a seat on the patio. 

Also, it's a bit pricey, but affordable considering the area.  It's about $8 for a plentiful side of guacamole and chips and $13 for tacos.  Which as I'll say again and again in my review of taco places- is too much for street food. 

Parking is difficult, street parking only, but the subway is about 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"good food, good drinks, fair price. nice cozy patio"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana definitely lived up to the hype. Went with a large group which presented the opportunity to do a tasting menu of a variety of different tacos and some apps as share plates. Listing everything would be an endeavour but the stand outs were definitely the fresh, flakey fish tacos, savoury rib steak tacos, and flavourful octopus tacos. The tostadas were impressive and the in-house hot sauces were all phenomenal. Definitely made a lasting impression, not to mention a great tequila selection and cocktail list."}
{"text":"Going to this place has become a ritual for my boyfriend and I. We go every year when the patio opens. We don't go more often only because we eat way too much every time. I'd recommend getting more appetizers than meals. My fav combo is the guac, the corns and the shrimp (sorry I don't recall the Spanish words). I personally didn't love the Chorizo sausage. It was too spicy and saucy for me. 

Service has room for improvement. Last time we were here we had to wait for the menus for 20 minutes, but to their defence it was super busy on the patio and it's not like they could fit any more servers. 

Unlike other patios on Dupont, this one is on the street and super cozy. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
This feels more like a Cuban little hideaway off a side road than it does on Dupont and Davenport. Clandestine is putting it mildly. You can almost doubt yourself that you're going the wrong way here. Note: walking from Dupont will be a shorter walk than walking from St. George station. Both can be done. 

That said, you could immediately feel the warmth and coziness of Playa (from herein called PC). I know this place is busy, so I called to make a reservation and even then we had to wait for their brand new back patio. It was definitely worth it!  Note: this was at 9 p.m. on a Monday night on a holiday weekend so if you're coming here on a weekend come very early. 

The bartenders were nice (and not bad to look at) but they know how to make a mean margarita. Also, they have MOJITO PITCHERS. That said, it wasn't as strong as I expected. 

Back to the back patio: it's very cute! They've got outside heat lamps and trees that make it very intimate and the ideal second date place (good Mexican food deserves to be reserved for date deux or trois). They can also accommodate groups as well and have high tops. It works! 

Service was good. 

WE ATE 
Oh, we ate! The guac has lots of flavour with lime and a bit of a spicy kick. It definitely filled us up while we were waiting for our tacos. 

First choice were the fish tacos and they sold out. So we moved onto the chicken tacos and the steak tostadas. I did feel there was a bit of a charred taste to both the tacos and tostadas but otherwise, the taste was ALL there. 
Everything had plenty of accoutrements (including more guac, bestill our heart). 

My favourite dish was the steak tostadas. It comes with this orange rice; I'm not sure what exactly is in the rice but all I know is that I wanted more and more. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
A busy restaurant that lets you talk until it's closing down is a good restaurant in my books. It's nice to have a quality Mexican restaurant that's intimate and doesn't feel like it's in Toronto. Don't stop. Get it. Get it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars = 5 stars for food+4 stars for restaurant space and lay out

Super small restaurant with super big flavors (sorta like the 8 year olds on X Factor/Britain's Got Talent belting out those tunes!)

Went there with some older folks (who were a bit put off by the high decibel levels) on a Thursday night: it was packed! I thought it was a great place to get good booze and will come back with similarly aged people for a more fun experience (basically for more alcohol).

The guac was amazing: not too heavy and very fresh. The surf and turf burritto could've fed an entire mexican village! It was very well done but I would've preferred the orange sauce on the side instead of submerging the burrito in it. I prefer my dishes spicy so I asked for their spicy salsa and our server got me two kinds of spicy salsa. I absolutely loved them both! So folks ask for the spicy salsa. The churros were great as well: doughy, cinnamony,creamy!

The service was a tad slow but given the rush, totally understandable. Our waitress was great:patient with the menu, attentive with the water and funny.

p.s. Always make reservations; it fills up pretty quick."}
{"text":"This place IS THE SHIEET! This is a review coming from someone who doesn't normally go out and eat Mexican cuisine. But man, this place was SUPER delicious. Will definitely plan to be back again.

I came on a Tuesday night with a friend. The place was pretty packed. We didn't make a reservation, but luckily we were seated right away by the window. Setting: wooden tables, tables extremely close to each other (I probably could've elbowed the person adjacent to me - I suspect they tried to squeeze in as many tables as space will allow), and some decorations that, well, look Mexican haha. They dimmed the lighting sometime during the night. At first it seemed too dark, but after my eyes adjusted, it was quite nice. Is this what they call ambience? I'd say so.

Food: I got the tostada with ground beef. I can't eat kidney beans but the waiter was happy to accommodate and gave me more rice instead. It was DELICIOUS. Tangy ground beef. Crispy, freshly fried shell. Diced lettuce perfectly placed, with smooth smooth avocado in the middle, sprinkled with corn. My favourite part was this white, mayo-like sauce that they crosshatched across the tostada. 

Service: Waiter came and left a bottle of water on our table, but came regularly to pick up said bottle and refill our glasses with it. Pretty good service!

I'm not gonna lie: the majority of my previous experience with 'Mexican food' was with Taco Bell, so you should read my review with that in mind. But, after Playa Cabana, I can never go back. I wish I had more experience with Mexican cuisine so that I had a better frame of reference than Taco Bell haha, but there you have it. Come to Playa Cabana and have your palette elevated to, as they say, a WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL."}
{"text":"Everything here is pretty much amazing. You cant go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Tacos are by far their best dishes, everything else is still delicious, but their Tacos are by far their claim to fame.  

Don't show up unless you have a reservation though, because there is a standard 1-2 hour minimum wait period if you just show up."}
{"text":"Bartender Grahm and  Server Julian made the night an extra 5 Stars!  After \"high end\" dining all over Toronto, we decided to go local.  We happened upon this gem.  TEENY so..be prepared to mush in but worth it!  Drinks creative and relish.  Chips (ALWAYS) the barometer and definer between \"eeh and GREAT\" were..GREAT!  Salsa great!   Not at all stuffy!  Crowd local and chill.  Manager could smile a bit more but the rest of the team was terrific!    A wonderful neighborhood eatery.  Everyone that came in was greeted with name recognition or a smile and wave.  Vegetarian dish was flavorful and abundant.   Tacos great too!   RESERVATIONS A MUST!!  Happy Chip-n-Dipping!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had! And that's saying a lot because I'm not usually a big fan of Mexican food. 

This place is tiny but has a few floors as well a couple of balconies. It's super trendy and fun however, and the food is great and decently priced. Some items like the corn ($10) are a bit expensive in my opinion for the portion. 

Most of the party got the short rib tacos, these came on a crispy shell, I had the fish tacos which were in a soft shell, and you can order them singularly or in orders of 3. The tacos aren't quite a meal in my opinion, but accompanied by an order of the corn, split between two people and the guacamole and chips, I was stuffed. 

The tacos are great, loaded with some nice fresh ingredients. I preferred my fish tacos to the short rib ones, the batter was light and crispy and came out piping hot, only to be cooled and freshened up by some crisp veggies and a great sauce. I'm not sure what the fish was however! The short rib were also great, the shell was crisp but not like a old El Paso taco kit, still had some flexibility to it so it didn't fall apart. The meat was flavourful and tender as well. The guacamole was delicious, definitely a must have, and the corn was also great, a bit spicy and a bit cheesy. 

The restaurant is a great space, it looks like a house from the outside and it's ultra trendy inside, fun music and the service was great and friendly. Water glasses and drinks were filled constantly, however the glasses were quite small so they were being refilled a lot! 

Overall a fun place to go with friends or a date. I would definitely come back for the fish tacos and guacamole. The octopus tacos looked pretty good as did the burritos, might be worth a try next time!"}
{"text":"Their Guac and hot sauce can do no wrong - really enjoyed it.

Beware, you can get carried away with the chips and indulging in the guac and may be stuffed by the time your Entree arrives"}
{"text":"Ok food. Terrible service. Our appetizers and main courses arrived before our drinks!  It was very obvious we were being rushed out. We could have saved $100 bucks and eaten at Mucho Burrito."}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant is hard to find and we passed by a few times. The Google map led us to the wrong location (almost one block west). 

The place is pretty small but I like the vibe of the place. There are a few areas can accommodate group of 6-8 people. Service is prompt and friendly. 

My review is based on my lunch time experience. Two of us shared two appetizers and one burrito. 

Poblano corn crab cake with fresh Dungeness crab - they have rich taste of crab and the sauce is very, but I wish the crab meat could be more moist in terms of texture

Tacos de Pulpo (our favourite)
- First I couldn't find it from the main course Taco section, but found it in the appetizer. A order comes with two tacos. Each one has a big piece of tentacle with spicy guacamole and corn topping. The tentacle is very tender and flavourful. Love this dish very much!! 

Toluca Chorizo Burrito
- Chorizo is flavourful and well mixed with rice and the sunny side up Egg enhance the flavour and texture. The green and red tomato sauce are nicely down. The portion is quite sizeable for one person. Recommend to share it with others so you can try their appetizers and dessert!

Definitely wanna come back to try other dishes especially the sponge cake with cream!"}
{"text":"Our friends suggested this place to us when we went to visit them in Toronto as this is their go-to spot for great Mexican food and I can definitely see why ! The food was so fresh and flavourful and the portions were very filling and for a great price ! we shared the spicy shrimp bucket to start , the shrimp were nice and big and very fresh but if you're not a fan of spicy this may not be the choice for you. butttttt if you like spicy food like I do then these are a great choice - muy caliente ! We also had the octopus taco which I was very excited about since I love octopus but I never really had it in taco form - it was delicious (also spicy) the octopus was grilled to perfection and the fresh corn and fresh toppings made it even better. As the main course my boyfriend and I shared the chorizo burrito which came topped with a fried egg, salsa Roja, salsa verde and cotija cheese. The burrito is pretty big and pretty freaking delicious ! (Though not really spicy but very flavourful). For dessert we shared the tres leches cake which was so light and not overly sweet. Also worth mentioning is the fact that they offer indoor and outdoor seating and do serve a variety of beers and cocktails. My only complaint is that the indoor seating is a little bit tight so there's not much room but as soon as the awesome food came I forgot all about that ! All in all I really enjoyed playa cabana and think it's a great spot to go with some friends or a date for some great Mexican food !"}
{"text":"We were there a month ago with another couple...wonderful food overall!  We shared all of the dishes which included:   the grilled corn (was good but not memorable), short rib tacos, chicken, pork and fish tacos.  The tacos were great...our favourites were the short rib and the Baja fish tacos!  We also tried their guac and chips (would pass on this next time).  As noted, it can get very warm in the small restaurant.  We will definitely go back!  Remember to make a reservation in advance as they do get busy.  Service is great as well."}
{"text":"I'm always looking to try New Mexican places In toronto so we went to playa cabana . The place is fair small and has an authentic Mexican ambiance . I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially for dinner as there is limited seating . The service was a little slow overall. 

We ordered three appetizers 
Chips and salsa - 4/5 - the salsa felt like it was lacking flavour
Corn - you get 4 pieces of corn - 3/5 - the corn was sweet instead of being spicy or more flavourful. 
Chorizo conquistador - 3/5 - basically bbq chorizo slices .

For the mains we chose to get 3 hard and 3 soft tacos . Unlike other Mexican restaurants you cannot pick individual tacos . You have to get 3 of the same kind - hard or soft 

Hard chorizo taco - 5/5 - hands down the best thing we ate there. It was full of flavour and spice. It came with guacamole and salsa . The ground chorizo was way tastier than the appetizer chorizo slices . 

Soft taco - chicken with mango 
2/5 - no flavour at all in the chicken . It was cold and lacked flavour all together . Either the chicken was made hours ago or the chef didn't put any time into preparing it . We are 1.5 of the 3 tacos and let the rest go back 


For dessert - you have 3 choices 

We opted for cheesecake with caramel . The cake was average and it was the equivalent of a grocery store cake . 


Overall - the ambience and select items showed potential but not sure if we are going to go back here as there are several other Mexican places that might be better . 

Will keep searching other hidden gems !!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic little kiss of Latin flavour tucked away in the Annex!  And what better way to chase away this stubborn Canadian coldness with some Mexican heat!! 

 Playa's itself is situated inside a converted house located within of a fairly residential area of Dupont and Dav, but don't let the rustic little cottagey interior fool you as the patrons here were definitely rocking the status handbags and cosmetic surgery to match.  Not to worry though as the pricing of the menu at Playa's is reasonable. 

The Margarita line-up at Playa's is fantástico, and with over 40 brands of Tequila ranging from Blanco, Reposado to Anejo there is so much in the way of bevvies to relish trying here!   Playa's also serves the amazing Jarrittos Mexican sodas in tantalizing tropical flavours like Tamarind, Pineapple and Guava.

Service is quick efficient and warm, plus our waiter was a blue-eyed blond dream boat with a Latin accent, what more could you want!!!  For Bocaditos we ordered the holy coupling of Guaca Fresca along with Fresh Salsa both served in lava rock molcajete bowls.  Eating guac and salsa this good and piquantly fresh, it was hard not to take advantage of refills for the delightfully crisp hand-pressed tortilla chips.  

For mains I got the Baja Style Tacos De Pescado which are soft shell fish tacos fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza.  Mmmmmm, so far I can say these are the best fish tacos I've ever had with just the right ratio of light crumbly crisp batter encasing mouthwatering Tilapia.  My girlfriend ordered the day special of a three taco sampler of chicken, carnitas and brisket and was literally gasping between bites whilst singing their savoury praises.

If there's one complaint I have it is that Playa's space is tiny so seating (especially the front area) is pretty cramped and the place fills up real fast so if you get a chance try to book yourself a reservation online to ensure a spot http://rez.urbanspoon.com/reservation/start/3991?source=selfhost
 
My girlfriend and I ended our lovely Mexican meal in the best way possible which is indulging in Churros with Crema, are you drooling yet?? yeah I thought so!

So you should forget about making a run for the border, as it's much better get your ass to Playa Cabana for some real cozy Mexican flavour and charm."}
{"text":"Loved it! Best Mexican I've had in Toronto.The Guaca Fresca was amazing, as well as the Enchiladas Suizas. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A totally enjoyable meal. We started with the gauc and chips. Yum. For my main I had the chorizo burrito with pinto beans. It was delicious and the serving was large enough that I have leftovers for tomorrow's dinner. Our server was attentive and pleasant and our food came out promptly. As we were leaving, four separate employees thanked us for coming. iI would come back!"}
{"text":"I am guilty of selfishness, I know. I didn't want to review this place for the longest time to keep it secret, but I guess now after a 100 smth review the secret is officially out. Yes, it's true. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!

Reserve your table!!! It not easy to get in.
If you manage to get in, order without looking at a menu: guaca fresca and a bucket of Negra Modelo, then relax a look at the menu.
My personal favorite is seafood and steak burrito that comes with two amazing sauces and is huge so sharing is recommended. Add some corn on the cob to that and you're set for a Mexicana adventure Toronto style. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"came here last night for the first time. there was no wait because we came at 9:45 but I can see why it would get so packed. its quite small and cozy. the patio was so pretty at night-had lanterns everywhere which gave it a nice atmosphere. it was too cold too sit outside though so we sat inside. equally nice atmosphere with music and nice lighting. 

our waiter was very friendly. we started with guac (medium spice) which was one of the best ive had lately. I went on to have chicken enchiladas and beef tacos. both were yummy and had nice presentation with toppings. I found the shredded beef a bit heavy because they put a good amount of meat in there plus the tortilla is fried crispy but it was good nonetheless.

I had the Mexican ice tea which I would get again-it definitely had enough tequila to keep me happy :) 

will probably try to drag my boyfriend back again to try other dishes"}
{"text":"On my quest to find the best Mexican food in the city, and a suggestion from a sweet friend of mine to check this place out while we were out for a walk one day, we decided to stop in and wait for it to open for dinner at 5. Good thing we were the first to arrive as this place gets CRAZY packed. And I do mean, crazy. It's rocking every night of the week. I couldn't even believe just how busy it gets.

Cool setup on the inside, and great outdoor back patio. And 2 words: Sooooo good! Unbelievably good. I can't even say this enough. The wait staff were all cool and friendly, and the food. Damn. It was good. We had a pitcher of Margarita, which went down smooth on a hot summer's day (we could've shared another if we weren't already feeling so loopy from a booze-soaked happy dinner), and shared the Baja-style Tacos de Pescado (fish of the day tacos), and the Carne Molida Picadillo Burrito (slow cooked beef). The fish tacos were good, but the beef burrito definitely topped both of our lists, and this would be the one to have next time. Delicious, slow cooked, tender, and just oozing with flavour. And everything was so fresh; the way that Mexican food should be. We could've ordered another burrito, but it would've been pure gluttony (not that I have any issues with that) ;) 

I definitely recommend making a reso in advance or you will be turned away from the door (sadly, this happened to us our second time). Best times of day to call to make a reso are between 1-4pm, otherwise the staff are so busy with managing the inside that they don't get around to answering the phones (we tried this approach as well). If you can't make a reso, show up right at opening in order to secure yourself a table. Totally worth it and it ranks as my fave mexican restaurant in the city, by far. Good portions, delicious food, cool wait staff, great drinks and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whew.... burrito bros or playa cabana? That would be a tough decision for me. Each are completely different establishments yet both will give you a full stomach.

Full marks for the menu and the variety. I eyed a good five or six dishes to try and was nearly disappointed when I realized I had to choose one. 

A bit slow on the service but the ambience is quite fun. It's busy at lunch and I'm sue it's busier at dinner. I can only imagine how hard it would be to find a seat at that hour.

We had a group of six and they accommodated us well. No complaints there. I hope to enjoy more burritos in the near future here."}
{"text":"Before I go into why I gave Playa Cabana 2 stars, I'll give credit where credit is due.  The service here is solid... they quickly addressed the first concerns of the inedible octopus but they also asked how my dish was when they clearly saw that I did not finish one taco of the 3 they gave.  So the really nice server we got was good.  If the kitchen followed the lead of the service, you'd have a good Mexican spot... that sadly didnt happen.

On Dupont which looks more of a quiet residential street of Toronto, you'll find a packed, lively, and crowded Playa Cabana.  You can clearly feel the vibe and sounds coming from the restaurant as you walk through the patio.  There's a buzz of activity from the young servers going between the extra squished tables filled with family or older couples that have bags of Royal Doulton and William Sonoma crowding into the minimal walking area.

The menu is simple and easy to understand with it looking somewhat reasonably priced... It looks great on the menu till you might get in person and then question the value.  Just a word of caution there.  I should have tempered my expectation on Playa Cabana (even though it is ranked 4 stars) because Carmeka (Chicago yelper before me) mentioned this isnt real Mexican.  After going to Chicago 4 times last year and San Diego the year before, my love for real Mexican is there and this ... isn't it... at all.

Guacamole & chips - Simple guacamole with a side of corn chips.  I would say that the flavour compared to what I've had in San Diego is missing... this is far more bland but adding in some heat from the sauces kicks it up.  Chips are a bit thicker than I've experienced but they're crunchy and not oily.  For $9, I find it a bit expensive for the small amount but then again, avocado prices have jumped so maybe it's at the right price point.  3/5

Pulpo Taco (Octopus) 2 tacos - Oh Toronto... please do not tell me you think this is 4 star quality octopus taco.  The octopus given was smaller than the length of the fork tines (about an inch or so) and completely rubber... I took a good 20 seconds with a fork and knife just trying to cut through and only got 80% of the way through.  It's supposed to be tender and yet lightly charred at the last minute grilling to get that flavour ... and this wasn't it. Completely inedible.  Thankfully they took off this bill.  1/5

Tacos al Pastor (Pork) - We had this rendition at El Loco Local and though I didnt love that version, I felt this one didn't match up that one.  It's supposed to be tender and flavourful pork with pineapple ... the pork was ok and the pineapple was really mandarin or orange segments that tasted overly sugary and syrupy... as if they were canned or jarred.  It didnt have any balance.  2/5

Pescado Baja style Tacos (Battered Fish) - This seems like an odd comment but this fish was way too large for the taco and it was buried under way too much shredded cabbage.  I guess it could look instagram pretty at that level but it made it frustrating to eat.  It has zero balance and flavours werent the focus.  In addition to the fish being 2 times the size of the taco shell, the batter was nearly 2 cm thick in some parts.  Overall, there's no flavour.  At least the fish was cooked through, not greasy, and served hot.  That's the only plus.  I didnt even finish one taco.  2/5

Horchata - I'm not sure if this is housemade but if it is... its has too much water and sugar.  My favourite is from Chicago where its has a wonderful lingering cinnamon taste and sweetened just right.  The rice is supposed to give it a creaminess instead a watery feel.  This wasn't close.  2/5

Maybe we came when their kitchen staff is changing up and learning?  I'm not sure but the recipes here were bland and the execution just left everything inedible.  For $30 per person, we got a lot of inedible food... I'm starting to get the feel that Toronto doesnt do Mexican food well anywhere in our city."}
{"text":"I was told by my friends that this is one of the best Mexican restaurants for tacos. I checked it out today and I can say that it is indeed pretty good. In the summer they have an awesome patio, which is always packed. Even though it's kinda small, the atmosphere is very intimate. Their mojito is one of the best in Toronto and they make it with either rum or tequila. I tried a tequila-based mojito and it was a little sour, but tasted pretty good. Their tacos are $13 for 3. They're tasty and well worth the trip. However, my #1 choice for tacos would still be Barrio Coreano located at 642 Bloor Street West. I give Playa Cabana a solid 4-star rating because they totally deserve it. Next time, I'll make sure to check out Playa Cabana Hacienda."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Mexican cuisine. One of the best in Toronto, and probably the best for vegetarians. Wait staff that proactively stated that one of their bean options contains pork. Not very many seats, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is tiny, so definitely make a reservation. But, the atmosphere and food is great!

We've been here a couple of times, and our favourite dish is the burrito. This thing is HUGE, but I actually managed to eat all of it. It is stuffed to the brim with deliciousness, and then topped with different sauces. I couldn't tell you what the sauces are, but it's magic. The homemade chips are salty, crunchy and fresh, and make an awesome pair to the homemade guacamole. 

On our first visit, I had the ancho braised short rib brisket crispy tacos, and I wasn't a fan at all. The filling was really heavy, with no citrus or acidic flavour to contrast. The tacos were also soggy, and I couldn't eat them with my hands. We will definitely be returning for the burritos!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Nice cozy place.. Came for 24th engagement anniversary and totally satisfied... So far best Mexican place in TO.. Sure visit soon!!!"}
{"text":"awesome!!!"}
{"text":"From the reviews, I was expecting more from this restaurant. The prices were a little too high for what we got. The guacamole had no flavour. It was just mashed Avocados and it tasted like no seasoning or garlic was added. Our pitcher of Margaritas was filled with ice, hardly any alcohol and my chicken inside my enchilada was nothing special, just tasted like the rest.  The place is super small and the wait staff kept bumping into us. The customer service, however, was excellent. The food, not so much. I guess I'm going to have to continue my quest to find great Mexican food that everyone rants and raves about. I'm starting to think maybe this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant. Food is very authentic and tasty. You will not be disappointed, just be sure you make a reservation before you go, many other people know how good this place is."}
{"text":"The homemade tortilla chips are really fresh and crispy. It's really difficult to hold back from consuming baskets of them. But you MUST leave room for tacos!    

Shrimp bucket is another worthy app. Shrimps are tossed in shell in some arbol-garlic butter.They are juicy and buttery with a little kick of heat. They are a little challenging to peel and I found that a lot of the flavour was actually in the shell. The actual meat was not as flavourful as the shell. 

The braised shortrib brisket tacos are an ABSOLUTE MUST! The brisket was soooo tender and juicy with a little hint of sweet. 
 
The chorizo burrito didn't quite live up the expectations that the braised beef tacos set. It didn't pack the same level of flavour."}
{"text":"Anyone who tries to say that there is no good Mexican food to be had in Toronto has clearly never been to Playa Cabana. I adore this place. I would come back every week if I lived nearby. 

The first time I came here was on a swelteringly hot summer day. My boyfriend and I sat on the back patio and I almost believed I was actually in Mexico. I had a glass of white sangria, the \"pizza nachos\" and a veggie burrito. Sweat trickled down my face and onto my plate. It was not a proud moment for me, but I never thought that I could be so hot and so happy at the same time. Tasting fresh Oaxacan cheese was like a revelation. Seriously, after one bite of the nachos we vowed to return again as soon as possible.

We recently came back and I had a mojito, guaca fresca, and the poblano chile rellenos. As a vegetarian, I appreciate that there are other options aside from the typical \"veggie quesadillas with mixed peppers and onions\". Again, everything was absolutely delicious. Service was a bit on the slow side because there was a huge takeout order that had overwhelmed the kitchen, but our server kept checking in with us to let us know that our food would be coming out shortly. Generally, I don't mind waiting as long as it doesn't seem like we were completely forgotten about. 

The restaurant itself isn't the fanciest or the most spacious, but that's what adds to the charm! The food and the service have, on both occasions, been nothing short of excellent. Although I haven't yet been able to make a reservation (always the answering machine!), my boyfriend and I have walked in fairly early (around 5PM) and have managed to snag a table a two before the dinner rush. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Order the Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos!!! Amazingly delicious. Slap- your- mama -in- the- face good! The Ceviche is a great app, their guac is really authentic and good too. My only complaint is if you sit indoors its pretty cramped. I was elbowed in the head at least 2 times, but on the plus side the waiter was good looking. Fish tacos are a little bland. 
Decent prices too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The menu has many options to chose from, including taco trios, dinner plates and massive burritos with very generous portions. The shredded steak is amazing! The ceviche not so much. I love the vibe of this place and it's a nice break from the noisy and overly crowded taco restaurants in the downtown core. It has become my new favorite restaurant for tacos/burritos."}
{"text":"A lot of Pros/Cons to come...

Went here for a birthday dinner, and was seated inside... boy - was that a mistake.  There were only 4 of us and it was wayyy too tight! Two people literally cannot stand side by side. It was VERY hot, and very small. It is a great little hole-in-the-wall restaurant... which is literally a tiny hole in the wall.  If possible, ask to be seated outside!

The Guacamole/Salsa were great - and was a good size to share among 4 people.  Would definitely recommend. 

We ordered a number of plates to share... but to be honest, I was not blown away by their tacos.  Definitely much bigger than El Carnita - that's for sure, and MUCH better value - but the taste was pretty average. We ordered... Tacos de: Pollo al Carbon, Pescado, Carnitas.

The Mexican Street Corn is always my favourite part of these types of restaurants! Must have. 

The waiter was fantastic, and gave us a really cool run-down and lesson on types of Tequilas and Margaritas.  We were very appreciative! Loved the atmosphere... although it was a little too hot in there. 

Parking is hard to find, and it's surrounded by houses - if you're not in the area, I probably wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good, but far from great. Service is neither of those. It's unclear to me why Playa Cabana is a hotspot and why anyone should have to plan their burrito-eating a week or more in advance."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Just make sure you make reservations and show up on time! Otherwise it's a great little nook that offers very well made food, delivered to your table quickly by a polite and knowledgeable staff.

Their backyard patio (it's really a back yard hah) is actually quite nice and offers somewhat of a romantic setting on a warm day, and is great for corporate bookings and private reservations between 15-20 people.

I've been there a few times now and will definitely return.

Price is very fair.

P.S. Try the three milk cake, it's just awesome."}
{"text":"Really great authentic Mexican food. Great server. We came with two children 4 and 5 years old they liked the food too. Just be careful with the guacamole as it was spicy for children. Very tight squeeze in a small restaurant but well worth it once our food came!! Pork or fish tacos were kid friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been to many Mexican Restaurants in Canada and the USA and Playa is one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"make reservations in advance.  we went on saturday at 9:30pm and it was packed.  it's a small but cool place to bring family and friends.  

some of us had the BURRITO DE MARISCOS with the catch of the day fish, which was tilapia.  others had the veggie version.  we all  LOVED it!  keep in mind that I haven't had any mexican food aside from taco bell and burrito boyz lol.  but still this place seems very authentic.  the portions were big, although i still had room for dessert, which hit the spot.  

the dessert we had was the Tres Leche cake, which we enjoyed..

we'll be returning again.."}
{"text":"Ai-yai-yai Ole ole (these are my tequila-fueled expressions of happiness)

Playa Cabana makes you feel like you're on vacation.  A vacation to the beach, via Dupont Street.

We boldly rolled up to Playa Cabana with no reservations.  Group of 4.  One of my friends had had dreams of tacos the previous night, so we were willing to wait it out to address her subconscious culinary cravings.  While kicking around the front patio (there's little room at the bar inside, and the front patio has yet to secure a liquor license, so it was a lot of sweating, foot shuffling, and debating how hot we'd want our guacamole as we stood around) we made friends with those waiting around us.  Consensus?  Playa Cabana is worth the wait.

When we made it in (victorious!) we were led through the restaurant.  It's a tight space, and certainly not the most convenient flow.  Blame my overheated body, but A/C felt nonexistent.  Solution?  PITCHER OF MARGARITAS POR FAVOR (we opted for the tequila and orange mix).

The service was simultaneously frenetic and casual, which in a way really suited the place.  Our server was really friendly, smiled with a twinkle in his eye when we ordered the guacamole spicy (it lived up to its name) and was as attentive as he could be given the many tables and the extremely tight space (which really means, I guess: he wasn't easy to locate, but we were having so much fun that it didn't really matter).  

Food-wise we tackled the (grilled) Baja-style fish tacos and the crispy chicken tacos, rounding off the order with some churros for dessert.  

I don't know if this review's enthusiasm comes care of the tequila, but: the food was dynamite.  

The guacamole, served in a molcajete, was predominantly smooth with a few chunks and some heat.  The accompanying chips were canola oil fried house-made corn tortillas.  They were on the greasier side, but I'm saying that...as a positive thing.
The fish tacos were fresh, and light, and flavourful, with the softness of the fish set against the crunch of the slaw.
The crispy chicken tacos were messier (I had to resort to my knife and fork) but the crispy shell was the perfect complement to the soft free-range chicken
Churros, well: fried dough is alright by me.  But this was cinnamon-y, sugary, dulce de leche-kissed fried dough.  Mo' bettah.  

Worth a special note: Playa Cabana seems determined to show that Mexican food can be healthy.  Fresh salsas, locally sourced dairy, free range chicken, and black and pinto beans cooked in veggie stock (the latter are re-seared with lean pork stock so don't stay vegetarian throughout the process).  Healthy tastes delicious here.  

Yelp note: do as I say not as I do?  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go!! For comfort food or a nice date. It's small and cozy but the food is to die for. Talk about monthly cravings!"}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,

My name is Nicole, and I have been in love with this/these restaurant(s) for the past 3 years. I went for my Birthday, March 2nd, last year for my 30th. There was an unfortunate mix-up and the restaurant called an hour before my reservation to inform me that they had overbooked, and that I'd have to sit at the bar until a table became available. However, they accommodated us with a free \"Cubeta De Camaron\", which was delicious, and 20 minutes later, we were seated with lovely service.

I decided to come to Playa Cabana again for my 31st Birthday. Our reservation was for 7:30pm. Upon arriving, the host proceeded to sit us at the bar. I explained, \"I made a reservation earlier in the week for a table. Not to sit at the bar\". The host responded, \"We can sit you wherever we need to\". Slightly off-put, my significant other and I hesitatingly sat down at the bar, ordered a Dos Equis and \"Bucket Of Shrimp\", since we had enjoyed it so much last time. I asked if he'd be able to accommodate us at a table at some point. He said no, unless we wanted to wait around until 9pm. Our \"Bucket Of Shrimp\" arrived, and there were literally 8 shrimps, in a basket. My significant and I inquired with the bartender about the inconsistency from last time. Asking if they changed the menu, and why it still insinuated, \"bucket\" on the menu. The bartender knew we were getting frustrated, and spoke to the  Manager, \"Sergio\", who proceeded to literally shrug his shoulders and walk away. As somebody who works in the customer service industry, I know this was completely atrocious behavior. I told my boyfriend that I'd rather go some place else, and visited the ladies room before we left. I noticed my significant other patted the host on the back, and informed him of his great customer service (With a sarcastic undertone). While I know my partner was disgruntled with Sergio, he proceeded to accuse us of \"assault\", showed us the door, and told us we weren't welcome back, to any of the locations.

What really upsets me about these circumstances, is that I'm a pretty laid back person. I consider myself to be very understanding, and even tried to explain why I was so upset before leaving. And that my boyfriend was just standing up for me, that it was not a personal attack. My explanation was dismissed, and we were told repeatedly to \"get out\", without an apology, and without hearing us out. We were treated as if our anger was unwarranted and invalid. (Which only made us more angry) We left.

In conclusion, I had been looking forward to this Birthday dinner for months, as I don't get to come to Playa Cabana as often as I'd like. Special occasions. I tell everyone about how great this place is, and bring friends from out of town here. I know it's a busy place, probably causes quite a bit of stress for the employees, but this experience was probably the worst experience I've ever had in my life. I feel sick to my stomach, and there was no way I could not write this since I could not get a hold of another manager. The food and atmosphere at Playa Cabana is exceptional. The morale however, has proved to me, an entirely different story. Thank you for your time.


Nicole."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! And an amazing atmosphere!

Had the chicken wings which was atomic! Also had the steak burrito which was hard to resist not to lick the plate... Bartenders were really nicr and gave great drinks recommendations!"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for a good Mexican meal and seeing an Instagram picture of Playa Cabana (@PlayaCabana) burrito, it was so colorful and pretty that I just have to try it :D We arrive for a late Saturday brunch and it was still half full and I can totally expect it to be bustling in a few hours, def a neighborhood gem. When we drover by, we almost miss the place since it's nestle among other houses.

The place is rather small with a small kitchen next to the bar.

 Single Amber Agave Margarita $8
~ This was perfect, with just teh right amount of tart, sweet, salty (salt rim) and alcohol 

Ceviche of the Day $9
~ This was a bit watery and just end up being so messy when you try to scoop with the tortilla chips

 Guaca Fresca $8
~ each guac is made to order in a lava rock molcajete with spicy, medium or mild to choose from
~Of course we order spicy and that's the first time I remember we were given the choice for guac.
~ It was very creamy and bit of jalapeno peppers that just give it a pop ;)

 Taco de Pescado $13
~ Baja \"catch of the day\" fish taco w/ a Tecate-cerveza battered ($14 for non-battered/grilled fillet)
~Ben ordered this and of course he choose the battered style but I would love to try the grilled version.... oh well, next time
~ The beer battered was really thin and crispy but wish there was more of a sauce/wet component to it

 Playa Burrito $14
~ choice of chicken, veggies, ancho-braised steak and pork carnitas wrapped w/ melted Oaxacan cheese, rice, choice of beans served w/ fresh guac, pico de gallo, crema, green tomatillo sauce and red tomato sauce
~ This was what attracted me to come here and it tasted as good as it look... isn't this one of the prettiest burrito you have ever seen (at least for me).  It was a really big portion and can be easily share between 2 people after the appetizers. ~ Everything was perfect here, I got the ancho-braised steak which was recommended by our waiter and it was so soft and moist. The best part here was the green tomatillo and tomato sauce that filled the plate, you would thing that's a bit much but once you dig in you'll know it's just right

 For more heat, we were given 2 house made hot sauce : a habanera salsa & a roasted chile arboles salsa. The heat of the 1st do creep up on you which I love (I did almost finish the entire thing) while the second was more refreshing with just a tiny touch of heat.


 Verdict :
Love this place and heard they are opening a 2nd location soon
Will def go back for my next Mexican craving without hesitation
Great Portion, Great Price & Great Service"}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's birthday at Playa Cabana this year for some good Mexican eats. The restaurant is very small and popular so reservations are a must!

We had some drinks to start off the night-
Playa Paloma ($9) - a traditional Mexican margarita with Grapefruit infused Tromba blanco
Amber agave ($8) - secret house margarita made with El Jimador reposado 100% de agave, sweetened with raw organic agave nectar from the tequila plant and a splash of freshly squeezed orange juice
Mexican iced tea ($10) - Tromba blanco tequila, los Arango reposado tequila. Cazadores añeja tequila, triple sec, freshly squeeze lime, and Coca Cola
I had the Amber agave and it was, hands down, the best margarita I've had!  I really wanted to order another one, but unfortunately couldn't because I had to drive later that night.  

We started off with the guaca fresca ($8), which was absolutely delicious! It was so fresh and creamy, I just wanted to eat this all night long! The guaca fresca comes in mild, medium, and hot. We asked for mild and they gave us two types of hot sauce on the side. I enjoyed both of them, but the habanero one (on the left) was really quite spicy, even for me. The other one- a roasted chile arboles salsa- was just perfect!

tacos de pescado ($13) Baja-style with catch of the day, fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza. I can't recall what the catch of the day was, but I didn't particularly care for it. The fish wasn't as flaky and light as I'd like it to be. 

Ancho braised short rib-brisket crispy tacos ($14)- AAA Ontario Beef short rib braised in ancho chiles wrapped in fresh corn tortillas and griddled to a golden crispiness, served with pico de gallo, guacamole and homemade crema. This was definitely a heavier taco, and the flavours were also a lot bolder. The short rib-brisket combination was extremely juicy, resulting in an incredibly messy eating process (not that I'm complaining). All in all, I enjoyed the crispy taco, but it was so filling that I wouldn't be able to eat more than one.  

Playa burrito with pork carnitas ($14), served with fresh guac, pico de gallo, crema, green tomatillo sauce and red tomato sauce. I'm not a big fan of  burritos in general, but I've read so many great reviews about the ones here that I was sorely tempted to try one. First of all, I thought the presentation was so pretty with the two contrasting sauces. Secondly, the portion was huge- our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomach! I was intimidated by the sheer massiveness of all the that pork, rice and beans- it was almost like a brick. In the end, Mel and I struggled to finish the whole burrito, and neither of us liked the green tomatillo sauce that much. To be fair, this was probably a very good burrito, but it was just not for me

Because it was a birthday celebration, we obviously had to have dessert! First up, an order churros ($6). Unfortunately, I didn't love this version, as the dough was a little too dense and   the flavours were lacking a punch because they ran out of the cajeta dipping sauce.

The second dessert was a traditional Mexican flan ($7), and while it didn't look very pretty, the flavours certainly made up its looks. The flan was velvety smooth and rich, and even the side of whipped cream was delectable!

I really enjoyed dinner at Playa Cabana. The drinks were excellent, and I'd come back just for the guaca fresca! Though next time, I'd probably stay away from the burrito."}
{"text":"Decided to be festive and celebrate cinco de mayo this year and found/chose Playa cabana based on Blog TO & yelp reviews.

The place is small and quaint, but is very popular in the evening creating a very tight space. However I could look past that because the food is amaaaaazing! My boyfriend and I ordered drinks, snapper ceviche, chorizo tacos & short rib tacos and finished off with churros. It was truly a love at first bite! At first I was worried about portions, as everything look small on yelp, however food was soo filling! The staff was warm and welcoming however they were not as attentive as they should've been. They were quick to seat us & say hello but didn't take initiative to check on their tables, instead most servers were huddled around the bar just socializing. This caused quite a waiting game when I was in need for water or when we wanted to order our mains & dessert. I'd only hope the service is better the next time."}
{"text":"Hard to find a worthy rival for Mexican food in the city.  

The outdoor patio is relaxed and tucked away in a quiet neighborhood.   The service is attentive but it is, as often sited, difficult to get reservations."}
{"text":"Place is a small neighborhood gem. Food is all handmade, fresh and delicious. Place hold 50 inside, with an additional patio in nice weather. Service is attentive unless they are packed.

Worth visiting if you're nearby, but it's not a destination by itself."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last night for the second and last time. The food was okay, but the service and attitude of staff ensured I will not be back. 

My boyfriend and I came a couple of weeks ago, ordered burritos and drinks, and we're genuinely satisfied with our meal. 

Last night was different. There seemed to be some confusion about which server had our table because we had two come up to us. The one who ended up serving us was either very rude or seriously lacking social skills; but people in the service industry shouldn't struggle with that. My boyfriend asked if he could get the password for wifi or if all of their (numerous) networks were for staff. She answered \"no.\" Uhhh what? How about \"no sorry, unfortunately it's just for staff\" or something to that effect? Very bizarre. 

I ordered the veggie burrito, as I had last time, and the waitress mentioned that the rice is cooked with chicken stock, so would I like it without rice? I was surprised because the server we had the first visit never mentioned this. As a vegetarian, I expect that kind of information to be on the menu or at least communicated verbally. Rice is normally cooked in water, so I didn't even think to ask if they cooked it with any kind of meat. 

So I ordered a burrito sans rice. I wasn't thrilled, but I also wasn't going to leave because of it, my stomach was talking to me. I opened up my napkin wrapped silverware and found food residue on the fork and what looked like sauce on the napkin. I told the waitress and she brought me a new set. 

We then asked to speak to the manager. The manager basically tried to put it on me that they cook the rice the way they do. He said \"well now you'll know for next time.\" I've never managed a restaurant, but even I know you respond by saying \"thanks for drawing that to my attention, I'll look into putting it on the menu.\" He spoke very incoherently. I honestly felt like I was talking to a teenager. I understand he may not have the authority to change the menu, but his response to me shouldn't have been what it was. 

And with the silverware, he grabbed the new set I had been given and said he'd bring me a new one. That new one never came, so we had to ask another server who was setting the table next to ours. 

Overall, I was very disappointed in the experience. I don't expect perfection, as mistakes do happen, but what counts is how the mistake is remedied, and this place did a very poor job."}
{"text":"Small but mighty!

This location is one of a few that are owned by the same chain.

The food is great, not as much of a selection as Playa Cabana Hacienda but still the food is equally as good. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food and some good drinks, this is your place.

Make a reservation or you may run the risk of not getting in!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Cozy and tiny, great vibe and great food. I've been there a few times and it's easily one of my favorites in the city. 
You just have to make sure that you make reservations before you go because it's seriously really tiny."}
{"text":"Hoooly Cabana the food is awesome here!! The guacamole and nachos. Oh heavens me. Tasted amazing. Loveddd their enchiladas. The food is delicious and the portions are generous. Huge fan."}
{"text":"A great place to visit if coming to Toronto for the first time. This place is so good they made two right down the street from each other. There both pretty small so trying to walk in wont work and calling right before you won't work either. But the people are friendly and always ask what the recommend because there are some pretty crazy good dishes! It's reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I love love love Playa! I've never had a bad experience here. Everything that I have ordered on the menu has been delicious! Service is always quick and courteous. My personal favourite on the menu is the chicken tinga tacos!"}
{"text":"We've been there for dinner couple of time with a group of friends and every time its a win.  The food is great, the atmosphere is very cool, the booze is there, customer service is phenomenal and overall its a great place to have catch-up dinners with your besties."}
