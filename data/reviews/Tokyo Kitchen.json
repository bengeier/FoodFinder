{"text":"A great little Japanese place with sushi as well as tempura and donburi. Outdoor seating available.  Very polite servers and the sashimi was fresh. I did wait a while to get my food, but that might have been because 2 parties ordered right in front of me."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it has always been so delicious and authentic!! Sad news - the restaurant is closed for a year for renovations starting Dec 31!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!! THE WORST JAPANESE RESTAURANT EVER!!!  I order a box Sashimi (salmon and tuna) alone with some other food to go. The Sashimi was not firm, watery, smells and taste extra fishy. For sashimi like this, it should be through away, not serve to a take-out meal, and hoping that I will let it go!!! I went back to the restaurant and the restaurant staff would not admit the fish is not fresh. I asked the chef to talk to me, and the chef cowardly hide behind the kitchen and did not willing to redo a fresh sashimi. It's a shame how this restaurant run! Japanese restaurant to me usually means integrity and quality of food, and this restaurant  totally failed it! Because I ate most part of the first piece sashimi, I later had upset stomach, and I have complained to the Food Service Inspection."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday, quiet and relax place.  Tried the curry with pork cutlet and vegetables, spicy level 7.   Great food and lovely environment!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time in years.  This place no longer has ramen on the menu so i don't see a reason for going back.  Who actually likes Udon??"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food, great service, and CLEAN.  Coming from Vancouver - land of many Japanese restaurants. This authentic Japanese restaurant has some of my all time favourites.  Katsu Curry, Takoyaki, and Coquettes.  My go to place for some Japanese comfort food."}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu curry. The best I had so far in Vegas since moving here.  You can even choose the level of spicy which is good for me since I can't handle.   Very clean and good vibes   Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Uhhhh, no bathroom. What?  Not much of a sushi restaurant, more non-sushi Japanese cuisine.  But seriously? No bathroom?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Japanese home-style food. I'm gonna warn you ahead of time that this is a no frills, lowkey lunch/dinner spot with excellent food. I come here to eat after a long day of work by myself and it always hits the spot. Only bring people who share the sentiment on good food--this is not a glamorous first date, it's a simple and earnest place for companions to enjoy quiet jazz and the sound of slurp slurp.   There is a bathroom in the building complex. Ask for the key and walk around into the parking lot. It's the second door from the parking security.   My go-to is the tempura udon--perfectly crisp tempura with just the right amount of batter, and wide assortment of vegetables. The ten-don with katsu is the best deal on the menu. You can never go wrong with the una-don, absolutely delicious every time. The sashimi is also fresh and portioned well. I always have a hard time deciding what to eat.   This is where to go for authentic Japanese food. If I had to complain about anything, the waitresses are a little forgetful but cute nonetheless."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is Toronto Japanese food getting better? Japanese run, and is just a meal done right. Kind of hidden away, but go find it!"}
{"text":"I have only tried their sushi roll. Food is very simple, but good- authentic is the right word. But it didn't blow my socks off or anything, and I didn't feel it was that special. Very clean, and good service.   Portions are much smaller than other places, which is just so Japanese. Prices are ok, some items can be more pricey than other places, given the small portions.   There is no washroom inside the resto, but they will provide a key and you gotta go elsewhere...I take a star off for not being able to provide the most basic thing that even some of the sketchiest food places have!  For me, it was 3 or 3.5 stars. If you're looking for affordable authentic Japanese, this is a good place."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Japanese curry. I had the pork katsu with Kurobuta sausage and spicy level 3. Had a really strong kick and the curry itself was the best I've had in town. I'll be coming back to try other items!"}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing at Tokyo Kitchen!  My favourite dish is the pork katsu curry and it's my favourite that I've had outside of Japan."}
{"text":"Superb sashimi and seaweed salad.. Real Japanese and my favourite in town. The location is a bit bland but at the end of the day the only thing that counts is the good food oh no? Real deal!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on a quiet Charles Street, Tokyo Kitchen is a Japanese owned restaurant which serves simple casual Japanese food. It is consistently good. My friend and I ordered the Ten-katsu Don and the Curry Pork Katsu, Tokyo Kitchen specializes in fried food and never fails to disappoint with its lightly breaded and crunchy pork cutlets and tempura. The Japanese curry possess great depth in flavours from the many hours of stewing and tastes amazing with rice. The tempura brings out the fresh flavours of shrimp and the variety of vegetables and always great for a post-gym meal."}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch here recently. Lots of bento box options that are very reasonably priced. As an appetizer we got  the tofu with green onion and bonito flakes -- perfect for a scorching day, with a shared large bottle of Japanese beer.   After trying most of the other Japanese spots in the area, this does seem a cut above the others (especially since our favorite one on Yorkville was replaced by KOKO which we Do Not Like)."}
{"text":"Tokyo Kitchen, located at Charles St. E. x Yonge St (2 blocks south of Yonge x Bloor), is one of my favourite Authentic Japanese restaurants. I have been a regular for almost a decade. I must say that they make the Best Deep-fried Japanese dishes (karaage, tempura, Chicken/Pork katsu) in Toronto. They are also reasonably priced! Student friendly :)  The owners have been specializing in deep-fried dishes for over 20 years. Before they opened Tokyo Kitchen, they had a delicatessen specializing in deep-fried dishes.  My recommendations are:  *Chicken/Pork Katsu, and Omelette curry *Tempura"}
{"text":"TK is awesome for take-out as I live close by.  Their sashimi are always fresh-tasting, and other cooked option foods are prepared with what seems like real ingredients.  I find cooking style to be nostalgic, thus, I really enjoy having the more \"comfort food\"-type items such as Katsu Don and any of the curry dishes.  Beware if eating in, though; it seems that the ventilation in the restaurant is insufficient and so you will come out smelling like you've been by the deep-fryer all day."}
{"text":"I would say their tempura udon and curry is the best in town.    Their tempura udon is definitely my must have whenever we visit.  The huge basket of tempura has 3 shrimps and many veg, they even have okra and lotus root sometimes!  Udon noodles are cooked to the perfect texture.  My husband's favourite is their pork katsu curry.  The pork cutlets have a very thin crispy crust, complimented with Japanese curry made from beef.  The only things made it short from 5 star rating are the poor ventilation that made my hair and clothes smell like grease after the meal and their recent cut down on pork cutlet portion."}
{"text":"I have walked by Tokyo Kitchen many times since I have started volunteering across the street at Sanctuary (homeless shelter). I have always noted the cute ambiance and the interesting looking menu. Finally, I managed to sneak off work to come all the way uptown to have a meal here. My verdict: MMMMM! TK has amazing home style comfort food! I really recommend their fried dishes over everything else - I think that they have mastered the art of tempura frying. Seriously.   If you take a look at my pics, you will see that I tried the  1) Croquette - yummy! The sauce is perfect and the batter is perfect and the potato stuffing is perfect. Just perfection all around!   2) Chicken Katsu with Egg Corn - Delicately seasoned and again, fried perfectly. The corn egg makes the chicken a little mushy at the end of the meal ... but you know what, that is a given.   3) Lunch Special A - Hello TEMPURA! This is the highlight of the dish ... we had so many different kind of vegetables (yam / eggplant / lady finger etc) and TWO shrimp. The rolls and salad were ok (tho a little small in size). The teriyaki could have a much better kick to the sauce. But overall, I was so pleased with the tempura that I overlooked the other little mishaps.  The service was impeccable (constant refills with a smile). The d√©cor is so charming and tranquil. Yes, I will come by .. often. For the fried goodies. :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go when I miss my country's food. Their food is truly authentic and tasty. There are plenty of Japanese restaurants in Toronto, however, it is rare to find real taste cooked by a Japanese chef like this restaurant. Tokyo Kitchen has \"Teshoku\" style which is combination of a main dish, just-cooked rice, hot miso soup and simple salad served on different plates. As I am familiar with Teshoku style than Bento box style, this is an asset to me.  While it is hard for most Japanese restaurant to serve just and well-cooked rice, they always serve perfectly well cooked rice! Another significant element of my recommendation is that they have a welcome atmosphere to a single customer. I go there whenever I feel craven to have real Japanese food :)"}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was very nice. The decor of the restaurant was unique and they even play Japanese music. The pork cutlet was very crispy and the curry itself was very rich. The fried oyster was also good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Good curry!! Portion sizes are big and the curry is flavorful. Level 20 spicy is prefect if you like spicy curry.  Looks like Zen might have some competition! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Sashimi is fresh and thick-cut. Their donburi, noodles in soup, and curries are great. the food is simple, nothing fancy, but everything I've had so far is definitely tasty. It's a small restaurant, and often filled when I walk past in the evenings. Sadly, there's currently a sign on their door saying that they're going to be closed for a while due to building renovations. Hope they open soon again as I'd love to try some of their lunch specials."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is bright,clean and warm. The waitress is so cute and friendly. The restaurant is owned by Japanese and they are all super warm hearted. I ordered the pork curry rice and Ikura side dish. I am not  a fan of curry, so it is delicious but It did not surprise me. I really love Ikura, but with the radish is kind of sour. The food is fair good. But I really really love this quit white place."}
{"text":"Place was decorated pretty nicely. When we sat down they never offered water and kept talking amongst themselves even thought we've been ready to order for a good 8 min. Didn't have anything available that was on the menu so I went with just curry. I figured, you can't fuck up curry right? Man I was so wrong. The food tasted really bad. They probably just bought some packaged curry from the store and heat it up. You know what never mind packaged curry would've tasted better I would never come back again."}
{"text":"In the space of where Kaba curry used to be is Tokyo Kitchen. My normal space for japanese curry is zen which is across the street, so i went with something new.  The first thing you will notice is the furniture and layout. its very cafe-like and clean. its 2pm on saturday and its calm. it feels like a small retreat from the normal chinatown hustle. the menu is a bit smaller than other places, but that is not always bad. i did notice chicken katsu missing, but there is always trusty pork katsu. i wanted to try okonomiyaki but it was crossed off the menu. the curry was delicious, but there was a slight difference than other curries. perhaps a different base.  the attention to plating really does make it feel like from tokyo. for dessert i had a chocolate banana parfait. the contents were sliced banana, vanilla ice cream, frosted flakes, whipped cream, and crumbled chocolate cake and  chocolate syrup and a chocolate pirouette. altogether very good. i will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Japanese places in Toronto. Katsu Don is the best in town.  Tempura/Ten Don is always well battered, crispy, and tender. I don't recommend having sashimi or sushi here though.  Service is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Sashimi is fresh and my husband enjoyed the eel bento box. Service is a little slow, I think they need more wait staff. Wish the tea was free (they charge $1)."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was recommend by our friend and we were looking for a new place to enjoy Japanese food. The prices were good for the portion. We had the omelette rice and the Japanese tradition pasta. Which was really good and will get again when we come back. Also that the Japanese pasta did take a little longer than the rice, but the waitress did let us know. Also she was very nice and even took our picture. This place is super cute and has good food."}
{"text":"Very small place, busy on a Saturday evening.  Japanese-owned and operated.  Even the servers are Japanese.  Standard Japanese menu but very well done.  Decent portions too.  The green tea was the tea bag variety--not very good.  The washroom is not in the restaurant.  You have to leave the restaurant to find it.  Our two Japanese friends said this is the real deal.  We will return."}
{"text":"authentic Japanese Comfort food!  I'm Japanese and Tokyo Kitchen is my Go-To Place !"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese feel. Ordered a chicken katsu curry ($11.95) and a cold sake ($5.95). The katsu's got the nice crispy outside, portion size is not bad. Lots of curry to go with it. Sake is cheap for how much you get."}
{"text":"Fortunate enough to work in the area, I come here whenever I have a chance. Everything is so good here, it's hard to pick a favourite. I love the tempura and even eat the veggie ones that I normally wouldn't eat, just because it's that good! The fish is fresh and the curry & donburi here is great, it's quite hard to pick what to eat every time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for my homey japanese food cravings in the last 2 years. The first time I came, I was very satisfied with the authentic taste. However, lately I have been noticing the smaller portion and the change in taste. This is most noticeable in the curry. Gone was the dark brown umami curry due to beef stock. Now, the curry is very bland if eaten with rice because they change the beef stock with water. Will I come again? Honestly I don't know. With the same price and the diluted curry, I might as well go up north to J-Town for a one day trip and have real homey japanese food."}
{"text":"Had the beef teriyaki lunch special today. Beef was dry and chewy. Spring roll was average. Salad was a few pieces of lettuce and one tomato that were soggy from being placed in the same box as the beef. Would not return."}
{"text":"I personally really like curry and if you are the same with me. This would be the place to go. Before writing this review I was going to add a photo with it as well, but it was just too good that I didn't have a chance to stop and take a photo before I finished my curry. Definitely come and try.   P.s. The environment here is great too. I really liked the coffee shop kinda feeling inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tokyo Kitchen has a modern, comfortable feel to it. The waitress greeted us with a smile and was on top of her game. So far so good! I ordered the tuna salad and  fried oyster curry. Oh my god, my food was so delicious! I'm definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here. I've seen a few friends post snaps so I thought I'd try myself since I go to other curry restaurant quite often. Off the bat, the space is very clean and stylish. I applaud whoever designed the space because I love the use of different furnishings. It created a laid back environment to come with friends or even a date. The food was really good. It did take some time, but I didn't mind. That may have been the only downside. The curry had a lot of flavor and I liked that it was on the runny side. Lastly, the server was very welcoming and courteous. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Out of the Japanese places in the hood, this is a great lunch spot if you are craving something not just sushi.  This place is actually Japanese run and the menu is packed with authentic offerings.  Japanese curry is probably the most popular dish.  It smelled great, sweet, thick, rich, warm, and tasted delicious.  There wasn't very much meat.  This was offset by the really awesome potato croquettes.  It wouldn't have been nearly as good without the crispy croquettes which added something extra to a rather simple dish.  They have sushi specials which they post on the wall. My friend had the special which was fresh and tasty. But the rolls are small.    We were both still hungry after, so if you have a healthy appetite, you will have to order some sides.  Overall, it's a great spot and the quality of sushi is better than other places nearby.  I will go for the soba next time.  Not really a dinner place, but Tokyo Kitchen is great place for a casual Tokyo lunch."}
{"text":"I went there for their dinner special.  It was sooooo good.  I chose the salmon teriyaki option with shrimp and veggie tempura.  One of the best places for tempura which included okra, asparagus, kombocha squash and shrimp...  Excellent...  My only qualm would be that their salmon teriyaki portion was kinda' on the small side.  If I had it again I would ask for 2 pieces. And I can't seem to walk away from this restaurant without having some unagi."}
{"text":"The curry was amazing. I had to order extras everything. The deserts are very good too."}
{"text":"Tokyo Kitchen is a new restaurant that has taken over the old Kaba Curry place in Chinatown. After walking in, the dining room has a more upscale feel to it than its previous incarnation. I particularly like the chairs in this place, they are super comfy.  Looking at the menu, it looks like they are going for a casual Japanese cafe type food with a focus on curries, vegetable bowls, appetizers including okonomiyaki, and desserts. After ordering from the friendly server, I waited.  The food took an abnormally long time to come out. It was about 25 minutes after I ordered, and I was the only person in the restaurant.  The okonomiyaki came first, after taking a few bites, I sent it back because it was barely above room temperature. When it came back, the chef just took the one I sent back, and heated it up so it was burnt on the bottom.   The Katsu Curry wasn't a success as well. I kept hearing a microwave go off, and I thought that was odd. When my dish came, I understood why. The pork was tough as rubber and was separating from the overcooked panko crust, and was watery. I ate half because I was trying to figure out why it tasted so weird. The curry tasted average and the rice tasted like it had been sitting in a holder for half the day. Fortunately, the server didn't charge me for the okonomiyaki.  I gave an extra star because my server was really nice and pleasant. But the food is poorly prepared."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, curry is very authentic and makes me feel like I'm in Japan. The atmosphere when dinning in is very positive and upbeat with friendly staff. My wife and I come here all the time and try new foods and they have not disappointed us."}
{"text":"The newly opened Tokyo Kitchen offers something special to Toronto. Succulent Tendon paired with a fragrant Katsudon really brings the experience to life. I would highly recommend an order of Dragon Sushi rolls to go with your main dish.  All in all, a really great place and I'm so glad to have it back in the heart of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant- quick, friendly service tasty food, and reasonable prices. We had the beef curry with shrimp and beef noodle udon soup- both were exactly as expected. Will definitely be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Really good and traditional Japanese curry.Professional and clean.   The chairs are beautiful, I like the chairs here, it is comfort. U can also try the dessert, Japanese style, cute and yummy."}
{"text":"I can't sing enough praises about Tokyo Kitchen! The menu here features mostly traditional, homestyle type meals that I haven't really seen anywhere else. Stuff like Japanese-style curry, croquettes, donburi, karaage, etc. are what make this place completely unique and awesome. They do of course have the typical fare (sushi, gyoza, edamame, teriyaki, etc) that you'd find in most Japanese restaurants here, all of which are equally delicious. :3  My favourite dish here is the Japanese-style curry. I keep meaning to try more from the menu but I just can't seem to pull away from the deliciousness that is beef curry or curry with croquettes. The karaage was also super delicious. The sushi is also really fresh and like everyone else says, is served in smaller sizes that seems to be more traditional and easier to eat. Heck, even their \"regular\" menu items like the gyoza, miso soup, tempura, yakitori, etc... they're all amazingly delicious here.  Another point worth mentioning is that this is an authentic Japanese restaurant, owned and staffed by Japanese people. There are plenty of Japanese customers that come in and you're pretty much guaranteed to hear several conversations in Japanese over dinner. The service is also really fantastic, as all the waitresses are very quick to refill your glasses and are very polite and friendly. The restaurant was recently renovated (in 2009 I think) and the only thing that's changed aside from the decor is that all ramen seems to have been removed from the menu. There may be one or two other things missing but that was the big thing for me, as their ramen was amazing.  And on a final note, yes, their washroom is located outside of the restaurant itself. I've never had to use it but I think it's either in the parking lot or in the breakfast place located next door."}
{"text":"Good Japanese diner. The food is simple, clean and decent. Patio seats are lovely during summer, the inside of this diner smells very very smoky and greasy, if you come here with a decent jacket, you'd better   Watch out because you might smell like been deep fried after you walk out of this diner."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food. Cozy. Good dinner.   Pretty flowers! 6 Stars for the waitresses."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of its value for money. It offers very good quality food for  low prices.   I had the Katsu Curry Chicken which was cooked to perfection. The curry sauce that comes with it was different from what I'm used to but I liked it a lot. Salad and rice were good.  They offer japanese imported beers (Kirin Ichiban, Sapporo etc) starting at $4.4/bottle and have a very relaxing patio."}
{"text":"just because they dont have a restroom in the dining area doesnt warrant 4 stars.   seriously, i love this place. the ambiance is unpretentious. the clientele actually includes japanese expats and students. and it's the few places in toronto that i can get a GOOD oyakodon or katsukaredon. in fact, it's one of the only spots in toronto that reminds me that you CAN get good authentic japanese food.   p.s. no offence, but i'm feeling \"ventish\".stop saying you like japanese if you order anything teriyaki"}
{"text":"So glad that Tokyo Kitchen has finally reopened!!  It was worth the wait.  We ordered 6 dishes. The top were:  pork katsu curry, corn creamy korokke, salmon don, and tempura!  We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is our second time here and we will continue coming back. They're always friendly and the food here is awesome!!! It's a must try and their curry is bomb plus their decor is so cute and inviting."}
{"text":"It's a cute little kitchen upstairs from swish shabu shabu in that one plaza with the Asian market. They recently opened and if you take a pic with their IG board frame and post it on IG or FB you can get free dessert YAAAS!! So I took advantage lol.  The food was cute it wasn't exquisite or anything it's just simple curry, but the way they present your food is super cute! The portions also look like kinda small at first but it REALLY fills you up. I got the spaghetti omelette, it tasted kinda sweet but it was really good. My friend ordered the pork cutlet lvl 10 spicy and his mouth was on fire LOL. And there was this other one it was like beef curry or something? That one was probably THE BEST.  Once you're done I recommend getting dessert like I MEAN IT. Everything on their menu was delicious. If you get the chocolate banana ice cream, the presentation of it is TOO CUTE and really delicious too. And there was this green tea one with Mochi and red bean? That was my other favorite too. This place is worth a try, it's too cute and the service was really attention and kind."}
{"text":"The GF and I walk by this place all the time, we finally decided to give it a try after reading up on the generally favorable reviews on Yelp.  I'd like to start off by saying this place is really hard to find.  There aren't any real indications on the outside that it's a Japanese restaurant.  No sign flippers or big pictures of their menu on display.  Just look out for the many people on the patio eating curry bowls and sashimi!  The food is good, not good enough to speed dial home to your mom and tell her you're taking her here next mothers day though.  You can tell the food is made with care and by actual Japanese chefs in the back.  How do I know this you ask?  Well I heard them speaking Japanese to each other!  I had the Pork Katsu Curry dish and the GF went with the salmon sashimi.  Both were made quick and came out fresh.  Only problem though, the portions were a bit small.  So small that I went to red bench after to gorge on ice cream sandwiches because I was still hungry.  They take credit card surprisingly as most of these types of places are cash only, so that was a plus.  A brother has to collect his air miles knowmsayin?  Service was a bit slow, but they were pretty friendly.  Expect to drop about $50 for a small dinner for 2 at this place, knowing you will be hungry after.  Overall, I'd come back here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice for Japanese in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I knew we should've ordered anything but the sushi...  We had the party tray which came with 4 types of rolls and 8 pieces of sushi.  It was ok, nothing special.  A little too much rice used in the rolls.  Service was friendly, but very slow.  Where are the washrooms?"}
{"text":"Food is good - Authentic and Fresh , but nothing special. Service is superb.   Lack of washroom may cause some inconvenience."}
{"text":"Amazing service. I asked if they had a beef bowl, the server said they don't but could ask the chef if he could make it and they were able to make it which was so sweet and amazing of them to do. It's the best beef bowel I've had and I didn't get charged extra for ordering something that's off the menu which was amazing . I was very impressed and satisfied. It's a small restaurant so it's kind of a hidden gem it is without a doubt worth checking out. The only down fall is because it's smaller there's no washroom so if your going there make sure to use a bathroom before going or just know you'll have to hold it!"}
{"text":"Tried their Fried Oyster Curry twice, and I love the oysters. They're big and juicy. The curry is not bad.  I waned to order coffee and try out their coffee machine. However, the server said the restaurant owner forgot to buy coffee beans... The interior decoration looks like a high class coffee and dessert place. LoL"}
{"text":"This place is not opened yet. Probably not opened until February March 2018 at least."}
{"text":"Went on soft opening for dinner  Venue (4): Still under construction but looks promising. Cute design reminiscent of a cafe in Tokyo. Outdoor patio on side street makes it a great place to stop by in the summer.   Service (4): Friendly & attentive albeit a bit forgetful. Waitresses are Japanese with limited English skills, but they try their best.   Food - Taste/Texture/Appearance (2): Ordered katsu-curry. Simple home-made style curry roux, the kind you can buy from a grocery store and make by adding water. No other vegetables added, which is common in a katsu-curry in Japan so no big issues on the curry itself given context. However, they neglected to add any pickled vegetables, which is needed to offset the richness. Instead they opted for a plain salad with no dressing and a potato salad.  As for the katsu, the meat was overcooked despite them opting for the thicker style of katsu and the skin was falling off due to poor breading technique.   Food - Value (1): The disappointing katsu-curry was vastly overpriced for what was provided at $16 before tax and tip.   Drink (n/a): Only ordered water. Strange that as a restaurant they don't offer tea. Also did not see any special drinks on menu but there was a soft opening $5 Asahi beer, which I did not purchase.   Overall verdict (11/20)   Recommendation to restaurant:  1. Number the menus sequentially instead of using the letter/# codes, so that waitresses can use those to take orders. 2. Either increase the quality of the food or lower the price. Can't have it both ways and expect the store to survive for long if the food quality is sub-par."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cute little cafe because just like everyone else in Toronto, I will try any restaurant that uses the words \"Japan\", \"Tokyo\" or any other cute Japanese sounding words in their name (90% of Torontonians). Food was mediocre at best with absurd prices. Not sure if they're trying to cover the costs of being out of operation for so long with the renovation on top. Every entree on their brunch menu is 15-20 dollars. Their tiny rolls that look like someone who decided to make sushi at home for the first time are 10. Their curry portion size is comical. Just go hit up mr donkatsu for the price you're paying since it's the same. Definitely not worth unless you're the type of person who devotes their life on getting likes on IG even though their presentation isn't great.   Tempura don is 14.99. Tempura itself is 9.90. You're paying a markup of 5 dollars for a bowl of rice with no additional sides. But it's totally worth it for the presentation."}
{"text":"Located near yonge and bloor this cute little place offers simple yet authentic Japanese food. I have tried most of there food but will highly recommend the chicken katsu curry. Trust me these guys do the best japanese curry."}
{"text":"Don't let the casual dinning room fool you - Tokyo Kitchen is definitely a cut above most Japanese restaurants.  There are alternatives to the same old sushi here that are really wonderful, fresh and well presented (see photo).  Take a slurp of miso and you find yourself saying \"Wow, this miso is much better than most\".  Try some rice on its own and you realize it's the best rice ever.  It's just noticeably better than at most places.  For bento box, I still prefer Sushi Delight on Danforth, where both the grilled beef and the tempura are better, but when you want to break from the normal Japanese fare, this place stands out.   I get the impression that regulars linger here long after their meal, so it's comfortable and not rushed."}
{"text":"Excellent pork/sausage combo curry ! French toast with ice cream, strawberries, banana with chocolate syrup ! All tasty ! Will be back with friends !"}
{"text":"Love their pork katsu curry!!! One of my absolute favorite places for lunch around yonge and bloor. The overall feel of the restaurant is quaint and relaxing and the hostesses are all so nice and friendly. Food is authentic and delicious. The only thing I would complain about is the prices aren't cheap, and some of the sushi rolls are a little expensive... I'd stick with a 'sushi' place for sushi, like wow sushi, japango, etc. But the outstanding parts of this place is definitely the other Japanese food items people overlook! Definately check it out."}
{"text":"I've always thought of the Charles St. parking garage solely as the location where I've spent far too many hours of my life climbing up and down the numerous floors, wondering where on God's green earth people have decided to creatively park car2gos instead of their clearly designated location. Now that I've discovered Tokyo Kitchen, it will be the above plus Tokyo Kitchen.  We ordered a Bento Box ($10.95), Salmon Donburi ($12.95) and, by mistake of assuming it was complimentary, a cup of tea ($1).  The food was really good - I wish they gave you more of it! Shrimp teriyaki = 2 shrimp. 2 pieces of sushi, 2 pieces of maki. The tempura was FABULOUS, thankfully, because that was pretty much it for the bento. Salmon don was delicious too, but simple as donburi goes. I could eat that every day.  Prices were just too high compared to nearby options (which come with sides, too). I'd return if they were lower for lunch or if the portions were bigger."}
{"text":"Delicious and homemade! Fresh ingredients and it's authentic Japanese food! They have the most amazing croquettes here. Its not a good place for sushi but if you like home style Japanese food like curry, udon or tonkatsu, they do it well here."}
{"text":"Gem in the area! Been going here since university days and it never fails to impress. The curry here is bomb and overall Japanese dishes are quite authentic. Service is nice and quality of food is always consistent. I'll definitely keep coming!"}
{"text":"Too expensive. I had lunch bento box A ($10) and came out really hungry. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"It's... an OK place to eat for lunch if you don't care about the price. Main dishes are noodles (udon or soba), donburi and beef curry.  I had the korokke curry since others here recommended it. My friend also had it. We are in agreement that it is OK but we've had better and not quite worth the price.   The curry itself is possibly homemade or rather it isn't made from any japanese curry roux I've tried (ie. House or Glico), however it does contain an amount of msg as I have a sensitive stomach towards msg. The beef is pretty dry and of low grade akin to stewing beef. The rice is japanese and cooked well. The korokke is really very good and it almost justifies the price.  If I were to go again, I'd probably get donburi because as I mentioned above, the rice and the korokke were the best parts of the dish. However, for udon and japanese curry I still think that Manpuku has the best in Toronto.  Oh, it's also worth mentioning that the place isn't very big but the seating and decor is nice."}
{"text":"So darn good! I have never eaten sushi in Vancouver...but friends from Van advise that this was the closest they have had to Van Sushi place in Toronto.   Friday night saw a trip to this fine place. I would go as far to say it has probably been the best sushi I have had in T.O. So delicious and fresh. I had the sushi and sashimi combo and some vegetable tempura, loved it all. Be prepared for a fair amount of food, portions are huge. Few friends had katsu curry...portions looked really big. Sushi and sashimi dinner comes with soup and salad.  The platter looked amazing and was beautifully presented. The waitresses were helpful and friendly, very attentive and service was quick.   Plus they do takeout...get in!  The restaurant was so quiet which meant our table for 10 were easily seated, on a Friday night this was really good. Being this quiet I was a bit apprehenisve however I certainly was not disappointed in the slightest!   Sushi and Sashimi dinner...just do it!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, close to work, good service, authentic Japanese food - absolutely lovely.    Recommended for: work lunch, dates, catch-up with old friends Not recommended for: people who love AYCE sushi.    The portion sizes are reasonable, but they aren't huge, so if you are used to huge portions of cheaper quality sushi or AYCE sushi, you'll probably be disappointed.    I've had chicken teriyaki and meat croquettes from this place and it was good.  On my last visit with a co-worker, I had the vegetable bento box (though I'm not a vegetarian) and it was good and unique.  California rolls, salad, tempura, agedashi tofu and rice for $10.95 (I think I'm missing something here...I forget).  What I loved was that the tempura had some unique items such as okra and lotus.  You don't have those too often.    The agedashi (fried) tofu was also cooked perfectly.  I think this is a great place for a date, catching up, but it's not a place to stuff your stomach as much as you can.  Great place to visit once a month or so."}
{"text":"Order: Karage, Croquet Curry, Shrimp Fry Curry, Tempura Soba  This the perfect spot for a small business meeting over dinner, catching up with a friend over a meal, or simply dining alone.  This place has just gone under renovation as well, so most of the interior has just been redone.  The waitresses are courteous and helpful too.  They'll even give you the time of day to chat with you if you'd like - one older man did during my dine in experience and it was quite entertaining.  Anyway, the menu they have is extensive, filled with traditional Japanese appetizers and meals.  Sometimes that's not necessarily a good sign, but having had a small variety of their dishes, I was quite impressed.  The curry was flavorful and the fried sides were juicy and delicious.  My favorite though was the karage.  The soba noodles were great too, some of the best I've had outside of Japan.  Having lived in Tokyo myself, this place brought back pleasant memories to my taste buds.  Overall it wasn't food I would die without, though I may kill for it every now and then if I lived in the area.  Marketing itself as a typical Tokyo kitchen, it definitely gets the \"Tokyo kitchen\" part right, yet is far from typical in comparison to the other Japanese places out there.  [Pros] + clean, quaint dining space + fair price for pretty good food in pretty good portions + fairly large menu including many authentic Japanese appetizers  [Recommendation] + Karage"}
{"text":"Bestie was in town and so my search for very inexpensive, legit Japanese food began. Thanks to a friend, she lead me to Tokyo Kitchen.  ---------------- If you're planning to celebrate a milestone, TK may not be the place to do it, but if you need a quick, cheap Japanese bite ... TK does the trick. ----------------  This establishment is conveniently located just 2 block away from Bloor Station. The menu is pretty extensive. I wasn't completely blown away and wouldn't make an effort to come back, but if you're in the area and want Japanese food, why not?"}
{"text":"The interior design is cute and quirky. Very quiet with nice mellow music. I went in hoping for Oknomiyaki but they do not serve that anymore. Ended up getting the omurice. Omurice was savory and very good. The plates were decorative and pretty as well. Water tastes fresh and infused with lemon. They also have a cute Polaroid heart that is the center of attention for the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is delicious. We tried their curry dishes and desserts. Both yummy!"}
{"text":"This place has room for improvement but I'm not sure if I'll be coming back anytime soon. I like the interior, I like what they have on the menu, I like how it's clean and I like how the employees are super friendly.  But how can someone run a restaurant and not be able to keep simple functions of the store maintained? I came to try the curry with pork cutlet but the first time I came, their fryer wasn't working so everything I wanted could not be made. Well fine. So I ordered the curry with sausages. Of course the presentation was nice but I got 3 small sausages with lots of curry and not enough rice.  I decided to give this place another chance because determining something of what it is with one experience does not provide fair justice.  So I came again today with a friend. The minute we walk in, the employee notifies us that they don't have anymore curry.. Uhhhh well  My friend just decided on an omelette rice instead but apparently the certain rice they use for the omelette rice was not available either.  In the end, he ordered a spaghetti dish with a fried egg on the bottom called the 'Neopolitan'.  The employee brings over a free chicken salad to apologize for everything but I felt like it was in vain.  The food is good but the business seems unstable. Whatever the case is, I'll just stick to Curry Zen."}
{"text":"Still great and the dinner crowd was very little this time around.  I tried the curry this time. I think the deep fried variety dish is better. I will try their ramen next time.  Good experience overall."}
{"text":"This is very much a japanese restaurant with an authentic menu  I decided to skip the usual stuff and go in for the food a salaryman would eat when not slurping a One Coin bowl of ramen  Thus the Pork and Chicken Katsu Curry dishes were top picks. We shared the dishes and they were delicious. Japanese curry is different than indian curry but nevertheless its just as good.  We also enjoyed the meat croquettes which were not greasy and have a tasty Panko  coating as well especially when dipped in the curry sauce. These are traditional japanese comfort food dishes  I have also had the Salmon Teriyaki which is two filets smothered in a sweet soy sauce on rice with 2 croquettes. This makes for a filling and hearty meal.  yes the resto is in the parking lot but not actually inside the green P its at street level  The owner/chef Jun Yamashita does a wonderful job bringing a little bit of his Tokyo kitchen to the downtown core.  Great service, pricing a bit higher than normal but the food quality is excellent  I have not had bento box  or sushi so I cannot rate it"}
{"text":"A gem. If you appreciate authentic Japanese food, this place is for you.  The fish was very fresh and melted in my mouth. Last time I experienced the same freshness was in Kamakura, Japan. The atmosphere is unpretentious - if you're looking for fine dining, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for amazing food in a casual setting, Tokyo Kitchen delivers.  Many people seem to complain about the lack of washroom - first of all it's not true. There is one - and yes it's 30 second walk away outside the restaurant but who cares? I come here for the food, not for the washroom."}
{"text":"Reopened, but foods getting worse. Food, nothing special but typical Japanese dishes. Service, it was ok, but I can't say it was good. Price, it's too high, definitely overpriced. In overall, it was not bad experience, but was not good. I'd not go back probably."}
{"text":"Very delightful place to eat!  Went with a friend after work (who coincidentally came with me to Kaiju) to try out this place on his recommendation.  After a short commute we found out that the place was closed!  ...well at least until 5:30.  After a short wait at the nearby starbucks we finally saw the place was open and decided to head on in.  We were greeted by a small cozy restaurant and - get this - an actual Japanese waitress! She brought us our menus and quickly brought us our waters.    Being the big guys we were, I ordered a pork cutlet curry dinner and my friend got the chicken tatsuta curry dinner, along with a spicy salmon (to test how their sushi was) and the croquette (I've always wanted to try these!)  The waitress (did I mention she was Japanese?) took our order, went into the kitchen and yelled the order to the chef (who also was Japanese!).  Our orders came relatively quickly.  We then realized our grave error in that we had ordered way too much.  Digging in, the food was quite good! The katsu plate gave you 2 medium sized pieces of pork, along with a heaping amount of rice, and curry to boot.  I'm rather torn now, as both Kaiju and Tokyo kitchen have stolen my heart (and stomach respectively).  I think at the end of the day, I'd have to give it to Tokyo Kitchen, as their meat was that much more tender, and their curry was that much more gratuitous.  The owner of Kaiju will always have a spot in my heart, but for the time being, Tokyo Kitchen has my stomach.  Their croquette was, okay. As this was the first time I've had it, I have no comparison to pit against it, so all I can say was that it tasted to me like a deep fried potato cutlet, with small bits of meat thrown into it.   Finally their Spicy Salmon Roll was subpar.  I guess as a kitchen, I'll stick with their kitchen items.   At the end of the day, this place is a nice spot to go to for a cozy little conversation with a few others.  Their generously sized portions will leave you beyond satisfied, and if not, their prices were quite good to start off with.  Just order something else and be on your way. Their (Japanese) service was extremely friendly and courteous and made our visit all the more delightful.  Just make sure you don't need the washroom before you head there, as they'll give you a key attached to a spatula, and make you walk out of the restaurant in shame towards their shared washroom facilities located in the parking garage in which the restaurant is located by.  Yeah, that's a thing."}
{"text":"The place is nice and quiet, really good place to have a quiet dinner and can chill with friends. However there is no inside, even though the washroom is very close to the restaurant, we still need to go outside. The food was awesome. I hope they can give me more eel cuz it tastes so goooooooood??Highly recommend?"}
{"text":"Really sad this place is shut down.  Was my go-to local Japanese restaurant.  Really authentic Japanese food fare (outside of just sushi).  Oyakodon and curry are delicious.  Please open again soon!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and so friendly! I'll for sure to be back!   I got the Bento box A and my partner got the chicken teriyaki. Both were very good and we were eating off each other's plates."}
{"text":"Great service and food! I ordered the sweet curry and my boyfriend got the fried ouster curry. The spice levels are intense! It goes from level 1 to 20, 20 being the most spicy."}
{"text":"The bento boxes are perfect!! I'm visiting Toronto from the U.S. for a couple days and on a chilly, grey day, the cozy cafe, their hot tempura, a little sushi and an Oolong tea went a long way. It was served within minutes of placing my order. The portions aren't huge - they're just right! If you're a big eater though, you may want to augment."}
{"text":"I love this place... best Chicken Katsu Curry I've had in Toronto.  Tokyo Kitchen has a very traditional Japanese feel about it, not big on sushi rolls covered in tempura bits. More on traditional Japanese sauces and flavours.   Their curry sauce looks homemade with little morsels of braised beef in the sauce. It's an umami lovers paradise. Their age-dashi tofu is also delicious.  If you've read some of my other reviews, you'll see that I tend to get stuck on a few favourite dishes... so to be honest, I haven't tried much else yet so stay tuned for an updated review..."}
{"text":"Literally just had the best omelet rice ever. The environment is comfortable, clean, and relaxing. Will definitely be telling my friends about this and coming back!"}
{"text":"We were only in Toronto for 2 days, and found this place on Yelp. It felt like a true hidden gem (hidden, but well endorsed by yelp of course) and, I don't say this lightly, I think it was the best Japanese food I've had outside Japan.  Vegetable tempura was perfectly crispy and light with a good assortment of vegetables.  Sushi was both perfectly fresh and well crafted.  My husband was also really pleased with his Tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Real authentic Japanese home food. I highly recommend pork katsu or chicken tatsuta curry. The sashimi a la carte is great for ppl with small stomach. The portion is getting smaller from what I remember, but it's still enough to fill an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork katsu curry and bf had the sashimi and sushi dinner. The katsu was nice and crisp, and the curry was good. The side salad didnt have enough sauce? on it, and the rice was a little mushy. The sushi had thick cuts of fish on top, and the sashimi was also similarly cut. It came with salad and miso soup. The waitress was very nice and came to check up on us regularly."}
{"text":"My most recent experience with Tokyo Kitchen was getting a takeout meal, though I've dined in the restaurant numerous times.    Nestled in the same building as a municipal parking lot, you might miss it entirely if you weren't paying attention. Its recent renovation gives it a modern chic look, and is perhaps motivated by the two new condos that are soon to be full of potential customers. To be honest, I kinda miss the atmosphere of the old decor which gave it a warmer, homier feeling. They even had \"natto\" hand-written in kanji on a piece of paper taped to the wall. When you order it, the wait staff may regard you with surprise especially if they know you're not Japanese, but if you persist, they'll serve it to you. Ask for natto with egg yolk and scallions.  They serve both cooked foods and raw sushi, though the sushi selection is necessarily limited to ensure high turn over and therefore freshness. Don't expect much beyond salmon and tuna most days. That being said, the offerings I had were always fresh.  The cooked foods are uniformly good, including most of their fried dishes like karaage, kaki fry and tempura. I also like their donburi a lot; their katsudon comes with breaded porkchop that is nonetheless moist and flavourful if a little too salty sometimes. Their curry rice is pretty good as well. They used to have an omelette curry and a \"hamburg\" curry which I don't seem to see any more. Maybe I'll try asking for it anyway the next time I drop by for dinner. And I echo Ryan R.'s appraisal about the croquettes... very, very good.  Notes: I mention that they take credit card, but it's actually Visa only. Also, the washroom is outside of the restaurant and you need to bring a key with you. I believe it's part of the parking lot building, so this might put some people off."}
{"text":"finally it reopened after two long years.  Love it, service was very good, the girls were very attentive.  Food are good, just want to try everything. This is a place if you want some simple home cook Japanese food.  Nothing fancy but good.  For sure i will be back all the time since i just live in the area.  True the price went up, but so are every other places in toronto ever since the min. wage went up. But i think is reasonable and worth it.  The person think food medicore with absurd prices, may be he only eat at Mcdonald."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and was seated by a sweet you girl. My friend and I often go to Sushi Inn, but we decided to try Tokyo Kitchen for the first time as it is supposed to be very authentic Japanese food.  The restaurant itself is rather bare bones with limited decorations and plastic chopsticks and cups. The menu is also on the smaller side with fewer options than you may typically expect to find.  My friend ordered the special of the day which was beef teriyaki which came with rice, salad, and a croquette (fried potato ball with meat mixed in). I ordered a cucumber roll and the sunomono salad (seafood, seaweed, cucumber, and a sweet vinegar. The cucumber roll and salad came quickly and I decided to order a second order of the sunomono as the serving size appeared quite small. This second salad also appeared quickly. After waiting for about half an hour without any sign of my friend's food, we decided to inquire about it. It turns out that the waitress had not heard the order for the special of the day, so it had not been prepared. At this stage I was a bit confused about why the waitress had not come to check in on us earlier as we were sitting with three plates of untouched food in front of us for about 25 minutes (I had not touched my food as I was waiting for my friend to receive hers). Her plate came quickly after we fixed this mix up.  The cucumber roll was quite large (8 pieces) with a lot of rice and chunks of cucumber rather than the finely sliced slivers I typically expect. The seafood in the sunomono salad was crab meat and two pieces of shrimp. I found the dressing to be quite salty and one bowl contained considerably more dressing than the other. My friend said her beef teriyaki was good, although it wasn't an outstanding dish.  The smaller restaurant got rather busy during the lunch hour and the server was getting a bit overwhelmed as she was tending to everyone on her own. At one point, the female chef actually emerged from the back to bring out two dishes to patrons.   Payment is also a bit confusing because some people paid at their tables whereas others went up to the counter to pay. We had to ask for our bill and the waitress asked us to come to the counter to pay.  Overall it probably is good authentic Japanese food, but I don't think I will be rushing back anytime soon. I was also disappointed that we were not offered complimentary green tea."}
{"text":"New curry place in the corner of the second floor. We saw a sign pointing to their place and thought to check it out. The place is decorated really cute and has a very lounge-y feel to it. I ordered the katsu curry and added veggies with a spice level 5. I really like spicy food and this had a pretty comfortable spice that kind of builds up like when you eat hot cheetos. They have a very interesting concept to their place because they have some board games laying around for you to play. So in a sense it's like an asian cafe with more dinner-time foods. My boyfriend and I broke out the game of Blokus I felt like such a happy little kid getting to play games while I ate my meal.  Everything was delicious, and they had little pickled sides on the table which I practically ate most of. At the back next to the games they also had cute cut out frames for posting on facebook and instagram, so when you share it on social media they let you try a dessert. We picked the chocolate banana parfait. It was more like a sundae and there were some Frosted Flakes type stuff on the bottom, which was a nice texture to everything. The staff was very nice and the waitress was very personable. Definitely a good place to just hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are really good. The bento boxes are well done. The service is fast and they put two tables together for a birthday group of 8. It's worth a try. Can also confirm the server and chefs are Japanese for what it's worth."}
{"text":"I only had the chance to sample the take out from this place, maybe I'll go back to try the dine in and give a more complete review.  I got the beef bento box, but I had to pay $1 above the \"daily special\" price, as salmon was on sale that day.  Packaging - Wow, i have never seen a lunch takeout packaged so well. Even the salad dressing had its own little container, so that the salad wouldn't get wilted.  Salad - authentic dressing, but the size was a bit small.  Teryaki Beef - Beef and sauce was nice, but again a bit small. Rice was good.  Other - Can't remember what they were [as this review is a little late], but I'm sure they were good.  Sushi - California rolls were good, salmon was nigiri, which was surprising.  Summary - Food was tasty, but portion size was a little lacking. Is this due to takeout?  I'm not sure until i return for dine in."}
{"text":"Now that I'm not hangry like i was during my last review,  had their omelet  rice, it was really tasty.  Loved it,  like the atmosphere to,  quite but nice.  Wish they weren't out of neapolitan but other then that wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"This cosy Japanese restaurant is one of my fav in Toronto. It has the best Katsu in town, must try! also the fried tempuras are amazing, very light and crispy, not oily at all. They also have ikura don which is rare to find in other Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The food was flavourless and we ordered the shrimp teriyaki special and it was too dry small pieces of shrimp. Barely edible.   Outside didn't look great either. Inside it was small. The food came out pretty quick but that's probably because it's precooked.   The service was nice but I'm never going back. I think the should close up shop."}
{"text":"Curry was awesome, highly recommend broccoli tuna salad and French toast. I will obviously come back later."}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese-run Japanese place.  I was pumped to see 'sake oyako don' on the menu. It's a simple bowl of sushi rice, salmon sashimi, and salmon roe. I friggin love those salty, glistening, plump jewels of salty goodness. Man they're so salty and good and plump.  Note: this place doesn't have washrooms. For reals. You have to go to the parking garage like some convict.  Fun fact: 'oyako' means 'parent and child'. Get it? You're eating the adult fish, and its little babies in the same dish. Kinda sick? A little. Also, ordering 'oyako don' might get you chicken and eggs on rice (see, same deal). So check yo'self before ordering."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Very spacious and the food is really good.  Their place is on the 2nd floor.  They have really nice furniture.  The curry is flavorful and the chicken cutlet was moist.  Parking is easy. Right off spring mountain."}
{"text":"High and consistent quality of home style Japanese. Their sushi are on point as well. Plays soft jazz."}
{"text":"I know this place is still fairly new, so I'm not judging it harshly. My first time experience was not bad. The inside had a very chill and relaxing atmosphere and our server was really nice. As for food, it did take awhile to get. I got the omelette rice it wasn't bad but I felt like the egg may have been a bit undercooked. But I'd definitely come again and try some of the other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"This might be irrelevant, but a lot of reviews here keep on talking about how cute the waitress is. I can contest to this. She is a lovely person who is both efficient and polite.  Besides this, Tokyo Kitchen is a pretty awesome place. It's rather small with no washroom (whaaat?) but other than those flaws, the menu has a lot of choices to choose from! They have croquettes and Japanese curry and tonkatsu, which is kind of hard to find around here. I personally think their lunch or dinner specials are much more worth your money. The portions are pretty large, so don't balk at the price on the menu.   A lot of university students eat here, but it's not terribly crowded when you go in to eat. I found everything to be quite good- the tempura is doughy but very crispy, and the salad is the basic kind you can find at any restaurant. I swapped my teriyaki for BBQ eel, which for the record was not worth it. There were 4 slices of eel on top of a bowl of rice, but you pay an extra $1 if you order the BBQ eel in your set menu.  One other thing I don't like is that you have to pay for tea. It happens a lot in Toronto but I still feel personally victimized whenever a place doesn't offer up tea immediately for free. I think we should start a petition for free tea in Japanese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Recently renovated, delicious home style japanese food.    The croquette cury is delicious.    Nice patio, and great place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Tokyo kitchen is a cool place. The interior is pretty nice. I got the omelet rice and it was cool. I had some pork cutlet on the side and that was tasty. The pieces of the pork cutlet were pretty big.  When my friend and I came in we were the only ones in there. Our food took about 15-20 minutes. We ordered 2 omelet rices and a side of pork cutlet.   The waitress was super nice she also answered some questions I had about the food. Defiantly coming back to try the curry next time.   Overall my first time experience here was not bad."}
{"text":"I never had curry for a long time, and when I came here I was craving it.  I had the pork cutlet curry, because the server told us that it was a popular dish.  I ordered it with a spice level of 3 and it was a little spicy, but I can handle it.  I can't wait to come here next time to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants in GTA! The dishes are delicious, visually pleasing and very fresh, great environment, great service -- this is the place you want to go if you want to taste genuine Japanese food."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant that I had never heard of based on the positive reviews here, and was not disappointed!  Having traveled to Japan twice (and going for a 3rd time in a month!), I'm always looking for authentic Japanese restaurants that go beyond the usual sushi places. Tokyo Kitchen is a small, low-key restaurant that doesn't have to try too hard- the delicious food speaks for itself.  As the other reviews mention, the restaurant had many Japanese-speaking patrons, always a good sign!  My 2 dining companions and I went a little overboard. There were so many things we wanted to try, but in hindsight I think we ordered too much because we could barely finish everything.  We had the croquettes (appetizer), which were crispy and reminded me of typical izakaya-fare in Tokyo. We also shared the tempura - a good litmus test for a Japanese restaurant. The tempura was nice and light, not too starchy or greasy like at some other restaurants. Then we had a tuna and vegetable appetizer (I forget the name), which was very fresh.  I ordered the chicken curry dinner, which comes with a side salad (why do all Japanese restaurants insist on boring iceberg lettuce? however, the homemade sesame dressing is flawless). The chicken is fried, similar to tonkatsu, and served on skewers. The curry sauce is hearty and just a little bit sweet. My friends had the sushi dinner and sashimi dinner. They said the sushi and sashimi were good, but not amazing. However, prices were very fair.  Despite the authentic Japanese dining experience, there are a few anomalies. Service was just okay. At one point, our waitress seemed confused and brought us someone else's dish. Green tea is actually from a tea bag and the miso soup is served with a spoon -- not really how things are done in Japan.  Overall, though, this is a great find! Our dinner came to $75 and we left very full! (Probably could've done without so many appetizers). Looking forward to go back soon and try more dishes!  (Oh and Natto -- fermented beans, is now on the English menu too in case anyone is interested)."}
{"text":"I saw banners of this restaurant whenever I drove through china town, so I decided to give it a try. And I was so happy that I made that decision. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual. They even have couches for people to lounge on! What a great idea in my opinion. They also have cute social media frames for you to take pictures on.   Onto the menu, they have curry, toppings, little dishes that can fill you up. I decided to get the Neapolitan spaghetti. When I first ordered it, I didn't know what to expect. As soon as it came to the table, I took a bite and it was heavenly. the sauce was rich and gave off a sweet and savory flavor. And the noodles were the perfect texture. There was also an omelet on the bottom and it goes so well with the spaghetti...how smart! Overall, it was a really good dish, I cleaned off my plate.   Im definitely going to come back when I have a chance. I hope the best for you, tokyo kitchen! Keep dishing out those dishes."}
{"text":"Food is reallllllyyyy good! Not too much sauce unlike other places.katsu are perfectly cooked-crispy outside tender inside."}
{"text":"I was craving curry but I wanted to try something new, Me and my friends heard about this place through someone else. I like the furniture and atmosphere felt like a cafe curry.   AS for the food it was amazing, the crisp of the pork cutlet was perfect. The sauce felt powerful and wholesome, the portions are great. I reccomend this place to any lovers of curry."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese place - I recommend it if you're looking for the real thing. Many of the patrons are Japanese themselves, which is considered a good sign.  The atmosphere is comfortable and the food is solid & comforting, I would recommend you to try any kind of tempura, it's really worth it. The washroom is outside around the corner what is a bit inconvenient."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It was a pleasure eating quality, fresh, perfectly cut sashimi served at the appropriate temperature.  My goodness, why did I not discover this place earlier?!  The food is not inexpensive and the portions not huge, but you are eating quality.  They have a fairly extensive menu of cooked items but we had the sashimi today and it did not disappoint.  Nice selection - butter fish, maguro, sake, and I can't remember what else.  All I remember is closing my eyes and saying oh my goodness, this is how it is really done!!  Only criticism which does not earn them five stars -- they do not have a washroom for customers on site - you have to use the washroom in the parking garage next door (they have a key which they give you to use).  Otherwise, fantastic.  Will definitely be back.  DOMO ARIGATO TOKYO KITCHEN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken katsu curry and it was ok.  Tasted like powdered curry.  Portion size was pretty good, but the curry lacked any strong flavor; it was quite bland actually.  I'd say the dish was a bit high in price so I'd order something else next time.  Takoyaki was not bad either, but I think Manpukku does it better.  Service was good and location is super convenient. Overall, I had an ok experience, not great but not bad as well."}
{"text":"One of the better lunch spots near Bloor and Yonge. The Beef Curry with Shrimp Cutlettes ($9.95) was quite tasty. The Beef Curry was really more like beef in gravy and the Shrimp Cutlettes were essentially 3 breaded shrimp. I guess that's just how they roll in Japan; works for me.  Wait staff are super efficient and polite. The space inside is small but they have a nice outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"The food was great. The spring rolls are the best I've had (though my experience is limited). The beef teriyaki was tender and so flavourful. The food came out very quickly. The waitress was absolutely charming. Highly recommended.  The restaurant is very tiny, though, and apparently there are no washrooms inside (as another reviewer mentioned)."}
{"text":"So good! So convenient! Ikura oroshi and vegetable bento box are especially good, as is the mountain vegetable soup. Can't wait until it reopens!"}
{"text":"this place is temporarily closed per the handwritten sign on the door. wish this was reflected on Yelp before going there!"}
{"text":"Went once,  good.  Called to order lunch about a week later, no one answered.  Tried again on a Saturday,  closed.  Not sure what's going on. ..they don't keep their posted times.   Would give them more stars if they were ever open."}
{"text":"Need a great curry place without the headache of finding a spot for parking? Tokyo Kitchen is where it's at! The curry is so creamy and delicious and the katsu was amazing! They have a spicy level ranging from 1-20 and my boyfriend got the level 3 and thought that was spicy enough.  Their servers are nice and attentive and the atmosphere is nice. It has a nice cafe feel to it and they play lots of my favorite songs here!  10/10 would go again to try more of their delicious food. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after their opening a month go and it was not bad! Prices were definitely a bit higher considering it was the usual Japanese food. I got their Salmon bento box which came with sashimi, salad, miso soup, and tempura. The tempura was deep friend perfectly and they were generous in portions! Their Tendon Tonkatsu Donburi was also quite delicious and the tonkatsu was sooooo soft. However despite how authentic and fresh their food was, prices were a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"Very good server tasty food but a bit heavy on the spices the food is pretty good the chef is nice his young and talent but the service is what's best about this place   There is needs to improve by the food needs to be more consistent   And a bit more desserts will be nice"}
{"text":"Good point:  Good service and their al staffs are japanese so you can actually taste real home taste of japanese food here.  I lived in Tokyo for 7 years and their sushi and sashimi was best in this toronto.  Very fresh and thick sashimi and thin rice with perfact temperature. (even I went to expensive nice sushi place it wasnt that good. ) Rice is 100% japanese rice.  Sushi and sashimi and Tempura soba was good.  But soba inside of soup ..I can taste a alittle bit of MSG.( AJINOMOTO ) I tired everything katsu in there and it was so good.  Very crunch gatsu with a curry.  But rice was too much and a little bit of curry.  The orginal of japanese curry always with a lot of vegetables but they only cook with onion....bad curry.  There's two waitresses and one is really kind and friendlybut  the other is not friendly at all. Yes. There's no washroom here..."}
{"text":"The spinach curry was amazing! Very casual, relaxed atmosphere. Seats about 30. Waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu.   Top 3 curries in Las Vegas. Also, they're the first curry spot I've seen where the spice level goes to 20. My dinner partner had a 7 kurobuta sausage curry and it was a spot on 7. I have to come back for a 20. Like, it isn't an option. I'll update this when it happens!"}
{"text":"One perk of teaching ESL to international students is insider knowledge of Toronto's best authentic restaurants.   Every single Japanese student I ever had, has ranted and raved about Tokyo Kitchen. My students usually stay in Canada for at least a year and the thing they miss most is authentic Japanese food. To them, all-you-can-eat sushi with avocado is bizarre and amusing. My idea of a Japanese raw seaweed salad turns out to actually be a super westernized version of a salad that is much rawer and healthier.   To extinguish my ignorance towards real Japanese food, my lovely class decided to take me to Tokyo Kitchen. Tucked away on Charles Street, the place was somewhat difficult to spot  -- it's so modest that you might mistake it for a run-down grocery store.  I absolutely loved it. It was so small. And so simple. There were no fancy decorations or paintings or awards pinned to the walls. Instead, a few posters were taped to pastel walls that were so quirky in their modesty. The menu wasn't easy to read because I didn't know what most of the food was but I'm sure if I blindly chose anything, it would be delicious.  We ordered:  takoyaki- This has become my favourite Japanese appetizer/dish/snack/whatever it is. And it was the BEST takoyaki I've ever tried. Takoyaki is a ball with octopus inside, sprinkled with dried shredded fish. It doesn't sound like much but it's absolutely incredible.  sashimi- Self explanatory. I really love sashimi and Tokyo Kitchen's sashimi was VERY good. It was soft and buttery and fresh. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  katsudon- This was also delicious, especially if you like pork and you're looking for something filling. It's a bowl of rice topped with deep-fried pork cutlet, egg and some condiments.   salmon don- YUMMY! THIS IS FOR ALL YOU SASHIMI LOVERS. It's a bowl of vinegar-soy rice, topped with lots of salmon sashimi. It fills you up and you get your sashimi fix! Sooo good!  We had a sweet server who was really patient with our large group and slow decision-making skills. She also put all the dishes on the table so it was a nice, communal dinner. The total cost us about 15 bucks each and we were stuffed by the end of the meal.  I really recommend this place for all lovers of Japanese food...And even to those who don't like Japanese food because there's a big chance that you might fall in love with it after Tokyo Kitchen."}
{"text":"I've only had take out, so that may account for the differences, but I found Tokyo Kitchen very average. I had Katsudon, which came with a small soup and salad, and takoyaki. The katsudon was ok, nothing special, and the portion was kinda small. The takoyaki had only one small piece of tako each; the rest was batter.  Overall, the food was ok, but nothing special. Probably will not go back again."}
{"text":"Always loved coming here. You guys made me fall in love with curry.  By far the best in the GTA that you can eat in a restaurant.  But my concern is, with all the delays and all, are you really expected to reopen...? Updates would be nice..."}
{"text":"This place used to be kaba curry before Tokyo kitchen took over. They picked a good area to have this restaurant at. Walked in and was greeted by a lovely server sat us down pretty quick. We were craving some curry. The reading of the menu was pretty straight forward. When you share your picture with their cut out of a IG Post board you will get a free dessert which was a plus.  The food was pretty good; ordered the chicken cutlet curry. Only downfall was my food was just a little cold. But overall service and presentation was excellent. Need more people to come to this place and make it busy."}
{"text":"Definitely loved this place. Very delicious curry.   First time going and extremely satisfied.   I ordered the pork cutlet curry with deep fried shrimp. The choices of spicy is 0-20. I decided to go for a 4 this time. It was a little bit spicy for my likings so will definitely get a low spice for next time. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.   Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Always helping when asked for. Took a little bit of time to be noticed but there was only one server so it's within reason."}
{"text":"I really love the ambience and lighting of the place! The place is very calm and relaxing when I dined at night. The curry is just the right portion to make your belly satisfied. I like my curry place with simplicity and quality. Enjoyed my experience here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I loved coming here. Renovations did start in the space where the restaurant used to be... fingers crossed it will re-open and soon."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, a Little Expensive.  FOOD - GREAT!  My friend and I both ordered curry, one chicken and one pork. The portions for the Pork is larger than the Chicken, but the Chicken tastes more tender.  The Curry is excellent, and I'll definitely go back for more. But ah, so much to try, so little stomach space...  The store actually has a very large menu, so I wish that was available online. Maybe I'll take a picture next time.  SERVICE - GREAT!  It's the usual hospitality you'd expect from a Japanese restaurant. Water comes quickly, and everyone is so polite.  PRICE - Mid-range  It's more expensive than Kaiju, but you get larger portions here, and it's authentic cuisine here.  The side dishes were more expensive than I would have liked. Takoyaki comes to nearly $1 per piece.  EXTRA NOTE  The chopsticks. They use the kind that is hexagonal at the grips and square at the tips!   All in all, Tokyo Kitchen is a great choice with a wide variety of items to choose from, but definitely the best place for curry in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Small neighborhood restaurant is clean, bright, and tastefully decorated.  An elegant, light-filled place. Saw lots of good hearty hot dishes on the menu, which makes this a place to come for all sorts of cravings.  I love the curry rice bowls, tried it with croquettes, omelet, and fried pork.  Big portions with ample amount of curry, which is good because it's a common problem for me to get too much rice and not enough curry.  It's not very spicy, and simply delicious.  A few carefully selected sakes and shoju are also available at decent price.      Also tried a juicy, lemony, lightly crispy, absolutely delicious fried chicken nuggets appetizer (not called karaage though...a different dish).  Love it.  Cold soba was decent.  I did not order but was impressed by the variety and amount of food on the sushi/sashimi lunch special and the bento box specials.  Beautifully presented too.  Definitely above the usual formulaic ones at a lot of places.  Tempuras were battered and fried quite nicely too.    There's no ramen here though.    Service was really bad my first time there.  Being the only customer but still took forever to get waitress attention for everything.  But improved the second time at a busy lunch with a different waitress.    Overall, solid all around."}
{"text":"I don't eat in, dont like the idea of no washroom on site. I live on the same street, so I pick up my food on my way home. Love their sashimi, the fish is very fresh and of exeptional quality."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Honestly the food wasn't BAD, but it's definitely not a place I'd ever crave or feel the urge to go back to, it's just.. meh.  Value: 1/5 The price was a little outrageous. I ordered a unadon (eel on rice) for $22.80, bf got a beef curry udon for $14+, and a \"dynamite roll\" for $9.50, which was the same quality as those cheap sushi box you'd get at a supermarket. Our total came to $55 BEFORE tax.  Service: 4/5 The girls were very nice, all was well except when we were paying, I specifically asked if they took AMEX, the service said yes, and when it didn't go through, another waitress came and informed me that they didn't take AMEX   All in all, if the price was 30% less, It would be a good choice for a quick meal in the neighbourhood. But as of now, I don't recommend and won't be visiting again.  Pity."}
{"text":"I needed a catch-up date with a long lost friend of mine. For two years, we were trying to have dinner together but it didn't happen due to conflict of schedules... UNTIL FOUR DAYS AGO!!!! I missed her dearly.  We both love sushi and there are SO MANY Japanese restaurants to choose from in this neighbourhood, which is actually really really awesome. However I chose this place because it looked like a cafe: small, quiet, peaceful, date-like. By \"choosing\" I really mean sending a text to my friend \"Hey C, let's try here? I've never been.\" I've never seen it, I've never walked passed it, I don't know what's on the menu. I only saw a photo of its tables.  Tokyo Kitchen is on Charles Street, a little cafe that opens at 5:30pm for dinner (and 11:30 to 2:30 is for lunch).   We looked through the menu, lots of the usual items like udon, fried, set dinners (they look decent for the price).... Curious about the curry dishes though!   Anyways we ended up having the Party Tray for $29. This came with assorted sushi: spicy salmon, salmon, tuna, shrimp, soft-shell crab... So the tray came out, sushi on a plastic tray.... looked like store-bought. At first I thought it would be a plate of ordinary sushi (and I thought I wouldn't be wow'd by it), but I was wrong!!!! The sushi was presented beautifully, and it was fresh and delicious. I can be pretty picky with sushi (I've had ENOUGH store-bought sushi's and AYCE sushi's, and yes I've also eaten at expensive places that offer amazing sea urchin sushi). Tokyo Kitchen's sushi were excellent. Affordable and delicious.  The sashimi especially was amazing. I loved their tuna sushi the most -so so fresh!!   This meal was so cheap and it was so good. I also loved that we sat by the window, it felt like a coffee shop (that serves sushi! How funky is that?). It's so cute here.   The waitresses were very nice. We were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place; cute, neat, relaxing atmosphere and such a friendly staff. It's the best curry I had in this city. The only thing is high price for such a small portion plenty of sauce not enough meat. We also asked for extra rice twice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here quite late around 11:30pm. We were craving Japanese curry and this is open late. Tokyo Kitchen is super cute! They have non-matching furniture which is always fun. It is a curry restaurant. They had a few chef specials like spaghetti and stew, but the menu offers mostly curry. There is maybe 10 different types of toppings you can choose from. I got the chicken cutlet with cheese added with 0 spicy level. I usually choose this to be save at first because I know how some places can be. They also have a \"sweet\" option which is cool. The curry was not as thick as other places like zen curry but  it was still tasty. I had a couple of their desserts and they were both very delicious. The service was okay. The waiters seem to be new at serving, so I kind of have empathy for them cause I have been a server before. Otherwise, everything went well. Will definitely come again when I have a late night curry craving."}
