{"text":"If you didn't know, you'd probably just pass Scheffler's off as just another delicatessan in the market that sells some other \"stuff\". But you need to look closer to truly appreciate what they have to offer.

Let's be honest, you can probably get the same cheeses, the same olives, and the same proscuitto anywhere, but you can't find fresh pate/terrines anywhere else.

The only other place I know of in TO that offers this would probably be Petite Thuet? But Scheffler's sells nice little wedges of exotic terrines out front such as rabbit, wild boar, pheasant, caribou, goose, etc. and also some of the more traditional duck and pork based terrines.

Scheffler's is always my first and last stop at the market. Prices are reasonable and the quality can't be matched anywhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing assortment of cheeses and cured meats.

They're helpful, friendly and mean business when it comes to cheese.  It's a weekly stop in the market..."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of deli meats and had no problem taking back some cheese I bought yesterday that was mouldy (and shouldn't have been!)"}
{"text":"Love this place make my usual run when I'm in the market. Great variety of fresh  deli meat and cheeses from around the world. You want some quality ,this is the place to hit . But what binds it for me , its the great staff . friendly and knowledgeable. I cant say enough about this gem in the St Lawrence Market .No problem in letting you taste the great products.  And lets not forget , Angie is smoking hot !! But if your having friends over  and looking for amazing products to give your party that wow factor this is the place"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place until I noticed something sketchy going on. They had this batch of calendo brie on sale, and I saw from the packages that they would expire very soon (I checked the whole stack, they were all about to expire), so I didn't buy it. I come back 2 weeks later (so the cheese would have been expired by now), but the cheeses were STILL THERE! And the expiration dates had been RUBBED OFF THE PACKAGE! You could see the blurry smudge where the expiration stamp used to be.

Also, their prices are not even that great. Certain cheeses are overpriced, and the crackers (like the rainforrest chips) are way more expensive than say Domino Foods downstairs."}
{"text":"The best PICKLES I've EVER had.. 

They are really amazing with aftertaste, massive and sit in a large barrel. Grab a few and they are even a better deal than the store jarred pickles. Maybe keep some gum handy after for the garlic but really, these are in their own category of goodness.

They do their antipasti foods really well. Great eggplant, provolone and sun dried tomato snacks, the dips are all high quality (loved their baba ganoush).

Stop by here at St Lawrence, you won't regret the treats you bring home."}
{"text":"I just had some Pingue prosciutto that I purchased today upon the recommendation of my meat lovin sistah, Christine C. 

This prosciutto is some of the best I have ever had. Like Sarah L says, it ain't cheap, but it is worth it. 

Served on a baguette slice (from Carousel) is my favourite way to enjoy these thin slices of heaven. As soon as you bite into this cured meat it goes from light and airy into a soft buttery texture against your teeth. The flavour is amazing. This stuff is nitrate free, so it does not taste like the prepacked stuff you get at the grocery store. It also isn't tough and super salty like that cheap ass shit either. 

The next time you are at the Market, do yourself a favour and get a few slices of Pingue (Niagara on the Lake) prosciutto. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love the St Lawrence market - there's a reason so many international foodies rate this as one of the best markets in the world. The primary reason it is so good are the shops within, and Scheffler's is one of my regular stops. They have a great selection of cheeses, including many local and artisanal treasures, not just all the requisite offerings. The selection of meats is focused on the quality end of the scale, so if you're used to buying deli meats at No Frills there will be some sticker shock for you, but No Frills doesn't sell Jamon Iberico de Bellotta, do they? Scheffler's also carries an excellent assortment of condiments, dips and other delectables. Stop by and your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been going here for years. I always get some roasted garlic, farmer's cream cheese, hummus and my mini pitas and/or crackers. Staff are always lovely. Only once did I find mouse teeth marks that had chewed threw my mini pita bag."}
{"text":"This is officially my favourite St. Lawrence Market cheese stall. That is saying a lot because there are a million of them. Let me \"Brie\"k it down for you:

1. Helpful, knowledgeable, not-pushy staff
2. Great prices and specials
3. Plentiful, multifarious samples

I stopped by on a weekend market stroll and tried everything from 15-year-old cheddar to Brie de Meaux (raw milk) to the triple creamed cheese they had on sale, and if you're reading this, Scheffler's -- I bought them all!

A-Oka. Very gouda. Cheddar than all the rest. I'll see myself out."}
{"text":"Scheffler's is one of my favourites in the St. Lawrence Market.  With an extensive deli section, a selection of cheese, yogurts and an olive bar which also includes items such as housemade hummus, tzatziki, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella - this place is every hostesses dream come true. 

You will also find a variety of specialty olive oils and spices.  

This is a family-run business and the owners are extremely friendly and down-to-earth.  

Although you can find more economical prices for the more common cuts of deli meats, you definitely won't find some of the specialty items elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Generally I find the St Lawrence market overpriced and overrated - you can find equal or better products all around Toronto; the benefit of getting all at one time is not worth the cost.

But Schleffer's has totally changed my view, because hot damn did they kill it this past Saturday. Loaded with free samples, ample sales staff who were more than willing to talk and let us taste their cheeses - without being pushy or stingy, and half price on all their french cheeses - we came away with some dynamite old cheddar and two bries. I will happily make the bike down here out of my way for all my future fromages."}
{"text":"Seriously what is not to like about a place that serves up delicious deli meats and cheeses with an appetizers bar that will blow your mind!  I mean, how many different types of olives does one need to host a cocktail party?  

This place has it all...the staff is very helpful, and let's face it...some of the men behind the meat counter are pretty freakin' HOT!  Which only adds to an already enjoyable shopping experience!

The prices here are on par with other shops in the market, and yes, the prosciutto can be a little pricey, but it is THE BEST prosciutto in town, so I'll happily pay it.  

If you're not into to delicious deli meats, cheeses and olive bars, I would like to point out they also stock some exceptional pates...I'm talking pheasant and pistachio, or wild boar and pear people!  But wait, in additional to ALL OF THE ABOVE...they also carry some kick ass gourmet pantry items...olive oils, aged balsamics, gourmet cooking chocolate, truffle oil...the list goes on, and on, and on.

Yeah, it gets five stars...I'd give it 6 if I could (if only for cutie who served me)."}
{"text":"My favourite cheese shop in the St Lawrence Market. So many free samples always get me to buy new things.

Today's haul included:
Italian burrata ($10 and they bring it in every other week)

Iberico Sausage

{"text":"After a frantic few days of looking for a condo to rent after having just relocated from Australia, the last thing we wanted to do was have to slave over a hot stove to cook dinner.
 
Thankfully we were dropped off by our realtor at St Lawrence Markets. It was very late in the afternoon and it was mostly empty but we found our way to a great deli that had some of our favorite products, cheese, terrines and prosciutto.

They have a huge variety of cheese at very reasonable prices (compared to Australia anyway), three types of terrines (we opted for Pheasant and Pistachio) and three or four types of prosciutto (we opted for Italian).

The terrine was really good, great taste and not overly rich. Pieces of pistachio was found throughout. 

We had a lovely \"picnic\" at our temporary accommodation, which was something we often did on Friday nights at home."}
{"text":"Scheffler's carries the most outrageous Dry Cured Spanish Chorizo that is locally made.  It is supplied to Scheffler's by Barcelona Meats.  They are sold in bulk not wrapped.  $3 per sausage  best of all,  they are Nitrate Free, Gluten Free, No MSG, and no Trans Fats! They have them in both Mild and Spicy!"}
{"text":"This place is part of my Saturday morning extended breakfast route. Every Saturday morning I wander past for their samples which are delicious! They have the most delicious cheeses and hams to try and I'm addicted. This would definitely be my destination for the tastiest brie and prosciutto if I was having people over for dinner or wine and cheese. They have a wide selection, the staff are friendly and they know their products. Yes, it's pricey, but I'll save the cheap cheese for people I don't like.

The store also houses a wide range of jams, crackers and condiments. It's dangerous to visit really-too much temptation for someone like me. Every time I go there I seem to wander out with fig jam or some kind of marmalade. My yoga pants are the only thing that fit now!"}
{"text":"The best deli meats and overall spread selection I've had in toronto. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is my favorite store in the market.  I like it better than the mustard shop, better than the Mad Mexican downstairs and even better than the bakery that sells the *gasp* raspberry twists. 

The best: 
They have the best prosciutto going for home use.  I admit that some of the house-cured hams at the finer charcuterie establishments 'round town probably take the cake.  For home use though, this is where it's at.

The good:
- They have an entire wall of olive oils 
- They sell some harder to find meats (which Kat found out when she was on a mad rush to find speck one day)
- They have the best prosciutto going.  Did I mention that?  It's the 18month Italian one.  That is the one you want.

The bad:
- A bit pricey.  I actually find the market to be expensive across the board.  (smoked turkey $20/kg, above mentioned prosciutto $55/kg).  Normally at Loblaws, 10 slices of thin (Canadian, 8-12m) prosciutto is $3-$4 and my 10 slices today cost almost $8 (well spent)
- It's rammed in here on the weekend.  You can't even get near it.  
- I'm never sure where I'm supposed to order meat from.  The counter doesn't really have a 'stand here for meat' sign.

Would I go here again?
Absolutely.  I love the meat here.  I'd rather pay a bit more for the finest pork I can acquire than settle for a second rate sandwich.  

I will be holding master classes in sandwich artistry in the coming months, stay tuned."}
{"text":"6/24/15: Came here as part of a food tour, and while I didn't get to choose the items that we ate, I could tell that everything is awesome here.

1. Cheese:  The one we had was some kind of cheddar (I think).  Very strong and packed with flavor.  Has more of the stinkiness found in the high-end soft cheeses, and is just a totally high-end ultra-high-grade cheese.

2. Prosciutto: Well, I think it's prosciutto, or at least some variant.  Sorry, I'm not versed in all the different cured meats, but to me that's the general category.  Sliced ultra-super-thin and served on butcher's paper.  Looks and tastes great.

3. Peppers:  So, I dunno what these were, but they're a little more than 1cm in diameter, and are really cute!  Red with a little tail sticking out.  You eat them with toothpicks.  Tastes sweet and isn't too hot.  Love these!

If you want a snack, this is the place to go if you're in the St. Lawrence Market building.

{"text":"Am I the best person to send on a wild boar chase around the city in the hot pursuit of cured juniper ham (aka Speck)?? Probably not, but I found myself in this very predicament and my nose led me straight into Scheffler's arms after over a dozen frantic calls to various butchers across the city (\"Huh, what's Speck? No idea.\" was the most common response I got). 

I was able to score the Austro-Italian type prosciutto at a competitive price, which is unsurprising considering Scheffler's boasts the largest selection of prosciutto in the entire city. Here you can also stock up on a variety of cheese, spicy stuffed peppers, grape leaves, fresh pesto and other briny foods like pickled onions, olives and capers.

CUTIE ALERT: Owner Odysseas Gounalakis has owned Scheffler's for 20 years, and first met his wife Sandra while they were both working at St. Lawrence Market. Awww."}
{"text":"Ordered a charcuterie board from Scheffler's and it was excellent. Included was 8 different cheeses and 4 different meats along with gherkins, olives, figs and nuts. The presentation was great, including labels for each item and it was lots of food. I would definitely order this again."}
