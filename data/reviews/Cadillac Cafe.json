{"text":"What a great hidden gem of a place. Everything is made to order and the daily specials are only $6 including drink! This place is actually inside of the Service Department of the dealership. There is seating available inside and out.  The Steakhouse burger is incredible."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch. I've had a lot of the stuff on the menu, the crab cake sandwich was OFF THE CHAIN! The drinks they make are amazing. You can get a meal with a side and a drink for 8 bucks. Also they change their menu a lot so you will have great selection. Every Friday they have BBQ Ribs and those are so good with the homemade sauce they use. You can have the chef text you the menu they have every day. If you work close by this would be the perfect place for lunch. I just wish they don't close everyday at 2pm. Also wish they open on the weekends."}
{"text":"Working at a nearby dealership, I had always heard a lot of good things about the food and folks at Cafe de Cadillac.   Our dealership started to order the food to be catered for our Saturday work lunches.   Outstanding food! Fresh, fast, inexpensive and very tasty!  With that said, I have added it to my arsenal of week day lunch spots. I didn't know what to expect, but it is well placed within the service lane of Cadillac of South Charlotte! There is also a small seating area.  It may not seem like the ideal place to stop and order lunch in South Charlotte, but those usually end of being the best places to get your grub on!"}
