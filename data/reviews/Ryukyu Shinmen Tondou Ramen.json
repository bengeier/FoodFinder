{"text":"Got the garlic oil ramen and added an egg. It was so good. Broth was smooth and 'creamy' and the service is so attentive. The style is Okinawan, so keep that in mind if you're particular about the style you're going for. 

I came in on a Tuesday evening around 6 but it got busier after 7. Lots of seating options for lone dinners as well as groups as large as 6+."}
{"text":"Great tonkotsu ramen, not so great vegetable ramen. I thoroughly enjoyed my tonkotsu ramen with the rich broth, chewy noodles, perfectly combined with the toppings. Unfortunately, my friend who had the vegetable ramen did not enjoy it and mentioned that it had a very strong garlic flavour and not much of anything else. 

I also wish they would get some air conditioning because it's really not an enjoyable environment to be in on a hot day (when we went it was around 25 degrees and they only had the ceiling fans on)."}
{"text":"Recently a fan of ramen. Went here cause the place I usually go was closed. (I maybe have ramen once every two months?) I had the spicy miso with added eggs. Was actually really good and modestly priced. Calm interior and pleasant staff too. I plan to return with my buddies very soon. For the price and quality this place is 5/5."}
{"text":"Legit.  100%. 

I am not Japanese.  I am not a ramen expert.  I have, however, travelled extensively throughout Japan and have sampled a significant amount of ramen.  This is the real deal.  It's actually from Okinawa!  

If you like tonkotsu, this is like finding the holy grail in Toronto.  

Starting with the very first whiff of pungency from the broth... this is the smell of authenticity.  In Fukuoka, you smell this everywhere.  

We tried the tonkotsu ramen, the shio garlic oil ramen, and a bowl of the negi shio chashu don.  We were totally satisfied.  The complimentary marinated bean sprouts were really tasty too! 

Don't forget to press some garlic and grind the sesame seeds into your bowl!  

The noodles and egg are better than Santouka.
The broth is better than Sansotei.
The overall taste is better than Kinton. 
It's better than Isshin cuz there's no line (yet).  

This is a hidden gem!  Go go go!"}
{"text":"The place gets hot. Like, no-AC stuffy. The food's great, but...it's difficult when they don't have the proper climate to enjoy it. But on the other hand......perhaps that is meant to feel like how it might feel in a ramen shop in japan so maybe it's better that way!

When we arrived around 7:30, the restaurant was pretty empty. It's not a big restaurant, but it's not too small either (about 12 tables?)

Washrooms are pretty interesting: there's a men's washroom. And then there are two \"everyone\" washrooms. And the men's washroom is unusually large.

The waiter asked us if it was our first time at this restaurant, and asked us if we had any question about ramen or other items on the menu. When we asked what he would recommend, he picked the spicy miso because that was his favorite and he had it earlier. Definitely tried his best to answer hard-hitting questions like how big are the mini bowls vs regular bowls and how many slices of tonkotsu comes in each bowl. Also checked up on us from time to time.

While taking our orders, he also asked if we'd like to order any appetizers, recommending items that would go well with the ramen, and finally if we would like a round of beer because of course, it is a necessity.
We also received a complimentary jar of spicy bean sprouts as \"extra service\", which were tasty.

I enjoyed the ramen. The portion size is not amazing, but the broth was quite rich and satisfying despite the lack of portions for pretty much everything else: two thin slices of tonkotsu, a handful of noodles, some ground pork, mushrooms... it's a pretty small bowl. Actually most japanese-run ramen places in Toronto have pretty small portions anyways (to me, for $10+) so portion-wise, about the same as other places.

But that broth. Definitely something. Lots of flavor.

Also, they assign nicknames when they're taking orders and on your bill you might see a quirky name. I was given a number so that wasn't too interesting but the others at the table had some more amusing ones. Hopefully they don't run into trouble like some other restaurants."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I'm on the last lap of trying all the ramen vendors in Toronto and I'm very glad to have stumbled upon this restaurant.  I haven't seen any marketing trending for this place, but luckily it popped up when I did a simple search for ''ramen'' in Toronto on the yelp app. Hopefully, it'll be poppin' later on with some gradual traffic. 

SERVICE: 

Phenomenal. Takaashi was friendly, enthusiastic when explaining the menu, and was very hospitable.  He also provided complimentary spicy bean sprouts as appetizers!  

DESIGN: 

The restaurant is small, but it can fit large groups of six and smaller groups without crippling people's comfort levels.  The decor is quite simple, which is neither good nor bad. However, the restaurant didn't seem to have AC, so I hope they will install something within the next few weeks or it will be far too stuffy inside for the summer crowds. 

FOOD:

The server recommended the Spicy Miso and the Tonkotsu ramens. I opted for the Spicy Miso instead of my standard shoyu. I have no regrets because the broth was rich, creamy and very flavourful. It was a little saltier than most broths I go for, but the depth in flavour balanced it out well. Mind you, it was not actually spicy, but it had a good kick! The toppings were a little sparce, the noodle texture was underwhelming, the portions were standard, and the meat was thin.  Still, I would go back just for the broth! 

There's a lot of potential in this new ramen establishment.  My group had mixed feelings, but the general consensus was  that the broth was very enjoyable. Some even liked the rougher noodle texture, whereas I did  not. It's all based on personal preference I guess.  I'll be passing by in a month or two to try their shoyu ramen since that's my usual go-to for most ramen restaurants.  Hopefully, they'll have AC by then."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Ordered mini spicy miso ramen and deep fried octopus tentacles. Ramen was amazing. Broth was flavourful and rich. Pork was cooked better than other supposed Michelin ramen places. The free appetizer spicy bean sprouts were amazing! Super friendly staff. Definitely a go-to spot for ramen in toronto!"}
{"text":"I am perpetually on a search for the best ramen in the city. I was reading about the authenticity and great tasting ramen from Tondou Ryukyu Ramen, which has been open for about a month now. Thankfully for me there wasn't a wait at 4pm on a weeknight. The restaurant appears small and cozy but has an additional section of seating towards the rear of the restaurant.

The wait staff were polite and reasonably attentive. Spicy bean sprouts were offered as complimentary appetizer while I waited for my ramen. The sprouts had a nice sesame flavour and the spiciness was great for whetting the appetite. 

I ordered the mini shoyu ramen. The mini size was a perfect snack size for some but large enough as a small main for me. The ramen broth was flavourful and rich as you would expect with hours of boiling pork and chicken bones. It had tons of umami flavour as the collagen clings to your lips. The ramen noodles were chewy and al dente. I appreciated the cabbage and greens for texture and to help cut the richness of the broth. Tender slices of chashu had some fatty layers and allowed it melt in your mouth but it bordered on being a little too fatty for me. 

The major downfall for me was the saltiness of the broth but it may be because of the soy sauce used in the broth. I would consider returning to try the other ramen preparations such as the miso or tonkotsu ramen which I am hoping would be less salty.

They also have karaage, takoyaki, and nanban fried chicken for those needing additional protein with their ramen which I hope to try next time. Did I find the best ramen in the city at Tondou? Not yet. But with rich savoury broth and tasty ramen, it has potential. 3.25 stars."}
{"text":"Ah yes noodles for lunch. And such wonderful noodle soup.
The only thing I would change is that they should upgrade the tea service"}

The Caribbean decor suits the Japanese fair 
Giant bottles of Asahi only 11.00!"}
{"text":"New ramen spot opened in Little Italy! This one is definitely worth trying in my books :) Decided to come here because recently I saw an IG mukbang guru promoting this spot and she tried to tackle the Mega Ramen Challenge here at Tondou lol.

I think they have another round of Mega Ramen Challenge happening tomorrow June 14, 2018 from 5-10pm if you're interested! If you can finish it within 20 minutes, it's free! Otherwise you pay $35 for it.

What I liked about this ramen spot:

1. Fantastic service - always checking on how we were doing. They also offered us free a jar of house-marinated spicy bean sprouts to go with our ramen! Thank you :)

2. Mini versions of ramen available - finally I don't have to order a full size bowl of ramen! I ordered the mini size Garlic Oil ramen bowl ($10) and it was the perfect size for me!

2. Silky broth - the one I got was pork bone based. It was delicious and not too overpowering. The broth surprisingly did not start to curdle when I left it sitting after I was done - it is a good sign lol. The broth is not as fat I'm guessing?

3. Uses different types of ramen noodles: thin ramen noodles, egg white noodles, veggie noodles, and I quite enjoy the whole egg wavy noodles!

4. That pork cha siu tho - delicious, and pork to fat ratio was great! It did not feel too fatty nor too heavy (although on the thinner side).

I would come back again for ramen when I'm in the area :)
P.S. Warning: Their version of takowasa IS HELLA SPICY #iwarnedyou"}
{"text":"Great Okinawan style ramen shop! The pork belly chasiu here is easily one of the best in the city - super flavourful and tender

Love the nanban fried chicken as well, the sauce on it is amazing! As are the spicy bean sprouts which is both tasty and refreshing at the same time.

Owners are from the now closed Ryoji and knows what they are doing. This charming little shop is a downgrade in space (Ryoji was huge) but I think they have upped their game in terms of taste. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Having tried all of the Ramen places in Toronto (Santouka, Sansotei, Ramen Isshin, Kinton, Konjiki, etc.) ... I would say this place is definitely at the top of the list (for Ramen). 

Spicy Miso Ramen (4.5/5) - this was the highlight of the evening. The texture of the noodles were amazing (incredibly chewy) and the broth was extremely flavorful. I found myself licking the bowl at the end of it. 

Tako Wasabi (4/5) - pretty delicious! At the same time... it is pretty hard to mess this one up 

Nan Ban Fried Chicken (3) - it was okay at best. I found the sauce to be too oily and the chicken lacked flavor and crispiness. 

Negi Chasu Don (2.5/5) - the cha-siu was extremey dry and the rice had no sauce nor seasoning. 

I will highly recommend this place if you are craving Ramen - would not get any of the other items on the menu. Since this is a ramen place, I think it is only fair to rank them based on their noodles!"}
{"text":"Ryukyu Shinmen Tondou Ramen is a new ramen joint opened in Little Italy serving Okinawan Style ramen.

We walked by on a Saturday around 8 pm and it was not too busy with no wait and empty tables. We ordered a Mini size each to try.  

Spicy Tonkotsu ($9) and Spicy Miso ($10): Perfect size as a snack or even lunch as the broth is rich and heavy. The noodle cooked to a nice texture. 

I usually try to drink the broth when eating a good bowl of ramen as the star is usually the broth which takes hours to simmer. Sadly the broth here is just too salty and heavy for my preference. 

Service though friendly but the kitchen just too slow. We waited 20 minute+ for our ramen and it took 3 reminders to the servers about the beer we ordered. I really can't imagine how it would be if the place is pack.

Ryukyu Shinmen Tondou does have this lay back Okinawina vibe and have potential as a friendly neighbourhood ramen joint. Since it is quite new, I would not write it off."}
