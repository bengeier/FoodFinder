{"text":"This is a fine place to dine but nothing special.  I do appreciate that they have vegetarian chili which is the perfect topping for their taco salad.  The taco salad is good, as are the huge baked potatoes.  

Kids dine free at McAlister's on various evenings, but the kids menu is not great and the portions are for toddlers. 

This is a quick in and out, and in the winter a good place to grab a cup of soup, as the offerings change daily.  

The sweet tea gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"Sides were good. Pickle had crunch and flavor. Tea was good. Place was clean. Music not too loud.

Sandwiches were not very impressive. On par with subway, so way overpriced for the lack of quality."}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews, but love good sweet tea, so went here anyway. Glad we did! Our food and service was really good. We had the nachos and the club sandwich, both were nice hearty servings and tasted good. Since many of the negative reviews were more about the bathroom than their food, I thought I would check that out as well. The faucet is in bad shape, but they did have toilet paper in both stalls.... Yes I did look since it was mentioned in several reviews. They are hiring for all shifts, so I wonder if they cleaned house and now have better employees?? 
Sweet Tea Rules!! :)"}
{"text":"Most times the food has been okay. But last night the baked potato was so over cooked. It was brownish color inside and extremely dry."}

{"text":"Good food, wide menu, very friendly, good value."}
{"text":"Me & some friends came here for lunch but an hour pass by & we never received our food... we end up leaving because our lunch time was over... never coming back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"I love McAlister's but am highly disappointed with this location! First of all it says they are open until 10pm, well they are not apparently. My husband and I went on a Saturday night at 930pm walked through the open, unlocked doors to get all the way up to the counter for the young lady working to tell us \"Im sorry we are actually closed\". I said \"well it says your open until 10pm\" and she said \"no, we open at 10am\". Well Im not an idiot and its aggravating when you drive across town to be told a place is closed when it says on the internet in several places that they are open until 10pm. Please do some updating to reflect the correct hours of operation! Also, I figured all locations had the same menu, definitely not. Just disappointed in the location, not necessarily the food."}
{"text":"I know, I know...it's a chain.  But it's in the hood and it's GOOD!!  We have been there a handful of times and mostly like everything we have ordered.  I love that you can choose 1/2 and 1/2; meaning 1/2 salad, cup soup, 1/2 spud, 1/2 sandwich and use ANY combination.  That means you can try 2 different salads, 2 different sandwiches, salad & sandwich, salad & spud, etc.  Here's what I've had so far:

Savannah Chopped Salad:  Mmmmm... gorgonzola cheez....The ingredients were fresh but I would recommend changing the dressing to ranch.  Not a fan of the sherry shallot.
The Smokey Pepper jack Turkey grilled Sandwich:  Melts in your mouth!  There is a little tang but lots of flavor.  You can taste the bacon in every bite.
Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller:  The Chipotle Ranch is a little sassy!  Love it! I'm usually not a fan of \"warm\" guacamole (it comes on this sandwich and the sandwich is grilled) but it tasted fine and added that necessary \"moisture\", for lack of a better term, to the sandwich.
Cobb Club:  MY FAV!!!  It states on their online menu that they add mayo but I'm pretty sure the one here uses Light Mayo, which I love!  The gorgonzola (mmmmmmm.....) makes this sandwich pop in your mouth.  It's a perfect combo of all these ingredients without being too much.
Mac & Cheez:  You can get this as a side.  I have a rule to try the mac & cheez wherever I go.  This one was creamy enough but had a weird, industrial, mass-produced taste to it.  Not nearly as bad as some I've had.  Would I order it again?  Maybe...
Bacon/Cheez Spud:  Holy crap these things are huge!  I didn't know potatoes could grow that large.  It took three meals to finish it, as a side dish of course, but so worth it.  
There are still more items I'd like to try.  They have special takeout parking so it's easy to get in and out.  Happy eating all!"}
{"text":"I had pretty much given up on dining at this Deli but my wife likes a few of their items so we gave them another shot if she agreed to order. Reason being is that you call them with a to-go order and automatically get put on hold....why would you not have the person that answers the phone be ready to take an order or transfer if need be...

Sure enough after waiting about 5 minutes my wife had to call back and ask not to be put on hold and get the order started...funny thing they were able to take the order just like that....

upon arriving at the store and going to to-go register it took another 5 minutes to even be acknowledged....I actually got barked at the time before for stepping up to the to-go register while other people were waiting....

worst french dip I have ever had...it truly tasted like college cafeteria food...


never again.....if I could give zero stars i would"}
{"text":"Had the French Dip with mashed potatoes. My girlfriend had the McAllister's Club with chicken tortilla soup. 

French dip was pretty good but the potatoes and gravy was so so. The potatoes tasted like instant and the gravy was more of a southern style poultry gravy that used too my flour. 

My girlfriend enjoyed her sandwich but picked at the soup. It had a pile of green onion on top and she's not a fan. 

The restaurant was clean. Food came in a reasonable time. Staff was reasonably friendly."}
{"text":"I've never been here before and I was really craving a chicken salad, so I gave it a shot.  I was forewarned that I wouldn't be writing home about it anytime soon, but I still tried it out.  Definitely was not impressed.  The food was edible, but the management of this place seems nonexistent.

Everything is done on one register, including drinks and to-go.  My to-go order took me almost 10 minutes in line to even pay for because the employee had one speed: losing the race against sap.  

I called in ahead of time for a to-go and ordered the southwest cobb.  I asked for it to be tossed so I didn't get home with not enough dressing.  That was somehow difficult for them because the only thing not tossed within the salad was the dressing.  Umm, okay...?  The chicken on the salad was so cold that I think parts of it were actually still frozen (gross).  There was a significant amount of tough spots and fat on it to add (gross gross).  The salad altogether was just meh.

It really seems like they bought everything from Walmart and created a deli to put the groceries together in different ways and jack the price up while they're at it.  Overall, I think I would be more satisfied with Paradise Bakery on their worst day."}
{"text":"Food was good. Friendly service. Would come back again. Wish the sandwich was a little bigger for the price. The ice tea is sweetened just right."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, got our order and the food was wrong 3/4. Cheese nachos were cold, mayo and tomatoes on sandwich after ticket clearly said no to both, manager was out of sight and not very in the know of what was going on. Then took the food back and it still came back Luke warm. Not pleased."}
{"text":"This deli opened up relatively recently in Champaign, and I finally decided to give it a shot as we were driving from the mall to the North Prospect shopping district.  The drinks are huge - I had a lemonade and it was great, I hear the sweet tea is good too.  For lunch I had the pastrami on rye and I was pretty impressed.  A lot of people make the pastrami way too peppery, but this was just right - and they gave you quite a bit of it.  My husband had a grilled chicken club sandwich, and I liked it even more than the pastrami!  The pickles are good on the side, and my husband raved about the mashed potatoes.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their Chicken Tortilla Soup! Best ever. Kind and helpful staff. Thanks Jackson!"}
{"text":"Very, Very Bad. The food was bland and overpriced --- several orders got mixed up and the food was just tasteless. The employees seemed depressed and overall, I could not wait to get out of there. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite place. The French Dip was to die for and not very greasy like most places. If you are looking for a nice sandwich place, this is the place for you! Also, the mac n cheese is FIRE!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, its sometimes hard to find restaurants that offer tasty vegetarian options. I especially enjoy the veggie club sandwich. All sandwiches also come with a side, and I decided to try the mac n' cheese, but the cheese was too crusty and didn't taste right."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the valley. It's a fantastic deli that shames places like Paradise Bakery and Jason's Deli. 

Get the Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller or the new Cuban...they are my favorites on the menu. The cookies are so incredibly soft and yummy and you can get a free one just by checking in to Yelp!"}
{"text":"Love it, had it today the chicken tortilla soup in a bread bowl was amazing, plus the people were so nice and pleasant. Defiantly loved this location too!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location twice and so far, so good. 
Both times I've gotten a Roast Beef Melt, which I highly recommend! 
In all honesty, I normally eat at Subway, but when I really want a good hearty sandwich, I'll eat here. 
For my sandwich, drink (Which is HUGE), and chips, the total came to about $10.50. So it's about $3-4 more than the fast food chain, but to me, it's worth it. 
The staff has been friendly and informative and very accommodating to what I asked for. 

I usually take out, but the eating area inside has always been clean and there are tables that have loads of extra condiments and utensils. 

I wish I could eat here a lot more, but at 10 a pop, it's more of a rare treat than anything."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip cookies are so good. I recently had the bake potato with cheese, bacon, sour cream and onions it was so good and I would recommend ithe corn beef sandwich..."}
{"text":"Food was meh, nothing special. I was disappointed in the service since the girl at the counter had no idea the ingredients of any of the soups (which was listed on the menu I later found out). Tables were all dirty and the drink station was sticky and not very sanitary."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only are the sandwiches amazing, but they also have the best tea that I've had at a restaurant. I tried the pasta salad this time and I will definitely order it again. The manager was really nice and helpful, and he even cleaned up tables and plates. You don't see that at every restaurant. Overall, McAlister's is a great place to enjoy lunch with family and friends."}
{"text":"Used my birthday coupon today. Staff was great and the southwest cobb salad was terrific. You must try the wildberry tea."}
{"text":"Good, creative sandwiches but overpriced for what it is... Most sit down restaurants cost about the same and you dont get any sides or extras included (chips or fries)."}
{"text":"Fire the call center agents for placing orders and get the phone ordering back in the stores please! The call center messes up all the time and the angry customers like me lash out to the whoever is in the stores and it's not fair for them. They freaking messed up my order so many times! So please cut out the call center part and just put the ordering directly to the employees who is in the store. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"Ultimately a really nice place, I've only been here once but I enjoyed my experience enough to recommend a friend. Their Reuben wasn't anything special and lacked that certain \"zing\" that Reuben's have. If I had just had the Reuben I would've given it a solid 3 stars..... however after eating my average Reuben, I had their veggie spud. A true diamond of simple carbs and it tasted almost like broccoli cheddar soup from Panera except in a potato bowl."}
{"text":"Food is decent but when you order online you have to stand in the same line for people who didnt!!!  Whole idea is efficiency!!!"}
{"text":"I guess this place has been around a long time but my husband and I just discovered it! And what a discovery!! It's like Panera Bread, only MUCH, MUCH BETTER!! (Panera doesn't have yummy baked potatoes!) Also, management was VERY friendly and generous. I asked for a pickle and he brought me a whole plateful and didn't charge me for them! And their pickles are delicious!! We've gone here a few times, and each time I've ordered something different and have NEVER been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was great!  What a variety!!!  Not quite a deli, however worth the time and a sandwich!  The food did not take long and was hot.  I had a French dip.  Legit.  The black angus roast beef was so flavorable and the crack of the bread made it perfect! Five star service! Friendly and timely. I rate this five cups of soda, and two cups of au jus to go with all the amazing French dips that I will be having!"}
{"text":"Nice little lunch place to grab a fresh bite to eat.  Some highlights; reasonably priced goodness, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, and clean."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 04/27/13
===========================
After I wrote my review Kody, the manager at MCA, emailed me and enumerated all the changes they made with the food and layout of the restaurant to address the very specific complaints I had -- he offered to comp a meal to have us back and give it another try even just to try and make everything right.

We turned down the free meal, but went back again today to see if they really did change things and I can say they did.

My club came out freshly toasted (still warm), there were little trash baskets to get rid of our waste, the table-service was much more attentive offering refills and cleanup of finished dishes and my wife's grill beef was delicious (right amount of sauce mixed with cheese and grilled/served fresh).

Kody (who I have never met, but recognized him from his Yelp photo) came by and talked to each guest to make sure everything tasted great, what we thought, how we could improve the meal and other suggestions for future visits. Honestly, I don't think I've ever experienced such an attentive manager at a restaurant before except at Capital Grill (where I think it is required where as I think Kody does it out of a genuine desire to run a kick-ass sandwich shop).

Added 2 stars for the taste/quality of the food and for Kody -- having someone so passionate and willing to listen to and implement feedback makes the difference between a successful restaurant and something that dries up and flops within a year.

To be clear, we never introduced ourselves and were never given a discount/coupon or a comped meal. I genuinely see the changes they made in response to my feedback and look forward to future visits.
===========================


Been here twice in 2 months, both times really disappointed that the sandwiches I got were so dang average.

The location is great, beautiful inside, nice patio and great/extensive menu (as another put it, sort of trying to do the Paradise Bakery thing) but the food is totally average and layout of restaurant inconvenient.

First, the food. I have had the grilled chicken sandwich and the McAlister's Club - both times the bread comes out cool and unprepared in any way. On the club I had just now, the bread was toasted and cold... So it was toasted earlier (during a rush I imagine) and since cooled down, so now it is just hard and dry... Why don't more people understand that HALF of a sandwich is the bread?

The ingredients were fine, just total super market-tasting fare pulled from the fridge and dropped between two hard pieces of bread.

That's it... No grilling, no special cuts of meat or cheese... Just something I could have made at home for $2 (and I would have put more TLC into it)

Second, the layout of the store. You are handed a huge drink, lids and straws are behind you at a small table with no trash can near it so if you want to throw away the receipt you just got or your straw wrapper you have to go hunting. There is also a SINGLE stack of napkins here for the whole restaurant that you are suppose to pick up before sitting down. If you forget to, well now you need to scoot out of your booth and walk back across to the front to grab one with dirty hands.

Let me state, I realize how petty this sounds, but damnit, have some awareness of what your customer's experience is from ordering to eating to walking out. Don't lay the store out how you want, lay it out convenient for customers.

I haven't eaten anything here that would help me to understand the score the place has... The ambiance is great and I wanted nothing more than the food to match the experience."}
{"text":"I come here a lot as it's not far from work and the food is pretty good. I always order the same thing and usually don't have a problem, but I have had an issue with my order being wrong on two occasions in the last month or so. I get the grilled chicken Caesar wrap with the dressing on the side, and one of those times I had picked up my order and brought it back to my office and they put the dressing on the wrap which ended up making it sopping wet with dressing (which is why I always get it on the side), I just couldn't eat it. When I called, the manager was more than willing to actually bring a new sandwich to my office. I was impressed with the fact that he cared enough to go out of his way to do this. Today, I placed my usual order and went to pick it up. The manager knows my name now, and I saw him personally check this time to make sure there was no dressing already on the wrap. My guess is that he was just focusing on that one thing, he didn't realize there was no chicken on it. I get it back to my office, no chicken. When I call, I tell them it's fine, I can eat this, I just would rather have a refund than have him come down here with a new sandwich again. He apologized profusely, refunded my card, and about 15 minutes later shows up at my office with a gift card \"if I decide to try them again\". This is customer service, and other companies and restaurants in the area should follow this same sort of model. I can't praise the manager's actions enough for showing how much he cares and wants to keep me as a customer. For this, I'll keep coming back. Thank you for making me feel valued!"}
{"text":"Customer service here was top notch! Everyone was extremely helpful and went out of their way for the customers. The food was fantastic, the price was right, and the lemonade was divine. The ONLY downside is I wish it was closer to home. Nevertheless, we will be frequenting here more often!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Healthy whole ingredients. Great service! Deli is located in a prime location."}
{"text":"Tried this New Deli restaurant on the first day of their opening. Very impressed with quality of food and friendly service. They have plenty of healthy options to choose from. Offer inside or Patio seating. Very conveniently located. I would love to come back again."}
{"text":"Good food, good location and kids can eat for free on  tuesdays."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food you can get! Paradise bakery does not hold a candle to it! The food and the staff are  great awesome prices too!"}
{"text":"When we came through on our way to our gate, I decided to get an iced coffee.  After 2 of the 3 people continued to chat and ignore me, one of the employees finally asked for my order.  She then looked over her shoulder at the menu and told me they don't have iced coffee.  I then advised her to add ice to regular coffee and that would be sufficient.  She said \"oh\".  Don't waste your time or money here.  Cleveland is great and this place is not representative of our city's attitude or aptitude."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! I've been to the Albuquerque location numerous times in NM. I was so excited when this location opened up! Although, it led me to nothing but disappointment and I will not be back. Incident number 1: ordered salads, spuds, sandwiches to go. Completely did our order wrong I sent me off with a plain potato. Incident #2 thought we would try again. Eating our meal when I said the bread tastes funny.... Thought it was just me.... Table across the way looked disgusted, he had a soup bread bowl as well (although he ate his down to the bottom when he noticed it was covered In mold! Looked under mine and it was too.. Not sure if I was more appalled by the mold or the response from the workers. \"O ya, they must of gotten wet overnight and from sitting out\"... Ummmm? Gross! Ok rant over I won't be back I'm surprised they are still in business"}
{"text":"I've only lived in Cornelius for a couple of weeks, but I have been to this McAllister's a half a dozen times now. I've ordered 6 different sandwiches, some grilled, some club, and they have all been excellent. I always get their sweet tea, which is also excellent. Sweet, but not saturated with sugar to the point where you are crunching your tea. I will most definitely keep eating here."}
{"text":"i agree with Bob M...i first visit the order taker was not very helpful..food was just so-so..we wont return..when were in the mood for deli type food my wife and i both agree we will go to Jasons Deli,only a few blocks away and much better food and i think a little less expensive also.."}
{"text":"Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ordered club online. Asked for regular mustard and mayo. Asked for honey mustard on the side. No mayo or reg mustard at all. Sandwich drenched in honey mustard. Ruined, threw away. This is exactly  why I didn't want it on the sandwich. Since this was a to-go, I didn't know till I returned home. Too far away to drive back. Waste of time. Server Deanna was the only reason they received any stars."}
{"text":"Allergy friendly!  My kid can actually eat here! He likes it too!
The price is right at this location.  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday is 2 kids eat free with each paying adult."}
{"text":"It is ok, nothing to write home about. The food is typical, one step up from Subway. Beware going for lunch, this is place is CROWDED and it will take FOREVER to get your food. But, if you are looking for an average sandwich with an average decor, this is your place."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, each time the same experience: uncaring staff, poor service, and low-quality food. Each time I went, the general manager was sitting at the same table, drinking a soda and reading the paper. It is absolutely clear he does not care at all about the business, and is just there to collect a paycheck. My advice is to go to the site at Ballantyne Village; they have much better food, atmosphere and service. The Blakeny location is a lost cause, in my opinion."}
{"text":"So it's Veterans Day, and I had already eaten brunch at De**y's (which I will refrain from commenting on because they are honoring our Service members). My brothers wanted to go to lunch here, so I figured I'd ask if they had a discount for Veterans. I was very happily surprised. They provided me a sandwich/entree of my choice, 1 side, a large drink, and most unexpectedly, a dessert. 100% gratis. 
I got the chicken salad on croissant, and it was better than I thought it would be: cranberries and pecan chunks, the right ratio of sweet to savory, and the croissant was fresh. My side was cole slaw which was decent. They gave me a small bucket to put my drink in (ok, 32 oz). Their sweet tea is indeed all that. If you're from North of the M-D line, or if you just don't like your tea tooth-achingly sweet, do what I did and mix sweet & unsweet. Excellent. 
When the cashier said dessert I was thinking chocolate chip cookie, a-la Jimmy John's (which would NOT have been a bad thing - I love those cookies). But what I got was so much better -- NY style cheesecake. I must say, besides the kind service and the Veteran love, this is why I'm writing this review. This is my idea of good cheesecake: dry but not running-for-the-milk dry, not overly sweet, and rich as you like. And a healthy slice! 
Next year I'm skipping the grand slam and hanging out here. Thank you McAlister's: I will spread the love."}
{"text":"Had lunch at 2:15pm, ordered \"Choose 2\".  Had a French Dip sandwich, the sandwich was lukewarm, dip was cold plus they charged me $1.25 for the dip .  Had Broccoli cheddar soup, also lukewarm, they did warm it up for me.  Totally over priced 
$$$$$  Probably won't come back here again!"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice and am underwhelmed.  Not nearly as busy as other locations and they still seem to be behind.  Today it was dirty (tables and floor) and as we were sitting down someone promised to come back and wipe down the table.  It looked like it had been eaten at a couple of times without being cleaned up.  We waited about 10 minutes and then decided to clean it up ourselves.  Our food came and the French dip was pretty decent.  Lots of roast beef, decent roll, plenty of au jus for dipping.  Taste was good.  The club sandwich, on the other hand, was the second strike in a row for me.  The bread is so-so wheat bread.  I'd compare it to housebrand wheat bread at a grocery store.  There was a decent amount of ham on it.  There was enough turkey for me to be able to say that there was turkey on it, but just barely.  And I did find a scrap of bacon on one corner of the sandwich.  In other words, it was basically a ham sandwich on crappy bread.  Clearly, they have no idea what a club sandwich is supposed to look like.  We got the potato salad which was decent.  The fruit cup was a joke.  Two grapes, two small pieces each of pineapple, cantaloupe and honeydew.  

At other McAlister's the food is better, the place is cleaner and the service is better.  At the Arboretum there's usually somebody coming by twice during our meal to fill drinks, check on things, etc.  At this location, nada.  Second time nobody has come by.  It's closer at times but it's clear there are better places to go.

Shortly after posting this I got an offer for 2 free meals from their manager.  Nice that they care to reach out but why not turn things around FIRST.  I mean, did they suddenly correct their cleaning issue?  What about the \"fruit bowl\"?  Do you suddenly now get more than a couple of small pieces of several kinds of fruit?  Or do they now fill the tiny bowl?  Not sure I will take their offer but if I do, I will update this review."}
{"text":"Great food for the price and a very friendly atmosphere! I had the California Turkey Ruben and Tortilla soup. Both tasted great. If you want a quick bite, but do not want fast food then this is your place. You place your order and then take a number., the friendly staff then brings you your food and they stop by on occasion to ask for drink refills. I did not feel obligated to leave a tip and when I asked about leaving one they said a simple thank you would suffice. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome customer service!!! Sweet tea & turkey Ruben are my go to- amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I am continually amazed by those who comment about food preferences and service without considering the situation of the workers, (heed Cory S.). Most neglect them in these comments and detail your unsound dogmatisms about miniscule capitalist preferences to be had when you could actually talk about their conditions and advocate your preferred changes with their grievances instead waiting for an oppressive businessperson to serve you. Shame on you for blaming working people."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service here. Looking forward to a return visit,  since they are right around the corner from the house.

P.s. don't forget the free cookie upon yelp check in!"}
{"text":"Horse radish and roast beef sandwich with sweet tea rocks.


Good pastry selection, reasonable prices for airport food."}
{"text":"It is a hit or miss. When they changed managers and staff, continually, the service became good then bad."}
{"text":"Loved it. Super clean! One mile walk from
Home! Great family night out!"}
{"text":"A definite hidden Gem!! 

The wife and I stopped in for lunch one day and I instantly knew this was going to become one of my go-to's. The product is fresh, the portions are generous, and the staff is friendly. Well done and welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ordered our food to go  via call center,  then came and paid.  And waited.  After 20 Minutes we asked where our salads were and if they were ready yet.  Oh yeah,  here they are.  They were ready the whole time and nobody told us.  Would have been quicker to eat in I suppose.  This location has been having issues for the past year now.  Last time we ordered food to go they gave us the wrong sandwich and we had to drive back,  then they made the wrong sandwich again.  Something needs to change.  The employees are different as well.  Not friendly.  Just seems like grumpy minimum wagers. Not the McAlisters of 10 years ago..."}
{"text":"Love it I lived in Mississippi two years when I moved here me and my gf went 40 minutes out of our way to eat here and it's just as friendly as in the south, I had purchased a order to go on my way out for my brother in law when I got to the car I forgot that I forgot to say no mayo, so I went inside I did not take the previous order back in as I was willing to pay as I was the one who made the mistake but when the lady noticed me back she asked what was wrong and did not let me pay for it . Love the positive vibes"}
{"text":"The muffaleta was mediocre, lacking in any distinguishing characteristic. The employees need training in customer service. Not one ever smiled during our visit, ignored both my husband and I at separate times when we went to the counter, forgot our pickle, nearly tossed our flatware down, and had the air of being inconvenienced. The kid's meal is a good value. Not convinced we'll ever return. Jason's Deli beats it hands down."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would. This food was absolutely disgusting. My broccoli  cheddar soup was the worst thing I have ever tasted. Seriously I understand they want to be Panera bread but their food will never be on their level. The sandwiches were like a quarter size not even half. The tea tasted old. This place is terrible and everyone looks miserable. Next time I am going to Panera. Never again will I eat here. Who makes broccoli cheddar out of a can, they do. It was thick and didn't even taste like the real soup. Like wow. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and the staff is really nice and accommodating. They were out of potatoes and my wife is a celiac, but they made sure her order was filled even though they had to make her order special. Online app is awesome. Extra star for that alone."}
{"text":"Great new deli with fresh foods. Lots of different sandwiches and the salads are huge! Will definitely continue to support this fantastic deli."}
{"text":"I am a regular.  Best sweet tea EVER!  I am a true Southerner that needs her sweet tea.  I buy it by the gallon weekly.  I love their French Dip and Chicken Salad on Croissant.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Usually pretty busy still get food in quick manner great food service is good everyone there is helpful."}
{"text":"After driving since midnight, I stopped here at 11a for lunch. I ordered tomato bisque and half a spud to go. I asked for no sour cream with the spud. Not only did they not give me any butter for my potato, they also didn't give me a freaking spoon for my soup. I didn't check my bag before leaving the restaurant, as I normally only have to do that at McDonald's. 

So, because I don't keep spare spoons in my car, I had to pour my bisque on top of my potato in order to eat it. 

I also stopped in the restroom on my way out, and there was zero toilet paper in the stall I used. The restaurant opened 30 minutes before I arrived, so I'm guessing someone just didn't feel like checking the restrooms before the restaurant opened. I could understand if it was after the lunch rush or in the evening, but this was 30 minutes after opening. 

Thanks for killing my uber excitement to eat here."}
{"text":"\"The food is great. The service is NOT! They seem to be more concerned about their to-go orders and not the people standing right in front of them. Will not waste my time again. Too many other choices.\""}
{"text":"I love McAlister's,  the last I was there, I called in my order to go, when I got there they lost my order, so I had to reorder the meal, when I got home, I didn't get every I ordered. Other than no problems.   The web site, they need to  make it more simple for some of us who are not computer savvy."}
{"text":"This location has been closed for a long time. 

I'm not sure if it's being remodeled or closed permanently."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to place when I'm in Champaign. The people are friendly, food is great and the ice tea is wonderful. What makes it even better is they now have gluten free bread for a small up charge. I love the salads that are fresh and beyond the boring head lettuce. I've not tried any other places I this town of a similar nature, mainly because they are away from the shopping district. The restaurant is right in the middle of it all which makes its location very convenient. It's perfect for lunch or even dinner if you don't want a heavy greasy meal. My hubby and I love going here."}
{"text":"Average sandwich type food but AWESOME sweet tea.  Wish there were more of these in Florida by our home. Also sugar cookies are primo."}
{"text":"I ordered the McAlister club. With Mac and cheese as a side. The food was great. Their sweet tea is also pretty good. I felt like the prices were in line with the food and this area. Staff was pleasant, seemed a little confused about who does what and who rings on what register( seemed like a training issue) but overall I would come back. This location is at the great Northern mall but no entrance to the mall. Only from the outside. Seems like that might cause some slow traffic for them. I was there around 430. And there was 3 or so other patrons and a few more as I was leaving trickled in. I would  give them a 3 1/2 stars if that was am option."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, DELICIOUS sweet tea.
I've had both the turkey sandwich and the Italian sandwich and both were very flavorful. They don't skimp on the meat or toppings, and their sides are good sized as well. My parents love the muffaletta."}
{"text":"Nice and cosy on a Sunday. Lovely sandwiches? with cordial staff patiently waiting to assist on my order."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem here until recently and I've kept my mouth shut until now. Last night was the last straw. I'm wondering what happened to Ed, and that's just the start.

Last night, and one time before because I thought it was just a fluke, I got my usual. A sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Both times I got my food, the sandwich was fine. The Mac and cheese was so watered down that it was impossible to eat. My son had the kids nachos and the cheese wasn't cheese. My husband had soup that was worse than the Mac and cheese. Why is everything so watery?

On to the management. I've seen the big black guy doing nothing while the regular employees struggle to keep up with the customers. He just watches. The small blonde manager acts acts high and mightily and treats her employees like crap.

I don't think I'll be returning here. This store needs to get it's act together and get Ed back. Maybe if he was back the employees wouldn't look like they hated to be there."}
{"text":"Visiting from Vegas stopped by due to 4 star ratings and I'm glad I did!  Awesome for at reasonable prices and awesome portions."}
{"text":"Best McAlisters around! And they always have a great score!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! I always have problems with this location. I always hope they change but I guess not! Had bacon on my wrap that was so hard that I almost chipped a tooth. And the wrap was just plain nasty!"}
{"text":"This isn't the worst one I've been to in Charlotte but definitely not the best.  I had to toss my own ceasar salad(no modifications either).  Not the way things should go when paying $7 for a salad.  At least it was Tuesday and a free kids meal was included."}
{"text":"You most definitely have to try the Lemonade's as well as the Chicken tortilla soup! DELICIOUS beyond words. The spuds are good, just a little dry depending on your toppings. The sweet tea is nothing to rave about (unless I was given unsweetened by mistake). Overall great place to grab a bite for lunch or a lite dinner."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for the first time and I really enjoyed the McAlister Club Sandwhich and Mac N' Cheese. Good stuff, a bit pricey but good."}
{"text":"My little girl has a peanut allergy and they handle it pretty good here.  The food is good and price is fair"}
{"text":"Went here one night and our queso came out cold so we asked for it to be heated and the guy rolled his eyes and then brought it out and said \"oh my gosh it's so hot\" - joking and being very unprofessional.  Later during our meal, i pick up the pepper and there are 2 cockroaches behind it. We told a worker and we left- weren't even offered a refund. Used to love this place, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Miracle Mile. I love it. I recommend the sweet tea, McCallister Club and Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"We used to love McAlisters. After coming to this location today, I'm not sure if I'll be back. The cheese for the nacho basket was so dry it wouldn't get on the chips. It was congealed when they brought it to the table. We sent it back and they brought back more of the same. It used to be very liquid-like. We ordered soup and when they brought it to the table, it was extremely under portioned.  After going and asking about it, we were told it was because they ran out of soup. 

Were they not going to tell us that? What happened to this McAlisters?!"}
{"text":"Great service. The staff are sweet and helpful. The food is fresh and diverse so you can bring your picky friends if you like."}
{"text":"I love the friendliness of the staff here. They are more than accommodating. I like the variety of food and the portions are wonderful--always plan to take home some! The tea is so great--reminds me of my Tennessee home! The only drawback would be entering and exiting if they are busy...it's a little cramped getting past the line. Great experience AND a coupon to enjoy again!"}
{"text":"Praize Jebus McAlister's has arrived!  Sweet tea, delicious honey mustard and delish sandwiches."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this chain a few times around the country and they are always just bleh. Nothing special, WAY overpriced . Three of us had 2 sandwiches , 1 salad and two soft drinks $38.00- you've got to be kidding. This restaurant was clean, good service but only went there since it was right next to our hotel and we were to tired to look further. keep This chain as last resort restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok sandwiches. Need to try the baked potatoes or the salads.  Seems almost like \"fast food\" deli with real deli prices.  At least it's not Subway!!"}
{"text":"I eat here pretty often because I work nearby, the service has always been pretty good and fast. There's only one problem i've recently had, the pickles that come with my sandwiches have been sandy. When i bite into them, they're gritty and when i crunch it's like i' eating my pickle on the beach. I know it's not a huge deal but the pickles are my favorite of the meal. I've also noticed that some of the newer staff is rude and doesn't seem to want to help you at all."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Although it's a little pricey, I have to admit that the customer service is really good. I had a problem with some food, emailed the manager, got a prompt response and received a comp-ed meal. That wasn't even what I wanted, I just wanted to make sure that my order was correct the next time I went in. I will warn you, if you order to-go, make sure to check your bag before you leave. I have been known to get back to my destination and realize that I didn't have the dressing with my salad or the butter or anything for my potato. Overall, a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for 35 people. Order was delivered right to our office. The order was perfect and the caterer set everything up and brought us everything we needed. The catering team worked with us an gave us a perfect custom meal. Will order again for sure! Now that I think about it, I should have tipped the catering delivery guy more. Hopefully his boss reads this!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! The staff is really friendly and the food is amazing and pretty cheap for the quality you're getting!"}
{"text":"I went their last night to have a chicken salad sandwich on a Croissant roll. The Croissant roll was so over toasted, that it had a strong burnt flavor to the taste. The bread crumbled while I was chewing on it, because it was so over toasted. The sandwich was poorly made, and most of the chicken salad was clumped in the middle and sticking out of the sandwich. Between chicken salad falling out of the sandwich, and the bread crumpling, I was very disappointed. I probably won't be eating their again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were not disappointed. The staff was unbelievably friendly and the food was great! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful Rueben, shared one with friend and got baked Lays, plenty to eat and so goooooooooooood!!!"}
{"text":"Only had a dessert and coffee as we were waiting for our plane to board but we had a totally different experience than other reviewers...the people were nice, dessert was good and the decaf coffee some of the best we'd ever had...and it was fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm disappointed that I didn't come sooner. It's not in your typical location of 83rd ave and bell but totally worth stopping for lunch. They have tons of side options for your sandwish including mac n cheese. They also have a large range of non traditional delicious sandwiches. I love that they check on you while you are eating and refill your drinks. I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Best Sweet tea in Phoenix!  Great Nachos and awesome sandwiches, Chicken Caesar Wrap is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"This location is ok out of all of the ones I eat at. They have gotten better over the last few weeks. They now serve you your lunch on a pick two separately. Before it was all coming together which in some cases wasn't good. I always love there lemonade and the ultimate Nachos are my favorite. I order that with a salad or the ceaser wrap which is delicious."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat. They remodeled this location a while back and it is amazing inside. The food is always great. I order the salads, which are great. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They have the potential to be good, but the food and service isn't here at this location. Service is slow and staff unresponsive at times. If I'm going to wait a long time my food should be hot and tasty."}
{"text":"This place has gotten worse over the last year. The food is normally good however the dining area is always dirty. We walked past 9-10 dirty tables to find a clean one. 
The table we did sit down at wasn't fully wiped off. It was not very business as it was 630 on a Wednesday night
Lunchtime can be hit or miss. Sometimes the food is slow to come out and other times it fast. Most times you will find dirty tables and the management has turned over a lot in past year"}
{"text":"Great deli!  Every sandwich we've ordered is delicious,... the soup is great, too.  The service is prompt and courteous.  You order at the counter, and then pick it up when ready, but there are still servers wandering through the restaurant asking if they can get anything for us.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"We went here ordered take out in the restaurant. Food was average. Order was completely screwed up. Special orders DO UPSET THEM. Check you bill and order before you leave the shortchange you and overcharge you."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service,I had to practically flag down someone for a refill. When I got my food it was cold and inedible, the waitress said they didn't know what to tell me. I will never spend my money here again and will tell all my friends as family to avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"What is wrong with this McAlister's? I really want to like it and I have tried it 3 times now - each worse than before.

I have had a few of the sandwiches. Each time the bread was stale. They are really proud of their tea and charge a pretty penny for it. I got the New Yorker sandwich and there was some strange plastic string (or something) in my sandwich! My friend also had some 'unknown item' in his sandwich. On my last visit they were out (OUT!) of spuds and the unsweet tea was not fresh.

I won' t be going back......."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time last night and it was great! I went a few minutes before closing and they still had everything I wanted on the menu and it was still fresh! The employees were knowledgable about the menu and had great attitudes! I'll probably be going back tonight!"}
{"text":"For a chain and fast food they are one of the best at what they do!  You can eat healthy here or load on the calories.  The sandwiches are so large my wife and I usually split one.  We love the orange cranberry club and of course....their sweet tea."}
{"text":"We had to wait a little while for food but the staff was all super friendly and the manager was going around giving free meals to all the customers who had to wait awhile for their food. Food was delish! Definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The staff is incredible, and the food is always great! We eat here weekly and have never had a poor experience."}
{"text":"Love the Italian chopped salad with cherry vinaigrette and great selection of sandwiches to go with!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of McAlister's Deli and this location is no different. When I travel to Champaign, I always stop and eat here. The food is great and people are friendly."}
{"text":"Initially we really wanted to go to Mooyah, but after our bad experience there we decided to go against that and settle for McAlister's. And boy are we happy that we did that, we had a great meal and it was all very affordable. The people that worked there were such a delight and did their jobs well. The employees that would gradually walk around and ask us if we were in need of anything we're such a big help to us because we do have children and they do constantly ask for Stuff. The best part was as they didn't even seem agitated they seemed more than happy to assist us with whatever we needed, and my wife and I really appreciate that. Thank you."}
{"text":"Nice location  fast friendly service like you can order and then be seated 
Love the selection of sandwiches and their flexibility to do it your way"}
{"text":"McAllister's is always a great standby when you need a break from cooking. I've always been pleased with the food and the service.  Always clean if you decide to dine in."}
{"text":"Solid food in a nice, clean, and comfortable restaurant.  The New Yorker is the best thing I have found on their meu.  I'd skip the nacho basket and the mac n cheese, nothing to write home about on these two.  Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I think it's quite possible that McAlister's Deli may be the most overrated deli I have ever been to... ever.  Each time I go there (which isn't often), I leave feeling like I have somehow been ripped off.  I think their food is overpriced for the quality that you get and that's what irritates me about this place.  Maybe I just haven't been getting the right menu items but last weekend, I had a greek chicken wrap that was bland and full of nothing but lettuce.  The \"feta cheese\" in the wrap was either not truly feta or some really, really low quality stuff.  It had a mealy, gross texture and no saltiness to it at all.  Maybe it was goat cheese, but it didn't even taste like that either.  I dunno...I\"m just not fan and I would much rather go to Panera, Sub Station, or Owen's.  Oh and everyone raves about their sweet tea, but c'mon now, this is North Carolina...you can get sweet tea on every corner."}
{"text":"McAlister's Deli is pretty boring and doesn't have many vegetarian friendly options in general. But they have always had a really nice, helpful staff and service is fairly quick.

Decor is the same at almost every location, but I like it, perfect for a sandwich shop. McAlister's is also very kid friendly, that's the only reason I frequent here... whilst babysitting picky eaters!! Since the food is pretty bland, kids like almost everything on the menu.

I had the Four Cheese Griller... not bad as long as it's still warm. McAlister's does have one thing going for them... ICED TEA!

The parking at this location is limited."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is reasonably fast. However several chairs are broken (wobbly) and the facility is not the cleanest! My visit was at lunch, and the men's restroom had a roll of paper towels sitting in the water on the sink, the regular paper towel dispenser was out. Apparently someone was too lazy to reload the paper towel dispenser."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a location open up in NEO as I got used to having these all around when I lived in Cincinnati. I feel however the food is not as good as I remember it being (the last time I had it was a year ago). The chicken sandwiches that I ordered were just okay, nothing special. The service was pretty slow getting my order together the night I came, which I found interesting since I was the only one there and I ordered to go."}
{"text":"This place has good options for lunch and dinner. It is a seat yourself type of place after you order your food. I ordered the Pick 2 option which consisted of the Chicken Tortilla Soup and Half portion of The Cobb Salad. It took about 10-15 mins for my order to be delivered to my table. The salad was good with a good portion of meat included. The soup was a different consistency than I expected but the flavor was good overall. Not a place that I would come to often but I will definitely come back every now and then."}
{"text":"Meh the first two bites of my French dip was just bread and there was no wow factor. The fruit cup was nice."}
{"text":"When did Panera get so expensive? Back in the day my wife and I used to go there for a quick and casual sit-down. The last and final time we went it was like $30 for the two of us. 

Anyways all that to say that we're semi-new to the area and we didn't have McAlisters back home (all we knew was Panera and such). So a family member told us about McAlisters and we gave it s try. Really, really good! I get the beef w/ au jus for dipping. Great every time. This location in Baxter is really nice and quaint. The service is great every time and the price is fair. It's a cozy place to come to when you want something quick without feeling rushed. We love it. 

In terms of sandwiches it's neck and neck with Firehouse Subs. McAlisters will win based on convenience and proximity. I dont understand why Jersey Mike's is a thing - it's no different than something you can make at home with deli meats."}
{"text":"Having the Spud 'Ole. It's absolutely fantastic. Baked potato covered in chili, jack cheese, and jalapenos. Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Best customer service. Hector the manager was great also. The food is just as great. Salad, Sandwiches, Soup is all great. Will go back asap. New fav place."}
{"text":"This place is the best. We come here all the time and everything is great! Try the rueben it is ridiculously good! The Mac and cheese and B.L.T are even better. Great place!"}
{"text":"I went for free tea day and had a half soup with half sandwich. My meal was about $10 after tax. The tea was great and my meal was delicious. All of the flavors went well together. The baked potato soup had some cheese and free onions in it. I just wish they had the potato and kale soup I have seen other McAlister's Delis offer.

The restaurant was busy but the staff kept everything flowing. I really enjoyed my experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie with \"fresh fruits\" on the sides. Received two cold, dry pieces of bread with some super-scarce veggies inside. The sides? One would get fresher fruits in an airplane than what they gave me - some old frozen stock. 

All this for $7-something. Need a reason why these guys shouldn't learn from Subway. 

Overpriced, bland & more packaging than the real stuff's value!"}
{"text":"I went with a couple friends to McAlister's for dinner last night. It was my second trip there, and I have to say that \"A-OK\" is the perfect term to describe my feelings about it. If there were half-stars, I'd give it 3.5. I got the two-item combo ($6.95?), which gives you a choice of two items: soup, half-salad, half-sandwich or half-potato. I got the chef salad and the cheesy potato. Everything was good. I liked my potato, and the salad was also tasty. The portions were decent for the price. The whole potatoes must be gigantic, because the \"half\" order was huge. I also got a half-and-half iced tea (half-sweetened, half-unsweetened). That was pretty awesome, I'll admit. It's a huge cup for around $2, and we regularly had a staff member come by and offer to clear plates and give refills. 
Service here seems to really vary. I remember last time that the cashier was fairly impatient and huffy when I asked a question about the menu. Last night, our service was good - not fantastic, but solid. They did bring out the wrong combo at first, but it was a quick fix. 
I guess maybe it's my fault that I only feel mediocre about McAlister's. If I loved pastrami sandwiches, or ordered something besides a boring salad and potato, I might give it four stars. It really is a decent place for a quick, hearty meal. Still, it's the kind of place I'd go only if I were 'in the area' - doesn't warrant a special trip out of my way."}
{"text":"Food is usually good, take out was pretty poor today. Will have to start checking my order before I leave."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. Nice atmosphere too! It's still a sandwich place, but just different enough  to be refreshing."}
{"text":"You need to check your order at this location.  We been ordering to go from this location for a few years and I have to constantly check the order to make sure it was prepared properly and that all items that were ordered are included in the take out bag as usually one or two items end up missing.   

I relaxed a little yesterday when I picked up an order from McAlister's yesterday big mistake.    I figured both of the kids got Spuds this time Just a Spud with Bacon and Cheese should be easy right, don't have to worry about a missing Mac and Cheese or a sandwich done wrong.  Easy.   Nope Carmelized Onions mixed in the Bacon and Cheese on my Son's Spud.     

He wasn't happy as he not a fan of onions I feel silly because I usually check the food before I leave to catch these things.  So back to McAlister's where they did replace the food and said a quick sorry.  

Of course now I thinking about this experience the next day and I'm thinking why should I feel silly.   Is it too much to ask McAlister's to check the order and get it right the first time?  This is not the first time they screwed an order up.  We order online so we can be as clear as possible as to what we want and minimize the possibility of mistakes.  McAlister's really needs a better quality control process on their orders because I am not happy about having to drive back to get their mistakes fixed for just a lukewarm sorry."}
{"text":"This was my first time at McAlisters and I wasn't disappointed. Their portion sizes are extremely generous and their salads taste so good! I love that they have an oil and vinegar option for the dressing. Their fruit is also really good and fresh. Service was quick and staff was friendly. I definitely plan to stop by more often!"}
{"text":"Major props to John! One of the best servers I've ever had. He deserves a raise, immediately :) This location is fantastic, always great service!"}
{"text":"Food is average, I'm giving it 4 stars for the service. On par with Chick Fil A as far as being courteous and constantly checking on customers. Always a manager walking around. One of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Decent food. Poor customer service. Our team ordered $100 worth of food today. We drove 15 minutes to pick up the food. Upon distribution of the orders once we were back in the office,  we realized that a number of items were missing. We've ordered from McAlister's before and know that they offer delivery for large orders, so we assumed that they would be willing to deliver the items that we paid for but they missed. We called the store and the employee (Jerry) who answered the call seemed uninterested in resolving the issue. He basically said, you can come back to get your stuff  (a chili, drinks and side items) or we can offer you a voucher for a future order. The employee claimed he was the only person there (huge lie- it was 2 pm!) And they wouldn't be inconvenienced. So a team member had to stop her work to drive back to the restaurant to retrieve our missing order. They gave her 3 cookies for her trouble. And there were numerous employees standing aroind, doing nothing. Of course, by the time my coworker returned to the office, her food was cold. Our company (Ingersoll Rand ) spends a lot of money at McAlister's so we were disappointed to receive this less than stellar treatment."}
{"text":"McAlisters is amazing. However this location doesn't make their sandwiches with love."}
{"text":"I ordered the McAllister's Club to go with potato salad.  When I got back to the office the club did not have any cheese on it and it barely had any lettuce or tomato.  It was basically all meat and bread.  Not too impressed by that.  But the potato salad was really good and so was the sweet tea.  I emailed through their website about my experience but never received a reply so apparently they really don't care that I spent $10 and did not get what I ordered.  I will keep that in mind the next time it crosses my mind to go here."}
{"text":"Fairly fast service and good portion size! I got the Spicy Southwest Chicken comes with side of your choice. Really tasty but slightly mushy. Chicken fairly moist, not really spicy either."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the manager...however don't try to get in and out of here at lunch!  We have an hour for lunch and that wasn't enough to get in and out of a sandwich shop!!!  The cashiers are VERY slow and the kitchen doesn't move much faster by the time we got our food we only had 5 minutes left of our lunch so we knew we would be late getting back...the food is good, just be prepared to wait for it!"}
{"text":"Low quality sandwiches: cheap thin bacon, cheap meats, thrown together on ur basic sandwich bread.... A very dull sandwich 
Don't get the steamed veggies, they're as cheap as they can be
The bring the food out to you, and pick up afterwards too- well I hope so anyways...
A really nice environment, and great music... 
I won't be back... A shame, cuz I was really looking for to trying this place out..."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place today. I was coming out of Peoria Sports Complex and in the wrong lane so I turned in to the shopping center. I knew there were always good food places there when I lived in that area years ago. As we are driving and looking, we saw on the sign \"kids dine for 99 cents every day\". I had a car load of my normal clan with 6 kids in tow. Everyone was super friendly. They were peaceful with my large clan placing their order. Beyond this, once we had our food, they stopped by often to make sure we were all taken care of. I left there and recommended this place to my father in law who lives just a few blocks away. Super food. Super service. I would certainly go there again! OH - and my kids never finish everything... They not only finished their entire meal but also raved about how delicious it was!"}
{"text":"I've really started to like McAlisters a lot more due to the fact they are consistent and I like quite a few of their items.  I can get anything from their nachos, salads, soups, to sandwiches.  My favorite is usually getting the half four cheese griller and half taco salad.  

This time I met my husband and he got there before me and ordered for us.  Thank goodness because they were a little slow, but they are busy at lunch.  I only have so much time for lunch!

I got one of my new favorites on a chilly day, four cheese chilli, basically chilli mac!  It is very good and the portion size is great, it lasts me a couple lunches!  My husband gets a lot of things as well, but this time he got the turkey hot brown, very good as well and very filling.  You get a side with it and really don't need that since the meal is more than enough.  At any rate he got the mac and cheese and I just threw it into meal, making it more cheesy, yum!  I kind of wish they did the   4 cheese chilli with the mac and cheese instead!

The only negative with my meal, the cheesy bread or whatever it is that they served with it is very hard and crunchy, just not edible.  Even if it was soft bread I wouldn't need it, just don't serve anything with it.

I'll meet my husband here for lunch again!"}
{"text":"This was my first and probably last visit to this location. My husband ordered the Reubin on marbled rye. I ordered the veggie on 9 grain pita. It was about 730 p.m. We were so tired we didn't check our order before taking the 20 minute ride home. That was the second mistake, the first being choosing this restaurant over all the other places in the area we could have chosen.  My husband opened the bag and I knew from his reaction something was wrong with the orer.  The Reubin was on my pita,  what happened to marbled rye??! My veggie was on chabatta bread, exactly what I told the cashier I didn't want. Not only that,.. it was suppose to have multi colored peppers, balsamic red onions, and avocados. Sounded good on the menu. Well on the bread was lots of  lettuce, tomates, lots of thick sliced unpeeled cucumbers, no avocados,  one thin slice of red pepper. I had to remake the sandwich and slice the cucumbers, heat everything and dress and season it.  How do you get a Reubin sandwich wrong, and a veggie sandwich wrong? Incredible!  By the way the score there was 97...Beware.  If you decide to go to this subpar location and  carry out, check your order prior to leaving."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so I decided to try it for lunch. I feel like I've been missing out for months now! Awesome sandwiches, macaroni cheese and ice tea. I saw at least five other things I can't wait to try there. This might be my new go to place for sandwiches."}
{"text":"This cheesy bake potato came straight from the farm .can I get a moo moo hear and there . Chicken grillled yummy in your tummy"}
{"text":"Worthless, would not honor the lunch for veterans national promo.   Franchisee is despicable"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the worst place at CLE. Latte machine broken, the regular coffee is weak and more like tea, service is slow and unfriendly bordering on hostile. The bagel with egg I bought was good, but I would honestly pay double for a less tasty bagel at a decent place, than ever visit this dump ever again. It was _that_ bad. Do yourself a favor and go to the bagel place at the other end of the terminal, they have friendly service, good coffee and great bagels."}
{"text":"THE BEST ICED TEA EVER!!!  The food and service is fantastic!  We had past the place dozens of times always saying we should try it. Well we tried it this week and are now hooked. We got there at 11 am right when they opened. Though we were the second set of diners, the line on diners behind us seemed to never end. We were amoung a few tables that lingered over lunch, there was always tables open for the never ending line of customers. They also have a nice out door section that faces north, so no direct beating sun. 

The Savannah Chopped Salad, with grilled chicken, dried cherries, honey roasted almonds, and tomatoes is so good and the Ruben with pastrami was perfect. The menu offers everything from salads and sandwiches to soups and spuds. Not to mention some yummy desserts. The menu also features the calorie info both for the whole portion and if you opt for their Choose 2 (which is half of two items, for when you can't pick just one). The servers kept our Iced Tea full and did so with a warm smile. This definitely on our Favorites list and we will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Just as expected. Looking for a quality sandwich for lunch and the California Turkey Reuben hit the spot! Had the kale & sausage soup, also delicious but a tad salty."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service...I ordered online said it would be ready at 2:17pm, arrived at the restaurant at 2:20pm. Paid then sat down to wait...turned out my food was ready behind the counter; after waiting 25 more mins I asked if that's my order. Now the food is cold plus I wasted 25 mins after ordering online for 'simple, fast service'. Tons of staff working but not as a team. NEVER again..."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is like no other.  They are constantly checking on you to make sure everything is okay. This is my new favorite deli. I love this place."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write because I LOVE their food and selections and when they are on, it's the best lunch in Monroe.  

Having said that, service is incredibly Hit-or-Miss.  You'd think they'd figure out that they are busy on week days for lunch.  Plus, they push the order ahead but never have a dedicated person for that counter for at least lunch hour.  Heaven forbid you have a large order, some of the staff will make you feel like it's an inconvenience that you are dropping a lot of money with them.  It's been this way for years and through various managers, so I don't know if they just have a menu or format that can't handle volume or what.

Also...if ordering from the website, be careful because some stores don't have some of the items on the website and you would not know unless they call or when you get there.  Corporate needs to figure that out.

Nonetheless, I keep coming back because the food is good and not completely unhealthy, and can still recommend them for a good lunch."}
{"text":"The girl behind the register was a low talker and I had to ask a couple of times for her to repeat herself. Apparently, she couldn't hear me either because my sandwich had tomatoes even though I ordered it without them (I'm very used to this though). I asked the same girl what was in the chicken salad, she started looking at the register for the answer, luckily the other girl behind the counter was able to tell me. I ordered the sandwich and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. The chicken salad was mushy (too much mayo or miracle whip) and tasteless but the soup was hot and tasty. 
I gave the restaurant 2 stars because it's clean and beautifully decorated and another star for the soup. Other than that, it's just another sandwich shop and in an odd location."}
{"text":"I placed an order online and came to pick it up. Nobody even acknowledged me standing under the sign to pick up my online order. There was 1 employee taking a family's order at the register and the other employee was standing at the window to the kitchen with his back to the cash registers for half the time. There was a man also waiting for his to-go order and 2 families sitting down eating their food. The employee taking one family's order came my way to get a drink. I think a simple, \"someone will be with you in a minute\" would do but the sour glare was what I got. The employee at the kitchen window stood there until all the food for the man's order was ready and finally turned around and gave the man his order. The man checked it and was missing an item. 

Once that man got everything, the employee helping him asked if I was picking something up. I told him the name for the order and he turned around and got the only bag of food that had been sitting on the counter. They were out of the chips for one of the meals I ordered, which wasn't a big deal, so he wanted to know what other chips I wanted. He then brought me down to the cash register on the opposite side of the pick up spot to ring in the chip exchange, even though I'd already paid online. 

It wasn't the worst experience but I've experienced better. It was annoying and disappointing that the employees were so obviously uninterested in everything."}
{"text":"I was excited going into this experience because the menu has so many options and varieties of food. Being a vegetarian my options can be limited at times but McAlister's has vegetarian specific items...so i thought. To my surprise when I bit into my Vegetarian wrap, there as a large chunk of bacon. I have been vegetarian for my entire life and was appalled to this surprise. The staff offered to remake my meal but at that point I was uninterested and offended."}
{"text":"Always friendly employees. a little pricey forthe quality, but the portions are a nice size. I get my soup and salad fix here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and consistent. I order from here often and pick up because it is convenient. Every other time I am missing something or something isn't correct. A few weeks ago I ordered a choose 2 and was given a cranberry club instead of the original and when I was checking out the girl at the register told me that, that is what I ordered and she was very reluctant to remake it for me. ( I don't like cranberries so I know that's not what I ordered). Cookies have been left out of my bag, as well as an entire sandwich. But the food is good, and its in a great location so I go back, I just try to make a better effort to check behind them and make sure I have everything I paid for."}
{"text":"I'm very displeased with this service today.  I ordered the Mcallister's club and my sandwich bread was hard as hell and the wax paper was still in my sandwich.  Horrible use of my hard earned money and my short break time. Highly disappointed"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place. Fresh sandwiches, soups, salads. Try their loaded  baked potatoes and wash it down with their famous fresh brewed iced tea. Last time I was there we counted 10 people walk in to buy a gallon jug of tea to go. Sides of mac and cheese are delish. Top notch service.  I have yet to try a dish I didn't love and devour.  It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food would seem a lot better if the workers would quit complaining out loud about their jobs.  Also, people assume things like toilet paper would be in the stalls.  Maybe the worker should work more and quit assuming they should be paid for no work.  My meal was ok but there weren't very many people in there.  I used to love this place.  I expect it will close soon with so much apathy."}
{"text":"Typically, I enjoy McAllister's. They have a great turkey and tuna sandwich (separate orders). And really good cole slaw. Except this one time I went to this location, on Park Rd, and the cole slaw was slimey. Like someone had spit in it. I have not been able to go back since. The other locations all get high marks with me."}
{"text":"Excellent service, sandwiches, cole slaw, ice tea, seating, location- it makes for a great spot to eat a leisurely lunch with a friend.  The parking lot may be a bit tight at times. I recommend carpooling."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. The service is great, the food is even better,  and the tea? I'm surprised tea that good and addicting is even legal."}
{"text":"While I love the hot sandwich and soup combos here, the staff simply cannot keep up with the lunch crowd. They are slow at the registers and they just don't bus the tables much. I could not find a clean table during lunch so I cleared the dishes from one table and moved them to the next. I hope this location hires more staff soon."}
{"text":"Fabulous service & sandwiches & sweet tea!
I loved the turkey cobb sandwich--focaccia bread, savory turkey & avocado & mustard!! We ordered a school lunch for my students and the managers were awesome about coordinating each individual order and preparation of the meals in time for my students' luncheon. Truly they are a restaurant that shows they care about the customers' needs. I love the sweet tea and always mix half unsweetened with the sweet tea.  Cookies are phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Spuds consistent duds, which other locations do them right.  Never should a potato be anything but fluffy and hot.  Soups are always tasty, however, smalls are small.  Iced tea always always always awesome.  Nice they have outside seating, so bring a pet.    Sandwiches do not offer much meat, which is crazy noticeable with no lettuce or items to fill it up."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time...first time, food and service were great!  Came in today and was immediately asked what we wanted to order.  It's a big menu, so I needed time to view the menu but felt pressured by rude cashier, Makayla T.  Made my order, she rolled her eyes, ran my card, and tossed it back to me.  She was just rude which is a bummer because I'm local and the food is great.  I'm sure I'll be back, just hopefully on her day off"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch when I'm bored. They have pretty good sandwiches and salads and wraps. Staff is nice and always welcoming. No complaints"}
{"text":"Went for first time yesterday and VERY impressed! Tons of meat on a great tasting sandwich. Delicious potato salad. The prices were very fair. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This was my first time at McAlisters. I enjoyed it enough but it didn't blow my socks off. I split a Ruben and a salad with my friend. The Ruben was pretty good, as was the salad. No real complaints here. Decent food as a fair price. If I was in the area and craving a sandwich, I'd definitely pick this place over Panera. That said, it's nothing revolutionary."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like Panera Bread without the pretentious feel.  I really liked this place, they have a very friendly staff and good service.  Plus the food is out of this world.  Their cesar salad is a great addition to any meal and their sandwiches are quite impressive.

I have to mention that their chocolate spoon cake is not for the weak of stomach.  It is very thick and rich and has been known to cause spasms in those with a low chocolate tolerance.  But if you are up to the challenge, my fellow chocoholics, it will certainly give you the high you've been jonesing for."}
{"text":"Good salads and sandwiches are McAlister's  menu--I like the taco salad and the chicken salad sandwiches. It's chain food but it's healthy salads and spuds. I enjoy their tea and their turkey club sandwiches too. This location is in the south side of town but I like other locations for better service."}
{"text":"This is a little more than a traditional deli, and a little less than a sit-down restaurant. I suppose that makes it a standard lunch spot, which explains the menu being heavy on sandwiches, soups, and salads. Obviously that is their forte, but there are some alternatives for the lunchtime adventurers: pizzas, for instance.

I went for the Greek chicken pita thing. I should have anticipated the olives, so I won't deduct there. And once I had picked them out it was enjoyable. A little bland, but we'll put that down to my olive problem. The real fault here was one of ergonomics. The pita construction was simply unmanageable. Lettuce, feta, and chicken went flying with every bite. In the end, I mopped the contents off my plate with ends of bread.

It fed me though. And despite the challenges I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great baked potato but huge. Need to split it or order half a spud. Staff pretty efficient and nice seating area right next to deli. Have multiple varieties of potato specials, sandwiches and some salads. Was going to take remaining potato on plane for flight but too messy even in box it cane in. Probably just as well as may have needed seatbelt extender. Would definitely go back and try another variety."}
{"text":"I love McAlister's Deli. Friendly people and great food! I like everything on the menu and their generous portions. Attentive wait staff is willing to get you refills on drinks or whatever else you might need with your meal. Final thought... Very clean and upscale interior. I always notice how nice it is inside when we eat there.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of delis.  Cold cut sandwiches sound so boring to me because they're something I can make at home and usually bring to work for lunch.  So to go out for lunch at work and pay more to get the same thing is very unappealing.

Tagging along for lunch one day, though, I went to McAlister's Deli.  I was very impressed (and overwhelmed) by their menu.  Not only were there cold cut sandwiches, there were hot sandwiches, salads, soups, and baked potato options, as well as full-on hot comfort food entrees like meatloaf and roast beast with gravy.  I loved seeing the corned beef and pastrami on the menu.  Mmm...  A lot of sub/sandwich shops don't carry those two meats, preferring to stick with \"the basics.\"  I went with the Muffaletta, though, because it's fun to say and sounded yummy.  Half Muff, please!   

We returned on another occasion and I wanted something fairly light, but it was also a chilly day.  The soup and salad combo did the trick.  I was one happy boy.  

The entrees are good-sized and there is plenty of seating so customers aren't all on top of one another.  Your party can have a little privacy and enjoy their lunches in peace with the help of half-wall room dividers."}
{"text":"Clean place, nice friendly staff, good service-BUT WAY overpriced for what you get.  I have been a few times (work related) but not sure I would spend my own dime.  For example, 6 bucks for a \"bowl\" of soup, that was only filled 3/4's.  An $ 11 dollar sandwich, not much bigger than a Subway 6 inch.  Again, overall, good food-but given its fast casually just much $$ for what you get."}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION WASN'T BAD. Came here for a work related lunch. I don't like McAlister's because in the past the food hasn't been that great for the price. I mean across the street is Panera Bread. Same price and the food is just better. This time the food was good. Maybe I was just hungry, but it was good. Small portions for the price though. I did leave hungry after getting a grilled flat bread and a SMALL side of mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The employee who helped us at the register (it's her first day on register) has zero personality whatsoever. We are done eating at the moment and she has looked at me several times. I know she knows we are finished with our food, but she has yet to come over and acknowledge our finished plates. My friend (and a gentleman from another table) had to get up to get more drinks. An employee who was about to sit down to eat helped my friend get a refill. No one has even come over to make sure nothing was wrong with our food. 

And I found out McAlister's doesn't sell the Magic Brownie Bars anymore. I'm so very sad about this. Those were amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and made it right before the big lunch rush. I'd recommend coming early, this place gets packed! 

There's not too many new things I can say. It's your typical McAlisters. But it's new and clean which makes it more exciting. Well, at least it does in my mind. 

Most of the time when I come I order the Choose Two , you really can't go wrong with any combination. This visit was no different. I ordered the veggie spud and nachos (without the chili). The food was excellent. It was prepared correctly even with my modifications and I had more than enough for another meal. 

One additional note - everyone  here is super friendly! I really hope it stays this way! It's such a nice addition to the area!"}
{"text":"The service is great and I really like their food. There are plenty of choices on the menu and everything I have had there has been delicious."}
{"text":"This was only my second visit to McAlister's and it's not that I don't like this place...it's just that it's never a top choice.

I find McAlister's to be just like any other typical deli setup. There's your regular variety of sandwiches, salads and soups. A great bonus is that there is also a \"Chose Two\" option where you can combine soup, and half salad or sandwich.  

For lunch, I went with the Chose Two, I ordered the Chef Salad with honey mustard dressing on the side and the Club Sandwich -- add jalapenos (of course). I arrived right at lunch time, so I expected there to be a wait, and of course there was; but the food still arrived quickly. 

I enjoyed the salad, I chose to substitute romaine lettuce, and the mix of turkey, bacon and cheese with the honey mustard dressing was classic and delicious. However, the sandwich was just a little underwhelming. There was just not a enough meat or honey mustard dressing for my standards so it made the sandwich a little to dry for my taste. 

Overall, Panera Bread still has my heart, but I will give this place another chance to win me over."}
{"text":"I eat here 2-3 times a week.  Double stamp Mondays! Sunday brunch!  Thursday nights. 

People are awesome.  Fiona is amazing.  Food is amazing too."}
{"text":"Service was quick and staff were friendly. I hadn't eaten here before and thought it was going to be more of a unique little deli than the chain I realized it was once we went in. Our food was okay, nothing special but nothing to complain about either. I'd come back again in a rush or with the kids."}
{"text":"I love McAlister's Deli and it's great to have one nearby. The kids meals are only 99 cents every day, which means my family, which includes four kids, can eat here for under $20! The food is delicious, the sweet tea is the best in town, and it has a great lunch atmosphere for casual or business lunches. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We regularly order take out salads. I have had to resort to checking to make all of the ingredients have been added. Many times one or more items will be missing. Does't seem to be a concern when brought to the staff's attention. Wish there was a Panera Bread in the area."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwiches...tender meat and full of flavor! The potato salad is very good but I wish they offered fries as a side."}
{"text":"Best deli shop EVER! The taste of these sandwiches is so unique. The olè spud is the best one."}
{"text":"Went there today and ordered one of their potatoes.  It was supposed to be a baked potato with beef and cheese \"The Angus Spud\".  IF, and I mean IF, that potato was backed in the last 3 days I would be amazed. The inside of the potato even with the juice from the beef - which there was precious little of - and even with the melted cheese which was actually crusty, and with the extra butter I put on it, was gritty, grainy, and choke you dry.  NO WAY a potato gets like that without plenty of time and overcooking.  The skin on the potato tasted burnt and was actually tough to cut with a knife. For this one VERY dry, VERY poorly prepared WELL AGED - aka stale - potato they charge $9.50!  For one potato! One VERY poorly prepared and presented potato."}
{"text":"Bacon at this place is amazing. I would recommend any sandwich with bacon. I didn't try the Spud but it looked tasty. Not the best option if you want more of meat though. The 2 halfs for 8.99 is a good offer, although watch out for the premium sandwiches because that will cost you 1.5 extra. All in all really fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"By far one of the best sandwich places ive been to. So far ive tried 4 different sandwiches, the Memphian being my fav so far. Im disappointed they did away with the sweet greentea ... why i dont know ugh ... I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"This is a good deli, and I can go and get a cold sandwich or I can also go and get a warm bowl of chili. They have a huge menu, and portions are very large. Their spuds (like a 4 pound potato!) are really filling and very delish! Good service to all the locations I've been to. (Ballantyne & S. Tryon off the 485.)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit for lunch. Sandwiches are a good size and they also offer spuds and salads. I typically get the grilled chicken sandwich, the chicken is well seasoned and the veggies are fresh. I also partake in the spuds either the grilled chicken or the bacon. Both are Great. Expect to spend around $11-12 which would include a drink. Great for a quick lunch. This is one one of my favorite locations around the city they are very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The McAlister's Club with mac and cheese and a sweet tea makes for a winning combo. Not to mention the amazing honey mustard that you can only find here. This is your typical McAlister's, but the wait always seems to be a little longer at this location."}
{"text":"Their muffaletta has brought me back on many occasions.  The perfect lunch sandwich if you like ham and green olives.   

I also like that they don't accept tips and if you tip anyway they donate the money to charity."}
{"text":"McAlisters has a lot of competition when it comes to this \"deli\" type food. They tend to run in the middle of the road in quality and price. The cashier was patient with me while I made up my mind to get the tortilla soup and a cheese baked potato. The food came quickly and the potato was good. The soup I could have done without. The chicken tortilla soup I guess had chicken? It was also a thick soup and I prefer my tortilla soup to be thin broth.  Overall a quick bite when you need it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Lots of flavor and their bread is so fresh. They do not skimp on the ingredients. Potato salad is like grandma use to make. Highly recommend if you want a really good sandwich."}
{"text":"I am consistently underwhelmed when I go there. Quite honestly the only reason why I dined at McAlisters today was because I was invited. Otherwise I would have chosen another lunch spot. The service is good, The food comes out fast but the quality of food is lacking and the decor is insulting. Think Scottish kilt meets a cafeteria in an Irish Pub. Plaid, Formica, plastic plants and antique nick knacks run amuck. 

Today my Cobb Salad was all lettuce with small amounts of chicken and blue cheese that were hanging out with yesterdays tomato's. Are you excited by that? I didn't think so.

I will say one person at my table had the 1/2 French Dip and a Loaded Baked Potato and he said it was great. If I ever make it back over there maybe I will give it a try."}
{"text":"I was able to attend for the Friends & Family Grand Opening event --- it was an extremely hectic day, and their \"test run\". The training they put in paid off because everything went smoothly. The line was running quickly, and the wait for food was maybe 5 minutes or so. Everything came out hot and fresh. They're offering a full menu at this location, which is great. The location is a bit small, with not much seating inside. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend McAlister's!

I love grabbing the you-pick 2 for $7.19 deal. You can get 2 of any 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad, or 1/2 spud. I'd definitely recommend the Southwest Cobb salad, or the summer berry salad if they have it. For sandwiches, my favorites are the Southwest Turkey Melt or the Orange Cranberry Club."}
{"text":"Good food. Average pricing. Free Wi-Fi Internet. 

Nothing special, nothing bad to say either.  

Try it..."}
{"text":"I really want to like this location... They are always very nice but EVERY SINGLE TIME I stop - it's completely empty and I end up waiting 15 to 20 min for food... Sorry guys but you are losing a ton of business !!!"}
{"text":"Ok let me just start off by saying the older lady named Marcia needs to be fired! I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or what her issue was but she was rude to the customers including me as well as her coworkers! I walked up to the counter and there was no greeting like what can I get for you or how is your day going nothing... Just a blank stare so I asked about the Mac and cheese and she snottily replied back with its just our Mac and cheese. As she rolled her eyes at me. It made me feel really uncomfortable. So I quickly just decided to get a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup instead. Then another person in my group steps up and orders her sandwich then she snaps at her and says what do you want as your side like it was such an inconvenience for her and then rolls her eyes again and says it's on the board behind me. Please note this was our first time here and we had no idea what we were ordering. So we pay and get our food which was okay. But after our food we decided that we wanted refills and wanted to try their delicious cookies as well this time we got a younger girl named mikayla that was so sweet and polite! The phone starts to make this weird noise so she turns to Marcia the rude older lady that helped us the first time and asks is that the phone making that noise? And Marcia responds snottily again with I don't know but I don't have time to check. When she was standing there doing nothing! So at that point the young lady turns to us and rolls her eyes. Which made me think that the rude lady acts that way all the time! So ridiculous how rude she was! We felt so bad for the nice young lady! I most likely will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Busy lunch time but order to table was quick. Host Peyton was friendly and efficient. My salad was well-prepared  and amply portioned. Vegetables were fresh and crisp. I'd have liked to have been offered ctac j ers or bread to accompany a salad this size. I liked that the dressings are served from condiment d I sh as if prepared on site instead of the impossibly difficult to open packages. Prices were reasonable and variety of food options made this a good place to pop I'm for lunch while running errands in the area."}
{"text":"This is not your typical sandwich shop. They've got sandwiches sure to please any palate. This comes from a picky eater who has to have variety. They've got got enough food variety to keep your picky tongue satisfied. I speak for myself when I state that I do not like sandwiches and eating at the same places continuously. I am in a roll with this being day number 3. It's that good! Don't forget to try their great sweet tea or Arnold palmers. Do yourself a favor and give McAllisters deli a try. You'll like the value you get that overpriced sandwiches fail to provide. Thank you so much for opening more of these in the valley. I am a southerner and have always loved it here. Thanks again from a very satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I really don't like sandwiches very much but this place makes me break my rules. I love their cheese steak sandwich and pot roast sandwich. They have colossal spuds that are by far the worlds best. The menu is full of great eats.  They have the best sweet tea in town and that's no joke! Simply order your meal and relax a little cause this place is just as relaxing as being at home. I love coming to this place to meet people and for a sweet intimate date with my wife. You can keep your paradise bakery and wildflower bread company cause they don't compare. This place is sure to please whoever you to take with you.  


P.S. Mike please open a franchise at the Chandler Fashion Center. I drive nearly 30 miles to eat with you all and would be here more frequently if you all were closer by. Chandler Fashion Center would be a great location because corporations such as Intel, Ebay, Fox, Expedia, etc... have corporate locations in less than 10 miles from that mall not to mention a lot of new housing. I can promise you that area is profitable as well as Scottsdale and Tempe. I really hope you plan to expand in the Phoenix metropolitan area! I am from Texas and places like Mcallisters would let people in the Phoenix area know what good food they are missing out on. Thanks for investing in Phoenix and bringing such a great place out here. I love it!"}
{"text":"I love the peach tea, which is what made me return here.  That being said, I ordered the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich. There was barely any meat on the sandwich at all.  If you want to eat bread, with a flavoring of BBQ sauce, then go for it.  But for $8-$9 for a sandwich, there should be meat."}
{"text":"They had good food, fast service and were relatively cheap."}
{"text":"Used to be impressed with this place. Not any more! Went there for supper on 8/27/13, 7:45. Wife and I ordered soup and sandwich with drinks.  $18.76 for a cup of soup and a sandwich? Wow! 
 I ordered a \"Big Nasty\". I have had this many times and always enjoyed it. Not on this nite. Waitress brought our meal and my sandwich consisted of a sliced bun with beef on top....... No gravy, no cheese! When I asked the waitress what this was, she looked very confused. When wife asked about the gravy she looked more confused and the said \"Oh, you want gravy?\" And promptly left. She returned a few minutes Later with a small cardboard cup with a small amount of gravy in it, which she sat on the table and walked off. No comment....
 I poured the gravy on my sandwich and commenced to eat it without the cheese. One bite and I found the gravy was cold. Not room temperature cold mind you, I am talking refrigerated cold! My wife lost it and grabbed my plate and went to the counter. About 5 minutes lated the waitress returned with a correct \"hot\" complete sandwich. She hung around apologizing while I ate and returned 3 or 4 times to apologize more. 
 Some guy came by to ask us if we wanted more drinks, when it was quite obvious we didn't. In hind sight that may have been a manager. Not quite sure.
 Not a pleasant dining experience to say the least. Waitress did not have a clue and management was........was not!  

I went to the McAlister web site to do a survey. It requires a store code from your receipt. No such code on my receipt!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times in the past but recently the employees are asking too many times if I'm ok?  After 6 times interrupting my lunch..I must say....I am questioning if I am ok.  Since this is the kind of place you order your own food then sit down to eat....I think it's fine to assume we don't need that much more assistance."}
{"text":"Today was the second time I've eaten at this location, both for lunch.  They have extremely enthusiastic college students working here, like enthusiastic to the point of being annoying (I don't need a refill if my glass is more than 75% full), but it's better than being ignored. 

I've had the southwest chicken sandwich, southwest salad, french dip and veggie soup and all were pretty good. The southwest sandwich being my favorite. It's strange that they have lots of items on their menu online, but a limited selection at the store (I tried to plan out my meal before going to stay healthy, but 90% of the things I selected online weren't at the store.) Maybe I can order off menu next time. 

The prices are very reasonable and it's 'real' food in a quick time frame. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Out of all the McAlister's I have ever been to, this one is by far the best one! The service was PHENOMENONAL!! I haven't seen service so good in quite a while. My food came out extremely fast and absolutely delicious!  The manager even came up to ask about my visit, as well as informed me of the exciting new changes they will be making to their food. He certainly knows how to run a restaurant!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Totally understaffed. Been waiting at a table for 35 minutes and counting. Manager cooking and had two people get free meals since being here. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches. Husband loves the sweet tea. The service was great. We went on a Sunday and it was extremely busy but the line moved fairly quickly and we were able to find a table."}
{"text":"So today I'm having lunch here and I have never seen such disorganization. I don't understand how you seem to never be fully staffed to handle lunch time. It gets worse each time I've come here lately. Over half of the tables that are available are dirty. You only have two people working the register at lunch time on a Friday. Seems like this location need some work."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Big huge stuffed potatoes, pasta, hearty salads, unbelievably tasty sandwiches. The service is always very good as well. The place is always clean and the atmosphere is fantastic. 

The only problem is that some of the food, mainly the pasta's are a bit overpriced. Also, the BIGGEST problem is that they close at 8:30pm! I know, this might not seem like a big deal but being right behind the Padres/Mariners spring training field and right off the 101 in the heart of the arrowhead entertainment district, you'd think they'd be open till at least 10 or so, at least on Weekdays and maybe Saturday? 

Catch them at lunch or for an early dinner and if you don't mind spending a few extra bucks for the pasta you should be just fine. I've never regretted a single visit here and I'm sure neither will you!"}
{"text":"This location of McAlister's seems smaller than some of the other locations I have been to... but maybe it's just because this place has been pretty packed on the occasions I have been here.  They get pretty busy around lunch time on the weekends.  The menu and service are pretty standard here."}
{"text":"We stopped in over the weekend while doing some shopping at Carolina Place mall. I had never been to this location before but found the food to be the same quality and consistency of the other locations I have visited (Ballantyne, Blakeney, the Arbo).  The place was packed since it was around lunch time on a Saturday... but we found a table and they got our food to us pretty quickly.  The employees were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"McAllisters is consistently good. Varied menu. Clean and tidy. Busy. The staff are pleasant. Only complaint is the wait time for a to go order. Waited 15 minutes. Two people came in after me and placed orders and got them before me. Other than that I will continue to frequent this store"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches, soups and drinks. Can get crowded and a bit pricey. Parking is terrible now that Burger King has taken half their parking spaces. Very similar to Jason's Deli without the salad bar. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"McAlister's Deli is awesome!

It's right in the busy PV shopping area... always plenty of parking.

The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always very clean.

The food is delicious and the portions are a nice size.   

My favorite sandwich is the Roast Beef and Cheddar with horseradish sauce.  Simply divine! 

My favorite is the Savannah Chopped Salad... it's HUGE and filled with cranberries, almonds, chicken, cucumbers, etc.   It's REALLY super good.

I order catered lunches for my office occasionally and they've never let me down!   They have a really decent baked potato bar (for catering) and the potatoes are as big as my car.  The salads are always fresh, the sandwiches are satisfyingly big and delicious.

It's a great lunch place... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here a couple of weeks ago for lunch, as he works in that area.  Parking was a bit of an issue, since it's in a busy strip mall, which restaurants & a Starbucks directly in front of it.

I absolutely love McAlister's, I always get the same thing: BLT with potato salad & a sweet tea.  I have noticed that each location I go to, they make the sandwich a different way. Some slather mayonnaise on the bread, there are HUGE pieces of lettuce, or the tomatoes are sliced too thin/too thick. This particular location did the huge pieces of lettuce.  The potato salad was delicious, as always. That item stays consistent across each McAlister's.  The sweet tea here was refreshing & just the right amount of sweet.

Employees are quick & efficient with the ordering, & the bussing off of tables.

Prices could be better; they are pretty expensive. However, I do love their food, so I'll keep coming back, just maybe not as often."}
{"text":"This location is convenient to my work and home, so from time to time I stop in for lunch.  The service is usually pretty quick here. I like the selection here and the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"Updated to correct spelling errors/missed words....Quite good. While it doesn't make me feel like I am at Katz Deli In NY, its one of the best deli's in this neck of the woods. 

Very good quality meats, cheese and veggies, reasonably priced.

Some others in the area may be a bit cheaper but they simply are not as good. Id much prefer pay an extra $2 and get a sandwich with 2 or with some sandwiches even 3 times the meat, that leaves me stuffed and highly satisfied then to pay $2 less and still be hungry and not as satisfied with the quality as well.........(I did see the review from somebody that said something about they skimp on the amount of meat they put on a sandwich- I couldn't disagree more- and again, as mentioned below, while this isn't Katz Deli in NY, the quality is great and I've never once gotten a sandwich in which I felt there wasnt enough meat on it. For instance, the New Yorker- That is a quite meaty/thick sandwich. I also like Picadelis and several others in this area and with most I always have to order the 'double meat' to be fully satisfied and even with the 'double meat option' at any similar deli's around here, McAlisters regular still has more meat then similar deli's where I order double meat)

Couple of my favorites are the New Yorker and the Reuben. Others are also very good, but those are my 2 Fav's. The New Yorker is terrific. And very filling. Ive gone to other deli's in the area, which I thoroughly enjoy. For instance, Picadelis (sp?) is close by and I like it. But at picadelis, you can get the same 'new yorker' or 'reuben', and then pay extra for double meat, and while good and no complaints, even with the double meat it pales in comparison to McAlisters regular new yorker/reuben etc etc etc.....

Very good, imo. Cant attest to other locations as this is the only one I go to, but once or twice a week at this location for quite awhile now has yet to leave me disappointed A single time. 

The loaded spuds are good as well. A tad pricey, but then again they are quite big and they sure do load on the toppings and can be fully customized to your liking.

Happy eating.."}
{"text":"Horrible service for over priced food. Tonight was a joke. My father never got his food, and asked for his money back; the guy couldn't have cared less and never offered an apology or tried to make it right. We sat at our table and watched the staff walk around aimlessly while food sat on the ledge ready for serving for far too long. My 'iced tea' was hot, and they wouldn't give me a re-fill. 

I'll never go back, and would never recommend to anyone I know."}
{"text":"In this deli...it is not the meat that will win you over..so choose wisely. Any chain that serves Butterball turkey in all sandwiches clearly has their eyes on the budget and big picture because that brand is worse than Boars Head which is my low end turkey cutoff point. I steered clear of all turkey and ended up with a sandwich on ciabatta that just included chicken strips, sharp cheddar cheese and the star of the meal - peach chipotle sauce. It was that sauce that gave me the sweet and a bit of spice and really took those basic ingredients to the next level. If you check-in, you will receive a free cookie and it was a serviceable version of the choc. chip variety. None of the sides are homemade, so I was forced to go with a bag of Doritos as my side dish. Shout out to the staff though as they quickly turned the Dbacks game on their lone TV and they were friendly too. It's two stars, but I would go back and get that lone sandwich again if necessary. Drink machine does not to be behind counter either, that ended about 15 years ago."}
{"text":"Dirty, rude and lukewarm food.

We went to grab dinner on a Thursday night at this location. We arrived at 8:00PM (two hours before the closing time) and walked into an empty restaurant with several dirty tables and a filthy floor.

The employee at the register, who also appeared to be the manager, seemed extremely burdened to take our order or even acknowledge us. 

Once we found a (semi) clean table, our food arrived lukewarm. Not to mention, my side of fruit looked like it had been sitting out for a week.

Overall, very disappointed in this location. We've always enjoyed McAllister's food, but we will never return to this location. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I agree with Brett, for consistency, this McAlisters has it.
I used to always go to this one, prior to Mooresville getting theirs.

My regular meal of the BLT, potato salad & sweet tea is consistently good. Perfect amount of the bacon, lettuce, mayo & tomato makes for a perfect BLT.

Staff are friendly & quick & the resturaunt is always clean."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times & consistently, \"I've experienced better\", more specifically at other McAlister's locations.

For the consistency part: the food is always the same...I always get a BLT, potato salad, & sweet tea, & every time they taste the same. The BLT isn't great, the bacon is a bit overcooked & the bread isn't necessarily fresh. The potato salad doesn't taste fresh. Yesterday's visit: the sweet tea tasted a bit bitter.

The staff is consistent, as well. They're not overly friendly or attentive. Yesterday, we encountered an employee who didn't seem to care that he was there.  Unfortunately, he mumbled too, so we had a hard time understanding him. Somehow there was a mixup with the register & order, & a manager publicly reprimanded him in front of all us customers. I felt very embarrassed for him & ashamed at the manager for using such poor judgement in scolding him in front of customers. 

The restaurant is clean & there's a good deal of parking. They also have free wi-fi & patio seating. Prices are a bit much for what you get, but food costs are rising everywhere.

As convenient as this location is, (right beside Concord Mills), I think yesterday's visit made it my last."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, customer service was great, and very clean. The food never disappoints and the Tea was great as usual. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food presentation was not very good. My plate had honey mustard all on one side and some of the fruit fell out the bowl."}
{"text":"You owe it to yourself to compare Jason's Deli with McAlister's. 

Both serve Deli sandwiches, spuds, sides, drinks, & sweets. However, Jason's sandwiches are big, overflowing with the best of what you order. No chips in a bag either. Handfuls of chips on your plate or whatever side you order. Just like a real deli. There's NO SALAD BAR at McAlister's? Jason's has an all you can eat organic salad bar or just a single trip to the salad bar. You get and refill your own beverages at Jason's. McAlister's, you hope someone will get you a refill. Did I mention the desserts, or the serve yourself ice cream machine at Jason's? C'mon people. I have no stock or franchise in either, but there is loads of more value and qualitative differences at Jason's Deli. You don't get weighed portions. You get generous portions of handmade goodness. Again, self-serve FREE ICE CREAM! Jason's is in Pineville and across from Park Road Shopping Center. Much better food and value at Jason's! And....I asked for extra mayo at McAlister's and they gave me packets of \"light\" mayo? Yeah. I need extra mayo so I can lighten up on my mayo intake."}
{"text":"I'd like to update my last review. The GM, Kody, is a class act. He reached out to me right away and has used this situation as a training tool.  I hope to see continued improvement in the future. Thanks, Kody!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! I ordered the Southwest Salad and Broccoli and Cheese Soup. Everything was served quickly and super friendly."}
{"text":"No way will I return here. Underwhelmed right from the start. Mumbling order taker that sounded like she needed to take a nap. 
My wife order her sandwich with no tomato, but it had tomato on it. I had salad with chicken, but there was only 3 slivers of chicken. The food was bland.  The only reason for the 2nd star was because the place was clean. I give this place 6 months before it closes. It's more like a sandwich shop than a deli."}
{"text":"I have given McAllister's way too many chances. I normally order takeout on the phone. McAlister's has a call center that takes orders. I do appreciate that they can pull up past orders via phone number, however they OFTEN forget to push SEND to send order to restaurant. I have shown up to McAlister's on more than 5 occasions and they have no order for me. The last tome it happened I had it and asked to speak to a manager. The cashier went and told him and I watched him continue his conversation with an employee laughing for another couple of min. Finally he came over. I explained my situation and he brushed it off saying oh that happens all the time they don't push send on the orders he then took my order and pointed for me to sit down. It's a shame bc I do like the food, but not enough to go through that madness anymore"}
{"text":"This place gets 3.5 stars from me.
So I went to McAlister's Deli pretty excited because the word deli was involved... well... I would hardly call it a deli. Deli's are so much more than just a place that has sandwiches!
I ended up ordering the baked potato with veggie chili and some pepperjack cheese with jalapenos on top. It must have been two baked potatoes opened up because this thing took up the whole to go box that it was in. I must say, it was pretty good... nothing I couldn't make at home but hey.. we all get lazy sometimes.
At first I was thinking...wow... that's a lot for a baked potato... but this thing was so huge that it was totally worth it. I would suggest this place... but if you're expecting some amazing pastrami sandwich with the most delicious pickles ever... you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"A couple days ago, I was contacted by the new manager at this location. Apologizing for my poor experience on 7/15 and promising it's getting better. I went there yesterday to see if this was true. I was very happy to see that it was. Whatever the management is doing here, it's working. 

We were greeted and orders were taken in a reasonable time. Got BOTH drinks with our order before going to our table and the food arrived within minutes. The food was great, as usual. The mac and cheese was still brought to us in a \"to go\" container... we asked one of the girls why they're using that instead of an actual bowl... she said she was unsure but she hasn't seen them using bowls in a long time. Okay..... that was my only complaint but that's just me being picky. :) 

We were approached several times during our meal asking about refills..how our food was... and if we needed to go boxes. THANK YOU! Everyone was really nice and I appreciated the great service that we were given. 
We had a great time and we will be back. 
Well worth the money and the second chance. 

I hope the great customer service stays. :)"}
{"text":"McAlisters deli is, overall, a decent restaurant. It has a pretty diverse menu and has some real quality food. Speaking from experience, the salads and panini's are very delectable.

Decent for lunch trips. I limit myself as I wouldn't frequent the establishment for dinner. My opinion is such that it doesn't have the dinner atmosphere. 

The atmosphere, particularly at this location, is of a casual sandwhich-shop type and has a good amount of space so that even on a busy lunch hour there is always adequate seating, both indoor and outdoor. Service is generally quick, again, even with a crowd. 

I have no complaints about Mcalisters other than it feels a bit overpriced. As casual as the business is, its my opinion that spending over $10 for a lunch can be better spent elsewhere- i.e. another sit-down restaurant with tip included. Unfortunately, I am also a picky eater when it comes to quality vs. cost, so for the money, it usually has to be justified."}
{"text":"Got the southwest chicken sandwich and coleslaw. Once I got home and opened up the coleslaw, it smelled up my entire living room. Due to my ability to eat just about anything I thought I'd try it. I had to toss it out as it was unedible..... without a doubt"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for lunch under $10.  Love love love the sweet tea (and I'm a northerner).  Good sandwiches and great nachos.  Can't wait to try the giant spuds I've been hearing so many good things about.  Guess it's a good thing I don't like cole slaw. . ."}
{"text":"I live over an hour away from this location and even further from the other, so since I had to drive all the way up here for medical reasons, I figured I would use my gift card and get some food and tea from one of my favorite places. Well, when I went to pay, I handed my gift card to the cashier and she then pointed to a very tiny sign while telling me that their registers were not processing gift cards right now, but by the looks of the sign, it has been more than just today. There should be a way to accept them, possibly call in the purchase or something...I had to charge this meal to a credit card which was frustrating, what if I didn't have that ability? 
I have worked in fastish food before, they should have really had a better work around."}
{"text":"I used to eat McCallister's in New Mexico so I was excited that one opened in Tempe but the food was lacking. The Club sandwich barely had any bacon, more like a few bacon crumbs total much less one slice of bacon at all. The added avocado also still had a piece of outer shell on it. Very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, and sometimes even stop by for carry out. Hands down, is one of the best places for a quick lunch, light dinner around. The price is reasonable, the food decent, and the service usually adequate. I love the unsweetened berry flavored tea, and the wraps. By the way, I just found out today that they will make nearly any of their sandwiches as a wrap. Sit outside if the weather is permitting. The Baxter area is usually quiet, and pleasant."}
{"text":"My mom and I were here on a Sunday afternoon. Mom ordered the California Reuben and I had the Ole Spud. Both were very good and the atmosphere was very relaxed. The staff was awesome as always and checked on us often. We enjoyed our meal and will b e back soon."}
{"text":"McAlister's is a great place to go when you want a reuben or other deli sandwich. And of course, their tea is pretty good as well. Servers are attentive when they have time (i.e. non-lunch hour rush) and allways ask if you need anything."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location has such a low rating. I am pleased everytime I come here. The food is good, the servers are friendly and the restaurant is clean. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I seriously have never had a fruit cup that tasted as good as that fruit cup did. It was ridiculous how much I liked it. The sandwich was good too! I don't like sweet tea but I make an exception for McAlister's. The only reason McAlister's loses a star from me is that the service was super slow. The line to order took forever and it took kind of long to get my club sandwich out. 

But man, that fruit cup was good."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  I was visiting family over the hoildays and we stopped in one day for lunch.  5 of us total and the total cost was about $45.  I ordered the \"Half and Half\" essentially.  For the soup, I got chilli and salad as the other half.  Chilli came out hot and was a good size for being a bowl.  Salad was good too, had pecans, bleu cheese, good dressing and some onion on it.  The rest of the family ordered sandwhiches, which were good sizes for the price.  

Most of us got drinks (fountain or Ice Tea) and the drink sizes are pretty much one size and huge.  I wish we would have had the option of choosing drink sizes, because I didn't want as much as I had.  Nice little place to try if you get a chance as they have a lot to choose from"}
{"text":"Despite an empty restaurant, the employees somehow manage to take 30 min to make a simple sandwich. Service here moves at glacial speed. At least they made it right."}
{"text":"We just relocated to the area, and Siri sent me here for sandwiches on our first day. A great find! Leaps and bounds better than Panera Bread. The staff are SO friendly, the prices are comparable to other similar places. All fresh ingredients, and I like the multiple choice of sides. We liked it so much we went back again yesterday, and had a similar positive experience. I have a feeling we'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary restaurant, not my idea of a deli. All the meat is precut Hormel brand. I expect exceptional in house cooked and sliced meats and home made sides. Just another fast food place, nothing special !"}
{"text":"Didn't like this location very much.  I ordered a tuna salad on a croissant to go, they gave me a chicken 
salad croissant instead.  My dining partner's salad was wrong, too.  He wanted a macaroni salad, but got a mac & cheese, which he doesn't like.
  The person that took the order didn't repeat the order to clarify it, like they usually do, they repeat it 
twice, once when ordering, also when they give it to you.  The restaurant was uninviting, looked like a factory, with ceilings that have pipes exposed. 
   I got sick after eating the chicken salad, it must have been old, or sitting out too long.  Very dissatisfied, because the other McAllister deli I
go to frequently in Illinois is much better.
  A very unpleasant experience to get sick from the food, these places need to have more quality control."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and was surprised at the new decor!  The whole place got a face lift and was very inviting.  I especially liked the Champaign wall featuring the Virginia Theater in town.  It was a nice touch. Although the tea should have stayed out on the counter.  Having it away from the soda machine was just inconvenient for staff and customers alike.  I had to wait to order while a refill was given.  I ordered the half and half with broccoli cheddar soup and the new black cherry ham sandwich.  I also got a sweet tea which was of course delicious. The soup was good with cheddar cheese melty and amazing on top, but the sandwich was underwhelming.  The proportions seemed off with a lot of ham and very little onions and spinach.  The onions were soaked in cherry juice and provided a nice addition to the flavor profile when I got one in my bite, but it wasn't consistently in every mouthful.  I ended up pulling it apart and rearranging them to spread the joy.  I will say as I was nearing the end of my lunch the gal that took my order, Lakishma, stopped by my table and got me a refill.  That was very nice."}
{"text":"McAlister's has made several updates since my last review, and there's no longer any skimpiness with the meat on the combo sandwiches. That was one of my only minor complaints in a long list of positives! (Now if they would only bring back the pot roast sandwich!) Kudos to a great restaurant chain for paying attention to things like that. :-)"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty. My mother-in-law raves about this place. During my visit, I ordered a Cuban hot sandwich, which I believe isn't a regular menu item. It was tasty but nothing too special. The picture showed it piled with meat but I was underwhelmed when mine was prepared. My mother in law got a New York sandwich, I believe, and my husband got a Reuben. Those sandwiches came stuffed with meat, which made mine look even more paltry. Their key lime lemonade was really good and the Chocolate cake was delish! The cake was my favorite thing. They also have an outdoor patio in the back - nice a quiet on a good weather day. I'm open to stopping by during my next trip to Charlottr but I'll try something other than the Cuban."}
{"text":"Back in the day when I worked at Carolina Place Mall, McAlister's was my go-to lunch spot to avoid the fast food overload in the rest of the food court. 

On a normal day at the mall, there is plenty of seating (both indoors and outdoors). The only time I've ever had an issue is on...say...Black Friday, but even then the staff is great about maintaining a good flow. 

The menu is simple and delicious. Great soups. Great sandwiches. Great sides (with some healthy options, which is nice). They also have killer sweet tea that comes in a gigantic cup, and you can get free refills, which is super helpful if you work in the mall for long hours."}
{"text":"Food was great!! The chili was a bit salty, but it could be me. I'm not to tolerable to salty foods. The place was clean, staff was friendly and good simple food . Happy me!!!"}
{"text":"Completely and totally understaffed for a Sunday afternoon. The food was not cooked well, and it looked very thrown together. There was very little seating and the time from entry to order was 25 minutes and entry to food was 55 minutes.

Employees who were walking around looked miserable. We just felt bad for them. 

That being said they have amazing potato salad. Probably the last time we go for a long long time."}
{"text":"This place is TASTY! The food was fresh, the Tea was delicious and the staff was extremely attentive! I highly recommend you put McAlister's on your list of must-have's in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey melt on wheat.  A pretty straight forward sandwich.  The bread was just not good.  It had a rubbery texture which made it \"chewy\".  I've had two other coworkers who have bad experiences at the uptown location.

I've been to other locations and have never had a problem.  I wonder if something in the quality is not that the same in the uptown location."}
{"text":"I wanted badly to like this place - the servers are sweet and kind, plenty of seating but it's overpriced and just OK. I should have started with 'oh the smell of burnt toast in the evening...' as when we walked in, the place reaked of it, and we were told that they couldn't do anything about it??!...

I ordered a choose two, veggie soup and a southwest chicken. Soup was okay, nice heat but meh. Sandwich was a little more interesting but both the lovely (who ordered a club) and I thought that for over 25 bucks we weren't blown away, heck we weren't even like, that's a great sandwich for 25 bucks. It was just okay. Which means okay for some, probably not for us on an ongoing basis."}
{"text":"Great food, but I gave it a three because it is always cold.  Hard to relax and enjoy when you are shivering!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah I think I'm finally done with this location.   I've had big orders that have been totally messed up, I've had take out orders which have been completely wrong with things missing and extra charges for stuff I never ordered, I've been charged twice with them telling me the first swipe of my card didn't go through then 2 charges show up on my statements. And I guess this last time just really was the last straw...  I walked in and I cannot see the menu board behind the counter so I asked the clerk where the paper menus were and he said they were out....OK CLEARLY SOMEONE IS NOT DOING THEORY JOB ...you can't tell when your getting low on something that important and reorder them...so this kid tells me to have my daughter read the menu to me....EXCUSE ME? I brought her as an eating companion not a seeing eye dog because your establishment lacks the brains to do their job...then after I tell him I didn't bring her as a translator. ..he told me to look the menu up on my phone....if I wanted to look and order from my phone I would have ordered something from the comfort of my home, not wasted gas going to your establishment...I'll gladly spend the gas to visit another location if I care that much about having mcalisters"}
{"text":"My coworkers eat here A LOT. It's nice because it is one of the few places we can agree on. I think that is because the menu is really diverse and there are a lot of options. The service is great, some might say too great. Something funny that happens is that the staff will constantly ask if you need anything. It's kind of nice if you need a refill or something. They care a lot about making sure you enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"We did an online order for Friday, 10/6/17 to be picked up by 5:45 PM, well, my husband got home early so I called to see if I could get my order early (4:30ish), and they had absolutely no problem with that! The food was ready and waiting for us and as before the sandwiches were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Our salon eats here at lease once a week! Mostly for the tea, its amaaaaaazzing! Today I ordered so much food for my coworkers and myself that it was a lot to carry, Cody which I believe is the manager brought me a huge bag to carry all the food and helped me to my car! That's just service you don't get everywhere you go and its more appreciated than people think. We love McAlister's and will continue to be loyal patrons!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sandwich to get your nosh on, give McAlister's a try.

I like their \"Choose 2\" combo, because their Tortilla soup is tasty (you can get a salad and half sandwich if you prefer, but then you'd be wrong, because...the Tortilla soup)

Current fave for the half sammy is the Horseradish Roast Beef and Cheddar - the Four Cheese grilled cheese is another.  Give the Reuben a miss, and I didn't really dig the Ham and Cheese Toastie - the Dijonnaise was a bit overpowering.

The staff is very friendly, which makes it that much nicer to visit.

Nice place to grab lunch.

(Does anyone else get static-shock from the cup when you're drinking water there?  That's an oddity of McAlister's that makes me chuckle just about every time)."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  Tons of menu options and tons of room for 2 or families.  I need to try different options as I keep getting the grilled chicken wrap.  (will update this review later) The potato salad is awesome.  Very friendly staff.  I always ask for extra pickles.  Haha!  Definitely recommend McAlister's for lunch."}
{"text":"Tonight I  came here with my family. Theresa and Daquan helped us at the register and they were very patient and friendly. We got our food in a timely manner and it was all correct and hot. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give this spot another try after a manager contacted me and sent me a gift card asking me to give this spot another chance. 

Definitely a better experience. I wish they wore name tags cuz then I could praise people on here. 

The Black girl with the black and red hair was extremely friendly not just to me but to other customers I witnessed her taking their orders. She greeted me. Asked me how my day was going. Asked me how much ice I wanted in my drink. Got my drink right away after I ordered. Just overall pleasant. I don't require all that, but it's nice when people want to go the extra mile. She even greeted people she walked past. Just now she told me she would check on my order. Wasn't even waiting that long. STELLAR customer service. Not sure how the others are but she is the example others should follow. 

I've never received my food so fast. I know that also has to do with the kitchen. 

I'm glad this experience was better because I was seriously considering go elsewhere but I like to give second chances when I'm asked to."}
{"text":"Need a sandwich in a pinch?! McAlister's a sure lunchtime stop. I've reduced the amount of times I eat here because when I was first introduced to McAlister's in West Texas, I couldn't get enough. Now that I work practically next door to this location, I don't visit unless I have to...too much of a good thing syndrome. 

The sandwiches are really good, especially the turkey and cranberry. They offer a few options for a side item, besides the usual chips pairing. (e.g., cole slaw, potato salad). I like their veggie chili too. They have huge cups for delicious sweet tea or lemonade. However, the coffee isn't gourmet, so steer clear if you are a coffee connoisseur. Good brownies and large cookies!

The parking lot is typically full during lunch, but it's a large lot and has plenty of spaces. There's free wifi in case you need to work through lunch. 

There is a nice sized patio and plenty of seating indoors. The employees are always friendly and the service is fast."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this location was outstanding. I ordered the Mcalister grilled chicken club. Lots of bread,,, sliver of tomato and the chicken was thinly sliced not like the pic shows. I also requested the potato salad as my side. I really expected it to be home made and was very disappointed when I tasted it. Straight out of a can."}
{"text":"I love McAllister's. I love their chicken salad sandwich and their potato salad and of course their tea. I give this place a 2 star rating because they are severely understaffed 12:30 lunch rush only two people working the front including the food Runner doesn't make any sense. Management may not care about a two star rating so I'm not looking for anything to change but at least I think I should bring it to light. Usually I get great service everything is pretty easy streamline and very efficient. Today they got my order wrong but I am going to attach that to the fact that it looks like the restaurant was just overwhelmed."}
{"text":"They should consider asking for names so that they don't have to go around asking who ordered what."}
{"text":"Great service from the get go. The person who waited on us was very warm and friendly. She took our order in a timely fashion. She actually repeated our order back and asked if we needed a dessert or not. We filled our cups with tea and fresh lemons and waited for our food. The same counterperson was removing dish ware from another table when our food came out and made sure to stop by our table to see if we were happy with our food. We were!!
$29 for two salads, two sandwiches and two drinks might be pricey for those on a budget but the service was got was what left a great impression on us."}
{"text":"I felt like a salad, and that's rare. I got the special salad, with chicken, almonds, and Gorgonzola. The dressing was shallot something. It was dull, but I ate it. The tea is good, and that's what drew me in to try the place. I agree, the prices for what you got is high. I might try it again when I come back in the area, the baked potatoes looked good."}
{"text":"The spuds and sodas are wonderful! Their menu is fun. From soups to salads to huge Texas size spuds with yummy things inside this place rocks! Try a spud with bacon & cheese or veggies. I am in love with them both. This place was a must go to because we have these in my home town of Memphis Tenn and I needed a fix of a Tx spud!"}
{"text":"ABOUT TIME!!! This was my favorite place to eat when visiting friends in Mississippi. I've waited 14 years for this place to come to Arizona!!! LVE their soups and sandwiches! Very clean place with friendly staff. Especially Q!! She is our favorite and such a sweetheart!! People complain about it being expensive but their prices are on par with Panera Bread, Cafe Zupas, Flancer's, Kneaders, etc. and the food here is WAY BETTER!! If you want Village Inn prices and quality, eat at Village Inn. If you want fresh, mouth watering, high end quality, you're at the right place!"}
{"text":"We arrived at noon and were first in the line.  They are not busy. Three staff behind counter.  waited 10-15 minutes as first in line before ordering. The staff seems in a daze. Only one person in the kitchen. Been here 25 minutes and still no food."}
{"text":"I got really excited when I've heard they were opening a McAlister's near my  job. I love this place and the service is great! I can't even pick my favorite dish, everything is so fresh and so delicious that is hard to decide. Normally I order grilled chicken salad and their grilled chicken salad is one of the best grilled chicken salad that I ever had. I go there at least once a week. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some fresh, fast and good food."}
{"text":"I normally go to another location but since I switched jobs and this one is the closest to me I decided to give it a try.
The place was busy when I got there, I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no croutons and no cucumber and ranch for dressing. I also asked for a cup of water which I never got!
My salad took so long that seemed like I had ordered their whole menu. 
I got my order to go and for my surprise when I go back to work to eat it there are croutons in my salad and they gave me two containers with dressing that were half filled which means I ended up without dressing halfway to my salad. 
The parking situation is horrible! They barely have spots and when I went back to my car someone parked in front of me so I could not leave until I was able to find the owner of the other car which almost cost me going back late to work. 
McAlisters is one of my favorites spots for lunch but I will not be back to this location, I rather drive longer to the one on Berewick town center."}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed when I walked in. I went to the pick up side of the counter and waited... and waited... and waited. No one even acknowledged that I existed. The gentleman bagging order ignored me and the young lady taking orders ignored me. Finally I walked over to the other side of the counter and finally it was hey how are you. Uhm seriously?? I don't understand what the logic behind that was, and the restaurant was fairly empty as well so being busy isn't an excuse. I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for the fact the young woman ringing up customers redeemed herself. She took the time to check the order, and double check it and to ensure everything was in there and when it wasn't she made sure she got it. Again she initially ignored me haha but she definitely redeemed herself and she was very nice.

The food was fine. I was doing takeout so there's only so much they can do to keep things warm. I wish takeout boxes had air holes so the steam didn't collect in the lid making everything soggy (this is not specific to McAslisters just a general thought)."}
{"text":"To begin with... the cashier was nice! This is the reason why I give it one star. I am a loyal McAllister customer and our experience at this location was horrendous. My sister and my brothers girlfriend had potato spuds they were SO Dried the potato's crumbled. The potato's spud were super duper DRIED. The only thing fresh on my sisters veggie spud was the onions! Can you believe that? It hardly had any cheese and the spud was COLD. My personal experience with my potato soup and Mac and cheese were terrible! The Mac and cheese was cold and GROSS! and very dry and clumpy. I requested my soup with NO BACON! and guess what.. I got bacon.... the soup was the nastiest soup I've had in any McAllister in NC and SC. This place needs management to review there kitchen practices and food quality. Hopefully this review is helpful."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location. The girl taking my order was friendly and attentive. My order came out quickly (it was to-go). The cook got my order wrong, so I went back into the store and told someone. Not only did they fix it, they apologized three different times and gave me a free piece of cheesecake. That's customer service! I really liked their sweet tea, which is always a bonus! I'll definitely give this place a try again. Especially considering the fact that everyone messes up sometimes, but how you handle it determines how I feel about returning."}
{"text":"Solid, consistent. A step up from fast food. Employees always friendly and orders always correct. Potato salad and sweet tea both addictive. Convenient, easy place to eat."}
{"text":"For today's lunch, I decided I needed some soup and a sandwich.  And since there is some conspiracy for Panera's to have terrible parking and difficult busy-corner access, McAlister's was going to have to do the job.

While waiting in line behind the SouthPark ladies who were lunching, their preacher cut right in front of me (\"Ohhhh, there's my favorite preacher\").  I assumed once we got to order, being a gentleman and a man of God, he would tell me to go ahead and order since I had been standing behind the meemaws for about 7 minutes by then.  Wrong.  That is not what Jesus would have done.  Whatever.  They only had one person on the register for a bit, so the line took longer than usual.  I like that they have the Choose 2 where you can get a cup of soup and either half of a sandwich, half of a spud or a small salad, but I was hungry after having a small breakfast, so went with a full sandwich with a cup of soup.

The sandwich:  Chicken salad on a croissant.  Croissant was soft, chicken salad was very good, but sparse (chicken, mayo, nuts and I believe dried cranberries).  Was quite tasty, but needed more to fill the croissant.  Served with a pickle, which are typically good, but I was not feeling pickley today.  
The soup:  Broccoli cheddar.  Tasty.   Boiling hot, which is infinitely better than stone cold.  A soup spoon would have been nice rather than a regular spoon, but that is a matter of preference and not a requirement.  A thinner version than most of the broccoli cheese soups out there, but was still well flavored and hit the spot.
The beverage:  Half and half tea.  McAlister's has awesome tea, which I always get and usually get a refill on the way out, but the tea today was not good.  I barely drank half.  
Dessert:  No dessert because they had no cookies.  Seriously.  

There is parking directly in front of McAlister's, but it is typically full, so you're going to need to park farther out in the lot.  Pay attention when crossing the lot, as the driveway to enter is right where you are going to need to walk and folks come flying through there. Tuesday night (I think), kids eat free, so use that information as either a warning or a helpful hint."}
{"text":"I am not sure if it speaks to the location of the restaurant, or that I am absolutely oblivious to my surroundings, but I visited this shopping center no less than 10 times before I even noticed this McAlister's in the parking lot.  Close to a Teeter, CVS and Starbucks, this makes for a place to eat with slightly healthier options (if you choose) than the Hawthorne's and Lotus II that are in the area.

My first visit on a Kids Eat Free Tuesday (I had been at Salon 42 across the street for 2 hours and my stomach was eating through to my spine or I would have kept on moving when I saw that sign) was less than impressive.  My club had bacon pieces instead of strips and the bread was kind of stale.  But there was plenty of meat and the potato salad side was good.

My second visit for ultimate nachos was A-OK.  Chips were as good as bagged chips get, smothered with cheese and chili, it made for a decent snack before grocery shopping (don't grocery shop hangry!).

At the start of summer 2014, they had some new tea and lemonade concoctions.  I decided to try the strawberry lemonade - which is McAlister's lemonade with strawberry syrup and topped with fresh strawberries.  It was quite refreshing and good.  They also have a mixed berry and a watermelon lemonade.  I shall return to try those.  

The staff was pleasant on both of my visits (especially the second on 5/30, late afternoon, there was a brunette gentleman working that was a delight, in case anyone from McAlister's reads this).  Lots of choices ranging from healthy salads to baked potatoes with every protein and dairy product imaginable.  While McAlister's is never my first choice, this location is convenient to where I live and shop so I am sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"It was Lunch rush when we went there, however, our order came out really quick. We probably waited less than 5 minutes. I was little disappointed that i couldn't get refill offer. They looked busy so I just left."}
{"text":"Great food, even better price!!! I got the French Dip and it did not disappoint! Tender beef, good au jus. Just yum all the way around! My husband got the ham toastie and said it was great! We frequent Cafe Zupas and he said, it's much much better. we will now make the drive to come to McAllisters!"}
{"text":"We waited over 15 minutes to get our food! The place was almost empty. When I went to ask why it was taking so long they said it would be right out. The food then came out cold and not very good. The potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I decided to give Mcallisters another chance and this store was 100 times better than my last experience! The store was clean and even had a mural on the wall with local high schools which was a nice touch. I had a half club sandwich and half bacon spud. My mom had the Savannah chopped salad. The food was quick and the potato was hot! Much better experience."}
{"text":"The food is great and the employees are very helpful! I like that it has a more expanded menu and  zestier sandwiches than Panera Bread!"}
{"text":"First time here ! good service, and fast too. Food is good , lemonade is awesome . I had the pink lemonade and the Sweet Chipotle chicken sandwich !  Definitely recommend this place.. Wish they had them in California ! Keep up the good work! If I could suggest anything it would be to clean up tables a little quicker.. people finish eating and leave the plates and stuff on the table and since the staff is busy the tables just sit there with dirty dishes etc... maybe more staff is needed ? other than that awesome food !!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointing!  I've come here many times and have loved it!!  However, the last two times my order was not what I asked for.  Tonight Jackie took our order and I specifically asked to make sure that the bread was well toasted on my sandwich.  Well, for the second time that did not happen.  Also the two other people that ordered with me received their soup in bread bowls.  We did not ask for bread bowls.  Sad!  I really really enjoy the food when they make it correctly.  Customer service had never been great, but because the food was good, I was willing to over look that.

I don't plan on returning!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience- borderline racist. Wow. I waited in line for 10 min while there was ONE person in front of me. And when it was my turn, they didn't even acknowledge me and took someone else's question who walked up blatantly after me. I thought the south was supposed to be friendly. There were so many people at the counter not doing anything. That's the most unprofessional service I've ever received. AVOID."}
{"text":"Ok it's McAlisters, they've just opened up a couple of weeks ago. I came in with my son and was greeted by everyone. Friendly staff. The lemonade was yummy. I ordered a Ruben which is usually my go to sandwich at places like this..however it was made all the way wrong  To me this is such a simple sandwich, so how one doesn't put cheese or thousand island dressing on is beyond me. I just know now that I need to check my food before I walk out the door from now on. They have baked potatoes and soup on the menu, and I am looking forward to trying other things."}
{"text":"This McAlister's at the Arboretum seems to be a bit smaller than most (more narrow).  I stop by every month or so to take lunch to my folks house.  My typical order includes the New Yorker (Corned beef, pastrami, Swiss and spicy brown mustard on toasted rye) with a side of their potato salad - I love their potato salad.  The sandwich is good with well flavored, tender deli meat.  I also usually get a nacho basket for us to munch on too which is Ro-tel cheese dip and tortillas (hold the jalapenos, please).  The dip tastes like it comes out of a jar and the tortillas taste like they come out of a bag, but this is a sammich shop, not a mexican restaurant, so I don't expect perfection.  It's tasty and the dip is always nice and hot (hot temperature wise, it's a medium heat for spice).  

And their sweet tea is YUM!  I order half and half so I am not drinking a gallon of sugar, but it is SO good.  

I usually go prior to 11:30 on a weekend, so there isn't a crowd.  The employees are friendly and the to-go order is usually in my hands within minutes."}
{"text":"Ok McAlister's, you get your 5 stars for service.  Everyone there is overly friendly and helpful.  You also get 5 stars for the amount of staff you have on hand, the speed of service, and the cleanliness of the place.  I also enjoy the ginormous drinks that are refilled for you without you having to get up.

What I don't like is the menu.  There are just too many choices.  Also, it is a mish mash of stuff that is difficult to wrap my head around.  Looks like their thing is sweet tea, baked potatoes, salads, and deli sandwiches.  The place kinda sorta looks like a sports bar so it is all a very strange combination to me.

I've been there twice so far and have thoroughly enjoyed my salad and sandwich each time.  The ingredients look to be fresh and the portions are good."}
{"text":"Very slow service we came in at 5:30 and it is 5:45 still waiting in our food. Gonna be late for our appointment for sure."}
{"text":"This is my usual Mcallister's. The staff is always wonderful, the food is cooked quickly and when I dine in the service is always great."}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit to McAlister's in Tempe on 1/27/2018.  We ordered food to go for the ASU basketball game.  We were greeted by a very pleasant girl at the register who helped us make a choice on a sandwich and side dishes.  We ordered 1 club sandwich (to share)with cranberry sauce, 2 drinks, 2 sides (potato salad and coleslaw) and a rice crispy bar.  We paid at the register and thought our order was pretty expensive - over $25.  The wait time was appropriate - less than 5 minutes.  The clerk delivered our bagged order to us and we proceeded to the basketball arena.  We opened our bag to discover 2 club sandwiches, which explains the $25 cost - we only ordered 1 sandwich, 2 sides of coleslaw - no potato salad was included and no rice crispy bar. Unfortunately there was no time for us to return to the deli to alert them of their mistake.  Service was nice and prompt, but they really need to work on double checking their orders.  I will say that the sandwich was terrific and very large.  We feel like we were cheated out of our order.  This would have been a 5* review if the clerk had correctly processed our order.  Perhaps she was new???"}
{"text":"I just visted the McAllister on Catawba Ave, Cornelius...i am so disappointed...I ordered the California Ruben...with a side of potato salad...i was given a number to sit and the cashier said someone would bring my food...she started to make my drink when another customer came up...lifted her bread and showed the cashier...i ordered this Ruben without slaw....no issue...as I was handed my drink I went to walk to get me a seat and the food expo lady came to me and said, I have your food...i looked and they handed me the food that this other customer had her hands all over...i said no way I'm not eating what someone else ordered and even touched...i know this because 5 other people ordered in front of me...and my food is being placed before I can even get 5 steps to a seat....the mgr lady  came back with the plate again and asked me what was wrong...i explained ..she said oh sorry I'll be back...came back with that same damn sandwich only this time they had toasted it in a toaster...bread was burnt...i ran a resteraunt for 6 years and I know what reheated cheese looks like....i got a refund and I will never eat there again and my friends will hear about it too.....#justnasty"}
{"text":"We love eating here the quality and variety is fantastic! The Mcallister club is my favorite!"}
{"text":"food way over priced!!!
definitely not worth it. pictures all over are a misrepresentation of what you actually get!! very disappointed. the next time i want a sandwich i will go get stuff from the store.
wish jason's deli was still open!!
will definitely not be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Food is amazing and I'm obsessed with their teas. All the employees are very friendly and make sure your drink is filled at all times. I try and come here once a week!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was thoroughly impressed.  Lots of good options on the menu for everyone to choose from.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"OK...portions, variety and service.  This is an order at the counter and take a seat with a number to have your order delivered.  Salads are good sized and the drinks, at least our iced tea, came in huge glasses.

Great for lunch, is crowded but moves fast.  Could be in the food court, but has an outside entrance.

Just OK."}
{"text":"A lovely place for a casual lunch. The staff is friendly and helpful. The Autumn squash soup is delicious. Paired it with a ham and Swiss sandwich, which would have tasted better without the mustard. 

Hubby had a roast beef sandwich, which was OK."}
{"text":"McAlister's is a respectable quick service chain restaurant.  The sweet tea is among the best I have had.  Most of the menu is at least somewhat healthy.  I love the Savannah Chopped Chicken Salad and the dressing that accompanies it.  Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but tonight, everything was wrong, and I'm not exaggerating. They got the order wrong, and although they apologized and corrected it that was it. Then- no water. No au jus got the steak potato. Cucumbers on the salad- the only special request I'd made. No one came by to check on me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The southwest chicken salad is amazing. The half muffalata and cup of gumbo is also really good. The staff at this location is very friendly and accommodating. While it is a self service restaurant, the staff constantly walks around to see if you need drink refills or if there is anything they can get you. Its good food at a great price and has become a regular weekend lunch spot for me. The tea is also really good if you like tea. Coupons are regularly available for 3.00 off an entree from money mailer so make sure to look for one before going, but if you find it online it must be printed."}
{"text":"This location was horrible. How are you short staffed on a Saturday? When we received our food it was cold and barely seemed as if the portions were correct. I had the black angus roast beef spud and it was the driest coldest potato I've ever had. It was as if they over cooked the potatoes and then threw meat and cheese on it and let it sit in the back for about 10-15 mins. My moms bacon spud barely had any bacon or cheese for that to be the main thing on it. She addressed it with the staff and no one cared or tried to fix it. They basically brushed it off as oh well we are not fixing it, it is your problem now. This place is a disgrace compared to the other McAllister's I've been to. I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"You are on Cox rd when you go to this place. You will pay too much and receive too little.
I actually had to ask for the rest of my side dish.....they use very small bowls to make the helping look big and then put too little on it so it really looks too small. I would speculate you are getting a heaping tablespoon of potato salad  and the price is flat stupid.
The sandwiches are actually good, but once again, they seem SOOO stingy with the meat. Most of the time I leave mad. 
I have stopped going here at all, I would rather stay on Cox and drive toward Ozark. Cross Ozark going into Ranlo about 3 blocks up on the right is a place called Will's Doggin it deli. You can get 2 times the meat, actual fresh fixings and 3 times the amount of pasta or potato salad for the same money. I'm not kidding, If Will moved to the store beside this 
McAlister's Deli , they would go out of biz in a week and their help would be eating at Will's that week for lunch.....
I am not affiliated with Will, I am however not going to hide the facts from you. You deserve BOARS head meat, FRESH tomato and lettuce and more BANG for your BUCK. SUPPORT LOCAL!"}
{"text":"A great McAlister's location. Huge vaulted ceilings, nice outdoor seating, and solid food. My personal favorites are the Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller (chicken, cheese, guacamole, and a spicy sauce, grilled panini-style on ciabatta) and the salads. Staff has always been very nice and helpful, including bringing food to the table and grabbing napkins, refills, etc. I would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch!!

Green tea is amazing (yes, it's sweetened with Splenda)!

Their menu is a bit large, but when you find your lunch combo you will not deviate!  I love the strawberry salad and grilled chicken on wheat.  Their chicken tortilla soup is awesome too.

Ordering is ordinary, but the wait staff is attentive and the food comes out pretty fast.

Love that they play all the current sports on the tele's!  Go Pats!"}
{"text":"As good as some of the McAllister's I have visited have been, this one comes in towards the bottom, especially compared to the one at Lake Norman.

My sister used to live across the street, so I have been here a couple of times, the first after we finished moving her in.

I was famished and excited there was a McAllister's across the street. I needed a sammich, cookie and sweet tea immediately!

The place was deserted when we walked in, and the service, while fairly quick, was less than enthusiastic. It almost seemed like we were bothering them, even though it wasn't even close to closing time.

My sandwich was okay, but sloppily made, and even though they were supposed to have broccoli and cheddar soup that day, they had run out.

Since every place can have an off-day, I went back once more, and had a pretty similar experience. 

The tea was still good though, so that's something."}
{"text":"Although McAllister's locations seem to be a bit inconsistent, the one in Cornelius is definitely one of the better ones.

For starters, it is in a really cool building, almost ski lodge-esque on the interior, with exposed beams and the roof rising to an A-point.

The walls are decorated with local sports jerseys and posters, giving it a decidedly hometown feel.

The outdoor patio area has plenty of tables and can be a good place to relax and traffic watch.

The food is also good at this location. Turkey and swiss on croissant is my general meal of choice, and when its available, I also get the excellent broccoli and cheese soup.

Parking can be a bit of a problem, with the lot outside serving a row of businesses, which is why I'm giving this location only 4 stars.

Very popular spot for lunch, but the service inside keeps things moving along, so the wait never seems too bad.

And, of course, McAllister's has some of the best sweet tea around!"}
{"text":"I think we may have picked the wrong day or the wrong time of day to visit. It was like dining in a school lunchroom. Noisy, table was dirty when we sat down, and food, which was mediocre at best, was slow to come out. On the upside, the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better tea. If you like sweet tea or even unsweet you have to try their tea it is one of a kind. I have been going to this location since they opened and Sarah always takes amazing care of me and remembers me order. Also they have some of the best salads since I try to always go with a healthy lunch. Go check them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"On a cold afternoon, this is a perfect place to have a mid-day snack.  I've been several times and never had anything that didn't hit the spot.  It's clean, the staff is friendly and the menu includes several \"comfort food\" items.  Highly recommend it to all"}
{"text":"Bacon Turkey Bravo is my favorite!  Always really friendly staff and the tea is top notch"}
{"text":"Was excited to go back - last visit had a club sandwich.  Very good.  This time, however, two of us ordered - one the Horseradish Roast Beef & Cheddar - 
Black Angus roast beef with sharp cheddar, caramelized onions and horseradish sauce on ciabatta bread.  He shared half of his with me, and I shared half of my  California Turkey Reuben - smoked turkey, coleslaw, Swiss and Thousand Island dressing on toasted rye.  I had the better deal.  Not over the top in flavors - but a great taste - coleslaw was a little too sweet for me but not bad.  His, however, was \"ok\" - just lacked flavor.  Beef was bland, couldn't taste any horseradish or onions.  Oh well.  Previous visit and had the McCalister's club.  Very good.  I'll be back... but choose differently next time."}
{"text":"An Irish deli? Why not?  The pastrami on rye was worthy.  My wife did the choose two menu with a turkey sandwich and a veggie spud while I augmented my choice with a cup of veggie chili.  Everything was fresh, fast and tasty.  It took me 9 hours and 27 minutes to get to Monroe NC. I don't think I'll get a chance to come back but it was a good finish to a long day!"}
{"text":"Teenage girls working the front counter are not very nice or caring. I am diabetic, I ordered one Diet Coke and one regular coke for my son. She plops both down in front of me, can't remember which is diet, and laughs and says I think the one on the right. My right or yours I ask, she laughed and looked confused and acted like I was crazy. IT MATTERS TO A DIABETIC AIRHEAD!!!
Also their soups taste like they open a can of Campbell's soup. They could do better. Sandwiches are excellent which is why they get two stars."}
{"text":"Thought I would give them another shot after a few bad experiences years ago. I can't figure out why they are still in business! The prices are too damn high considering the quality and size of the food items with the exception of the 1 gallon cups they use. 

Tried a choose 2 with a bacon & cheese potato and a French Dip. I asked if the potato would melted shredded cheese or liquid cheese and she said liquid. It was definitely a very skimpy portion of melted and re-hardened shredded cheese. I included a photo of it for your opinion. Should've taken a photo  of the tiny sandwich too. It was about 4 inches and had a small pile of beef in the very center of the bread. I paid $7 for this sad little meal. Wendy's bacon & Cheese potato is the same size or larger with actual melted liquid cheese and twice as much bacon for $1.99. Throw in a Jr. cheeseburger and you would get a much better meal at half the price. 

Writing this place off for good now!"}
{"text":"We are transplants from Memphis and we were thrilled to see McAllisters come to town. Their tea alone is worth the 22 mile trip from our home, but their salads, sandwiches, and spuds are terrific! We have never had anything we didn't like and there aren't many places in Phoenix to get a good Muffaletta!"}
{"text":"We come here for lunch all the time and we love it! The iced tea is fresh brewed and I love the huge cups- great value. We use their punch cards and get free stuff all he time because we are here about once a week. My husband really likes the French dip with mashed potatoes, I usually get a French dip with veggies. Our daughter also enjoys the kids meal- it's a great deal and comes with Mac and cheese, teddy grahm crackers and apple sauce! If you use the check in feature on the yelp app they will give ou a free cookie!"}
{"text":"1st off it's pretty pricey for just a sandwich and a drink it was over $11. me and a coworker ordered at the same time and he added a soup and mac and cheese and i got my 1 sandwich 9 minutes after my coworker got his and all he had left was a half sub left. other than that my sub was pretty good. but i won't return because of the service."}
{"text":"I had the pick 2 with a yummy turkey ruben. I was suprised to find out you can get a smaller side salad of any salad on the menu with it. Sold me on this place. We all sampled each others food and everything was good. I also liked that they give you a huge drink for one price in a plastic cup so you can take it with you."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is pretty bad, but I guess what can you expect for the only place open for breakfast at 7:30am on a Sunday morning in Concourse C of Cleveland Airport?  

Lucky for me, my connecting flight to DC is not for a few hours because otherwise I wouldn't have had time to stand in the line that was 20 people deep when I showed up.  They were clearly understaffed because there was one person manning the cash register and one person in back frantically making the food, if you can call it that.  

I had a breakfast sandwich ($3.49) with sausage ($0.99) and a bottle of Orange Juice ($1.99) which came out to about $6.50.  The best part of my meal was the OJ, which is the Ocean Spray crap made from concentrate, so that should tell you something.  

The breakfast sandwich is described as \"egg and cheese on sliced wheat bread\" and it is exactly that.  Except the wheat bread was a really flimsy piece of sandwich bread which fell apart when you touched it.  It was a good thing that there was one little slice of melty American cheese keeping my sandwich together.  The egg was runny and dripped out the back of my sandwich when I took my first bite.  The sausage was super salty and small; most of my so-called sandwich was dry wheat bread with some eggified yuck cheese.  

In short, my sandwich was abysmal.  

But again, what can you expect for the only place open for breakfast at 7:30am on a Sunday morning in Concourse C of Cleveland Airport?  

If you're ever stuck here and you need food, I hope some other place may be open so you don't have to eat here."}
{"text":"The turkey on my sandwich was slimy turkey and the lettuce on my sandwich and lettuce was the outer layers of a head of lettuce that I would throw away, also the sandwich had a half slice of tomato for a whole sandwich. The place was clean and inexpensive, but I'd rather pay a few dollars more and get something I didn't throw in the garbage."}
{"text":"This location sucks , always get the order wrong, don't read special instructions . Will never go back to this location even though is 5 mins from home . Going to Matthews now, their service is awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and the service is even better! Reasonable prices and the cookies are yummy! Love their tea, too! So glad it opened in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high. I was glad to see McAlisters was moving into this space. I work close by & wanted a reliable variety. I have now tried soups, sandwiches, & Salad. None were bad but none particularly good either."}
{"text":"This is long overdue! the manager contacted me after my last review and told me if I came in he would have two VIP cards put in the office for me. Well that was a year ago and I just made it in yesterday. The girl at the register said they would not be there still something had been so long, but the manager said he would still honor it! So nice of him! This time I ordered the southwest chicken salad and the Southwest Turkey melt. I loved the sandwich. It was on French bread that was not too hard to eat and it had lots of bacon on it. The turkey was really flavorful also! The salad was pretty good, but I probably would rather just have the sandwich. The salad was really fresh and had turkey, corn, guacamole, tortilla chips, and a creamy Southwest chipotle dressing. Overall, I really like this place for their sandwiches and will probably come back for those!"}
{"text":"Well, well, well! Yes- I've had a change of heart about McAlister's and I will be all to happy to tell you how I went from 2 stars to 5 stars!

I heard from Kody, this location's GM, who expressed his concern that we weren't happy with our first visit. He offered me two vouchers to come in and try them again, and made some menu suggestions as well. Sooo... about a month after receiving these my husband and I decided to try lunch at the same McAlister's.

As before, it was busy at lunch, but the staff was unfailingly polite. We ordered, selecting a French Dip and a Savannah Chopped Salad. We had iced tea and 2 cookies as well, all part of our free meal (thanks, Kody!).  OK, the salad was mine but my husband actually thought he should have half of it. Nope- that was a great salad and I did not want to share. While he munched on my salad, I stole some of his French Dip, was was excellent as well.  Somehow I only got half a cookie.  So, this visit was a great success and we agreed to come back again, and stick to the popular items on the menu and Kody's recommendations.

Since that visit, I/we have been back at least SIX times (that's about every other week), usually take-out ordered online. The Savannah Chopped Salad is a favorite in our house- if things are busy I will order a couple and leave them in the fridge and they will be gone in 12 hours or less. 

What's on this awesome salad:  Crisped Greens, Dried Cranberries, Honey Roasted Almonds, Gorgonzola Cheese, Fresh Tomatoes, Cucumbers and Grilled Chicken. The Sherry Vinaigrette is the best dressing paired with this. This salad is appropriate to bring to an event if you get too busy to make your own dish- just pick up a couple of them and you'll be the hero!

My mother has been with me on a couple of these take-out runs, and gets a cup of soup. She has commented that she loves their soups, a high compliment coming from a food particular woman who was/is an excellent cook.

Iced tea is fresh! Cookies taste like homemade! 

I suggest that you try them out if you have not done so already. Ask what's popular and/or what the staff person's favorite items are if you are undecided, as the menu is large. And let them know if you don't like something- they will make it right."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to have lunch. Great prices and a warm atmosphere. The employees are always very nice and welcoming. I am obsessed with the potato salad. I would say that it is some of the best in town."}
{"text":"Love this place. Knew about it from visits to Missouri. I go about once a week. Best New Yorker sandwich and the best potato salad!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great food. I got the Chipotle Chicken Sandwhich. The food arrived in less than 5 minutes and the staff checked on my drink three times during the 20 minutes I was in there."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular family favorite because they have delicious sandwiches and tea! It is very clean and the staff is nice and eager to help with refills and checking up on us when dining (for the most part - see below). The stamp cards for their meals and a separate one for tea is a big plus. I like restaurants with rewards. I would give it 5 stars, but during that huge, flash flood storm that took the power out all over the city on September 27, 2014, I ordered take out online for the 1st time there. When I went to pick it up the guy wouldn't say a word to me - most unfriendly staff person I've ever seen there. I was trying to make small talk and all he would respond with was grunts. I overheard someone wish him a happy birthday. I wished him one too. I might as well have been talking to a wall - a very grumpy one. Maybe he was bitter about having to work on his birthday, but I used to wait tables and no matter what is going on in my personal life, there was never a reason not to treat my customers with kindness and good service.  He also didn't stamp my card for the three meals purchased. That was a bummer of an experience (some people don't belong in the hospitality industry), but otherwise we really enjoy this place. My only other gripe is that they got rid of the delicious multi-grain bread on my family's favorite cranberry orange turkey sandwich. We change the bread now, but nothing makes that sandwich as good as that dense, flavorful multi-grain."}
{"text":"I wish there was one in the East Valley.  I love the variety offered at this deli, but I went intentionally for their \"Big Nasty\".  The open faced hot roast beef is delicious, and a real taste of home.  Their menu has a lot of variety and large portions.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I ate here once and once was enough. It's an insult to even call this place a deli. I didn't even see typical \"deli\" food on the menu! My soup was bland and very overpriced. The only good thing I can say was that the guy working there was friendly."}
{"text":"Had the Black Angus Club and was happy with my choice. The food was good and the sweet tea is as good as any I've had. I only had a couple of negatives I felt I should bring up. 

1. The cashier reminded me of Aubrey Plaza's character, April, in Parks and Rec.

2. It took my coworker 15 minutes to get his lunch after they forgot his order. They quickly fixed the problem and offered him a free cookie to make things right. 

I would definitely go back. I won't call it a must go but if you're looking for a solid sandwich and one is nearby check it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I always love this place, McAlisters . I was disappointed this time with my sandwich that I complained and made it the correct way. It is a different restaurant location"}
{"text":"Didn't even notice the renovations they disclaimed were happening. The staff was so polite and the quality of food was out of this world. We've eaten at McAlisters before, but the service was 5 STAR quality,  and the taste of the Chipotle Chicken Panini, Mac N Cheese, and Club Sandwich were OUT OF BOUNDS!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that this location who sell \"Choose 2\" entrees are still good and yummy.  The portion sizes are amazing!  They are so much better than the surrounding local restaurants nearby.  The quality is delicious, there is never old food and they are not greedy.  The service is awesome, the employees come around to see if you need a refill or a takeout container.  They even just stop by to say hello, I love that.  Management has highly trained these employees to be the best.  Keep it up people!"}
{"text":"First time here and what a nice surprise. Lots of parking in this shopping center which makes lunch time get always from campus (ASU) easy. Parking can be difficult during the school year in the area so this is always a consideration for me. 

The line to order was not too bad at about 12:20. The menu is extensive.  I didn't dawdle since I was hungry. I ordered the grilled chicken salad with Italian dressing and an ice tea. I learned that their sweet tea is their point of pride. I just had the unsweetened variety. 

Our order came out in less than 10 minutes. This is a large salad folks. So huge that I didn't finish it. It was full of tasty, crunchy croutons on top. There were at least 2 strips of bacon, cheese, cucumbers and perfectly cooked chicken. I have to say this is the freshest salad I've had a restaurant in ages. I mean really fresh. There was both spinach and romaine lettuce in the mix. So danged good. The ice tea was perfect too and it came in a very large to go cup. All that being said, I think my lunch was pretty healthy! 

I will definitely be back and bring the work group. They deserve a great lunch too!"}
{"text":"This was the second bad experience I've had here & they simply don't seem to care about the fact that they have terrible service. The girl taking orders had sunglasses on inside with her friends hanging it at the counter, she charged us for an extra item that she then gave to her friend in front of us, and her manager sat on her phone in the corner oblivious to all of these things."}
{"text":"So this was my first time ever at a McAlister's Deli so I decided to go with a salad sandwich combo.  I ordered a Taco Salad and half ruben sandwich.  Well, Let me just say, I was not impressed at all.  The Ruben was warm, but not toasted, it had good flavor, but Subway does better.  So then we get to the Taco Salad,  now it was ok, I expected it to have warm taco meat on it, but it was COLD. the menu description, was far from what it turned out to be, i expected more of a taco salad appearance, and got a salad, with cold taco meat on it.  Certainly was not impressed. I would say that if you are looking for a true deli style meal, McAlisters is not the place, it is a typical cold sandwich place.."}
{"text":"I don't know how to give a low rating at this location, friendly staff. Food is the same anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm only going to give this place three stars because, honestly I don't eat here anymore.  I'm strictly obsessed with their AMAZING TEA!!!!

I stopped eating their food when I had a few awful experiences at the Carolina Place location, but that hasn't stopped me from loving their tea.

The parking is limited given the gym and other shops, but the people behind the counter are very friendly and nice to chat with about anything while I'm waiting for my beverage.

I don't like their lack of vegetarian sandwich options, it seems like no matter how you expand your menu, you should think of the few of us who don't eat red meat/poultry and just want a great vegetable sandwich with a fancy spread on a yummy roll.  But oh well, maybe one day I'll find that perfect sandwich..."}
{"text":"Nice deli with a lot of options.  

Food is great.  Recommend trying some of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"first time here a week ago was craving a good sandwich. I got the McAlister's club very yummy had my little bun in the oven dancing! enjoyed better than paradise bakery hands down.."}
{"text":"Love Mcalister's and was so excited to see one pop up in Cleveland area!  It's a similar scale to Panera, but with more homestyle and comfort food options.  You can get sandwiches and salads, but you can also get mashed potatoes, french dip, and other homestyle favorites.  Their spuds are delicious, as is their sweet tea."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my negative review because this place has really turned around. The service is always great and the food is really good too. We have visited this location many times since our 1 bad experience and have no complaints. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I moved here a few years ago, and the one thing I was really missing was McAlisters.  Best sweet tea ever, love their bacon and cheese spud and choices of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches & great service. Friendly & welcoming environment. Great variety of sandwich choices made to your taste and liking"}
{"text":"Fast and very friendly service. What more can you ask for. Oh yes, the food.  Famous ice tea is good. I had the Rubin and potato salad. Let's start with the potato salad. It was on the gummy side which leads me to believe it was also on the older side of it's life. The Rubin. So not expect New York here. It did have lots of corned beef but it was grocery store quality. Lightly toasted bread,not grilled. Little sauerkraut and the Russian dressing was not tasted. This was first visit to this location and I know they can do much better then this. They we're not busy at all, it was 2:30. So I'm never t sure the problem was."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews were so so.  I've been to Mcalisters in other Ohio cities and always enjoyed my food.  I find that it's a much better version of Panera. They even have a pick 2 option. I enjoyed my taco chili soup and veggie club. Veggies were fresh.  Portions were more than enough. They were very easy going considering I had an energetic toddler with me.  In today's world where fast casual is everywhere, I'm glad to have McAlisters as an option because it's not too unhealthy and has a variety of options."}
{"text":"I used to love their chicken cesar salad until I found a dead fly in one. I will not be eating there again"}
{"text":"I live near a McAlister's Deli and once recall eating a good sandwich there.  I haven't been there since since there are so many good sandwich places around.  And then something happened...a new McAlister's Deli opened up right near my office in Tempe.  It caught my attention!  From the creative promotions to the deli's involvement in the local community to finally the amazing service and of course, acknowledging the good food and what makes it unique.  Now, I'm sold!  I'll be a regular at both locations moving forward.  

Readers of this review are probably wondering what makes this deli so special.  In my opinion, it's the people and their connection to the community.  I've been to a few different Tempe and ASU events in the past few weeks, and each time, McAlister's Deli is represented by giving out free samples of their food or coupons or even just some smiles and hellos by their staff to community members.  But this is nothing compared to the excited college students working at this location along with their experienced managers.  Everyone is constantly checking in on you to make sure that you have everything you need while dining at their location and even if you are waiting for food, they are having conversations with you.  I visited the first week they were open, and while it took a few minutes longer than expected for food to be ready, I didn't even notice it due to the conversations I was having with the staff.  Even then, I was given a coupon for my next visit as the staff thought I was waiting for too long.  Definitely good customer service!  

The food and the atmosphere are great!  There is plenty of parking, plenty of seating, and enough space for the lines that they are bound to continue having in the future.  They have sandwiches, spuds (loaded potatoes with whatever you wish on them), salads, and soups.  I ordered a Choose Two, where I chose a half sandwich and a half salad (a New Yorker sandwich and a grilled chicken salad) plus one of their tasty cookies on the side.  All was delicious!  

Also worth noting is that this location hosts many fun contests relating to their location or even nearby ASU.  Follow them on Facebook, engage in their community, and win some gift cards and other prizes!  

Now I'm getting hungry...!"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened in their kitchen,but our food from McAlister's tonight was the worst. The spuds were sparsely filled with our selected toppings. Grilled cheese was hard as a rock,and tasteless. I could go on,but,enough said. Albeit it was a half hour from closing when we placed our order,but still,that is no excuse for poor food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday for lunch.  It was not busy, but the sandwich that came out(grilled chicken club) looked like it had been pre-made and sitting for hours.  The melted cheese was so hard you could tap it on the plate.  The grilled chicken was super dry too.  We sent the sandwich back to get another and while the second one was fresh, it was not even the same sandwich.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Turkey Ruben ....  Very good however the New Yorker sandwich would even make Ted Cruz a fan.    This was as good as a miracle mile sandwich.  We have been here two times and the service was great both times."}
{"text":"The Reuben sandwich here is amazing.  One star deducted for unimaginative Southwest Cobb salad."}
{"text":"My husband ate a lot of McAllister's while he was in college and so he was pleasantly surprised on a mini getaway weekend to Charlotte to find one in the vicinity of my best friend's house. On our way back home to Atlanta we decided to drop in and order some food. The restaurant was empty as it was memorial day but we got excellent service with a smile from the young man behind the counter. I ordered the club sandwich with the mac & cheese on the husband ordered a barbecue chicken sandwich with the potato salad. His sandwich was definitely tastier than mine but my mac & cheese won the side item wars. Super affordable at $13 for everything. Def recommend this spot."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, always see their ad on the bus stop when I drive by and I'm so glad I stopped in! The employees were great and the food was yummy. What made it a 5 star for me was the manager. When I was ordering he told me kids eat free Tuesday, and I should order something for my 2 year old. I got him the pita pizza and he seemed to like it pretty well. I tasted it and it was quite good. It was nice to see other options on the kids menu besides the traditional Mac n cheese or chicken strips... it came on a whole wheat pita too! The coleslaw was also good - not dry like a lot of places are making it now.

I will definitely be back to try a panini next time!"}
{"text":"My first time trying McAlister's Deli and I really liked what I had.  I tried the Choose 2 with the Garden Fresh Turkey and the Southwest Cobb Salad.  The sandwich had turkey, guacamole and spinach.  It was tasty and I liked the bread it was served on.  The salad had chicken, guacamole, corn relish, and tomatoes.  I liked the thinly sliced chicken breast in the salad.  It was tender, unlike a lot of chicken breast I've been getting in other restaurants lately.... 

The service was good and friendly.  I also enjoyed my unsweetened tea.  I do wish they had a bigger selection of chips or something other than Lay's potato chips.  I'll still be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food is tasteless and microwaved. I found a hair on my pickle! I would rather not eat than frequent this place again!! Absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"Horrific experience! Would give Zero stars if it was an option. Visited this location yesterday since kids eat free on Tuesdays. They were extremely busy and couldn't keep up. Tables were dirty. Bathrooms were filthy. The cashier \"Lauren\" (this was the name on my receipt, but couldn't confirm since no one was wearing a name tag) was extremely rude and unprofessional. Rolled her eyes at me several times when I asked questions about the menu. Didn't even tell me my total and threw the pen at me to sign the credit card receipt. Waited over 30 minutes for food and it came out cold. I asked to speak with the manager, but after 10 minute of waiting, I just left. I think she was too busy yelling and screaming at the cooks. I'm planning to take this complaint to corporate, but wanted to warn everyone on yelp first. Next time I want Mcallisters, I will be going to arboretum or Matthews, where I've always had a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I had a great experience. The staff were nice and the food was yummy. Checking in on yelp got me a free cookie too. A huge cookie!"}
{"text":"The people working were really nice and our food was good but could have been more evenly distributed, one side of the sandwich was really loaded with everything then the other side was just bread? But was still a good half sandwich."}
{"text":"Beware your car will be towed here.  The management here after eating did not defend us and stand up for our rights.  We often eat in this mall and we will no longer visit this area for lunch.  I'm really shocked that the management would not tell security and the towing company to bring my car back.  We never left the property and there is no map in the parking lot to identify what the property line is.  Seriously you very well could be towed eating here."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good chain deli. Sandwiches are good depending on what you get. I like the roast beef and cheddar and the Italian. Potato salad is very good as are the soups.
My only complaint is the price of the food. You pay for more than you get."}
{"text":"Loved it! I bought the roast beef and cheddar with caramelized onions it was fabulous! And the chop salad with their dressing. I was there for lunch and I wanted to go back for dinner it was so good! It's a must visit when you're looking for a good clean an expensive lunch and dinner too."}
{"text":"Awesome!! I came to visit Charlotte for the first time and stayed with a friend who lived across the street from McAlisters. I stayed in Charlotte for 5 days and went to this Deli 4 times. Haha

Huge menu, so many options and everything incredibly fresh. I've tried paninis and 3 types of salads. Large portions, decent prices, friendly staff, and plenty of healthy options. It is always packed during the lunchtime. If I lived around there, I'd quickly become a regular...I technically was one for 5 days. Great deli chain in NC!"}
{"text":"Went to McAlister's on Tuesday for lunch. We don't visit Tempe often and don't know the restaurants so we turned to Yelp. We had a great lunch, great service and will be back. It was obvious we were newbies and a manager/owner helped us.  Had both kinds of tea and both were good. The spuds were done perfectly. I was sorry to find out they we all out of tea sweaters - what a great idea."}
{"text":"McAlister's is one of my favorite places to eat when I want something quick and simple but don't want to think too hard about where to get it.  This location is clean, they keep the line moving, and they keep your drink filled.  There's probably not much more to say than that."}
{"text":"The food is always coming out fast. Every time I come in to eat , I have a good memory of the experience. The management goes above and beyond"}
{"text":"This Mcalister's location could use a lot of improvements. The manager is really nice but needs to focus on the quality of food that comes out of the kitchen. It's just not worth the wait, or money.

I've left multiple times without utensils included in my to-go bag when my meal has relied on such utensils. 

Also, multiple times I've gotten a sandwich that was half the size it should normally be. Today was the last straw when I ordered a Caesar Salad Wrap but only got a wrap packed with chicken and lacking in salad -- 4 leaved don't count...(FYI, at other locations I've had huge Caesar wraps). 

There's always a huge line here at lunch time. So even when I come before the crowd the low quality of product remains the same. Disappointing considering it's so close to my work and so convenient."}
{"text":"Super delicious flavorful food. I had 1/2 California Ruben and 1/2 Italian chopped salad. It was delicious! With a strawberry lemonade and FREE refills!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I was a bit concerned, but we decided to give it a try. We went on kids eat free night, and we got two free kids meals per adult meal. The lady taking our order was very patient with us while our kids decided on what they wanted. Our food came out promptly, and even though we ordered something incorrectly they didn't hesitate to fix it. They checked on us a couple times during our meal, and made sure we had refills before we left. We will be back. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's like the happy median between a fast food joint and a traditional sit down restaurant. The menu is great because a lot of the ingredients are more on the healthy side but the overall meal still taste very good without you feeling like you're eating like a vegan. I had their Cajun Caesar Salad which was very good."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Nice portion size on the Savannah Chopped salad. Clean dining room with attentive servers!  Sweet tea is the best ."}
{"text":"Good food and location, the most pleasant staff, clean, cheery and quick on the refills.  Delightful!"}
{"text":"Two stars today, only because the don't allow half-stars. 

I tried the new BLT+A sandwich as part of a 'Choose 2' combination. The salad portion of my combination was better than my expectations for this location, but the sandwich was, to put it mildly, a hot mess. 

Imagine several strips of bacon  stacked haphazardly on half of a thin slice of bread. Add avocado, tomato, and lettuce. Cover with a second half slice of bread and then squash the result. 

A nice idea for a sandwich but D- for the execution. Never again"}
{"text":"Very successful grand opening! Everyone seemed happy to be working there. I mayyyyy go to various Charlotte McAlister's locations at least weekly, and I found the food here to be the best... by FAR. I'm so glad this opened near my home!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this location.  I called in an order to go which seemed to take forever.  Asked for the california classic which he told me they don't have even though I get it twice a week during lunch in the Matthews location.  I asked for no tomatoes and the fat free peach dressing and ordered the veggie sandwich.  I paid for my order and sat for 20 minutes until the manager looked at me after looking aggravated and looked into where my food had been.  The restaurant was not crowded what so ever- an off time around 2:30 but plenty of employees.  The two guys in the kitchen seemed more concerned with cracking jokes then getting orders out.  The manager brings me my food to tell me it had been sitting there and they didn't know I was there.  Left in disgust without checking my order to find there is tomatoes and a ranch dressing.  Noticeable dust and dirt near the bench I sat to wait for my incorrect order."}
{"text":"Friendly employees that greet you when you walk in, great atmosphere, average noise level, location is great, tables are clean, and not an expensive lunch. . .Service is fast for take out if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"We have gone to this McAlister's Deli a few times to take advantage of the kids eat free on Tuesdays after 5:00 deal. The food is really hit or miss. Sometimes it's pretty good and other times it seems as if it's been sitting in the window for hours. Tonight was the latter. The kids pita pizzas were actually cold and the cheese for the kids nachos had a crust on top as if it had been sitting a long time.

My salad and baked potato were ok. My husbands sandwich was also just ok. The bathroom was not very clean and neither was the floor around and under all the tables around us. Panera bread is across the street and is wonderful. I would expect McAlister's to be on their A game to compete with them...but they're no where near it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Like most McAlister's good food and atmosphere not to mention friendly staff. Take out or dine in this place is perfect for lunch or dinner. The Ultimate Nachos are my new favorite."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Used to go to McAlister's in Texas but first time in Arizona and its just as good and friendly and busy!
My favirite has always been the French Dip, which i personally think is excellent, but today i went with a slightly healthier option of the Savannah Chopped Salad and am so happy with my choice. All the flavors were great, loved the cranberries and devided to try the cherry dressing that was recommended and it went so well with it. I picked the \"Choose 2\" and paired it with the Broccoli and Cheese soup (which I normally get) and it is just as creamy as i remember. If you are looking for an excellent soup, salad, samdwich, or spud place, i definitely recommend. The spuds are also amazing!! I dont think i havr had something i didn't like at a McAlister's. And u am from the south, so yes, sweet tea is a must for me!"}
{"text":"Staff here is super friendly and honest. If you ask them if something is good or not to eat, they'll tell you their opinion or ask someone who has tried it. 

Service is good as well. Staff will check on you every now and again, otherwise you are left alone which isn't always a bad thing. 

Good food, large portions. Definitely try the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Experienced food poisoning  here :( got only a Caesar salad with no meat or anything and was sick for days"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. So tasty. I have been here twice within a few weeks. Got the veggie club and the veggie potato adding on the chili. The sweet tea was wonderful. Be warned the kids meals are small. For .99 each my kids each ate two."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that a McAlister's opened near me! I hadn't realized that there were any in Arizona. I remember finding this place in Memphis when I was a kid. Even in the south they are known for their awesome sweet tea. Honestly, the best sweet tea I have found anywhere in Arizona. I love their giant spuds too! I try to go to McAlister's whenever I am nearby. I was disappointed that they didn't offer me a tea club card though, make sure you ask for one when you go in!"}
{"text":"One of my stops when I am about to fly out. harvest chicken salad is what I typically get and I love it. Lemonade to top it off."}
{"text":"This is by far the smallest McAlister's I've been in. It was well laid out and has relatively new decor. The young lady at the register was clearly new and not fully trained. I had to repeat the order twice and my daughter's sandwich still came out incorrectly. The shift leader wasn't very nice and she appeared to be bothered by my order changes and having to assist the girl in the registered. 

The food was delivered quickly but the girls delivering didn't know the food as they set it down. My choose two Cuban was called a griller and my ultimate nachos weren't on the plate. They came after and in a soup bowl. My food did taste good. My husbands Savannah salad had way too much lettuce and he was not able to enjoy it with the other elements of the salad, since he couldn't find them in the huge pile of lettuce. 

The manager was no where to be found and the shift leader did not check in any tables. We were asked if we wanted refills, but I saw several guests having to get up and go to the counter."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of sandwiches from a lot of different sandwich spots, and I have to say McALISTER's deli by far is the best. I had a turkey rueben which taste great. I will be back"}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant for lunch the other day with 2 friends and was very impressed by all that they have on hand.  The menu, in paper and on the wall, is quite large, and with just enough time to eat and run to the next appointment, I quickly skimmed the menu and settled on a half sandwich (roast beef) and the New England clam chowder.  One friend chose the same as me except the potato soup and a 1/2 of aturkey club, and the other friend chose a cheesy baked potato.  If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter.  It was a very quick and friendly process at this location.  Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you.  Now the food part:  My roast beef sandwich was lacking in thickness of meat, and a bit fatty on the roast beef.  My New England clam chowder was hot...it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'...but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates.  The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together.  The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous.  I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football.  Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder?  Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater.  Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd!  It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella.  
The prices for all these items came up to about $25.00.  Really pretty good for 3 people needing a quick lunch.
I'll go back to McAlister's again, but I think, next time, I'll be ordering that pig skin of a potato!"}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered our deli sandwiches using their app on my iPhone. It was simple and easy to place my order and pay for it. My husband picked it up. The service was excellent. I ordered their ice tea which they are famous for. The food was fresh and very tasty. I would highly recommend this deli to anyone looking for something different from all of the other delis that are out there. They stand apart because they have a menu that is filled with choices and allows you to customize your order. I would have taken a picture, but we inhaled it so maybe next time. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last night and opted for the turkey with pepper jack cheese based on the recommendation from our order taker.  I was thinking Po Boy but opted for the cashier's recommendation. Wife ordered French dip.

The place was fairly quiet for a Saturday night.  The layout was simple and a couple of TVs had a ballgame on.  We had to move from our first table after the ceiling fan above us was placed next to the recessed lighting and was giving my wife and I a strobe light effect.

The sandwich was good but not great.  The potato salad I ordered for my side dish was delicious.   My wife like their sweet tea and she seemed satisfied with her French dip.

The place felt too much like a chain, which it is, I was hoping for a different vibe from a deli. 

Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with McAlister's Deli I was hoping for something closer to a deli than a sandwich shop.  To me there is a big difference. 

Feel free to try it, I probably will wait awhile before I go back."}
{"text":"The food and Service was disgusting. My wife and I had Chili and both of us had severe stomach problems .  I  should go to the Health Department.. I have pictures of the So called food. I spent over $30.00 FOR A CASUAL lunch and for Dog food? Are you kidding? I had one bite of each item and left it . I want a refund . I was there about 3:30 pm 1/11 . There is a serious problem with this location.

You would not eat what you served me.


DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious!

Grilled Chicken Salad - good enough

Spud Max - great! I would definitely get this again.  The Spud Max includes: bacon, cheddar cheese, scallions, and ham.  Add sour cream, and I am in heaven!"}
{"text":"Great soup and salad place. As far as being an authentic Delicatessen, well it misses the mark by a long shot. Adequate Chicken salad on a cousant with a minuscule portion of chips and a pickle spear. Nothing grand. A few dirty tables and idle employees.  However, my octingerian Mother likes it, soooo..."}
{"text":"Mmmm. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm in the mood for a sandwich, salad, or soup kind of lunch. They've got all three, plus large spuds with toppings that taste great too. It's simple, clean, and with great service. Lots of options for all 3: sandwich, salad, or soup. The options are also creative. For example, ORANGE CRANBERRY CLUB
Smoked turkey, hickory ham, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar,
Swiss, lite mayo, lettuce, tomatoes and orange cranberry sauce on
harvest wheat bread. I tried it, and it was a new sensation in my mouth. Had not tried a sandwich with this kind of combination before. (Mostly the orange cranberry sauce add-in) 
Also, the place is Wi-Fi enabled,"}
{"text":"Wonderful deli so close to home! And kids meals are $1.00! My son loves the Mac n cheese, and I always get the spud! I love their baked potato loaded with cheese and bacon! If you are an ice tea fan you can't go wrong with any of the options they have! They are very nice and always offer refills and bring the food to the table! 
It is a great place to go if you are looking for a healthy quick meal! 
I tend to go during lunch hours when it is busier, but the line moves quick and the service is still great! 
One of my favorite deli's in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken cesear wrap, with a side of mac n cheese. I enjoyed my entree and the sweet tea was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend had the pastrami sandwich with mac n cheese, which he said was very good. Knocked  off a star for the not so pleasant cashier."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have enjoyed the food.  I like how everything is made fresh. However the last two times I've been in I have found long dark hairs in my salads.  I really wish the people preparing food would wear hats or hair nets. Rather than a manager teaching the employee better food management they just offer you a free dessert like it happens all the time. I won't be back"}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints with the food at this location. We always get the black bean chilli, which is delicious. My boyfriend gets it in the bread bowl, which is much softer than others that I have come across. I think it's fine, but I know some people may not like that. Their lemonades and teas are also amazing, I have stopped in several times just for a drink.
I also have never had to deal with long lines here.
On the downside, the few times we have stayed to eat, the tables have been quite dirty. The service is also pretty hit or miss. Some of the employees are very friendly while others are not at all.
For me, the positives outweigh the negatives so I will continue to stop in here."}
{"text":"Ok get the pick 2, much better deal and I feel like I got my money's worth. 

Excellent southwest cobb salad and cranberry orange sandwich!

Fresh, fast, and great place!

Try it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Much better than Panera bread! Better atmosphere and food was delicious!! Wednesday night kids eat free at this location!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. The Orange Cranberry Club was delicious, as was their potato salad and Sweet Tea. The young man behind the counter was nice."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly atmosphere! Had to wait a little bit for my sister's order after they brought out mine, but besides that, everything was good! I don't know how they did it, but they knew what I wanted before I even asked. No wonder it's so popular around lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Peach tea is to die for (Half and Half). Choose - 2 deal is an awesome way to try different options. Lots of options for veg and non-veg people. Savannah Chop Salad is must have at McAlister's Deli.  I have been here few times and tried their spuds, soups, sandwiches and salads.  Ambiance is really good and the Staff is very friendly.  Will recommend to everyone wanting to eat good and fresh food!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Expect it to be crowded between 11:30-1. I went for the first time and actually got there when it was no line. I ordered a \"Choose 2\" with half Grilled Chicken Caesar wrap and broccoli cheddar soup and a side of guac. I also ordered a large drink. The staff is pretty young and inexperienced. It's one of those restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table. The waiter filled my drink up too high so it overflowed when I put a lid it on it. I was at the register and there was a line behind me but I was clearly struggling with my drink spilling. She didn't offer to help and called the next person up while I was STILL at the register trying to clean up the mess she caused me to make. I wanted to eat outside so I had to walk passed the whole line of people to get to the outside tables. They brought out my food within 5 mins and no guac came. I went to lunch alone so I was kind of irritated when I had to walk back inside through the line of people to ask for my guac while leaving my food outside on the table by itself ! The same lady who had just taken my order less than 10 mins ago asked for my receipt to make sure I bought the guac and then was like \"oh yeah you paid so I can get you guac\" like no shit? Don't get me wrong, she was nice! Just kinda annoyed me. The food was AMAZING. Literally the only reason why I will be going back. The food was great."}
{"text":"I love the tea and I love the salads. The sandwiches are good, but depending what yout get ate not very large portions."}
{"text":"Savannah chopped salad was no comparison to back home in cinvinnati. Paying almost $10 for a full size salad but received about a half size portion. Although I was visiting the area, if I were to return while I won't rule MD out, I'll just choose a different menu item"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place while in Peoria for the weekend. This place was great! I had the chicken club sandwich with added guacamole. DELISH!!! Good portion. 

I also ordered an sweetened arnold palmer and it was perfect! Just the right combination of tea and lemonade! It was SO refreshing and a pretty large size.

I will be coming back to this place next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"The customer service here is excellent. Every time I go they are exceptionally friendly. Everything on the menu is good and yes better then Panera!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick place to get soup and a sandwich to go and I found it!! Their online ordering system is simple and easy and prices are inexpensive. I ordered the autumn squash soup and a tuna salad sandwich on a wheat banquette. The portions are generous and I loved the soup. The sandwich wasn't bad either. I probably would order a different type of bread next time because it was too much bread. My husband picked up our order so I didn't get a chance to check if all the items were given to us so when he got home, they forgot to give me my peanut butter crispy dessert. Super bummed about that, but my hubby let me try his chocolate chip cookie and that was delicious and super soft."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience here.

I wish a could remember the name of the cashier who helped us/took our order - she has red hair, was well spoken, bubbly and incredibly helpful. She made an awesome first impression.

We both had salads so I can't speak to the deli aspect - I get the impression this places is somewhere between a Jason's Deli and a Panera. The Chopped Italian and Southwestern Cobb were both delicious. Not being sure what dressing to try were given two kinds without an additional cost (who doesn't hate being \"nickled and dimed\" for stuff like that). My Arnold Palmer was delicious (I was a first timer and am hooked now). When asked if I wanted it with sweet or unsweet tea, I must have looked blankly but the cashier said if it was too sweet she would make me something else.  (get sweet BTW) I wasn't sure if refills were included, but the cups are so big, I didn't need one!

The runner who was bringing food to the table got us extra dressing when we ran out and she was really busting her tail. Kudos to her!

So, no it isn't Panera however the food was good, and just as importantly they have a great team working there who I felt wanted me to be happy with my dining experience."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my order today.  In the past I have ordered the wrap and it was decent although today I had the French dip and it was awful.  The best thing about the meal was come zero.  I'll give them one more chance and update review next time."}
{"text":"Family and I went to McAlisters and it is just like the one's in Oklahoma. Very good food for ok prices. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Just don't forget to get some sweet tea!  

On this trip, I got the pick two. I got a cup of soup and a French dip sandwich. My wife got a the grilled chicken spud. Son got Mac and cheese kids meal. Food was hot and delivered very promptly after ordering. All tasted great. 

Pros:
Great food
Good fast service
Sweet tea (I mean c'mon, you have to put it on here!)

Cons:
Can be a bit pricey for a soup and sandwich."}
{"text":"The manager contacted me shortly after I posted this and of course apologize and said the problem was being addressed. \"Supposedly\" a gift card was being mailed to me for my troubles, but that was back in December and it is now February 1 so obviously that was just something to keep me quiet."}
{"text":"The spuds here are huge, oh my lord are they genetically modified crops or what?  Honestly, I don't care because they are great!  The service is friendly; everyone greets you with a smile.  Back to these spuds though, they are loaded with different types of cheeses, vegetables, sour cream, and salsa.  It is a real feat to eat one of these in a sitting, so you get your moneys worth.  I recommend the Grilled Cheese as well.  You choose three different types of cheeses and the bun.  Overall, it was a great eating experience."}
{"text":"It's not bad.  It's not spectacular.  There are a couple of reasons why I do like McAlister's, though.  For one, I'm a \"sharer\", by nature.  I prefer not to order a whole meal of just one item.  If we go out to breakfast, my husband KNOWS that 90% of the time, I would love to share 2 things with him (and frequently he will indulge without too much coercion).  At McAlister's, they let me share with myself!  They have an entree that they call \"Choose 2\".  You may select 2 from any number of half sandwiches, half potatoes (with toppings), small entree salads, or cups of soup.  There are TONS of possibilities.  I ordered 1/2 horseradish and roast beef sandwich, and a cup of broccoli cheese soup.  The soup was rich and pretty tasty without being cloying.  I've had the sandwich before and it was pretty good.  This time, it wasn't warmed thoroughly, but I really didn't care enough to send it back.  That is an example of why it's just middle of the road.

The second reason that I like them is that they offer a \"Kids Eat Free\" promotion on Tuesday nights.   Between the 4 of us, we ordered 2 cups of soup, 2 half sandwiches, a pita pizza, a hot ham & cheese sandwich, a large bag of chips, 2 small bags of Teddy Grahams, and 4 drinks... for $19 after tax."}
{"text":"Consistency.  That's the staple of this quasi fast food chain.  I've never had a bad experience at any of the Charlotte area locations and even though they aren't in the forefront of my mind always, they are always a good \"go to\" choice for lunch or a light dinner.  I love the classic club sandwich and the potato salad is probably my all time favorite.  And then there's the sweet tea....yeah it's good, as good as McDonald's rocket fuel ice tea? Hmmm...close call.  The only thing I don't like is the size of the drinks, it's like a one liter size and doesn't fit my cup holders in my car :("}
{"text":"Slow service. Arrived at noon , party of six. No one on line ahead of us in line. Waited 25minutes for food, while waiting people all around that ordered after us were served. Manager would not take time to help when I went back up to counter to check on food. Food was fine when it finally came. This is the second time this has happened in less than a month. Our company will be going to Jason's Deli just up the street from now on."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review and I can honestly say they gained that extra star to give them 5 stars! Wow! I really enjoyed my to-go order today the McAllister Club looked and tasted delicious, the broccoli cheddar soup was hot and creamy and last but not least the chocolate chip cookie was the cherry on top to the whole meal!  The whole staff is always very acommodating and has great customer service skills which is always a plus!  I will definitely be back thank you so much McAllister's for my satisfying experience today!"}
{"text":"Very slow McAlisters site, showed up on a Friday (it was dead inside) and got my food 15-20 mins later ?"}
{"text":"As a transplant patient there are very few places I can eat. McAlisters is one of them. Service, food & people are excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is worth four stars, the price is worth two, the service is worth two and the cleanliness is worth three or four.
I ordered a chicken Cesar salad. When it came, the dressing was on the side. 
The menu specifically says that all dressings come on the side EXCEPT the Cesar salad.
Anyone who enjoys this kind of salad knows the dressing is tossed into it.
I asked the waitress why it was on the side and she said they all come on the side.
I told her not on the Cesar salad.
She asked the manager and the manager backed her.
I told them then they need to change it on their menu.
I just don't understand how they can't know their own menu.
That alone wouldn't be that bad, but I've been here a handful of times and something always seems to be wrong with my order."}
{"text":"I've given this place so many different chances and they always disappoint.  Usually McCallisters has such great service and such happy employees that are always ready to help....  Not this location at all!!!  So there food is sub par compared to other locations and they always mess up our orders.  We got them for a staff meeting at work and almost half my coworkers meals were not correct.  Then I ordered online a spud the other day and on the ordering system it usually says sub veggie chili for the regular chili well it didn't have it on there..  So I wrote it in the special instructions.  I figured they would not get it right so I decided to call them after I placed my order judt so I could clarify.  Well I talked to someone for a minute he said he was going to check he put me on hold for 4 mins and then hung up on me.  So of course when I went to pick up my order it was incorrect and no chili was even on it.  The employee was extremely rude and not helpful.  Will not be wasting my money at this place again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE, and will NEVER eat here again!! I used to like eating here, but stopped because they kept getting my order wrong every time. I thought I would give them another try so I went back. First time back, they got my order wrong. I called and so they offered me a complimentary meal for the mistake. I went back the following week and of course, they got my meal wrong again. One of my items was a choose 2, and my soup was only half full. When I told management, he said I only get half a cup?? The menu says a cup! If you like mystery meals, and don't mind eating just whatever someone throws in a bag, and also getting only half of what you pay for, this place is for you!! I know I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Another place with kids night were kids eat free. On days when I don't want to cook and with 2 kids these are my spots. 

For a special event on a Tuesday night the restaurant wasn't that crowded. There was maybe three other patrons sitting down. We were able to get an order for really quickly and sit down. Even though we were in quickly the order takers demeanor was not very friendly. Not once did we get a smile or a do you need anything else. And I'm a big proponent on service, being friendly is part of service or at least good service. 

Now going back to the fact that there weren't very many patrons in the restaurant, I would have thought we would have got our food within 15 minutes or less.  We just ordered sandwiches and a salad. We were sitting for at least 30 minutes before our food came. And when did we still had to follow up to get a napkins. Really napkins that should be standard.

Food quality was decent the kids meals were the best,  grilled cheese sandwich and peanut butter and jelly. I do love the fact that all kids meals come with a side as well as a treat which is usually graham crackers. So the kids are usually gone definitely be satisfied. 

Regarding the restaurant it's a great place to come with a large crowd because it's extremely spacious. When you go in there you definitely don't have to crawl over people because you can spread out a little. I like having a little bit of elbow room.

I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been hittin' up new spots once per week to give new sandwiches a try and McAlister's Deli came up in my Yelp feed.  Judging from the reviews from other Yelp'ers, this was a no-brainer.  

Their location is right off Bell & the 101 so it's very convenient.  Smack dab in the middle of restaurant row tucked into a little strip mall.  Very convenient, tons of ample parking and easy access in and out of the parking area.

The restaurant is insanely clean as are the restrooms.  Plenty of ample seating and of course, it's a Wednesday evening so I knew that wasn't going to be a problem.  There is a cool little area adjacent to the entry with bar stools.  Each seat has it's own designated electrical outlet so you can chill out with your phone charger if you're going to do a lot of Yelp'ing and/or get some work done on your laptop or notebook while you're enjoying your meal.  More restaurants need to do this and I'm so happy McAlister's did.  I think it's important to disconnect while you're enjoying your meal, but Wednesday evenings are for a quick bite and getting some work done.  It's nice to see this kind of space at McAlister's.  

It wasn't busy as I mentioned earlier and I had already known what I was going to order even before I walked in the door.  I perused the menu on my lunch break at work today.  It was my first time at their website AND at their restaurant.  I wanted to make sure I was going to order the best sandwich possible.  And I did.  (1) King Club with a side of mac 'n cheese, please!

Looking back at these photos, I've no idea how in the world I ate this thing in its entirety.  I don't know if I should even be alive right now.  No, seriously.  I don't know if I should even be breathing right now.  So let me start from the bottom and work my way up to the top, OK?  It's a piece of toasted white bread, then some honey mustard, then some ham & turkey and then some Swiss cheese and Sharp cheddar and then some bacon with a bunch of green leaf lettuce and tomatoes and more honey mustard.  On top of all that is another pieces of toasted white bread.  Now, any normal human being would call that a pretty darn good sandwich, right?  ...not McAlister's.  On top of that piece of toasted white bread, that entire sandwich STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.  I am not even joking.  It is a colossal club sandwich of epic proportions.   Check out my pics!  The bread was fresh and toasted to perfection.  The meat was juicy and fresh.  The lettuce and tomatoes were abundant and also fresh.  The cheese was straight outta Wisconsin and all of that deliciousness was piled from here to the Milky Way.  You guys.  I know.  I know it's just a sandwich, but good God!  Sooooooo much awesomeness!  It is physically impossible to not look like a complete dork as you're shoving this thing into your mouth.  Forget the naysayers and forget the fact that when you're about to take your first bite - you're going to wish you could unhinge your lower jaw like a boa constrictor taking on prey much too large for its size.

My behemoth of a sandwich came with a side and I chose the mac 'n cheese.  The nice woman behind the counter rattled off like five other items, but when she got to mac 'n cheese, I was like - Whoa there, Tonto!  Whoaaaaa!  I will take the mac 'n cheese off your hands, if I may.  Equally as delicious as my sandwich, although, the proportion size was not as epic, but that's to be expected since it was a side and not a meal.  

Anywho, McAlister's is also famous for their baked potatoes which are apparently a meal all unto themselves.  AND their iced tea is also something of magnificence which has won awards and Pulitzer Prizes and other famous brass heavyweight awards.  I'm totally joking about that  last part, but from what I've heard - their iced tea is equally epic.  Unfortunately, due to the ridiculous size of this sandwich, I was not fit to try a baked potato or consume any iced tea at this visit.  If you've not eaten for weeks, I'd suggest the King Club.  If you're looking for a nice, chill, laid back spot with a lot of good food choices, I would highly recommend McAlister's!   Soooo good!   Kudos to all of you for an awesome meal!  I shall return with family and friends!"}
{"text":"If you are into chicken then southwest chicken sandwich was really good! I would recommend the sweetened ice tea, they have free refills too.
The place is refreshing and I wish they had opened when I was still at ASU, would've been a perfect lunch place for me!"}
{"text":"I only order one thing the McAllister's club but it is a very tasty club sandwich the service is always good here as well"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal!!! Makes Jason's Deli taste like Subway. I'm working on the whole menu and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite so far is the Big Nasty. You must try their sweet teas. Kids meals without a drink are only $0.99!!! The manager, Cody, is extremely friendly and it reflects on his staff. The service exceeds expectation."}
{"text":"If your from the east coast or parts of the midwest, you may laugh at the \"deli\" moniker, but I guess it qualifies as an AZ deli!  The thing I like about this place is their variety of options for their \"pick 2\" combo meals.  Mainly the NACHOS.  Ok they aren't the greatest nachos I've ever had, but getting a small bowl of loaded up nachos with a soup, sandwich, salad, or even a baked potato??  That's music to my ears as I'm someone who treasures variety! (Hey, it's the spice of life, right?!?)

They are also really big on their fresh-brewed tea.  They give it to you in a huge cup, and it's very tasty.  Sometimes I even make it an Arnold Palmer!"}
{"text":"Expensive for dinky portions. Beware the soup and salad \"deal\" unless you brought a microscope.  My pastrami was still cool - unevenly toasted and really wasn't great pastrami either.   The sweet tea is ok, but not orgasm inducing as rumored. The bag of chips that accompanies a sandwich is suspiciously not presented to you but rather you get the chips you request on the side - seemed like less than come in the standard single serving bags displayed at the counter.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought it was suspect.

And worst of all, if you have a bad experience like I did, the comment cards expect you to affix postage.  I'm not going to invest any money telling them how to improve their overpriced chain restaurant."}
{"text":"First off don't go on a Sunday after church! The so called Christians come in the door and stake out the large tables before they even order, so if you are with a large group of adults skip it and go to a place that doesn't do the self seating thing. 

Now to the food, I got a French Dip with chips and a pickles. The sandwich was cooked perfect, the chips where from a bag and the pickle seemed a little old. I really enjoyed it overall except for the table saving.

UPDATE

District manager contacted me regarding my review. Because of prompt action by management going to up my review by one star because I feel like the issue of seat saving by large groups will be addressed."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a McAlister's before but it was great from start to finish, service food and atmosphere. Best lunch place I've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"I always go to McAlister at Carolina Place Mall or the one at Blakney. My co-worker took me to this location for my birthday. I always get the veggie sandwich and it comes with one side. The services at all three locations are always great. It reminds of Jason Deli. My co-worker ordered our food online, and it was ready when we get there. I love the ice tea at McAlister. If you are a meat eater, the chick club is always very good too Plenty of parking space at this location."}
{"text":"My experience at McAlister's today was actually just fine. The staff was attentive and friendly. I ordered the veggie club and it came as described and I enjoyed it. Although they mismatched my table number and my ticket number, someone tracked me down - I didn't have to wait longer than I expected. This store has an outdoor dining area which is a plus on a pretty day like today. Tea = very good and lots of it."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was awesome. Received our food in a timely manner. Place is clean and plays good music."}
{"text":"4**** Great deli. Order at counter, they bring it out to you. Not fast, took about 10 minutes to get 2 sandwiches and a baked potato. But worth the wait. Tasted wonderful!
5**** Our 2nd visit a month later. Wonderful service. They brought out my food before the 2nd person in my group had finished ordering. Broccoli cheese soup and 1/2 a Reuben. Really good! With visits at 5pm. Not busy. Very clean. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow. We used to come here often, very often, but since one opened in Mooresville we haven't been by this location in quite a while. Sadly, our recent visit was not good in any way.

We arrived before the Friday lunch crowd and promptly stopped in the restroom to wash our hands after our playground adventures. The restroom was disgusting. Counter top soaked, paper towels overflowing the trashcan, toilets....gag. Mildew-y plunger was a lovely touch. It gives the restroom that Frat House feel I'm sure the kids from neighboring Davidson College greatly appreciate.

After washing off the playground dirt (and restroom funk) we proceeded to order a french dip, Savannah salad, and two PB&J kid's meals. The salad was good, though one piece of the chicken was an odd gray color and texture. The PB&J woulda been hard to screw up. The kicker was the side of mashed potatoes & gravy. My son's potatoes were like kindergarten paste. Totally inedible even w/added gravy. Then there was the French Dip. 90% bread, 10% cool meat. Not hot. Not warm. Cool. To quote Clara Peller: \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?\" The Mooresville location always manages to provide a well balanced bread to meat ratio...not a heaping portion that falls apart, but enough HOT roast beef to get a satisfying taste w/each bite. This time around, I literally had bites of nothing but bread.

If the server had not been nice and the dining room very clean, the food would rate just one star."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on a Saturday and it was extremely empty.   The restaurant was clean and inviting.   The menus are up on the wall and there are a variety of soups, salads, sandwiches and baked potatoes.   There is also a nice kids menu.  You order your food, they give you a number and you sit down and they deliver the food to you.   

We ordered an Italian sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese which we were going to split.   The iced tea at slightly over $2 was enormous.  They served the sandwich on 2 plates which was nice.  The sandwich was very tasty and the ingredients all seemed very fresh.  The Mac and cheese would have been excellent if it had been hot.  

Overall, good food and pleasant atmosphere.   We waited quite a while for our food considering there were few customers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Sunday with the fam after hearing great things about it. While ordering I felt like we were waisting this guys time. We ordered and tried to grab a table. All the open booths had previous guests plates and leftover food on them. We asked the guy taking our order to see if they could bus the tables to make room but I wasn't going to hold my breath. They never came and so we moved the plates and bowls to another table and I ran to the bathroom to grab some paper towels and soap to clean the table. Our food came and we were disappointed again. The small portions all around and the \"meh\" quality of the food, presentation and size for the price will keep us from going here again. There are better places for us to spend our money and you might want to consider trying either a different McA's Deli location or if your in the area, consider Le Peep or another chain."}
{"text":"First time to this location. I've been to the one located by paradise valley mall before and enjoyed it so I was stoked when I saw this one open up. Honestly the only thing I've had here is the French dip. I like French dip sandwiches from time to time and this place has a legit go-to Fdip. Service was prompt, correct, friendly, and professional. Food was flavorful, correct temperature, and the sandwich had a generous helping of black angus roast beef. My fiancé had the French dip as well and loved it. Both of us went with a side of Mac n cheese which was hot and cheesy. All and all this place isn't a deli (don't be fooled by the name) it's a sandwich shop, but it's a solid spot to get some soup, salad, or a sammy."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a big old sweet tea! If you can't make up your mind, get pick two. My favorite is the Italian salad and Spud Ole! Their spuds are delicious and very filling! If you are extra hungry get a nacho basket. They take your order and then give you a number and will bring it to your table. If you need a quick place for lunch, give it a try!"}
{"text":"So, today is the fifth time that I have visited this particular location since I have been working in the Gastonia area. And, today is the third time that they have screwed up my order. About two weeks ago I ordered a salad for take out. When I got back to my office and as I was cutting up my salad, I suddenly noticed a balled up yellow receipt in the bottom of my container. Gross! And it wasn't even for my order! I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager he told me to come back and he would make another salad for me himself. I had no worries that they would do this because McAlister's has really good customer service. The inconvenience was me having to get back into my car and drive back to the restaurant all the while being hungry and ready to eat. He did give me a free drink for my troubles.  The second screwup occurred within that same week. Again, I ordered a salad and asked for blue cheese dressing. When I got back to my office and began to pour the dressing on top of my salad I realized that it was ranch dressing not blue cheese. I don't like their ranch dressing so this totally ruined my salad. I again called and spoke with the same manager his name was Andy by the way. He even remembered my name before I could tell him that it was the same lady he had spoken to earlier in the week. He again apologized and offered me a free salad and a free drink. Of course, I had to drive back to get the second salad. This time he gave me a gift card for $10. Now that was a nice touch. Now we come to today. I ordered something new off the menu. It was supposed to be a Cobb Club sandwich. Which is supposed to come with turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, Gorgonzola cheese, and mayo. I used my $10 gift card to get this sandwich. Something told me that I should have checked my order right there at the counter before I walked away. But I thought to myself, what are the chances of them screwing up my order three times in a row. Well I was wrong. I looked at my sandwich and lo and behold there is no bacon to be found and, in addition, no avocado although I do see small smears of something green which I presume to be avocado. I was expecting avocado slices. Silly me! So, as I am writing this review, I am pondering whether or not I should call my BFF Andy again to to bring this to his attention. This is the moment when you don't want to be seen as a pestering troublesome customer. However, I hate to keep coming back to this location only to be nervous that my order is going to be wrong. I know, I know, first world problems!! I think what I will do from now on is to definitely check my order right there at the counter and have it corrected before I leave the building. I am giving McAlisters a 3 star rating only because the manager was very nice and gracious and was willing - without an attitude - to correct my order."}
{"text":"This was the best service! So quick and GREAT food. Nice people! There is a huge comparison against  The Japanese steak house (fugini)
. (Do Not Go) the \".        \".  It's horrible wait and mixup of food."}
{"text":"We just tried the four cheese chili cavatappi as part of the choose two lunch meal. This chili is awesome over the macaroni and the cheese adds a nice creamy texture. I paired the pasta with a smoky pepper jack turkey sandwich which is always one of my favorites. As always the ice tea is the best in town."}
{"text":"I like this chain. The value is better than you find at a Panera or Bruegger's. Larger portions and a little more variety than both places. It has a much smaller bakery but their focus here is clearly entree sized action. We were able to walk right up to the counter and our cashier was very friendly and helpful. I got the \"choose 2\" with Caesar and potato soup. It was the typical style of baked potato(Bacon, chives, cheese.) Very good and very hot! My wife got the turkey Reuben. The turkey is smoked and was perfectly matched with a very saucy coleslaw. Oh, I almost forgot about the nachos.... do it! They had so much chili and cheese on them! 5 stars and we'll be back a third trip."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better sandwich shops around even though there is nothing special that really stands out. Parking can be difficult if its busy though that rarely happens when I have gone. The employees are very very friendly. The place is clean and food comes out quickly. 

They recently posted a lent friendly menu which I found convenient."}
{"text":"This location is always clean, very friendly and quick. The food is a good option for a quick meal that doesn't fall under the junky, fast food trap. I have never had anything here that wasn't fresh and prepared exactly how I like it. If you have kids, on Tuesday kids eat free from 5-9pm. Always a plus when you have a family. Had a great experience as always and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Always the best service and great food!! Great place to take the family don't forget to get a sweet tea!!"}
{"text":"Mcalister's Deli is located in Concourse C of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

Had lunch here one afternoon. Had their Chipotle Turkey Melt - a sub with Turkey, Chipotle, Bacon, Pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions - on a sub roll.

The sandwich is served warm - the cheese is melted and the bacon has been heated up a bit. Overall, it was a scrumptious sandwich and very filling! I picked up a bag of chips and a bottle of cold water to go with it!"}
{"text":"HUGE FREAKN SALADS!!! thats honestly all i remember about going. 


I got a sandwich there, it was pretty good. I remember feeling hungry afterwards though. Wish the sandwiches there were a bit bigger."}
{"text":"What happened to McAlister's?  Just finished dinner - what I could eat of it.  The baked potato was underdone and barely warm.  The cheese and butter wouldn't melt if that tells you anything.  The salad was flavorless and the portions were TINY.  My sister got a orange cranberry club and potato salad - it looked like a kids plate.  Seriously, what happened? You can tell they are cutting back - no extra napkins or croutons on the salad.  Weird."}
{"text":"Their staff working today are EXCELLENT. Food is fresh and serving sizes are good  (more than your money then Panera.) The chilli soup was too greasy, I couldn't finish it. The broccoli  cheddar soup was tasty and well seasoned"}
{"text":"I've always had a difficult time reviewing these types of places. I mean, they're practically all clones of each other. McAllister's is your typical cookie-cutter deli that would fit in well at any suburban strip mall or airport terminal. Soups, sandwiches, salads, cookies . . . yeah, yeah. I know the drill.

I had the ham and cheese toastie, while my girlfriend ordered the chicken salad sandwich. We both ordered sides of broccoli cheese soup and I threw in a cup of mac and cheese for good measure. 

Both sandwiches were okay and pretty much on par with what you'd find at any one of the hundred or so other places that offer the same choices. Portions were a bit small for the price. The mac and cheese was actually decent, especially in comparison to the god-awful sludge I had at a barbeque place recently. The soup was your usual stuff. 

Thankfully, the chocolate chip cookie we split was free via Yelp check-in, because it was a flat-out disgrace. Enough for me to drop them to two stars, even! They are baked in house, but it appears that they only had them in the oven for five minutes. They were incredibly doughy, with very little evidence that they were even baked at all. 

Sadly, I don't see this place being worthy of a repeat. But at least we gave them a try, I guess."}
{"text":"Normally a great spot for lunch, but not today.  We ordered 4 sandmiches, chips & drinks at 12:51pm and did not get our food until 1:20pm!  Really...almost 30min for 4 cold sandwichs.  Did I mention that 3 of the sandwichs were supposed to be hot & we had to ask for the \"dip\" for the French dip?  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Called in advance to ensure that this location had baked potatoes available and that they would have them in stock. The Spud was indeed giant. It fit into a square styrofoam takeout container along the diagonal. We ordered the angus spud which seemed to be just cheese and sandwich meat. There were literally four strands of some kind of dehydrated onion that looked caramelized but tasted like nothing. I liked the gooey melted cheese but the rest was pretty meh. But it was big and they gave us lots of butter (in small plastic packets that I was too lazy to fish out the butter with my knife so we ate it dry). 

I ordered a salad. It was a pretty serious disappointment. The tomatoes were tiny chopped bits of a tomato, probably amounting to less than 1/4 of a tomato, including the inedible stem portion. The almonds and cranberries were good but I couldn't find any cheese in my salad at all. The meat was once again thinly sliced sandwich meat all crushed up which was surprisingly difficult to eat on a salad. The lettuce itself was brown and wilting in many spots--mostly romaine with a few leaves from a mixed greens pack. 

I had a $2 off coupon and it still came out to over $15 for a baked potato and a crappy chopped salad. Pretty sure I won't be coming back unless there's a potato emergency. The space was clean but even at an off hour the seating was limited and awkward. They closed off the main trash can while we were there and so you had to go into the kitchen to throw things away, weird! Peeps were nice, though, for sure."}
{"text":"Nice for on the go lunches. Workers are polite and courteous of guests, food is always delicious and arrives quickly. We order catering here a good bit for work and it is always a favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a whim with the girlfriend. This place is in a great location and the restaurant itself is clean and neat.  Service was great and the employees were very attentive with refills and customer care. I  ordered the horseradish roast beef griller, it was a good sandwich the amount of roastbeef on the sandwich tself was a little small, more bun than beef. The potato salad was great. My significant other had the Orange Cranberry Club and she said,  \" it was fabulous\"!  So she rated it four stars to my  three and a halfish. The ice tea as advertised is just plain awesome! All in all I like this place and will come back to check out another sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been McAlisters fan for a while now and have always loved their food and service...until now.

I've noticed a decline in the quality and quantity of their food in the last year. Smaller portions and not as good ingredients. I have ordered the same thing and the same locations and have definitely noticed a difference. 

This one on this particular night was extremely understaffed. 7 tables within view that have not been cleared in at least 30 minutes. 20 minutes later and no food (which has been sitting on the counter for over 5 minutes). Lots of waiting people. Long line. Not good for this Baxter McAlisters if they want to succeed in busy Baxter."}
{"text":"My rating: 0

I know and love this deli in another state.
I was excited that they would be opening near me in Cleveland.

I went there 3x when they first opened.

The staff are L-A-Z-Y! 
They do not make the sandwiches as described on menu board and take an inordinate amount of time to prepare the orders.
I ordered a sandwich with turkey and avocado-my sandwich came without avocado and I asked for it to be remade.
It took F-O-R-E-V-E-R to return my sandwich supposedly remade-but it was the same.
I went to complain and asked where the avocado was and the person who I think was the manager argued that it did not come with avocado even though the menu board listed it-he acted surprised as if he did not know how to put the order together.

I called the survey at the corporate office after 2 more horrible mixed -up visits and the manager called me back to offer me a free sandwich-but too late-I'm done.

Their North Olmsted location is not prime- outside the mall food court and close to a few restaurants. It's a miss for me."}
{"text":"I like McAlisters. They are always a good choice for lunch or dinner. They have more of a variety than Panera amd at more reasonable prices (although it seems like that may be chaning). The spuds are very good, love the nachos, the broccoli cheddar soup is some of the best I've jad, along with the mac and cheese...there is something on the menu for everybody.  I've never had bad service at this Matthews location,  the folks at the counter and servers always seem to have a smile and are helpful. This is always my fall back when I don't know what I am hungry for!"}
{"text":"This is a nice location with plenty of seating.

Located at the four corners in Ballantyne in the Helen Adams Realty Corner of the Quad, it is directly across the parking lot from Harris Teeter.

Serving a variety of sandwiches, salads and spuds, you can even choose two smaller sides as a meal for a great price.

Service is quick, friendly, and the establishment has always been clean.

This is a regular spot when we are looking for a quick, somewhat healthy meal.

{"text":"Living in New York has really raised my standards on Deli's. I would say this is about the same as any basic bodega in New York. Would be just as happy with a subway sandwich"}
{"text":"We always enjoy Going to this location. It's in a popular business park, so it's not surprising to stand in a line to order. The restaurant is usually sensitive and responsive to longer lines and quickly opens additional registers. Service is friendly and timely and we are never disappointed with our visits. I love the spicy chicken griller sandwich and typically don't venture out and try other stuff. I have had a stuffed potato and those are good as well. This location is on the regular list when we are in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"First time eating here tonight and I ordered a chipotle chicken sandwich. Overall, it was an average sandwich. It came on a grilled panini with the grilled chicken and the sweet, chipotle sauce. 

The sauce was a little too sweet for me. It was a pretty small portion for the price. I had the macaroni cheese as a side and that was excellent. Great tasting cheese flavor to the noodles. 

The other members of my party had different types of salads with baked potatoes and they loved it. I tried the potato and it was pretty good. Loaded with cheese, ham and turkey bits, tomatoes,  and onions.

I'll come here again for another sandwich, but was impressed with the one I had."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times (at least 10) for lunch and have settled on the half-muffaletta as my meal of choice.  Great with some tabasco sauce (shouldn't be a surprise since both are from Louisiana!).  They recently changed their cole slaw recipe - the new recipe is really bad, I actually had to return it.  I've had their baked potato twice and it was dry both times, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this McAlisters, literally, at least once a week. Not anymore.  My last visit was about a month ago and I decided I won't be back for a long while, if ever. The food was not good at all. The cheese in the nacho basket was old and an odd color. It also had that nasty \"skim\" over the top of it. Yuck.
I had a choose any 2 combo with a cup of soup and a 1/2 sandwich. The soup cup was only about 1/2 full and the sandwich had stale bread and wilted lettuce. 
I don't even want to tell you about the nasty bathroom. Ewwww. It would help if someone would go in there and at least wipe down the mirror and countertop.
The only thing good about the visit was the tea. 
I plan to go to the Mooresville location to get my McAs fix from now on..."}
{"text":"This quick-service sandwich chain is a welcome new addition to the valley.  If you're looking for a comparison to somewhere more established; think Paradise Bakery, but take away the coffee and baked goods and replace it with a much bigger meal selection, and lower prices.  Like most Paradise locations, McAlister's has its customers order at the register, gives a number, and brings the food to them.

I had the New Yorker (corned beef, pastrami, swiss and spicy mustard on rye) with a side of potato salad.  Very good.  Not close to anything you'd find in a New York deli, but on par with anything I'd expect from a sandwich shop.  The potato salad was pretty good as well.  My fiancé went with the choose two (half orders of two menu items) with a grilled chicken sandwich (comes with lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard on a croissant) and a baked potato.  Both were delicious.

We both also had the tea (the sweet tea appears to be something McAlister's is known for).  Not being a big sweet tea fan, I asked for half unsweetened.  This worked out well for me.  If you're a sweet tea fan, you'll probably love the real thing.

McAlister's staff is very welcoming and friendly.  Maybe a little too friendly.  The soda and tea fountains are behind the counter, but they have no problem refilling your drink for you.  In fact, a worker will pass your table and ask if you want a refill.  Several times.  It almost felt like they were looking for something to do.   But it's nice and unexpected service, so I will not complain.

The one thing I will complain about is the menu board.  It either needs be moved up or reprinted much bigger.  The meals are listed in white font against a black background.  While the names are easy to read, the descriptions are small and are tough on the eyes.  I'm 32, my fiancé is 27, and we both had to look at a takeout menu instead of steer at the board.  I can't even imagine what this would be like for older people.  It felt like McAlister's was reminding me it's time for my annual visit with my optometrist."}
{"text":"There must be a rule for McAlister's restaurants that each location must have limited parking.   This one doesn't seem to get as busy as some of the other area locations but there is still the shortage on parking at peak times.

For the most part, the food here is consistent with other McAlister's.  A typical sandwich and side place and wonderful iced tea.  

Just stay away from the Chicken Tortilla soup.  It's more like a think sauce than a soup and it has tiny bits of chicken.  The spuds taste like that are nuked.  But the sandwiches I've had here have always been good.  

The staff at this location does not seem to be as attentive in refilling your beverages as some of the other locations around town but it's never overly busy so you can always take your cup up to the counter and not have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Ok the tea is still good but the sandwiches are getting skimpier -- less meat and other contents and more bread.  

The mashed potatoes as a side are also going the route of being over salted.  

With so many other sandwich places around these days and parking being an issue during peak hours, I think I may have to cross this one off my lunch list...

It's ok...but it used to be so much better..."}
{"text":"The McAlister's is in the mall and doesn't suffer from the parking issues that most other locations suffer from. Of course you might not find a close parking space but if you can't find one at all at the mall, it's probably around Christmas time.

The food here is consistent with other McAlister's lccations and the tea is some of the best tea around.  I also enjoy the patio at this location since it's right outside the mall.  It's a good place to people watch, one of my favorite hobbies."}
{"text":"I came back here today (6/21/2013) to grab a veggie griller sandwich for dinner with a side of potato salad (see picture).  When I walked in I was welcomed by the worker at the order counter. She was very courteous and nice, patient and offered pretty good advice, or at least she tries to. I asked her between the mashed potato and the potato salad, which side was better. She said definitely the potato salad. I never tried the mashed potato here but the potato salad I got was pretty great, at least much better than my sandwich. To proceed with my story, after she took my order, She handed the order over the kitchen counter and gives it to another high school/college student who is making the orders. The cook looked like she was ready to get out and dislikes her job a lot. I picked a table out on the patio to sit, which was quite nice. It has a sun roof, metal tables and chairs, fenced in privacy with the shrubs. My order was brought out to me by the lady who took my order. When she puts my food down she asked if I wanted anything else. 

The food was OK. I think it definitely reflects that not a lot of attention was put on the making of the food, by the impatience of the cook. My veggie griller was a 3/5 ish...so it was not AMAZING like the girl who took my order had said. But it's alright, at least she was trying to be peppy and encouraging. 

You cannot refill your own drinks at Mcalister's. You also cannot order fries with your sandwich, which is not an option for the sides. The ambiance is dark on the inside, that is why I chose to sit on the patio. I have tried several of Mcalister's sandwiches and none of them were more than a 3/5. That is the thing, if you are ok with paying an average of $8.50 for a sandwich and a small side made by an inexperienced high schooler cook. I have nothing against Mcalister's hiring the younger population, because I know how it is when you need to make money for the summer or during the school year to have some pocket money. However, this is just something customers need to take into consideration, you can't expect gourmet sandwichs here. I think the next time I go back I'll try one of their spuds(fancy baked potato)...But i have not yet been able to justify paying $8 for a baked potato..."}
{"text":"I'm big on customer service and I received the best. Had to work while getting an oil change and they made sure I had a seat with a  outlet and the manager was so pleasant.  Came around to each table and made sure you had everything you needed."}
{"text":"Delicious turkey melts and the Italian sandwich is zesty and very unique! The turkey melt was fabulous and the veggies are always fresh! I also loved the tea and the chocolate spoon cake. The staff is always so nice as well. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Good selections, good value, very solicitous staffing.  Love the  1/2 sandwich and small salad combo options."}
{"text":"The smoked pepper jack turkey sandwich and the broccoli cheese soup is delicious! You must try both. However, for almost  $4, I think the cup of soup is too small. We also had the ham n cheese spud and the bread bowl. 

Regarding customer service, the guy who took our orders seemed like he didn't want to be there. You can see it in his whole body language. When he brought our food to the table, we asked for butter and sour cream, but we eventually had to go up to the counter and ask someone else since he never returned. Please work on the service as we will give it another try."}
{"text":"I was in between giving this place 2-3 stars because...I had the nacho salad with chili and omg...it was gross! I barely ate any of it. Literally the worst \"salad\" I've ever had. The sandwiches on the other hand are good, but some times I feel like they are barely warm. The potato salad is store bought, I feel like they microwave their Mac n cheese. The ice tea...not sure what the type is."}
{"text":"I am so happy they finally opened up in Arizona! This place is way better then Panera or Paradise Bakery and not overpriced at all. Everything I've ever ordered here is delicious, especially any of the spuds and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I also love their Chicken Tortilla Soup in the bread bowl. The portions are spot on and I highly recommend when you are craving any sort of deli food!"}
{"text":"I'm quite disappoint at my experience here today. As usual I ordered a Reuben Who knew that it was a hard sandwich to make? Apparently it is at this place. I asked for extra thousands island dressing to my order and what I get instead is no sauerkraut they put the thousand Island dressing on the side and then they added some kind of honey mustard on the sandwich. And I would like to add in how much I hate mustard.  Had taken a picture but don't know how to upload it. Needless to say they lost my business."}
{"text":"Love the choose 2 option. They are polite and the employees and managers here do a good job of keeping it clean. The spuds are awesome."}
{"text":"I pop in here to grab a quick sandwich every once in a blue moon.  The restaurant is usually clean (tables, floors) and the staff is friendly.  

We stopped in today and I had 12\" roast beef and cheddar with a cup of clam chowder for my side.  The old lady (hahaha) had a chicken salad sandwich with a cup of gumbo as her side.  We both had drinks as well which brought the grand total to $24.  I thought that was a bit pricey for what we got albeit what we had was good.

I give them 3 stars mostly on price/value."}
{"text":"Manager contacted me. Excellent. He reads reviews. He followed through. Made changes. The place was very clean and organized. Out of all the deli type sandwich shops in the valley, this one rates the highest in quality of product. Good job."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection.  Full table service.  But you order at the counter.  Pretty nice place.  Great sweet tea and coke products."}
{"text":"Not a great lunch experience. Food was average, but we had a hard time communicating with the woman who took our to go order. After waiting some time, I thought heard her mumble our to go order name, but she gave it away to another couple who was clearly in a rush. I walked up and asked if she said our name, and rather than respond, she ran outside to get our food and brought it back in. It was at least a 15 minute wait, just to have our food given to someone else and had I not been paying attention, we probably would have had to wait another 15 minutes for them to make our food again. This location needs better communication and order. Probably won't return.

After leaving this review, McAlister's reached out to discuss my experience. They really want their customers to have the best experience possible within their restaurants. I appreciate them reaching out and showing they care."}
{"text":"This location is a hidden gem.  It sits back off the road and behind a fast food place so it's kinda hard to see unless you know what you're looking for.  This suits us just fine as it results in this location not being so crazy busy like some of the other locations.  I got the Pick Two with a ham & cheese toastie paired with a Savannah chopped salad.  It was so good, so fresh and super tasty!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  The service is excellent...the tea is excellent...and I love the chipolte chicken panini. It has me hooked that I don't want to try anything else!  Thank you for opening in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I purposely did not read the other reviews before writing mine. I did not understand why the stars were so low.

I have eaten at this chain before and thought the food was good and the variety in choices was great.  They always have several choices of \"Soups of the Day\".

My wife ordered a Chicken Tortilla Soup and we split a Muffaletta.

She said her soup was good, not the best she had ever had but good.

The Muffaletta was very good.  I prefer the bread that does not have sesame seeds on it but that is they bread they use here. (there are basically 2 types of bread used for muffalettas)

So overall the food was better than good.

The place was packed and the line to order long.  I was very impressed with the speed the orders were taken.  It only took about 6 minutes for the line to go down for our turn to order.  We were given our drinks and a number to place at our table for out food to be delivered.

It only took about 8 1/2 minutes for our food to be delivered to our table.  Our server was very nice and brought extra napkins without being asked.

Our experience was a good one and when in the area we will be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this location previously. I have had mixed visits, which is why I haven't returned in quite some time. They were usually very slow even when there aren't that many patrons. That is frustrating when I only have an hour for a lunch break.

This most recent visit left me (and my coworkers) dumbfounded. I had soup with my pick two order and never got crackers. Not a big deal at all - I never even thought about it. As the employee was coming around he asked if I wanted crackers. \"Sure. That'd be great.\" I replied. On his way back, he THREW one package of crackers on my plate and he dropped a second package on the floor near me. I never had a chance to pick them up, on his way back by he then proceeded to pick them up FROM THE FLOOR and throw them on my plate nearly touching my sandwich....... WHAT?!

I'l stop here."}
{"text":"I like McAlister's.  Just found out about this location in Baxter.  The employees were friendly and helpful. 

The tomato bisque soup was very, very tasty!  I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. This was disappointing.  The Elmer's glue I ate in Elementary school tasted better. It seemed as if this batch had been sitting around all day long.

I would return."}
{"text":"I don't like McAlister's.  I think it's because I can never figure out what I want to eat.  It's not that their menu doesn't sound good, because it's not bad.  But it's because the whole thing just leaves me feeling underwhelmed.  Who wants a sandwich that costs as much as (or more) than a full meal?

This time I finally settled on a half-and-half (I have no idea if this is the name or not), but I had a half sandwich and a bowl of soup.  The food itself is pretty decent.  That isn't the problem.  The problem is that it cost something like $8, I was still hungry and it took 15 minutes to get there.  Not to mention the ten minutes it took me to figure out what I wanted.  Just not a fun time."}
{"text":"As has been mentioned by others, I'll go to McAlister's and promptly stand there looking at the menu board with absolutely no idea what to order. It's not that there isn't anything appetizing, as most of the menu actually sounds decent. Maybe I don't properly see the font or something. It's just that everything blurs together and I am in complete paralysis with no idea what I want to order.

Eventually I'll decide on something and am relatively happy with what I order, and while I'm sitting there chomping away happily, I'll glance up and say \"d'oh, should have ordered...\". Which I promptly forget the next time.

As to the process? It works well enough. They give you a number, and they bring it out, and like most places, they aren't especially happy about the whole thing, but they aren't upset either. It just is what it is. Better than fast food, not as good as an upscale dinner. Works in a pinch."}
{"text":"Came here for a to go order and ordered my food right away. I didn't wait long for my food and wanted it to go. I got a large sweet tea and you can't ever go wrong with that. I got the pick two. I got the cup of chili and it's always so good. I also got the southwest chicken salad. Comes with the grilled chicken, corn, cheese and guacamole. It's so good and has a great flavor to it. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Quick service at the front counter. I love their chili and broccoli and cheddar soup. Nachos are good and hefty. Spuds are huge. They are famous for their tea but in my opinion, I don't think it's sweet enough."}
{"text":"Service was much better. Got a to go order from here and was overall pleased. Everything was securely wrapped and we had to go silverware and plenty of napkins. 

I love their chili. You can't go wrong with either. They have the regular chili with just meat and the vegetarian chili with just beans. The veggie chili has more of a spice to it which I love. 

I tried their southwest chicken salad for the first time. Had fresh mixed greens with cheese, grilled chicken, corn and tomatoes. Comes with a side of chipotle ranch and guacamole which made it delicious. 
 
You can't go wrong with their sweet tea! Their strawberry lemonade is also very refreshing!"}
{"text":"The deal here is the half combos.  The Savannah salad is pretty tasty minus the test-tube chicken.  It has gorgonzola cheese, lots of tart cranberries, cucumbers, pecans and chopped tomatoes.  Good size for a half portion.  My other half is always the chicken salad and croissant.  It's not huge but I walk out of there satisfied.  My mom loves the baked potato with the angus steak junk.  I could only imagine how many calories, sodium and fat two potatoes have but my mom didn't seem to mind.  Guarantee when she is down here that's were we'll stop.  The tea is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff. I've been here twice and both times ordered the club sandwich, which is really good, especially with the honey mustard. Both times it wasn't busy at all (lunch on weekdays). The music is not too loud, so the ambiance is relaxed and mellow. Definitely will be returning when in the area again."}
{"text":"I'm a very frequent customer of Mcallister's Deli. I love the food here, however, I have been disappointed by the service many times. Just yesterday, I ordered clam chowder soup, then waited about 15 minutes before a server came out to my table to tell me they were out of clam chowder. No big deal, I told her I'd be fine with the chicken tortilla soup. I also asked her if they had cheesecake because I wanted to order a slice after I ate my soup. She told me yes, they had cheesecake. A while later, I finished my soup and ordered cheese cake. Then again I waited like 7 or 10 minutes for someone to come out and tell me they were out of cheesecake. This is the second time they have been out of cheesecake. Not cool! Anywho, love the food, just wish they would tell me the moment I order if they are out of something. That's all. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I read the comments from other Yelpsters and don't agree.
I found the restaurant to be clean, the staff friendly and service was very fast!
Now to the food. I had a hankering for a good club Sammy, and this is club heaven. I had the Black Angus and the wife had the McAlister; both were tasty. They have great soups. 
All I can say is, this was my first McAlister visit, but look for more to follow, cause \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"This is a very respectable deli with a sound business model. The one on Franklin St is a Carolina staple, and this one is pretty good too. I recommend their grilled sandwiches, particularly their southwest chicken panini! It was cheesy, spicy, and rich."}
{"text":"This place was great. We stopped in for lunch and the word is out because the place was packed. The ice tea was great and I loved being able to chose a half sandwich and a half potato. They were both huge and I couldn't finish. I got the club sandwich and while hard to eat because of its size the ingredients were fresh and I really liked the Russian mustard. My spud was good too, I got the cheese and chicken one and it really hit the spot.

I would try to avoid this place during prime time lunch rush (12-2:00pm) as it took a while to get our food, but it was worth the wait. 
You get a free cookie when you check in!"}
{"text":"I got the Southwest Cobb and my husband got half a New Yorker and a cup of chicken dumpling soup. My salad was huge and soooo good. The lettuce was extremely fresh and green. I loved every bite of it. I had a bite of my husband's sandwich and the meat was tender and flavorful. I enjoyed his soup, but he didn't like it. He expected real dumplings, like the biscuit kind, but instead they were more like noodles. The soup was also very thick like they added a lot of cornstarch instead of creamy like I would think chicken and dumpling soup would be. Still good, just not quite what one expects. But overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The potato soup was ok but I've had much better. The bread bowl was tasteless as was the marble rye bread. The meat was ok but there was only one thin slice. Definitely NOT worth the money...or any money."}
{"text":"Not a real New York deli. A chain poor copy. Food is cookie cutter prepared so anyone could work in the kitchen. I won't be back"}
{"text":"LOVE McAlister's Deli!  I've been to this newer location several times already since opening, and they never cease to please the palate!  Service is way fast (order at counter, then they bring food to your table), the food (mostly gourmet sandwiches, soups, salads) is excellent, the staff courteous, and the interior decor gorgeous and very spacious and clean.  Prices are good too.  I have pretty much given up on the national sit-down chain restaurants because they are often crowded on weekends, and pricey.  But I find McAlister's very affordable.  This has become one of my 'go to' places (along with mom & pop owned diners) for quick, affordable, quality food."}
{"text":"First time here and the Italian. Sandwich was great. Also had the potato salad also great. Staff was friendly and restaurant was very clean. I will definitely return to try some other menu items. It was hard to choose, they all looked good."}
{"text":"THis is the 2nd mcalister's I have gone to and the service and food are consistently good. I had a great italian style sandwich and some blackberry lemonade that was delicious. THe staff was super friendly and down to earth. THanks guys!"}
{"text":"In looking for a place for lunch, my wife and I were in the mood for Chinese. We found Blue Mango on Yelp and decided to give it a shot. However, when we walked in we found it to be more upscale than we were seeking. 

We noticed McAlister's next door and decided that it would work for us. The restaurant's ambiance is quite nice. Everything was bright and felt clean. 

Like most delis, the menu is on a board behind the counter. We found aspects of it to be a bit confusing. We decided to split an Italian sandwich and a side of mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was warm, at best. However, the sandwich was excellent. We ordered iced tea. It was $2 and was huge.

The price was reasonable and the menu varied enough that we would definitely eat there again when in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered my favorite \"hot pastrami on Rye\" and a hot tea!  Server \"we don't have hot tea\". Ok then just the sandwich.  I sit down waiting for my order and the manager brings me a hot tea from Star Bucks!  That's service!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my cousin/sister always fun to have girl time. I had Ruben and garden salad great after coming off being sick it's the best. There food is reasonable and absolutely the best food in town. Light and not to filling where you feel sick lol"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new by our home for a Sunday lunch and I am sad to say that I will never be going back to this place ever again. I ordered a Southwest Cobb salad and it was more of a cheese salad, I have never seen so much shredded cheese in my life, the lettuce was wilted and had Guacamole that I am certain came from a bag. This place is everything I hate with corporate restaurants, pretty much just manufactured food that taste like crap. I'll be sticking with restaurants that take pride in what they serve."}
{"text":"Great deli near PV mall tucked away in shopping center. Prices are very reasonable - I love the \"choose 2\" with lots of salad, sandwich and potato options. Service was quick and all the staff were friendly. Would choose this over paradise, Panera or similar place any day!"}
{"text":"First time eating at McAlister's Deli and it is delicious!  My husband said \"this is our new favorite place\"!"}
{"text":"I love this location! The staff are very friendly and our orders are always accurate. Our food is ready very quickly too even when they're busy. My favorite things to order are their spuds, veggie club, and sweet chipotle chicken sandwich. Also, their sweet tea is amazing!!!! I alway order it half sweet and unsweet and it's the perfect sweetness for me. My only complaint about all McAlister's is that they have a weird smell to them. It kind of smells like dirty mop water to me. The location always looks clean, but just smells weird. I wish it could have either a more neutral/no smell or a clean scent."}
{"text":"just ate here for the first time in about a year. workers were super friendly and we got our food really fast! only downside was most of the tables that weren't occupied were not clean. went outside to the patio to find a clean table and most of those were dirty as well. otherwise great service and a good lunch!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, not memorable.  They said it was a chain headquartered in Mississippi.  That could explain it.  Nice staff though."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about McAlister's since I moved to Charlotte about a year ago, so I finally decided to try it out. I was very disappointed, not only was my sandwich pretty sloppy, so was the restaurant. There were flies everywhere and the booths and tables were clearly pretty well dated. I was very unimpressed. 

On the contrary, I will say that I thought that all of the employees I interacted with were extremely nice and very welcoming. I wouldn't go again, nor recommend the restaurant - but I do appreciate that the workers were friendly."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite while having my car serviced at at the Chrysler dealership. Service here was fast and polite, food was very good, and they even threw in a free cookie for me. Super nice place."}
{"text":"Miss you.  Please open another store close to where you were on Tatum.  You have excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Particularly because it's going to be expensive (airport), I'd rather just get a bunch of snacks from a news store. 

Not awful,.. just not worth the money."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to grab lunch and were happily surprised at what a variety they had on the menu. So much so, it took us a while to decide. Love that they have a pick two, so we could at least pick more than one menu item.  The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly as we tried to decide what to order.  The special Pecanberry Salad was fantastic with the strawberry dressing.  The other food was delicious and perfect portion sizes.  I am looking forward to coming back to try other menu items. Bonus that they deliver and cater."}
{"text":"This is a great deli that is run efficiently with a good selection of food choices. If you enjoy a good deli sandwich then this is a good place to stop by for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"The employees at this location are are super nice!!! The tea is awesome, never old. I love the potatoes with chilli. The potatoes go perfectly with the salads. I love the Savanah Chopped Salad. The dressing are excellent. The eating area is always clean. The restaurant is well located next to where my daughter takes music lessons."}
{"text":"My mother also says if you like a place don't go very often or you want.So I live like an hour away from the nearest McAllister's so if I get a takeaway order I usually don't get hot (my problem).So this was like my third time eating there (it was just Thursday),love their 4 chesse griller/mac&chesse.So Got home and our sandwiches were nothing like I always order (we're was tomatoe?the extra chesse that I pay extra for??).Anyway called and spoke to manager,she said she was the one who made them!!Told I could have a free sandwich next time!!Really Really!! If you screw up two meals how is it right you only offer one sandwich!!Bottom line,listen to your mama.

Contacted via Yelp about my review,said it would be made right.When I went to pick up my most recent order my sandwiches + both of my desserts were free!I think it very classy that they gave my entire order free,and makes me feel that they value my business.I am very pleased and hope to have many more meals at Mcallister's."}
{"text":"McAllister's will receive 4 stars for multiple reasons. Is it a true deli? No. But once you realize that and understand that it is simply a fast food place that serves deli sandwiches, soups and salads you come to appreciate it. In this part of town there aren't many options to eat something quick and not have it be greasy. McAllister's would not be 4 stars if surrounded by other awesome food locations (probably 3 stars then), but don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there (salads and sandwiches).

People giving this 2 stars or lower are crazy and just had the wrong expectations...."}
{"text":"The quality of product and service is top notch. I have frequented this location more than a half dozen times. I greatly appreciate the gluten free bread and the fact that I don't have to pay extra for it. The Orange Cranberry Club is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here after shopping at the nearby Charlotte Premium Outlets. We wanted to try this newer location out since our the usual McAlister's we go to was so terrible the last time we ate there.

I have to say this location was fantastic! The young woman taking our order awesome. She listened carefully especially since there was some substitutions to the sandwiches. She read the order back to make sure it was right. Our order brought out to us quickly and correct.

The interior of this location was clean and bright. The food waa fresh and tasty. I had the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant. It tasted fantastic. The only small negative was they stopped serving Sunchips, my husband's favorite. They started serving their own branded chips. But that was okay. We enjoyed our meal here and plan on returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Our experience working with mcalisters was awesome. I set up a catered lunch completely over email. I had ordered too much for my party, they recommended I order less. I appreciated the honesty. They also checked to see if I would need more vegetarian dishes, and recommended a few good dishes. They delivered and were responsive and super easy. I'll definitely have my events catered through them again. 

The food was good also, as far as cold sandwich trays go. Everybody loved the potato salad."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  The tea is great!!  The salads are great!!!  Make sure to check in on Yelp to get a free cookie."}

Thanks Cody and team

{"text":"Stopped for a double date with some friends and we enjoyed our food.

After we ate, we chatted for a bit and sipped on our drinks. As I sipped on my drink, a random waiter came to our table, asked if I wanted a refill, and when I declined, he walked away. He didn't even ask the rest of our table if they wanted drinks, enough though they were the ones who actually needed drinks. My friends and I laughed about it after, but it was definitely an unprofessional move."}
{"text":"Good value, great mix of choices and very fresh tasting! Our first time coming but will not be our last! We had soup and sandwiches and they were very good. Look forward to trying something different next time. By the way, get a giant sugar cookie, very good as well!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here last Saturday and ordered the turkey Cobb along with the country potato soup. I didn't know that it had pork in it but it had good flavor. The sandwich was excellent!! I loved the quality of the ingredients and the portion was perfect. I also ordered an Arnold Palmer but it lacked flavor. It tasted like they used unsweetened tea so I probably won't order that again. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, the staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Love the tea. As long as you get a tea during the day you can come back that same day to get a refill using same cup"}
{"text":"Excellent service and even better food. Brought my mom here for lunch and we were treated like honored guests. Great environment for catching a quick bite to eat and I would recommend to anyone. They have awesome kids meals too!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was great. Ate the whole thing (which I hardly ever do while dining). The decor was confusing."}
{"text":"My husband, kids and I just had the worst experience ever at your location.  We ordered at 12:34 and didn't get our food until 1:14.  The food we were served was stone cold, but we were too hungry and already late for an appointment to send it back.  When I inquired as to what was going on in the kitchen, the guy at the counter responded this is the busiest day we have had in awhile and walked off.  No I'm sorry.  No let me come something.  No let me get you a manager.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly workers especially Kasha and Laux.
Clean 
Had Rueben and potato salad. Servings are big so split the sandwich Loved  both
Iced tea is huge and perfecto
Glad to find this place 
After ordering they bring it out on a glass plate which was a surprise
Cookies  delicious
Lots of choices"}
{"text":"The autumn squash soup was delicious, much better than Paneras. The young manager walked around and made sure that everything was fine. This was my first time at this restaurant and I will return. The place was clean and the service was quick. I enjoyed the food.  The menu is fairly large with nice vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"The service is so great here! This location is very clean and the servers were very helpful when I was deciding on my order. I recommend this place and order the pick 2 option! A sandwich and soup goes a long way! The food was brought out quickly and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this location. Very good first impression. I know it's a chain-brand restaurant so let's hope the others will keep the status quo. 

I've never been there, but went on suggestion of my mother. I was visiting town for her health and I wanted to splurge on a nice lunch because I hadn't eaten all day. I had landed that morning and had a coffee on the plane. The cashier, young woman with curly brown hair, but professionally drawn back so to not distract, great contouring by the way. She explained the whole menu to me in less than 30 seconds and suggested I do a half sandwich and a potato. I had the Reuben, and a half-or smaller-black angus potato. Quite good. 

Now one complaint I had was the door was open from outside. But I understand why, it was a lovely 77 degree day, so the gnats were a problem but I have fast hands ha. The Reuben was delicious. The potato had the most moist and flavorful angus cut meat I've ever tasted (eat your heart out Texas Roadhouse). And we got our food out so fast. We all ate at the same time and it was a wonderful way to spend time with family I haven't seen in a long time. 

Special mention is the tea, it is unique in its own. You could have it and a cookie and it would be satisfactory, or at least I think so. Refills were never a problem as the wait staff was on point with the speed and customer service. Nobody ever waited at the counter, and from what I could see, food service times were very incredible. Food was hot and fresh. Nothing tasted old or processed. 

Thank you. 5 stars.

{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. They are pretty quick and the workers are efficient and friendly. The owner also walks around and makes sure everything is good. 

The Chicken Caesar Wrap is my favorite so far. The tortilla is such a good soft texture and I love how thin the slices of chicken is. Everything seems really fresh.

The cheddar broccoli soup is super cheddar-y and the tomato bisque soup is more like spaghetti sauce and less soupy."}
{"text":"Been there quite a few times lately. This location I much better than years past. Southwest Chicken Griller I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was lured here by their annual free ice tea day on June 21 and it really was very good ice tea, so while sipping it I started looking around and seeing people enjoying their food and since everything looked so appetizing, I decided to have lunch. Since I was born in New York, how could I resist ordering the New Yorker? It was a generous amount of warm pastrami, corned beef, swiss cheese and mustard on marble rye and a pickle on the side, and I chose cole slaw as my side dish. This sandwich brought back a lot of memories and was a lot cheaper than a ticket to my favorite deli in NYC, so I'll be returning...."}
{"text":"I hate to be a downer but...I was very underwhelmed. The menu looks good and is very extensive, and I will say that between my wife and I we only tried 2 things, so maybe we simply chose unwisely. We had the French Dip and the \"Big Nasty\" neither of which deserved more than 2 stars. The french dip was a roll that was just taken out of the bag, not toasted, heated or anything and the broth, charitably call \"au jus\" was insipid brown water that was room temp. there was quite a bit of beef but it had very little flavor. At least it was tender. The big nasty, which is really the same sandwich but served open faced with gravy poured over the whole thing, suffered from all the same problems, except that the gravy was a brown gelatinous mass that was too salty. The thing I hate is that it is obvious that it was heated in a microwave, in some spots it was piping hot, actually so steaming hot that you couldn't eat it and in other spots as close as 2 inches away it was cold. The Mac and cheese suffered from the same syndrome. If you don't want to serve hot sandwiches, then take them off the menu, don't give them a nod and then proceed to execute them poorly. Some things on other people plates looked good, others, not so much. I did see a lot of food left on plates on tables after people left, not a good sign in my book. It's a shame, this place has potential, maybe they will figure out what they are doing wrong at some point."}
{"text":"Went a couple days ago for the first time after hearing about this place from co-workers. With me being a very picky vegetarian, after looking at the menu I knew this was a place we had to go to. I got the veggie spud. The spuds are HUGE. So good. My bf got the French dip. He loved it. Definitely a place we will have to come back to."}
{"text":"The store is very busy at lunch, but there is never much of a wait.  The staff is friendly enough and work quickly to get everyone's order out.  The food is good, nothing special.  The prices are a little expensive depending on what you order.  It is very close to my job, and I will continue to come back for the quickness and convenience."}
{"text":"McAlister's is usually a quick stop, for lunch or if you're in a hurry. I was in the area and stopped by for a quick bite.  Everyone was very friendly.  There was not much of a wait at 5:30 PM. Food was good."}
{"text":"4th time I ordered the Black Cherry Salad and the 4th  time there was no cherries. I had to ask each time and was brought cranberries instead. Once I was told there isn't cherries in the salad, only on the dressing . 
This time , no cherries so I'm guessing they doubled up on the onions. ."}
{"text":"Love McAlister's Deli!  It's a nice change from the normal chain sandwich shops.  You order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  They have a range of items to pick from...salads, soups, sandwiches, or even stuffed baked potatoes. Also, I think you can make any sandwich into a wrap.  I always go with the McAlister's club, love the honey mustard dressing they put on it.  You can choose from a range of sides including chips, fresh fruit, mac n cheese, potato salad etc.  And don't forgot to get their famous iced tea! It's one of the few places I will drink sweet tea.

Great fast food alternative!"}

{"text":"Nice location, same service and food that I've had at any McCalisters. Nothing really special."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service was sub-standard.  We have ordered catering service from them three times and all three times they have messed up the order. With our latest order, they gave me a receipt for one price and charged us significantly more.  I spent 19 minutes on the phone with their manager to get it rectified and he was slow and barely polite.  We will not do business with this particular one again and recommend to all visit a different location!!"}
{"text":"Forgot my Mac and cheese in my to go order. Seemed more interested in talking with off duty employee and his friends than helping customers."}
{"text":"Trying to grab a bite in between flights.  It is just after dinner time (about 7pm).  There are five people in front of me, including a pilot and a flight attendant.

Slowest service. Slower than a turtle walking through molasses.  One guy taking orders and doing the register.  He had no cares in the world.  Was not impolite, but not polite either.  So frustrating to see since we obviously was in an airport.  The pilot ahead of me - obviously his plane wasn't going to leave without him - but mine could have.  One woman in the back making the items.  As far as I could tell she does not know how to multi task and does one item at a time, waits for it to heat up, then continues.

I do have to say that my chicken salad sandwich on a croissant wasn't half bad (once I got it and sat down to eat it).  It came with a side of potato salad and a pickle spear.

By time I left, there were seven people in line behind me."}
{"text":"I love McAlisters but today this Location was dirty and about every table in the place needed cleaned."}
{"text":"This food was good but the pricing kind of high. Service was great but I can spend the same amount or less at Paradise Bakery and not pay an arm and a leg of a BLT"}
{"text":"Better experience this time around. Good food with no errors. Friendly service. 

The one negative is the bathroom -- garbage all over the floor, a mat below the sink that looks like it's at least five years old (and half pushed up against the wall), and a sink that doesn't operate correctly. Willing to look past it and visit again thanks to consistently good food, but if you're considering it, don't expect perfection.  

Overall, worth a shot if you have never been."}
{"text":"The roast beef cheddar panini is amazing! Tried the the broccoli cheddar soup and cheesecake as well. They were great as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I believe McAlister's is known for their sweet tea but it's a sandwich and soup place like any other. I think it's a little expensive just for a turkey club, you usually end up spending about $20 and you're not really sure why. Service is always really great and the line is really quick. They have plenty of parking and they are great about keeping the place clean. It's a rather large restaurant for a sandwich place but I suppose since it is the only one in Champaign now, they have to keep it ship shape. I still prefer the taste of potbellys, but I can respect what they are trying to do here."}
{"text":"I've been eating at McAlister's for what seems like years. Always good yet I always seem to stand there staring at the menu like I can't figure out what to eat. There is a lot to choose from with hot & cold sandwiches, soups, even spuds (I like mine with chili, cheese and extra jalapenos, please). Of course their sweet tea is up there with the best of them and I'm also a fan of the large chocolate chip cookies. This particular location in Matthews is the one I frequent the most. Friendly staff! McAlister's is a great \"go to\" place when you can't decide where to go."}
{"text":"I ordered a half sandwich  half spud for dinner tonight. What a mistake. Let me describe the sandwich  first. I chose the black cherry ham. Whoever thought mixing cherry and honey mustard was a good idea should go back to culinary class. There was one very dried up, slim slice of honey ham folded on a piece of bread (not the 9 grain advertised). I think the white melted, blob was supposed to be swiss cheese. Now for the spud. I ordered it with sour cream and butter on the side. The potato was between luke warm and room temperature and just a little past tender. No amount of sour cream and butter or salt and pepper could make the sad potato taste good. Now for the good part of the meal, our food runner (a young blonde girl) was very plesant and offered to refill our drinks before we left. The counter/order taker was not in a good mood. I hope her day gets better. I think it will be a very long time before I return for a meal."}
{"text":"I would like to add, that after trying several options the past year,my fellow diners and I agree that the salad dressings are not great.  Just fair.  Still love coming here though."}
{"text":"I had a great visit today. The store was spacious, clean, and looked awesome. Service was friendly and accurate. I only ordered a side of mac and cheese and a cookie, but both tasted fantastic. That mac and cheese could give any restaurant a run for their money. I hope to come back and try other things from their menu. You can tell this restaurant is ran with pride and it definitely shows. Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"What can I say? this is like every other McAlister's in the world. The food is consistent and good but sometimes slacking salt and flavor."}
{"text":"It's McAlister's! In Tempe! 

Corporate keeps their franchises so well-maintained that anything less than 5 stars is concerning. Great service, sweeeeeeet tea and fab food is what I expect and have received at their newest AZ location (here). Sad to read that their location close to my work in North Scottsdale closed earlier this year. 

Free wifi = always a plus. Also a plus is their tea club card! After you buy 10, you get one free. Make sure to keep the punch cards handy so it's not forgotten. 

It was funny to visit the first time during their opening week as it appeared I know more about the menu than they do, but I don't put that against them since this is a rare restaurant franchise in the southwest. 

The only not great part is the cluster truck parking lot that they have to share with the other businesses."}
{"text":"Gahhhh.... the only McAlister's Deli within a relatively close drive to my work. One of only a handful in the Wild West! So sad.

But very thankful that there's even one out in Phoenix-area! I am still obsessed with getting a McAlister's sweet tea every once in awhile - it is so worth it! Tastes just like getting one back in Indiana. This store is a lot smaller in square footage than a \"normal\" McAlister's that I'm used to, but I am not surprised. 

The last few times I've visited are for lunch to-go, which despite having long lines, does not take forever! Much appreciated on their focus on quick customer service during those peak hours. I've barely had to a chance to sip on tea before my name is called and I'm out the door with my salad. I cannot rave on enough about their food! My go-to are the Savannah Salad [minus tomatoes & dressing on the side] and their pressed sandwiches. It's always hard to pick which one, or even get the pick 2 combo. 

Glad to see that despite being far away from their HQ, everything I'd expect out of a McAlister's Deli is still amazing."}
{"text":"I always get the sweet chipotle chicken grilled sandwich - love it. Staff is so helpful, cheerful and great. The baked potato spuds are AWESOME. This is one of my regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"It's a rarity to find me outside Yelping during the week because of work, but I came in for dinner as I had an appointment in the area. 

Location & Aesthetics - located in Glendale next to Coldstone Creamery and Joanns, behind Starbucks. 
Plentiful parking. The restaurant has opportunities to dine inside or outside.  Very well lit and clean.  Tables weren't dirty. 
Lots of comfortable seating inside.  Ambiance was nice - decorated walls and soft country music playing. 

Service/menus - menu was comfortably placed and easy to read plus lots of menus to take away. 
Menus self-explanatory though could be overwhelming to find things.  Staff was friendly and answered any questions I had. 
Wait time for the order to be brought to the table was short. 

Food - ordered the New Yorker and was thoroughly pleased with it.  The rye bread was lightly toasted, not hard, not too dry.  The sandwich was stacked high with pastrami and corned beef which was well cooked for me. It lacked enough mustard and Swiss cheese for me comparing to what I'm accustomed to from the East coast (-1). 
The sandwich comes with a side of your choice and a pickle.
I went with the coleslaw which was very creamy, not runny, and tasted fresh. 
Also ordered the sweet tea which comes in different flavors and went with the peach.  The tea was lightly sweetened, not overpowering, not watery, however my only gripe is that it came only in one size which was large (-1).

Despite the -2 in stars, I think I'll be back as I like the variety in their menu and the cleanliness of the restaurant as compared to Panera, of course, the taste of their food."}
{"text":"The place has great food but it's smaller than the other McAllister's I've been to. The service is on thier game and the whole restaurant is always clean too. I'd love to return here soon and keep giving them some of my business."}
{"text":"Would have given 0, but not an option. Ordered a large order for about 12 people, website asks for names on each order. When the order arrived not one box was labeled with a name or sandwich name, so therefore nobody new who's was who's. And, I didn't even get my order at all. Not happy with this AT ALL!! Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot. People were nice, food was great and fair priced - but best of all, I was in and out within 20 minutes during lunch hour. I had the big nasty and broccoli and cheddar soup, both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food & service. Half & half soup sandwich option is a great way to go. Outside tables are a good option on a nice day as well. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I tried the BLT+A (avocado) and it was better than any sandwich I've had from McAlister's before. The employees were friendly and helpful. If you order tea, you may want to ask for extra ice. I find they typically give you about 4 ice cubes for 30+ ounces of tea, so I always have to ask for more.  

Expect to wait a bit here. It appears they do quite the online/pickup business, and it seems the in-restaurant customers feel the negative effects of this. After ordering at the counter, we waited 18 minutes before our food was brought out. There were only 4 other parties in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while, but I used to frequent this place twice a week. Standards have hit the gutter! Employees and management used to be friendly and the food was good. On this last visit I was treated rudely by the cashier and the manager was just staring at me watching it happen. They were busy, but I watched two employees not help another employe because they were busy staring into space. WHAT HAPPENED HERE! They used to be the friendliest place around. The food was okay, but the service turned me off. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"We went here new years eve and it was so good! The two girls behind the counter were AWESOME and took the time to explain the menu and offered lots of suggestions on the best items to order. I ordered the French dip with a side of macaroni and cheese and the sweet tea.
The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. We paid $15 for two sandwiches with sides and our two large glasses of water plus my tea.
We were checked on multiple times during our meal and the customer service is definitely one of the many reasons we'll return.
Definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Located next to the steps near Uncle Maddio's Pizza is the new McAlister's Deli location in the CLT.  Having heard they had opened about a week ago, I decided to try this location.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), I ventured to the restaurant on McAlister's National Free Tea Day.  The place was slam; but I do love McAlister's tea.  Therefore, the subliminal advertising worked as here I was on National Free Tea Day!  

Atmosphere - Crazy/ Busy, Inviting, Small, Narrow, Felt more like the inside of a Potbelly Sandwich Shop than any of the McAlister's Delis I have been to in the past.

Service - Friendly (greeted quickly and politely at the entrance and asked if I would like a Free Tea), Helpful (told that if I ordered using the website or app I could bypass some of the line)

Food - This location appears to have the full menu of the standalone locations.  With that, I ordered my regular Grilled Chicken or as they call it one of their \"Classic Sandwiches\".  This sandwich comes with grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss, and honey mustard, all on a toasted croissant with a pickle on the side.  I ordered mine without Swiss and a side of fruit.  After I got back to my desk and opened the box, the sandwich looked a little smashed.  When I started to eat the sandwich I noticed that the normal (from what I recall) single / whole chicken breast was replaced by sliced chicken (typical in a salad with chicken added).  While I still enjoyed my sandwich, it was just too messy.  I chalk this up to them either running out of whole chicken (I ordered after 1PM) or a change by McAlister's Deli.  

The side of fruit was decent in combination and taste, but lacked in quantity.  The iced tea was awesome as always.    

Overall - National Free Day was probably not the best day for judging this location.  However, despite the hectic crowd, the staff here remained calm and friendly which was definitely a positive for this location.  Since it's so close to my office and I do like their chicken sandwich on the croissant I am sure I'll be back and hopefully with an improved experience."}
{"text":"This place is great! Both their people and their food are top notch. I ordered their \"Choose 2\" option to get half a French Dip sandwich and the Broccoli Cheddar soup based on their recommendation. They were both absolutely scrumptious, I just wish the portions were slightly larger for the (still reasonable) price. Their white chocolate cookie is also on point! 

I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"In my previous review, I mentioned we have tried several different options and all have been outstanding!!! Today I ordered the French dip and I was extremely happy with the quality of the Angus beef!!! EXCELLENT quality beef!! I ordered it with pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and it was a fantastic choice!! The roll was soft yet crispy on the outside!! The au jus had super good flavor!! I'm adding this to the MANY other sandwiches I mentioned in my previous review that are worthy of ordering again!!

HELLO!! Their kid's meals are ONLY 99 cents for dine in!! It includes your choice of about 8 different selections and you chose apple sauce or a FULL sized bag of chips and a bag of cookies for ONLY 99 cents!!! 

Drink choices are delicious and unique!! Service is friendly, attentive and quick!! This is a place on our regular rotation!!!"}
{"text":"I eat in this location  more often than others as it's close to work. I go at off peak time as I like the quiet.  
Often when I arrive several tables are dirty & have dirty dishes with leftover food & drinks.  Still there when I leave 30-40 minuets later.  
Staff NEVER offers me a refill or check if I need anything.  I interrupt my meal to go to counter & wait my turn.  Other locations check in with me 1-2 times.  
Today the bathroom floor was littered with paper towels & trash can was overflowing.  NO tissue in bathroom stall I went in.  
Needs MUCH improvement!  Is anyone in charge??"}
{"text":"First time my husband has been to McAlister s, absolutely enjoyed it. Staff was very friendly and made sure we were satisfied with our lunch.food is always awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. They menu looks fantastic. I tired the horseradish Cheeder beef and it was fantastic. The menu makes me want to go and to ever item. Only complaint is I think the sandwiches should have more meat. All in all though, great food, great iced teas and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Zero communication. I get that you're slammed (slammed for this McAlister's is like two to-go orders waiting) but if you don't even acknowledge I'm there, I don't know if I need to let you know...

Also, the to-go girl took our and didn't even look to see if our food was ready so we had to take it upon ourselves to figure it out and ask for it. Ridiculous. 

We will only be coming when the day shift manage is working from now on. He's got his stuff together unlike the ladies working tonight."}
{"text":"McAlister's gets a 5 when you order their Reuben. Consistency every time!   Casual and friendly.  I don't think you can get a better Reuben for the price.  The side selection is awesome and it also comes with a 1/4 deli pickle.  My favorite is the potato salad.  Note:  They have no problem adding coleslaw on the sandwich with the sauerkraut - I think its better that way.  I've gotten other sandwiches here and if I was rating on those I'd drop it to a 4 personally, stick to the Reuben if its your first visit!  They added cheesecake  to the menu recently - it's pretty good (enough for 2 to wrap up a meal) and it comes in under $5."}
{"text":"Kellie was our cashier and she was absolutely awesome! Totally changed the environment of your average sandwich shop to a special place that makes it a mission to satisfy you. First time here and definitely won't be the last! I let her surprise me with the flavor shot in my lemonade and DON'T REGRET IT!"}
{"text":"I want to give them a one star.  Ordered the French dip and pot roast sandwich.... Both lacking in appearance as well as substance.  Service was good and everyone was very friendly.... So I give them two stars.  Mcalisters would be disappointed in this effort!"}
{"text":"I was very much desiring a sandwich the first time I went to McAlisters. I called around to find a deli that offered gluten free bread and found them. WOW! There sandwich was delicious and they are happy/willing to customize the sandwich how ever desired. I do wish they had more options for the side for gluten free, such a fritos, otherwise I continue to get the apple sauce which I am usually to full for so it becomes a snack for another day. I will continue to return and I love how close they are to my house. I wish I had discovered them sooner."}
{"text":"McAlisters is a great spot for picking up dinner on the way home. The people that work there are pretty friendly and they always have a good amount of staff working. There is a lot of seating available if you choose to dine in. 

They do a good job of making the food. They use good ingredients and make it fresh. I usually go with the pick two option and get half a sandwich and a loaded spud. It's a good amount of food. Easy to pick up but still nice to dine in. 

It's in a nice area and has various other stores surrounding it."}
{"text":"this place is revolting at best. The only reason I can imagine people giving it good ratings is because it's cheap. My 4 year old wouldn't even eat her food (and I got her 2 options cause it was so cheap.\" It's corporate food done badly. Blah!"}
{"text":"I ate there on 11/19/2012 because I was in the area, and the store had deli in its name. I ordered the New Yorker, and combo sandwich of corned beef, pastrami and cheese on toasted rye. If they called this a New Yorker in NYC, they would be laughed at and/or fined for false advertising. The sandwich was small, maybe 5 oz. of meat and cheese. The rye bread was typical Midwest soft, and the meat was tasteless. I paid $9.81 for the sandwich, chips, and iced tea. Never again."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit. The place was very busy, but the lines moved quickly and the food was brought out promptly. The staff was very friendly, the place was very clean. There were lots of choices. Hubby had the horseradish beef and cheddar and thought it was pretty good, but felt his mac and cheese was a little bland. I had the club and it was flavorful but the bacon was hard to find. Can you really ever have enough bacon? I tried the sweet tea because it was \"world-famous\", and it was very good not too sweet so that your mouth is sticky afterwards but not that you had to grab another packet of sugar to make it sweeter. The portion sizes were plentiful, and we would stop here again."}
{"text":"OK - For some reason I just can't find something on the menu at McAlister's that really makes me want to come back. I like the restaurant's setting, the people are nice, the menu has all kinds of stuff but I just haven't found anything on the menu that makes my car turn automatically when I see the McAlister's Deli sign. 

I say, give it a try, you may find something...I'll keep eating away at it and re-post if I find the mother load!"}
{"text":"Went today on lunch break, service was fast and friendly. The cashier didn't get annoyed with my \"special\" requests. I was provided service with a smile and my food was fresh. The only issue my spud didn't have enough cheese."}
{"text":"The equivalent of a Panera Bread, Au Pain or Atlanta Bread Company. Nothing particularly great or awful. They herd you in and out. The food is filling in a high-carb kind of way but not fulfilling in a savory way.

It's basically a fast-food deli. It is NOT an authentic deli IMHO by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Rating is based solely on cleanliness. Every time I visit the restrooms are completely disgusting. It looks like they haven't been cleaned in years. Makes me wonder what there back end prep area looks like."}
{"text":"The chicken Caesar wrap was way to pricey to be this dry and bland! Love the tea but overall underwhelmed ! Terrible price for what you get. And Way to slow!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new deli on the northwest side off 83rd and Bell (next to Subway and Coldstone). The service is great although you can tell that this may be the cashier girl's first job (she is very nervous - but sweet and helpful nonetheless). I tried the French Dip and it was very good. Their Tomato Bisque is above average. Their famous McAlister's Sweet Tea is very good. A bit pricey at $13 for a sandwich, soup and drink. I would still return for the great service and delicious sandwiches. Can't wait to try their French Onion soup!"}
{"text":"I didnt know a grilled cheese sandwich could taste so good! The employees went above and beyond with their customer service! The restaurant has a nice amount of seating and the atmosphere is clean and much quieter than paradise bakery! I will definitely be back! (The southern sweet tea is worth mentioning too if i may say so myself)"}
{"text":"I don't love McAlister's Menu really. I never can find anything that excites me....  I would love for them to publish the calories on their menu.... because i'm sure everything is unhealthy there.. In fact, let's go to the nutrition facts shall we?
http://www.mcalistersdeli.com/nutrition/

WHAT?!  The Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap is 780 CALORIES. HELLO +++lbs!!
... Applesauce 100 calories.. whew.... at least I didn't do mac-cheese (320 cal)

FYI - Watch out for the McAlister's Club... 1010 cal!! WOAHHHHH BUDDY.

NEE-NAW... NEE-NAW... Oh wait, that's the artery police.

However, the inside of this location was huge and parking plentiful. And the service was great! Very quick and courteous.

Sorry McAlister's ... Way too Rich for my blood. and by Rich, I don't mean Nene's rich with the trump check. More like with the lbs++++

PS - their sweet tea is BOMB. probably diet bombing too.

TEARS."}
{"text":"Woof.. the worker I encountered definitely hate her job.  She didn't want to be there or talk to me... she told me the total and that they dont have ketchup and thats about it.  The breakfast wrap was sparse in ingredients and took 5 minutes to make.  It was probably the thickness of a golf ball.  Plenty of other options, I'll find somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I've waited for years for a true delicatessen to open in this area, and while McAlister's isn't a complete delicatessen,  the food reminds me of one. 

The variety of sandwiches, the hot entrees, the wonderful salads and the lemonade or tea make this an excellent lunch spot during the week or a quick but satisfying dinner when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I really like the veggie stuffed baked potato... Cheese, broccoli, black olives, etc. Very tasty. 

Caesar salad is kind of blah in my opinion. 

Staff is friendly. I definitely recommend ordering ahead of time and picking it up because it does take them awhile to put the orders together.

Would I return? Absolutely."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I like to go here occasionally for lunch. The parking situation is pretty bad, but we can usually manage to find a spot (usually in the Burger King parking lot... sorry). Service is pretty fast and efficient. Food is OK (not spectacular), but a little pricey for what you get. Some favorites: club sandwich, potato salad, spuds, most of the soups, iced tea. The patio is nice (and covered) when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Good place for a sandwich or salad. We always get take out on nights when we just don't feel like cooking. Baked potatoes are huge (actually 2 potatoes per order), so hope you're hungry! Usually not busy at dinner time."}
{"text":"Great employees at this location & great sandwiches that never look sloppy. I enjoy stopping in here because the employees are usually friendly and doesn't take long."}
{"text":"I just moved up the street, had a coupon and figured I'd give McAlisters a shot. Here are my thoughts:
Pros: Dine in food prepped quickly. Good strong iced tea. Nice new, clean dining area.

Cons: The menu is very hard to read (very small type) albeit extensive. I had the half veggie sandwich and the half SW Cobb. The sandwich was blah, but overwhelmed by green bell pepper which I picked off. The salad was nothing special either. The chicken tasted like microwave grocery store bagged chicken. I picked most of it off, it was so rubbery. The dressings came on the side, which I appreciate, but neither was memorable.

Bottom line, without a coupon, I don't think it is worth it, but may give it a 2nd chance and try a spud. Til then, I'll stick with Cafe Zupas up the street."}
{"text":"Solid deli option in chain restaurant land. Was in town for business and wanted to try something new for lunch. Dropped in here and tried the Horseradish Roast Beef & Cheddar sandwich. 

Solid grilled panini. The roast beef was very tender, not gristly at all. The sauce had great flavor to it. Would definitely recommend to you. 

Service was also great for a casual dining joint. Will be back here to try a few other things on their menu while on my business trip."}
{"text":"I work at a McAlisters so I know how the employee are supposed to act and the 2 young men who closed on April 15 were horrible, I wasn't greeted when I walked in, the cashier was rude and looked very uninterested in doing his job, I waited for almost 15 minuets to receive my food and it was at around 8 so my food shouldn't have taken so long to be made and served, and I had to remind the cashier to give me my drinks. Everything about this location was unprofessional! Maybe it was just a bad night or day but it shouldn't matter you should treat your customers the same all day."}
{"text":"New place in our neighborhood. Went to try it out and was pleased. It has nice seating areas and everything we tried we liked. We will go back. Better than Paradise Bakery which has gotten sort of old."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with friends. It was my first time. The sweet green tea was really good. I got the Italian chopped salad with the ham and cheese toastee sandwich. It was really good. Lots of meat on sandwich and the salad was delicious, crisp and fresh with chopped up ham, cheeses, Italian sweet peppers, tomato's and cucumber. Large portions and free refills on tea. You can also get a food and tea punch card to save up for a free meal or drink. Lots of good food to choose from. I will be coming back, for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like McAlister's. They have a good cherry lemonade. I also like their iced tea. My mom and I have split the club and a roast beef. Both were very good. Clean, good customer service. I wish there was one on Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch you can dine indoors or outside I recommend the chicken tortilla soup its very good and the service isn't bad either"}
{"text":"So happy there is finally a McAlister's in the Cleveland area. The service was quick and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok the portions are ok, prices a bit high for the portion sizes. I would say though if I only order a cup of soup why should I have to wait like 10 minutes to get it at a table. That seems a bit crazy."}
{"text":"A nice place for a bite to eat. Its like so fast food.  I had the you pick two combo. the one thing I will say is it ads up fast. Lunch for two with an upgraded cup to a bowl of soup was 28.00"}
{"text":"Reuben sandwich came cold to me. For $11, it was disappointing. Potato salad was good, but I won't be returning. Don't waist your time or money here."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot. I always get the choose two with ultimate nachos and some type of sandwich. I really like tree cookies as well. Lemonade to drink every time as well."}
{"text":"Always love this place. Get the choose 2 which is great. Tried there new sandwich today and it was delicious. I believe it was the Cuban."}
{"text":"I love Macalister's deli. I always order the choose 2 and a lemonade. There lemonade is by far one of my favorites. I got the ultimate nachos and a sandwich. Both where great.  Today the service was a little slow but food was perfect and I ordered a cookie to start so all was good. I will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Great teas
Excellent service; constantly checking in to make sure everything is good. 
Really good food. 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Visited today and the food  and staff was great as always. The half sandwich/soup/salad/spud combination is my favorite.  The staff was very helpful and busy roaming around checking on the seated customers.  Always a nice place to eat.  They have a good variety of choices.  And the best sweet tea of anybody. It's real tasting southern tea, not that fake stuff m places serve."}
{"text":"Greeted warmly and served quickly, I was shocked because it was \"Tea Day\" where patrons received free tea all day. Was surprised how quickly our food arrived given the festivities. 

Hubby had his usual: chicken Caesar salad. I tried the Memphian: ham, roast beef, cheese, mustard, lettuce and tomatoes. Both lunches were tasty. 

Despite mixed reviews, I would return to the location. No issues for us!"}
{"text":"We love it here, long story short. They've got a delicious selection, location and layout. Even with the younger crowd as staff, they get the job done and really pay attention to customer service."}
{"text":"I am a fan!  I enjoy a selection at lunch and appreciate the options of half & half.  I am a huge fan soups and sandwiches. If you like to enjoy half & half, here are a few selections I have tried:  Chicken Tortilla soup, delicious with a subtle kick, and the Grilled Chicken Spud.  So good.  Another great option, the Cheddar Potato Soup and French Dip.  Both options were delicious! I do wish they would tweak their Vegetable Soup, absolutely no flavor.  
Overall the service is great, the atmosphere is inviting!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but I enjoyed my 1/2 club and broccoli cheese soup. Although I thought the soup was good, I missed the broccoli florets, like Panera...sorry."}
{"text":"McAlister's Deli has now opened in Uptown Charlotte, in the old Sbarro's location.  It has been opened for several weeks, but the line has been too long for me to check it out.  However, yesterday, I was able to get away early and was there just before 11:30, just before the line started to grow.

The menu includes items similar to other McAlister's locations, however, the space is limited and the ordering process can be confusing, as there are multiple lines with very little space to see where you are supposed to go.  This location has less than 10 tables and several stools along the wall, so prepare to get there early, if you would like to eat there, or know this is a Lunch To Go spot.

I chose the 'You Pick Two', ordering a 1/2 Club and a cup of Tortilla Soup. The tortilla soup was good, but definitely lacked the kick that I like.  As for the sandwich, a lot of meat and was very good, although the bread was a little stale.
I am glad to see there is another sandwich spot in uptown, however, not sure how often I will be able to enjoy it, due to the lines, and honestly I think there are better spots in the area."}
{"text":"Although a frequent another McAlister's, this is my 1st time at this location and the service was extremely disappointing. And, after receiving such bad service at the counter I got the wrong sandwich, ugh..And, after waiting almost 30 minutes. Yes, it was noon, but seriously. 30 minutes for a cup of soup and 1/2 sandwich. Crazy!
I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, which was good, I got three tortilla chips on the side. I asked some extra chips and was told I needed to pay $1.00.  Seriously? First off, I have always received more than three chips at the other McAlisters and to be charged $1.00 for something that should have been included with my soup, so sorry. I will definitely not rush back to this McAlister's location."}
{"text":"Wife is from Texas and she Loves this place, she was so excited to go to the one they had opened in Tempe. After placing our order we waited for about 20 min the manager comes by and says he is filling an order for 40 sandwiches and it will be awhile before we would get our order. I walked back over to the register and explained they should of said that before we placed our order so we could decide to wait or leave. Manager seemed more concerned with completing the 40 sandwiches than the customers in the store . Another group was also upset and they got up and left. They kept taking order for customers and were not relaying this information as I was trying to get my refund to leave. I was not the only customer that left this afternoon. What a fail, will not come back here."}
{"text":"My family was dying for some soup and sandwiches. First place I think of is this one. Great soup. Reliable, consistent, very tasty. Their sandwiches are always good, although the bread can be a bit soggy at times. I love their spuds. I got a veggie spud...then cheated and added chicken. I wish there had been chunks of chicken instead of slices, but the taste was great. I loved the cheese sauce - perfect addition for an otherwise dry potato (I don't use butter or sour cream). Could've used a few more pieces of broccoli too, but tasty regardless. Great fare, especially on an unseasonably cool night. Thanks McAlister's!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and our food was tasty. The place is really clean and open. Great place to stop in if you're in a hurry and want a good sandwich."}
{"text":"McCalister's is a fast casual spot where they bring food to your table and bus it afterward. The menu has lots of options and the style is American sandwich/deli. There are lots of hot sandwich options, good sides, and other hearty foods.

Namely, the \"spud\" selection is impressive. Order a baked potato and you will receive the largest baked potato you've ever seen. There are different options for potato flavors or dishes. For example we ordered a loaded potato with chili and cheese, and it was more than one of us could eat on our own. 

I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was very tasty I ordered Mac and cheese as the side and it was a good addition as well. 

Lots of seating at this location, and helpful wait staff."}
{"text":"This place has amazing service and super friendly people! There's food came out extremely quick and delicious! There ice tea has to be one of my favorite ever! Thanks loux for today! Great guy!!!"}
{"text":"Remembering the days when I would get McAlister's over in Texas when I used to live there. I got the sweet tea and the McAlister's club. It came with baked chips and a pickle. Yum! The pickle was fresh and this club was so yummy. The ingredients tasted really fresh and I love the honey mustard. Its sweetness complemented the sandwich very well. The staff were also so friendly!"}
{"text":"Says they close at 10:30 but ran out of food at 9:55. Stupid employees just wanted to go home."}
{"text":"The staff are always pleasant when I visit this location.  I love to stop in for a sandwich (chicken salad is a favorite) and, of course, a slice of their delicious carrot cake.  The cake makes me smile every time!  I enjoy the food at Mcalister's as it is the same at each location, thus making it easy to get a favorite meal anywhere you go.  No issues experienced but then I tend to visit before the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I do love McAlister's Deli especially because everyone can get what their heart desires whether hot or cold.  The kids enjoy this restaurant as well.  I always enjoy the toasted chicken salad on whole wheat.  After knocking that off, we have to make room for the absolutely, positively, delicious carrot cake!  This is the real deal.  I don't care where it came from, it is the real thing.  The three of us shared one slice.  It's a good thing because I would have eaten the whole thing!  This location is convenient and there's plenty of seating - weekdays are more forgiving with the crowds.  I plan to stop by just for coffee and dessert one evening (can hardly wait).  

So, you say why not 5 stars?  Well, the ladies' room was not up to standards so I am deducting one star for that important factor."}
{"text":"We were excited to run across McAlister's to get something to eat.  You know how it is; when you don't want to see a fast-food restaurant!  My order for the family included a Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap (wonderful) and a Grilled Chicken Club (fabulous), along with two kids meals.  We had sides of fruit and potato salad (both were delicious).  I will pass on the lemonade on my next visit and try their famous iced tea (did not taste).  I am from the North and I don't get why I should try to sweeten cold tea...  McAlister's is a great option for when you just want something to eat and you have no idea what you want.  You will find something great at this restaurant.  Service was great and the wait was relatively short. We all left very happy!  Did I mention the carrot cake?!  It is the real deal and it was DELICIOUS!  Check out my photo."}
{"text":"This was the first time I actually ate at McAlisters and I'm not sure why because I really enjoyed it. I got the pick two with half the Savannah Chopped Salad & half the Spud Max.. Both were delicious and together very filling. The salad was fresh, crisp, & flavorful and the potato was hot, cooked prefect, & loaded. It's a great luck spot & I will be back to try some other things on the menu.
The cashier was very friendly & offered me suggests one being the salad I ordered. The manager named Angel was in the front greeting customers as she was helping her staff & answering calls. It's always great seeing a productive and helpful manager. The ladies in the lobby were very friendly while cleaning the tables, asking if we would like refills, and taking up our trays. Overall this is a great clean location with a great staff."}
{"text":"Good service and reasonable prices for online ordering through the McAlisters app!  I have used the app to order 3 or 4 times now. Usually the meal comes out to be under $10... a good deal for uptown lunch prices!

When you order online you can select a time in advance to pick up. Their process is to check in with the person who will finish the check out (payment already made online). 

Have seen a few comments about not receiving plastic ware or napkins. But that hasn't happened to me so far. Download the app and give it a go!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and staff!  They seem like the happiest people in the world, and it always makes us happy to go in and eat there.

I guess my favorite thing is their maximum stuffed potato, but a close second is the Reuben sandwich which no one can arrival. It is the best Reuben I've ever had in my life. 

They keep the restaurant immaculately clean which is a major plus because I'm kind of a germaphobe! If you've read any of my other comments, you'll realize that I am very big on sanitation. So far in my life I've had food poisoning, violent cases of it, and I don't wish to ever have it again. So that is why I am very picky about the cleanliness of restaurants that I eat out at."}
{"text":"I don't know what to choose so pick two works for me soup and potato sprouts  the broccoli soup is good. The restaurant are busy but my food get on table fast and hot .good spot to stop"}
{"text":"I came here with my niece for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon after getting Manicures and Pedicures at across the parking lot. You pay first, take a number, seat yourself and they bring your food to you. Our waitress was nice and attentive. I ordered the Ruben. It just wasn't the best Ruben in my opinion. It satisfied my hunger, but that's just about it. On a separate occasion my niece did bring me take out and it was the club. Usually with a sandwich as whole I prefer the Ruben over the club, but in this case the club won. Its was actually the king club with double the meat, double the cheese, everything was on point with this sandwich. However when a deli can't nail my favorite sandwich it leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. Will I return?  Absolutely but it will be for the king club."}
{"text":"As with every other McAlister's I've been to, this one was great.  Very clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  the menu is extensive offering a large variety of  salads, soups, sandwiches, paninis, baked potatoes, and other deli favorites.  

Try the Club or French Dip and you can't beat an Arnold Palmer from McAlister's!
 (Hint: If you are very hungry the French Dip can be ordered as foot long for a couple bucks more)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and love it!!! I've found my go to sandwich shop. Yum! I've had the muffuletta (1/4) and the New Yorker & the spud. So good!! The Mac and cheese isn't great but I make my own and mines way better, so I'm partial. 

Otherwise I love this place and their sweet tea is great too.

Customer service is wonderful and the place stays pretty busy, they should open another location. :)"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I came here as we wanted something healthier (we were eating like crap for at least a couple days prior). Coming from the East Coast, I never even knew this chain existed. Anyway, this place looked and reminded me of a Panera Bread. We ordered a Savannah salad, a croissant tuna salad sandwich, and a peach iced tea. Food was not bad at all - clean and fresh, but nothing amazing. Doesn't quite stand out from other similar places. I'd come here again if I was in the area, but I would prefer to try other similar places first."}
{"text":"So I stepped out of the box and decided to try something other than Panera today (close proximity to where I like to study) and went to McAlister's.

What a total let down.... I ordered the half and half combo - half meat chili / half chef salad. 

The salad wasn't SO bad, but really? And the balsamic dressing was of poor quality - used my lemon wedge from my water to dress the salad. 

But what really brought everything around me crumbling down was the chili. Or better yet salt and old meat cup-o-crap. God I still can't get the taste of old cheap ground beef flavor out of my mouth... Hey McAlister Deli, Neveda called... they'd like their salt flat back!!! 

It's suppose to be a freaking deli... maybe call Kitchen Impossible or Gordon Ramsey for a wake up call... or hire someone that is not cheap and has a mature pallet. 

I'm sick and bloated from the food and salt... thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and they were very busy. Surprisingly, we ordered and had our food much faster than I expected. The New Yorker (Pastrami, Corned Beef, Swiss and Spicy Brown) was better than I expected. 

My partner had a BLT, which she seemed to really enjoy. The price wasn't terrible for what you got. All in all, I'd eat here again. The menu was diverse and I could probably eat there once a week for 6 months and have something different each time..."}
{"text":"Two stars for the cookie!  The kids grilled cheese which is pretty simple to make was not even toasted nor was the cheese melted? It's called a toastie cheese?  Tuna wasn't even mixed well w mayo..  The marbled rye was good.  The ingredients are fresh, for a sandwich shop I'd stick with salads!!"}
{"text":"Wooooooo Hoooooooo! So happy that McAlisters if FINALLY in Arizona. On our way now! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a McAlister's in about ten years, and while I don't remember liking it very much, they have changed a bit.  I've been to this location twice and enjoyed it both times.  Tonight I got the choose two with a bacon spud and grilled roast beef sandwich.  Both were great!  I would get them again.  Fast, friendly, and cheap.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"McAlister's Deli has some pretty darn good potato soup, I must say. So I ordered a cup of that along with a french dip. This one is different than most because they use sharp cheddar cheese instead of provolone. The bread was great though, just crunchy enough but soft enough to take a god bite. I have also had their southwest turkey melt, ummmm guacamole! That along with the soup are my two favorite things here."}
{"text":"I love shopping But I always get hungry and this McAlisters is my go to . It's delicious and so many healthy choices and the staff are fast and kind. My favorite is a choose two club and chili !"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place - when in doubt, go to McAlister's! The food is always top notch and of all the things I've tried, I've never eaten anything I didn't like. The Savannah Chopped Salad is a favorite as well as the Four Cheese Griller. The spuds are great ( huge) so I get it as the Choose 2 combo with a salad and half a spud and it's a perfect lunch. The service is always good and it's nice to be greeted as a regular. Oh, and the fresh, baked-daily cookies? A fabulous way to cap off lunch."}
{"text":"We usually get Heidi's, but it was closed on this particular day so I searched for something similar and found McAlister's and decided to give it a go. We got 4 sandwiches to-go, and all of us were highly disappointed. The bread was very dry and a bit stale, I would compare it to subway bread in the taste, texture & thickness. One sandwich had just a smallest dollop of cherry spread on it just in the very center of the bread, it was supposed to be a turkey & cherry sandwich. It was mostly spinach leaves piled on with hardly any sauce. All 4 of them had very little sauce, I had to pull out mayonnaise from my fridge and add it onto mine because it was so dry. The meat was nothing special at all, hardly flavorful. The sandwiches themselves were also not big at all and looked NOTHING like the pictures. We paid $10 a sandwich. Way, WAY overpriced for both the quality & quantity you pay for."}
{"text":"I really liked the environment of this place. It felt more like a sit down restaurant than a deli. The menu made it difficult for me to order-too many yummy choices!!!! Next time I hope to try the potato dish, but I'll have to bring a friend because it looks more like a meal than a side and I want my sandwich too!"}
{"text":"Why am i just now seeing they opened this new location of Mcalisters next to one of my favorite pizza spots Mods pizza. The employees working at this location are super nice and mannerable most of the employees working here appeared to be super young. I'm not going to lie i usually always go to Mcalisters for one thing and thats the ginormous spud! It's pretty much an over sized custom baked potatoe and they are so good. Today i had the grilled chicken spud.One of my favorite ones on the menu! You can customize the spud to your likeing if you are not a fan of the ones on the menu. Alot of customers i notice order the veggie spud or they will  order a spud and add their own toppings they like or love! Its all your choice and i love it .You have to go check out these super spuds!!"}
{"text":"So glad I moved to Fort Mill and my new northern friends suggested this place. Not only do you need warm and friendly help, the food is so fresh and amazingly tasty. No frozen or fridge yesterday leftovers either. 
The salads pecan is a special return favorite and she gets Savannah Chopped Salad. 
I also had to try the carrot cake which is so out of this world fresh and yes, I don't say this very often, is better than
Mine!  Would love to know were they get it but so good, fresh and not overly filled with unnecessary ingredients. Definitely needed another slice for later tonight mmmmm
Try this place once you too will get hooked!"}
{"text":"So first time experience was very good. Ordered a roast beef with cheddar and horseradish with the side of Mac and cheese. 
Bread was soft and fresh and roast beef was amazingly soft no need for a knife to cut through. Sweet ice tea was nice. 

The staff was very good, nice, friendly Nd helpful. 

My only thought that the cheese was not spot on didn't even feel like there was any. Also the horseradish didn't have the kick I was expecting. 

The Mac and cheese seemed fresh Home made and good but seemed to be missing flavor too. The cheese was ok nothing to send me jumping over the moon for. Maybe sharper cheese or breadcrumbs/topping to give it a extra kick to put it over the top. 

I love the WOW factor when I spend
$$$. Definitely will go back and TRY other items to see if this will be a regular to go to spot."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Had the loaded Spud and a Ice tea.  The potato had obviously been warmed up in a microwave and still was only lukewarm.  Price with tax was nearly ten dollars. Mediocre food and way overpriced IMHO."}
{"text":"I often order from McAlister's Deli for our office lunches.  I am a big fan of getting the baked potato bar and the large salad for our gang.  It offers a great variety, tasty food and it is very reasonably priced.  Another plus is the free delivery for orders over $100.  I also like that they set up the buffet when they drop it off.
McAllister's Deli makes me look good when I order office lunches."}
{"text":"My family moved here from Indy a few years ago and this was our favorite casual restaurant.  I was so happy when they opened up at ASU, as its only 15 min from my house. The best tea around (and I love tea)! They have a great selection of food, from sandwiches, soups, potatoes and salads. Portions are generous and entrees always taste fresh and flavorful! I love a fresh salad, and they have fantastic ones! Their grilled chicken salad is probably my favorite,  with the savory sherry shallot dressing.  Plus, one of the best things going for this place is the staff. Every single staff member is awesome. So friendly. Just a tip, download the app to get rewards like a free tea. They used to have tea punch cards and stuff, but now you have to download the app to get things like that (I do like the punchcards better, with a family of 4, the punchcards got us rewards faster)."}
{"text":"when one bites into any meat sandwich, you expect not to be pulling bones out at every bite.  same goes for items that have pits in them.  i had the mufaletta sandwich which had olive type salad spread.  well, you wouldn't expect to be pulling out olive pits from about every bite.  before eating the sandwich, i expected more \"POW' from it.  As for my wife, she had the tuna sandwich and said she gets a better tuna sandwich from sprouts.  which actually has flavor in it."}
{"text":"So I have very mixed feelings about this Mcalisters location in the Overstreet Mall.  On one hand, they provide a quick, casual option for lunch, but on the other hand, the space occupy is very tiny and I think they are playing the volume game here in serving the Uptown lunch crowd.

Since this location is well within the Overstreet Mall, it's really only accessible via foot.  If I had to drive and find parking to wait in a large line, this would never be on my lunch \"go-to\" list.  Once you get there and depending on the time, the line can snake... I mean snake out the door.  It's not as bad as the Chick-fil-a line... but I think this line does not tend to move quite as fast as the well-oiled machine that have farm animals encouraging you to eat more chicken.

If you dine in... and I usually do, because I don't want to bring my food back to my depressing cubicle and stare at the screen that I will be staring at for the majority of my work-day.  There maybe me 6, four top tables and one large round table for a tight squeeze of 6 people.  They also have \"bar seating\" shoved up against the wall.  My last experience, I got stuck in the corner and it was awkward getting in and out.  Luckily the nice ladies sitting next to me were nice enough (or they saw the puppy dog look on my face) and helped me in and out.

Typical Mcalisters menu here, but this is where I start to think they are geared for \"grab and go\" since I usually get chili in a bread bowl \"FOR HERE\"..... the first time I got it, it arrived and was in a \"build your own lunch\" format.  Bread bowl wrapped in saran wrap, chili in a separate sealed container.  OKAY it took like 30 seconds to take the plastic off and pour the chili into the bowl, but I felt like I was making my own lunch.  Small thing, but it is just not very \"come in and have lunch with us\"... it's more like, \"grab your ish and go back from whence you came.\"

Other than that... it definitely fills a need in the Overstreet Mall.  I usually walk by and there is a line and a LOT of people waiting on food.  I'd be interested to see just how much business they push out in a day."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to order some take-out lunch to eat at home.  We beat the lunch rush, but like most McAlister's, this location handles rushes pretty well.  Our order (being a \"big\" one for 5 people and a small child) was correct and the person taking our order was very patient with us as 5 people trying to decide what to eat on a giant menu of items is daunting.

This location is tucked in Blakeney and the parking lot is not my favorite to navigate, but still pretty manageable.  This spot is very busy during the weekend, but I'm sure attracts a good crowd during the week days.

Since we didn't dine in, I can't speak much about the dining room, but it looked to be in order.  The staff was busy busing tables for the turn-over lunch crowd.  Probably my biggest gripe is that there is a small outdoor bench to sit on while waiting for your order to be prepared.  You don't really wait that long, but if there is more than one family waiting for an order, you will be standing up for sure."}
{"text":"Sorry McAlister's.... we were lucky enough to not have to wait in a terribly long line, but the food came out like there was only one person in the kitchen.  I ordered a SALAD... and it took a long while for it to come out.  Normally I try to be a patient person, but it's a salad.  Prepared items tossed into a bowl....

It just didn't seem that there was a sense of urgency even from the registers as you could see the lunch rush coming in.... 

I am hoping it was just a lot of people calling in sick or something... but I may try to avoid this location for a while.  Luckily there is a closer McAlister's to my office that makes a \"fairly quick\" salad."}
{"text":"Good place with a lot of options for lunch.  You can even customize your sandwich here if you aren't feeling up to their many sandwich options.

I think all McAlister's feel a bit the same... you get \"herded\" to the back of the location to a bank of registers to order.  The staff at most of these locations are pretty friendly and helpful... sometimes you feel a little rushed if the line is starting to build and they try to get you through.  You are given a number to place on the table and the bring out the food to you nice a hot/fresh.

This location offers free wi-fi but I haven't brought my computer to test it out yet.  I've seen people working or meeting with laptops here.

The thing I HATE about this location in the university area is the parking lot.  It is impossible to get in and out easily and the spaces are all for compact cars, which makes for some interesting parking lot stories and near misses."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service in a nice shopping center with plenty of other stores around so it makes for a good place to stop and take a break from all the shopping or the Costco sampling across the street.

This location is tucked into the shopping center so it is a little hard to see from the main street.  The parking lot can be crowded at times so pick your battles.  Personally I don't mind walking especially after eating a decent meal, but that's just me."}
{"text":"This place has been so desolate every time I've been here. The food is not the best either. They have a ton of menu options which is really the best part. The cookie was good too, but overall, nothing special."}
{"text":"The rudest two female workers in Tempe, very rude to customers they acted like they had a late Friday night and working Saturday was a struggle for them at least put on a fake smile"}
{"text":"McAlisters has a very traditional local diner atmosphere.  I stick to salads when I go and they're always really tasty and made with quality ingredients.  Friends who I go with really dig their soups and sandwiches.  My friend who introduced me to this place swears by their sandwiches.  If you're looking for frills, this ain't what you want.  But if you just want good deli food in a low-key environment this is your place."}
{"text":"So many good lunch choices at McAlister's. They have a great assortment of menu items from soups to sandwiches to fresh salads to spuds. I had the southwest Cobb that came with a generous amount of guacamole. Delicious. I got mine to go and I only had to wait a few minutes after ordering. Servers were friendly. Check in for your free cookie!"}
{"text":"In Arizona 3 separate occasions since May. In Arizona for kids baseball tournys.  Ate here every time we came out. Best deli I've been to in awhile.  Fresh meats bread. Definitely be back when I return.  I'm from California"}
{"text":"Great service, always friendly. I've had 2 sandwiches there thus far; the Frenchman dip and the big nasty. Both of which were very good, the big nasty isn't a traditional open faxed sandwich though."}
{"text":"Very good French Dip sandwich and Savannah salad for my wife and I (though the sandwich would benefit from a shmeer of horse radish). I expect that at McAlister's. But what we loved was their follow-up. On at least three occasions we were checked on by different staffers. That's better attention than we've received at much more expensive restaurants. 

Definitely on our list for return visits. We also appreciate the consistency between different locations."}
{"text":"Nice deli, great service food is okay. Cookies were yummy."}
{"text":"Went with my MIL for lunch on a Wednesday as soon as they opened at 11. Only 2 other tables occupied. I ordered the new Parmesan Kale soup. Mother in Law ordered 1/2 Club and 1/2 Italian Chopped salad. 

Only took about 10 minutes to get our food. Soup arrived piping hot and extremely tasty. A little on salty side from the cheese but would definitely order again. It was my MIL's first time and she loved it. Her sandwich and salad perfection to her eyes and taste buds.

The iced tea and service here is amazing. 

We were surprised the place was still pretty empty when we left an hour later unlike the Paradise Valley location which is always packed. McAlister's is a keeper on our lunch rotation.

Don't forget to Yelp check in to get your free cookie."}
{"text":"So my first time here! I wasn't really feeling lunch but met a friend so I had to order something. I opted for the Chicken Tortilla soup in a bread bowl and a peach tea. My dining companion had the Choose 2. Her choices were the Chef Salad and the California Turkey Reuben.

When our food arrived it looked great. Soup, salad and sandwich appeared to have quality ingredients and the person that prepared it took a little pride in their work.

So why only 4 star? This is totally personal preference. I wouldn't have necessarily called my soup Chicken Tortilla. All of the tortilla soups I have encountered have tortillas sprinkled on top. This did not. And it is usually a flavorful broth with diced chicken and avocado. This was more like a thick stew. Don't get me wrong, I ate it, all of it along with the soggy inside of the bowl, it was quite tasty, it just wasn't what I was expecting. To me if was more like a Southwest Chicken or a Chicken Enchilada. The peach tea was great and they offer free refills which I gladly accepted when leaving. If I was in the PV Mall area and needed a drink I would make a special stop for the tea.

My friends salad looked great and with the half sandwich it's more food than one person could eat.

I forgot to check in or I would have gotten a free cookie, but my companion had a receipt survey from a prior visit and she got the white chocolate macadamia nut. It was 5 star.

Service was great, everyone friendly and accommodating. Dining area and rest rooms clean.

McAlister's is definitely a keeper on my lunch rotation. And I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"A great place for a healthy & quick lunch.
Ben and I stopped in before my flight from the CLT to DCA.

We each had the 1/2 and 1/2. I had the cobb salad with the turkey reuben.
Everything was fresh and great flavour at reasonable price...overall a great value."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to the Highland Creek area. It will do but customer service isn't their strongest asset. I've visited multiple times where the associates decided to have a conversation as oppose to helping those waiting in line. 

However, I've not been disappointed with my Southwest Cobb salad to date."}
{"text":"Slow service today.  Bring a jacket, it's always cold in here.  Tables are dirty today.  WiFi is slow. Pick two from the menu is the way to go.  Chef salad and bacon spud (dry today)"}
{"text":"Pretty good and solid choice near marketplace. The prices aren't bad and the selection is pretty decent. The only problem is that not all items are consistently good."}
