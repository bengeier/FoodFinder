{"text":"Given that there are 3 Greek restaurants along Prince Arthur within a stones throw of each other, I almost skipped this place thinking it was another Greek restaurant.  After checking the menu, it turns out this is a Portuguese grill restaurant.  I tried the grilled trout.  Note the absence of adjective fillet.  This is an entire grilled fish entree.  It comes with grilled vegetables and rice.  This dish is big enough for 2."}
{"text":"Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. 

I ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.

I'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped."}
