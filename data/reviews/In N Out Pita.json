{"text":"Just had the chicken shawarma. Tasted great and decently priced. Im glad they don't charge for each topping like some other places. Definitely will xome back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, average tasting. Nothing special. This place is kinda pricey for no reason. The fries were really good though! So I recommend that. However, there are so many middle eastern places that serve better food for lower prices. Don't go here unless you got $$$$ to spend."}
{"text":"The chicken schwarma is delicious. The fries are freshly cut and cant be beat. If you are feeling gutsy order a schwarma poutine for the most delicious combination of cheese, gravy, fresh cut fries, and chicken schwarma for less than $10. Great pig out spot"}
{"text":"This shop was hard to find but then finding a shawarma shop in richmond hill is like panning for gold in the Yukon - good luck with that.  The place is clean, the staff were very friendly, the price is reasonable and the shawarma was good. I like that the meat was moist, and fresh. It's not outstanding but the shawarma was good, I'd definitely recommend it to all my shawarma lovin' peeps out there, we have to stick together and spread the word of where to find good shops (unless you want to poison yourself with McDonalds...).   I will return to this place when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I moved to Richmond hill a year ago and could not find a place to get a good shawarma a friend recommended in and out pita so I tried it and well I loved it the food here is great fast food nothing too fancy its great I would love more meat in the shawarma though :p"}
{"text":"In N Out Pita is by far one of the best spots in Richmond Hill to grab some great chicken shawarma. The owners are great and their food is always fresh and consistent. They also serve many other traditional dishes."}
{"text":"I had the shawarma plate and the gyro and everything was as expected. Neither disappointed nor impressed. The food and service was ok. I found that best thing about this place is the very good dining space with a couple of very ample sized booths (great for those with kids).   If I am in the mood for shawarma and I am in the area, I don't see why I woudnt come back here."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots, I hear a lot about the shawarma they have here but personally I have fallen in love with their philly steak and cheese sandwich. One of my favourite sandwiches ever. You have to try."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Richmond Hill last July, I have driven or walked past this little place every day on the way to work.  It's tucked away in the Richmond Heights Plaza right next to Subway. Never did I think this little place would serve some of the best Shawarma I've ever had.   Friday night I went after work because the day before the BF was in town and decided to try this place out for lunch while waiting for me to get in from work.  I walked into my apartment and was immediately welcomed by the smell of lamb. Drool. Wait, cruel. Where's mine?  Of course, once I mention the smell he goes on and on about how delicious his lamb burger was and how I have to try it some time. Thanks! I will and I won't bring any home for you either.    I walked in with intention of ordering the lamb burger but once I saw Shawarma I had to have it.  Since I was starved and ate lettuce for lunch, I decided to order the Shawarma plate. They didn't have a lot of chicken left, so I got both lamb and chicken. Sweet! The plate came with basmati rice, spicy potatoes, tabbouleh and coleslaw.  I was amazed with the amount of food and all for just 10 bucks. I had enough for two meals.   When I got home I was determined to eat as much as possible but I decided to split it so I could enjoy it again.  Oh, and I made sure to take a photo of the plate and send it to the BF.  In your face, I just had Shawarma!  Honestly, I love these kinds of places. The ones that shock the crap out of you.  I know it's clich√©, but never judge a book by its cover, and I definitely did. Think of all the Shawarmas I could have eaten by now.  Such a shame.   My next trip will be with the BF, should always share the love, that's why we Yelp this stuff! Plus, they have a 2 for 1 Shawarma special.  A $10 dinner for two is hard to find and this food is conversation worthy.   Cheers,   Tiff"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Sharwarma and gyros and this is not the place for it. It wasn't bad but it wasn't especially good and unique. This place is typical of a family restaurant, very causally decorated, nothing special. But what matters should be the food.   I ordered the lamb and beef gyros. It wasn't what I expected. Nothing was special about it, tasted like something that I would make myself. The meat portion was small which didn't balance out with the taste of the toppings. After finishing it I was still a little hungry and had to eat again once I got home.  For good shawarma and gyros nothing beats downtown when you don't make good stuff you go out of business!  Food 2.1/5 Service 3.5/5 Ambiance 2/5 Value 3/5  =========  Overall 2.3/5"}
{"text":"I have been having my own quest for perfect shawarma recently  Came here to try out their shawarma sandwich. I noticed that they have shawarma poutine on the menu so I had to try that out! Chicken is great here. Fries were thick and fresh. Portions are generous. Wonderful, very friendly.  Don't think shawarma and poutine should mix? well A) you are wrong and B) check out their shawarma pita or plates instead, meat sure is tasty here and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've seen the sign for this place on the street like 3 times a day for the past year, so I had to stop by once.  Came here on Friday night after going grocery shopping next door, NO FRILLS REPRESENT YO.  It's a pretty small place, right next door to a starbucks and a subway in a pretty desolate strip mall just south of Elgin Mills.  But as soon as we walked in, we were greeted warmly by the owners working the cash.   It took us a few minutes, but finally, we ordered 3 chicken shawarmas and 1 gyro.  Sadly, the owner informed us that since he was closed ten minutes ago (it was 9.15pm) that he only had enough chicken for 1 shawarma, but lots n lots of beef. So I switched it up. Got 2 beef, 1 chicen and 1 gyro.   All for the lovely price of 20 bucks, 22 with tax. WTF SO CHEAP.  We took them home to go, and 15 mins later we were chowing down.  I mostly got a gyro because my momsies had never heard of one before, and asked me about 10 times what one was while we were there. Mostly I got it to keep her quiet lolz.  Anyways, the chicken shawarma WAS FREAKING FANTASTIC. It reminded me ALOT of the for real real shawarmas that one would get on the streets of dubai, and if you've been to a place called AL Mallah in dubai..the chicken comes REALLY close in taste (only dubai peeps will know what im saying)  The beef was really good too, I was surprised. I usually don't find beef shawarmas done well here, as I think they're overdry and oversalted. BUT this was done super well.  ALSO LOVE THE PICKLES.   The only reason why I'ved rated this 3 rather than four was because of the Gyro.  It was so bad. I can't even begin to describe how bad it tasted. I will defo go back, and just never order the gyro again.    3 stars yo"}
{"text":"I love a nice felafel sandwich  and am always on the look out for the small family owned restaurants.  You got Starbucks, Subway and In-N-Out Pita for a lunch choice at this corner of a old strip mall  After having come here with my wife for lunch who enjoyed her felafel plate I go the panic call  \"Kids want Shwarma and I got home late.....Help!\"  A quick U turn and I am in luck with dinner  A couple of Shwarmas put together the way you like them and generous chicken dinner plate and I am on my way  I had a wonderful conversation with the owner (whose name i forgot) about his family in the USA and where to get Lebanese ingredients   he makes the drive to Warden and Lawrence to get the best ingredients for his customers  now that's dedication in his craft  I told him I hated how these chains serve up bagged and processed food and the marketing teams claim as fresh.  His simple comment was that it takes extra time to get excellent ingredients and extra time for food preparation but in the end its the ONLY way he can be happy serving a great meal to his customers.  I always have my ears up for customers who come in and you can tell right off the bat that they are repeat customers and this place has that atmosphere  so a good tip is to engage your chef in conversation and let them know how much you enjoy their food as it just makes for a better dining experience even if its a take out order"}
{"text":"Had the falafel sandwich, it was good and fresh, done on the spot and not reheated which is always good.  The salads were fine but not that great.  Bottom line, good spot but not the best."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of times. The price is right, especially if you grab one of the specials they advertise on the board outside the store.   Both times the store was either empty or near empty (mind you though I was there at a time when most places would be slow). When I see an empty place I start wondering how fresh the food is going to be. No need to wonder, it was fresh every time.   On the most recent visit, I got a falafel wrap (only $5 on a special) and a two sides to go ($3 per).  The time before that, we had two chicken wraps. The chicken was juicy and flavourful.   All in all, In-and-Out offers a quality lunch option that is quick, healthy and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I would avoid this place. I got a Chicken Shawarma which was bland and not too cheap either ($13 combo). Then I suffered from stomachache."}
{"text":"Mediocre middle eastern place. They have a variety of lunch specials, but you get what you pay for. Not awful, but doesn't separate itself from the pack."}
