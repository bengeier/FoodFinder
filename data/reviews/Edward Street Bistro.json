{"text":"Made a reservation for Valentine's day on January 29th and they just called me now (Feb 11th) to cancel it saying they are doing renovations over the weekend. Really, you did not know about this before January 29th? Now I'm left scrambling finding an alternate at the last minute, really not cool folks."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Aurora.  
We dine there often.
My birthday was held there in one of the lovely rooms on the side. The menu that my husband selected was outstanding and printed for each guest. The service was superb.
We also use the deli regularly, very interesting choices including a take out dinner for two that is very reasonable and full of savoury choices."}
{"text":"A very welcome to the choices in Aurora. First of all the service was outstanding. This place has a real downtown feel about it. The other three people with me had wine and beer and the choices are varied. Somehow I always end up as the d driver and ordered a coffee, which took a long time coming. I mentioned that to our waiter and was told since it was early in the evening, he prepared a fresh pot. The wait was worth it, hot and fresh!!! I shared a peppered jumbo shrimp on a bed of grilled pineapple and horseradish. It came with 5 shrimp (we truly need a standard for what is a jumbo shrimp) and it was hard to give up the odd one. The other couple shared the house onion soup (cooked for 10 hours) and yes they were given two spoons. Both said they could have ordered the soup and had it for their main, it was that good. Had the 6 oz. tip streak, it was cooked perfectly and might have been one of the best I ever had. The vegs and home made fries
were done just right.  The others had halibut, shrimp and scallops( the shrimp were bigger than my jumbo ones) and pork. All agreed that we would be coming back. They have a market next door that offer a wide variety of already cooked items, fresh bread,etc. The only negative thing I can say (this seems to be a problem in a lot of the new restaurants in new buildings) that it was very noisy.  The ceilings are bare steel and some sort  baffling could be used?"}
{"text":"Had the special last night, 22oz rib eye with greens. It's was awesome, a great first timers experience. I'll definitely keep this in mind for future outings. Service and atmosphere was good too. Good draft beer selection."}
{"text":"I have to admit, that I was a little surprised by this place today for lunch. I was fully expecting after reading the fantastic reviews by other local yelpers that this place would blow my socks clean off. On the contrary my socks AND shoes remained firmly on as I dined here today.

Walking in to Aurora's Edward Street Bistro I must admit it is a fancy spot for business lunches and casual drinks. I'd even say the upscale decore and interesting art choices adorning the walls would put this as a fancy spot for dinner (definitely going on my list of potential date spots - provided they make some adjustments).

I feel that ones impression of a place is in the details and right off the bat we were shown to a table with a large tear in the leather of the booth. I would expect that with as many open tables as there were for our late lunch that staff would avoid seating patrons at a less than standard booth. I'm not picky but if I was running a restaurant I certainly wouldn't want people dismissing all the excellent design choices I'd made by seating them at a substandard booth. That's just me.

For our meals, I decided to order the shrimp tacos. They came served with a wasabi aioli and a corn salsa. The taste was incredible, however even as an appetizer size this was barely enough for 1 person and the price certainly did not reflect the portion size. My friend ordered the lamb burger with sweet potato fires and was very happy with his selection. Me on the other hand knew I had to order something else right away to avoid possible blindness from starvation.

I ordered the caesar salad appetizer and while the portion size was large. I have to say the caesar dressing was actually the worst I've ever had. Caesar is my fav salad and I've had every kind from a table side to a run of the mill Mcdonalds DIY Caesar.... I liked this less than the  mcDonalds. Why? Well, while the single crustini adorning the top was good, the dressing was essentially mayo. I asked my friend to verify and he too has a very acute palate and he agreed that I wasn't crazy and this was a very Mayo tasting dressing (and not fresh....like a Helmans Mayo taste). In addition the roasted red peppers slices at the bottom of my bowl did nothing for the taste.... just not really enjoyable at all.

The other item that kinda got me was the lunch time price. $60 for 2 small appetizers, a burger and 2 beers. Kinda pricey if you ask me - maybe this place is out of my league BUT I have had fine dining at lunch for less (and more to be fair). 

One of the saving graces of this place was it's solid Ontario Craft beer selection: Steam whistle Pilsner and Mill Street Organic on tap - certainly some positive points. 

I don't want to give this place a 2 star but I feel it needs improvement to achieve a 3rd and 4th. I am adding this to my \"i'll be back - second chance\" list, because I know any restaurant kitchen can have an off serving and I want to very badly believe in the reviews of other yelpers. Perhaps Lunch is not their forte, I will need to try dinner to make up my mind fully

For now I will say 2.5 star and my next visit will determine the correct bearing of my review.

 - always about second chances -

{"text":"They just cancelled our valentines reservations too. :( desperately trying to find an alternate place. 

Drove by to see that the place has been closed for \"renos\" but there's no visible work going on. Something seems not right.."}
{"text":"I really really want to love this place. It's been a regular for us for years and with the promise of new management and a menu - we got excited. Maybe too much. I had a steak - which was fine. Not $41 fine. But fine. My wife and her friends had burgers. They said it was good but the bun was stale. Which is disappointing since they have also have a bakery. They use the day olds in the resturaunt?  Didn't stay for dessert. Not sure if we'll go back. :("}
{"text":"I really like this place, we've been here on numerous occasions and the food and service are superb! Definitely quality food and the price which is slightly higher is justified bc of the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Ok, this is an update to my original review.

Went there for Mother's day dinner.  Wanted to book their brunch, however my illustrious Wife decided to run the Sporting Life 10k that day..

I'll cut to the chase.  Dinner was outstanding!

I had the 16oz porterhouse.  Cooked to a perfect medium-rare (both the tenderloin and striploin part of the porterhouse - which is a feat unto itself and shows attention to detail).  Honestly, I've been to high-end steak places all over Canada and the US, and this ranked up there with the best of them.  It was served with amazing crispy fingerling potatoes.  I want to jump head first into a Mr. Turtle pool filled with those potatoes. 

My wife had the beef short rib, which is always outstanding.  Once again, they treated my little guy to a mini grilled cheese to keep him occupied (a really nice touch).  The food came out at a perfect pace.

One thing I do want to mention is the service.  Our Server (Sarah) was the perfect balance between attentive (but not too attentive), and friendly.  Some of the best service I've had in a long time.

You know, I'm reading all I wrote above, and it sounds OVERLY positive.  But in all honesty, there isn't anything I can fault them for.  I will say that it's not the most inexpensive place around, but it's WELL worth it.  Certainly the best place in the area to eat, and one of the best in the GTA."}
{"text":"Just ok. Honestly the highlight of the meal was the Caesar salad. Nice big house made croutons and crispy prosciutto with a very nice dressing. We thought we were off to a good start, that is until entrees came. 

I had the prawns and scallops with risotto and my wife had the beef burger.  The burger was overcooked and under seasoned. Honestly the only flavor was from the toppings and condiments. The cook on the seafood on my risotto was done well, but again the whole of the plate was under seasoned and underwhelming. 

Did like the selection of Ontario craft beer though. Has a nice pint of Red Falcon from Stouffville Brewery. 

Not sure if we just had bad luck or the other reviewers are easily impressed. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I experienced two opposites when visiting Edward Street Bistro. As a starter, I had the Grilled Chicken Spinach Salad, which I enjoyed very much. The pizza (Forest Mushroom, Goat Cheese, and Arugula), however, was not that good. Their Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee was absolutely outstanding. Washrooms are very nice, and although the service was a bit slow, the whole ambiance of the restaurant was nice."}
{"text":"This is at best passable hotel dining room food, and would get 2 stars if they were not pretending to be something they're not and charging luxury prices without offering the quality.

The grilled calamari was promising, well-cooked, but the sauce fell short--too liquid, not able to cling to the seafood. Caperberries had miraculously turned into plain old capers--the first of a long substitution list for the night.

Then ordered the \"Duo of Ontario Lamb\" medium rare, supposedly a \"grilled chop, roasted sirloin, crispy chickpea fritter, Moroccan spiced jus.\"

Nothing was right about this dish. The 1\"x2\" sirloin was presented well done, gray, and dry. The falafel (yes, you can assume the Newmarket crown knows what this is without dumbing it down) was extremely dry, The chop was, as described, a single, tiny chop. The \"Moroccan jus  was not spiced, unless you consider salt a spice. The green beans were near-raw. $30 flushed down the sewer.

The Braised Short Rib was surprisingly nondescript, also missing most of its announced accompaniment--baby carrots and Brussel leaves, instead having the same raw-ish beans as the lamb.

The service was adequate, in that Olive Garden/Moxie's way, with that \"I'm just being pleasant because it's my job\" feel, topped off with the overzealous smile when the bill is dropped off. The muzak was unbearable. The table behind us sent their mains back because they hadn't gotten their appetizers yet.

I suppose we missed the dead giveaway, which should have sent us running. Above the bar, there's a chalkboard with the drink \"specials\". When we tried to order the Mexican Smoothie, we were told they didn't have it. Specials. Chalk board. How difficult is it to erase what you don't have?

We declined dessert. Aurora could do better. Much better."}
{"text":"Amazing grilled cheese and great gourmet items for a better price than in Toronto. Great selection and service!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I enjoyed our dinner there.  It was really busy when we went and I was impressed with the quality of the service even when they had full restaurant.  My one complaint would that it is quite noisey in there.  

The dinner was costly and at that price point I would prefer to be somewhere a little quieter.  I would go again but likely go on a day that was not as busy.

I had the Mahi Mahi which I enjoyed and a sweet and bitter salad.

My husband had a steak and a savoury salad with goat cheese.  He thoroughly enjoyed his salad but was not a huge fan of his steak as it was slightly over cooked and a bit tough."}
