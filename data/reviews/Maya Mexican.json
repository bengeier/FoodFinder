{"text":"Pretty much the same menu as big brother Cozemel's and still a nice place to enjoy dinner with friends. Nice staff, good Margarita's and clean place. Such an upgrade from the last place. Mexican tacos are good but i prefer El Rodeo's tres tacos more. Have not had a bad meal or time either sitting inside or on the patio. Come on down and enjoy some Parma Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food looks and tastes mediocre at best, definitely not authentic. Prices are cheap, but it shows. Service is spotty. Only good thing is that they have a large menu."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. We had a party of 10 and were the only customers. Would not bring new drinks. Took forever to get food and some people were waiting 30 minutes after half us got ours. It is also important that I have been an avid Maya consumer in Berea. I have had nothing but good experiences there. Besides the service, the food tasted horrible. The beans were cold and bland. Therefore, I would strongly recommend the Berea location, not Parma."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge fan of Mexican food, but this place is delicious.  I've been here a few times now for both lunch and dinner, and the food has always been high quality, fresh and delicious.  There's a wide variety on the menu and they give chips and salsa at both lunch and dinner!  There seems to always be a variety of specials at awesome prices. Last time in, I had to wait awhile for the check, but that's been the worst.  I highly recommend Maya's for great food!"}
{"text":"Not your typical 'goopy' Mexican food. Sat on the patio, and service was attentive. Food was very good - the refritos were some of the best I've had, and I'm from East LA. We ordered the chicken fajitas and the El Combo. Portions were huge! There was easily enough to feed four people! The chile relleno was spectacular; almost as good as mom makes. The beef taco had a great flavor, the chicken fajtas were well seasoned and the veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. As Ahnold would say, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely LOVE Mexican food, and we were so thrilled when they put a Maya's close to where we live. The first couple times we went there we thought it was a good average Mexican restaurant, however we noticed how they were not as friendly as most Mexican restaurants we enjoy. Our last experience will be our absolute last, the chips tasted like old grease, they CHARGE for extra chips and salsa brought to your table before the meal comes (if you are anything like us we love our chips and salsa to snack on), and the one waitress was very rude and brought us chips that we were OFFERED and said were \"charging you now ITS ON THE MENU\". We probably would of been oh ok thanks for letting us know if she showed some customer etiquette. I personally think if they charge for extra chips they should only refill by customers request and let them know there will be a further charge.They did not even ask to refill our drinks. That was just my personal experience and we will be enjoying our beloved Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, awesome atmosphere! I can't stop coming back! They are great with kids as well. Small quiet place."}
{"text":"Three stars is generous, in fact too generous.  I don't know what the state of Mexican food is in Cleveland, having moved years ago, but I am assuming it is not doing well considering the positive reviews of a mediocre- at best restaurant.  We walked in, and the loud obnoxious children screaming, crying, and running around, inspired us to go to the patio (not at all the restaurants fault, but bad first impression).  We sat outside, ordered a couple drinks- 16 oz bud light drafts are only $2 all the time- after finally receiving our bill however, they charged us 3.50.   After finally ordering due to the service being leisurely, we got our food in a reasonable amount of time.  The food was at best average, the chimichangas were ok.  They weren't crispy, even the spots not covered in a sauce that truely reminded me of spaghetti-O's, and they were poorly filled, on both chimi's both sides were completely empty.  My moms seafood burrito (the special) smelled like it was the last day for the imitation crab, overlooked tilapia, and decent shrimp.  The service is pretty bad- the first check in on our meals was after two of the three of us finished.  This isn't the worst food or service ever, but there's no reason to come back, Taco Bell is closer, and the quality is higher.  Highly recommend if you want a bud light though.  Also, I've done this entire review after the plates were cleared and we asked for the check, in addition to the table next to us getting up twice to see if anyone was going to serve them, and again for refills after no one came out.  Good luck guys, you need it."}
{"text":"Our family went for dinner tonight. Never again. We asked to be seated outside. They for got about us.  Fifteen minutes later they took our order. We also ordered 2 beer specials for $2.  They gave us $3.95 ones instead. They never checked on us until we finished and never refilled our waters. We then waited over 10 minutes for our check. Food was fair. Could of had more meat. Rice was good but the beans were terrible."}
{"text":"After seeing the decent reviews on Yelp for Maya we decided to go here on Friday night for date night.  The restaurant is right near West Pleasant Valley, so it actually is by a pretty busy side street.  That makes sitting outside to eat not as pleasant, but still the option was nice.  The actual inside was small but cozy.  Maybe 10 tables tops.  Everyone there was Spanish, and spoke Spanish...  Which to me and my husband was a good sign.  The service was good and the food selection was nice.  Slightly disappointed that the meals didn't come with both rice and beans...  But with how good the appetizer chips and salsa were, I'm not complaining.  My husband got the chimichangas.  He said they were very moist and that the red sauce was delicious.  I got the El Originale burrito.  It was good, but keep it mind they do put a lot of red sauce on the burrito.  So I actually had to scrape off quite a bit before I found the thing palettable.    Overall, a great place to try out.  Probably one of the best places we have found in Northern Ohio for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Salsa is mediocre, but some might like crap salsa. The queso and cheese dip is watered down. If you order it to go you won't get much chips. I'm from the south where you can find some of the better Mexican food. This is spam quality food on a silver plate. They gave us a taco salad with barely any lettuce. It looks like mush. The tacos were edible and decent. Take my advice and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Place is really small and we felt really cramped. The bathroom was right there by all of the tables and people were eating dinner two feet away from the bathroom door. There should be at least a barrier or something. It was just a weird placement to me. The food was just okay. Nothing bad, but nothing great. There wasn't really any thing on the menu that you can't get at any of the other similar Mexican restaurants in the area. The food came to our table really fast though which was good. As for the service from our waiter, it was nonexistent. Our waiter took our order and then we didn't see him again until he dropped the check on our table and walked away. We didn't get a single refill or any thing. I don't feel like I should have to flag down my waiter just to get a drink. We wanted dessert, but we didn't want to have to wait another hour to get someone's attention and then another hour just to get a new check. We were there for over two hours and got one glass of water and some mediocre burritos. It was really just the slow or lack of service that we received that ruined this experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were passing through and stopped here for lunch on a Saturday. The food was excellent. I tried a lunch combination and my girlfriend had the Chori Pollo. Both were wonderful, I  recommend giving them a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Parma Mexican.  Pretty much says it all.  I've had better Mexican at a mall.  Okay, maybe not, but it was damn close.  My wife and I ordered two of their margaritas, which are quite large (and $8.50 apiece).  I couldn't even drink mine.  You know those urinal cakes that used to be popular in places like bowling alleys in the 70's?  It tasted like that smell.  The lowest garbage mixer off the shelf and...well, my wife drank about a third of hers and said there wasn't even a whiff of alcohol, so I won't say anything about the low grade tequila; I figure there wasn't any.  I ordered the shrimp quesadilla.  That is, once our group finally got the chance to order, which was quite a while (weeknight, not many people there).  Once the food came (and it was fairly quick), a bunch of waitrons arrived and started shouting the names of entrees at our group in ridiculously heavy accented English, which none of us could understand.  So, much shouting over and over ensued, with the wait staff getting more and more basic with their descriptions until someone claimed a dish.  And hey, I'm not dissing people who speak English as a second language here, but if you're not gonna remember who ordered what, you're gonna have to speak a little slowly if you want the customers to help you figure things out.  My order came and looked pretty good, except, well, it wasn't a quesadilla.  It was a shrimp stir fry with a tiny bit of cheese laying in a folded over burrito shell.  There was no way to eat it other than just flip up the limp burrito shell and eat the inside with a fork.  Which might have been fine, had it had any flavor.  Thinking maybe it was me, I forked a mouthful of shrimp, onion and green pepper into my wife's mouth and watched as her eyes got big.  \"No flavor!\" she agreed.  How do you REMOVE the flavor from shrimp, onion and green peppers?!?  The shrimp seemed like it was cooked well...it just tasted like...nothing.  My wife got a mole dish and said it was just okay.  I asked the waiter to remove my untouched-except-for-one-small-pull-on-the-straw margarita from the bill and told him it was the worst margarita I'd ever tasted.  He acted like I'd just told him I was the Pope.  So...food: awful.  Service...substandard.  Prices...not bad for the food (except the food sucked, so what's that worth?), but the liquor was ridiculous.  There are lots of better Mexican places on the west side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Watch your bill, they charge doubles for single drinks.  And when you question it they don't make a full adjustment to the bill.  Food was good this time but normally it is not very good.      We even called to ask about what prices should have been ($5.50....charged  $8.95, then only removed $1.00)...Told manager on phone and he could have cared less that we were ripped off."}
{"text":"If you order your food for take out you had better take the time to check what's in the bag. I ordered steak tacos, and they gave me beef. Yet charged me for steak. Okay fine, I realize that I fucked up by not checking my order. Fuck me for putting a little bit of faith into a person that might be able to write down whether someone is eating beef or steak. ANYWAY! Now it's time to just make due with my beef tacos. Not going to mince words here....the beef looked like shit. Why I even put this wretched abomination in my mouth...I couldn't tell you. Not since I was 4 years old and ate dirt have I made such a bad decision to put something in my mouth. So now we are in trouble for dinner, right? Right. Time to try to fall back on the only other things we have. Beans and rice. Hooray. Doesn't exactly make you lick your lips and rub your tummy in a cartoonish satisfactory kind of way, does it? It was fine. That's why this place gets two stars. One for beans, and one for rice. Yay beans and rice. Now if you sit down at this establishment you are bound to get better treatment. It's not so much fun to fuck someone over when they are sitting there and tips are involved. I would rather just take the extra drive to Cozumel. They have a better staff there. Sure the employees there look like they want to kill you, but at least they get the fucking order right."}
{"text":"I had the pollo con creama, it was delicious! I would definitely go here again. The server was very nice and extremely helpful. The margaritas here are also very good."}
{"text":"Meh.  Came because my coupon said $.99 taco Monday.  When I asked I was told that was a mistake but they never offered me anything as an apology. I stopped coming here several years ago but was told they changed hands and was better.   Not. Bland salsa, runny food.  Too bad, it could be so much more."}
{"text":"Normal, good Mexican food. The portions are good also. It's definitely not expensive either.  It's a nice place to go in winter because it has a Nice decor - bright and cheerful which every Clevelander needs in winter! Also a nice summer spot with their little patio.  Good margaritas too :)"}
{"text":"Awful!!!! Place was empty but the waitress was too busy on her phone to get refills or even check to see if the order was right which it wasn't. No refill, no check up, wrong order means I can not emphasize enough how disappointed I was and I warn ppl to avoid!!"}
{"text":"If you live within a few miles, it's slightly better than Taco Bell. Otherwise, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Mehhhhh at best. The salsa was pretty bland. The queso was okay. They charged $5.00 for a plate of beans and rice. There's definitely better in the area."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Quality is lacking as food tastes v.ery avg. Been disappointed multiple times....basically sucks. Watch your bil bc they've tried pulling funny stuff with charges"}
