{"text":"Terrible service. Ok food. The servers have a lot of attitude and the food is mediocre at best. Also the wait times for food are ridiculous. One has to experience too much attitude for food that doesn't warrant a return. I doubt this place will last into next year if their service continues this way. Probably the second time in my life where I didn't leave any tip. Not going back...even if they offer free food."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.
Authentic recipes, flavored with original spices and a touch of class. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Where should I begin. This is the worst experience, organization, customer service, treatment I have ever experienced. 

I would give negative stars but yelp allows a minimum of one

In ramadan they have a buffet service. I called before yesterday (May 19) to book for the same day, the guy told me to go on their website and book there. When I did go on their website that date was fully booked. So the next day (May 20) I booked earlier for that day and I found a reservation for a table for 3 and got a confirmation message. 

The maghrib prayer (sunset) was at 8:42. I arrived at the restuarant at 8:50 and it was so crowded and messy. The lady at the entrance asked what was the name under the reservation, I told her my name and she proceeded to look through a piece of paper with hand written names. I told her I booked online. She said \"Oh sorry online reservation is a problem\" (please remember that the guy at the restaurant was the one who told me to book online)
So I said that is not my problem I have a reservation for three people and a confirmation message. Then when they couldn't find an answer for me the guy next to her said \"Well you came after 8:45 so we gave your table to someone else who just walked in\", I told them there is no where in the confirmation message or anywhere stated that 8:45 rule. Again, no decent reply and they just shifted their concentration else where.
 Meanwhile, my mum had low blood sugar and was sick and had to sit down so she stepped outside. It was a few minutes we're waiting and they basically told us to go look for somewhere else to eat. I am pregnant and hungry and had some other reservation that I cancelled for this one and had no other place to eat.
I asked them where is the manager and went and told him we had a reservation, first thing he says \"look when you came,  what time is it now?\" It was 8:59 and regardless what time it is I am not his employee on duty, I can come whenever the hell I want and I was only 8 minutes past sunset time!! As I started arguing, my sister comes to me and tells me that the lady found us a table so I go back to her (but I check on my mum first cause she stepped outside to puke from how tired she felt) and asked her about the table she's like it's not there anymore I told your sister but you weren't here (this was roughly two minutes after my sister tells me about the table) I told her you knew I was going to the manager inside, she said \"I thought you sorted things out with him\", really cause we base scenarios on what our thoughts now!! 
She starts talking while I'm talking and shouting at me saying that I just wanna cause problems. I mean who hires people like that with zero experience in customer service and haven't got even the basic moral to speak to people appropriately. 

THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS PART ABOUT THIS WHOLE THINGS, is I know mistakes can happen in reservations but there was no apology for the inconvience caused and they tried to make it OUR FAULT and had no decency to admit their reservation system is clearly flawed.  It took us around 40 minutes to find another place to eat. One thing I'm happy about is that I didn't pay a cent in a place like this."}
{"text":"TLDR: I wasn't particularly impressed, nor was I particularly disgusted by the experience, hence 3-stars. My friend, who's Middle Eastern, thought it was pretty bad and way overpriced, so that's an influencing factor on my review (I usually do mine by committee with the people I'm with if they don't Yelp). 

Location: easy to find, lots of parking, ton of seating inside (probably caters to a lot of family gatherings).

Food: My friend and I got three things: Beef Kefta, Eggplant Fattah, and Spinach Manakeesh. Flavours were in general not bad. The beef was well-cooked and flavourful, but everything else on that plate was pretty bad. The grilled vegetables weren't really that firm and lacked the strong grilled marks and taste, and it was like a third of a skewer; I basically got one of every vegetable I believe. The \"french fries\" were like half-cooked thick-cut potato chunks. They were frankly a hybrid of the thickest french fries (steak fries) and just potatoes like home fries. I would say that the fattah was pretty oily; combine that with a lot of yogurt and it can wreak havoc on some people's stomachs. The manakeesh was fresh; the dough was firm and well-cooked, but the flavours on it weren't that developed. I'm not commenting in greater detail because I simply haven't had that much experience with Middle Eastern food. It was totally palatable though; no problems sleeping.

Price: woah, the prices were pretty high for some things. The Beef Kefta was $17 for somewhat mediocre food outside of the beef itself, which is ground beef, aka one of the cheaper cuts of beef. The food was not bad, but no way was that worth anything over $10. Also, who makes you pay $1.50 for water??? A ~$35 meal for two isn't that bad of a value, but also considered that that was strictly food (no drinks ordered at all), also not an everyday kind of expenditure.

Service: in general, once the food came, we didn't need any attention, so we didn't get any attention. Nobody seemed very excited to be there to be honest. Not much else to say beyond that."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. All the staff need to be fired and a new crew hired in their place. The Ramadan buffet was so disorganized. Everyone basically attacked the food table when the athan sounds. Refills came very late. Tables are arranged in a way that they crowd each other. If you intend to get up to get food you will hit the person behind you if you slide your chair back. Iftar is 8:52 yet they required us to be there at 8:15 or our reservation will be cancelled. We reserved a table for 8 but only 6 people managed to come and they wanted to charge us for 8 at the end even thou they filled the seats on OUR TABLE with two randoms. We ordered drinks but never came but off coarse the charges showed up in the bill. They should really aim tp give out less reservations and to serve less people with how many staff they have. Absolutely horrendous experience."}
{"text":"Food and value are good for price, however the staff can never seem to get the take out orders correct. Often items are missing, substituted or incorrect. While we enjoy the place and food, we plan to go to Paramount where they get can consistently prepare the orders correctly."}
{"text":"Forgot about my order. When the order finally did come out it was wrong! Waitress never asked if we needed drinks. Terrible, terrible service! Avoid this place at all costs!

Update - July 1st, 2017: Someone from this establishment reached out to me stating that they're under new management. Although I cannot personally verify this, I hope things have changed here for the better."}
{"text":"Furniture cover is torn, food came very late in spite of going in a dead time. Fatta was very bad and cold, the bread was nice.
The schnitzel portion was good, but not delicious.
There was no rice, to my astonishment i asked him how come, he told me it is still being processed. The food came after half an hour which is more than enough to get the rice done.
We ordered for arabic ice cream, after waiting for some time he told us also that it's not available.
Bad experience in a bad place."}
{"text":"Good restaurant but the atmosphere is full of Shisha's smoke and so uncomfortable for non smoking families
And kids the whole place is full of fog because of the smoke that is coming out of the Shisha. I wish they had a separate section for Shisha smokers. Other than that food is great and service is very good"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst place I've eaten at. Their over priced pretentious portions of food are to laugh at. Brought my whole family here and was blown away by the carelessness of their custom service, quality AND quantity of food (YES, all three). It was hard to communicate with the waiters who switched half way through our \"meal\". They brought more plates than food and half the table didn't get any glasses. I don't like leaving negative reviews in hopes that I can communicate the needed changes to the manager before leaving reviews however after 2 complaints, no manager came to address them. Moreover, we asked for just skewers of meat and were told that the price would be the same as the combo with fries and rice (really?). We tried paying a bill and were given an extra bill from someone else's table. This is a sad excuse for a restaurant and would keep my appetite as far away as possible from it. No wonder the restaurant keeps changing every 3 months. Horrible."}
{"text":"Just revisited AlFawal last weekend, and this was my first time trying any food at this place.
We ordered most of the appetizers on the menu as we were a big group, and their apps are all great, tasty and good portions...
The mains however are not as good as their appetizers, tried the chicken and beef scallop along with Chicken shish-tawouk, and chicken saj...they all need some major work and lack a lot of taste.

Appetizers: 4/5
Mains: 2/5"}
{"text":"His name was attracting me to try their fool, but their fool is the worst one I tried in mississauga. I think paramount is better than them.
Also, their manakish is nothing make it special than the home made one. I think Adonis manakish is better then theirs."}
