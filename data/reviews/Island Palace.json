{"text":"This is my new Caribbean spot. Absolutely the best jerk chicken you can get in the gta. Mary is a sweet heart, always happy to serve you. Try this place, you won't be disappointed and I guarantee you will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I would not come back here again. I ordered oxtail and jerk chicken. Let's start with the oxtail first. When the oxtail came it looked very delicious but when I finally tasted it it was tasteless, it had no flavour whatsoever, so I then ordered a side jerk chicken hoping that it would be better than the oxtail, it was even worst, jerk sauce was sour and the chicken taste like it wasn't cleaned properly very strong after taste. Overall experience at this restaurant was very dissapointing, probably one of the worst carribean restaurant I've had in awhile. The only thing I give them credit for is good customer service because the Asian lady was very nice other than that I would not come back ever again!. Its just an honest opinion."}
{"text":"Very sweet lady who works in the front, price was good and food was good also. They weren't cheap on the portion for the goat! , that's what I like. Will be coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I have had the chicken roti, jerk chicken with rice and peas, fried chicken,  all the soups they have (chicken foot,  beef, chicken) which all were delicious. The owner is a great guy super friendly and an amazing chef you can really taste the passion. My boyfriend and I come here often we play chess, watch some television,  and enjoy Free wifi.  I recommend this place to everyone.  So delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk pork and chicken. We returned three times in 2 weeks because we couldn't get enough. The fried chicken is great too. Crispy and juicy inside. Ox tail gravy is amazing..(you have to sing that last word) A-MA-ZING! Oh, I almost forgot to mention  the coleslaw. So sweet and smooth. Loved it."}
{"text":"I came here because of the high rating and it didn't disappoint. I had a small jerk chicken even though the large is only like $1.50 more and it was fantastic. The portion was ample and the sauce made it extremely flavourful as well. The staple rice on the side was a great side that I pretty much dumped on the chicken and had it all together. Some of the best jerk chicken I have ever had and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"They know what they're doing and they always know I want a large jerk chicken when I walk in. The owner Lawrence  is so nice and Mary is so lovely !! It's clean and spacious and an extremely calm environment with fresh food. I reccomed it to everyone. In fact I'll probably go there later today"}
{"text":"I had the jerk pork and it was very delicious.  The pork was so tender, you only needed a fork to eat with. Rice and peas was tasty and not over cook. The beef patty was nothing special, had better. The price was very reasonable and no complaints with their portion size.  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, clean seating, friendly staff. We ordered 2 dishes - Jerk pork with rice and peas + Curry goat with steamed rice. Both were absolutely delicious. I could not finish the large pork dish (too much. I should have ordered the smaller version). Staff were friendly and very helpful with regards to the questions we had about the food. This is probably the best Jamaican restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ! This has to be the best caribean places in mississauga, it brought back memories of my grandmother's cooking back home in Jamaica.  The porridge is the perfect amount of sweetness and the ackee and salt fish don't get me started on it ? It's absolutely amazing I could it eat it all day long. Good job guys !"}
{"text":"Ample seating, owners are very friendly. Their coleslaw taste amazing and I always get the plantains here."}
{"text":"5/5 on the food. I loved It

I got jerk chicken and my boyfriend got curry goat 

the lady working was so bland though. She barely made eye contact didn't smile once. 

we came in at around 850 unaware that they closed at 9 so when we sat down to eat 5 minutes into it she turned off the tv we were watching and started closing down the restaurant making it evident she wanted to leave 

But if she just explained to us when we walked in we would have taken it to go no issue

Still worth going - food is unreal !!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best jerk chicken and jerk pork that I've ever tasted. I like to go West Indian restaurants because I really enjoy the food( I'm West Indian). I've tried so many different types of jerk chicken with rice and peas, it's crazy! When I came across this spot, I fell in love with the flavour of the jerk chicken - it's making my mouth salivate just thinking about it, that's how good it is! When you order, get the large size, it's only $2 more and twice as much. The service is good also. The food is great for the price you pay and the service is alright. If you're a fan of jerk chicken, you should definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"If I were to ever order Jerk Chicken over my more favored dishes: oxtail and or curry goat, it would be from Islands. The chicken is cooked and seasoned to perfection. Tender, moist, and perfectly flavorful. The portions are always humongous, and service fast!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great quality food.  I've been to a few Jamaican restaurants and haven't had it taste like a home cooked meal.  Portions are large here and good always fresh.  

What do I like?  Question is, what don't I like!
Jerk pork, Jerk chicken, Ackee and Salt Fish, Oxtail, Fried chicken and Chicken foot soup!  Soo good!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for caribbean food in Mississauga. For some reason, many other places close too early on the weekends except for this place. Portions are very large and well price. I suggest trying the curry goat on rice, very filling."}
{"text":"Store bought jerk sauce not authentic at all few flys maybe because it was hot, lots of seating tho I would recommend Willys jus at the intersection better food and better service. The only thing I would recommend buying here is s can of coke or a drink other than that there is no real island flavours tasted in there food"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday evening ...
Pretty quiet inside not a bad start .
Ordered oxtail with rice and peas 
Got a decent portion for a fair price . 
Tasted decent ...have I had better yea. However it was pretty good for the price so no compliants
Staff was friendly and helpful ."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, place was empty and quiet. The food was just okay, nothing spectacular. We weren't asked whether we wanted to dine in and the food was served in styrofoam."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of my cousin, otherwise I would have easily passed this place by.

I ordered the Jerk Chicken and boy was it a lot of food. The rice and chicken is heavy, it was packed to the top. Great amount of spice to it and the server was friendly. Will definitely go back the next time I am in the area to try the Jerk Pork."}
{"text":"Really quiet and dimly lit atmosphere in the late afternoon struck me at first, but I decided to give lunch a try here. Ordered the jerk chicken that probably came out of a slow cooker in the back. The only staff member there was kind and seemed to know the regulars. 
Packed into a tiny box, I was worried that I had overpaid for something so small, but it really was loaded. The chicken fell off the bone; not overwhelming with spices, but with a delicious savoury flavour. The rice was nothing special to me, but the chicken definitely redeemed it. I'd go back for takeout and probably opt for a side of coleslaw."}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken with rice and peas. The chicken was not crispy at all and the rice did not have that flavour.  Service is also a little slow."}
{"text":"By far the best jerk chicken and jerk pork I've ever had. No exaggeration. 

The chicken is perfected to the tee. 
Crispy on the outside with just the right amount of spice and soft and juicy on the inside. 

This place honestly is a gem. Cannot compare to any of the guys in Toronto (sorry) 


Not to mention the friendliest service!!!!!

Highly highly recommended. Can't go wrong here."}
