{"text":"This place is awesome!  The rolls are delicious, and the prices are reasonable.  I was in Phoenix for business and needed a place to catch a good quick lunch.  This place was perfect!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and wanted to ensure that we enjoyed our lunch.  They had refrigerated meals-to-go or you can order fresh which is what we did.  Not much seating inside, but there are plenty of tables in the shade outside.  We ordered the spicy california rolls and the philly rollys, both of which were delicious. I would definitely go back.  Of course this is right downtown, so be ready to pay for parking & keep in mind they are only open until 4p.  Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi. Way better than expected and only 5$ each for 8 pc of  Spicy Tuna , California Roll , Spicy California Roll, Vegetable Roll, California Roll Salad all day ."}
{"text":"Sushi was very tasty and I go to a lot of sushi restaurants. Food was prepared very quickly and the guy working was extremely friendly. Amazing customer service experience. I would recommend eating here and would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I Highly recommend this place. Prices are fair and they have $5 California roll always ready on their grab and go fridge."}
{"text":"Not bad. They will make you fresh rolls if you ask and  OK selection. Their grab-to-go can be slim but it doesnt take them long to make a role if there is not one out. 

If you want sushi quick and aren't picky, drop in, enjoy."}
{"text":"Enjoy Sushi is what it is - pretty decent, fast sushi.  Obviously not the most authentic, but they do have a nice variety of rolls to choose from, and it is certainly better then the pre-made stuff you can find at Costco and other such locations.  A great alternative for a healthier, yet filling, lunch."}
{"text":"Decently priced for a place to eat on the go. I have not yet had their sushi but would like to try it. I ordered the teriyaki chicken but wasn't blown away. The potstickers and egg rolls were very good though. Service was friendly and quick. Atmosphere was enticing. I will return to try their sushi."}
{"text":"Had the orange chicken lunch box and I have to say it's probably the worst orange chicken I had yet. It's drench in this \"orange\" sauce that didn't even taste like orange flavor and the crab puff wasn't even that good. It reminds me of cardboard. The pot stickers were average which is why I'm giving it a 2 stars."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it seems that the quality has slowly decreased over time at this place... I just don't ENJOY like I used to. 

I was really disappointed when I realized that the flying fish row on one of my rolls was actually some sort of \"orange flake\", made to deceive you into thinking it is something it is not.

Less about fresh, delicious fish and more about weird creamy sauces and crispy oniony things... just not my idea of what sushi should be.

Friendly staff."}
{"text":"When I first saw how small this place was, I was afraid it was going to be premade tasteless sushi.  I was pleasantly surprised.  While there is some premade sushi, it is not tasteless and I'm pressure it hasn't been sitting in the case for very long.  And the fresh made was also very good.  Add in the convenience factor with how close it is to my office and we have a winner."}
{"text":"Had a lunch combo and a grab and how sushi. Combo wasn't good but the grab and go was much better. Not bad for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Seems to be a proliferation of Asian fast food in downtown Phx, this is the latest.  A refrigerated case of freshly made rolls (most in the \"reverse\" roll style with rice and seaweed inside, fish on outside).  Quite serviceable fast food sushi, prices for most rolls are $7.99 or below and one order would make a nice light lunch.  They also have bento boxes in the $7-8 range if you are looking for something a little heartier.  Ingredients were fresh and thoughtfully presented, the flavors are a bit off of authentic Japanese but again, perfectly serviceable as a fast food lunch and it is nice to have healthy lunch options downtown.  While I was there a lady came in and said she had come all the way from the Capitol to get takeout so it appears others agree.  Very little indoor seating so plan to eat at one of the shaded picnic tables outside or when it gets hot, pick up takeout.  Only major drawback to this place is that they have only bottled drinks, perhaps due to space constraints.  Wish they would have offered fountain drinks and freshly brewed green ice tea."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of healthy food. Food seems fresh and light but with good size portions. The lunchbox specials are a good value with a drink. The sushi is handmade and very flavorful. One of the best in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place! Quick, well priced sushi and great service! I really like their Shrimp Tempura Roll, Crunchy Crab Roll and Tiger Roll."}
{"text":"Definitely the spot for a quick
Sushi lunch when you're in Downtown! The service is friendly and FAST!!! The quality is great, and the menu is easy to understand (they got pictures next to the words lol) try it:)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a quick lunch. It was authentic sushi but I was in and out and didn't get much interaction, kind of felt like a number. I would go back and give it another try though."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I came here because we heard the prices were really good. The food was good. I had a lunch special that came with two sides all for a little over 7 bucks. Great value."}
{"text":"This sushi place is perfect for downtown. The location is convenient and clean. The sushi is tasty certainly not the best, but definitely crave-able. The sushi is made fresh daily and is consistently delicious. If you work downtown and love sushi, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped here for lunch today after passing by on a multiple occasions to go elsewhere. My craving for sushi has been knocking on the back door for too long now. Luckily this place was not a disappointment!  After much debate I settled on the tuna lovers roll however because they didn't have enough tuna for the outter portion of the roll they asked me if they could also put salmon on it, which I accepted without hesitation. The roll was decently priced at 7.99 and the fish was very fresh tasting, not an ounce of fishiness. This is a great spot for a quick lunch but I wouldn't take someone out to eat here only because most of their menu contains non raw rolls and the variety of fish is very minimal (mainly tuna and salmon)."}
{"text":"Super Fresh & Delicious. So happy there is a quick, yummy Sushi place by my work. I go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. 
I came here for the lunch special on a weekday and really just wasn't blown away. The teriyaki sauce tasted more like gravy. The crab puffs were good and had a traditional sweet and sour dipping sauce which I liked. 
Best part was the grab-n-go sushi. Crab California roll was actually pretty good. I'd say stick to that and avoid the combos. 
Best little place nestled in Renaissance Square, just remember you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The sushi is so fresh and the staff is so friendly. It is a great place to pick up a quick lunch if you are in the downtown area, they have the pre made rolls ready by 11am and are made the morning of! You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"So yeah. I have been wanting to go here forever, but am never in the area when it is open or if I am I am in a hurry or forget about it. Two days ago I was on the light rail thinking about what to do for lunch when I realized it was 3 so they had buy one get one free sushi. I walked in and saw a few different rolls left in the box. I grabbed a roll and a \"mix and match\" roll box. The mix and match box was pretty good, I enjoyed it without any complaints. The other roll had cream cheese, cucumber and crab inside with salmon on top with some sort of topping on top. That roll I wasn't really a fan of... the crab inside didn't look very good, it seemed kinda gray in some parts, and its texture was rough.... maybe frozen a little bit??? idk. The salmon which is supposed to be orange was the same color as the ginger and tasted a bit off. The topping had a bit of a spicy kick to it, not sure what it was. Based on that time I probably wouldn't have came back, but I kept thinking about it and did it again yesterday. This time I got a dragon roll and some other roll since they still had them. This time both of them were great, everything tasted great. So I guess I would say that they are about average. 3 star for the sushi, but the people there are super nice, so an extra star for that. The miso soup was okay too, the guy working brought out a bowl I guess they were closing and had some left over. Wish they had some tofu in it though, it was just broth and green onions."}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place previously but I thought I'd give an update ...

The ownership/management has changed, thus the atmosphere has changed as well. The rolls and prices are still about the same, though the customization that I mentioned previously is no longer available without surcharges.  I used to love coming here and chatting with the owner and watching my sushi be made fresh before my eyes. Now, however, surcharges to avoid my food allergies has really kept me from wanting to go back.

The food is fine, the prices are fine, but this place changed. Sorry, ES, you're not the same sushi place I became enamored with initially..."}
{"text":"Initially I was going to walk over to Harumi because I've had their grab-and-go sushi a few times and it's always be very good. But it looked like rain the day I went, so I stopped at Enjoy Sushi instead. Their g-n-g selection was laughably light, but one of their mix and match boxes looked packed with terrific raw fish options. It tasted like quality, fresh fish and was varied enough that I felt I ordered each item myself. My coworkers are interested in returning for their bento boxes, and I'll update my review then."}
{"text":"I rarely do 5 star reviews but Arizona has been really impressing me in some ways. I replace a great value on getting great quality service Plus food Plus saving money and enjoy sushi was truly enjoyable after my chiropractic visits at CHS. There are premade rolls available but you can ask for anything you'd like, I even I free CRUNCHIES on the side! Any time I spend less than $10 on a meal (app + free large lemon water) with a tip, I'm a happy chomper!"}
{"text":"I am on jury duty and I have picked a different place to eat everyday. Today it was Enjoy Sushi. I probably should of known  better as it is pretty much a self serve. Fast place to get something to eat. They do make sushi trays to order or do as i did pick from a refrigerated show case. I chose a tuna roll. For the $7.99 the roll was a good proportion. No complaint over the price. I took the pre packed box and went to a nice quite place to eat. The tuna had a slight fishy taste to it. Not a good sign. Finished and for the next 3 hours I burped a fishy taste. One time is really not a good way to judge a place but I am not going back. To many other places in the area to eat."}
