{"text":"Günstiges all-you-can-eat mit einer großen Auswahl an verschiedenen japanischen Köstlichkeiten... Sushi, japanische Frühlingsrollen, gebratene Meeresfrüchte und zum Nachtisch grüner-Tee Eis... 

Für Mittags $12,99 und Abends $19,99 (?) ist das Kyoto House auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert. Vom Ambiente und dem Personal sollte allerdings nicht zu viel erwartet werden."}
{"text":"Let me start off by just saying I was going to this restaurant for dinner with my boyfriend as we were craving for sushi. But I was wrong to have chosen this restaurant because it had terrible service! For the first time I ordered from the all you can eat menu I didn't receive everything I ordered, they forgot my bowl of rice. The customer service was horrible, every time a waitress approached us it would be in rude manner. The food was not bad but not great. The sushi lacked flavour and there were only a few options to choose from the all you can eat menu. I realized this place was very unsanitary and their dishes looked unclean. What made it worst of this whole experience was the end! When I ordered for my green tea ice cream I was eating it peacefully but then I noticed a piece of hair inside! So disgusting!!! I wanted to leave right away obviously but I wasn't sure if I should mention it I was just so upset. Then a few minutes later a waitress hands me and my boyfriend our bill without even asking! She just hands us our bill as if were being forced to leave the restaurant. I find that really rude, as a customer we should be able to ask for our own bill when we are ready! The restaurant is unsanitary and the waitress are disrespectful! I'm never coming to the place again and I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was one of my first AYCE sushi places I've ever been to and I still go back quite often. Its sushi is delicious and so are their pork cutlet and chicken teriyaki. Their service isn't exactly grade A but hey, as long as the foods great, that's all that really matters to me. Often, the servers forget a couple of our orders but I don't mind since you can always order again. Other than their satisfactory service, I'd have to say their food makes up for it and I'm sure I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of choices. It's ok for lunch but it's sort of the place I only go if my friends all want to go. Otherwise I would never step place into this restaurant. The dinner menu is not worth it though."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best. Every time I've been here, I've had their All You Can Eat sushi and it wasn't my choice of restaurant. It's not really good. The rolls and sashimi are actually room temp, to warm-ish. If you've had actually good quality sushi, you'd never come back here. If anyone is looking for a good All You Can Eat sushi place, check out Fushimi on Church and Wellesley! I went there recently, and I LOVED IT- which is very different for me to say since I usually don't like sushi very much. It's a little pricier but SOOO worth it. All the items my friends and I ordered were fresh, and delicious! The sashimi is very well chilled. Anyone who eats at, and thinks Kyoto House is where it's at, I feel bad for y'all. Y'all are living a sheltered life. I'm still searching for even better sushi places downtown!"}
{"text":"The staff are rude and it is not on the cheap side. Their bentos are only available for dinner and they don't even have a vegetarian bento. When I ordered all you can eat for lunch, I got sushi that was obviously not fresh, and my order for vegetable udon came back with chicken in it.

Basically, only go here if you're starving and everywhere else is closed."}
{"text":"It's cheap and you can eat all you want plus it's very close to everything at dundas and yonge so after filling yourself with to much food you can go for drinks at shark club or catch a movie at Cineplex yonge dundas. Like most all you can eat places the food isn't great but it's good"}
{"text":"I just went there for all-you-can-eat dinner.  Excellent food, decent price for what it is.  Second time there.

Now the service seems to be polarizing in all the other reviews, and it was interesting how it was.  The first time I was there the service was hands-down excellent.  This time, however, the service started excellent with quick and accurate serving; as the night wore on, though, service became slower and less accurate, with missing and incorrect dishes showing up.

Still, enjoyed it both times, will definitely be back again and again, but I'll have to keep in mind that service is a gamble."}
{"text":"Bad service. Most of the waitress never smile. food got to the wrong table and no apologies. I have found hair abd some black threads in the food. 
Seafood are fresh.
The servers are unwelcoming"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and AVOID this place!
Maybe I am being a little harsh but I came here with the boy friend for all you can eat...lets just say BAD MISTAKE! the food from the Kitchen is the reason why I even gave this dump 1 star. The makis are so sloppily done I could have done a better job, as well the special rolls were hard to choke down (we could only eat the center and dump the rest).

All in all, WORST SUSHI PLACE EVER!!!  SAVE YOUR $$ AND GO TO MAZZ SUSHI!"}
{"text":"Affordable and decent AYCE in the area. I didn't bother writing a review until I had AYCE at another place that's just a block away, which was horrible. 

Service wasn't great and the servers weren't so polite, but I don't really expect that when I go for AYCE anyway."}
{"text":"I ordered the sashimi, and the slices they didn't feel fresh at all - nor did they seem like they were sliced with care - they were big and fat. I wouldn't come back to eat the sashimi."}
{"text":"It is so very hard to rate this place.  A 2 star seems a little stingy, but a 3 star too high.  In the end, I settled for a 3 star because it deserves some extra points for people watching.  

Pros:  Relatively decent sushi and rolls for an AYCE.  Fast.  

Cons:  Everything was too sweet (including the soya sauce), selection was not amazing for lunch buffet (no sashimi!).  Service was Meh with the chefs at the sushi bar telling the waitresses in Chinese who needed service.  

Extra Pro (thus justifying extra points):  Great place to watch people eat 30+ pieces of salmon and white tuna sushi each.  I miss the days when it was possible to eat that much without gaining a million pounds."}
{"text":"Got recommended by someone that this place was pretty good and decided to come here with friends. But lunch rush already started and we had to wait for a table for a long time with a line of people behind us. 
The sushi was decent but the first plate of sushi, the rice was already falling apart or forget one more piece of yam tempura that we ordered. Either way we were pretty satisfied and the service was good since they would come by to refill your water or take the paper of your orders while dealing with other customers. Might come back again"}
{"text":"I like this Japanese restaurant. I usually eat here. $11.99 all you can eat for lunch is really great! The food is delicious, but service isn't very good. So, four stars!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch all you can eat. It was 33 degrees in the street, and guess what, no ac in the restaurant. Instead, there were only a few fan towers in the restaurant. If my friend and I weren't that hungry we would have left, and after we sat down we regret not going elsewhere. Waitresses were not too friendly neither. Food was okay, but for the same price (33 bucks for 2) I m sure you can find elsewhere better."}
{"text":"I have been this place many time ,because theirs price is very good deal for AYCE..   But, at 2 month ago, I bring my friend to Kyoto for eating buffet, first We have order the 3 spicy salmon rolls, the one of the spicy salmon , we see the hair inside,We was like WTF is that. And other spicy salmon roll. We see the fish scale were mix together of spicy Salmon. The roll is very mess.And We have wait for long time  for get our food. At last,my friend has order ten pieces of salmon sushi, they put to much rise in sushi.. I remember I been here before, im seating near sushi bar,there's a thin guy stand on the middle of sushi bar ,I don't know what he's name,  he is very FAST  for making our sushi, And rise still hot, soft. Very tasty. Why there so big different between now and before.maybe the chef is new. MOST IMPORTANT THING is I saw a cockroach are running Through my foot,, and I tell the waiter,there's a alive cockroach r running at the floor. They just say ok to me, then act like nothing happen..   

I was very disappoint about this restaurant , the sushi are worse than before,hygiene are worse than before. Anyways, I'm not gonna go here anymore, and I will tell all my friend, Kyoto house was so dirty right now."}
{"text":"Same as many of the other comments, food is good, selection is good, price is excellent (biggest bang for your buck is you are staving), staff is very attentive. 

However, CLEANNESS is an issue. Floor is always dirty looking, washroom is dirty, they need an overhaul in cleaning the place up."}
{"text":"Didn't like the service, didn't like the food (I got the sashimi). The side lettuce was swimming  in ultra sweet sauce... Japango, next door, is much better (slightly more expensive though)."}
{"text":"Me and my friends had AYCE here a little while ago. Contrary to its popularity (I always see people lining up for this place), I find this place frustrating. For starters, they dilute the soy sauce with water. When we asked for proper soy sauce, they gave us small packets of take-out soy sauce - indirectly admitting that our bottle of diluted soy sauce was no coincidence. The servers were impatient, unresponsive. Food was mediocre at best. I got so frustrated with them that I had to sign-up an account on Yelp to tell all you prospective customers this."}
{"text":"One of my favourite all you can eat sushi place. The place has a good amount of crowd so the food is fresh.

The presentation is generic. the taste is good , portions are generous value is good.

The service may be little slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. This used to be a good sushi AYCE restaurant but they had to revise their business model to compete with new AYCE places opening in downtown Toronto.

Lunch and dinner are both fairly priced and they serve really fast. Salad and soup usually come 2 minutes after ordering and kitchen food come within 5 minutes. With that said, the quality of the rolls and sushi have declined over the years with fish being not so fresh and the rice will be warm.

Overfall you get a nice full meal, good place for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Went with my younger sister and her friend for lunch. It was packed to the Max so we had to wait a while and I was kind concerned about how they kept track of who came in when because people were pouring in. Anyway. Service was OK. But it was a busy lunch hour so I could see that happening. Oftentimes with AYCE sushi, orders get left out and such and that happened on and off throughout our lunch. We double ordered as a result and found ourselves stuffing food down our throats so as not to waste. I'm no guru when it comes to sushi rolls but these are the best I've had. Both the udon noodle soup and dish were tasty. Anything that was fried in tempura and then wrapped was amazing. Didn't like their teriyaki chicken. It was dry and not cooked well. Green tea ice cream was a good pallet cleanser at the end. I would definitely recommend it as a cheap sushi spot."}
{"text":"Their salmon sashimis are thick and yummy. Their rolls are huge and very filling. Fried calamari tempura is fresh.

A few tables of Japanese which show it is quite an authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"I go to Kyoto House at least once a month, and take friends.  I get a kick out of the servers, who are really friendly if you're friendly to them.  The sushi is almost always very good, especially for the price, and for an AYCE place.  Good value!"}
{"text":"The service was not bad. Food was not bad, but not the best.  It was busy. Looks busy every time I passed by this place. Price is ok."}
{"text":"Good when you are hungry and not particularly fussy about quality.  Service was fast, food came quickly, and price is the lowest ive seen for AYCE in the downtown core.  Just don't expect super fresh fish and you won't be disappointing."}
{"text":"So I have gone here three times for take out, and two times out of the three, I have been charged more than what the price of each item on the menu is. The first time, I just order two yam tempura rolls without checking the menu because that is always what I get. The second time I went, I looked at the menu and ordered the same thing but added a spicy salmon hand roll. I realized the first time I had been there, I was charged more than it's  price. Today, I went to go pick up exactly the same items. and the women at the cashier charged me more for my salmon hand roll than it was. It is not the price difference that makes me angry, it is the fact that they increased the price. As business owners, their profit should not rely not the increase of a dollar or two."}
{"text":"Just your average AYCE Sushi place. $11.99 for lunch and $18.99 for dinner. Unlike other sushi places, it does not increase prices for weekends and holidays, which is awesome. They have pretty fast service depending on how packed it is and like some restaurants, they may miss your order (but who's counting, order more!). Unfortunately, they only have Green Tea & Red Bean ice cream."}
{"text":"Located in between Dundas and St. Patrick stations, this AYCE sushi restaurant is conveniently located and has a great low price for pretty tasty sushi ($13.99 not incl. tax AYCE lunch, $47.44 incl. tax for two people AYCE dinner). I usually come here at least once a month for lunch or dinner, and each time my taste buds enjoy their salmon sushi. Their soy sauce is not too salty, nor is their rice too vinegar-y. I love feeling the contrast between the fresh warm rice and the cool fish. I am a bit biased since I can seem to only eat the salmon, surf clam, and red snapper sushi options, however that doesn't stop me from coming here as my go-to sushi place, or other sushi places. Peak hours are especially during lunch time such that people wait to be seated, however that has not happened to me yet. Service is really quick and they are good about filling up our waters, but it's happened quite a few times where the ice cream we ordered, which is listed at the bottom of the order paper, is not given to us. Overall, if you're a simple sushi eater like me, this is the place to go for cheap, yummy, and quick sushi."}
{"text":"I went for lunch, quick seating, nice place.  I don't know why, but the food just seemed to be lacking something.   It tastes different from the other sushi places I've been to.  The miso soup was pretty good though.  I agree that they do sometimes miss items that you order for AYCE..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch as we were looking for a reasonable priced all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant near our workplace.  It wasn't that the food was bad, it just wasn't very memorable - just meh...good enough that if I had no other choice I'd consider returning, but reluctantly.  The price point for lunch is good - $11.99. However, the menu is very limited (not sure if the dinner menu is perhaps better).  I normally order a lot of maki but this restaurant does not have great maki options.  Yes, you can get shrimp tempura rolls but they have just shrimp inside (no cucumber, avocado or anything)...they don't have dynamite rolls or dragon rolls on the AYCE menu.  
The food does come quickly despite the restaurant being relatively full and there are lots of servers around to wave down when you need something."}
{"text":"I think I prefer to enjoy smaller amounts of food rather than eating lots just for the sake of eating lots. Nonetheless, AYCE is a good type of place for big groups. Hence we visited Kyoto House because we were looking for an alternative to Aji Sai in the downtown area. This place was packed for a weeknight, so good thing we had a reservation. We got one of the back rooms for our party of 7, which would have been nice if it wasn't for the awkward column that basically separated one seat from the rest of the table. Food came at decent speed. Quality was mediocre. However, what I could not tolerate was how our 60 something pieces of sushi order came on a plate that was no more than 12x12\", all squished together in a grid, half falling apart when we tried to pick one up, and warmish. Enough said. Will not return."}
{"text":"I agree with Tammy.
This was one of the worst sushi places I've been too.
I had all you can eat lunch and the food there made me dislike sushi...
The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rolls were soso. The rice used to the roll didn't taste that good either.
No offense but this place is for those who don't know what \"good\" sushi tastes like...
The chicken udon was salty and the chicken was hard to bite.
The noodle didn't taste good.
I would never go back even if it was free.
The orange they served at the end of the meal was the best part.
Also, the waitress weren't that friendly."}
{"text":"Lunch with 2 other co-workers was plentiful. We ordered over 75 sushi and tempura and ice cream. Everything was good for a reasonable price especially for an all you can eat and the selections that were offered. I was a bit disappointed when they did not offer tea like other Japanese restaurants do. Also if the owners read this PLEASE make sure you complete the orders as we were given less than we ordered and had to reorder and wait for it. Overall great food, attentive service, and affordable prices."}
{"text":"Sushi here was actually pretty good this night. 

Came here before and their servings went bad after the second round, having bones left inside the sashimi but wasn't the case this time. All sashimi orders were perfectly sliced and tasted fresh, the spicy scallop hand rolls and maki sushi leaves you wanting more. 

Also this place has better tempura shrimp I find than others,  with the nice price of $19 for the ayce dinner. I would say this is my go to place for sushi if we're not looking for new ones."}
{"text":"Foods ok , not that much options for all u can eat sushi. Ice cream really good. Good location , parking on the street or across at chestnut. Usually busy due to it being at Dundas and bay"}
{"text":"The sushi is not high end and not nicely done.  I made reservations during lunch with coworkers and deliberately went earlier so I can ensure we got the table and order first so that no one will be late for their allowed one hour lunch. The restaurant wouldn't seat me first even though we had the table ready and they wouldn't take my order until everyone arrived.  Although the food came fast, they messed up our orders, didn't bring enough water, tea, utensils,  etc  and in the end we were still late. I don't think we would come back as there are others with better service in the same street."}
{"text":"We frequently go to Kyoto House for all-you-can-eat sushi. Some might even say we go there excessively. They are usually quick to serve their food, I didn't get sick from their food, and their service was not abysmal. More importantly, this restaurant was convenient to walk to after work.

However, there was an incident that happened on the night of December 23, 2010; and after learning of our experience you will come to realize how we could never come back to that restaurant again. We ordered our usual platter of sashimi that night. Upon reaching for a piece of white tuna sashimi, there was a single strand of pubic hair on the underside of the fish. Trying to rationalize the discovery, my friend and I suggested that the hair could have fallen off of somebody's head, or perhaps it was from a beard. But after a quick scan around the restaurant, none of the kitchen or hosting staff had hair that resembled the indisputably coarse and wavy texture of pubic hair.

After hailing the waitress, we told and unveiled to her the pubic hair and the tainted sashimi piece. The waitress was quick to remove the offending platter, and promptly showed the three sushi chefs (while being carefully scrutinized by myself; since the sushi bar is open to the rest of the dining area). I was apalled to find that they all chuckled over the incident like little schoolgirls, until they realized that they were in an open kitchen and scanned the restaurant; Upon locking into my discerning glare, they correct themselves and the waitress reapproaches our table to offer a deal. To compensate us for our atrocious finding, they were going to graciously waive us the HST of 13% off of our bill. While dry-heaving and holding back vomit, I began to wonder if she would take me up on the offer of giving her $2.47 if she allowed my friend and I to spectate while she ingested the unsightly hair with a piece of white tuna growing off the side of it. Instead, I reiterated the fact that we are frequent customers and that 13%off does not equate to the repulsive experience we had that night. I further asked to speak with the manager. The waitress comes back with someone who seemed to be another fellow waitress and she was quick to comp the meal for myself, but not my friend. It was infuriating to know that this was the best that they could do. As we leave the restaurant, one of the kitchen staff gives me a smirk...

needless to say, complaint filed to DineSafe, food premises inspection and disclosure. for better or worse, i can safely say that I will never be going back to Kyoto House for japanese food again.

{"text":"There are relatively few (respectable) sushi places downtown, and this one is among the latest nasty additions to the list of gross-out raw fish joints in the neighbourhood.

Actually, this could possibly be the worst. I know, I'm being \"way harsh\", and it's true, maybe they were having an off-day. I have seen this place packed during the evening, and I can imagine they must do well with the business crowd in the lunchtime. However, when we swung in at 3:00 pm to give it a try, we were the only ones there. (A few tables filled up by the time we left).

I went with the $9.99 sashimi lunch special, which came with soup and salad. The soup was the best part of the meal, mostly because it was the only thing that was as hot as it should have been. The salad was completely doused in the creamy sauce. A bit much.

The tea came and it was at the worst possible temperature - cold. Not cold like \"chilled\", but as in the been-sitting-out-for-2-hours cold. Seriously?

Our server brought the rice out way before the fish arrived, so by the time I was ready to enjoy it it was an unsettling room temperature. Now the sashimi arrived and it even looked bad. Sitting in a shallow pool of water (likely melted off the frozen fish), and, my oh my, what is this? Half of the sashimi was imitation crab and 2 nasty mini shrimps sliced down the middle! The white tuna tasted a little bizarre too, though that might've been psychological because the whole meal was such a disaster. I know, when you pay ten bucks for sashimi, what do you expect, but really - do we have to be punished for watching the wallet?

I'm going to say it - this was the worst sushi experience I've had in the city. If you have a bit more to spend, head to Japango next door, or for your cheap sushi fix, stay in the Annex."}
{"text":"After reading some of the previous mixed reviews, I decided to give this place the ol once over. I went with my boss because we were celebrating her promotion. We were looking for something close to work and kyoto house was nearby. We were slightly apprehensive due to some of the reviews.

As it turns out our apprehension should have been outright terror because the food here is a nightmare. I wish I was exaggerating as does my stomach. My boss isn't coming to work tomorrow.

We went in for the all you can eat lunch special and had the avocado, salmon and avocado, unagi, tako (octopus), salmon skin and cucumber hand roll, calamari, avocado and cucumber and the avocado and \"mango\" roll.

The avocado had brown spots and was mushy. None of the fish was fresh. Half of our salmon was severely discoloured (and reeked). The unagi and salmon skin looked and tasted  like shredded brown paper towel given a once over with silver spray paint. All the fish was mushy and the rolls were falling apart with soggy seaweed and overcooked, stale rice  ( I wasn't aware this combination was possible prior to this ). The mango and avocado roll featured unripe disgusting mango and very questionable avocado. 

The service, if it could be called that, consisted of our waitress quite literally smashing our plates down on our table with enough force to make our water ripple like something out of jurassic park. There was no warmth or indeed words or interest in their service. They even tried to take away unfinished plates of sushi which we were clearly attempting to eat. In retrospect I think they were trying to save us from their \"chefs\". 

On the plus side service was fast. But too fast and the food showed the rush. The cucumber and water were fresh at least, but only served to show how sad the rest of the food was. The price was reasonable but I could just drink sewage for free instead.

We left feeling nauseous and generally unwell and unsatisfied. 

Great place to come for a quick, easy break up. Just order the unagi for your SO. Do yourself a favour and don't even come near this place. This \"restaurant\" ruined what was supposed to be a celebration."}
{"text":"Great food at fair prices, but caddy staff for sure!"}
{"text":"I was here for the AYCE supper on a Tuesday around 7 and was on my own.  Unlike most of the other reviews, I had great service all night long - my orders and bill came quickly, and the waitresses stopped by often to top up my water and ask if I needed anything.  The sushi, sashimi and tempura that I had was good, on par with what I get  at nicer places at home in Edmonton.  $18.99 for the supper, which I thought was about right.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Great for casual sushi, never had a bad experience. Sometimes they will forget something but they are quick to bring more. I usually go in early when they open and I see the fresh fish deliveries daily."}
{"text":"I had the yaki udon noodles.  Nothing great but I was in the neighbourhood.  The service was quick, prices are $10+ for bento boxes and main entrees at dinner.  Most of the customers are students ordering the AYCE dinner for $18.99.

As described by one of the other reviewers I did notice the sweet tasting white dressing on the salad."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday late lunch 11.99 super cheap. Service was acceptable.
Rolls didn't have a lot of rice on them. Sushi was mediocre. Yam and Avocado tempura was good though. Free tea and refills but had to ask everytime. 
Hand rolls were bursting with filling which was nice.

Would probably go again for a cheap sushi fix."}
{"text":"Sashimi is not fresh at all. And the tempura sauce tastes weird! It's not sweet but tastes very salty. The BBQ ribs have been burned! The spider roll is half hot half cold probably microwaved the soft shell crab inside and the fish eggs on top was frozen."}
{"text":"The service is good and the staff are all super quick to bring you your order. The atmosphere is pretty good too. My favourite item on the menu is the avacado/mango sushi rolls. I highly reccomend them!! DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good,  cheap sushi place. $12.99 lunch and $19.99 dinner. Quality is just ok. I like how there's not alot of rice in the sushi and rolls unlike some ayce sushi place. Service was fairly fast but they didn't give all that we ordered. We had to re-ordered some items again the 2nd time."}
{"text":"I think based on our experience, there was nothing bad about this place, but there was nothing remarkable about it either. I have had better and worse.
Everything tasted fresh, came quickly, nothing over or undercooked.
We most preferred any of their crispy rolls. The only problem I had was that some of them fell apart as soon as I picked them up.
Service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know nobody likes this place.

For lunch, it's only $12.99 for AYCE sushi! Sure, this place is also jam packed full of people. Sure, the people who make the food aren't Japanese. Why do people make such a big deal out of that?

Personally, I love the sushi here for what you pay for. They're the perfect bite sized pieces. The waitresses are not that bad, but food comes out as fast as McDonald's."}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat; they have a lovely giant sign outside informing me of this. Service was prompt and very informative on what people enjoy. Came in very hungry from not eating all day, I neglected eating in favor of exploring Toronto. When I left I was quite full and satisfied with the meal. Essentially everything I ordered was delicious, so there wasn't a dish I was not satisfied with."}
{"text":"I went to Kyoto House probably about a year or two ago with a friend for All-You-Can-Eat dinner while in the area. I was pretty surprised because I was definitely impressed by how fresh their sashimi was - I remember the salmon was really creamy and not fishy at all! 

Service wasn't bad and unlike many other AYCE establishments, the food came out pretty quick (especially the sushi/sashimi, not just the cooked/fried foods). I found the price to be pretty reasonable too. 

The reason why it's only 3 stars? I went again a few months ago for a conference and a group of friends and I stopped by for lunch. We didn't go for the AYCE option as none of us were super hungry. I got a sashimi combo set, but I was not impressed by their sashimi. It looked super appetizing, but it tasted AWFUL. I think this is the only instance where I didn't finish my sashimi and had to spit parts out... the red tuna my combo had was rock hard, stringy, and had no taste - the meat was so tough it had the texture of overcooked beef. There was also cooked shrimp sashimi with my combo but tasted nasty as well. Not sure why the sashimi is a total hit for AYCE but a total miss for regular lunch options when the food is the same...

So I'd take this place with a grain of salt. I think if you do go it is best to go for AYCE dinner as that was the only positive experience I had with this place."}
{"text":"If you're on a budget and craving for some all you can eat sushi, Kyoto house is the place for you. Dinner menu isn't anything special, just your typical ayce menu. Sashimi wasn't the freshest, but hey, you're paying 20 bucks. Overall, worth the try for dinner time. As for the lunch menu, I suggest you putting in an extra 7 bucks and go for the dinner menu. Menu was very limited, for some reason the food didn't taste the same as dinner time. You could probably find some place better with ayce for 13.99. Service wasn't great but it wasn't terrible. They're always very busy but under staffed as well."}
{"text":"This sushi place is not bad, it's okay. AYCE dinner is cheap! $19.99 per person, although the variety of the menu is a decent amount. Customer service is great! Very quick and active.

Things I didn't like about this place are: 
-They sometimes forget your order
-Some of the dishes are not that fresh and it tasted really mediocre

Overall, cheap AYCE dinner and great service but food is okay."}
{"text":"It seems like my friends and I always come here whenever we're craving sushi while we're downtown. The sushi is good, but not extremely fantastic. The service is also O.K. I always go here with a large group, so we always get put into one of the large rooms at the back, which are super comfy."}
{"text":"I think I gave a good tip when I checked in on yelp and was eating lunch here (the 11.99 sushi special).

I'm going to have to take that back since after my lunch here I had to worst stomach ache and threw up my food. While I was eating lunch I thought the rice tasted too sour from the vinegar. The sauce on one of the sushi tasted a little off but I wasn't expecting \"awesome\" for $11.99 all you can eat sushi.... but I wasn't expecting to throw up either. 

11.99 is too high a price to pay for an evening of discomfort, skip this place if you have plans for a night out in town because you will be swapping it for a 'soirée a la toilette'."}
{"text":"I've actually stopped by here on a couple occasions in the last couple weeks, once for their $5.99 lunch special and most recently for their AYCE $18.99 dinner.

On both visits I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the sushi was, probably some of the freshest I've had in the Toronto area.
I was a little put off by the earlier review of the sashimi in melted ice, I can vouch though that on both my visits that was not the case. In fact, the sashimi I had was again probably some of the freshest I've had in Toronto. Quite enjoyable.

Their all you can eat menu is pretty extensive for $18.99. There are many rare pieces you wouldn't usually find on an all you can eat menu (Philadelphia Roll) which really kicked it up a notch above.

Their fried tempura and calamari was nicely battered. It had a bit of an oiliness to it though which I'm sure some would appreciate. I myself would have preferred a little more straining beforehand, but in the interest of time it was definitely acceptable.

Their side dishes like salmon and chicken teriyaki weren't the best I've had but were definitely up top par if not better than most AYCE places. I'm sure that the a la carte teriyaki would be much improved.

The green tea ice cream for dessert on the AYCE was also an added treat.

Service was great in both visits. It also has a very nice atmosphere and is incredibly clean, something I'm sorry to say I can't say for many other sushi restaurants in the general vicinity.

With a very large menu (with explanations of each roll - much appreciated), freshly prepared fish, and great service at $18.99 I'd have to put this place over the vast majority of even the most shi-shi AYCE places in Toronto.

My only gripe with their menu is that when attending an a la carte dinner $15.99 for a bento box is hardly value priced."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the the worst AYCE sushi joints in Toronto I've ever been to in terms of food presentation. The customer service was good, servers had their eye on the ball the whole time. Though this sushi place would deserve 5 stars if they actually executed the sushi properly (now I'm no sushi expert but I like the way how sushi looks when it's well put ; instead it looks like they mashed everything together. Wish I could have taken aesthetically appealing sushi pics, but the fish would disown the rice before my chopsticks even came near the sushi."}
{"text":"I used to working in a sushi restaurant so I think I might have a better view of sushi. The AYCE menu choices are limited but not so bad. The waitress are really rude about handing the food to your table, and the most sushi tasted bad because of the sushi rice, the cooked food like beef short ribs are really soft which is probably not fresh, and the shrimp are tasteless. There are only few things on the menu are worth to try, but I don't think I will go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I have noticed a lot of people complain about bad service for this place. I would not expect amazing service when it is all you can eat for only $14.99, and there is only about 3-4 servers for over 20 tables. During the time we were there every employee was running around, grabbing plates, filling water glasses, and taking the orders. There is no time for courtesy when the place is crazy busy. 
We actually had a nice server who despite looking exhausted was very friendly. Every time we called her to the table she asked \"ice cream?\" which I thought was funny, as if she was hoping we get the amazing ice cream they had!! She also joked around a bit when we couldn't finish an order and asked her to take it back.
The reason why I am giving this place 3 stars is not because of the service, but because of the menu. 
There is no shrimp item on the menu, no sashimi and the roll options are quite limited. The fish is not super fresh either. But what can you really expect for such a good price?"}
{"text":"Come here if you prefer quantity over quality.  Our orders came out quickly since they have several people working, however the sushi was not prepared very well which is generally what I expect from a AYCE sushi. There was excessive rice in each roll and the rice was unusually warm. The fish quality was subpar and at times a bit sketchy when we ordered the sashimi. Some of the white fish sashimi started turning yellowish/grey as it sat on the table.  If you are starving and need to fill your belly, come here, but don't have quality expectations."}
{"text":"Mediocre meal. Not the best a la carte Japanese food I've ever had, it's \"all you can eat\" grade. Rude servers, being brought a bill & machine as soon as my bill came was shocking. Servers giggling and saying sorry... sorry for what? Establishment is dirty and not well kept."}
{"text":"The quality initially was superb, however the last time I went the quality of some of the sushi was subpar."}
{"text":"I used to come here occasionally if I was at Eaton Centre and craved ayce sushi. I decided to come back today since my friends work downtown. It was way worse than I expected even thought my expectations were already rock bottom low. 

The service was non existent to disrespectful. We had to ask three different waiters for our water and one of them told us five minutes...for water? Midway through our meal we finally got them. They randomly refilled the water, ie only the ones closest to them. My friend got a piece of lettuce in her water. When we asked for another piece of order paper, the waitress was really hesitant and told us we should finish our food on the table first. We understand and respect not wasting food and we told her we only wanted an extra miso soup and edamame. 

Food quality was rock bottom. Menu selection was extremely limited. The salmon roses were stuffed with a disproportionate amount of rice. Imagine six salmon roses taking up same amount of plate space as 20 pieces of sashimi plus height. The sashimi wasnt too gross as they were at a cool temperature and was acceptably fresh. The tempura batter was insanely thick maybe 3:1 batter to shrimp. The teriyaki wasn't even grilled properly and just had a dribble of teriyaki sauce on top. Rolls were disgusting. We ordered all three of the special ones and they were pretty indistinguishable in terms of ingredients. The shells of the tempura shrimps weren't cleanly removed and the avocado was browning in them.

I will never come here again. Keep in mind that it has a low price but not even that low considering what is being served ($20.99 for dinner). The best things were the water, miso soup, and a little portion of sashimi."}
{"text":"I'd rather chew on farts than eat here again. Sushi was warm. End of story. Just bad. Way too many better options close by."}
{"text":"Came back for the first time in a long while since I graduated from university and don't have any reason to go to Toronto as much as I used to. I always look forward to coming downtown so I can eat some good sushi. Anyways, I had a concert to attend in Toronto last Saturday (GD in case you were wondering), so what better chance could I get to stop by here and eat my fill of sushi?

The food was top notch and everything came at lightning speed. I've been here quite a lot over the years, so I know sometimes the service is slow, sometimes the food isn't as fresh as it is other times, and the food just in general varies per visit. However, this time they were on their A-game and I was very satisfied.

We came in at around 2:30pm on a Saturday. We ordered tonkatsu, chicken teriyaki, garden salads, shrimp tempura rolls, and (my personal eternal favourite) salmon sushi. The tonkatsu was light and crisp and the chicken teriyaki was fried perfectly (so perfect I ordered a second one but they gave too little sauce the second time T_T). I knew the salmon sushi here had thicker salmon in comparison to other sushi places; it was thick enough that you could actually taste salmon and not just rice. I was very happy to see that that hasn't changed. Everything felt very fresh, everything was steaming hot (the miso soup, for example), and cooked perfectly.

My favourite thing about Kyoto House is their salad. It's divine. I have no idea whats in the sauce, but its creamy, thick, sweet and tangy, and absolutely delicious. I eat at least 3 salads every time I come here. It's my favourite salad out of all the places I've ever been and all the salad sauces I've tried.

I don't really understand why Kyoto gets so much hate. Again, it's an AYCE sushi place for $13.99, the place I go to in Mississauga has worse food for $16.99. So for me, Kyoto House is fantastic. Of course, if you go in expecting 5 star level pay-per-roll non-AYCE sushi quality stuff, you'd be disappointed. But for me, Kyoto has good quality food, good service (for the most part lol, and even when it doesn't, the food makes up for that), and good pricing. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Sugar, sugar, everywhere.

I wanted to like Kyoto House; their fish tastes fresh and the service was actually quite accommodating for our party of 14. However, their method of hiding sugar in every. darned. thing. was frustrating and off-putting. Even their soy sauce tasted like darkened sugar water, and when I asked for \"salty soy sauce\", the waitress didn't bat an eye, bringing back a basket of packets. Based on the way she responded, I feel like this kind of request must be fairly common. Which is unsurprising, given that all of the sushi is unusually sweetened.

Moreover, although lunch is pretty cheap ($11.99 ayce), they didn't have any dynamite or rainbow rolls, which I prefer and which are offered by plenty of lunchtime ayce places (e.g. Aji Sai). It must be admitted though that their sushi (versus maki) were pretty good, largely thanks to the freshness of the fish. But unfortunately the unrelenting sugar-sweetness was a deal-breaker... And the salmon skin roll literally ruined appetites, claiming 5-6 casualties at our table. Avoid at all costs.

I might come back if friends absolutely insisted - and only order sushi (and maybe eel maki), with a special request for \"salty soy sauce\"."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap place to grab AYCE sushi at lunch. The variety isn't much but my experience here is pretty fluky. The couple times I came, their food would come out hot and fresh, other times ..weeeeell not so much. I ordered spicy salmon rolls, it wasn't spicy at all, it was super mushy, cold and bland as if the food was chewed up and spit back out. Also, would never order their battered/fried dishes...I don't know what kind of batter they use for tempura but it comes out soggy and tastes like old socks. The servers are also a bit rude with the way they drop off the food, they just toss it in front of you like you're an animal."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time, chose it based on yelp comments left. We didn't have many options on Canada day, and some comments said its decent. So we took a chance. This place not only has the worst customer service...the food is absolutely disgusting, messy, smells and tastes gross. As soon as we walked, it smelled like a fish market! Like really stinky fish. My bf and I should've walked out...but we were starving, the place was packed! So we figured its fine.

How wrong we were...

1)      we got the lunch menu which has the worst choices ever.

2)      The table was wet when we sat down

3)      Bf ordered chicken teriyaki, which came out freezing cold. He couldn't eat it at all

4)      We ordered yam tempura, dumplings, springs rolls which never ever came to the table

5)      The sushi...omg..please see my picture. I mean what the hell is this sloppy mess! That's actually how they served that to us. It looks like someone sat on it. We couldn't eat this either, it was just so disgusting looking.

6)      We had to ask more than once to get refills on our drinks, which was badly needed to wash down this nasty food

7)      Got the fried chicken udon, loaded with what tastes like teriyaki and brown sugar. Don't eat if you have diabetes. I only finished it because I had no other food to eat.

8)      And to top it all off...both of us have been best friends with the toilet this morning. -_- should've seen that coming!


DO NOT EAT HERE!  Smelly, messy, food poisonous sushi...ugh! 0* all the way across the board."}
{"text":"My friends and I usually come here when we finish our Midterms/Exams, but keep in mind we only come here for the food. The Service? Not so much. The decor is decent nothing really fancy, they have a separate rooms/private room for a Traditional seating which is a good touch, but still not really much to talk about.  

The Sushi they offer is decent and worth the price for All-You-Can-Eat. Now about the service, as a mentioned before this place has the WORST service ever, It literally took them 30 - 40 minutes to get my order and it wasn't even too much food. The servers always gives me a grunt if i request something or if i want more Sushi. One of them had serious hygiene issue (probably never heard of a Toothbrush) and yelled at us to get out of the restaurant fast so they can seat other customers. The real question is that how can I get out of the restaurant if they never give me my food? So of course i'll be taking my time, since they're taking their time to give me my order!

Bottom line: If you're looking for a place for Good Sushi, but bad service Go here otherwise go somewhere else if your looking for good sushi and great service."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi for lunch and didnt have a lot of time to go to a nice place. I ended up going here for the lunch buffet which is $11.99. The ambiance is very basic although the staff is very friendly and polite. Food arrives quick and is decent. The selection is very limited for lunch with about a dozen rolls and cooked foods like teriyaki, tempura, pork cutlets etc. No sashimi, dragon rolls, spider, dynamite etc. 

The experience was average and I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to eat here but if you are in the area and up for some cheap sushi, you have the address!"}
{"text":"I've been to so many ayce places. I can give only 2 stars. The foods are just 2 stars worth."}
{"text":"Great yam rolls and cucumber avocado rolls!!! Always super fresh!! Service can be kind of hit or miss and usually forgets some of the food you order. Although they food you get is always great!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????ayce???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ayce?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????6?._. ???????????????????"}
{"text":"I love sushi in general, so there is nothing bad to say about this place. For the price, all you can eat sushi is decent. However, there is no sashimi for this option. Food is prepared fresh and comes in reasonable portions. Dessert and soup is also included. Overall, a great experience for the price."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a cheap AYCE place.

At 13.99 for lunch I'd say Kyoto offers a pretty decent variety of menu items, all of acceptable quality. Nothing special about the food, but it is super cheap.

Dinner is around $20 but includes ayce sashimi. Surprisingly the salmon and butterfish sashimi were very generously cut; they were nice thick slices that tasted fresh and not frozen like some other places! The spider and dynamite rolls were good but a little large, as per your typical ayce place. The spicy salmon/tuna hand rolls were good as well. Some of the other sushi (imitation crab/surf clam/tofu skin/fish egg) were not as good; the white tuna was a little chewy. Cooked meat dishes were not bad. Tempura variety was kind of limited, only offering yam, shrimp and avocado.

Service was okay. It usually gets pretty busy but if you're in one of the back rooms the waiters are quick to bring dishes in and out, refill your tea and replace your order sheet. Overall, a good place for large groups and stuffing yourself full :P"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful, my girlfriend and I came here for ayce. Good price at $19 per person but I would rather pay more money for better quality food and service. 

The service is terrible and the tables were not clean. For whatever reason they have tempura sauce in their soy sauce containers... Gross. When we asked for real soy sauce we were given a handful of soy sauce packets... What type of sushi restaurant doesn't have real soy sauce in a bottle!? 

The rolls were so poorly put together that they could barely be picked up without falling apart and they all taste the same.

Will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"The food quality is great, but the service is really slow... especially when you want a refill on your drink or when you're in one of the private rooms with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Went there for Saturday lunch. Had to say that if you go for cheap price then don't expect for the quality. Apart from the hard rice, the ginger slices were dried and wrinkled, as if they'd been left outside overnight...the avocados in the rolls were turned into black, not fresh at all, so let alone the fish. Asked for water but only got to drink it when we almost finished.

Nevertheless, it's hard to find such a cheap AYCE sushi place in downtown. One star for the good price."}
{"text":"Access
Short walk from Eaton's Centre. If you don't want to walk, taking the street car is your second option.

Service
Pretty standard asian service. They gave us a small table for 2 and when we asked for a bigger one they said no lol. My friend attempted to reason with them and finally they gave in. I would say that my friend has some great bargaining skills. The service here is better than most AYCE sushi restaurants because they collect dishes very quickly and actually remember our orders. Not bad for an asian place.

Food 
AYCE restaurants offer a lot of variety and fills you up quickly. Kyoto House has one of the smallest menus that I have seen but their sushi is pretty good. First off, the rice is not falling off and their sashimi is fresh. I would say that the pieces could be cut smaller but that's a minor detail. Their grilled selection is super tiny but a few items really caught my attention, including the salmon and ribs. Just so you guys know we paid $19.99 on a Thursday night which is significantly cheaper than the prices in Scarborough/Markham/Richmond Hill. I won't lie, this place is average at best but they aren't exactly ripping you off."}
{"text":"Came for 12.99 weekday lunch. 
- Semi-decent variety of nigiri sushi for an ayce place
- Semi-decent quality. Okay size rice but thin piece of fish. For the masago and tobiko, also very small portion compared to the rice
- No beef teriyaki for lunch. No shrimp tempura for lunch
- Tempura calamari was okay. Yam tempura was ok. Both were huge.
- Service was good. Everything came pretty quick.

Quality: 5.5/10. Value: 6.5/10. Service 7.5/10. Overall 6/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Upon arriving we were seated immediately but got served refreshments 20 minutes later. The food was good but very downplayed by the awful service. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Ok. It may not be the best sushi you have ever tasted but for the price you pay, food is quite alright. They don't skimp on sushi."}
{"text":"Really nice Japanese food. 
And shipper than other Japanese restaurants all you can eat.
I'll go back there another day."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning for the second time after eating here. The quality is disastrous. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"A decent joint for AYCE in downtown... I Would love to see more choices and sashimi on the menu, possibly additional desserts too!!!"}
{"text":"Always liked this place until today. The waiter did mistake in our order so we kindly asked her to fix it. She said that she need to check if we are right. When she actually realized that she brought us the wrong order instead of making the new Philadelphia roll she just sprinkled cream cheese on top of avocado & salmon roll. Without any apology she just shoved the plate on a table."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had. The fish was terrible quality. The rich barely stuck together and the presentation was so weak that it hurt. The taste was bland, nothing special. DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I need you to know that this place does NOT offer good quality sushi or service. That being said, this is still my go-to ayce in downtown because it is highly student-budget friendly. Lunch is only $11.99 and goes until 5pm.. so what can I say, it's basically dinner.

Of course for the working class men and women then, I would probably advise ordering a bento box elsewhere. 

Also note that this place is definitely not \"a hidden gem\" or anything close to unknown. This place is practically the go-to for all university students in the area so you should expect that the service will be compromised. With large parties of students comes large orders of sushi and that often results in a much higher demand than supply during peak hours. I've found that every time I go, they ALWAYS leave out at least one order. It's not that they don't feed you, it's just that they don't give you exactly what you requested for.

All in all, the food is edible (no stomach aches yet!), decent tasting, and is a plausible place to consider when you want cheap and all you can eat sushi. Would I bring my fellow university friends here? Sure. Would I bring my relatives who are visiting Toronto? Probably not."}
{"text":"Kyoto's rating is falling at 2.5? I can see why yet I'm still a fan.

Probably the cheapest place to get AYCE sushi in downtown Toronto, Kyoto is still one of my favourite sushi restaurants. They have a pretty good selection for lunch with all the staples (salmon sushi, crispy spicy salmon rolls, red bean and green tea ice cream). My most recent experience at Kyoto was the best one yet. One of the servers was new (relative to my knowledge) and she provided good customer service. I know Kyoto's service is known for being a little rude or passive (which I did see during my meal) but that server was mannered. There was a couple near our table who found a hair beneath a sushi and one of the servers told them to just not eat it. Agreed but I think the couple wanted something out of it so they brought it to the sushi makers. None of my business though... maybe.

The slices of salmon were a great portion proportionate to the almount of rice. The sushi rolls came out fast too, this time we had no mistakes. Waters were refilled quickly and the paper you order from was given without us chasing down the servers. Everything was great. And for $13.99 it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Service is a little messy sometimes because is so busy, but i just loooove the sushi for the price and quantity."}
{"text":"La atención es rápida y eficiente, la comida sabrosa y variada, lo único que creo deben mejorar es la atención que al ser tan eficiente deja un poco de lado la amabilidad. Si uno viene por primera vez y no conoce el sistema se siente un poco perdido ya que nadie explica como funciona."}
{"text":"Soba noodles w/ chicken was just ok. Place was full of locals, so I was hopeful. Staff was friendly despite others reviews. I just think food was lacking. I wished I'd yelped before I leaped."}
{"text":"Real Japanese tastes in a hectic yet different concept.. small bites,many choices,real japanese tea. It's a very high tension way of eating,a real fast eating experience but worth to try once."}
{"text":"The service is alright. They pretty much want you to eat and get out. I don't normally get the all you can eat because I don't actually eat that much for lunch. They have lunch specials which in my opinion worth a lot more! You get Bento boxes for roughly 6.99+ and you get soup, salad, sushi, rice and they are in big portions so its worth your money! 

My go to lunch place when I meet up with friends. I would come here at 11:45 for lunch time though. It gets insane packed in here! Guess the food is good!"}
{"text":"Taken here by a friend who should know: a chinese guy.  Ordered an unusually large amount of food (for the buffet price, it was nice to try many things but holy cow it was a lot).  Not the freshest tasting but filling and more than enough for 2.  Took me a little while to get used to the brown rice flavor in green tea, my friend said it was to sweeten it up, but I thought it tasted more bitter than my \"usual\" tea.  Service was swift and serviceable."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, the salmon sushi is made of bad quality fish. shrimp tempura rolls is just tempura and very tiny pieces of shrimp. all in all experience: really bad and I am not coming again."}
{"text":"This is as average as it can get for an AYCE sushi experience. Usually I give run of the mill sushi restaurants 3 stars but I'll give Kyoto House an extra because their price is ridiculously good for their dinner AYCE. It's only. $20 same for weekdays and weekends. 

For a place that competes by price, you may question the quality. Frankly it's very acceptable. I never had anything bad. Sashimi is as fresh as you'd expect from an AYCE place. The Kalbi ribs are excellent every time. The sushi have decent fish-rice ratio. Pretty standard selection of rolls. They don't have any noteworthy specialties here.

Service is about what you expect from a Chinese run place. I've been here maybe 5 times and they have never messed up my order so far. They have a lot of customers for a reason. I recommend this place if you want to stuff yourself with as much sushi as possible for the lowest price possible. It's simply the best run of the mill AYCE in town."}
{"text":"My first one star review!
We wanted sushi and the venue I frequent in this area had an hour's wait. Reluctant yet hopeful we were when we came in here for some AYCE action. 
The big reason behind the one star review is the poor quality of food and the high percentage of rice that the sushi contains, some of those pieces were just too big to have in one go. On the other end of the spectrum, the sashimi was tiny (yes I know it's AYCE) and it broke down easy in the mouth and not in a smooth way either. For $20, I was not happy at all for what I received as ordering off the dinner menu would have been more cost effective and I assume a bit higher in quality. They also didn't have a good variety of menu options for AYCE, but I do admit we didn't go for any non sushi/sashimi options. 
The miso soup tasted like it did come straight from a instant packet.

Despite the one star, I am willing to try this venue again so I can determine if the normal menu might be able to redeem itself from what I think is quite possibly the least fun I've had easting sushi. 

Cheaper menu, less rice, quicker service would definitely bump Kyoto house 2 - 3 stars up!"}
{"text":"This might just be one of the cheapest AYCE sushi restaurants in the city! $21.99 any day? (written May 2018) Amazing! Of course it doesn't have a massive menu, but at that price I completely understand. 

Only thing that was disappointing was the seaweed on the handrolls was very chewy. The three of us were struggling to eat them. They gotta be crispier than that! But when we ordered the salmon sashimi, they delivered what we asked for.. not half or something like other restaurants like to do. And it tasted delicious. Their dessert options was only ice cream. These guys accept Mastercard but I think they recently stopped accepting Visa.

The servers are attentive, and chefs bring the food out quick. Make the seaweed crispy and this place would be perfect!"}
{"text":"As I was walking downtown, I stumbled upon this Japanese restaurant. I thought it was not that expensive, $18.99 for dinner. I was actually trying to find a recommended restaurant but they were $23.99 around the same general area.

The quality of the sushi was pretty good. The service was fast but not too friendly. =(

The variety of choices were limited. I didn't get to order my usual favourites but whatever they had to offer were also delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there on a Saturday, lured in with extremely low prices for AYCE sushi. What you get is decently prepared, fresh food. There's no beer on tap, and whichever bottle you order will be served in an Ikea glass, at best. Sushi selection seems genuine, with the exception of their white tuna which is admittedly escolar..

However..

The service is TRULY horrible. I felt like the staff literally didn't want any of their customer be present that night. For example, I asked what their beer selection was, and was given the grumpiest look possibly by their waitress. For this alone, I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Kyoto House is a typical AYCE Japanese restaurant where you can find dishes from Miso Soup to Sashimi to Maki Rolls. The price is very cheap and reasonable compared to the market price of various AYCE spots in the Toronto region. 

The quality of the food was very decent as the sashimi was very fresh and sliced with precision. The sushi rolls were very tasty as each piece packed a lot of flavour in each bite, especially with the avocado providing a nice suttle smooth taste.  

The quality of the restaurant interior can be varying , the design is very outdated and can use a makeover. Also, some places of the restaurant were a little dirty which was quite bothering. 

The service was fairly good as the wait staff was very attentive with our orders, and they came by a lot to check with our table to see how we were doing and continued refilling our cups with water.

I would have given a higher rating if this place can get their act together with the sanitary procedures for the benefit of the diners.  Overall, it was a great meal for a good price for $19.99."}
{"text":"Pretty good cheap sushi. Plating for noodles and fried foods is mediocre but the food quality isn't bad. Service is okay. Went here early and it was really silent so talking can be awkward."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE, I've come here about 3-4 times because the lunch ($12.99) is so cheap and really fills you up! The fish is always pretty good quality for cheap, it's fresh however the rice is alright. They water down their soy sauce though and somehow it's very sweet, so I usually don't use it much because it doesn't suit my taste. The variety is decent, has your basic sushi restaurant rolls.
The service is usually lousy since they're very rushed, unfriendly and its often unusual to see them smiling at you. The servers are usually yelling at each other in Chinese. They also sometimes \"forget\" to bring you your orders when you've been there awhile as I've experienced with a lot of AYCE places so honestly it doesn't bother me that much anymore. Slow refilling your cup and things such as that.
The decor and place isn't too bad though as well. It's very busy during lunch so I recommend always going a little early before lunch rush hour kicks in and you have to wait since the establishment isn't that big.

If you're a college/uni kid or someone who's craving a whole lot of sushi while keeping it cheap I definitely recommend it. Pretty good quality sushi with a great price, nothing more, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for ayce at a cheap price. But the quality definitely lacks - as you would expect from the price.

The quality is not amazing, and pretty inconsistent. If you're looking to eat sashimi, I would skip this place. Sometimes it's decent, sometimes it's straight up warm... lol. The rolls however are not bad! 

It can get pretty busy during dinner since it's not a big place so you can expect to sit real close to other parties. 

The service is nice and fast so it's a decent place for a quick meal if you're craving sushi."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this spot but nothing amazing either. 

Reasonable prices for AYCE. 
Very fast service. 
Staff seem nice enough. 
Food isn't unbelievable but it's pretty good.  Sashimi slices seemed a bit on the small end.

Anyways not a bad place. Feel like you can depend on it as a reasonable AYCE option"}
{"text":"I really feel that Kyoto can be a hit or miss. At times, it can be outstanding, considering how cheap it is, but at times it is very questionable.

This is the only place that makes Spicy Salmon rolls the way I like, and they also don't overload the rice in the sushi, so that's also a plus. They also offer stuff I can't seem to find at other sushi places, such as avocado tempura (yum).

It's also nice, how they have two separate party rooms, available for reservation for bigger groups.

The look of the restaurant itself makes me cringe at times, as it's not that clean or modern. I especially hate that table for two that they placed right in between the sushi bar and the end of the booth seating. I feel bad for anyone who sits there, it is such an awkward placement!

As well, the cups they serve water in are very gross, as some have bite marks or melt marks (whatever they are), I think it would have been nice to be given a straw, without having to ask. I don't think I'm asking for too much.

Again, it can be a hit or miss, if you can ignore all of these things I've mentioned, go for it! It's probably the cheapest price you can find for AYCE, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Honestly, don't read the other reviews because no one knows sushi better than i do. Kyoto House has the flavours and textures but lacks the variety. Other places like Spring Sushi are upscale and offers a large selection, but the taste is below par.

First off, kyoto house has mastered the soy sauce. They blended the normal kikoman with a sugary base, making the sauce a bit more viscose and syrupy compared to normal, salty soy sauce.

They do not fill you up with rice. Other places generally put very little filling and stinge out.

Probably never had a better crispy spicy salmon roll.

They do an avacado eel roll, its nice when you don't want stupid crunch cucumber in a soft roll.

Chicken fried udon is restaurant quality tasating

decor, is plain and typical. washrooms are gross

staff is fake friendly but does a good job serving you.

great price.

done."}
{"text":"Food and service are mediocre. They just give you a paper and a pencil and you check off whatever you want to eat. Exactly what you would expect from an all-you-can-eat sushi place."}
{"text":"I recommend  the All You Can Eat sushi here - $18.99/person.
Try the: sashimi, crunch roll, seaweed salad, dumplings, tempura
The atmosphere was nice, the service was top notch, and the food quality was excellent."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get AYCE sushi! There are some downsides so I can see what it gets 3 stars, but the fact that it's so cheap overrides all of them. The price for AYCE lunch is $11.99 (they may have increased it to $12.99 recently), but lunch hour is until 5pm! It's a small restaurant and it gets very busy around 12-2pm, but the wait usually isn't long. It's walking distance from my university (which is why I come so often), and also from Yonge & Dundas, Eaton Centre, and College Station.

The buffet selection is quite poor, but what do you expect for that price? Whatever they do have is pretty delicious! They don't have sashimi, but they have pretty darn good chicken teriyaki. Dessert options are green tea, red bean, and vanilla ice cream (no deep fried banana) and drinks aren't included. If you need to satisfy a sushi craving, this is the place to go to get delicious AYCE at a low price and fast service."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal. All you can eat sushi at dinner for $21.99. Wine was only $4.95. Dragon roll was excellent, crab was great and the usual tuna, salmon, tempura offerings. Very close to the Doubletree by Westin. Would go again."}
{"text":"Holy crap :)

Kay, lunch ayce is shit. Limited selection, not that good. I was refusing to come to Kyoto house because I had their lunch ayce twice. But my partner wanted me to trust him on the dinner ayce. And you know what, I ate my words.

Dinner ayce, soo good. I'm all about the Kalbi and sashimi. Sashimi is decently fresh. The rolls are nice with good rice to fish ratio. The Kalbi... Mmm... The Kalbi. 

You are amazing. Ilu"}
{"text":"I usually go to kyoto house for ayce lunch. They offer the basic sushi, rolls, and cooked foods. Their price is comparable with other sushi place on downtown, and it's also the cheapest ayce lunch $13.99 (from what I know) in Toronto. 

Their sushi and rolls are good, not VERY yummy or too bad either. I like their fish to rice ratio. The only complaint I have is their white tuna, sometimes it's with a weird color and you know it's not fresh. 

Service is quick. Good for lunch break and sushi cravings. However there is a lineup during peak times, but the wait time is not that long."}
{"text":"This is a good place if you just want a quick bite of all you can eat sushi at a very reasonable price. Quality wise, you get what you paid for, but still tasty nonetheless! Even for the lunch special, you still get a wide variety of sushi. Definitely recommend if you're craving sushi and don't feel like breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"I think that giving it 1 star is even giving them too much. Their service is appalling. Yes, they do give very affordable prices for an AYCE place. But the fine print is don't expect anything else but the food shoved on your tables. 

First of all. It was lunch time but we ordered with the dinner menu cause we wanted sashimi. They allowed and just gave us the menu. Oh sorry, \"dropped\" the menu on table. When we were ready to order and give the slip, they just took it rather hastily and left. Didn't even ask us if we wanted drinks or anything. And by the way, it took us forever to get water. 

Second. Not everything we ordered arrived. We already paid for the dinner menu. The pricier one. Yet it wasn't complete. Wasn't that why we ordered the dinner menu right?!? To have the selection! 

Third. Since we ordered sashimi, we got salmon and butter fish. We were served the belly portion of the salmon. You could tell cause the fat lining was there. Any Japanese place knows that the belly should be stripped off because well.... you don't serve that as sashimi. The quality wasn't great either. It fell apart and smelled fishy, not the freshest. And please, serve cold food on cold plates and hot food on hot plates. It's simple food safety. 

Fourth and most abhorring. Food was just being SHOVED ON OUR TABLE. Even when my friend was selecting items on the menu, someone just comes and shoves the soy dishes and condiments on the table AND ON HIS PAPER WHILE HE WAS WRITING. No regard for respect. As food was coming in, they just kept thrusting and shoving plates on the table. Not once did they say \"excuse me\". So, in my annoyance, when the server shoved it again I said \"next time please say excuse me!\". You know what, the next plate that came, the server MOCKINGLY yells \"Exxxcccuussseee meee!\" RUDE. 

And OBVIOUSLY, none of them wore any name tags to save themselves. 

Now, my husband and I have been HAVING TUMMY PROBLEMS since yesterday afternoon. I'm guessing it's a combination of all things gone wrong. If $5 more dollars will get you a little more respect and a little hospitality, I'll take it and just eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch looking for a cheap AYCE meal.  You pretty much get what you pay for here.

The food itself was not that good.  The rolls were very mushy and didn't taste like anything special.  The selection for lunch is very limited and whatever you do order isn't executed that well.   I was pretty disappointed by the food.

The service was lacking in my opinion.  Food came within 10-20 minutes, which was not bad, but the waitresses rarely came by for anything else.  I asked for water twice, and got some finally when I asked again.  I felt like I was being ignored by the servers through my whole meal.  The atmosphere also wasn't very special; you really just come to this place to get all-you-can-eat for a relatively cheap price, that's it.

Overall, while I did pay $5 less for what I'd usually pay for AYCE sushi, it was not worth it.  I'd rather fork up an extra bill to double my selection and have much better service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"For a $20.99 dinner price, this restaurant is likely the best priced AYCE sushi place in downtown Toronto. It's not one of the big franchises in the area which offers coziness and persona to the visit. Wait staff was quick and attentive on tea refills. Orders were collected and filled in a timely manner. The sashimi was so fresh. I was especially happy with the butterfish, which is something I don't normally order. They did miss a few things on our order - bulgogi and kurage - but everything that arrived was delicious. For larger parties, there is a party room in the back if you call ahead. Overall, this was a great experience. The food and price will have me coming back."}
{"text":"$13.99 for lunch all you can eat sushi is the best price I've seen anywhere in downtown Toronto. Place was almost full for Saturday lunch which tells you it's a good deal. The menu is a little shorter than other ayce restaurants but they have most of the essentials (sushi, rolls, hot dishes). The sushi is comparable to other ayce restaurants. Will definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"I may not be a sushi expert but I love Kyoto! My favorite place to go for sushi. They also have a great price for lunch all-you-can-eat. The mango rolls are a great dessert roll. The avocado tempura is definitely one of my favorite things there also."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after we were running late and we had just missed the lunch special at Spring Sushi down the street. Once we arrived we were quickly seated right by the door and given our lunch \"check off sheets\" there wasn't much variety which was disappointing however we decided we would make the most of it. We ordered a few items waved down our server and waited for our first wave of items to arrive. The place was very busy and I can assume it's because their lunch special runs until 5PM which is later than usual for most AYCE places. The server dropped off our tempura vegetables and a few sushi rolls..the tempura yam was RAW..I could not even get through eating one of them. Our sushi was nothing special and we actually waved down our server because what we got didn't look like what we had ordered, the server took back the item and 2 minutes later a very angry asian woman came back with our order form and said to us rudely \"IS THIS NOT YOUR WRITING?\" after that..everything went down hill. We were ignored the entire time, it took us 25 minutes to get our bill and that was after not receiving 50% of the things we had asked for. 

The service at this place is the worst I have ever in my life experienced. All the servers are running around frantically dropping items at peoples tables only for them to be told they didn't order that and then them having to bring it to another table. Not many of the servers speak english and not that, that is a big issue it's just hard to communicate when you need your bill. I was ready to walk out of that place as soon as I had walked in. We did not feel welcome at all and we will never ever reutrn."}
{"text":"Honestly, the place is a good and cheap ayce downtown. Of course the service is definitely not the best and the atmosphere is not cosy but what do you expect?! You're here to eat... 

We were 8 people and we were sat in a private room. The service is quick and the food is good. 

The menu is pretty average with the regular sushis and makis but nothing \"special\". Good portions and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"had a 12 hour work day and was looking for something close to the hotel for takeout.

kyoto was a block away and considering it was nearly 11pm, was quite busy. i looked at the food on the table and it looked okay.

i ordered a sashimi collection for $12 that was okay. just okay. 

and a crazy roll. 

both were okay. a little tasteless. the wasabi and ginger (which there was a decent portion of) and soy sauce helped a bit. perhaps i was way too tired to eat but i found it very bland. maybe i ordered the wrong things but i actually asked what the most popular rolls were and she said crazy roll was one of them.

also, sushi rice is usually a little sweet. this wasn't.

given the choices in the area i would rather try a different place next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for cheap AYCE sushi! Pretty busy place, but the restaurant is very specious and they set up the place to look really nice. Pretty standard AYCE sushi items, with pretty decent salmon and the ice cream was good too. My favourite sushi restaurant for the price and value."}
{"text":"Here at Kyoto House, food is great, and service is on point every time! I've been here twice - once with a group of 10+ people, and then with a group of 6. We were seated in one of the little rooms the first time, and while it's harder to get the server's attention while you're in there (there is no little call button), they checked on us fairly frequently, and made sure we were doing okay. Our food kept arriving fast, and the quality was great both times - generous cuts for the sashimi, and not too much rice on the rolls. Also, they had no problem accommodating the couple of people who went a la carte, while the rest of us ordered from the all you can eat menu. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"decent quality. cheap. meh service. full tummy."}
{"text":"I've had their AYCE lunch and dinner and it's definitely nothing to write home about.  It's the usual Chinese-run AYCE Japanese place, where the food is all very bland and lacking any kind of finesse.  This place further irks me by artificially sweetening their sushi soy sauce in an attempt to make their food taste better."}
{"text":"I like this place for an impulsive need for sushi. The portions are good for a buffet and the service is super quick. The sushi is nice and fresh, the rice is not too overdone and overstuffed. The main issue is the crowding and high volume. Especially as it is close to the bus stop, if you go on a Friday, you have tons of students with their bags and suitcases. But I have learned you can make a reservation even 30 minutes before, show up and be seated before the 20 other people waiting."}
{"text":"A stark contrast to the sushi restaurant just a few doors down.

We came here as a group for AYCE sushi dinner: $25/per person including tax and tip.

The quality is definitely not great, and they are definitely not legitimately Japanese (all of their staff speak Cantonese as far as I heard), but my friends wanted all you can eat--- which Japango does not offer. 

This place is always packed. The sushi that they serve just tasted cheap. Nothing really stood out, the quality is not top notch but it's not absolutely terrible. All the rolls fall apart and the cooked food arrived warm instead of hot. Instead of serving their udon in bowls, they serve them in dishes so you barely get any noodles. The chicken teriyaki is overcooked and dry, and every time we ordered beef ribs, they'd give us at least two pieces of just bone. However, I did like that they actually had Ika as an option on their sushi list, and they always gave us everything we ordered.

I don't think I'd come back here for AYCE, but I've had their bento boxes and they are not bad. I would come back if I was desperate for sushi and the good places were closed. It was definitely a 'meh' experience. 

BONUS: Their washrooms are really gross."}
{"text":"The ayce lunch menu barely has any items. They dont even have  vegetable or shrimp or crab tempura. Strongly not recommended."}
{"text":"The bar was low coming into this - dinner prices are cheaper than most other sushi restaurants ($20 VS $28 in most cases), and I knew the quality is not the greatest.

Selection is decent, but really you'd be better off focusing on the sashimi and dragon rolls - the eel rolls were pretty good as well. Take a chance with the tempura, though I found it to be heavily breaded, so you'll spend some time rubbing it off. Desert is limited to red bean and green tea ice cream, but if you're making good use of AYCE (which I hope you will) then that shouldn't cause you to worry. 

The atmosphere is average, staff are reasonably attentive, and service is fairly quick. We also didn't have to wait to be seated, which is a huge bonus compared to other sushi places in TO. I'd personally rather go to a higher quality sushi place, but if you don't really care, then give this place a chance."}
{"text":"My friends were having a little meet up and a get together at this restaurant and being someone who loves cheap AYCE Japanese, I couldn't say no! 

$11.99? Holy moly! YES PLEASE. The price of this place is great and I can't argue about that but the food quality is terrible. The sushi was way too moist and mushy. The sashimi was ok, I definitely had better. My only favourite dish would be the Fried Chicken Udon, it was good.

The service here is absolutely terrible. Even if we were students, we're still your customers. They don't even speak to you at all, all they do is give you grunts and stare at you but since it's your typical cheap run down AYCE sushi joint so I'll let that slide.

I definitely won't be back but $11.99 is a good price and hey, you get what you pay for, right."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for AYCE sushi lunch on Saturday or Sunday. I've found the sushi to be good for the AYCE format, the price is right, and the service is good. Food comes out quickly and what you tick you get. I easily tip 20%+ because normally AYCE service at other places is so horrendous, I really want to reward the ability to transport correct orders to correct tables.

But the difference between the day and night services is, well, night and day. They have more items on the dinner menu (for a higher price) including normal tuna (what the hell is white tuna anyway?) and sashimi. 

But the night staff are complete and utter retards. They messed up our order twice in a row, delivering our order to other tables, delivering other table's orders to us. The waitress seemed totally indifferent as to whether or not diners were getting what they ordered.

One of the rare times I counted out bills and coin to the penny and paid leaving 0 tip. Sorry, babes, you gotta give a flying f**k if you want your $9 tip."}
{"text":"The food is okay and reasonable price but the service was horrible. Some of them are nice but some are rude. We came for lunch in the cold day. The lady was taking the other 2 people after us instead of 2 of us for no reason. It took around 15 mins to get a seat, then 15 more mins to get the paper to order. We were asking then she threw the paper on the table without saying anything then walk away. At the end when we paid, she didn't forget to say \"you should pay for tips\", doesn't she know that she's not supposed to say that? I ended up with paying $1 for tips and getting an attitude from her. 
To be honest, I might come back with the quality of the food but to this service, no thanks!"}
{"text":"They sat us at a small table for two...When we requested one of the free booths we were told that they are only for 5 people, despite the fact that there were two other booths of the same size that had only two guests...We pointed out that fact, and were told the same thing again but in a very rude manner...The waitresses then proceeded to laugh in Japanese to one another...I can't really give a review of their food, because we walked out...However, I can say that their service horrible and I would never recommend coming here based on that fact alone ."}
{"text":"Came here before my sister's greyhound bus home as it's super close to the station and conveniently fast. Plus whenever I've walked past this place, it's always packed so I assumed it wouldn't be too shabby. The AYCE sushi lunch is cheap at $12.99 but after looking at the AYCE menu and the little selection, I opted for the salmon teriyaki bento box for $9.99. The AYCE menu didn't have my favourite appetizers such as salmon teriyaki, shrimp tempura, beef short ribs, beef skewers, cheese wonton, etc which is why I didn't get it. The selection was quite minimal in my opinion but I guess that's what you get for that price!

The sushi teriyaki was delicious but slightly overcooked. The miso soup was yummy! Salad and california roll with the dish was good as well and the portions were generous. The reason I'm giving this place 3/5 stars is because I wouldn't come here again due to the small AYCE lunch selection."}
{"text":"I ran in from the frigid Toronto winds last Friday night to meet some friends at this very busy student populated restaurant. My friends were already chowing down on massive quantities of AYCE food and if your starving, $17.99 definitely fits the bill. The food quality looked good but the maki looked like it had too much rice and was assembled too quickly. I ordered the chicken Tappanaki (white meat) dinner. For $12.99 I got miso soup, salad, a large sizzling plate packed with steamed veg and topped with a very generous portion of chicken breast and a bowl of steamed rice. It was all very tasty,  good presentation and the quality was definitely above the AYCE food. Overall my food experience was very good, the service was attentive and the atmosphere was what you'd expect.

I'd give this place 3.2*** but I'll round it up to help the low rating"}
{"text":"'All You Can Eat' is both the best and worst four words when describing a restaurant. The worst is of course how you feel after your meal of 5 pounds of food and knowing you still have to get home in this state. The best is that you feel this way because you just ate FIVE POUNDS of food! This is not the way of life at Kyoto Japanese House, however.

Now, I won't say I've never left with a stomach ache and have been hungry. This would be a lie. But the ongoing problem I've had in three visits here is that after your initial order of food, the service slows down quite noticeably. We're talking gaps of time where you wonder if the staff up and vanished on you and you're left sitting there playing air drums with your chop sticks. When the server does return they don't seem too happy you're ordering more and after the second round they just don't show up at all. Since there's a loose time limit of two hours they can ask you to leave after that, which is generally at the point you were thinking of leaving anyhow because you're sick of waiting for a waiter to show up. Considering it's $18.95 for dinner and by the end of it you've gotten around a large plate of food that would cost about 1/2 of that almost anywhere else, it's a bit of a snub to say the least.

Not bad food, just bad service"}
{"text":"For $13.99 all you can eat lunch, this place is just amazing. 

The rolls are fairly small which makes it less sickening compared to many of the other sushi places. The dynamite rolls are popping with flavour and the salmon sushi has a very smooth texture. The chicken teriyaki has the right amount of marinating and the service is fairly quick. 

When receiving the bill, \"Milkita\" candy is normally given, which comes in various flavours. For a student who has a tight budget, this is my go-to sushi place. Highly recommended to anyone who loves sushi and doesn't want to spend too much money."}
{"text":"Decent. Wouldn't really say it's anything special but you pay for what you get I guess. $13.99 lunch AYCE. The rolls are pretty small and lunch menu is limited. The shrimp tempura roll literally was just shrimp tempura. That was it. The eel had a lot of bones in it which made me feel uncomfortable to say the least... 

There's wifi and the service is fast at least. 

Will probably not come back unless a friend forces me to go."}
{"text":"They always seem to bring half our order for all-you-can-eat.
Always."}
{"text":"Kyoto House has been my go-to sushi place since high school. The prices used to be cheaper (11.99 for lunch and 18.99 for dinner) but they've raised the prices by $2. The sushi is not amazing, just decent. Service is really fast and they are all friendly. They have free wifi as well. Their tempura usually has too much tempura flour on it. They have a crispy roll that's my favourite thing on the menu. Not the place to go for high-quality sushi; just a place for your quick, cheap fix."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi place in downtown Toronto. Mostly because it's cheap, but the food is pretty good too! Word of warning: the service, although extremely efficient, sucks. So if you're looking to get pampered, this probably isn't the place for you. But if you're in the mood for good AYCE sushi at a discount, Kyoto's the place to be."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Poor execution and few items in the menu. For the same price you can easily find better all you can eat in downtown. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Kyoto House Japanese Restaurant is located directly on the south-west  corner of Elizabeth and Dundas amids a myriad of Asian eateries.  Besides very limited street parking (read: don't count on it), there are only expensive lots nearby (one just on the south-side of Bay).  Kyoto specializes in AYCE (All You Can Eat) Japanese food including sushi, rolls, and a small assortment of cooked food for $12 at lunch.  This forgettable, obesity-inducing, Japano-Clone offers bland dishes that barely scratch the surface for sushi craving customers.

Kyoto's decor is a waste of the otherwise ideal location, with large window frontage of both Elizabeth and Dundas.  A small sushi bar sits in the corner with square tables evenly distributed and configured in 4s and 6s throughout.  I honestly have very little recollection anything besides that.

For the AYCE lunch, you are presented with a small \"menu\" (a slip of paper) which you are to write numbers beside the items.  Most common items are present.  Salmon, red snapper, white tuna, \"crab\" and others are accounted for.  A small section of rolls also runs down the favorites like California, salmon, spicy crab, etc.  Finally the \"cooked\" section includes chicken teriaki, pork cutlet, dumplings (gyoza), Mizo soup, green salad and ice cream.  Not present are staples like shrimp tempura, hand-rolls, beef ribs, beef teriaki, and egg sushi (ebi?).

The Mizo was quite good as my co-worker had 3 bowls.  The salad was topped with a sweet white thousand-island like sauce which was interesting but not good.  The fried stuff came out next like the dumplings and spring rolls and they were a charred mess.  Next came the salmon sushi that was merely a blob of rice with a thin-cut deli-style sliver of salmon sitting on top.  Terrible.  

Service was laughable, with the \"waitress\" insisting that we we finish eating everything off our plates with no wastage.  We literally had 2 sushis left.  Needless to say there was no tip left for these angry, non-attentive, sour ladies.  Clearly the owners of this restaurant care little else than providing the lowest possible quality in volume and turning over as many customers as possible.

Why is it so hard to find a decently priced AYCE Japanese restaurant downtown?  North of the city they are plentiful and good.  Stay away from this appalling \"Japanese\" resaturant."}
{"text":"Pretty inexpensive for sushi. We split three rolls and 250mL of sake which totaled $40, so without the alcohol it would've been only ~$15 per person for a sushi dinner, which is reasonable. The fish skin in some of the rolls, such as the bbq salmon roll, boosted flavor."}
{"text":"Second visit to the restaurant I raved about... and I am not too sure. I was looking forward to the sashimi, and it came nice and chunky, but didn't taste fresh. 

Also, the floor was sticky and slippery and the seating was tight. I wonder if I am being picky, but it seems to me that the quality of the food and interiors altogether has dropped. Also, they seem to have increased the price by a dollar or two."}
{"text":"Umm... They forgot my order two times so that the food had served really slowly. My husband was a little annoyed. Most servers were not kind. Some of them was even rude, I think. Anyway, The quality of food was not bad."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi quality is good enough for me. I have had much worse sushi elsewhere. Service is a bit disorganized during the lunchtime peak but they are not exactly slackers though they are understaffed. They are constantly working their ass off so am not too upset by that. I still get my food without too much of a wait. I love the selection. My absolute favourite is their PHILADELPHIA SUSHI. AH-MA-ZING. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered tasted between good-delicious and fish seemed fresh. The rolls weren't the most beautiful I've seen but not to the point to fall apart, so considering they tasted good, arrived fast, price is cheap and the fish-rice proportion was pretty ok, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we go and have dinner here one night during the weekday. Considering he lived close and liked the joint. 

Personally myself I found that their rolls were really too small. We ordered quite a few different special rolls and they came out to be pinch as hell. I really should've gotten a picture, but just take my word it didn't please me one bit. It's not the best all you can eat sushi I've had but it sure wasn't the worst either. 

Service was alright couldn't complain, I got my food in a prompt time. I just wish they gave bigger portions."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst sushi places i've ever been too. My white tuna tasted like rubber and the tuna on my rainbow roll was not fresh. The korean bbq ribs were undercooked and the quality of the fish was just terrible."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday morning around 11:30am and it was packed by noon. The server was very rude. I ordered a Seafood Udon which came with miso soup and salad(drenched in mayonnaise?). I found plastic wrap in my udon. Disgusting! Terrible service and horrible discovery in my food. Would rate this place 0 if I could. Definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"Went in for the AYCE lunch ($14.99) and had an awesome experience! Food was great and service was pretty good. Orders came quickly and all the food tasted really good! Only thing is we never received our hand rolls but not really a big deal. New favourite AYCE sushi place! Cheap, great food, good menu, and lunch goes till 5!! 
-we also got candy with the bill :)

Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for the AYCE lunch on a weekday. I should mention that this wasn't my choice; Japango was full. Anyways, restaurant was busy but no line. Menu was simple and straightforward, offering most of the options you'd expect to see. The menu is slightly more limited than a lot of the larger Japanese AYCE restaurants that you find in the 'burbs these days, so if you're used to that, you might be disappointed. 

In terms of food quality, this is basically the poor man's sushi place.  There was nothing wrong with the flavour of the food; it was perfectly passable. But if you were to critique the sushi, you can quite easily tell that it is cheaply and crudely made, even for an AYCE place. The rolls aren't overstuffed with rice, so that's good news, but there's no reason for the sushi to look more poorly made than some of the food court sushi that I've had. Everything looks haphazardly thrown together. In terms of ingredient freshness, it's ok: not terrible, but certainly not great either. If you don't mind these things and just want to stuff yourself at a relatively low cost, this place might just do the trick.

Service is quick but otherwise there's nothing commendable. Cleanliness continues to be an issue."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been able to find in Toronto so far. Not only is it all you can eat, the food is fresh and clean and well prepared. The temperature of the fish is perfect as well as the thickness of the cut and the amount of fat in each piece of fish. I was also impressed by the amount of rice that they put in each piece it wasn't overwhelming. The Taste is especially delicious. My friend and I have now booked this is our favorite place to go for sushi. 

The wait times weren't very long either. It didn't take long for us to already start eating which was great since we were hungry after shopping.

The price is decent as far as all you can eat sushi goes."}
{"text":"Next time you're near City Hall or Eaton Centre save an empty stomach to try Kyoto House at lunch. They do not offer top notch Japanese cuisine, but they will satisfy any sushi cravings at a very good price. 

Once you step in their doors, know that there is no going back. You have now committed your face to be stuffed, and a waistline to grow beyond your wildest dreams.

The place is small, there will be a wait for seats, but the wait should be brief. Everyone working there are systematic efficient machines.  Orders are very quick to come, and order sheets will keep coming. Chefs all have magical fingers pumping out sushi like a factory chain. And your role will simply be to eat and eat and eat.

Kyoto House will show you the amazing ability of your belly to expand. Your stomach will be screaming \"No more food!\" Your mind will scream back \"more more mooreee!!!\"

With belts on looser, bellies weight down bigger and lower, after Kyoto House, you will want to throw your arms up in success. You may vow to never put your body through this again. But once your next sushi craving strikes, you will without a doubt go back to Kyoto House for more."}
{"text":"The sushi all you can eat is definitely priced low but not for what they serve you. The waiters are rude.. they want you to get out as soon as possible. the Sushi isnt cooked that well.. half the time the rice is falling off the roll.. clearly they arent trained that well.. they serve the sushi really carelessly.. you have to keep asking them for water and drinks.. its jam packed because if its price but dont go here if you are planning a nice date.. its just a place to go when you are low on money and want to have average sushi and sashimi.. Spring sushi is just 6 dollars more for dinner and have a muchhh better service and taste!!"}
{"text":"Kyoto House is very cheap, but it's cheap for a reason-- the food is atrocious. 

My friend and I came in for dinner at 6.45 on a Thursday evening, and the place was empty except for a table of two other people. We had to stand there for several minutes while the waitresses were chatting at the sushi bar, and it wasn't until the only non-Asian waitress saw us after she came out of the back that we were seated. My friend and I both did the AYCE, and we were expecting somewhat decent things.

We ordered every roll on the menu to sample, as well as the squid sushi, egg sushi, and tofu pockets. The food that was passable was the california roll, the seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, the tofu pockets, the egg sushi, and... that was it. Everything else was terrible: the salmon and squid were SLIMY, the avocado was brown in everything, the spicy mayo tasted off, and the rice was warm and falling off the rolls. To make things worse, there were insects all over the walls :( One got on my hand while I was pouring myself some soy sauce, and I was startled so I spilled soy sauce all over the table.

We were feeling extremely queasy after just a few pieces of sushi, so we paid our bill and left before the sushi pizza made its way to our table. I would never go back to this place because it was filthy, 6 out of the 8 waitresses on staff that night were rude and inattentive, and the sushi was just not fresh at all. I didn't feel well the rest of the night and into the next morning, it's not worth it. There are cheap AYCE lunches elsewhere in the GTA that are better value. I am genuinely so upset that we paid 50 dollars for this crap.

The only reasons I'm giving this place one star is because the South Asian or South East Asian waitress who served us when everyone else ignored us was the nicest woman ever."}
{"text":"For what it's worth, I think Kyoto House is a good establishment considering the surrounding area is filled with students and youth attending universities. If you're looking for top of the line Japanese food, then obviously this isn't gonna be your place, but if you're on a budget, one shouldn't be picky on what food they eat. And personally I feel Kyoto House satisfies that criteria very well.

I went to Kyoto House for lunch AYCE as a farewell for one of my coworkers' last day in my department. She wasn't interested in a fancy lunch place, so we settled on this since it's cheap ($12.99), fill you up place. The lunch menu isn't too extensive, but it does cover most of the AYCE staples. Do note sashimi is only for dinner; only sushi is available for lunch.

We had several sushis and rolls including salmon sushi, surf clam sushi, octopus sushi, tobiko sushi, white tuna sushi, tofu skin sushi, philadelphia rolls, tokyo rolls, and some more rolls that I forgot. Honestly considering the presentation of the rolls/sushi (lacklustre at best), the food was not bad. For a $12.99 buffet the selections weren't terrible, and again if you're into the more exotic items you wouldn't be dining here in the first place.

Service was a little rushed, but I did expect that considering the establishment settings of this place. Most employees are students and many speak mandarin, so no it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant. We still got catered to for the most part, although we never got our tea filled once.

Also note: This restaurant is actually quite strict in terms of wasted food. You will be charged extra if you leave too much rice behind. We saw another table that got extra money charged to their meal for leaving waste behind, so I figure I'd give this warning out.

Otherwise...if you're in for cheap, fill you up AYCE buffet, this place fits your needs. If not, then needless to say look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to Kyoto Japanese restaurant only once for lunch and it will be the last one for sure. 

Any sushi lover should stay clear of this place. The sushi rice is odd and the fish is not as fresh as other sushi restaurant in the area. The lunch menu is extremely limited and there is not much to choose from. The food is worth 2 stars but I decided to give it 3 stars simply because the price is so low (12.99$ for AYCE lunch) and because they are opened for LUNCH until 5pm, which is hard to find. 

The restaurant was awful crowded but the service was fast and friendly. 

I would suggest Kyoto only if you are nearby and not looking to spend more than 12.99& for a sushi lunch."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost. The sashimi they serve us is one of the worst  i ever tried. The place is not even clean. Last time i went with my friends, we found out that the table was sticky. They didn't even bother to clean it, so we end up cleaning the table. Also the waitress was kinda rude. They  kept forgetting our order. And it always took a long time for them to come to our table. WE had to reorder stuffs that didn't come to us."}
{"text":"Se você está com vontade de um rodízio japonês mas está sem dinheiro. Aqui é seu lugar.
Mas não crie muitas expectativas, a comida é boa, normal, nada demais. Mas vale a pena porque é bem barato. \"All you can eat\" (como eles chamam o rodízio em inglês) é por volta de 13 dólares (nov/2015).
Se você for no almoço, chegue cedo (por volta do meio dia), pois o restaurante fica lotado e com filas de espera.
Quanto ao serviço, relaxe e respire fundo. Porque são bem desatentos e grossos com quem não é oriental."}
{"text":"I have been here many times! I prefer the dinner all you can eat sushi because of one and only thing, SASHIMI! It's $19 for dinner and for all you can eat sushi and sashimi it is well worth it! They have a good selection of the popular sushis such as red and green dragon and my personal favourite the shrimp tempura sushi!

Their lunch menu however is a little weaker, makes sense since lunch costs less as well, around $13. The good thing is even during lunch hours you can ask for the dinner menu, which in my opinion will be the best $6 upgrade. Specially if you compare it to Spring Sushi by the Dundas square whose lunch ayce menu does not include sashimi and is $16.50."}
{"text":"My school is located fairly close to this place, hence I come here quite often - before I found out about their roach infestation!!! I swear to god, never again am I coming back to this place. 

I was seated near the cashier area the last time I went and I was appalled at the lack of hygiene this place has. There were about 5 cockroaches (alive) near the sushi bar area and they were running around! The waiters there act as if nothing unusual is happening and began kicking them around while they were bringing out food from the kitchen. 

No wonder this place is so cheap and lunch hour extends from 11:30 - 5:00pm, they serve us dirty food. If the restaurant is this dirty, I cannot begin to imagine how disgusting their kitchen really is. I am going to try uploading the roach picture that I've taken while I was dining in."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a large group (I did not pick the venue!). I was wary after reading the bad yelp reviews. A lot of reviews are old, so I was hoping this place has improved or stepped up their game. Sadly, the food was mediocre at best. I am generally not an AYCE fan because it is always about quantity over quality and it shows. It's not their fault even. For prices that low (lunch is $15 including tax), it would be impossible to source good ingredients. But this place was \"meh\", even compared to other AYCE places. The standard roles were okay, but the other stuff (e.g. gyoza, yakiudon, chicken terriyaki) looked very sad. 

Furthermore, the service was disorganized and one server spilled a cup of hot tea on my friend!! We were scared to ask for more tea after that! Finally, there was a stack of those little dishes where you put the soy sauce. Half of them were not clean, they had weird bits of food or who knows what crusted onto them and we had to ask for new ones. Really?? 

Yes, this place is fast and cheap, but it's really not worth it. You can do so much better for sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"I usually rarely review but this place needs to be shut down. When I got there after ordering sushi and the house wine I decided to hit the restroom. The bathroom was disgusting, with water everywhere and a strong smell of urine.  Walking back to my seat I noticed several food violations. The sushi chief was cutting chicken on the higher counter and blood was dripping down the high counter to a lower counter with an open bottle of mayonnaise. Another chief was scratching his head under his hat and the preparing the salmon.

I explained this to the waitress but rather than any kind of assurment I was told \"okay\" as she walked away and continued serving other guests. I payed the bill and left......never to come back."}
{"text":"Kyoto House is actually my go-to AYCE sushi place downtown. What I like about the restaurant is that it's a no-fuss place. You come in, you order and the food comes before you know it. For me, the dinner price of $19.99 is worth it if you eat sashimi. The lunch price is the best value at $11.99 (no sashimi though). They don't offer sushi pizza for AYCE but that's really the only dish I care for and wish they carry.

I would recommend ordering anything \"crunchy\" on the menu and if you're not sure about the sushi order, get the hand roll instead of the 6pcs set. I order a lot on the first round and they usually get our orders right. Usually it depends on who our server is. Some of them are quicker and more capable - I guess it depends on your luck but that's really about the same in any restaurant.

The other bonus for me is they have free Wi-Fi. 

If you're looking to get food fast and be really full (or you're eating solo), I really recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"I couldn't disagree with Tammy's review more. What an amazing find. Staying at the Met downtown I wandered past this little sushi joint on the corner. I have to admit that I was a little scared. I've eaten sushi all over the US and Canada and I've been to all you can eat sushi in Vancouver, and even there the places are hit and miss. 

It was getting quite late so we decided to take the risk and went into Kyoto House Japanese Restaurant to give it a try. We couldn't be more pleased!!! 

Everything is MADE TO ORDER! 

The Tempura was fresh, light and flaky and better than about 90% of tempura that I have ordered in the past (let me tell you, that is a lot!). The had the Salmon Sashimi and it was so fresh, melty and buttery -- it drove me crazy!!! I got three more orders (both yesterday and when I went back today!) 

Oh, I feel like I am betraying my favorite Korean restaurants when I say this... but the Beef Short ribs?! SO DARN GOOD. The Teriyaki sauce for the chicken is made \"in house\", but I prefer white meat (the chicken is a mixture) so my best friend enjoyed this more. Miso is traditional -- and all of the rolls (both hand roll, and sushi rolls we tried did not disappoint). Spider, Dragon, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura? Check Check Check!! 

The staff was friendly, fast and attentive. English is a second language, but they keep the food coming, even when you are ordering a mixture of fresh, raw, cooked and rolls. 

I haven't tried the lunch menu, it's much simpler. I would pay the extra few dollars and opt for dinner. It's worth it! 

I will go back, I can't help myself... and I can't wait to take my other best friend here. For under a $20 price tag, how could I ever say no!?"}
{"text":"For the cost and location, I thought as a AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi place, it was pretty decent. I went on a Saturday night and had the all you can eat menu. I took a look at the other options, and the prices are pretty cheap, but we were craving a lot of sashimi. The sashimi wasn't the fresh-est, but it was decent and you could order as much as you want. The sashimi came in very small pieces, but I don't see this as a big deal since it's all you can eat. So here are some likes and dislikes of what I ordered:

Liked:
Salmon sashimi, kalbi ribs (kind of fatty but very tasty!), tempura shrimp (came out hot and fresh!), miso soup, BBQ eel sushi

Disliked:
Green tea ice cream (tasted like it was old?), spider maki rolls had WAY too much rice on it (leaving you too full to eat anything else!)

Selection for AYCE wasn't the greatest. Lacking on the menu was a choice of udon soups (there was only 1 choice), no seaweed salad, nor any other special items you can find at better AYCE places, like beef sashimi, oysters, etc.

The Verdict
I would come here again if I was REALLY hungry for sashimi and tempura. Otherwise, Japango next door serves up much tastier and fresher sushi, albeit with a bigger price tag."}
{"text":"We were searching for a decent all you can eat sushi, and just decided to try this one out. What attracted us was the price - only $11.99 for lunch. Also from outside, it seemed like a popular place to have AYCE, as most tables were occupied with people of all races. The place is nicely decorated and there is booth seating.

Kyoto House is Chinese owned, as with many AYCE places. With AYCE places, waitresses easily get impatient at customers or stressed out due to how busy it gets, thus creating bad service. This may be because we were a group of young looking teenagers, but the service we experienced was below average. The waitresses frequently rolled their eyes at us whenever we tried to get their attention to take our order sheet, or reminded them of our forgotten food (The chefs forgot or completely ignored 2 of our hand roll orders, and we had to inform the waitresses while staring at her annoyed face). The food came pretty quick though.

Looking at their AYCE menu - they actually do not have a lot of variety, although they do have the essentials - sushi rolls, sashimi, hand rolls, tempura, chicken/pork cutlet, fried dumplings, ramen, miso soup. The quality of food is average, not spectacular, but not terrible either. 

Overall an okay atmosphere for having a good meal, although not a large selection."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. 

I've been here twice. The first time was 3 years ago for dinner service & everything was meh. There's a reason why I hadn't been back for awhile. But recently I went with a group of 5 and we came right when they opened. Really glad this experience was better. The fish to rice ratio was really great for both sushi & [especially] the rolls. Actually the piece of white tuna in the roll filled up the entire centre! The spicy crunch salmon, tempura roll, Philadelphia roll, spicy white tuna roll, eel & salmon skin roll were all tasty. Again the rice ratio was great, it was a single thin layer of rice on the seaweed which means you can taste the filling better. 

Only thing I would like to complain about is the small menu for the lunch AYCE. 

Anyways, it's safe to say that my second experience was way better than first. Although a part of me wonders if it was by fluke chance or the fact that we came right when it opened & everything was fresher etc."}
{"text":"For $11.99 AYCE lunch on a weekend, you really can't complain. I was hesitant trying out this restaurant because I saw some pretty unappetizing pictures on Yelp. However, everybody has a different experience, right? Luckily for me, I didn't see anything I shouldn't see at this restaurant.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki and it was a bit on the dry and tough side. We also had spicy salmon roll (I almost couldn't handle the spiciness level), crunchy spicy salmon roll, avocado and eel roll (it was drizzled in a delicious sweet sauce) and salmon sushi. The salmon sashimi looked fresh in my opinion and we didn't get sick after eating it. We also got Philadelphia roll which was a miss at this restaurant. I couldn't resist getting a yam tempura, some gyoza and I got one avocado tempura to try since you don't see it at many restaurants. I have to say that their fried dishes were done very well. They only had two types of ice cream for dessert so we both got green tea ice cream and it was very good.

If you're looking for quality sushi, then this is not the place for you. However, if you just want to satisfy your sushi craving for cheap, then this is the stop for you."}
{"text":"The pricing for all you can eat is good considering it's downtown; however I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for quality sushi. The consistency of the quality of their sashimi is different everytime I went. But for the price, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Let me say I was a fan but nowadays I don't go there no more after realizing that it gets way to packed especially on a Friday Night, Waitresses keep on coming every 30 secs asking what you wanna drink and if you're with your plate, and they have a problem when it comes to fruit flies and whatever bugs you see flying around. But I've realized that they raise the price for All You Can Eat just by $1 more."}
{"text":"This is a good place if you want decent quality AYCE downtown and not pay a lot. The interior is a little run down looking, however the service and staff were great."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch sushi, party of 7.

The food here is average, but the price is good. This is the place to go if you want cheap AYCE sushi and you don't want to spend the entire meal eating rolls filled with rice. For $13.99 AYCE, that's pretty good since I think this place has better value than some of the AYCE sushi locations in Markham that charge more at lunch.

The menu is short and simple, there aren't any special rolls on the lunch menu. But they do have all the basic rolls that you expect (eg. salmon avocado, philadelphia, eel rolls, various sushis). The filling to rice ratio is good. The presentation is very poor, you can tell everything is thrown together with minimum effort, sushi rolls come out unevenly rolled and fried items are all tossed together randomly in a basket and served. But, the expectations are low and their customer base doesn't care.

We had a room in the back and found that service was generally lacking. The food was prepared very quickly and came to us quickly, but it was difficult getting water, or to submit an order. They were eager to take our next order at every step, so they could rush us out the door for the next customer.

They take credit card, no cash discount."}
{"text":"Went there on a weeknight for AYCE sushi dinner and it was great! No wait, seated immediately, it did get a bit busy while we were there but the service continued to be great.
 I love spicy crab rolls and there's were definitely satisfying. 
The service there was great never had to wait very long for the food or to reorder. Presentation was alright, am neutral not bad not great, but I didn't plan on anything fancy just a lot of food. 

The yam tempura roll was also great, tried so many things I can't remember them all but all rolls were great as well as the Katsu don's. 
The names of some of the rolls confused me as at other places I have been to they meant different things but not a big deal.
I will go back again. I don't know what people are saying about the poor service didn't have any issues while we were there. Hopefully never do."}
{"text":"The sushi broke a lot because it wasn't sticky enough. No ginger to come with the sushi. Some orders were missing as well. No shrimp tempera for lunch :("}
{"text":"Really slow service even though we were the first people there and the only people for about half an hour and then it got busy. I found some bones in my eel avocado roll... ugh. Crab and salmon rolls and sushi was really good, everything kept falling apart though. We had the AYCE lunch, me and my boyfriend and it was a total of $27.10. Will be coming back every now and then."}
{"text":"No variety on the AYCE. Ingredients are of poor quality. Inattentive waiters. Japango was closed and I was forced to dine here."}
{"text":"So if you are hungry and have only $15 ... This place is for you. Dont go for quality or presentation or ambiance or service or cleanliness or choice or conversation."}
{"text":"Brutally bad sushi for the unemployed and broke students.   There's is no reason to eat food this awful.   I can't think of a single item that was even decent.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place definitely is good but food comes extremely fast. I ordered Salmon sashimi it had multiple bones in it so be careful!"}
{"text":"As an avid sushi-eater, this restaurant is by far one of the worst sushi restaurants I have ever been to. It appears to be packed everytime I pass by so I decided to give it a try and I was very disappointed.

I was fine with the fact that the restaurant was packed with hungry students, enjoying their AYCE sushi and even the fact that walk to the restroom was somewhat fishy-smelly and floor-greasy. However, when our order finally came out, my appetite just slowly submerged into the puddle of water under their sashimi plate. 

-Tempura was literally battered too many times and it was very oily that I had to peel off the batter.
-Green salad had very sweet tasting white sauce which was watery and unpleasant. (half of the salad bowl was filled with this watery white sauce that was too sweet)
-Sashimi looked horrible. They just cut it in anyway they want, placed it however they wanted, salmon was mushy and very light orange colour, butterfish had this black spots in them, there was puddle of water underneath the sashimi plate, all sashimi tasted unusually slimy which is NOT what it's supposed to taste like.
-Beef rib was done too rare, I do like my beef somewhat tender and medium cooked, but you don't need to make ribs this rare!
-Rolls was made without any effort. Spider roll in partcular had this terrible rotten smell (reminded me of my walk to their washroom) to it and it just didn't taste right, we  just had to stop eating there..I have tried many spider rolls from various sushi places and this did not taste like soft shell crab to me. My friend almost threw up and she was gagging!

After trying each of these dishes for about 10 minutes, we decided that we could not eat any of their food anymore. We didn't care if we had to pay for food that we barely ate but our appetite was just thrown out the door. We called up our waitress and told her that we couldn't possibly eat anymore. After long discussion of her trying to justify herself by saying how everyone else is enjoying it and no one else is complaining, we still did not get an apology from her for us being dissatisfied with our experience at their restaurant. We asked her to try the food for herself and she won't. Perhaps their food on typical days are good but what if this particular dish we had was bad for some reason? She should have at least tried it and she would have known what we meant.

This is my first time having to stop eating at any restaurant due to their bad quality of food. I normally eat anything and everything and tend to enjoy food more than typical people, but this was just wrong. 

The owner/manager still didn't apologize, or offered to make us new dishes, but at least didn't make us pay for the little food we had. 

I love sushi.. but for now, I need a lil break after this experience."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE. Rolls were mushy, I swear some of it was microwaved (the dragon roll). The white tuna had a strange gritty texture to it and was super watery. The chicken udon came without chicken and was just a pile of stir-fried udon on a plate. Every dish was sub-par.

And in the end, it costed over $20 a head.

Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I recommend this place for lunch and dinner too.For lunch who is fun of crunchy,fried dishes this is best place rather than to go to fast-food restaurant.There is crunchy avocado ,that's my favourite,gyoza(dumpling) not bad,etc. As Torontonian I tried most of the AYCE but this place is best in terms of price and quality.
But Notice from me to everyone who prefer take-out, never buy Take-out from AYCE restos !"}
{"text":"This place is always good for a quick lunch for AYCE. As a student the cheap $12.99 really does help us broke students enjoy sushi :)"}
{"text":"Like most all-you-can-eat sushi places, total disappointment.

They use the lowest quality fish, rice seasoning is dull, they mix water to their soy sauce to save money....

No need for a review, just stay away."}
{"text":"For the price it was an okay sushi nothing special. There are better quality and better priced sushi in other places.Only good thing is that its chinese style serving which means just call a waiter loudly if you need something, but necessarily liked by others. Waiters should be nicer though. Crowd was mostly young school kids."}
{"text":"Great meal here on Friday night, we were contemplating between Kyoto and Japango and decided on Kyoto.

The good....
- Food is delicious and quite fresh
- Food comes QUICK
- large inside so seating is no issue

The bad..
- Service is mediocre at best, servers really can care less if you get the right order or not.
- they have a 1.5 hour limit on seating....come on!
- charge for wasted food
- portions are teeny tiny and you need to keep requesting sheets for order.
- inside the state of the place is frightening, looks like renos weren't done since 90s
- no condiments on the table...wtf?
- heavy on the rice dishes and the rolls contain tons of rice so you feel full quick

Experience was good but it's likely not going to become a go to."}
{"text":"Gross. My sushi looked like an abortion. It didn't taste fresh. Service was surly and abrupt. Best avoided."}
{"text":"Menu is large with the all you can eat. Good quality and service is generally quick. I've gone there many times. 
Only down side is that it can be very busy with lots of big groups coming in making it tough to find seating in short time. Otherwise, food is great and i always enjoy my trip there."}
{"text":"I give them five stars because:

1) service is fast
2) food is delicious
3) variety of foods available
4) located around the most priciest sushi joints downtown
5) CHEAP
6) REASONABLE PRICINGS
7) AFFORDABLE
8) they give milkshake candies
9) cute for dating or catching up with friends

Thats all"}
{"text":"Safe bet for all you can eat sushi at decent lunch time rate."}
{"text":"The service here is awful but the sushi, rice, sashimi is the freshest in the GTA. I make a special trip downtown at least once a month to eat here."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after work on a weekday. The most outstanding quality to us was the service. It was extremely fast: we got our food within minutes of putting our order in. The food quality is passable, but is reasonable for the price. The waitress did forget a couple of our orders, but we didn't really mind since it was all-you-can-eat. Would definitely recommend for those with a huge appetite and not so huge budget."}
{"text":"Food is cheap with the AYCE (all you can eat) menu being a little small but what they do have there tastes amazing. The salmon is very fresh and the rice is warm and melts in your mouth. I would not be surprised if they make their rice out of sugar or something since it is very good. 

I waited for a while before I got my Yam Tempura (they don't seem to have shrimp tempura for some reason.) and I would recommend you pass on that item. Did not taste good at all. The rest is great and the price is great too. 

The bad reviews I see are mostly about the service. Basically this place is always packed so they are always in a rush to get everything done. Don't take their ultra efficiency as being rude, they are just a little understaffed. I gave a smile to the staff and they smiled back. That is all it takes. As for the rush. Don't let them rush you, enjoy and try not to think of the many hungry people standing behind you drooling."}
{"text":"Absolutely garbage service! When my review starts off with that you KNOW this place has got to have the worst service ever. I mean, our server was rolling her eyes before she even got to our table. Honestly, these servers roll their eyes everywhere, it's like a requirement to work here. I've never seen so many eyes look at the ceiling it was like they were looking for something, their attitude was HORRIBLE.

But onto the review, firstly the food. The food is what you consider CRAP sushi. This place is AYCE and the only thing I can probably praise it for is the price and speed. They are quite speedy with the food so you don't have to wait that long and the price is quite cheap for lunch only $13 per person including tax and it is all you can eat so eat at your heart's desire. The first thing you can notice when you eat sushi however is the temperature of it. The rice was warm, the fish was not that fresh and the soya sauce was diluted. There are no special rolls and the presentation does not look nice either. The sushi is of low grade and the majority of it is warm so unless you like hot sushi then don't expect anything good here.

The service. Did I mention the service before a paragraph ago? Oh, I don't remember because I don't remember even HAVING service when we were eating here. Honestly, I have quite a high tolerance when it comes to service since I am used to going to chinese places to eat but the service here is ABYSMAL. You are treated like donkeys, servers never smile and their eyes are glued the ceiling. They literally threw our plates and chopsticks on the table I was so tempted to throw it back at them. You get better service eating at McDonalds.

The place does get quite busy but do not get fooled by the number of people, the sushi is of low grade and the service is absolutely disgusting I feel ashamed to be Chinese coming here. The only reason why so many people come here is because they are craving sushi and there are no all you can eat places around the area. My opinion? Save your money, go over to salad king and eat a nice meal rather than stuffing yourself with crappy warm sushi and suffering through the brigade of evil rude eye rolling waitresses. Ever coming here again? NO."}
{"text":"the first time i was here with a group of very talkative friends and I thought everything was delicious!
 I liked it enough to actually go back by myself for a second visit.  I realized everything tasted below average and sugary.... 
 
I guess the first time i was too distracted to notice the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Came here last night with two of my friends. It was very packed and busy but we got a table very quickly. If you are looking for a quick sushi fix and are not too picky, this place is to go to. For dinner on a Tuesday night, it cost around 20.99 per person, they are super old school with the paper menus, made me miss the IPAD system of ordering the food and instantly getting our food without any interaction or miscommunication from the waitress. With the paper menu, we had to flag her down, wait on her several times for a new sheet but when she did put our order in, food came out super quickly.

The restaurant had a different vibe than most of the sushi place that I have been to. This one was super crowded with small wooden wall dividers to separate us from the people sitting beside us. The washroom was in decent shape, nothing really stood out to me-it's exactly what you paid for. All you can eat sushi dinner in the busiest night of downtown Toronto. 

I would definitely come here again. The prices were great and the sushi was amazing. I was super surprised that all you could eat dinner included the premium sushi rolls like spider roll, dragon roll, and rainbow rolls. There were some places that were more expensive and did not have these rolls. Anyways, these were the best tasting rolls ever. All the sushi was delicious and fresh. The only thing that was okay was the spring roll. That is my only complaint about the food. Everything was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends had a reservation so we got put in a room. It was nice being sectioned off from the rest of the diners but service was horrible. Hardly anyone checked in, we had to go out and call a waitress everytime. No tea, water was just plain tap water at room temperature, and sushi was okay."}
{"text":"3 stars about hits it. Sushi quality was so-so... That said, it's what one would come to expect in paying 11.99 CAD for all you can eat. That's a great deal and if your smart about it- you can eat up like 50 dollars worth of food. Words of advice, the fried avocado is out of this world good, calamari is good.- the rolls are decent not great. The sashimi is perfect. The miso soup is watered down. But again, great joint for middle of the road sushi at excellent prices"}
{"text":"Despite the not so great reviews on Yelp, my boyfriend and I tried to the lunch all you can eat sushi here and we were pleasantly surprised. At the price of $11.99, do expect the menu to be small. No sashimi but salmon sushi is available. They have a list of very good rolls, our favourites being the spicy crunch sushi, spicy salmon sushi, and spicy crab sushi---see a pattern here? There's something in their spicy sauce that's quite addicting.

There is also a list of cooked foods, among which we only had the miso soup (really good) and soup udon (good). It was quite a satisfying meal that came quite quickly. For our second round, however, the service slowed down, and we eventually decided to cancel our order since our food set in."}
{"text":"I'm not a complainer. I'm easy-going. But this was the worst service I ever experienced in a Japanese sushi restaurant. 

I was taken to Kyoto House by my companion, because it was conveniently located near the bus station, where she needed to be immediately after our dinner. 

We ordered a la carte, NOT the all-you-can-eat option. My companion's order arrived about 15 minutes later. Then, 5 minutes later, our shared appetizer dish arrived. Another 20 minutes went by and I didn't receive my own order. 

I inquired with the server, and he went to the bar and started arguing -- and then laughing -- with the sushi chefs behind the bar. The server told me, \"the sushi chef is crazy and didn't get the order right\". Server then returned a few minutes later with a dish that didn't even resemble what I'd ordered (it was half the amount of items of what it should have been) and then he quickly disappeared. When I summoned him and showed him that I was given the wrong dish he apologized and returned the dish to the sushi bar. Finally he brought a free dish (which was half the items removed from the first incorrect dish, re-plated) and then the dish I ordered. Except that, too was also not exactly matching the menu description of what I ordered. But by that point I thought, \"screw it, there's no hope here and I'm never returning after this horrible experience.\"

Oh ya, just as another reviewer pointed out, they DILUTE their SOY SAUCE with WATER!! WTF!?!

I will not give this terrible excuse for a sushi restaurant another chance, it's just not worth it after reading all the other bad reviews... I think it's obvious this place doesn't care."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue but this location is a downtown staple! Just like what other reviewers say, it is a hit or miss. You can tell that they tried their best to fit as many tables as they could. I have been coming here years and nothing has changed. Order by paper and pencil and get your order in no time. Service is really quick, so that means that they are more prone to giving you the wrong items, which I do not complain about. Almost every time I come here, there is always a mistake (eg. wrong number of pieces or getting something I did not order). For the price, I say it is worth it for the lunch menu. This place does get busy as there are a lot of people shopping, on break at work or near school."}
{"text":"Service is really awful and slow! No point making a reservation as they will give it away to other customers who walk in before you arrive. Terrible customer service and ethics. Also, what is with the crazy pricing? Why charge a 3 year old the same price as a 10 year old child? There's no way a 3 year old will eat anywhere near the same amount as a 10 year old! Totally inappropriate pricing. Will never return here. Horrible experience and service."}
{"text":"You pay for what you get. That quote truly symbolizes Kyoto House. It's cheap but it doesn't have a lot of selection. The quality isn't that great either. Sometimes you'll get icy fish, sometimes you'll get warm to hot rice for your nigiri and rolls (gross) with warm fish on top (double gross). Most times, however, you'll just get below average sushi. The soy sauce and kitchen food is good though, but I'm here to eat sushi, not tempura or katsu. They do forget your orders sometimes or they give you the wrong amount of dinky pieces of sashimi when you're in a group of 6 and you ask for 50 pieces."}
{"text":"Every time we passed by, I noticed that it was always packed. Now I know why. Everything we ordered was super fresh and delicious.  They had a huge selection for their all you can eat dinner. The workers were very friendly and helpful although I was expecting Japanese workers. I would definitely return when if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Money hungry. I left 2-3 little rice balls that game with the sushi and they were threatening to overcharge. BS"}
{"text":"For being in a convenient location, this sushi joint is priced pretty cheap. We came on a busy Friday night and the place was absolutely packed; however, they allowed us to figure out our order before we got seated and we got seated quite promptly after about a 10 minute wait. 

The fish were not quite to my standards. You could clearly see the salmon was very pale in colour. Generally, bright orange colour tastes much fresher than their counterparts. The surf clam sashimi also had a very gritty texture to it, you could tell you were eating sand that they did not clean off. Also their white tuna sashimi was cut into blocks instead of long rectangular shapes, this isn't a texture or cut I am a fan of at all, and I've never experienced sashimi being cut like this before.

However, despite all this chaos, it wasn't the absolute worst sushi I've ever eaten. It was pretty decent especially for how cheap it was. My number one vice for sushi places though is whether or not they pack on rice during busy hours. Fortunately, the chefs have dignity and do not do this here.

Overall, it was okay. I probably wouldn't spend my money here again though for such a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Good price, okay sushi quality, semi-decent service. The staff could be a little nicer. Near the end of the lunch rush, they get a little lazy in how they roll their rolls, it can fall apart. Despite this, I keep coming back because it's a efficient place to get cheap AYCE sushi downtown, and their timings for lunch vs dinner are really convenient. Where most places end their lunch at 4pm, Kyoto keeps going til 5:45pm."}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars.

A no-frills AYCE experience.

Kyoto House is a place that I frequent because it serves sushi that is completely average, yet the prices aren't bad for AYCE!  The restaurant is run by Chinese people, not Japanese. 

The location is set up to fit as many tables as possible because they do get quite busy during peak hours.  Most of their rolls/sashimi meet expectations - but I feel like their hot foods are lacking. The selection is definitely on the shorter side for most AYCE restaurants (e.g. dessert is only the choice of 2 ice creams).  The service is average - fast but not particularly attentive.  However, when choosing AYCE, I do not expect high calibre of service. 

One of my favourite things about the restaurant is that on weekends, they do not raise their prices (19.99 for dinner).  Overall, It's really a convenient place to eat AYCE sushi at a decent price more than anything.  It's located at Dundas and Bay, right across from the Greyhound station."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends came here because we simply looked around and pointed at a restaurant. We were hungry and all you can eat seemed like the good option at the time. Regrettable decision. As soon as I put the first bite of Teriyaki salmon to my mouth I instinctively blurted with dismay \"my mouth is so sad right now\". I must have looked pretty serious and disappointed because it garnered a good laugh from my friends. However the joke didn't last long as each dish that came out was disappointing. Everything looked slapped together hap haphazardly (even more so than your average AYCE restaurant). Things were either over cooked or under cooked and the sashimi tasted a far cry from fresh. And to top off less than mediocre food, service was awful. Service was standoffish and brisk to a point of being semi-rude and I watched a server roll her eyes at another customer. To be completely frank, I'm surprised this place is still in business."}
{"text":"My worst experience with all you can eat sushi. The fish tasted stale and was really disgusting. I would not recommend this place to anyone. 
The service is not the best either. But it call comes down to the food which was not fresh or nom nom at all. So this place is a never go for me."}
{"text":"it's not bad but you could probably find a better AYCE in toronto.
the service is alright... we had to wait for a good15 to 20 usually for our second orders... it kinda sucks when i left my earphones there.. i called them and they said they have it.. when i got there they said that they dont have it anymore.. Boooo!!!! they're sushi is average nothing really special...."}
{"text":"Came by here randomly cause my friends wanted to get dinner. I've never been here before but I've seen it as I'm walking the streets of Toronto. Didn't know it was AYCE but it was surprisingly pretty cheap for a Sat night ayce dinner. I wasn't even hungry so I was like damn, overpaying for food but whatever my friends were all here.

The food was.. like meh. But reflects the price. We arrived around 630pm sat night and it was super busy. We got a booth at the back that can seat probably up to 10 people. Service was good - fast paced and all but they were very strict to a time limit. 630-730 was all we got. You can hear the employees speaking in Mando saying that we finally left and stuff lol.

Didn't felt like taking pictures, non was worth taking.

FYI the \"karaga\" aka supposed to be karaage.. was a huge turn off."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. The quality of their sashimi is decent enough for the dinner price you're paying. It is a great option if you're looking to chow down on salmon and white tuna (butterfish) sashimi. Their rolls are average and poorly assembled.

Sadly, everything else on the menu is below par for me. I would suggest you not order the chicken karaage, it's the most disappointing option they have. The standards of AYCE sushi are raising in Toronto, so I rather pay a bit more for better quality of food. I'm not a huge eater so this definitely won't be my first choice again for sushi or AYCE."}
{"text":"Today the restaurant was packed with people waiting outside. Sadly, it does not speak for the quality. Ordered the assorted tempura box. Definitely below average.

I noted that it came with rice, but nothing I could really eat the rice with. It is Japanese rice so, still good rice."}
{"text":"Honestly, worst sushi place I have tried. But well, you can't expect much with this price, all you can eat $21.95 each for dinner. I'm here only because everywhere else is closed... and I was extremely hungry. Wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"$7 lunch special for 2 rolls and a pop is pretty dang good considering how filling you'll get with the portions. I wouldn't say it's quality sushi, but they do put in lots of toppings and fish inside their maki rolls!

My personal favourite is the dragon roll and spicy salmon ! :)"}
{"text":"It is in a convenient location and is reasonably priced.  The quality is average... not particularly good or bad.  The location itself is busy but seems a little dated and dingy.    A decent experience but not one I would seek out to have again."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick lunch with friends on a Saturday longweekend. Being from Ottawa I was excited to try Toronto Ayce sushi -  price, taste and variety I've heard were all better than back home. Lunch only came to 13$after tax. Sushi tasted decent, the rice tasted really fresh and in my opinion can make or break a sushi roll. The only downside was the limited selection of sushi choices. I love dragon, spider rolls and sashimi and none were available for lunch! Highlights from the lunch menu were the spicy salmon rolls, tempura, gyoza and ice cream! We had quite a few leftover rolls but they didn't overcharge us, which is a huge plus - worthy of another star :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered this AYCE sushi restaurant by mistake today and was gladly surprised. We had their $13.99 AYCE lunch which is very reasonable for sushi lunch.

We arrived just before the lunch rush so we were able to get a table right away. Our orders came out really quick. The servers were nice and friendly. We enjoyed the salmon sushi and various maki rolls. We were able to finish lunch in less than an hour which is great when you have work. By the time we left there was a wait by the door.

We would definitely return when we are craving some affordable sushi downtown.

PS: They do not accept visa. Only debit and mastercard."}
{"text":"We had dinner here while we were waiting for a movie. It is closed to Dundas cinemaplex and God for having a meal before movie. The food is tasty considering that being AYCE. 
But servers need to be more friendly. However the service is very efficient."}
{"text":"Since I live quite north, every time I visit downtown -- i make sure to come here for lunch! I love the food here, there's good selection, very tentative waitresses, its absolutely delicious and at a very fair price for AYCE. 

What I enjoy most is probably the thick slabs of fish that they use for the individual sushi pieces. An absolute must try is their crunch roll and their spicy white tuna hand roll! 

The restaurant can improve on its cleanliness though... the bathrooms are pretty nasty and the table tops can be kinda grimy at times... Also, when it gets hectic during lunch or dinner times over the weekend, the quality of food can go down the drain. The rushed work from the sushi chefs lead to crumbly rolls that fall apart easily. Also, I've noticed that when you order sashimi in small quantities you get larger slabs. If you order a large quantity of sashimi, they just give you thinner slices. 

All in all, I really do enjoy the food and prices here!"}
{"text":"What will happen if you dilute the soy sauce with water? Add to that uninterested server and sticky table?

Kyoto House.

Overall food quality is just below average. You know, those rolls that tend to unroll, a vintage-looking salad with kraft-crafted dressing, etc... Nothing to dream about, rather something to forget quickly and without appreciation.

But diluted soy sauce??? Oh man...

Don't go there."}
