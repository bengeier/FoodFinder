{"text":"I would not recommend this place. Take everyone's word for it.  I went here on a date because the Italian place that used to be at this location must have closed down, so we said what the hell and gave it a try. Big mistake.  The only good thing about the experience is the story that I get to tell for the rest of my life about this place and the service.  1) The place is poorly decorated and just looks dirty. This should have been our first sign, but we didn't listen to our gut.  2) We asked for wine and the server said that she didn't think they had any. She came back and then said that she has a little red wine, but it looked like that pink boxed wine. Later, another table asked for wine and she said, \"No, we don't have any good wine, all of it is bad.\" Yeah, we could tell after the first sip.  3) The food tasted like a TV dinner with even more salt. We both couldn't finish ours.  4) Service wasn't existent. Seriously, we had to flag her down to get anything and we were one of three groups in the place. It was comical.  5) The prices were ridiculousness for what you got in terms of service and food.   Bottom line: I over payed for bad wine, crappy food, and non-existent service.   I have no idea how this place is still open. :-\ Maybe they have made improvements. Your guess is as good as mine."}
{"text":"Have you ever wished there was a restuarant that served food that tasted just like the food you bought from your grocer's freezer?  Well, then Bistro Daniel is for you.  You get all that frozen mass produced taste without the hassle of reading the microwave directions or having to throw the carton away.  They even go the extra mile of serving fresh sliced white bread (yum!)."}
