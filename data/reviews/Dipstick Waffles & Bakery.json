{"text":"The BEST waffles ever!! We got strawberry and nutella, smores, caramel pecan, and nutella Oreo.  They were each so different and SO delicious.  The best customer service ever.  The owner was there making waffles and he was so clean, fast and nice.  We will definitely be following and buying again.  Thanx guys!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan - I've been spoiled by another truck! Over cooked as it was a little too dark/well done!"}
{"text":"Delicious waffles conveniently on a stick! Smores is my personal favorite, but I heard lots of good things about strawberry Nutella. Guy who owns it is super friendly! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm at the food truck Friday in Peoria, AZ and while I'm waiting for my waffle I witnessed the female inside the truck add vegetable oil to the Nutella! Yuck! Who does that! I'm assuming to make it go further?? Also I've been waiting 10 mins and it looks as if they have one waffle iron . Not impressed at all. Also has little children running the cash register and the man is not using gloves Inside while preparing the waffles. Sprinkled nuts and apples w his bare hands!!!"}
{"text":"They came our to my elementary school's fundraiser night. Friendly staff and great creations!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I checked out a bunch of food trucks that were clustered together over on cave creek & Peoria in Phoenix. We tried three different trucks; dipstick easily being the best one in the bunch. Get the s'mores waffle on a stick; it's stuffed with Nutella, graham cracker & marshmallows. To the dipstick crew: get a peanut butter and jelly option! Then you would have my life long loyalty... Anyway.... I'll be back!"}
