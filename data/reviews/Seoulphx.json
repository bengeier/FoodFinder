{"text":"been there twice first time was served spoiled meat and then next time was served spoiled side dish a person came over and tried explain why she thinks it was spoiled but never replaced. service was terrible and menu is way over-priced deserve 0 star!!!!"}
{"text":"Its mediocre at best. Perhaps it was what I got. All the sushi was pretty basic and tasteless. Very empty on a Saturday afternoon /evening. Expensive and lack luster. PS. I like to drink water, but not from here. A very weird taste."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, best Korean BBQ I've ever had! The panchan, kalbi, and janpong are delcious. The sushi is fresh and artfully cut. The service was excellent & the restaurant had a great atmosphere. 11/10 recommend!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place and it was all that and then some. Great ambience and every server was really pleasant and knowledgeable. There was so much food and all of it was great. Not the cheapest Korean BBQ but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch and it was simply excellent. I've been to many Korean BBQ places and like others mention this is a little more upscale than most, excellent service, it's new and clean. Food was great. I had salted makeral which is a rare delight, perfectly cooked bulgogi style short ribs, and of course their assortment of small dishes that come with the meal. Those were a real treat - anyone who likes \"tapas\" would definitely like this place. My companion is a chinese gentleman had seafood soup that was served hot, steaming, and he took one spoonful then started nodding his head in instant approval. I will return with the family for a special night out."}
{"text":"We made a reservation. Got right in at the time of it, and got drinks right away. The service was excellent and the food was even better. Nick was our server. Very polite and knowledgeable about any questions we had. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My wife and I loved the food and service. The place is very well decorated too. Come eat here."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend during a trip and it was outstanding. I love Korean food, and this is some of the best I've ever had. The food was delicious and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the chicken wings, jam bong and the kalbi jim. I also tried this drink with soju and a melon bar in it. I can't remember what it's called, but it was so good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here two nights ago. The service was great, the server tried to be as accommodating but there's no food available for kids. It's pricey and we didn't even get the Korean BBQ. It was worth trying, though. A lot of different options came out but we were so stuffed by the time our meals came out. Food tastes decent. We got the fried rice and the beef and pork dumpling soup."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the kimchi stew!  Seriously the best I've had in the valley.  The service was really good and loved the atmosphere.  Like the sides they had with the BBQ!  Just a little too expensive for me."}
{"text":"I'm an international student who came from south Korea. And i always had a craving for real Korean food here until i found this restaurant last week!! My first visit was about a week ago and I visited this same restaurant 3 times already!! I tried different menus every time and was so surprised by the fact that everything i tried was soooo good!! If you want to try a real authentic Korean food, this place should be the first place to visit for sure!! I'm so excited that we have this restaurant in our area. This is something that you won't normally get even in Korea. And it reminds me of my childhood memory with my grandma who always made a great food. Also, the servers were amazing too. They have a bell system and you can push the button whenever you need anything but i barely used them since the servers always knew the need in advance and came to us. All of them were nice and kind, and best of all, they got customer's need right away that i didn't really have to explain much about what i want. Overall, i think even 5 stars are not enough for this restaurant and highly recommend this place for both Koreans(Try it and feel how authentic it is. You can't compare any others in U.S.) and people from other cultures.(Servers are real nice people and they are always willing to explain what the food is and how to eat. If you're interested in Korean food, this would be the perfect place to start) Oh and i usually visit as a small group with my friends but i saw they also have several, pretty big private rooms maybe for meetings or birthday parties i guess? So if you're looking for a place for a big party, this should be one of your considerations."}
{"text":"We went here as a family with all the grandchildren! What a fun place. The decor was great and the food was excellent. The service was exceptional too!! I had a sashimi salad.. Which was excellent!!! Also sweet and sour pork belly. Very yummy too!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Surprised to find some of the best Korean food I have ever eaten in Phoenix of all places.  Traveling from Chicago on golf trip and managed to find this gem.  Will definitely be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for us the food was tasteless.  The server repeatedly said the meats are marinated for 10 days.  I was tempted to ask if It was marinated in water  It was pretty empty but they still got our order wrong.  I was excited to try this place because of the reviews.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was phenomenal! Highly recommend anyone that wants very good Korean BBQ to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.    We ordered the #38 chapchae, #47 beef bulgogi dukbaegi (my personal favorite), #68 soon-tofu and #70 galbi-tang.   The servers were all very attentive and checked in on us often to see if we needed anything.  At the end of the meal we were served a sweet cold drink which was just the perfect way to cap off a wonderful meal.  Will definitely come back and often."}
{"text":"Yelped korean food and found this place and it got good reviews so had to try out!   A great variety of panchan! And their service was spot on. We were immediately asked if we needed to order drinks first and we were so dang thirsty from our airplane ride!   Homemade friend dumplings- super! Plumped filled and cooked to perfection. I had to add a little soy sauce to the dipping sauce because it was a little sweet for my taste.  Spicy fried chicken wings- my hubbies favorite to eat anywhere! Thumbs up !  Kalbi tang- great broth! And our waitress even brought us some ponzu dipping sauce when asked because that's what we're used to back in la/Orange County.  Menow meyun  tang (spelling in English is pretty bad so spicy fish soup) - loads of seafood and fish. Very full and flavorful!   Bathroom squeaky clean and the inside is very large and modern interior.  So glad we went! Took a hour because of traffic but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've just had one of the best meals of my life.  The Kalbi short rib soup had a rich, slightly sweet broth filled with chunks of hearty meat that melted in my mouth.   The soup also had these wonderful dumplings, mushrooms, Vegetables and even a little Chestnut. Served with 14 side dishes and rice, there was plenty for a second meal to take home.   Every server in the place stopped by multiple times to see how I was. It was like they were celebrating with me."}
{"text":"Omg!! I was in Phoenix on Vacation with my family, decided to try this restaurant because we love Korean food/BBQ! I wish I could give them more stars!! I will come back when in Phoenix!!! The waitress was very hospitable! And the meat was the best cut! It was my sons birthday and he was not disappointed! We all were very satisfied by our meals! If you're reading this and love Korean BBQ do yourself a favor and just go!!! You too will love this! It's by far my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant!"}
{"text":"Took the wife and kid to try out the new Korean BBQ in town. The atmosphere was very nice, services was really quick, and they have a pretty big menu. The wait staff was really attentive and answer all of our questions. The food was really good,  it I think they are slightly over price. The wife and I both agree, the food was amazing. The best we've tasted around. They have some really unique dishes, that i haven't seen around the Phoenix area. This place would have gotten a five star, if they would have boxed out meal for us. It was kind of difficult for us to box soup and ensure our son was turning in the gas grill at the table.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was great, however very expensive! Beautiful modern setting. Bill was not given us however just recited to us, so we wee in able to see final charges.   No lunch menu or specials offered on the weekend, only Monday - Friday."}
{"text":"Okay this had to be the best korean food I've ever had. And that is saying something as a half korean who grew up in california and has even been to Korea. We ordered the gamjatang which came in this huge, impressive portion to split between four people. That was amazing. The fried squid and kalbitang were amazing too. Not to mention that they really load you up on banchans!! Oh my lord!! And to top it all off, the service was absolutely excellent. I was blown away; my three month old daughter was extremely fussy and screaming bloody murder while we were eating... when all of a sudden one of the workers just came and wanted to hold my screaming daughter for me so I could eat!! Talk about wonderful people!!  I don't come to Arizona often but when I do, I will definitely be coming back here at least once a trip. Thank you for an amazing korean food experience"}
{"text":"Really really great service. We walked in 30 minutes before closing, and all but a few of the menu items were available to us due to them shutting down certain machines needed for some dishes. We drove a long way into town and really wanted some comfort food, which is exactly what we found here with the tofu stews and bibimbap. Our food came with an overwhelming number of sides, all of which were delicious (they may take some getting used to if you're not familiar with Asian/Korean food).   We were greeted and checked on upon by an older man and woman, who I assumed to be the family that owned the place. They were extremely friendly and welcoming and really enhanced our experience here!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The traditional Korean dishes are very flavorful. Many dishes come with a small dish appetizer assortment, that any foodie is sure to appreciate. Give it a try and I'm sure you'd want to come back by like we do. We had a few extra apps., niguri, and some Korean beef dishes. Everything was prepared very well."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  Service a little slow but they were jammed.  Best Korean food!!!!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent.   Private dining rooms.   Perfect for a party or celebration!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great,  I got my food quickly and the waitress was friendly. They have a button on the table to get the attention of the waitress but it's a weird gimmick that loses the authenticity of going to nice restaurant, otherwise the place look amazing.  The food is 3 1/2 stars and a bit over priced. Overall the service is where they excel above my expectations."}
{"text":"An adventure in eating with great food and servers who help you know what you want. We got the meats and sides for a crowd love the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"So gross. Super long wait time just to get your food. No way to eat there on your lunch break and even if you get take out it takes more then 30 min to get. Was excited to try and wish I didn't."}
{"text":"The service was great! You push the call button and one of the wait staff will be at your table very quickly. The restaurant and restrooms are very nice and well maintained. As far as the food goes, nothing was amazing, but nothing was horrible either. We did not try the BBQ, and might consider going back to try that sometime. We did try the Yuk-Gae-Jang and the Dragon Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Wildfire Roll, and California Tempura. We felt that everything was a little overpriced and we know better sushi spots with cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Good Korean bbq and the sushi I good too , great atmosphere ,table button service , fast , efficient, correct orders .  When I feel the need for Korean food , this is where I go , happy hour and drink specials. Really close to my pad"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean Restaurant I've ever had.  The Kalbi Jim was unbelievable, and the chicken wings were amazing.  We ate outside in the Patio and the service was very good here."}
{"text":"First time there. Food was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Answered any questions you may have. Definitely will eat there again."}
{"text":"Very nice 14 free side dishes and delicious BBQ combo! It was a great amount of food as well. The service was good too as he grilled the meat in front of us and very patiently explaining the items. Very authentic Korean food operated by Korean people."}
{"text":"I think that this was a very good restaurant, and deserves 5 stars, because many, many times I go to Korean restaurants in L.A or San Jose, etc. I think this one served pretty good quality of Korean food hardly found in AZ, Lots of very friendly waiters and waitresses, many side dish choices, the restaurant is very big and cozy, and it is very clean. I enjoyed the fried dumplings, all the side dishes, kalbi tang, gom tang, yuk gae jang and tofu soup. Especially tofu was home made and my dad loved it. Everything was pretty quick and we got a table quickly. I enjoyed the whole meal! The restaurant was very spacey with a clean restroom, an interesting sushi bar and more things to lure my attention. Authentic Korean food and I enjoyed eating here!!! Thank you:)!"}
{"text":"Excellent Korean BBQ food! Great location, nice atmosphere inside, not crowded at all, and there's even a \"bell\" to ring for service at each table. All the people who work there were hustling and doing a great job at serving us and making sure we got everything we needed. Really really impressed and we've been coming back 6 times so far and you bet we will be back every time we want Korean BBQ! Thank you!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Searched this place in yelp , we wanted to try .Called last night at 9:00pm , a woman answer the phone! I asked her if we coming in 10min can we still dine in , she seems had some attitude asked me \"what do you want ? You know they kitchen close pretty soon \" I told her We are going to have BBQ, and she put me on hold , not sure if she hang up on me or the phone cut off .  I did not call back , we choose oh ya in Scottsdale . I just wanted to say , the hour they listed on yelp or google that they close at 10pm so it was just 9oclock and I told the women we can be there in 10min , why is such a problem that we can't dine in ?  It's ok though , I may still try this place next time !"}
{"text":"Good authentic traditional korean dishes with ample parking. We came for lunch and their portions were pretty small. Ordered bbq kalbi and for $13.99 for lunch we got four small pieces of meat.( not the whole strip of LA kalbi but four pieces) thats like dinner pricing and the portioning were way too small. Kimchi jjigae and soon tofu were tasty."}
{"text":"Great cuts of meat for the BBQ! Everything was tender! Can't go wrong with anything there! We were a party of 4 and chose the 5 meat combo! Such a great deal! Will be coming back soon and it's my new place to go!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Korean cuisine and have been craving an authentic restaurant that rivaled my favorite East Coast eateries for some time now. Well my prayers have been answered!! THANKS Seoul BBQ & Sushi (Seoulphx)!! The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, the service was wonderful, the portions were substantial and the signature drinks were delicious (the bartender even allowed one of my party to sample Saki for the their first time). I have definitely found a new Phoenix favorite."}
{"text":"SOLID!!!!   I cant wait to go back.  Super friendly staff and great food.  Great spot for a big group too!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place. The owners are wonderful! The food was delicious. Every staff member is so attentive. This is by far the best Korean BBQ we've found in PHX."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place while on a double date. I'm happy that it's so much closer to home and I can get my kbbq fix more often. The restaurant is clean, updated, and a lot bigger than I thought it would be (insert a Dr Who 'it's bigger on the inside clip'). However, like all kbbq places, it is pricey. We ordered the combination D which is $139.99 before tax and tip. However, the amount of food and the quality of meat are worth it. Every meat we ordered was amazing quality- very tender and flavorful. The marinades didn't overpower the taste of the meat like at some places. They'll even cook the meat for you or help you if you ask. The portions were decent too. The meal doesn't stop there though! We also had a crazy amount of banchan, soup (2 options), rice, scallion pancake, shumai, and lettuce to make wraps. They also gave us sesame oil and an amazing ginger dressing to dip meat in. I was very fat and happy by the time we finished dinner. However, there were a couple of hiccups during our meal. I chalk it up to an inexperienced waiter or maybe too many things to remember to bring to the table? Whatever the reason, our meat was brought out but the sides had been forgotten. We were quickly brought the banchan- my favorites were the potato salad and the pickled veggies. However, we had to ask again for rice, another time for our soup, and different time for any sauces (we originally asked for a dressing for the salad since it was just plain shredded lettuce and carrots in a bowl). Even though service wasn't smooth, it was quickly fixed by either our waiter or the owner. Both were incredibly quick to bring us any refills we asked for or anything we were missing. The owner was amazingly nice and respectful and that by itself earned a star from me."}
{"text":"Great food!! We always have the combo BBQ and I leave stuffed. If you've never have Korean food go with someone that has had this type of food. Oh and don't be intimidated by the menu their very nice and willing to explain if you ask."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean Food!  I often drive North on I-17 and see their sign \"coming soon\". Finally after a couple of months they have opened. My wife and I tried this place for the first time yesterday. Although we are a takeout kind of couple I was impressed when we walked into the restaurant. Very clean. The decor provides an appealing display of their Korean heritage. Conservative, but beautiful. I was greeted promptly and (I should have got her name. but I think she is part-owner) an eagerness to answer any questions. My wife and I are Korean food veterans.  There are few Korean restaurants in Phoenix. We have tried most of them. This is by far the best. What we ordered: Lunch portions Mandu - Excellent. Not from a freezer. LARGE. One order would be enough for a good meal.  Shumai - Also made from scratch. Very tasty.  Beef bulgogi - haven't had this combination of flavors for so long. Wonderful marinade to go along with a nice char taste. The beef is lean and the serving is generous.  Spicy chicken - Oh my (). You better like heat and have rice nearby to take away the initial sting. I didn't expect it would be that hot. Although I really enjoyed this dish. Again, very nice portion.  Dinner portions  Kimchi-jiige - Very spicy. Excellent flavored soup. Lots of vegetables.  Chapchae - Over-the-top! Very authentic. If my wife says it's good food. It's good.  The different side dishes provided were kimchee and various pickled or preserved vegetables. Not frozen. Not prepacked. Presented beautifully.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm from California where there is definitely not a shortage of Korean bbq/restaurants. Verdict? I'd probably rate it  2.5 stars if it were possible and most likely won't return.  Food: Pretty pricey. My fiancé's grandpa got the beef bibimbap and my fiancé and I shared the beef bulgogi--good portion and the right amount of tender, but for the price, other places are comparable in taste for cheaper.  Atmosphere: tons of seating and looked like there was even a private room you can rent out. Clean/spacious overall.  Service: this was the downfall for me. While the servers were very friendly, I went here with my fiancé's grandpa and uncle who have never had Korean bbq and inevitably had questions. The servers unfortunately couldn't answer any of the questions we had about the menu.   Between the price and the service, in the future I'd go elsewhere to get my Korean bbq fix."}
{"text":"We found this place on a whim, and it was probably the best whim decision restaurant we've ever been to! First of all the place is lovely inside. Very nice space with private rooms for larger parties. The service was fast & very friendly. The food, drinks, & dessert were all delicious. We will definitely be coming back & spreading the word about this much needed restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I have ever had. Sushi was unexceptional. Food was small portions and unsatisfying. Way overpriced! I can't believe I gave them money for their crap food and crap service. I will never be back. DON'T GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"}
{"text":"The family took me here for my birthday. We won't be back. Easily the worst service I think I've ever had out dining. Food was mediocre at best. Really skimpy portions for the BBQ. The side dishes were all of poor quality. Food was better when it was a Friday's.... The atmosphere and the hovering owner and manager was just off. I felt bad because I think they know it's a rip off yet perhaps they aren't setting the prices..... also to our undertrained and horrible waitress, never ever ask if you need change."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service and food! Great clean and modern space with very friendly staff. You get so much food here. Very high quality as well."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ! This is absolutely one of the best places I've been to. The private rooms are a huge plus for both business and family. I'm an Asian and can testify it's a great place to go!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to Sedona and passed this on the highway and I knew it was exactly where I was stopping on my way back to the airport and so I did.  I'm Korean and I have Korean food everyday.  That being said, the food and banchan were superb.  I ordered the yook-gae-jang and my dinner date had the seafood soon-doo-boo.  Both were larger portions than most restaurants and so I was OK with the higher prices.  Service, location, parking, food, and décor were all superb!  I, hopefully, will be back on my next trip there."}
{"text":"Food runner served my soup to someone else then served it to me thinking I wouldn't notice. I had a seaweed salad with sashimi. Sashimi wasn't fresh with the exception of the salmon. Soup was bland even with the sides. The sides are basically just different types of pickled cabbage/kimchi. I wish I could've gotten some rice paper with it or at least large leafs of lettuce or cabbage to mix it with my rice to enjoy. I had to ask for extra rice because the one that goes with the meal is a quarter cup serving. I also noticed that the waiters have to cook the bbq for you on your table which defeats the purpose. I'm fairly disappointed. I'm new to Phoenix and I haven't found a reasonably priced Korean/Japanese/Thai/Chinese anything. Places out here think it's ok to overprice because they're the only option in the area. Honestly nothing compares to the places in LA. The hostess was really nice and they have metal chopsticks Which is the only reason why I'm giving ANY stars. I was thinking of not posting anything because I don't like giving bad yelp reviews, but I felt like it was a responsibility to post my experience."}
{"text":"I drove out here to enjoy some Korean food that I have been craving. I lived in South Korea for two years and grew to love the cuisine. For my first order, I got the kimchi jigae. It's a hotpot like stew and it had all the flavors that i remembered. I just wish it just came with more especially considering the price. The sides that came with the meal, were all pretty good. My favorite were the kimchi and the potatoes. Overall the food was great but the portions were small.  The staff was super polite. This place had a mixture of Korean old ladies and younger staff of different ethnicities. My water never went dry with how much they paid attention. The restaurant is very clean and modern. It's honestly really nice inside.   Me and my buddy weren't expecting a military discount but we came in uniform and got one without asking."}
{"text":"Lunch today w/ sister, love the place, clean, pleasent atmosphere, Waite staff knowledgeable. I've had Korean before, first time here, full luncheon crowd, business & locals; Joyce ordered spicy pork,w/8 sides, for me it was BBQ beef, & 8 sides. Sides are sm. Taster dishes and do order their bread & dipping sauces. We will go for dinner nxt. And it won't be too long, it might be the first time BUT not the last! Go on, give SEOUL a try, ypull be happy you did (:!!"}
{"text":"On a whim, my wife and I decided to go out to lunch. We were headed to Pappadeaux's when Seoul BBQ & Sushi caught our eye. We frequent Pappadeaux's often and this was the first time we noticed. There weren't many cars there, and we drove around looking to make sure it was even open. We decided to double back and give it a try. From the front door, the hostess was so incredibly nice and sincere with her welcome. As we were lead to our table, we noticed that it had a hot place in the middle. My wife got excited. We sat down and were handed two massive menus. There was many different choices. I love Korean BBQ, Japanese and Asian quinine alike, and my wife is also fan and loves her sushi. This place had it all. I ordered tempura shrimp, and the BBQ Beef lunch special. It came with soup, steamed rice and 8 (yeah, I thought it was a typo... It wasn't) side dishes. My wife opted for some sushi and the teriyaki chicken.   The service was impeccable. The wait staff was h very friendly, and helpful. Our food came out in a flash, you hear me. We blinked and they were bringing it out. It was piping hot, and sizzling as they sat it down. One bite of my BBQ Beef and I got teary eyed. It had the nerve to be everything I expected with a little smoked flavor as if it was grilled over wood. It was well seasoned and AMAZING. I reached across the table and snatch some chicken. Bam! Amazing as well. Out of the 8 sides we loved the radish and cabbage kimchi, the caramelized potato, the fish cake (and I don't eat fish, and had eaten it all before asking what it was and was surprised... It was delicious)... I took pictures of what was left of our food, and sent out texts to my friends. I ordered a second order of the teriyaki chicken for lunch tomorrow, and I'm posting a review here. This is a great place for a girl's night, a date night, or an affordable lunch. We loved it and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So much fun and SO much food. We had some sashimi and the crispy rice sushi to start.  Very good, very fresh and nice portions. My husband and son shared a BBQ combo of short ribs and bulgogi. They loved it! Came with all the little bowls of goodness, shumi, soup, rice, a veggie pancake and some veggies and salad. Literally too much food. I got a bibim bop, with a squeeze bottle of gochuchang on the side. So good! I haven't been this full since 2010! The service was exceptional. I tried a soju and it was pleasant but i don't have to have that again. They brought a little Korean dessert drink with the bill that tasted like iced apple pie. It was good but too full to enjoy. I can't wait to go back and pace myself a little better next time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and I love it. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. Our server was very kind and helpful. We ordered Korean BBQ combo B and it was fantastic. The meats have great flavor and seasoned well. The side dishes were so good. I would definitely come back again and recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The food is good, but nowhere near worth it when it comes to the price for the Korean BBQ. Sushi is good and worth the money, but the BBQ is extremely overpriced. $30 for $3 worth of frozen meat is ridiculous. With a party of 5, it took 20 minutes between the first entree and the last entree to hit the table, with the last entree being frozen beef that they call bulgogi. The short ribs cost  $35 where you would pay $15-20 for better quality and more meat at any of the other Korean BBQ joints in town. The service is also REALLY bad. The server was a nice guy, but he definitely needs more training. Also, random staff members would just walk up and start putting meat on out table grill. It was extremely rude and unprofessional. There needs to be a change in service very quickly or this place will not last. The best part of the meal was the mandu and that they have Hite. Other than that, only come here for sushi or the appetizers and the beer. DO NOT waste your money in the BBQ. If you want Korean BBQ of the same quality, go to Koryo at 43rd ave and Peoria and save 50%. We paid $80 for a $40 meal. More than likely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The place was amazing! One of the better choices for Korean BBQ in the valley! Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this place. The staff is great the food is the best Korean I have ever had( I have had a lot). The attention to detail to the decor to the dessert drink you get for free at the end make your visit a wonderful experience. Love the Kpop music! The drinks are some of the best I've had ( I love a good sweet drink). The 20 something side dishes are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place.  The 'unmissable' red signage is BIG & BOLD.  That is the only slight in this review, as it doesn't speak to the Korean elegance apparent as you walk up, and in!  The owners great you, and we waited just a few minutes.  The entire staff, the many servers and bussers have a very Korean like work ethic.  The food was spot on!  The tables, the bar, the rooms - Spot on!  Then there is the food. Having spent 10 days in Buson, S Korea, I can tell ya that there is nothing but perfection here!  Home made tofu in the soup, perfectly cut and marinated meats, 14 tiny bowls of tasty & authentic accompaniments circled the grill. Oh, JUST GO HERE!!!  You'll be thrilled you did.  Right next door to Pappadeauxs off I17 @ Peoria.  LOL, the big red sign..."}
{"text":"Terrible.  We sat down as soon as we got there which meant that it wasn't busy. We sat for 15 to 20 minutes. No one came to even offer us drinks in that time frame. You ring a bell for service and we did just that,  as well as another table across from us. They got help, we didn't.  Rang again and still nothing. We both were so excited to have a Korean BBQ near us, granted it's not AYCE like we are use to in socal. Never again.  We will drive to Tempe for our Korean BBQ. Teach your staff to acknowledge your customers,  even a \"we will be right with you\" is sufficient enough."}
{"text":"Found my favorite korean restaurant in Phoenix. Not only the food are delicious but the servers are extremely friendly. The lady that serve us found out that its my birthday today and she gave me icecream mochi for dessert. I already liked her from the beginning and I appreciate her even more. Also, unlike other restaurants, they serve so quick that i was surprised. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to experience some KBBQ without absolutely stuffing ourselves with AYCE. Seoulphx was a great way to satisfy that craving. Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable.   I know this has been beaten to death, but the banchan was both extensive and extremely edible, and refilled after any request. (I'm a sucker for fish cake).  The meat itself was also very succulent. The brisket was industry standard, it's not my favorite dish, but the bulgogi was loaded with flavor and not overloaded with fat."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ I've had in the valley by a mile. Amazing service and incredible food. The dumplings are homemade and taste it (plus are huge). There's tonssss of banchan so we didn't even need the appetizer. The Bibimbap is to die for. I am so excited we found this gem. The restaurant itself is also incredibly nice and perfect for a romantic date night. 10 stars. Pictured is the Dolsut Bibimbap."}
{"text":"Was in the area coincidentally around lunch, so perfect timing to try this place out. Seated and served promptly. Banchan selection was good and tasted delicious. Ordered Jalapeno Bombs, Jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and BBQ Chicken. Loved the jjamppong and jalapeno bombs, not spicy enough but they were delish. The chixken dish was a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, very good first experience, will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The best Korean food I've had in AZ! Friendly service, and they serve alot of the side dishes. Pot of barley tea and the sweet ginger drink at the end are nice, not many Korean restaurants in the area bring those things out anymore."}
{"text":"This use to be T.G.I.F's, a block away from my work. We were looking forward to a place other than Pappadeaux. This place was clean and  quite for a late lunch. Food was yummy, however out server was terrible. About a 20 year old girl with rings in herr face and bad makeup and attitude. If you wanna charge a premium price for food it should be served by at least a competent server. I spoke with some of my co-workers about our experience when we got back to the office and basically the same problem, mostly young inexperienced servers who do a poor job. Now some people did say they had more mature servers and the experience was awesome, unfortunately that was not ours."}
{"text":"ATTENTION PHOENIX NATIVES: If you've not been here you must try this place out. I enjoy eating Korean food so much, I decided to drive over to the other side of town just to have some jjigae.   Best decision EVER. My experience was amazing here! I felt welcome and at home Right away. From the hostess, to the servers, and the owner, service was excellent and the food was delicious! I ordered the sundubu jjigae, and it was absolutely phenomenal! It had the perfect level of spiciness to it with great flavor! High five to the cook(s) running the kitchen- My dish was brought out with a nice rumbling bubble to it :)  The owner, Albert, was very personable and I had a great time chatting with him about Korean cuisine amongst other things. Before I left, he had me try a few flavors of soju and I gotta say I can't believe I had never tried it sooner. ALL of the flavors I sampled were very smooth and refreshing. He was also so kind to offer me a nice refreshing rice drink that helps aid in digestion. I hope to come back here one day, and if I do ever end up in Phoenix again I will be sure to make a stop!   It's a shame I can't take this restaurant back to Austin, but thank you for the wonderful experience :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding!!!  My partner and I are visiting town and wanted Korean BBQ.  We tried this place and it was wonderful!!!!   The food was delicious and the staff and service was over the top friendly.  We also discovered a Korean drink called Soju.  It's a must try.   Ask them to sample a few flavors...wow!!!     We'd highly recommend coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Korean Bar B Q.  The food was wonderful.  The only reason I am giving them 4 and not 5 stars is it was quite pricey. However the staff was extremely friendly, the food was very fresh, and we had a very good time overall.  My family has had Korean Bar B Q many times over so it was great to experience it with people that knew what they were doing.  But the staff were also very good about explaining as well."}
{"text":"My wife and i visited this place for the first time on Jan 26th.  This place is awesome in a re-modeled TGIF building.  This is an upscale Korean BBQ restaurant so expect to pay a little more than the college town pricing.   There are quite a few BBQ tables with some large private rooms for large groups as well.  This place was pretty busy when we visited and quite a few people waiting to get seated.  We ordered the combo A which was a lot of food for 2 people.  The server did all the cooking and we just enjoyed the eating.  A lot of small dishes.  The waiters and servers were all nice and very professional.  We will definitely bring people back next time."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed in this place. We love our Korean BBQ and have been searching for a decent one near us since moving to the valley. Perhaps we were spoiled with all our options in Southern California or while living in South Korea, but this place was just bad, from service to pricing. We are highly unlikely to ever come to this location again. Hopefully they figure it out soon so that they don't lose more potential customers."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I have been eager to try it. The access is good from the freeway.  The restaurant is clean shinny and spacious with lots of tables. We went there for lunch. They have a lunch menu Monday through Friday.   We ordered Mandu and Haemul Pageon for appetizers.  There were 5 large pieces of fried Mandu well cooked well stuffed with delicious goodness. The pieces came out hot and not oily.  The Pageon covered the entire plate and was full of seafood. The edges were crusty and flavorful with wonderful texture. The insides were steaming and cooked just right, not doughy.    Yukyejjang came out in a nice thick bowel. The broth was hot with a delicious blend of spices and saltiness.  The meat and vegetables provided great texture and complement of flavors.   The Naengmyeon on the other hand is a cold dish.  The color was clear with hint of amber but to taste it was icy cold, refreshing and just a little bite from the mustard I added. The fresh made noodles were thin and had the appropriate wonderfully firm texture.  I drank in the broth then went to town on the noodles with the accompanying seasoned radish and cucumbers.   The Jjamppong came out with that steaming rich dark pepper red broth.  On the tongue it had a rich complement to heat, sweetness and smoke with flavors of the ocean.  The dish was filled with crabs, muscles, clams and shrimps in the shell. Delicious.   The Soon-tofu seafood style was also quite pleasing.   Just writing this is making me hungry for more.   So far this is the best Korean restaurant I have encountered in Arizona.   The service was excellent and the bathroom was very clean and modern."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise.  My guy has been talking about Korean food for years.  He lived there for a year while in the Air Force years ago.  I ran across this place in yelp.  We had two of our friends and had a great Sunday afternoon.  He said this brought back so many memories of his time there.   I loved all the little bowl of different side dishes.  Grab a few friends and come check out the experience with some amazing food."}
{"text":"New Korean BBQ spot in North Phoenix. Great service and food! Protons are just right. Go check it out if you are into Korean BBq, and if you are not you always have the option of fresh sushi."}
{"text":"I have been to many Korean BBQ in Arizona and in California. So far, this location is one of the few that has high quality meats. With that being said, it is by far the most expensive BBQ. I went to this location only once so I do not have anything to say about the services other than that they were OK. They ran out of side dishes and I was really disappointed, since we paid 39.99$ for each plate of meat. The portion is small too. However, do give it a try but you have been warned about the price for its portion and quality!  If you are going with a big party of 6+, I recommend to call in and make a reservation. They do have private rooms for such party."}
{"text":"-First if all this place looks amazing inside, one if the nicest looking Korean restaurants I've ever been to.  -Prices are very high in comparison to other Korean restaurants. -Best home made dumplings, highly recommended. -Sushi was ok, a little fishy. -They do not skimp on side dishes and bring out a lot. -Management is friendly and come check on you -Staff is not trained too well as both times I've been here they couldn't answer questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Great fresh and quality food. Friendly staff. Will definitely come again. Loved the amount and variety of sides"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant with upscale interior. Plenty of seats inside. I ordered about 6 different dishes to try out (and free side dishes). They are sweeter side and dishes come quickly. One thing that I noticed is their service and price.  Again this is a new restaurant where their service staffs still need to get trained (some of them are new). They are friendly though.  Price of dishes that I ordered (BBQ for 5 to 6 people, seafood pancake and more) are pricier and small quantity (particularly BBQ).   There are other Korean restaurants who provide similar or better taste of authentic Korean dishes with a reasonable price in Phoenix and Mesa area. It happened to my friend who took her friends to this restaurant and got surprised by the price.   Parking: Free and plenty of spaces Service: Friendly but need to improve Price: High for what they provide compare other Korean restaurants in this area Recommendation: Try Jjangbong (Spicy seafood noodle soup)"}
{"text":"Went in for Father's Day with 6 adults and 4 kids ranging from 1-4 years old. We had a private room, which was perfect. All the food was amazing and the service was on point. The owner was very accommodating and really friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The food is scrumptious and the owner and staff are extremely attentive and friendly. This is one of the best Korean BBQs I have ever had. If you are in Phoenix and want a delicious dinner with a wonderful ambiance, this is the place for you. The next time I'm in the Phoenix area, I plan on eating here."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for my dad's birthday, and I am very happy that we had his birthday lunch here!   My parents really only eat Asian food, and finding legitimate asian food that isn't in a hole-in-the-wall looking place is rare. I came across this on Yelp and decided to give it a try.   They have Korean and Japanese food. We ordered the home-made dumplings, seafood pancake, Samgyetang (chicken ginseng soup), and galbi.  Everything we tried was honestly very good. Everything was presented very nicely and picture worthy, and it tasted great! The side dishes are some of the best side dishes I've had. They are presented so well, and unlimited refills on those as well. Radish soup was great!   I also like the authenticity of this place. My parents wanted hot water, and they got barley tea, which is just made from roasted barley, to help aid digestion. Apparently it's a staple to Korean meals, and I love that they gave us that instead of just plain hot water.  A lady came over as we were eating the samgyetang, and she was telling us how to eat it. It's a ginseng soup with a whole stuffed chicken in it, ain't that easy to eat that thing, so thanks for helping us out.  Our server Ed was very attentive as well, and never forgot a thing that we asked.   All in all, It is much more expensive than other Korean bbq places. But, I can also see where the extra cost is coming from, and to me it was definitely worth that something extra! It was a great dining experience from beginning to end, and I will definitely come back for a nice dinner out or another celebration!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Korean food. Been here 3 times already with the family and we all love the food. Datson Bibimbap, Bulgogi and the rest are delicious! Try the Macha binsu dessert as well if you still have room after all the great food. Staff is friendly although there's probably some room for improvement on efficiency at times.  Overall, happy with the food and price is decent as well."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place as soon as I saw the restaurant from the I17 freeway. Finally got to try it today, on a Friday.  The restaurant was clean, service was prompt, the place nicely decorated. However, the very reason we came here was to try the barbecue on the table. I don't recall anything on the menu that mentioned anything about barbecue being available only if you order from the dinner menu. I was very disappointed that the server never bothered to ask if we wanted to do table barbecue. Maybe we were judged? Not sure. The food was ok but nothing to write home about. I could have gotten it from a to-go place just as good. We spent 35 dollars including tip for 2 lunch entrees and 1 appetizer.  No return trip to this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Portions are  small. Very stingy when it comes down to it. Food quality not the greatest. Service at first was great. When needed no one came around."}
{"text":"Foodie checking in .. all the way from NorCal. Had to stop in and visit one of the few Korean restaurants in Phoenix Arizona. Restaurant is roomy and clean and the waiters/waitresses very nice. Now to the food.. ordered three dishes .. Kalbi, soon-tofu and the grilled mackerel .. we opted to grill our own meat at the table. As the other Yelpers have noted a good variety of bonchan (side dishes). The Kalbi comes out boneless (wish they left the bone on) and the cut is quite thick. I would have preferred the more traditional thinner cut with rib on. The marinade was tasty-more on the sweeter side. The soon tofu soup was quite good. We asked for medium spicy but I would say it was on the milder side. If you like medium spicy ask for spicy.. the bonchan although a good selection was noticeably sweet. Overall, the experience was good. There's a bell for each table that is used to call your server. Foodie checking out..."}
{"text":"Even the coke tastes better here! My friend and I have found our newest obsession. I'm not Korean but I've spent a significant amount of time in Korea, and this place is legit. SIXTEEN banchan (side dishes), a giant serving of delicious bulgogi, and a steaming plate of mandu and I'm so full I can't imagine ever eating again. The super friendly owner, Albert, stopped by our table to chat with us and make sure everything was good but it wasn't--it was GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Handmade neng myun noodles for the win!  The side dishes are plentiful and really good here - even by LA standards.  Service is pretty good for a newer place and the interior is really nice.  I feel like I'm in CA instead of AZ!  The sashimi is fresh here.   Presentation and portions are good.     This is probably the best Korean place I've been to in Arizona.  Highly recommended!  The other yelp reviews don't reflect the yummy food and service here.  Glad I found a new place to finally eat while visiting my parents!  Good for large parties and the prices are good for what you get."}
{"text":"Loved it! Group of 7 of us went for a weeknight dinner. No wait, great service and delicious food. Everyone ordered a version of the Bibimbap and there were no complaints at our table. The wings were also fantastic. Not all of the side dishes were a hit but with refills of the ones we liked, who cares? Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this cute affordable sushi spot! Happy hour is super affordable and staff if so friendly! Owner always offer free ice cream to my kids and that if their favorite part of this experience!"}
{"text":"Best Korean Restaurant I've tried outside of Korea. I travel all of the US and frequent Korean restaurants with my Korean friends. I had the Kalbi Tang for lunch (beef short rib soup). The side dishes were fantastic, and the service was great. In town for the week and will definitely go back for seconds (Korean BBQ next time, it looked so good). Go visit for yourself; you won't be disappointed. Seoul BBQ and Sushi!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were skeptical being how new this place was and very few reviews.  Skepticism is gone! Do yourself a favor avoid the old stodgy institutions in town and come here instead.  Big bonus the staff is all super knowledgeable and very friendly."}
{"text":"Walked over from the hotel next door to pick up some carry out sushi. Perfect in every way, and free soup! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Very elegant place and can be used to impress a date for sure. The waiters are very friendly and their free appetizers are literally 16 different dishes, yes 16!! So don't order much unless you hiked for 3 straight days and then did a marathon and came to the restaurant and only in that case I would still order one thing and see if you are full or not :) their soaps are amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. I would defiantly recommend this to my Korean family. Love that more Korean restaraunts are showing up in Phienix."}
{"text":"Enjoyable Korean experience!! The overall experience with the venue, service, and food was exceptional.   First, Banchan was most extensive with 16 items; I don't recall receiving this many banchan, ever. It included sweet potatoes, egg plant, pickled eggs, and two types of kimchee and many others. The variety seems to vary each day, and I enjoyed eating them every time I visited here.   I have tried bibimbop, bibim nang meon and gunmandu. Bibimbop, with mushroom, spinach, bean sprouts, hit the spot. Bibim nang meon was also right on. Mandu were delicious and not too greasy although deep fried, . The skin was crunch and the stuffing was very tasty. The venue is clean, the service very western (This is a good thing). First class all around! Even bori cha came in a double insulated carafe to keep it warm.  There were a couple of misses unfortunately.  Kimchee was off; perhaps this was intentional for more Western palate. The taste was shallow and sour (closer to sour kraut), and lacked pungent kimchee-ness (you know what I mean?). Also the fish cake was stiff and skinny.   Despite a couple of misses, this was an exceptional dining experience; it deserves 5 stars. An amazing array of Banchan surely deserve 5+ stars. When it is all said and done, despite a couple of misses, I believe this place serves well the general population with \"slightly westernized\" Korean food without losing the core of Korean-ness. \"Highly Recommend\" is my rating for Korean food lovers, korean food novices and my friends."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Foghat - Slow Ride)  Seoul bites, right in Phoenix Seoul bites, right in Phoenix Seoul bites, right in Phoenix Seoul bites, right in Phoenix  I'm in the mood The Japchae is right Move to the Galbi We can eat it all night   I was pretty skeptical of this place when I first saw it.  It was in an area close to a lot of chain restaurants so that was a downer for me.  As I arrived to the place I was somewhat put at ease.  The place was fresh and chilly as in most Korean BBQ places.  It had a beautiful bar plus the place was clean and a modern Asian theme to it.  Moreover, I rather appreciate SeoulPHX since they had a combo selection based on the size of your group.  We ordered the 5 people combo which came with onion pancakes, salad, and tofu soup.  The onion pancakes was bland and lacked textured, but the sauce that came along helped give it some pop; pungent, sweet and spicy all at once.  The tofu soup was okay at best based on the morsel of quantity I received.  I can't speak about it much since the star of the meal came right after; Galbi, Bulgogi and Spicy Pork.  The meats were all well seasoned and I barely used the oil and salt for dipping.  Our waitress would always ask us how we liked our meat temperature which is always a plus; rare indeed please!  The staff was on point that night since after every choice of meat they changed out our grill tops.  This process really helped by keeping the flavors of the type seasoning and meats separated allowing you to taste each to it's full potential.    In the end, SeoulPHX really had something going!  Service was on point, except they need to figure out how to deal with check separation for larger groups; 3 cards per party isn't going to cut it.  The marination of the cuts of meat was solid and overall ambiance was well done! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm by no means is an expert on Korean food having just been introduced recently to the joys of this amazing cuisine, but I know good food and this  is good food.   The restaurant is clean, well decorated with friendly and helpful staff. I've seen a few comments about the servers not knowing about the menu, but  the times I've visited, they've offered suggestions and answered questions. In addition, other servers will help as you need and are very accommodating.  I was surprised when I got a lunch special (I had the bibimap and my friend had the dol-sat bibimap) and we were presented with soup and the sides. I didn't realize that a lunch special would include sides and it was very happy about that because the sides are amazing and one of the perks of Korean food. Our server even brought us more sweet potatoes because they were so good.  Both of our dishes were amazing. The flavors are just perfect in their dishes. Honestly, a few days after my visit, I was craving it again. This is going to be my weekly lunch place.  As far as cost, yes, the lunch special was $11. However, it's a LOT of food. That one lunch gave me two more days of leftovers. For me, the quality of the food is definitely worth it.  And if you can't handle chopsticks (c'mon, give it a try), just request a fork. ;)"}
{"text":"What a great place!! My children & I had sushi & awesome soup with fish ! Everything was so fresh!!  The owner was so wonderful!! I can't wait to go back next spring training!!  GO CUBS!! Thank you, Albert!"}
{"text":"Saw this place as we drove and decided to stop in! So glad we did it was delicious! Table Bbq and sushi we got sushi and it was amazing! A little pricey but worth EVERY penny!"}
{"text":"Love this authentic Korean restaurant that offers a variety of quality dishes! We're from Los Angeles and have tried the most popular Korean BBQ restaurants in LA but this place is by far the BEST! We loved their friendly service, the ambience and most importantly, their food. The 16 side dishes alone can satisfy your palate. Such a feast and fine dining experience we had at Seoul BBQ and Sushi. My wife and daughter enjoyed their fresh sashimi and sushi rolls (especially rainbow rolls) while my son and I savored mouthwatering Galbi, grilled beef brisket, Naengmyeon, and many more. We loved their deep fried dumpling and chicken wings as appetizers.  While staying in AZ, we've gone back several times because of our great dining experience. Try their spicy Chilean sea bass soup and the stuffed boiled Cornish hen with ginseng and vegetables soup. Wow! We wish they can open a restaurant in LA, too."}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful place for Korean bbq.  I have been several times.  It's so good.  We are always treated well and served well.  Love all of the sides, especially the spicy kimchi.  We dream about it all week long and can't keep away."}
{"text":"I have eaten here in a smaller group and the service and experience was great, however today we encompassed 4 large table rooms and we had to ask for water several times before getting it, we didn't get our after meal drink so the 8 people in my section didn't get to experience that wonderful drink.  Food quality and presentation was wonderful. I definitely can't complain about that."}
{"text":"This place is clean, immaculate. Food is big portions, you would need to share. It is pricy. Get the wings & share. Make sure you Get the macaroon dessert out of this world Not a place for kids at all!."}
{"text":"Me and my brother and friend went to Seoul for dinner as we've been wanting to try this place since we have gone to GEN in Tempe and usually go to that location for Korean BBQ. Seoul phx BEATS GEN by so many ways. They explain everything they are giving you and if you have questions they have an answer for you. The food is delicious and the service is great. The only reason why I would give a 4 star is the price and the meats that come in groups should have more of a variety. Thank you for a great night Seoul!"}
{"text":"Very very impressed with their service and quality of food. Beautiful interiors. I will recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Oh my -you must try - it's a great experience ! Delicious & tantalizing if you like bbq & small sides. Don't eat too fast before the Finalee -best bbq pork ! ! Soup is Delishhhh !!  Make sure to pace yourself ...you can always come back !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here on a Friday.  We chose this place because it was supposedly a BBQ house, and we both really enjoy the experience of table-grilling.  However, table-grilling is not available at lunch, but I don't recall the menu stating that and the waitress said nothing either when we placed our order for BBQ pork and BBQ beef.  And I even told the person who seated us that we there for the BBQ. The pre-cooked BBQ plates came with 8 sides dishes, and we also ordered a plate of fried shiumai as an appetizer.  Everything tasted fine but portions were quite dinky, and the $2 charge for extra orders of rice or sides seems highly unreasonable.  Our bill came to $34 with tax+tip (without beverages), and I was hungry again a few hours later.  Overall just mediocre value for the money here so probably no return trip anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and it was okay.  I had the korean spicy pork and my hubs had the ribs.  Both were actually relatively smaller portions - but the ribs were smaller - he was hungry after lunch and I had let him share some of my pork.  The kimchi was good, the pototo side dish was impossible to eat, they were cut so big we had to bit off them like apples, and the rice bowl was pretty but the portion was really small.  The space is amazing and very large - nicely remodeled and new and very clean. Service was excellent.   All in all, I would rather go to the other Koren BBQ nearby with much lower prices and the same qualify of food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars. Service was exceptional. It was my first time here today. 1.11.18 As a foodie: I live in old town Scottsdale. This place puts all those restaurants to shame.  Bringing my family back. What a nice find."}
{"text":"Came across this place from a recommendation by a friend. The restaurant is brand new and immaculate. Hostess was very friendly and waitstaff were excellent and checked on us several times during the meal. The food was possibly the best Korean food I've ever had, no exaggeration. Had the kalbi jim (short rib soup) and the hwe dap bap (like a poke bowl) and both were exceptional. Definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident last night while visiting Phoenix for work. The location is nice and the service was fast and friendly. The owner, Albert, was so nice and talked to me for almost an hour while I ate. Made my solo dinning experience so much better. I ordered the dolsot bi bim bap. It was delicious. The portion size was perfect and with a nice amount of sides. The prices seemed reasonable, if not cheaper than I'm used to in the DC area.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Family of 7 came here for lunch. We stood by the door for super long and all the waiters were just starring and talking to each other. The worse ever. Saw us standing there and still  woukdnt serve us to a tabke. Place was completely empty. Would never go back when I visit AZ"}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ in a very nicely set up & decorated restaurant. It's not cheap, but the food is excellent & all the food is homemade. The most Authentic Korean we've found in Phoenix. More side dishes served with your BBQ than most Korean restaurants. Service was excellent & we got to chat with the manager which was nice. The only thing I think they could improve is that the BBQ should have been set hotter...to sear the meat.  We really enjoyed our meal and will be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely unpleasant experience from the moment we sat down, we should have walked out when we saw the prices. The menu is incredibly intimidating. The dinner comes with \"14 sides\" that they would not tell you what they were till they arrived, all of which looked inedible. Once they described the \"sides\" they then sounded inedible. The meat that arrived looked rancid, and once cooking started smelled rancid. The rice that arrived in a tiny bowl, was marked as an extra cost if you wanted more.... more PLAIN WHITE RICE was extra!!   Once the first round of meat was cooked the flavor was ok, but I would have expected fantastic for the price. I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you have never liked Korean food and think kimchee is horrible, this is the place to come to learn better. Yummy food, nice atmosphere, and terrific service. Korean barbeque at its best. One warning, the amount of food is astounding. Bring extra people or plan on taking some home. Hey, it's good enough that you'll want more the next day."}
{"text":"This was amazing!  I grew up with the ultimate seafood noodle soup that I thought would always have the title, but Seoul BBQ & Sushi's handmade noodles and seafood soup was amazing!  The pan fried rice plate was delicious!  You have not lived unless you eat at this place."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is excellent.  This place offers by far the best Korean side dishes, both in terms of quality and variety.  They rotate the options often, and I'm always looking forward to the pleasant surprises in side dishes."}
{"text":"Family went to dinner and we ordered 5 dishes. The fried rice was good but not enough meat to eat the rice with. They forgot about my dumplings and it wasn't even worth the wait. They were way too oily. The California roll was good.  The beef bone soup and the beef rice combo was not that great. Also the food is SUPER pricey and you can get a better deal at an all-you-can-eat buffet."}
{"text":"We had a great time eating. The servers were friendly and attentive. The portions were good sized and their hot tea (Boricha) helped digesting our food. The only issue I guess was the Las Vegas tempura roll had salmon instead of eel, no big deal. Will come back definitely, thanks!"}
{"text":"Having lived in South Korea, we are always on the lookout for authentic and delicious Korean food here in the US. We heard about this place from a Korean friend who raved about it, so we decided to check it out and are so glad we did. When we walked in they didn't have a table available so we decided to head to the bar and grab a drink while we waited. The bartender that evening turned out to be one of the owners, who absolutely made our experience amazing. He mixed us drinks per our own tastes and then even invented a drink for us to try later on.  The food was delicious and authentic to our experiences in Korea. Lots of delicious varieties of pickled sides, hard to find here in Phoenix. If you haven't had the experience of true Korean BBQ before, this is a great place to start. The staff will walk you through everything. We had a very memorable night and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service! They explain all the side dishes, friendly, and take time to make sure you're enjoying everything. My new favorite place ."}
{"text":"Got the bulgogi and the spicy pork, both were excellent! There was so much banchan, I was in heaven. Wait staff was so nice and helpful. Restaurant was very clean (which isn't always the case at Korean BBQ places) and decor was great. Will definitely be coming back. My only gripe is the meat is a bit more expensive for the portion size, but it was great quality and wasn't grisly. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"We went in as a group of 10 with a reservation. The service was excellent! They greeted us & the manager/owner was even there to help us make choices & introduce us to her staff & the restaurant in general. They put us in a private room that was a little on the small side, but was comfortable. The previous room could only fit 8 comfortably. We asked for a recommendation & were shown some package meal options. I think we got the $99 one and it was perfect. We had several choices of meat to try (which she helped us choose as well. Keep in mind that this isn't our first Korean experience. We've tried Yakiniku in Hawaii, and 2 of the other \"authentic\" well-known Korean restaurants here in AZ. But since this place was new to us AND they had MUCH more food choices than we were used to in a Korean restaurant in general, we thought it would be more efficient to ask for suggestions.) The meal came with soup (I think you can choose from 2 different ones, though there are more on the menu if you buy seperately) salad, and I *think 2 appetizers. We order shrimp siomai (though I'm not sure if that's what its called on the menu) and some kind of \"pancake\". It was all delicious & the kids enjoyed everything as well.  Everyone had their own lidded bowl of rice, and I think you can ask for more. Not sure if its free or not.  The salad was a good amount, but we would have preferred more soup. They brought out only two small/medium sized bowls that we had to share amongst ourselves. We asked for one to be spicy and one not to be spicy. (Spicy definitely tasted FAR superior, though the non wasn't bad. Just obviously not as flavorful.) The banchan was amazing! They gave us SO many, and some I've never had at any of the other Korean restaurants! You can ask for more or less & pick which ones you'd prefer as well. They have a system where you can press a button on the wall if you need them. And the lady in charge welcomed us to call on them as often as we needed. They had 2 servers there cooking the meat & serving us whenever someone needed more food. Once all the meat was cooked, they left us to enjoy the food & company, but made sure to remind us to push the button for anything. The service was excellent, and the food was just as good if not better! We arrived on a Saturday and were the first people there, so maybe that had something to do with it. By the time we left our private room, we noticed that there were many families & couples eating too. For those who care, the restrooms were immaculate and the entire atmosphere was just very enjoyable. Its much more upscale than your favorite hole-in-the-wall Korean place, but I can tell you that its just as good. Sometimes you get quality but they skimp on the quantity ( and vice versa)....but not here! Everything & everyone was ON POINT! If you've got a large crowd and they love Korean soup, I suggest ordering extra if you're buying one of the package deals. But other than that....totally worth the drive and money. (We were coming from Avondale & Goodyear.) My brother & sister in law were actually visiting from Japan and are used to good Yakiniku, and were extremely pleased with this restaurant! We ALL were! Thank you for the wonderful lunch Seoul! I'm praying someone buys me a gift certificate for my birthday & Christmas cause this is definitely my new favorite restaurant."}

{"text":"Ok this is the Korean BBQ spot for us! My mom is from South Korea and was visiting us from California and this was our last night together. I'm so glad we went here, the food was great (just read the other reviews here!) and the service was great too- I have to applaud the young gentlemen in training (I forget his name but I think he was the manager's son) for handling all our requests, letting us know what all the dishes were and even grilling all the meat for us! -Normally when I've been to Korean BBQ houses, they start it off and then leave, but our waiter was so attentive and switched out the pan right when the first round of meat was done.  Oh and the shaved ice-cream deserts - :0! I've never had it that style before. Usually the base is plain shaved ice but this place mixes it with condensed milk so it's like a fine, light ice cream with toppings. I can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Seoul BBQ & Sushi is located on the northeast corner of I17 and Peoria Ave.  They are occupying the space where TGI Friday's used to be. Looks like they did extensive renovations though as no hint of TGI Friday's remains; it's gorgeous inside and out.   They provide very extensive menu from BBQ to stews to salads to sushi. We wanted to try everything on the menu but had to settle with Gamja-tang, soon-tofu, and sashimi salad with kimchee pancake for appetizer. Our order came with table full of banchan, too many to count. It's so amazing that each of these morsels were so tasty. They could open up banchan store and I'd be coming here just for that. Everything is authentic too.   Did I mention they make their own tofu and mandoo (potsticker) from scratch? That was a bonus!   Even though we were full from the side dishes before our entrees arrived, we still managed to taste everything. The kimchee pancake is made fresh had nice bite to it. The stew was amazing. My son said it was the best in Arizona. The sashimi salad was so fresh, tasted like the chef just finished cutting up the vegetables. The sauce paired nicely with the crunchiness of lettuce and cabbage and cold/fresh sashimi. Would definitely get this again to share. The soon-tofu was good (spicy is very spicy though...get medium instead). Needless to say, we had to bring leftovers home. We packed the leftover banchan too!   The service was excellent. They were very attentive. They've been open for about 2 months and still in the process of training new employees but you wouldn't know this from the excellent service we received. They still haven't had official grand opening so I'd definitely try them out before they have lines out the door. We might be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Wow, my husband surprised me with this new place. We had such a great meal and the staff, omg so friendly and of course Albert, one of the owners, what a nice man, very friendly and knowledgeable about everything. A must try! They have pictures on menu for those unfamiliar with Koreon Bbq, lol...."}
{"text":"For a first timer, this is the place to go. But it doesn't end there, my friend from LA who brought me with him for dinner is a longtime lover of Korean BBQ, and according to him LA is the place to be for it, but even he loved it! Let's stick to my review though: the food was great, but I don't have enough experience to compare it to anything. However, I can say it was very flavorful and our server did a good job grilling it up. David (our server) was very knowledgeable, professional, and personable. He answered all of my questions and made suggestions that I could not be happier with. The ambience and environment was very enjoyable, music was at a nice volume, and the bathrooms are SICK. Prices were more than fair for the food we received, let alone the service that came with it. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The pride the owners and staff feel for this restaurant is palpable and truly evident in the food and service. Our dinner was absolutely delicious and it was so much fun to watch our food being cooked in front of us while tasting all the yummy traditional side dishes!! We cannot wait to return and would recommend this fabulous restaurant to all!! Bring the whole family and enjoy a very special dining experience!!!"}
