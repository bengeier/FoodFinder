{"text":"These guys are my goto for street tacos. Asada steak, chicken, pastor pork, and chorizo meats are the choices.  Street tacos start at a buck and are every bit delicious, but he also makes quesadillas and burritos.  The salsa he offers, which comes is 4 varieties ranging from a cool green to a sweet and spicy pineapple Habanero give them a boost of flavor, not that his marinated meats any more flavoring. The taco stand is right in front of the Grove apt complex  and is there most days starting around 4 maybe and open until 8 pm and Friday and Saturday until 10.  TRY THESE GUYS, THERE A MUST!"}
{"text":"These tacos are so good! They came to my apartment complex for the first time so I thought I'd stop by and check it out. I tried the carne asada and shrimp tacos, and oh man I wish I had ordered more! They were so tasty and had so much flavor like tacos should have. The carne asada tacos were only a $1 each and shrimp for $2 each! They're a bit small for some people's standards but they're what street tacos usually look like. Loved them and I hope they come back soon!"}
{"text":"I am very happy to share my review of our experience with Taquizas Kabronis. I give 5 STARS, with no reservations, to Taquizas Kabronis for the most delicious street tacos I've ever had, and their top notch service. They were very accommodating, friendly, organized, on time, professional - everything you would hope for in a caterer and more! We booked Taquitos Kabronis for our son's graduation party and were completely satisfied with our choice. Carlos, the owner, and his family have a very nice cart setup and grills the meat on site. They prepare their tacos to order for guests. He offers several meat options, we chose chicken, beef and Mexican chorizo. GREAT CHOICES! He serves the tacos with several fresh toppings and salsas, and tasty rice and beans. Several of our guests wanted to know who our caterer was. I'm glad he had business cards available to give to them. His food is way to delicious to keep a secret! We have nothing but wonderful things to say about this company. Thank you, Carlos & Co., for helping to make our party such a wonderful success!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying these at a school fair & they were wonderful! We had the beef street tacos & the taco melts.  Will have to look for them now anytime we need a taco fix.  So glad to have found them!"}
