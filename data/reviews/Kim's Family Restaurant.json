{"text":"Very good home cooked items. I try to stay away from the reheated items like gyro meat etc. 

If you are in the mood for breakfast for lunch, $3 will get you full.  

Another plus is this place is privately owned- it needs a makeover for the fancier eaters out there but the honest setting makes the food better."}
{"text":"Nice Resturant for breakfast/lunch. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. We both had omelets and they were good. The resturant is very clean as well."}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes were runny instant with homefries thrown in..roast beef tasted old..will never go back....waitress was efficient and polite..only good thing about this resturant."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get breakfast. You get delicious food, appropriate portions, and the prices are not too bad. The staff has always been nice every time I have gone for breakfast with family and friends. I live very close to Kim's and will continue to go to this restaurant. I will have to try it for lunch or dinner. Everyone should try Kim's restaurant. Good place!"}
{"text":"After getting off the Toll Road looking for a Hometown restaurant....we were disappointed because the one we picked had changed names...and most of the others we saw were closed, or not Home Cooking...we then asked a local resident at the Service Station, and they recommended Kim's ....What a nice place, the waitress was so friendly with her big smile and the service was wonderful.  The food was tasty and we got so much for our money....Soup, Salad, Vegetables, Potatoes, Meat, are all included, and generous helpings....we were then too full to enjoy the pie that sounded so yummy.....It is worth a trip off the toll road for this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is probably the best diner in North Ridgeville. I've tried City Diner and Our Place which are also on Center Ridge but Kim's blows them both out of the water. Upon arrival we are always seated quickly. Servers are always polite, courteous, and accurate. The owner is also often in the restaurant and is very friendly and welcoming. The food is great, they have a good selection, for great prices. There is something for everyone. They also have a great menu section with regular meal options, but with smaller portions at a reduced price. I can never eat a full portion from a restaurant so I really appreciate this option. I never leave Kim's feeling I've over payed.  This is always my first choice for breakfast or a quick meal."}
{"text":"I found my new restaurant for breakfast!  The food was great.   The service was great.   I got the brunch burger.... Definitely a must try.   Also got a chance to meet the owners.  They were so nice and welcoming.  Definitely a must try if you are in the North Rdgeville area!"}
{"text":"We go for breakfast every weekend at Kim's! We have their fabulous pancakes which are better than any other restaurant pancakes I've tried... Soft and tasty, generous portions... pancake heaven! Their omelettes are very good too! Service was always fast and courteous! I think it's safe to say that going to Kim's in the weekend is a new family tradition!"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was horrible. My boyfriend got a very bland burger and my meal (turkey with mashed potatoes and gravy) tasted like dogfood. The smell the gravy was repulsive enough but the taste was worst. We probably won't come back as I would be too scared to try anything else."}
{"text":"My first check in but I have been here many times. This place is always clean and the servers fast and polite. The food is a little better than other places in this price range."}
{"text":"So my family tried Kim's one last time. We got the same rude waitress with the same slow service. They were busy but it took close to an hour for the food to come for four people. This restaurant has lost all concept of customer service. We are officially done with Kim's."}
