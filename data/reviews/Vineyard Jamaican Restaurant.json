{"text":"Love the home cook authentic menu! It's a very nice place to sit for lunch with clients as well!"}
{"text":"Always good and I'm a regular! There special's are great!!! Delicious Jamaican food for a great price! Ambience so so but the service and taste make up for that :)"}
{"text":"Food is very good. The jerk (chicken and pork) have a good heat and flavor to them. The rice and peas are good too. My favorites are the ox tail and the ackee and salt fish. 

Place loses a star for the bit of attitude from the server. The Brampton location gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing bang for your buck! If you ever want a home cooked Caribbean meal in Bolton then this is the place to go. My only complaint is it's not quite as spicy as I'd like (but I assume they cater towards the majority of their local clientele who is of Caucasian decent). I always do take-out so I can add my own pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Never thought there were that good food options in Bolton, stumbled across this and was proven wrong. 

It's in a strip plaza kinda hard to see but was it ever delicious. Had the jerk pork and got the small to dine in, can't imagine what the large would be as the portion size was huge. 

The pork was juicy and had a nice kick, the rice and peas were fresh and the coleslaw wasn't drained in dressing like most places, it was clean and crisp with great flavour. 

Will definitely return. 
Highly recommend for jerk lovers."}
{"text":"The girl at the front was absolutely rude and unhelpful. The menu was not posted anywhere, so we had to look online - they didn't have half of what was there either (no plantains, pea stew or roti). The jerk chicken and pork was okay, the rest of the food was unsatisfying and overcooked. Overall, wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Vineyards is a cozy little restaurant that offers Caribbean cuisine. I had the jerk chicken with Jamaican style rice, and beans. The chicken was incredible, very juicy with the right amount of spices that gave it a nice kick, but not over powering. It was made to perfection. The only thing I was disappointed with was the coleslaw, it was dry, it needed more mayo, but thats personal taste. The service was fast, and friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I only had the jerk chicken so far, but I definitely plan on going back to try other choices on the menu."}
{"text":"As Jamaican restaurants go, this one was pretty good. While on a recent business trip to Bolton, I stumbled across this restaurant while I was visiting another store in the shopping center where it is located. I came to this restaurant twice that week. The first night I tried the oxtail and it was wonderful. The second night I came, I had the jerk chicken. Both dishes were served with rice and pigeon peas with gravy along with a coleslaw. The restaurant is fairly small seating approximately 25 to 30 people. You order your food from a window primarily and they will deliver the food to your table. I'm looking forward to being back in Bolton and coming back to the vineyard restaurant to try some more of their wonderful Jamaican food."}
{"text":"My first visit and it will not be last. Ox Tail with rice was excellent. Curry chicken was tasty and the jerk chicken was the best I've had in a long time. 
The restaurant is small but comfortable. My waitress was very friendly and was helpful with information about the menu items.
Oh and make sure to grab some Coconut Drops. A very tasty coconut and ginger treat."}
{"text":"Went once and the food was good but a bit salty. The service was so-so. Went back a second time to order and was really disgusted with the girl behind the counter as she was changing her socks and picking lint from her toe in front of me and felt no way about it!!! GROSS!! Then proceeded to ask what I wanted to order and serve me food without washing her hands or giving her behaviour a second thought!! DOUBLE GROSS!! Of course I left without ordering a thing!!
I will never go back - Ever!!"}
{"text":"I walked in mid-afternoon, did not see a person in sight. The music was on and the place looked pretty good. Problem was I stood there alone trying to figure out if anyone was actually working. I continued to stand by the half wall in the entrance waiting for someone to come out and ask dine in or take out?. Finally, after what seemed a long minute, I saw someone moving around in a cut out located off the side around the corner leading to the hallway....you'd need to know this or you may find yourself leaving due to lack of people running out to help you.

I can see why the comments for poor service, the person that took my order was uninspired and made no effort to accommodate anything without being pressed, despite telling her it was my first time there and needed help. I could not understand why I had to order at the cash in order to dine in??  Pretty sure made it clear I wanted to sit and try a few things, yet, I was told to order at the cash, got a Styrofoam container with my food, plastic fork & knife and sat myself.  Even stranger was not 5 mins later, someone else came in, went to the cash, then sat in the dining room table where he was fully catered to and served food, ate with a real plate and full cutlery...Awkward?!.

That aside, I had the Jerk Chicken/Curry Goat combo plate for $16.50 (all in). The food was tasty, Chicken and Goat were tender, rice and beans cooked perfectly and slaw was slightly bland. Overall the flavors were pleasant not too strong/spicy, The large portion plate included 4pcs of chicken and the goat filled the smallest void in the tray, Largest portion was rice and beans. I found they were pricey for the size and some of the dishes and Roti was higher than I expected,($15) so I did not order them. Overall, good food, price on the high end, service non-existent (in my case)."}
