{"text":"Authentic Thai food! Don't let the location scare you away from trying this little gem. The food is delicious, the restaurant is clean, and the employees are very friendly. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I order a Mongolian Beef lunch special to go. Flavor was ok, not great. But too watery that felt more like an stew , instead of an stir fry. Portion size for that $5.99 lunch special didn't satisfy me . I wish they had charge me $1 or $2 more and give me a decent portion.  Service was pleasant and friendly.The place looked clean. I will probably be back to try something else, but I dont think I will be getting their Mongolian Beef again."}
{"text":"Food is so good! Their water has pandan flavor which is very nice. Cash only for now."}
{"text":"I Love they Rad Nar, sausage , Lao papaya Salads, and ice water smell like flowers must try!!!  ...  Last one... server very nice tooo"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, and within a short drive of Nellis AFB. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Had lunch and dinner here a few times now.  Never disappointed with anything I was served. The lunch special is by far the best deal ever.  12 bucks for 2 full meals. Come on, no one else can beat that. Pad Thai is on point so is the papaya salad."}
{"text":"I dont usually leave a review but i had to this time...  This is BEST thai restaurant. and the price is nice too.   I know i can not resist to not to stop by here whenever i pass by! don't forget check in and get free thai tea. this is bomb too!! I had to get one more"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Yes their portions are on the smaller side but I would rather sacrifice size for substance any day. It's better to have a small bowl of high quality authentic Thai food than a giant portion of crap that you will probably throw away after it's been in the fridge for a few days. I personally like the smaller portions because it allows me to buy a few dishes and sample all of them. It's really difficult to find an authentic Thai place (I'm from Thailand) and I'm glad one opened up on this side of town."}
{"text":"This would be a good restaurant but they seem to be unorganized and very slow. And please tell them to get rid of those drink napkins...invest in your restaurant and buy regular dining napkins"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place was awesome, most definitely will be going back. The portions were a good size for the price, and a dollar and some change for a bomb Thai iced tea  can't beat that. I had the Pad Thai and it was delicious"}
{"text":"The food was great!  They are very popular with the local area!  They need more help though, that's a good thing!! But the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick. I got the yellow curry with tofu and some spring rolls. Curry was awesome, I'd recommend a extra side of rice though. The spring rolls were very good as well especially with the peanut sauce that comes with them."}
{"text":"One of the best thai place in North Las Vegas. We were browsing yelp and saw that they just opened up. Went to order a bunch of food from yelp 24 and our food was ready in 20 mins. Upon arrival to the restaurant, we noticed that we forgot to order some dessert so we added two boba tea. They were so nice to give it to us for free since we ordered a lot.  Servings are pretty huge. Come here hungry or just come and have a lot of leftovers for the next few days.  My personal favorite is the duck curry - Authentic taste and very delicious.  The staff are very friendly and they make you feel comfortable like you are in your home eating your mom's cooking. They asked us where we're from, where we live and we told them that we live on base which basically is across the street. They said that they will deliver up to the gate (since they can't come in on base) and that makes it easier and faster to get food. Just call them and tell them to deliver your food in front of the gate and they'll be more than happy to deliver it to you warm and fresh.  This will definitely be our hang out / late night craving, getting sober spot.! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"To say this place is a \"hole in the wall\" is no exaggeration. It's located next to a car wash and in front of a car repair shop. The side entrance makes it hard to spot from Craig Rd. Inside you'll find a total of 5 tables for dining in. So how's the food? Good. I had the Pad See Ew which was yummy although I asked for it to be medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all. My friend had the lunch special BBQ pork which was also good. We started with the pot stickers (over fried and hard) and the scallion pancakes which wasn't a pancake at all. It was big puffy pastry triangles that were tasteless. Skip both of these appetizers. Overall the food was good with the exception of the appetizers. The service was fast and friendly. I would recommend and will most likely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious and very authentic Thai  cuisine! I highly recommend this restaurant! Reasonably priced menu! I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This recently opened spot is conveniently located on Craig Rd., directly across the street from NAFB Housing -- which is a stone-throw from our home -- which is why we decided to drop in. The food is okay, the service is quick, and (probably) serves its purpose more-so as a quick lunch menu, rather than higher-end 'Amazing Thai' type of spot -- which is why they got 4 Stars. However, their Beef Pad Thai was exceptional -- which is what saved their rating."}
{"text":"I had to check out this new Thai restaurant on Craig near Nellis AFB. The price is reasonable and the food was very good. I'm glad I've made the choice of venturing to this new restaurant. It's small but well decorated. Good food good price."}
{"text":"Sooo good!!!! I got yellow curry and orange chicken and ordered off the yelp app delivery service I was impressed everything thing was great only sad thing is they don't have crab Rangoon but I will definitely be ordering again very very good"}
{"text":"Wow! Great lunch menus with very reasonable prices. One of the best pad Thai in town. Very nice friendly polite staff"}
{"text":"So First time ordering from here and let me start by  saying all the food I ordered was amazing!!!  I ordered the  -shrimp house rice which was amazing my husband ate it all, plus the shrimp were clean and cooked perfectly.  -  Pad See-Eu was also very delicious, noodles were perfectly cooked and had a lot of flavor!!    Massaman Curry- it was so good, have never tasted this but I when I asked the man who works there he recommended it and I tried it and it was the best thing ever!!  It does have more of a sweet taste but it has lots of flavor.  The man who took my order was very nice and took his time explaining everything!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Clean place. The entire family enjoyed all of it - pad thai, chicken satay, beef panang, spicy basil eggplant, lemongrass BBQ pork and coconut sticky rice. I read the other reviews. Portions may be smaller in comparison to other places but they were definitely decent given the prices of each dish.  I believe is was a fair price for the portion. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this awesome restaurant a couple times already after first finding it about 3 weeks ago. So to start they can make their Thai Tea vegan (w/coconut milk) and it is delicious! I have asked for a couple entrees to be made without fish sauce so they can be vegan and everything so far has been very tasty, unfortunately the Pad Thai cannot but there is a ton of other great options. This spot is not in the most beautiful area but the interior is very modern in design and it's cute little place. Customer service is consistently phenomenal and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"They have a nice variety of menu items. Food is always great. Friendly servers. We also love ordering take out since we live nearby. Can't beat that their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant. We really enjoyed the food and the prices were great. It's a great place either to eat lunch or to eat dinner. The folks running the restaurant were very nice and kept checking at the table to make sure that everything was OK. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Glad we found this place. Sketchy neighborhood but excellent food! The golden rolls were amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything was great I had the yellow curry and my lady had the pad thai noodles lunch specials awesome prices great flavor the only reason why I didn't give them a five-star was because I found a piece of Teflon pan in my food. Definitely worth checking out it's just a little hole-in-the-wall with very little seating..no where to park either..lol I parked across the street."}
{"text":"Hidden gem...Awesome authenic food at great prices!!! Staff is extremely friendly. Food comes out quick!"}
{"text":"I order takeout here often ever since it opened. It was convenient, good food, & affordable. The past few times I've done so, I've noticed that their portions have gotten smaller. Well I ordered takeout again yesterday & definitely noticed a difference that the portion was much smaller. This was one favorite place to go but now I'm not so sure what's going on. Definitely disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were in N Las Vegas for a work project and there are not a lot of good dining options where we were posted up.  Then! We found Narong's Thai Kitchen ~ it's a hole in the wall spot in a weird shopping plaza but the food is LEGIT!  Thai iced tea (they'll put coconut milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2) YUM Darn close to the best Cashew Gai we've had! Pik nam pla with fresh chilis is great over their pad see ew The crispy spring rolls were okay...  Service was wonderful and they were very accommodating!  Next year when we return for the project we now have our favorite spot for thai!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are amazing! I wish I could eat 20 of them. This is a hidden gem near Nellis AFB."}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing Thai food and come on a regular basis. Pot stickers and the yellow curry are my favorites."}
{"text":"We now order for delivery at least once a week. Golden rolls, super bomb. Pad thai, bomb. Green curry, Massaman curry, bomb. Spicy basil chicken/rice, bomb. Gyoza, super bomb. thai tea...super bomb. I really don't like reviewing places but I know reviews always help the business, especially small places like these."}
{"text":"Had the pad thai and the green curry -- this place has brilliant flavors. I didn't quite feel like crying after having the food like one other reviewr mentioned, but I could definitely understand where that sentiment comes from. This place is authentic and you can tell they use the proper and best ingredients.   I think people have started to hear about the great food because by the time we got there, the tables they had were already filled. It's a small, hole-in-the-wall type of place with about four tables inside. They market themselves as a take-out place, likely because they can't house many people inside. We came in with another group ahead of us who took the last table, but we were happy to take our food to-go. The girls who took our order mentioned that it make take a bit of time to get our order out, which was appreciated. The food took about 20 minutes to get to us, which is a wait but it was worth it.  Honestly, I would wait however long it would the chef to make the meal. If they told me it would take 30 minutes, I wouldn't complain. It's that good. It's also very well priced. Perhaps too well priced. They could easily get me to pay more for the meal. Tip this restaurant!! We're from out of town but we'd love to visit again when we're back, so Las Vegas it's your job to continue the patronage to this amazing place!"}
{"text":"This spot is usually packed probably because the food is great! Always taste like its made with fresh ingredients! but have to always order i ridiculously high # for the spiciness other wise it will taste like a 2....0 being no spice and 1o being \"very\" hot...another thing, always check your order when picking up they're always so busy 4 out of 6 times they've missed something with my order."}
{"text":"I've been here once before. I ordered the Pad Thai dish with tofu and also got my free Thai iced tea! The pad Thai was a great sized portion which can easily feed 2 people. It has really good flavor also! I get number 2 or 3 on the spicy scale."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall Thai place. I had a bit of a hard time finding it and finding parking.  It's worth it. I ordered the massama curry and the sauce is perfect. Rich and creamy. I will definitely come back to try other things."}
{"text":"The beef salad, pad Thai, Garlic Rice and Thai tea is the best! Reminds me of Archie's but close to home.... love love love their food! Thank you for serving customers on the North on of town"}
{"text":"This now our,favorite Thai restaurant  all food is deliciously prepare and totally good ,we my son and I just had our home built not far from here and we discover Narongs by good luck and very happy we did..5 stars.."}
{"text":"excellent thai food! lemongrass chicken wings were tasty and satisfied my picky teenager. drunken noodles were spicy and delicious. would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! You definitely get a bang for your buck. My hubby and I got so much yummy delicious food for under 20.00 during lunch we will definitely be back. The inside is really nice, up to date  and clean. Great customer service too! I'm so glad they built their restaurant so close to the base too. It's hard to find yummy options right outside the gate. I can't wait to brag about them to everyone. Be sure to stop by you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Just order again and their crispy noodle dish is pretty disappointing. It's not real fried noodles. They used that garnish stuff that comes in a can, or it looks like it. Thus, the noodles don't soak up the gravy. So it's like I'm having gravy soup instead of pan fried noodles  =("}
{"text":"I go here about once every week to get my pregnant Thai food fix.  Usually the service is great and the food is good. Today however was not one of those days.  I walk in see there's no tables so I politely sit down and wait my turn. Couple of minutes later a family walks in. They get seated before me after I waited for 10 minutes. The server acknowledges me and ask me if I want a water while I wait. I'm annoyed but thankful that he asked if I needed anything while waiting. I tell him I'm good and I'll wait, thank you. After 16 more minutes of waiting they seated another group before me. The server came up to me at this point because I'm sure he could tell I'm furious and he said it'll be just awhile longer...I told him I'm good and left.  I'm so disappointed with this place I understand it's more money to seat a group with four people versus just seating one individual but come on twice in a row. :  Update: 2-20-18 I'm updating my review after I went in today for a pickup. The server was there that I had seen my last visit and I have never seen anyone so apologetic from my last visit! Definitely made me feel like they meant it! It's rare for company's to go out of their way to make sure you come back again! Plus my curry was delicious!! Thank you"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED! I order delivery last night about 6:45 Pm. The delivery time was 45 minutes to an hour. After an hr and 20 minutes, with no call or no show I reached out to the chat to see where my food was. The first person I was disconnected from so I had to reach out AGAIN, by now TWO HOURS has passed and still NO. food, no call nothing. I call the restaurant and the guy that answers apologized and tells me his driver left and hour ago to delivery my food. Mind you I am 10 minutes away from the place and the only reason I didn't go out is because I'm sick. So now the guy on the phone tells me he is going to call me right back after he calls his driver, two minutes later I have a call back and the guy tell me that his driver said he already delivered the food, which he didn't! Three minutes later the drive shows up with Freezing cold food! I tell the guy on the phone about the food being cold, once again another apology followed by a promise that I'll get a refund and a hit Order re delivered right away. Here we are the next day NO FOOD, NO REFUND! And when I called back last night to see what was taking so long, the restaurant was closed for the night!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and it is always awesome. We have had the pad Thai, cashew chicken, lemongrass bbq pork and several of the fried rice varieties. Do yourself a favor and try the chicken satay and the crab fried rice, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of authentic and delicious Thai food right outside the Nellis gate! The restaurant is quaint with a great selection of Thai food and drinks. Everything I've eaten thus far has exceeded expectations (and a little spicier than normal!)"}
{"text":"Just first visit Narong's Thai Kitchen which located close on Nellis Air Force Base. This small restaurant is so fantastic with an easy outgoing atmosphere, good Thai food and great taste and special nice services. Check it out guys"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to see this cool little Thai eatery appear on Craig Road, just a short distance west of Nellis AFB.  The staff appears to be the same few people each time.  They're so kind and seem genuinely happy to greet every customer as they come in.  Narong's is not a big place and has somewhat limited seating, but there's enough for several groups of two or four, and they're very willing to move tables together to accommodate a larger party.  The lunch specials are tasty and diverse enough that you'll find something you like, and the larger menu is definitely full of Thai favorites.  You're not limited to the specials at lunch, so wade in and find what you like.  The couple dishes I've had so far tell me I'm going to like the entire menu.  My first visit I had the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and a Thai Tea.  My next visit I had the Pad See-Ew (and a soda).  Both dishes were delicious, nothing was very served very spicy, and there are the typical racks of sauces and peppers on the tables to share.  I'm sure if you don't see what you want, they'll bring it to you if they have it.  The price and portions are definitely right on target:  you get enough to feel satisfied without emptying your wallet.  You can also order food to go, and it appears they participate with Uber Eats.  (They had the bags behind the counter.)  Parking is somewhat limited and a little awkward since there's an old self-serve car wash right in the middle of the lot.  People seem to park in there though, as well as along the wall to the south side of the lot.  Don't miss that there are also several spots right in front of the restaurant alongside the wall of the carwash.  Narong's is a new lunchtime favorite and I definitely hope it thrives!  If they keep up what they're doing, there's really no reason for it not to continue down the path of being one of those awesome little gems you love to discover.  Swing by and give it a try."}
{"text":"OH. MY.GOD. This place is a game changer. This place blows everyone out of the park. My boyfriend told me about this place when he came here with a couple friends. We came here for dinner with our cousin and his baby. I'm surprised with the size of this place. They only having a seating capacity of 16, so you can imagine how small it is. They are well decorated inside and out. They put a lot of details and thoughts to not only the interiors, but also the food. We ordered fried garlic rice, a side of cucumber salad, chicken satay, pad see ew, steamed chicken with ginger rice, and garlic chicken rice plate.   I can literally eat pots and pots of their fried garlic rice. It is soooooo amazing yet super simple. It packs so much flavor. Even the baby loved the rice. The cucumber salad was delicious and well dressed. Just everything was well seasoned and scrumptious. I definitely ate sooo much that I had no choice but to take food home. And the best part was that all that food only cost us $35. We ordered three entrees, three apps and two hot teas. What a steal!!! Definitely the place to be!"}
{"text":"My wife and I was thrilled to find this place. It just opened and we thought we would try it. We were delighted with every dish we ordered. Those who love Thai food, this is the restaurant you need to try. The atmosphere is nice. And the food is great. It is a little scary outside but don't let it scare you away from this places great food"}
{"text":"Searching for places that deliver and this was a new restaurant added to the list and decided to give it a try.  We received our food in 35min (when everywhere else takes about an hour to get food).  Maybe that was just luck, but it was a plus on my end.     We ordered: Chicken Pad Thai / Chicken Tom Kha / BBQ pork ribs on rice and chicken wings  I can't tell you how good the food was, portions were a good size, price is cheaper than any other Thai place around us, and everything we ordered was just so yummy, so yummy that this will be our go to Thai food from now on.    I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food right by Nellis Air Force Base. Amazing lunch special for like $6-7! Can't beat those prices and the taste doesn't disappoint. The location is in a somewhat sketchy part of town but don't let that influence you from shying away from this place, the food is legit."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, tasty food , owners/servers excellent service! SUPER clean restaurant, great prices! What a little gem! We've eaten from here once a week twice the first time, everything on the menu Yummoh!"}
{"text":"It's tucked away in a corner right off Craig Road with a sign that says \"Thai Food\" right next to a mechanic place. Tiny hole in the wall restaurant with an amazing selection of food that tastes like some of the better places I had in Thailand. Prices are low to medium ($8-11 typically) and portion size is medium, so don't expect massive Chinese food style dishes, more like the authentic portion sizes with just a tad bit more. Definitely worth going, arguably the best Thai I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here was pretty good.  It was much closer to base than the other one down Nellis so that's a plus. Lunch special pricing was great (5.99) and the portion size for my Pad Thai was adequate. I would've liked a few more bites but at the price I can't really complain.   Couple things I noticed were missing from the dish that would've made it better was peanuts as a garnish. Also they didn't ask if I cared for a specific spice level. Most Thai places I've been to normally asks but I made due with the spices and jalapeños on the table.   I would definitely recommend this spot to try out for their lunch specials and close proximity to base."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant that I have had in a long time I had papaya salad and yum woon seen both were delicious and my wife had lemongrass bbq chicken and fried rice she said it was the best she has eaten"}
{"text":"Truly awesome green curry and Thai tea. Eating here would be reason enough to visit the Vegas area. So many other menu items looked good, but I needed to be quick, so I chose something I'm familiar with. Very helpful and friendly staff, too. It is a very small place. I came at 8pm, so it was quite empty. A little difficult to find, but definitely worth searching out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here! I am just disappointed that today is the third time I have called in an order and they have given me a time to pick up and it's still at least a 30 minute wait to get our to go order! So I highly suggest going in and ordering bc they won't start the food till you get there anyways which makes it inconvenient when you have time constraints which is the last 2 times I have called in a to go order."}
{"text":"This is our go to. We have learned that when we order our seafood salad to just ask for extra greens. They do their best to accomodate always and this last time I ordered, it was a delivery order.   The gentleman forgot our Boba Tea. After I had seen that I wasn't charged for it, I told him to forget it, it was really no big deal ( saved me the calories, right).   Well he left and returned and brought me my Boba at no additional charge.   That's awesome customer service and it is probably why we keep on coming back. Well that and they are probably the only Thai restaurant that make us cry with every bite! lol"}
{"text":"Food is amazing reminds of the places back in DC mad NYC. Great spice level all around really affordable get a lot more then expected for the price paid and the quality matched would definitely recommend for anybody if craving Thai food on this side of town only complaint would be delivery takes a little but we did order on a Friday would recommend if possible pick up instead of delivery. Overall great food and customer service will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Don't let the outside fool you! The inside is super cute. We got the pad se ew, duck noodle, potstickers, and calamari. This will definitely be our go to Thai place."}
{"text":"Narong's Thai.. What else do I have to say.  Most dope and cheap Thai spot I've been to.  The lunch combos are amazingly cheap and delicious.  One of the best kept secrets of North Las Vegas and best part...  Free Thai Tea when you check in on yelp!!"}
{"text":"This Thai is outstanding. All the curries are good. The fried Rice's, drunken noodles are delicious. All in all the food is amazing and well located near Nellis. My one critique is they should layout the restaurant with 2-person tables and they could fit more people in for lunch. They need additional help during the busy lunch hour when the wait drags on for 45 minutes to an hour. But the chef is cooking up some really good Thai food."}
{"text":"The best hole in a wall I've found in North Las Vegas. This Thai restaurant was good and I'm glad that I didn't judge a book by its cover this time lol. It's not located in the safest area of Craig Road, but it's right across from the military housing if that makes you feel better lol. Parking is small but you can park in front of the restaurant closer to the car wash. When you walk in the place is surprisingly clean and cozy with modern decor. The menu is extensive, they have a lot of good choices.  We ordered -combo pad see eu  -chicken pad Thai -thai tea -garlic rice -beef jerky -chicken satay  Everything was delicious! The Thai tea was the best, made nicely and not too sweet for my taste. For apps we had the garlic rice, beef jerky, and chicken satay. I would come here just to order the garlic rice, it's my favorite thing ever and I could eat a whole bowl of it (no raaaagrets). Also doesn't hurt that it's just as good as Nittaya's garlic rice except for half of the price ($3.95 for a bowl at Narong's). I enjoyed the beef jerky it was chewy (not in a bad way) and flavorful. I didn't have a lot of the chicken satay but my friends said it was good. They use a chunky dipping sauce for it here, and the cucumber salad it comes with is refreshing. For entrees we shared the pad thai and pad see eu. They were both good! I usually never order pad see eu because it is too sweet of an entree for me, but theirs was not that sweet. I liked the way the cooked their noodles too. The pad thai was good I got a level 4/10 and it had a good kick to it. We were too full for dessert but next time I'll make sure to have room.  Would definitely recommend this place, especially if you live in North Las Vegas because it's hard to find good food places around here!"}
{"text":"Simple dishes. Reminds me a lot of Bangkok.  My crispy chicken with rice was delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered the Thai Beef Salad and Chicken Fried rice, cucumber salad and the potstickers.  All were exceptional.  We are only in town for two days but decided to come back for lunch.  We ordered Mongolian Pork and Drunken noodles with chicken.   Both again were amazing.  The staff is super friendly.  I would come back here often if we lived here.    Love this place!!!  Pictures are from lunch.  We didn't get any of dinner because we were so hungry and it was really good."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here on a whim and it was a great decision! When you check in on Yelp you get a free Thai tea, and it was the best Thai tea I've had in awhile. Upon first impression, the outside of the restaurant doesn't look like the most inviting place, but when you walk inside it's actually a very cute place with relaxing music. The service was very quick, we ordered our food and within less than 10 minutes they had our orders hot and ready. I ordered the chicken pad Thai, it had a bit of sweetness that was balanced out with savory chicken. There was enough food for me to get full at lunch and save half of it for lunch the next day. The prices were fair as well. I would go here again, but only with a small group as the facility only has a few tables."}
{"text":"Hell yes.. The pot stickers are amazing Go here.. get a lunch special and pot stickers... leave full and happy"}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant! Yummy dishes and perfect amount of food for the price. We live on base and they are Iiterally across the street so pick up or delivery is super convenient and quick.  Highly recommend this place for fresh and flavorful Thai food!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem, not far from Nellis AFB. We got the chicken pad Thai, dumplings, fried rice and chicken satay-all was delicious! Will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Good specials. Not a lot of meat but still get a bunch of things with it. The fried banana ice cream was delicious"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  It definitely satisfied my Thai craving! Really good service and Thai tea!"}
{"text":"The location was not the best but the dood was outstanding..  was super suprised and will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the place was clean and I really like the modern tables and chairs with the unpainted brick walls. Was very surprised to find how nice it was on the inside because the outside and location is well... a little \"hood.\"   I order Thai tea and an order of pad Thai. Tea was a little sweet (nothing melting ice wouldn't take care of) but was really good none the less. Pad Thai was yummy and portion was filling, I'll be having some for a snack later.   Any how, I will be going back for more. This is the only Thai placed anywhere near that area and I'm so happy that it's good!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving.....this places food is AMAZING and way under priced it was easily worth double what I paid  I can't praise the cook enough  Thank you thank you thank you"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. Definitely authentic and reasonably priced. Great service. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This place has decent food but the customer service is horrible. I've been there a few times and every time I go the girl that works the front counter is rude. The most frustrating incident I had with them was when I ordered duck curry online and I realized when I got home they gave me chicken. I called and told them and the same rude girl that works the front said \"okay keep it and we'll make new one\" therefore I kept it at home and drove all the way there. Once I got there I showed my receipt and the manager said I needed to bring the food. I told her that I asked the girl on the phone if I need to bring it and she said no keep it... the manager even agreed that she heard her say \"keep it\" on the phone but she still told me she can't give me the duck. I honestly couldn't believe it I didn't let it get it to me I just told them that that's not good customer service and left."}
{"text":"I order pai thai seafood, was definitely worth the try.  Honestly the area the restraunt in had me judging this place.  But the food speaks for its self. Top 5 of best pad thai's I ever had in or out thailand."}
{"text":"Parking here was kind of inconvenient and limited. I was confused with the parking at first but figured it out. They were busy so I placed a to go order. I checked in on yelp for my free Thai ice tea and it was delicious. I got the Mongolian lunch special here. It was yummy but I would say the lunch portion is pretty small so if you're hungry then order just the normal order. I didn't care for the egg roll, I much prefer spring roll which I thought was included but they must be confused with the two words because in the menu it says spring instead of egg. It's egg roll that they give you in the lunch special not spring roll. The staff here was very friendly and nice. The seats inside the restaurant is also very limited so if you want to eat here, you'll probably have to wait for seats and don't bring big groups here because I think the most they can seat is like 6. Overall food is good and service is great."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place in Vegas. I've tried a couple others but nothing beats their prices and usually pad thai's from other places are dry. Their spice levels aren't really ever as spicy as I want cause I tend to want my mouth to fall off but it's still delicious lol. My favorite dish is their spicy basil rice plate! Their location is sketchy but it's worth it I promise :-)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I ordered had placed a delivery from Narong's Thai Kitchen, both times the food was amazing. This time I had ordered their Beef Pad See Eu, Lemongrass Pork and Pot stickers."}
{"text":"Small place but I really like this place for a small quick meal ! Not too bad on price since their portion isn't so much . Especially with this check on here for that free Thai iced tea"}
{"text":"I wanted Thai food tonight. We went in and we're greeted with very friendly customer service. We ordered the Fried Pork Belly,  Brocolli Pork, and The Fried bananas... Wow..I was thoroughly satisfied with the atmosphere, food, and service. Will most def recommend this place. Parking is not ample so get creative as the food is worth it. Not far from the base at all."}
{"text":"Great hidden hole in the wall gem! The location on the outside is a bit rough, wedged between the self serve carwash and the tattoo parlor. Lunch special is starting at $5.95! We had green curry chicken and red curry chicken. Both we're outstanding. Definitely a great lunch or casual option. Not a date place. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery from here numerous times--always quick and the correct order! Also super well priced!"}
{"text":"Great food. Everyone here is really nice, especially the tall skinny guy, I never got his name but he is always there. Not sure if he owns the spot but great customer service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! The only issue was that I didn't get the chicken wings I paid for ! However, that's partially my husbands fault for not verifying the order prior to leaving . All in all excellent Thai food, and it will definitely be a weekly to bi-weekly treat!"}
{"text":"I was in North Las Vegas with my husband who was doing a training course. I was feeling under the weather and decided to get some comfort food takeout. Narong's has some great reviews and it was around the corner from our hotel so we decided to give it a try. It's definitely a hole in the wall from the front, but cute and quaint with friendly service when you walk through the door. This place was AMAZING! We live in LA where there is some great Thai food back home, but Narong's blows them all out of the water. Not something I expected out in North Las Vegas, but definitely a highlight of our trip.   We had potstickers, which were flavorful and perfectly sauced. The combination drunken noodles were fantastic and perfectly seasoned. And the chicken yellow curry was outstanding. I could have drank the sauce straight out of the container. I got a check-in for a free Thai iced tea but it was forgotten, so I can't give my opinion on the tea. However I am willing to overlook this small oversight because the food was impeccable and the service fast and friendly. Maybe next time I'm in the area I can give my opinion, because If I'm ever in the area, I will definitely be back.   There's a military discount available if you pay cash, so be sure to ask if you are military. Discount or not, the prices are good. There were some reviews saying the portions were small, but I didn't find that to be the case. We have leftovers of everything but the rice. If there's anything that was a small portion, it was the rice, so maybe order extra if you get a curry.   All in all an amazing meal! One of the best I have had in a long time. I can not recommend it enough."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim before our movie. Since moving to Vegas from NYC, I've  had a hard time coping with the difference in general, overall, Asian cuisine and the like. Having been disappointed too many times to count I was definitely treading lightly when I  placed my order. I always test a new Thai place by ordering the drunken noodle and scallion pancakes.... everyone has their barrometer dish, amiright? ANYWAY, It didn't disappoint at all! I sensed a very traditional spice vibe when ordering, and kept it at a 5 for my gweilo self (please note that I enjoy very spicy food) and TBH I'm probably going 4 next time, but I enjoyed every bite!   My boyfriend got the massaman curry and it was also perfectly executed! Spice level 5, chicken and shrimp. Fuego! So delicious! The coconut helped tame some of the sweet heat, but again it wasn't overpowering and I was grateful he let me have a bite before inhaling it.  The service was great! Again, coming from the NYC restaurant world I have essentially zero expectations when walking into a tiny establishment that I assume predominantly does take-out, bc it's easier that way. But these girls were awesome, helpful, and attentive in just the right way!! I am definitely coming back, and better yet, my boyfriend now has a new restaurant to order lunch from for his staff!"}
{"text":"I'm super familiar with this area and I cannot believe it took me this long to discover this hidden gem! It's located just across the Nellis Air Force Base and is definitely a hole in the wall. Tiny parking lot, right next to an old/worn down auto body shop, kind of isolated, but don't let that scare you away.  We had the Tom yum soup with chicken, yellow curry with chicken, and chicken fried rice. The Tom yum soup was perfect and the chicken fried rice was flavorful that came in a large serving size. The yellow curry was the highlight of my meal. Oozing with flavor, chicken tender to perfection, and the flavor was so rich that my sister and I devoured this dish first. We wanted to try more items on the menu  so we will surely be back.  The inside is pretty small with a few tables & the aesthetic is super cute and welcoming. The best part though are the cheap, affordable prices. They also have lunch specials so make sure to check those out.  I'll absolutely be back here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Finally a decent asian restaurant close to Nellis AFB. If you drive by the area, you would never guess that this place exist. I love everything that we ordered  and the food was not pricey at all. They give military discounts as well so Im all about that lol. the service was excellent and will be my new go to spot  my ratings: 5/5 beef stew soup  5/5 papaya salad 5/5 chicken fried rice 5/5 calamari 5/5 thai tea yummmy"}
{"text":"Always amazing! Love this Thai Food some of the best on the North East side. I have had everything from the Pad Thai to the drunken noodle and from the Lemon grass BBQ Pork to the Penang Curry. It is all delicious and well priced. When we need a quick dinner on a weekday night or a Thai fix on a weekend then this is our place to go to. The staff is amazing and helpful and they do carry out or delivery through a third party."}
{"text":"Dry dry dry... Did I mention the food was drdy?  Never again so dispointed. My 6th old will eat anything and he would not even eat the rice. The cashier was snotty and just won't go again"}
{"text":"You know it is a good restaurant if you see 2 full bird colonel ordering and waiting happily for their food. This is the best restaurant within 1 mile radius from nellis afb in my opinion. It is next to the questionable apartment but like the other girl said, \"if you can go passed through the exterior, you'll like it.\" I think their food is reasonably priced.  Their lunch special has good portion to it for $5.99 and you'll get free Thai iced tea if you \"checked in\". My friends and I have been here 3 times already. I had green curry, spicy basil and yellow curry and they are all very delicious and taste authentic. Definitely give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"This is an average Thai food place in a poor location. I've been twice, once I ate in and once I ordered takeout. The food was prepared quickly and was not bad.  It also wasn't any better than the average local hole in the wall Thai food restaurant around Las Vegas.  That being said, I'd choose somewhere else based on its location.  It's located in a poor location.   *update*  Ordered for delivery.  The estimate was 40-50 minutes, but it's been 1.5 hours and still no food.  Reduced review down to one star.  My fault for trying again."}
{"text":"We stoped by this Thai restaurant because it was near by and we really didn't have much time to travel far.  As we pulled up, we were a little bit skeptical  it parking was a bit confusing... However, as we walked inside, we got a nice feeling, the place is well kept and clean, the bathrooms are also well maintained.  Finally, THE FOOD!!!! I haven't had pad Thai that I enjoyed, truly enjoyed in a very long time.. it's either too this or too that or not enough this or that.. but this pad Thai was  AWESOME!!  My husband had the shrimp/chicken fried rice and it was just mouth watering .  Our friend had the Thai beef salad and also was delicious!!    Thai teas were also delicious and a very nice portion for the price... and the boba  if I can say, the best I've EVER had, hands down .  Anyway definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the pad see eu and the spring rolls. Both were great. A little more spice would have made it perfect."}
{"text":"1st time here. Loved it!  Tofu Tom Kha soup is flavorful and delicious. Chinese broccoli with crispy pork also very good. I'm a small person so did not have room for dessert, will try it next time. Servers very attentive and did not disappoint. Packed up my leftover instead of just bringing out boxes and letting me do it myself like so many other asian restaurants.  When I walked in I was a bit weary of this place. It's small, casual looking and located in a not so fancy area.  But the food and service made me quickly decided I will be back again.   Tips. Check into yelp for free Thai Tea"}
{"text":"The lunch special is so filling. I got a beef Pad Thai. The beef was a little dry but it was still good. They also offer military discount. Staff was really friendly :)"}
{"text":"I'm super torn about this review.  Ridiculously torn.  We had seen Narong's was open a few weeks ago, but hadn't thought to stop in until Friday after work.  I was driving home, and my husband said \"Why don't you stop in and see how their prices are, and then we'll have dinner?\"  So I popped in.   The location is tiny tiny, but even being small, its very open, and very clean.    Service was top notch.  Very friendly and helpful when I asked questions.    The menu has a lot of variety, but wasn't overwhelming, and we ordered 2 entrees, 2 Thai teas with boba and a soup for $28.      The food was delicious.  We ordered:  Shrimp pad thai Masaman curry duck noodle soup  The pad thai was textbook delicious.  Perfect textures, shrimp was cooked well, and it was so flavorful.    the curry almost made me cry it was that good, especially compared to my last curry experience.  They made it to order, not super spicy, which made me happy.   The duck noodle soup was so rich and delicious.  I wasn't crazy about the texture of the skin, but the duck breast meat was SO good.    The Thai tea was great too:  fresh and perfect boba, sweet, rich tea...I'd stop in there just for a tea.    The problem I have is with the portion sizes.   Usually, other places that we've ordered from, 2 entrees will feed two of us a couple of meals.   The curry container was half full.  We only had a small scoop of rice for 2 people...we actually had to make more rice when I got the food home.  The pad thai had 6 shrimp, and where we normally can get 4 meals out of the pad thai from other places, we only had 1 serving each of this one.    So...as I said, I'm super torn on the number of stars to give this place. The quality and flavors were there, but its disheartening to pay the same amount as another spot and get half the food.    We will still come back, the quality was definitely better than we've had in a long time.  And to be honest, I'd rather pay for quality food...but seeing a half full container of curry was disheartening...maybe if they got smaller containers it wouldn't be so disappointing."}
{"text":"Recommend the Massaman curry and garlic rice!  Not to spicy and it taste amazing! Green tea and Thai tea is bomb!"}
{"text":"They were running behind probably cause it was closing time. I tjought I wasnt going to get my order but I got it. The delivery man was sweet and very polite. Food arrived hot and tasted fantastic. Definitely gonna order again."}
{"text":"I would say hands down the best Thai food in the area. They always have a smile whenever I come in. Quick service and quaint. Small and simple."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh, our server was nice and would check up on is us after every course . We had pad tai and duck curry and BBQ chicken alll of it had amazing flavor 10/10 recommend and will be going back !"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised to find Thai food on this side of town that is comparable to any of the restaurants in Chinatown!  The exterior is more than sketchy due to the location next to an abandoned car wash. The plus side is we had covered parking inside the car wash stall :). The interior is actually very clean and quaint, a stark contrast to the exterior. The menu is super affordable given the highest priced item is $9.95.  The lunch specials are super cheap and come with entree, egg roll, rice and soup if you dine in.   I opted for a chef's special, fried pork belly with fried rice.  This was heart burn worthy and delicious.  The pork belly was tender and crispy on the outside.  The Thai dipping sauce paired extremely well with the pork belly and the fried rice was flavorful. Limited seating and I hear the wait can be a little long for orders.  We called in our order to save some time. Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free Thai ice tea. Customer service was good as well, they refilled our water without us having to ask!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to order chicken and rice or kwao mun kai ,soup was tasteful and sauce was amazing"}
{"text":"You know what, I give this place 5 stars! Why? This has to be one of the best Thai restaurant this side of town offers. They are inexpensive, BUT consistently delicious! For the price you pay, you cant ask for more. Saves me and the family travel time for sure! It's literally a hole-in-the-wall joint next to a tattoo shop. But they're good. With all that in mind...yeah, 5 stars. Customer service isnt PHENOMENAL, folks, but it's consistently perfect! How are you? Refills? Do you need anything? Etc...all with a smile. Boom. I did, however, experience a phenomenal moment.   One day, their system wasnt processing correctly. Before we drove off, I checked our acct because I was worried as much swipes our card had been swiped in those minutes before realizing their system was an issue...I just had to be sure. That was a $45 trip, yall. There ended up being 2 pending charges on my acct. So I went back in. One of the owners said it shouldn't actual post. In the event it does, please contact them. I checked out acct a couple days later.to find, indeed, it posted twice. So we returned. I showed a screen shot of the charge and the same owner was soooo apologetic and so helpful. He gave me his phone number, his email, and assured me he will get it handled. Longer story shorter...he got it handled and I got my money back. He even sent me a screenshot on their end of their bank processing it. Never in my life have I experienced such prompt service such as that. I felt as if he was EAGER to give me my money back and valued me as a customer.   That alone sealed the deal and why we enjoy eating there. Supporting small.local businesses. Sure it isnt in the most aesthetically looking neighborhood, parking can be grim especially during lunch hour...but their food has never failed us. The interior is cutely decorated with obvious Ikea products, bathroom isnt filthy, and though it isnt verrrry spacious in there...it's \"spacious\" enough for the 6 of us... and honestly been here more times than I've actually checked-in.   If you are rolling deeper than 6...I suggest giving them a call to check what the seating situation is like. Also, free thai tea with yelp check-in? Spiffy!! Just make sure to show them your yelp check in offer as they tend to do all the clicking of redemption, etc...  Lunch specials are a steal. Note, if you take your lunch special to-go the soup does not come with it.   Speaking of space, it actually is pretty stroller friendly. Also, they do have high chairs! Highly recommend!!  Enjoy!  Advice: never review a business based on food you had delivered to you. There's a travel period, folks. The food will not be the same as it is when seated then served. Just saying."}
{"text":"I don't remember who introduced us to this nearly legitimate hole-in-the-wall (as it's adjacent to an.. autobody shop? a car wash? I don't even know...) but I need to find them and thank them profusely. This place is the best and most authentic Thai food in North Las Vegas or away from The Strip that I have found so far. We had Thai visitors with us and took them here, and if they called it authentic, I'll take their word for it.   Now on to the food. I'm going to skip past the Pad Thai, Fried Rice, and Thai Iced Tea, because 1) we all know it's delicious and 2) they do it just as delicious. Some of my personal favorites:   Fried Pork Belly & Rice: Simple dish, exactly as it sounds, with a few dipping options but honestly it's pretty damn good 'au naturel!' The pork belly is a really balanced mix of meat with the richness of the fat of that area, so don't think of bacon or pulled pork - this is unique in itself and SO good. It has a perfect combination of thick crunch, chew (both meaty and fatty), and the melty-in-your-mouth richness that animal fat does. Couple that with rice as your level base, and you've got a pretty darn good meal right there.  Mango Sticky Rice: Anyone that hasn't tried this yet needs to go find some, NOW. This is a uniquely Asian dish (to my knowledge), using short grain rice, soaked overnight (the actual process escapes me), steamed, sweetened with coconut milk or something.. and then you add ripe mango with that and sweet milk (condensed milk? coconut milk? sorry guys, culinary fail today) but regardless, the tangy sweetness of the fruit with the bulk and chew and more subtle and level sweetness of the rice - it's really divine. Oh, and the rice really is quite sticky; don't try to cut through this with cheap plastic cutlery - it's not going to work.  Give these guys a try. The staff, food, and service are authentic to Thai values, and I'm just beyond glad they are within such a close proximity to work."}
{"text":"The banana ice cream was good but the pad Thai tasted different then any other pad Thai I've ever had and wasn't the best. Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for dinner with a friend. The place wasn't crowded at all. You could tell they are use to carry out mostly on weeknights. The parking lot was full (it is VERY small) so we had to park across the street. The service was decent for a small hole in the wall place. The guy running the front brought our drinks and took our orders pretty quickly. Since I have a love for Pad Thai I decided to order the chicken pad Thai from the menu. It was good, not spectacular, but good. It did feel a little bland at parts in the dish especially since I had to mix in the bean sprouts and peanuts myself, but maybe that is because a lot of people don't actually like those. The main reason for my 4 Stars was the dryness of the chicken in the dish, I wish it had more sauce to take the dry edge off. Other than the place definitely feeling hole in the wall out of date it was good. I may be back if I am in the area again. Especially given the reasonable price. My Pad Thai dish was under $10. Can't beat that for a dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try on a whim and it was a very pleasant surprise!  At first glance it is tiny and kind of a sketchy exterior but once you get inside its a very clean, cute, petite restaurant.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgable of the menu. If you check in you get a free thai tea which was one of the best thai teas I've ever had. The pad see eu and pad thai were delivered to the table in record time! They were both very flavorful and decent size for the price.   Get past the exterior and you'll be treated to this great hidden gem! And don't miss out on that thai tea check in!"}
{"text":"We found this hidden gen a month ago and we cant get enough.  Friendly, CLEAN and most important authentic Thai food.  The service is quick and perfectly located outside of base housing.  My fav is the Chicken Pad Thai and the pot stickers!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner at this place! I got the pot stickers and khua kai, both of which were delicately flavored and delicious. Service was good too. There are not many parking spots, but would be fine off peak hours or for takeout. Overall, great place and hope they do well!"}
{"text":"I had never had Thai food before until I ate here. It is delicious! I have eaten here many times now and tried many dishes and my favorite is the yellow curry. It is full of flavor and you can pick if you want spicy or not. They are quick and friendly and the price is not bad either!.."}
{"text":"So happy to know there was a Thai restaurant close by us    Walked in and ordered the lady was super nice and just a great with all the questions I had regarding the menu, delivery, and lunch specials. Got our food got home and wow so freaking good we got the kimchi fried rice and yellow curry I'm so coming back"}
{"text":"Food was so good I kept going back while I was in town. Really enjoyed the service too."}
