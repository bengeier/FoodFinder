{"text":"This is now one of my favorite car washes to go to, today Nick & Kris were the gentleman to help me out & cleaned/ hand dried off my car. They were both super super sweet & were very detailed on the work. Will defiantly come back soon & recommend this place ! Plus the prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"Place is immaculate. I walked in and thought, what a nice gas station. Is was shiny and new. Car wash is also great, especially those workers who are doing the job. Very friendly guys. And their vacuums are the best ever. Not only are they free, but they have the best suction that I have witnessed. Thanks Haddies, i will be back again.  Jessie-Uber/Lyft driver"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service (like scary good). Brenda and the crew rocked! I've never had any experience like this at a mini food mart, not to mention at most restaurants. The mart is clean, modern, and beautiful. Come here if you want to feel like a princess. Seriously."}
{"text":"Brenda took care of me after my small incident, I appreciate them reaching out and attending to my issue. Nick took care of my car yesterday and really cared for it and took their time. Would definitely come back now. Even after everything."}
{"text":"Tried out this car wash for the first time and had a good experience. Efficient and effective, went mid-morning, no line. They had two attendants high power wash and scrub my car before entering the automated portion. Afterwards, there were another two attendants to towel-dry the car. Car washes range from $8-16, price already includes tax. I hope the service and quality stay consistent so that I can make this my regular car wash."}
{"text":"I love their car wash.  They power wash debris off your car really well prior to entering car wash.  My car always comes out super clean.  $16 for the top tier wash.  Best quality drive thru car wash in town! They towel dry your car and you can use their high powered vacuum lot."}
{"text":"It's a gas station, how hard could it be?  This location is staffed with amazing employees who truly set it apart! I frequent here for gas, water, cigs, and today.. a car wash. I was hesitant to buy the $13 wash because come.. it's a gas station wash ? but my car was thoroughly scrubbed down prior and nick ensured that my car was dried spotless (I could hear him coaching the younger employee) and that showed me that he truly cared about the outcome of my vehicle! They also have the worlds best vacuums that I actually struggled to pull out of the holder because their suction is so strong! And they even have floor mat holders so you don't have to vacuum them off on the ground! It's the little things. I'll definitely be using this wash over the ARCO car wash from now on!"}
{"text":"Great car wash. Attendants are very attentive. This one is behind/attached to the new Chevron. They prep wash and hand dry, did a thorough job."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest and cleanest gas stations that I have been to. I've only tried the deli sandwiches but I need to try the breakfast one day. Car wash attendants are onsite to help scrub the heavy dirt off before it goes into the car wash and more attendants are at the end to dry your car. If I'm not in a rush, I use their free vacuums.   Congrats! You've got a customer for life."}
