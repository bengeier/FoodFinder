{"text":"Great to finally have a clean restaurant that serves tasty rotis in the Meadowvale area. Love it!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. I just got the roti with no filling as I make my own at home ( can't make roti though, it's an art I have yet to master).  The paratha was great! The dhalpori was ok ( when compared to my grandmas... She's the best at it). I'm sure that by would have been fine with a filling, but I'm a dipper. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place! It's a must try and very clean. I highly recommend the veggie platter and almost everything on their menu. Don't forget to ask for \"no pepper\" if your a softy like myself lol or you will be in for a shock. Doubles are pretty good too and always fresh! Enjoy."}
{"text":"#1 roti in the GTA, and I don't say that lightly. The curries are absolutely perfect in flavour in consistency, with a wide variety of meat and veggie options. The service is very friendly and warm, and there is a large eat in dining area, which is rare for a roti spot. Finally, you have to try the chicken doubles. I have never tasted anything like them and they are out of this world."}
{"text":"First time trying Caribbean food and I love it! The duck curry so very good- flavorful, soft  and juicy meats. The nice lady in front suggested the Dhalpuri so I got it- sooo good!!! Nice flaky bread with layers of thin roti and granules of yellow lentil.   The only thing that irks me is the styrofoam plate and plastics fork/knife!   I hope they continue to do well and can afford real plates and utensils."}
{"text":"I've had their doubles. I'm not a fan of doubles, but theirs is delicious. I drive from Milton for them, very delicious. I eat them Spicy."}
{"text":"Goat roti is amazing! Go for the boneless for the extra couple dollars. Saheena doesn't come with channa if you don't specify. Also, great shops in the area for Indian outfits. :)"}
{"text":"Can I give this place more stars? This place is amazing. First, when we walked in we liked how it looked. Clean, modern design, looks really nice but not too formal to make us feel underdressed in our casual clothes. Next we asked the lady a few questions about the menu, since we aren't familiar with some of the items. Clearly she loves what she does, since she happily explained the items and got excited when I told her some of the things that sounded great. I ended up trying a double (new to me) and wow, I loved it! I went with the veggie meal where I got a roti and four items to choose. They were all great but I particularly loved the eggplant dish. It's smoky and delicious. Great selection of cool drinks also, I tried the Peardrax and really like it. The service was very fast, the food was excellent, the prices are totally reasonable, what more can you ask?"}
{"text":"This owner and employees at this location always have a nice smile and welcome you with open arms to their resturant.  The food is really good expecially the doubles.  The wait time is very short but be prepared to join a crowd cause there are a lot of people in there."}
{"text":"Frequent this place because it is close to work and something different.  Doubles are good but when you think you can handle heat and you say yes to spicy....  Good luck :). I ask for mild now and everything is delicious.  I've had the chicken and goat roti's and they are good and huge.  I also enjoy them with that banana drink.  This continues to be a fav."}
{"text":"I think the food here is very average  however  I was not disappointed  in quality or taste of food. It has a very clean and nice atmosphere  but not with the drive . Try if you are in this hood tho why not :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Barb's, Bara's, Leela's, Kori's and Ranee's and this is the best of the bunch for me.  I always order the goat roti, spicy, and I have yet to find a better one.  The people I go with order other things, and they've never had any complaints.  It can get busy around lunch time on a week day, and parking in the plaza can be hard to find.  If you're going for lunch, try to go either earlier or later than the lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"I've been by for lunch a couple of times while working in Mississauga. I tried the boneless goat roti the first time and it is quite good. The roti itself is nice and flakey and up there with the best in the GTA. The goat curry was tasty but the goat really could have stood being cooked for a while longer. Not as tender as other places. I tried the doubles on a subsequent visit and again very tasty. It's a larger serving than other places so be warned. Service is reasonably quick and the staff pretty friendly. This is an order then go to your seat kinda place. I would recommend and will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"I get their mild doubles. Its 2 fried breads/pitas with chickpeas in it. So yummy and very affordable.   The cashier has always been friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Got the chicken roti and the taste was just awesome. The wait was long.  And the cashier was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Stick to the veggie items, they're not that great at prepping tender chicken but they have good sauces/ chutneys in their doubles and aloo pies. My favourite at Lena's is the Aloo pie. Their price is pretty decent, just wish their chicken was more flavourful inside rather than just marinated in sauce on the exterior."}
{"text":"I went here to grab some food w my mom for fathers day. Had heard about them from yelp so thought I would check it out myself.  The owner, Lena is very friendly.  She was at the till and hearing I'd been there for the first she offered some doubles (I blurted out \" like at tim's - clearly not a coffee but a little of cultural ignorance on my part).  The double is 2 Small flatbreads with curried chickpeas in between.  Not too bad but oily and carby :) which of course makes it tasty.  We got the chicken and goat ( there are bone in options- i opted for boneless) roti, one spicy and one medium.  The spicy is....OHMYGOD spicy but holds enough back that you can taste the food.  The medium is actually just right if you like spicy.  The restaurant itself needs to be redone.  It isn't designed for glamour but is clean.  Has a lot of ads for local items or events that gives it a cheap look, and hand written signs are on the walls outlining rates or sales.  However, the warmth and support of the customers overshadows the physical attributes of the site.  We had customers talking to us about the history and food.  Living in Toronto I never get a small town feel in any place except this one.  People were not customers, they were family."}
{"text":"I was out shopping for an outfit for my wedding. After a long morning we needed something delicious. We ended up stopping in for a quick bite at Lena's Roti and I must say, we where not disappointed. The service from Kish was nothing but a pleasure but also the food, I cannot say enough about it. We ended up ordering Dhal roti and channa/aloo with hot sauce (hot as hell). It was so good, we ended up ordering more rotis with the squash combination. The squash is actually made fresh with all ingredients from Trinidad. I have had many Jamaica rotis in my time but nothing compares to Lena's Roti. It's very rare to find phenomenal service, amazing food at a reasonable price and all made fresh. We have an upcoming event and will be having it all catered from Kish himself. Solid restaurant and we hope to see another location in Burlington :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for doubles in the GTA. The doubles are fresh, tasty and taste so authentic you will think you are back in Trinidad."}
{"text":"Best doubles I ever had outside of Trinidad. Everything from the consistency of the barra and the mango tasted authentic. I would have thought I was in trini If it wasn't for the snow outside. They have all the trini sodas and snacks. Amy was very polite and service was fast. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Fresh and reminds me of my trip to Trinidad. The doubles are my fav and my son loves the chicken curry.  Be sure to try one of their drinks as there are many to choose from.  Good job Lena and crew!"}
{"text":"Excellent rotis here at Lena's! I had the pumpkin curry and it was delicious! I asked for the spicy version and it had a good heat on it. Totally worth the trip out there."}
{"text":"Good saltfish and bake. Very friendly staff, and clean. Doubles wasn't anything too special. The bake was perfect though."}
{"text":"Well I love Trini food, and heard that Lena's has opened in my neighbourhood.  I dropped in one dday for lunch and enjoyed it.  The line was almost out the door.  I ended up ordering the boneless goat roti and three doubles (two for my wife when she got home).  The Roti was good, not great.  It was a little dry for my taste, and could have been great if it was moister.  Still the roti bread and the double were great.  I will repeat.  Since I live in the area, I wish that this place were open on weekends.  Hopefully someday they will."}
{"text":"There are too many times I was asking for non spicy but end up with getting spicy...... The taste is OK? but dishes are very similar to each other. While the food is still in general better than most of the other restaurants in that plaza..."}
{"text":"Love yelping new places when I need something in a pinch. This ap has yet to disappoint.  Food was good fresh and quick."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The kids works the counter needs to be educated and show some care for customers. However the food trump the service."}
{"text":"Terrific. Had a chicken roti. Decided to check this place out based on the high star rating from fellow yelpers and was in agreement that this place is worth the stop off the 401!"}
{"text":"ordered the Boneless Chicken Roti as mild, with the hot sauce on the side. The meat was very soft and the curry was just perfect.  wish they had bit more though.  For the cost of $10.50 (incl tax) wanted more (guess am a bit greedY) THE HOT SAUCE WILL Make A BROWN GUY SWEAT BUCKETS!! teases very nice though!  The guy who was serving was very helpful.  i knew what i was getting but there were folks that were very new to the cuisine.  He asked all the right questions and suggested the product they would like.  Sure enough, they loved it!!!   Good Service and Good Food!  this is a small business ambience, so dont be expecting great chairs and tables.  It has a place to sit and eat, thats it."}
{"text":"Just as the title, nice little place to grab a humongous, yet delectable roti, wrapped or separate. The doubles are equally good. You can opt for a \"spice level\" for most everything on the menu, from none to hot, and can choose from a myriad options, like lamb (boned or boneless), duck, chicken, etc.  The service was so fast, by the time we ordered, sat, and opened a pop, it was there. No waiting for the food, and there's no stopping your mouth once it's in front of you. So good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a veggie roti with chickpeas and potato for take out.  My order was taken by a lady who I assume had was Lena - very friendly and lovely to chat with.  The roti was the prefect thickness and texture, thin and light. Curry inside was spiced nicely with delicious flavour and heat.  Will return again soon to try some of their veggie dishes."}
{"text":"There skins are far too thick and every time you go there roti filling gets less and less very disappointed won't go back"}
{"text":"The food wasn't horrible but I wasn't impressed either  I visited on a Friday around lunch time the dining room was full and there was a little bit of a line but the cashier was quick so I didn't wait long to place my order  It took less than 5 minutes for my doubles to come out after I ordered them for me I like my doubles a little bit on the runny side and the Curry wasn't that runny I didn't like the dough it lacked flavor to me overall if someone were to give it to me I'd eat it but I don't think I would go back and spend my own money on it"}
{"text":"The food was fast and delicious. I had the boneless goat and it was hot and sizzling. Lots of parking spaces and lunchtime isn't too busy. The ordering steps are easy and there are nice people there."}
{"text":"Now this is good food. This was a skip the dishes order and the food was delivered hot. I ordered the basic staples such as doubles, Aloo pie, pholourie and a boneless goat roti. I also ordered two solo drinks, currants roll and Kurma to try. The pictures speak for themselves when showing you quality food. There's no filler... like a ridiculous amount of potato for the curry goat, what you get is honest and delicious food. They didn't forget a single item from our order, they sent us napkins and cutlery. This location is definitely raising the bar for quality food delivered right to your door from skip the dishes. Do not hesitate to try their boneless goat roti because the flavors were outstanding. This is my go-to when I'm craving home cooked, flavorful food from the islands. My boyfriend enjoyed every single dish and complimented the amount of goat we received in the Roti as he's had other experiences and they were never this good. I had no problem ordering from their menu options on the app, because they put no pepper as an option... Other restaurants of this nature should follow suit. I will certainly be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I came here because I was in the area.  I was starving.  I ordered a roti and a doubles.  It was too much.  Both were delicious but I definitely had some serious food coma in the afternoon.  Worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Visited this place with my Office colleagues, we had Dalpuri with Aloo Chana and Tomatoes Choka, Fried Fish sandwich, Doubles, Wraps.. the food was overall was tasty with huge portions. The Dine in experience is also good as the place has spacious sitting area and is very neat. I would recommended this place if you are looking around for some good West Indian food for a small group (4-5 people) of family or friends."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come to Toronto, I have to stop by and get a great plate of yumminess."}
{"text":"Food was good, price was decent. I had the Curried Boneless Goat for $7 and it was pretty large (I didn't quite finish it) but just a teeny bit lacking on the meat."}
{"text":"Unfortunately quality West Indian food is not part of the standard here. Service is also terrible. Food is over priced for the quantity and quality. Apart from that it is decent in esthetics.  This place would not be at the top of my recommendation list."}
{"text":"Alright I should start off by saying I went to this place by accident, but I was happy that the food here was amazing. I got the boneless chicken roti with a doubles. The boneless chicken had the right mix of sauce. I find that determines a good roti, if the insides are too runny then it gets too messy and its hard to eat and if the insides are too dry then the whole meal is off because you have to drink more.   Now for the doubles, I was excepting more favour but it really wasn't that good. I would say stick to Roti's here."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious trini food, one of the best in Toronto. Love their doubles, goat in dhalpuri, and veggie platter with the jackfruit, mango, callaloo, chick peas, and okra with bus up shut to dip. They even give you a small container or chutney which Leela's doesn't even provide! They also have tamarind and hot sauce too. All of it was delicious plus their cassava or pone was so fresh better than Leela's too."}
{"text":"$5.99 lunch special for a chicken/duck/goat/etc roti + a free double? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I'm eating but this place was extremely good for a value and very filling and tasty (but definitely not healthy) lunch. Everything was hot and made fresh to order. Watch out for spicy, it's really spicy!  My only qualm is that the roti with duck came with a lot of bones. I'm aware that ducks have bones, but it's hard to eat with the bones inside the roti.  Lots of seating room available and usually ample parking space in the plaza. Order, grab a seat and show your number when they come to your table."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! So flavorful!  The Channa and Aloo roti is absolutly fantastic, and can only be made better by placing a double on top of it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to grab some roti & doubles here ever since I started working in Mississauga and finally got the chance last week and Lena's did not disappoint.  Came in at around 730p for take-out and the place was really quiet, which is to my benefit I suppose since it seems to be usually busy according to other reviewers. Ordered myself a goat roti dhalpuri ($9.99) and a doubles ($1.90? If I remember correctly...) and it took about 5-10min tops for the wait. I'll probably call ahead next time to see if I can place an order to avoid waiting during my break as they close at 8pm.  When I finally got my food my bag felt surprisingly heavy. At first I thought I might've heard my order wrong as there was another gentleman waiting for his food as well, but I was assured I had the correct order. Once back at the office and I opened the contents of my to-go bag, the roti was MASSIVE - easily 2-3lbs! The doubles were also a good size, and if I had ordered 3-4 I could've easily been filled on those alone. But the Roti... my goodness. Large chunks of goat and so full of flavour! The curry was also delish and I had to take multiple breaks while eating it since it was so large!   I highly suggest having a big appetite when having one of Lena's roti's!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Lena's one day after deciding to switch up my lunch routine. I was greeted warmly by the staff who made recommendations on what to get. I went with their recommendation and ordered a meat roti.  The roti was huge and delicious!   My only gripe about this place is that the roti is so big it may as well be 2 meals. I'd rather they cut the price (down from ~$14/roti) and size down."}
{"text":"I was passing by at noon on Saturday and noticed Lena's is now open on weekends! I was having a BBQ at home with a few people later that day but have been wanting to try their dhalpuri for a while now. I decided this was a good opportunity to pop in and grab some take-out for my guests to sample.  When I walked in, the place was empty (likely because people don't know that it is now open weekends) but I was welcomed by a very friendly and knowledgable woman who helped guide me on what to order. I decided on a sampling of 2 rotis (I chose dhalpuri style rather than the plain paratha style). I decided on one channa roti which is filled with chickpeas and potato ($7.99) and one boneless chicken ($9.99) and a side order of 2 \"doubles\" ($1.90 each) per her recommendation which are also filled with chickpeas (they do have chicken doubles if you prefer over chick peas for an additional cost).  The food came out very quickly (I sat at one of their many tables in the restaurant while I waited). The food was nice and hot and brought out by another very friendly woman at the back. The rotis were huge! And the doubles were so delicious (filled with chick peas but they also have chicken if you prefer meat). The doubles were well worth it for less than $2 each. I could have one of them as a meal and be satisfied!   I personally preferred the chick peas but my brother enjoyed the chicken better. I found the chicken a little dry but I am not a big meat eater so that could be just my viewpoint. I absolutely enjoyed both the doubles and the channa dhalpuri so would highly recommend. They also have really great other selections like goat, lamb and pumpkin!  Check it out if you are in the area. You can sit in or take out. It looks like they also may have lunch specials during the week."}
{"text":"Great roti and quick / friendly service. Got chicken + rice. Medium spicy was a bit too spicy for me - next time will definitely get mild. But amazing taste."}
{"text":"My fist shot at this cuisine. Just Amazing. vegan Doubles are the best with Hot sauce."}
{"text":"I work near this location, so its a quick and easy stop to get delicious food. This location is large, clean and modern. Service is very quick and those working the counter are efficient and welcoming. You sometimes get free additions if you buy certain amounts. Example, I ordered 15 doubles for take out and got 3 free. Not sure if that deal is all the time, but was a nice surprise. Doubles, goat roti and pholouries are absolute deliciousness. You must try them!"}
{"text":"\"People usually get plain roti because it's less messy.\"  Give me the other one then.   Lena's is messy delicious business. You have two options for roti, paratha or dhal puri, and an assortment of different meats to choose from (ex. Chicken, goat, duck). Of course, there are a number of items on the menu as well worth exploring.   I had the goat roti and doubles, which came out rather quickly. I started with a fork and knife and gradually progressed to eating with my hands - a necessary change. The food is amazing! I found the meat portions very generous, and the meal was filling and super flavourful.   Will definitely come back again to try more things in the menu.   Note: this seems to be the same restaurant as the one in Brampton so enjoy whether you're there or in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Very tasty doubles, and cheap!!!! Also very good tomato choka and rotis:) Authentic Trinidad Cuisine!"}
{"text":"9.99 for boneless goat roti. u have 2 options for the roti. i'm not even going to try to name them cus i will fail. but there was a plain roti and one with some sort of crushed bean/peas type stuff. i went with the plain one because i find the other one a bit dry(though i've never had it here before). the roti is quite big in size and was truly boneless. i hate biting into goat roti and almost breaking my face biting into a chunk of bone. goat was nice and juicy. the downside is that it's very very messy to eat. but you all know how much i love messy foods. will try their doubles next and they also have chicken doubles which i've never had or seen before."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Aloo pie and doubles are extremely yummy and very very cheap fast food. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This roti shop is high quality, the staff are friendly and the food tastes amazing. The prices are average, but they have a wide variety of foods. They cook vegetarian food separately to ensure that it is not contaminated by any meats. This is the new Lena's Roti & Doubles, there is an older one which I do not recommend as the food there is very poor quality. Any long time Lena's fan should be aware of this change. Lena's is our go-to restaurant for West Indian food. I would recommend, and will come again to Lena's Roti & Doubles. (BTW: To tell apart the two shops, the good one has large green text on the building itself while the bad one has green text on a black background)."}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend this place! First time ever having doubles and I loved it. I tried their Chicken Doubles and goat roti, thought both of them had great amount of flavor and heat. if anything the chicken doubles was a little lacking in chicken but still tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"I swear, the Caribbean girl in me cries out when I eat doubles... I love everything about doubles, the doughy texture, the spicy chickpeas inside, that spicy sauce that you pour all over it... it's so satisfying and one is never enough.   During one of the many event for a Hindu wedding, we order 50 doubles to munch on (since theses events have to be vegetarian meals) and doubles were such a crowd pleaser. Everyone loved how flavorful they were. Package nicely and the sauces that came with them were oh so delicious. These folks were super fast and these doubles were prepared well.  Try them out if you are in the neighborhood... you won't regret it"}
