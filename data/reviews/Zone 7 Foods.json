{"text":"Stopped in to grab some lunch after reading a write up up about this spot on a local website. Everything these folks use is locally sourced, which I absolutely love.   I gathered that their main thing was creating prepared meals, which they individually package, freeze and sell in their store as well as a market in the noda area. They had 3 or 4 choices for meals on hand. They also have several varieties of pizza for sale, all locally sourced too.  They had 3 choices of soup for lunch today; beef n bean chili, broccoli soup or veggie soup, all served with their ricotta cheese roll. Price was $6 for a med bowl or $8 for the larger size.   I left with the veggie soup and the broccoli soup. Both my wife and I loved each of the offerings. Delicious! As far as the ricotta cheese roll, i don't possess the ability to describe how good this thing is!  Good people and delicious food. I would give an all around great experience and highly recommend that you should give this joint a try."}
{"text":"Stopped into this unassuming little spot for their soup & ricotta roll lunch deal. Offered Thursday and Friday only. $6 for an 8oz. bowl/$8 for a 12 oz. bowl. Both served with bread. Zone 7 is off of Monroe Road (near the Wendover intersection and Gus' Sir Beef) and can be hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. It's part of an odd little strip mall, between the Oakhurst Grille and some cheapo cell phone store.   They had 3 soup choices when I stopped in. I chose the mushroom and beer soup. Because... beer! My friend had the potato sunchoke. Both were amazing -- perfect on a cold, January day. The ricotta roll was simply out of this world. Soft and perfectly salty with this rich, creamy ricotta in the center. Mmmmm! I could have eaten at least 10 of them.   The spot is carry out only. The people behind the counter are super friendly and informative about their selection and where all the ingredients come from. We were in, out and back to the office with a piping hot bowl of soup in under 20 minutes. I have a sneaking suspicion this is going to quickly become our favorite go-to lunch spot. I'll be back over and over again for sure!"}
{"text":"Go here.   I've only just tried their lunch today and their cream of mushroom soup is amazing. I found myself eating the ricotta roll super slow because of how sad I was going to be when it was gone. Since it's so close to my home I will probably be frequenting their Friday lunches!   The people inside are super nice and I can't wait to try some of their frozen pizzas!"}
