{"text":"Tasty sandwich. Friendly service. I'll know more after I try their empanadas... Next time..."}
{"text":"The gals that run this restaurant are an enterprising lot!  Their empanadas are very good,  Fast service.

Decor of the place is such, that you really do not want to dine there.  Take-out is better.  Perhaps it is OK for the neighbourhood lunch crowd.  Nevermind, I'll do their take-out!"}
{"text":"Crispy delicious empanadas anyone? Was amazed at how good these were. Ask for extra salsa when you order. Trust me I could drink the stuff. Fresh fresh fresh"}
{"text":"Food plus the service = 5 stars
I'm so glad I read the reviews for this place on Yelp and tried it. My favorite was the beef empanada and the cocktail cheese empanada. Yes , I've had better ones in other cities but what sold me was the friendly owner who knew how to serve his customers!"}
{"text":"Now open in their new location and better than ever. We tried the spicy chicken empanadas which were just coming out of the oven: Fantastic! The pastry light and flaky and golden and the filling beautifully seasoned with a nice bit of heat. This is going to become a habit!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 6 empanadas  with a mix between baked and fried. I also ordered a sliced beef baked  and a fried cheese and shrimp to eat in. Both were delicious plus nice and hot inside and when topped with some of their homemade salsa the flavor was even better.

The take out order took a while to get but i just ate my meal while I waited.

There is a nice selection of exotic sodas for purchase, i will probably try a tamarind soda next time.

I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident when I was looking for a Mexican restaurant that was listed as being next door. (It had moved). Being hungry and not wanting to bother finding the new location, I walked into Empanada Queen about 15 minutes before closing on a Sunday. The staff apologized and explained that they weren't cooking any actual meals as they were getting ready to close and the cook/owner had already left for the day, however, I was definitely welcome to buy some Empanada's. 
I explained that I had never had them before so they totally explained how they were made, what was in them, different flavours, etc.
I bought 6 empenada's and headed home. We heated them in the oven as advised and man, were they ever good!!! Beef, chicken, cheese, sooooo good.
The next time we went back, a few days later, the owner/cook was there and she was very friendly and explained the different items on the menu, how she prepares them, etc. We ordered some spicy beef and chicken empanada's, and a couple of the main dishes and it was WAY too much food for me and my wife, but man it was so awesome!
Don't forget to order extra of the homemade salsa, it's really, really good!

If you're looking for something different, give Empanada Queen a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed. You're better off ordering your food and taking it home as it's a very tiny little place with only a couple of tables."}
{"text":"I love empanadas (tried the real deal in Valpara√≠so) and was super-excited to find a nice groupon for this small Chilean bakery. 

Went to their Manilla Road location over the weekend for a 1/2 dozen chicken & beef empanadas.  The filling is authentic, Chilean 'pino': savory ground beef, egg, olive, onion & raisin.  The pastry is so crispy & delicious, especially when deep fried. Spicy is my favorite.. 

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We have tried 4-5 different flavours of their empanadas. They were so plain we couldn't tell the difference. And unfortunately their service was awful too, ignoring and disrespectful (even though there was no-one else inside the small diner), she couldn't take her time to answer our questions properly. We will stay away from this place and don't recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"I was hoping this would work well as a take out order on my way to the mountains and it sure was! I even walked away with some recommendations for where I should go next. They also have a great deal from groupon to get a good deal on a half dozen of their empanadas. 

5 stars - Spinach empanada. Spinach, feta cheese, onions and olives. Baked. The best part was the olives. They were the Greek style olives and really pumped up the flavor. 

5 stars- Cheese empanada. Mozzarella cheese. Fried. Eat this one hot for a cheese explosion, in the best kind of way! Every mouthful was full of cheese. The empanada was spilling over with cheese after I took a bite. Wow!! I can see why this is one of their most popular items. The fry on it does not make it greasy at all. How do they do that with such a soft dough?

4 stars - Black Bean chipotle and vegetable empanada. Black beans, chipotle, onions, mushrooms, spinach, olives and green peppers. Baked. This had a nice spice to it. I liked that they offered this vegetarian option. 

A side of salsa comes with your empanada order and it is the best match. It adds a freshness to the baked goods. Make a stop here. Great service and great food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A former pizza place turned into a destination for homestyle traditional Chilean food! Their empanadas are just like back home. Their sandwiches are epic! Try the Chacarero (steak, avocado, tomatoes on a toasted home made bun, get some pebre on the side) and it's just like having one at a sidewalk cafe in Santiago, but right here in NE Calgary. Make the trip and go check it out. You'll go from \"What is Chilean food?\" to \"I love Chilean food!\""}
{"text":"Finally got to try these beautiful Empanadas at the Inglewood Sunfest! So fresh, fried, crunchy, hot, juicy and delicious! We love supporting the small businesses in the area and they deserve a stop-in!
My fave was the chicken followed by the cheese (surprisingly mozzarella)(hubby's fave) and then the beef. The homemade salsa (ultra mild to suit all tastes) was really, really good and I could have eaten a lot of it. 
A delightful twist on lunch away from the ordinariness of say, a sandwich.
They are moving their business - they are not sure where they are going but we will find them!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches, empanadas and traditional Chilean dishes at a reasonable price. I recommend Pastel de choclo (meat pie), empanada de queso (cheese turnover) and pino (beef turnover). You can eat here or take the food home, either way it is authentic and delucios food."}
{"text":"I usually don't post reviews but this Place has Delicious food!!! Best Latin food I've had in Calgary and beats any food truck I've tried. The Brazilian lady working there did a great job and she was very attentive. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place after I experience my first Chillean Emapanda at the Crossroads Farmer's Market.  They told me about Empanda Queen in the Marlborough area and since I'm from the NE, I decided to check em out.

Pizza Roma is gone and now it is full fledge Chilean Deli.  There are 2 tables you can sit at and enjoy your empanadas, but from the time I was there, a lot of traffic was pick up.  The great thing is that they always advise to call before you pick up b/c they actually make the deep fried ones to order.   It takes 5 mins to cook but if you are going to order a dozen or more.  It will take longer. That was OK b/c it's worth the wait.

This review is just on empanadas as those were the only things I tried!  
I shared  a Ground Beef Empanada with my sister and she got lucky and had the egg and I got the olive :(  I don't like olives lol.  These can be baked or fried. I had the baked ones which are made daily and is just heat and serve in their oven.  Not microwaved.  That was awesome!
Filling was:  Ground beef, onions, a slice of egg, olive and raisin.

The whole reason I went there was for: Cheese Empanadas and Cheese and Shrimp Empanadas.  Ohhhhhhhh so yummy.   It's like mozza sticks but way better as it is enclosed in a crispy fried patry. Now, because of gravity and melted cheese, it does tend to sink to bottom but that just gives it enough room for you to add Pebre!!!!

Don't forget the Pebre!! A must -  Chilean Salsa - some are spicy, some are not but this is what I think is in Pebre.... onions, cilantro, tomatoes, garlic, and other herbs n spices.

All in all I went home with a dozen cheese ($16)  and a dozen cheese and shrimp ($18)

I've already eaten 5 :)

{"text":"A hole in the wall bakery that requires quite a bit of maneuvering around the Marlborough mall area to find, Empanada Queen is definitely a place I'm going to visit several times.

Their Chilean style empinadas were delicious and were great for taking to work for lunch. I tried their basic beef and chicken stuffing, but they also offered several other flavours. It's a very different style of empinadas compared to the Filipino style that I'm accustomed to, they were larger with a more thinner and crispier bread. The fillings were also spiced differently and were just the right amount so that every bite ensures meaty juicy goodness but nothing overflows and the empanada explodes in your hands like a bad joke gone wrong.

The only drawback was that when I came, they only had a few flavours available and required a pre-order for the items that weren't available. But they do have a nifty website. Sweet! They're also selling tickets to Don Omar!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place several hundred times and always wanted to try the Empanadas.

The dough on the Empanadas was nicely folded and the chicken and beef filllng plentiful and satisfying, but it was the magical fresh made salsa I wanted more of!

With a fainty Cilantro undertone, the fresh salsa was the perfect compliment to the hearty Empanada.    

There was a sign that intrigued me as I waited.   It was about a basement suite for rent.  I got the no pets and  access to a  certain appliances but no separate kitchen but the Fumadore had me puzzled.  A young customer who was obviously a regular informed me after placing her order and getting ready to read while she waited for her order Fumadore meant smoking!

I'm thinking that the spicy beef  Empanada we brought home for our daughter might just be Fumadore!  

Unforutnatley by the time we arrived only chicken and two beef empanadas were left.  
I want to try more next time.  And I definitely meant to try the delicious looking Million Layer Cake I want to try next time.   Even if it is $7.50  per carton, that huge wedge could feed 3 to 4 people easily.  

I will call ahead next time because at 6 for $20.00  Empanada Queen offers a great deal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with these excellent empanadas. We tried a selection of both baked and deep-fried. Spicy chicken baked and the small cheese deep-fried selections were the two best. Don't forget the salsa. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"she forgot my tamales.  I think the empanadas in the case are very old, try to order new ones made for you.  I was expecting more higher class shredded meats for the prices, not just ground who knows when meats that look like le up, ze chuck in a pocket.  Taste the same going down as they do coming back up.

Seeing the reply has kicked a sleeping dog or woken a sleeping baby, so i have to lower my score on revisiting the experience.  There was an ANT in one of the boxes.  So she has ants in her kitchen, red ants that pinch, I suggest a thorough cleaning of the kitchen and a review of practices of the chef.  On coming back after sitting in rush hour traffic because she forgot my tamales, she didnt even throw in a few extra tamales for my troubles.  

The 'spicy' is just sriracha sauce she puts into the empanada, I was expecting fresh chili paste hand made by the chef.  The cheese empanadas once cooled are practically devoid of any cheese, they are hollowed out caverns with a slight cheese coating.

Im allergic to eggs and there was whole eggs, hardboiled and sliced,  in the empanadas in the case (barely a fridge) that seemed to be from the weekend, not freshly made that day.   

I will never be going back or recommend their services to others."}
{"text":"This place is quite difficult to find (we actually went to the mall food court due to lack of understanding)  in reality you take the road just north of the mall and it's in a tiny strip mall on the left across from the community center (I think - it looks like one). 

Once we found parking we noticed a delicious smell once we got out of the car and luckily it was delicious empanadas being baked.  We were greeted by the owner who was very pleasant, helpful and educational (a lovely combo when going into an ethic joint for the first time when you have little experience)

We picked up several kinds of empanadas - I had spinach and cheese.   My favorite is the cheese (but they are deep fried and the spinach is baked so healthy me is unhappy with my cheese preference).   We also picked up a 1000 layer cake.   We decided to enjoy at home but I now wonder what they taste like fresh!     The cake was delicious,  not too sweet and it's like of like flakey buttery caramel- we learned that it started 3-4 thicker and takes 24 hours to make as it compresses into a heavy cake we bought.   One piece was MORE than enough to share.

Overall I'm a fan and will go back when I'm in that area again."}
{"text":"Homemade salsa is delicious! They make it Fresh every other day and will make you some to order if you call in advance. The empanadas are fresh with everything made in house. Filling to Dough ratio is spot on. Flavors are nice. Nothing too spicy here."}
{"text":"Most people seem to come here for the Empanada, but the dishes that are special for me are their sandwiches, especially the avocado and steak. My other favourites are the humitas, the pastel de choclo, the bistec a lo pobre. My favourite dish consists of steak, chorizo, french fries (real not frozen) and scrambled egg (its name has just slipped my mind just now). It does take about twenty minutes for them to prepare this dish, so if you are in a hurry pre-order it over the phone. I have been told that it is a favourite hangover recovery dish in Chile."}
{"text":"Tasty!  We had a beef sandwich and a spicy chicken empanada.  

The sandwich had thick strips of beef; usually I worry that big pieces of beef in an inexpensive dish will be chewy, but these were nice and tender.  The sandwich was flavorful, and interestingly, was the first one I'd ever had that had green beans in it.

The empanada was also tasty and was actually fairly spicy -- a great value for four bucks."}
{"text":"So good!  Food was quick and best of all delicious . It was my first time and I was really impressed with the friendly staff.  I always enjoy when they will make recommendations,  and give different tips to get the most from the dinning experience.  I will always be getting extra salsa as it was fresh and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Food is just average. The menu is limited and there is not much atmosphere. It is a decent place to spot by if you work near by and need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The empanadas are very good... And the sandwiches too.. The 
Location is hidden, but in general I would say is good... I liked everything I had... And the service was not bad... This place is good for informal lunch or breakfast..."}
{"text":"I work a couple of doors down so its been pretty tempting to pop in here a few times for lunch when I'm actually in the office.

I haven't found a bad empanadas yet. Probably my favourite right now is the chorizo. It nice and crispy and cooked to order instead of being warmed up."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Empanada Queen and did a takeout of 12 baked empanadas.  4 regular ground beef, 4 spiced ground beef & 4 spinach and feta.  They cost $42.00 cash (which was the best deal).  

Tried the spinach and feta baked empanada and it's so tasty!  The regular ground beef empanada is also so tasty (so I'm told).  The baked dough is so soft.  The pictures in help make it look like that they would taste hard and stiff but not so.  Will try the beef empanadas soon.  Update:  I tried the beef empanadas.  Gosh!  So good with a whole pitted black olive and a section of a hard-boiled egg!  

Will be back, Empanada Queen to try the other items in your menu!"}
{"text":"Love comming here!
Not only is the staff amazing but theres so many flavours in their empanadas.
I recommend the spinich! So tasty and vegeterian"}
