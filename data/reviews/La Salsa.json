{"text":"PERFECT!!

  My husband and I just got married in Vegas 2 weeks ago and had our welcome party at La Salsa Cantina and it was AWESOME!! They did a spectacular job. They were so nice, extremely accomodating and even the DJ they use (Yameel) was terrific. Waiters were on top of everything. Before I was done my beer they were there with a fresh one in hand :) It was the best and whenever we make it back out to Vegas we will be visiting again! 5 stars all the way :)
                                                                        Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Girls in the front total fail...one word Rude! They are the face of the the restaurant first person we encounter coming in and instead of greeting us they look at us like if they don't seem like they want us here"}
{"text":"Good food and good price,  had a Margarita which was good and strong.  I also had the Mexico city tacos which will fill you up!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the place is beautiful. But my order was wrong and the service was unbelievably horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Bland food and small portion for $14 meh service. Waste of 40 bucks. All dishes $12 and up."}
{"text":"Avoid the food. Besides the service never coming around to the table the food is bland and not really hot when delivered. 

I had a grande burrito and it had what looked like canned cubes of chicken in it--the kind you find in a plastic package in the grocery store. The chips and salsa, besides costing $2.50, were so over salted they were un-eatable. 

I saw my waiter three times the entire time. Once after five minutes of waiting at the table after being seated. Once to deliver a drink and then again to deliver the food.  That's it."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. Two entrees n a drink cost us $40. The quality of food didn't even deserve $1"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a couple drinks and a quick bite. We ordered a taco salad, which was REALLY boring. It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a sprinkle of cheese, tomatoes and beans; pretty disappointing for the price because this place is NOT cheap! Waitstaff were not around much. Overall, we would not go back again. 

Bottom line: the drinks were alright and although the food was super basic and overly priced, at least it was somewhat fresh so we didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I got a deal on travelzoo.com for my recent trip to Las Vegas. I thought it was a good deal...2 entrees and 2 margaritas plus this restaurant was on the strip at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. When we were seated and greeted by our server, we mentioned that we had the travelzoo deal. Once we said that, I think our service went downhill... 

--He asked if we wanted our margaritas on rocks or frozen...we asked for frozen. What did we get??? Margaritas on rocks! 

--I ordered the carne fajita platter. What did I get??? A chicken plate! 

I mean c'mon! Every other table got salsa and chips, it took us a good 5 min to flag down our server to ask for it and to tell him he got our orders wrong. What worried me the most was that it only took them a few minutes to bring out my carne asada platter. I would think that my meat would take longer to cook...I guess not!!! 

It frustrates me when restaurants offer travelzoo deals, groupons, etc and their service changes once you mention it! Just because you pay for a fraction of the meal doesn't mean I should get a fraction of the service. It's ridiculous. No matter what kind of deal I get, I always tip to the full price--so I don't understand why these businesses freak out and think they don't need to provide good service."}
{"text":"First post on Google Map Review - about a month ago:
Very tasty and fresh! Hidden Gem on the Strip. Definitely try the Nachos Appetizer with Chicken and extra cheese to share! Muy Bueno!!!

Update - 040415: Unfortunately I am updating this post to express my less than professional experience today at this establishment. Earlier today my wife and I decided we wanted to return to La Salsa for their very tasty nachos! We were both looking forward to getting our tastebuds awakened. Upon arrival the bartender was very short to say the least. She asked what we would like to order...We told her we were not ready. My wife stepped away to the restroom and the bartender asked again. I asked for water and politely stated that the order would be placed when my wife returned. Only one water was placed at our seating...Wife returned, we ordered, food was served quickly, margaritas were great...I asked my wife how was the Guacamole, she replied \"not good\"...from here it went downhill. We mentioned this to the bartender, and her response was \"What!!?? Our guacamole is amazing!\" I expressed to her we did not enjoy the dish and to please remove from our bill. Her response was since you have tasted it I cannot remove the item. We had ordered (2) 14.00 margaritas, Nachos for 10 to 12 dollars...were we really having a conversation about a 9.00 guacamole appetizer? She refused and I requested the manager. Manager shows up...almost in a scolding manner asking what was the issue. I expressed we did not like the guacamole and to remove from our ticket. He appeared to take it personal and once again in a scolding fashion asked what was wrong with the guacamole!!?? I expressed again we did not enjoy and wanted it removed from our bill. His response was have you eaten any...I replied, Yes we tasted this and determinated we did not like the dish. Finally he snipped \"Remove it from their tab\" Wow, really a 9.00 appetizer! I was highly agitated and stepped away to get some fresh air. Upon my return, my wife was visibly still bothered by the experience. The bartender had given us our check while we had half of the nachos remaining and we did not even ask for the check...The total bill was 44.00, the total came to 50.00 after a 6.00 tip. I requested to speak to the manager again, introduced myself, and extended my hand for a handshake. I begin to explain my point of view regarding the earlier encounter by showing him the previous post on Google Maps Review. I also explained to him that we primarily have eaten guacamole prepared tableside...and what we were served today was not tasty to us. I explained that there were not enough onions, spiciness, and salt. He explained that yes there is a difference between their guacamole and prepared fresh tableside was a difference. Their guacamole is made every four hours and made with sun dried tomatoes. He also explained how he was allergic to onions. He also stated that we were the first to ever complain about the guacamole. He was cordial and not as defensive as earlier. While I do understand him being taken back by our complaint...was it justified to come across as though we had done something wrong by expressing our opinion? We are talking abouy 9.00 dollars.  What I love about the USA is the free market choice and competition. There are quite a few other tex mex spots on the strip and we will be giving those a try. What bothers me the most is the first experience was excellent! Bartender was great! Service was great!! I am very disappointed. Later that evening we ended up at the Capital Grille bar on the Strip for a few martinis and their incredibly delicious lamb chops. As we sat there chatting with the bartenders and enjoying our drinks and meal...I was so thankful for Consistently Great Service! Thanks Capital Grille for a wonderful end to our evening. Oh and by the way the bill at Capital Grille was only 10.00 dollars more than La Salsa. Be mindful where your dollars are spent..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a few appetizers and drinks after a morning/afternoon of gambling in Vegas and from the outside La Salsa Cantina appeared to offer just that.  We were very wrong.  Six of us walked into the empty restaurant and we were quickly greeted by our server and we ordered 6 Tecates as soon as we sat down.  We then ordered an order of guacamole, queso and the steak nachos.  All of them were fairly tasteless and average at best (I would give the food 2 stars).  So our food comes out and we start eating, but our Tecates are nowhere to be found.  About 45 minutes later we are done with our meal and we ask for our check.  As he brings out our check and notices the Tecates on there he tells us he will be right back with our beers.  I politely told him that it's a little late for that and we just needed to leave to which he replied \"Oh, so you don't want the beers you ordered anymore?\".  The whole exchange was a little mind boggling and I wish I could have the 45 minutes of my life that I spent at La Salsa Cantina back.  

As we left and were walking to our next destination I noticed a Chiptole.  I have not eaten at this Chipotle, but I am postive that going to that Chiptole and spending 15 minutes eating a burrito and then the other 30 minutes as a handbiller passing out escort service cards to tourists while wearing an orange shirt that says \"Girls Girls Girls\" would have been more enjoyable than our 45 minutes at La Salsa Cantina."}
{"text":"My friend and I were only in Vegas for a day for a wedding and we hadn't eaten all day. The heat just made our hunger and thirst worse! So we stumbled upon La Salsa Cantina at Caesars Palace and were unsure if the outcome would be good or not. Usually places like this are over priced and the quality sucks.

Luckily, it wasn't like that! The food was so good. The menu is a small to fair selection. Typical mexican restaurants have pages and pages of food to choose from, but La Salsa only had a couple and they were great dishes to choose from.

I had a grande chicken burrito and my friend had street style carne asada tacos. I was indecisive whether to get the burrito or a enchilada stack! I choose the burrito and what a great choice it was. Both of our plates had great portions of beans, rice, and our main entree. I had black beans and my friend had pinto beans. 

The only complaint I have is they didn't serve chips and salsa for starters. I glanced at a table across and they had chips and salsa, but another table didn't. So I'm guessing they serve them upon request. No big deal. Our meals had us full for the rest of the day. Oh, and the bus boy wouldn't stop hitting on my friend! That was annoying. 

Anyway, I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great mexican food. I wish they had this place in Southern California!!!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast!!! A must do every time I come to Vegas... Go for the huevos rancheros or California omelet!!! Tequila sunrise drink special adds a great kick and start to your day in Vegas!! Service is good as well, very attentive..."}
{"text":"BEST MARGARITA EVER!  The chicken tacos were perfect and our waitress was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I was on the strip, after presenting a workshop at the Imperial Palace, and was craving some mexican.  I was debating driving over to the Hard Rock to eat at Pick Tacos or drive to my favorite mexcian, Viva Mercado's.  Then I saw La Salsa was in the Forum Shops.  I remember eating at La Salsa when it was at Neonopolis and enjoying the meal.  I walked in and was this close to walking out.  It did have a weird vibe.  But the waitress came before I had a chance to leave.  So I order my soda and am waiting for my chips and salsa.  I ask and was told that chips and salsa are not free.  Hmm, no free chips and salsa at a sit down mexican restaurant.  I was extremely let down.  The meal consisted of chicken and avacado enchiladas.  The meal was small, without much flavor, and had about a quarter of an avocado.  The meal cost $18.  

Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"If you are going to La Salsa to get a half yard or whatever of a margarita, go to 7-Eleven and get a slushie. The $26 48oz strawberry margarita I got tasted good, but after downing the entire thing, I didn't feel anything. To put things in prospective, the day prior I got a 48oz margarita from Fat Tuesday for $17 and I was good....really good for the entire night.

Go to Fat Tuesday if you want a good margarita to get drunk. 

Go to 7-Eleven if you want a good tasting slushie and save yourself $25"}
{"text":"If it wasnt for the food it would be a 3 its usually hit and miss on the service but very good food."}
{"text":"This was the worse service I have ever received. The restaurant was dead and we were seated promptly but rudely.  The food came out fast, which was the only positive part of this experience. Our waitress Patty, only came to our table once due to the fact that she needed to get our orders. We needed other things at our table and she never came by. We wanted to get our bill and we had to get a server come over to get Patty's attention. It took an additional 15 minutes to get our bill. Overall fast food but the service was terrible. Shout out to the cooks, too bad Patty couldn't give this restaurant another star."}
{"text":"We found this place after hours walking on the strip looking for something interesting.
We were just walking and suddenly listened to some loud salsa music.
Since,we're all Latinas we were so excited and just stopped by. It was like 11:30 pm and there was no line at all!! They asked us for IDs and there was no cover charge...Also there wasnt any dress code and they let us in with flip flops....
They Place its small, and its was too Crowded!! There werent any tables available so we had to stay up and just dance with the crowd. Drinks are good here for the price.

We ordered Margaritas Yardas and they were HUGE!! 
Bartenders and waiters are all latinos and very friendly. Music its a Mix of everything... Salsa,Bachata,Pop,Rock en Espanol,Cumbias,etc.... Nice if you're on the mood for some latin music and want to dance something different in Vegas.

The only thing i didnt like about this place its the bathroom. It only had 
2 bathrooms for that amount of ladies. I had to wait like 30 minutes for my turn. Also, they were very dirty and all wet, i had to cleaned it myself. By the way,i didnt come back again to use this bathroom.

Overall,i gave it 3 stars because its no dress code,nice latin music and No Cover Charge! I would come back!!"}
{"text":"We went there just to get a \"Margarita by the Yard.\"  It costs almost $20.  Nothing too much to complain about, they served it in a souvenir container.  The nice thing was we could held it around on the street during that July hot weather.  If I happened to be there again I think I might get that from Imperial Palace for $15.  Same thing but cheaper."}
{"text":"I own a place Sippers & Sloppers...Well while in Vegas we made it here several times..staff has always been great in the monrning..food will do in a pinch, Margs lil weak, but drink enough you will catch a buzz..Bloody Marys ask for dbl shot then they are great..to my favorite bartnder you know who u are and my waitress from Cali both of have always treated us great..
So the grade for La Salsa Food- B-
Price - D-
Staff - A
Drinks - A
Thanks guys - Hef...you know me"}
{"text":"A fun place for breakfast.  Especially if you have Rosie for a server.  And you don't have to break the bank to pay for it.  Hurray for the $3.95 option.  Plenty of food."}
{"text":"I loved that place!


 They have an amazing concept
You can order a huge cup filled with margarita or tequila! its like 5L big!


 They are typical mexican, but this margarita thing is the perfect thing if ur intending on getting drunk by lunch!


 midway through lunch, a woman comes over and takes a pictures of us.
5 minutes later she comes with a postcard sizes picture of us which she hands us for free.
the proposes to sell us the bigger picture for 10$.. well call us stupid tourists, call us suckers, we did buy the picture


 i think after 2L of tequila, anyone would have!
Happy drinking"}
{"text":"During our 6 day stay in Vegas, we happened upon this place our 3rd day. AWESOME!!!! Had $2 Coronas, $1 Bloodys, and excellent service. We then came for breakfast for the rest of our stay and. . .YUM!!!! If you're in the area of Planet Hollywood, this breakfast can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the Margaritas are some of the best on the strip and more potent than they taste.  They will add as much booze as you want (for an additional charge, of course) and will make those yard long margaritas on the rocks if you ask really nice.  Pro Tip: Don't race your friends to see who can drink their yard long first or you'll be siting out side next to gold painted street performer for a solid 15 minutes trying to get your bearings.  Now, the food (I ordered the Mexican Pizza) was AMAZING....granted I was wasted by the time it came due to said 'rita race, so very little wouldn't have been delicious at that point.  

Some might take issue with spending $20-35 on a yard long anything, especially in Vegas where the booze is \"supposed\" to flow freely, but if you think you're drinking for free when you plunk $60+ into a machine while you wait 30 minutes for the waitress to brink you your watered down well drink,  this becomes the steal of the century."}
{"text":"This was our best breakfast find while in Las Vegas. (Tucked away in the Mile of Mall.) Every bite was delicious, service was outstanding and the price was 'old Vegas.'"}
{"text":"Tasty food that came out very quick. Try the burrito, you won't be disappointed. 
For being right on the Strip this was our cheapest meal. 
We'd go again the next time we're out there."}
{"text":"I had grilled chicken and steak. The server was very attentive. I also had one of the big margaritas on the rocks w Jimador. Delicious! It's not authentic, but it was still very good. I would come back. The jalapeños toreados were spicy!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a brokendown shanty shack on the border. It hasnt been dusted in years and it took a few minutes between being seated and seeing our waiter.

That being said, the food was amazing! I would give 5 stars on food for sure. The prices are what youd expect on the strip but they have a few inexpensive options, specifically breakfast. I had the chicken enchiladas and was blown away by the flavor.

Please for the love of the gods clean your decorations. I know you are going for the cobbled together look but it looks like you take no pride in your place. Dusting would have given you 5 stars."}
{"text":"Average to good food. We generally stop here for one lunch during our Vegas trips. The food is reasonably priced for Vegas. The cocktails are a little overpriced though."}
{"text":"I got the steak and shrimp fajitas, came with rice and beans and also got two Cadillac margaritas, it was delicious.  Service was great and everyone else enjoyed their meal as well.  Great way to start off our first night in Las Vegas.  We felt full but not heavy full, which is saying something when it's Mexican food."}
{"text":"The service was anything but.  Service? Is that what these folks call what there hourly workers provide?  It was more like \"I'm here where's my money\".  The food? Cold, dry chicken that was prepared earlier in the week and likely not at this location.  Fish tacos? No, that is the simplest and nicest way to say it.  One more thing, casadeis were cold, appeared to be made in a microwave and minimal.  Then I get the bill...  $12.00 for what should have been a $3.00 casadei.  No that was not a question.  Places like this have no business being in business and are the best reason I know to stay home."}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced food on the strip.  Gamble and come here to recover.  Across from NYNY.  They serve at the bar, and the food is great.  A secret treasure."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we could not find the restaurant we were looking for. So, yes, it was an accident, but we were greeted very friendly and they had great specials to eat a good meal for pretty cheap. The food is not amazing, so I will tell you that it your looking for the meal or your life, it's not here. However, it was good, we were not disappointed and we both enjoyed our meals, drinks and resting our tired feet. The prices were also great, we were enjoying Vegas on a budget and this fit in well. My husband meal was a drink/corona special, so it worked great for him! I had a cheapie margarita and was happy with it and my meal.
We would go back. Easy to find, right on the strip next to the M&M store, good specials, friendly waiters and overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Sergio is awesome!  I love this place!  Totally recommended. Good food and awesome service!!"}
{"text":"Got seated after 5 min of waiting. Sat at the bar and waited 15 min. Waitresses looked at me, smiled but didn't serve me. I finally just left and went to the all you can eat pancakes for $7.95 at New York New York. Worth it."}
{"text":"That place sucks bad!! The rice tasted like it was out of an Uncle Ben microwaveable bag, the tacos were dry and the bean tasted like they were out of a can!! To top it off one of the managers was yelling and cursing at the cooks in Spanish calling them worthless!! I can't believe my girlfriend and I payed $60 bucks for dinner!! I would say Taco bell is a better option!! Worst so called \"Mexican\" food I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place has beckoned to my wife and me ever since we moved here two years ago, so we figured \"what the heck.\"  Bad choice.  I ordered the house Margarita, it tasted like.... well I can't even properly describe the strange flavor, but it certainly did not taste as a Margarita should, and at $8 and change I expect better.  THANK GOODNESS I didn't order the large (yard) size.  As an appetizer we had the Poblano cheese dip, came with lots of chips, but was luke-warm and if not for the healthy injection of hot sauce we provided, would have been completely bland.  For an entree we shared a large burrito with grilled chicken, or at least it was supposed to have chicken.  I was lucky to find two small pieces of chicken in my half, my wife's experience was similar.  And when delivered to our table, our waitress warned us the plate was hot.  It was, but the burrito was not!  What the *uck??  The waitress was polite and attentive, but the food/drink at this place is sub-par.  Don't."}
{"text":"Horrible! The server Valentin practically kicked us out before finishing our meal because they needed our table for a party of ten when we were 5. Never going back again."}
{"text":"I will come here every time I visit. Burrito was banging. They up sold me in pictures they take right there but its cool..."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC Mexican food! Don't bother with high priced DiAblos at the Monte Carlo on the other side of the street! Better prices and food is delicious! Waiters were great! And the margarita yard was yummy too!"}
{"text":"For starters the host was very welcoming and funny loved it...sat at the bar drinks are great...bartender great...music great goes with theme \"it's mexican ppl..relax\"  youre still in there for margaritas and beer specials. Great place"}
{"text":"Staying nearby at the MGM Grand and saw this place offering $4.95 breakfasts. 2 eggs, choice of meat, potatoes and tortillas. Food quality was good, service was friendly, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos which were good. The salsa that my friends got with their tacos was amazing. However, the \"best margarita you'll ever have\" was the worst margarita I've ever had. Especially for $15 it was also the smallest one I've had for the piece. Also the bartender, Alex, was more concerned about picking up the tourist next to us than he was about his bartending."}
{"text":"Just came back from Vegas and of course had to go eat my lime-chile salad.  Still yummy!  Went back twice to eat my salad and each time also tried something else (steak quesadillas and chicken fajitas) . . . those were yummy too!  Went to both the one in Showcase Mall and Planet Hollywood Miracle Miles Shops and both of them had great service."}
{"text":"We came here immediately after checking in to our hotel room for my friend's bachelorette party. She wanted tacos and was in a hurry to get them (and was also looking for cheap food), so we wandered and the indecisive group ended up here. It was a typical Tex Mex joint. My food was good, but not anything memorable and the price point was pretty \"Vegas Tex Mex\". The memorable part of the lunch was our server, who gave us drinking/recovery tips and was happy to joke around with the group. Margaritas on the rocks were pretty tasty too! Overall, this was a pretty low-key way to start our trip."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty damn good. We were actually trying to eat someplace else and ended up here because the sushi place we wanted to go to wasn't open for lunch. I'm glad we stumbled in here. I think it suffers because of its location in the forum shops; I'm sure they get very little foot traffic walking by. 

Good drinks, very good chips and salsa and guac, and the enchiladas, tacos, and quesadillas were all quite good - a step above your typical tex-mex fare. The whole menu was texmex essentially so nothing too exotic but what they do prepare they seem to prepare well.

The place is pretty small so it's not much of a \"scene\" but as far as strip restaurants go it's fairly affordable and definitely fills you up."}
{"text":"Okay !! I don't know where to begin with this place ! It was my first time ever going to La Salsa cantina and their food is so amazing !! My boyfriend and I arrived to Vegas on Friday night and we stumbled upon this little gem right on the strip! They had great music and great drinks !! We went back Saturday morning for lunch and we were blown away by their nachos! Those are a must!! 
We had a problem with a transaction, however the manager Mr. Marco was so professional and over all such a great person! I will certainly be coming back in my next trip to Vegas!! :)"}
{"text":"I ate everything! Wonderful flavor, it's great walking into a Mexican restaurant and not only seeing a Hispanic staff but also seeing several Hispanic families as patrons. Definitely will visit again"}
{"text":"How do you say \"boo yah\" in Spanish? 

This place is the bomb diggs. Spent the week in Vegas with my friend and we got a TEENSY WEENSY bit tired of spending $20+ on breakfast every morning, so we ventured out to the strip to see what else Sin City had to offer our grumbling (but tan) bellies. 

La Salsa Cantina looks super chachki, with a giant margarita glass out front that albeit screams \"eat here for free diarrhea!\" But right next to that is a small sign that advertises $3.95 breakfast. Could it be?! Is it edible?!

I am both pleased -- and weary, because I don't want to give away the secret -- to tell you that it IS real and it IS edible. Beyond edible, actually enjoyable. For your hard earned 4 one-dollar bills, you get eggs, homefries, two tortillas and a choice of meat. I also asked for cheese on my scrambled eggs, and wrapped up all the ingredients into a delicious breakfast burrito. TO DIE FOR. 

Went twice and it was equally good the next morning.

Not sure if being so cheap made the food taste better, or if maybe I still had some extra alcohol in my system, but my mouth is literally watering thinking about how good this meal was. It's still essentially diner food, so no need to get all hot and bothered, but a great option and a TON of bang for your buck.

If you're in Vegas -- GO."}
{"text":"Looking for a decent price dinner on the Strip? Look no further!  

Started with the Caipirinha (Brazil's national rum drink)--was good, they were not light handed with the rum.  For $13, they better not be light handed!

Had the fish tacos entree.  Came with fresh sliced avocado and rice and beans.  The beans were a little weird, not quite black beans, not quite re-fried?  I didn't eat them, but I'm not a bean fan.  Had a delicious sauce on the fish tacos, can't remember what it was exactly, but definitely had some Ranch in it.  The fish was also seasoned beautifully.
Husband had a green chile burrito dish and really enjoyed that as well.  

We went early for dinner (5:30ish) and so it was dead which was nice because we got good attention from the server.  However, we also watched two other servers eat their dinners in front of us.  Thought maybe there should be a staff area where they can eat out of view of guests.
Wish we had been able to go for breakfast- sounded amazing!  
No happy hour special, which was a bummer.

Not 5 stars because I think with the atmosphere of the place, they could lower their prices a bit.  They were not a fancy cantina or even semi-fancy."}
{"text":"I have to give some love to this particular slightly-upscale La Salsa. It's one of the few places you can sit outside just a few feet away from the Strip sidewalk, and all the people-watching that affords.

Do this on a warm night with a couple friends and a round of margaritas, and it really doesn't matter how good the food or service are."}
{"text":"We wanted something low key , quick to seat , with TV for watching NFR. Found a seat at the bar , ordered stacked shrimp enchiladas and they were awesome!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and the food was okay, drinks were cheap and menu was low priced. It was great to sit outside and the service was fast!"}
{"text":"Corporate mexican food? Kill me now!

On our most recent trip to Vegas, my gf and I were looking to get a quick bite and we saw this spot. Here goes;

The GOOD: The decor is nice, pretty spot. I think that's what wooed us. We sat at the bar, so we were waited by the bartender, nice guy. Quick service.

The BAD: The food. It's as bland as rice cakes. 

The UGLY: The fact that in such an amazing food city...we ended up here :("}
{"text":"Chose this place walking by at Caesar's on our last day before heading to the airport. Although service was a little slow, the food was really good.

The guacamole and chips with two salsas was a great deal for $9. More than two hungry people could eat. I got the chicken falautas. Some of the best I have had. Came with a side of guacamole, sour cream and queso fresca. 

Filling, could only eat half of my meal! Not a bad deal with a beer my tab was about $40, but two could have shared the falautas.  I will remember this place next time I am in LV."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast served hot and fast; just the right blend of flavors providing a well rounded satisfaction, superseded only by our service provided by Manuel."}
{"text":"Those slushy drinks are good but not very strong.  Bartender was super friendly."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to get my grove on. Love, love, love the music. Great selection on real Latin music. The DJ definitely keeps you dancing all night from my favorite cumbias, salsa and bachata. I also had dinner with my friends. The food is forgettable, nothing worth bragging about and service is good. Drinks are of course over priced because this is located right on the strip. I ordered a pina colada, was very delicious but very weak. I also ordered a Long Island and got more of my money's worth there. I will definitely be back tho for those Latin nights."}
{"text":"Rose was our waitress she was amazing.  Food was good. We had the 4.95 breakfast,  it was just perfect for me. Y son had the frenchtoast Amazing!! I will write more, just quick reviews so I don't forget!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for a casual lunch break from shopping. I found out about this place from the Travelzoo deal where 2 people eat an entree and have a margarita for $25 (regularly $58). 

I was expecting it to be like La Salsa Cantina or an upgraded Taco Bell but I was pleasantly surprised. The setting is nice, reminded me of a more quiet Cheesecake Factory. It's located in the Forum Shops and the windows provide a great spot for people watching. Our waitress was nice and helpful and our food arrived in a timely fashion.

We upgraded our margaritas to the premium ones for an extra $2 each and we both enjoyed it. It was not watered down at all and you could taste the tequila in it. I got the fish tacos which were the best fish tacos I have tasted. My boyfriend got the fajitas which he enjoyed but I preferred my fish tacos over his meal. The chips and salsa are no longer complimentary but we paid the extra $4.95 for them which we enjoyed. You get 4 types of salsa with it.

Overall, I would visit here again and pay the full price."}
{"text":"Came here with no expectations, only to get a quick meal and some dranks! super casual atmosphere and yes it is a lil touristy. 

Their drinks were pretty good and strong. Had (of course) the pina colada. Most of the people at the table got the corona/margarita.

For food had a mix of beef and chicken tacos. It was pretty decent. Big portions. Staff was super friendly. 

Overall, I left happy and with a lil buzz.....and suffered no GI distress. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not bad...decent food for a decent price.  

Had the shrimp and avocado salad...yum!"}
{"text":"We ate at the location in the miracle miles mall. Best breakfast for under $4!! We made our own little burrito with eggs, bacon potatoes and tortillas. Their coffee with baileys was good as well. My friend had the .99 cents Bloody Mary and liked it as well (warning it's a little small but for .99 what do you expect."}
{"text":"Good food, great value for money. Check out the burrito challenge with the yard of Margarita - tough to finish, but delicious and worth a free t shirt!"}
{"text":"I brought my family & friends for lunch on Saturday April 26, 2015. We have been here numerous times, so I was looking forward to having a good time with my family. Unfortunately, this time was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I will never set foot in this place because the manager lacks the skills she needs to run a restaurant or a business for that manner. 

Our waitress took our order for our drinks. She brought out  some of the drinks for the adults but forgot our kids drinks.  Another 15 minutes pass and she comes back and starts asking us, what would we like to drink? We were all confused because she already took our order. After another 20 minutes pass and we had to remind he that our kids didn't have their drinks. So she finally brings them & takes our order for our food. 

The waitress brought 2 orders of guacamole with chips. My friends started eating them because they had ordered place one order. When she realized they brought an extra order by mistake, she picked up from the table. She didn't bother to ask if we wanted to keep them. I thought that was really rude. 

My wife order a michelada at the bar. It tasted horrible so I asked the another waiter if they could make her another one. He said sure but the manager has to approve it. The manager came over & I asked me what was the problem. I told her, \"my wife bought a drink and it's horrible can you have a differs bartender make it?\" She got upset grabbed the glass and started to walk away. I then said \" All I expect is good customer service.\" She turned around and tried to argue with me. She told me, \"what you're not getting good customer service?\" I respond, \"honestly no. How am I getting good service when my kids can't even get a drink. I had to keep asking for my kids drinks. That's horrible don't you think?\" She then told me, \"do you want an appetizer?\" I responded, \"No, I want good customer service. That's all I expect.\" She left with my wife's drink and never brought her another one. My wife had to ask another bartender for a drink. 

About an hour after we ordered our food, we finally got our  food. My burrito was ok but for the price I paid I expect better. I had a steak burrito. My wife's fajitas were delicious. Unfortunately, she had to ask like three time for tortillas. My friend's sampler was cold. They didn't even eat it. The beans are horrible don't get them. 

There were two other couples that complained about the service. They walked out mad cussing out the manager too because she was being rude to them as well. 

The manager never came back to apologize to me or my family. The waitress gave us a discount of our bill. I paid my bill & tipped the lady even though I had bad service. I understand it must be hard for servers. I am more upset with the horrible manager. She is the one that needs training!!! Thanks to her I will never come back!!!!!!


Note: Margarito (bartender) makes really good micheladas."}
{"text":"Just had the - New Shrimp tacos - even Chillis makes and serves them better. Terrible food. Disappointed, used to be my go to place in Vegas with all daily meals. No more in 2015 ! Detiorated."}
{"text":"Four Stars for Vegas Breakfast.  Had the Breakfast special.  It was a fantastic bargain for $3.95.  Only a few paces away at the MGM where I was staying and would have paid 3 or 4 times that much.  It was busy, but the staff did well despite being overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service, reasonable prices. Breakfast is served until noon =) Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, lacking some on \"Mexican\" atmosphere. Would definitely recommend. Good value, especially on The Strip! Had Chili Lime Salad with chicken. My husband had nachos."}
{"text":"La Salsa has a great cheap breakfast.  For $4.29 you get 2 eggs, any style, choice of bacon, sausage or ham, potatoes and corn or flour tortillas.  The staff was friendly and service was excellent.  Went back for dinner while in town and experienced the same great service and good food.  La Salsa has great prices for being on the strip and the food is good."}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos to share and they were INSANE!! Had like 4 different kinds of cheese with steak, 2 different types of peppers, beans, etc. Margaritas were 2-for-1 and the service was GREAT! Nice place to stop for a quick bite and cold drink before heading out to the strip!"}
{"text":"We were hungry, it was late, this place is great! Easy access (on the strip), the food is good and not too expensive (dishes from $10-$13)."}
{"text":"We've gone here 3 or 4 times on our Vegas trips,  and I've enjoyed it every time. The food is a little more expensive than what we normally pay for Mexican food,  but it's good and is still one of the best deals you can find for food on the strip."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Prices were steep for the quality. Even the salsa they give at the beginning w/ the chips was just mediocre.  I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Where to start.... Service was slow, food was dull.
Carnesada burrito had hardly any meat. Rice was blah and dry. Steak fajitas were actually pretty good, could of done with out so many onions and bell peppers.
We had to pay for the chips and salsa which was $2.99 but then u get unlimited after the first serving.
Got a really great drink but that was $10 don't think that was worth it.
Our total bill for two people not including tip was $53
FOR MEXICAN FOOD that wasn't even great.
They get two stars, cool atmosphere and and tasty drink"}
{"text":"Service was bad. it was slow hardly anyone in the restaurant and four of is sat down waited a while before I had to say \"can we get some service please \" couldn't tell if the girls at the front were promoters or hostess."}
{"text":"In the land of over priced, non authentic , all show no substance food, this place was a gem. Walking down the strip not wanting to pay $20 for a simple breakfast we came across this place. They had a $4.99 breakfast meal and other options that did not break the bank. It was so good that we went back twice for breakfast. The food was good, authentic home style food. The first day I had chilaquiles and two eggs over easy and they were great. I felt like I was eating a home, second day I had the huevos rancheros and again they were phenomenal . I am glad we stopped by for the breakfast it gave us a break from the over priced meals in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, what happened to La Salsa margaritas!! We ordered a couple of margaritas and it seemed they were made with an overload of sugar. When they were located in the middle of the Forum Shops, they had that very distinctive tart and tequila taste. Now, they taste like your typical chain Mexican restaurants - indistinguishable!! La Salsa please go back to your original recipes and maybe your location - it was much more fun there. Also, your hostess must have been bored lighting and burning matches at the host stand and watching them burn till the very end."}
{"text":"Fast service with great quality food! I recommend the fajitas!! I got the enchiladas that's we're okay but my boyfriend had the chicken and shrimp fajitas that were delicious! We'll definitely be recommending this place to other and return ourselves!!"}
{"text":"I could not believe that this place charges for chip and salsa since it is a \"Mexican\" restaurant. It wasn't expensive at $2.95, but really?! I ordered the grilled baja fish taco which was extremely dry, the black beans were alright, and the rice hard. My BF ordered chicken tacos which were also dry, but totally not edible! This was a complete waste of money that ended up being pricey after you add the drinks!!"}
{"text":"Had the $3.95 breakfast which included two eggs, potatos, two flour tortillas and sausage or bacon (paid $1.25 extra for bacon). Good, solid breakfast with just the right amount of food."}
{"text":"We ate there twice this week and it was great. Breakfast special was 2 eggs  meat and home fries with tortillas for $4.95. Dinner was chicken enchiladas with rice and beans for $11 with a free mohito. Both were fantastic. I don't understand why the place was empty as it was the best deal on the strip."}
{"text":"Good spot to eat on the strip...

Sat at the bar and got great service from Margarito.

Ordered the sampler and everything tasted good.

Just didn't like that they took a picture of our group then tried selling us the picture for a ridicoulis amount."}
{"text":"Their El Champion Burrito was VERY delicious!"}
{"text":"I'd been to other La Salsa locations in Vegas, and they have never done me wrong.  I went to this location because I was starving in the middle of the day, and wanted a cheap meal with a beer.  La Salsa advertised both a lunch and beer special on sandwich boards on the sidewalk, which sounded great, so I obviously I'm going inside.  

There is a bar near the front, so you can still get some sunlight, and they have video poker!  SOLD!  I drop some cash in the VP machine, order the beer special, follow it up with the lunch special, and I'm good to go.

Strike 1 - The bartender comes back 10 minutes after I order my meal, and he says that they are out of the lunch special, and hands me a menu.  It's 3-frigin'-30 in the afternoon, and they're already out of the lunch special?!?  How about taking down the sandwich board outside so more people don't get rooked into buying a meal that's twice as expensive as they planned??  FYI, they didn't take down the sandwich board.  I ordered something else, and it was decent.  And how do you run out of Mexican food?  Everything has the same ingredients, it's just packaged different.  And this was a basic burrito.

Strike 2 - None of my beers were comped.  Whoa whoa whoa, what??  Is this Russia?  This isn't Russia.  Really, is this Russia?  What bar doesn't comp beer for playing?  I've been to one or two in my life, but they let you know up front.  

So I lost money in the machine (as I expected), paid for my beers (not expected when playing), and bought a lunch that was twice as expensive as they advertised (never crossed my mind that would happen).

This La Salsa either intentionally rips people off by LYING that they don't have a certain dish left, they have terrible business practices, or they are incompetent.  I am NOT going back to this La Salsa ever again, and the other locations probably lost my business as well."}
{"text":"We had a decent Southwest/TexMex breakfast there. It was fresh, hot, inexpensive (by the Vegas Strip's standards) , and the food was simple but comforting and decent tasting. So, I definitely recommend the place for a simple southwest-style breakfast."}
{"text":"When it comes to the strip everything costs money but this place was reasonable price and the food were good.  I love most the mango margarita for $9 and if you buy the big one that you take home it costs only $19.  They had a very good enchilada de Camarons it's kind a spicy and well done good.  Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The mango salsa is FABULOUS!!! Pleasant experience!!! GREAT FOOD! Great service! Had the carnitas fajitas and they were bomb! And the waiter was amazing!!! Thanks Rodrigo!!! GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY. It will not be regretted."}
{"text":"BOO!

I'll give it 2 stars only because the chicken in my burrito was flavorful.  However, I think the only things I really got out of my meal were a stomach ache and a horrible \"morning after bathroom raid\".  

Our service was terrible - I am not sure whether our server was actually very busy, or he was just a little high strung and had too much caffeine in him, but everything he said was quick to us in a breathless type of manner (think post-marathon), he never really stopped over, and we waited at least 15 minutes for drinks.

Ack."}
{"text":"Baja fish tacos are the best! The fish is Wahoo and perfectly prepared. My friends got a salad that looked crazy good and enchiladas.  The enchiladas that I had to taste were steak and fantastic.  Great slot for a margarita too with outdoor seating and courteous service."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins and the drinks are great ! The food is super bland though , I didn't think it was possible to eat a nacho I didn't like. I would come back but only for happy he."}
{"text":"We stumbled on to this place and decided to go in. It was pretty quiet because it was between breakfast and lunch which was nice. We ended up getting the Mexico City tacos and the Baja fish tacos and I have to say that the food as delicious. The service was incredibly friendly, and the margaritas hit the spot. One of the guys fixed our margarita which entailed adding more tequila, so I'd definitely recommend this place! The guacamole was very tasty and they had a nice smokey chipotle salsa."}
{"text":"I come to this place a lot, tonight a LOUD drunk at 6:30 pm was running off customers. What is worst they keep serving this drunk!!!  Juan was thinking it was funny. This drink could kill someone later tonight  Sitting at bar like I normally due. Not sure I will come back manager on Dufy should of handled this BEFORE he got more shots and then more beer. It almost 7 pm and he is still going strong and again VERY loud including using the F work this is a restaurant with small kids, come on someone throw out this drunk! Or put him in a cab at lease STOP serving him,"}
{"text":"I come every trip to the strip, small bar and restaurant but great service. Tonight was great service Wanderley is great bar tender and is fun to hang out with at bar. Marco the manager is friendly and engages the guests. If you are on strip stop by great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Come here for the bar, not the food.

The food was okay nothing special, the service was okay, the food did come out quick, but just wasn't impressed. Can't recommend the margaritas either, maybe it was just me but mine tasted like straight up over sweetened smoothie.

Did stop here on a club crawls and did have a lot of fun a the bar though.

This is one of those places you end up at, not quite a destination."}
{"text":"In early September, we ate at this location twice for breakfast.  I always love a good deal and they had good deals for breakfast. They had an awesome breakfast special.  For $3.99, you got 2 eggs; potatoes; your choice of ham, sausage or bacon; and either flour or corn tortillas.  It was an awesome, filling breakfast.  They had bloody mary's for only $.99.  It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was spicy which I like.  The service was excellent.  We had the same server both times and she was really personable and took good care of us.  It was also nice that she remembered us.  I would highly recommend trying them out.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had never been to a La Salsa before, but my friend who lives in town convinced me to join him for a bite to eat and some drinks the other night.  He said La Salsa's are located all over town, and that they are pretty consistent.  I decided to give it a try.

The food was surprisingly good, but the woman serving at the bar was a character.  We asked how her day was going and she replied with \"I am torn up\".  I didn't ask if she had eaten the food.

The carnitas were very good.  I had a beer.  My friend (a bartender) ordered a drink that required a snifter.  It was funny because he watched the bartender wash his glass in a sink with dirty plates in it and then dry the inside of the glass with her bar rag.  He was grossed out.  I reminded him the alcohol killed any germs.

My advice is to get a table because what you don't know won't hurt you."}
{"text":"Last night me and my friend decided to go to la salsa cantina and dance all night but they had that night the worst DJ ever, music was lame i didn't even dance. The chips and salsa were good overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"First lets start with late night entry... We had a party of 9 and one of us was wearing shorts.  They absolutely refused to let us in because of that. There was like 2-3 people in there that walked out with shorts right when they were telling us that shorts weren't allowed. Uhhh really? When we brought it to their attention, all the \"supervisor\" said was \"They were here before I got here.\" One of them even had sandals on! We decided to just split up and a few of us stayed in there, only reason was really because my girlfriend likes the enchiladas from there and because we just didn't want to walk anymore. That was just the entrance, didn't get much better after that. 

We were given our table fairly quick and our order was taken shortly after. I believe I had a burrito but it was not that great. If you go in large parties be aware that there is a gratuity charge AND a \"service charge?\" Yeah go figure, looked more like a phone bill to me. 

I would've given them 1 star but my girlfriend really likes going for the enchiladas, I like the music they play, we were sat promptly, and there was some short guy dressed like Michael Jackson that made me laugh lol. All in all, decent place but there's definitely room for improvement and dress code consistency."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast special. Nice people that work there. I eat there at least twice a week."}
{"text":"La Salsa is a nice little oasis just off the strip. I usually sit at the bar as there is a TV and you are away from their boom box. Service is AOK ad they offer good pours of tequila and a michelada to cure those LV hangovers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lite dinner and apps. Service at the bar was excellent. One of the few places on the strip where a small glass of beer is $10. Normal prices. relaxing atmosphere off the crazy strip."}
{"text":"Best breakfast deal in Las Vegas $4,95....great customer service breakfast on table in less than 10 min..delicious coffee too..Skip Starbucks while in Vegas..They are a rip off here."}
{"text":"Strange experience - this review is about the service.  My friend and I were looking for a place for dinner and spotted this outdoor La Salsa near Caesar's on the Strip.  We walked in and the waiter told us to sit anywhere.  My friend choose a table, we sat down and I noticed that the chair was not aligned to the table but rather off to the side.  In order to have the table in front of me, I moved the chair next to me over so I could slide my chair over.  In doing so, the chair brushed up against the empty chair of the table behind me and I heard a bang.  Apparently, the one person at the table behind me had propped a case upright against the back of the chair and my jostling his chair caused it to fall to the ground.  The waiter rushed over and I apologized to the guy behind me.  He said it was no problem because it was just a metal tripod.  He even took it out to examine it.  The waiter fussed around a bit also but when I was assured that nothing was broken, I turned back to my friend.  My friend then whispers to me that the waiter is \"trash-talking\" about me to the customer behind me.  I listen a little and turn around asking, \"Are you sure it's not broken?\"  The customer behind reassured me that it was fine and said that next time he would lay it on the chair and not prop it up.  The waiter walked away and my friend says, \"The waiter is still trash-talking you.\"  He apparently was back in the service area pointing at us and talking to a colleague.  My friend said, \"Let's get out of here.\"  I wasn't convinced the waiter was still talking about me but when we stood up, the waiter rushed over.  I handed him the menus and made an excuse that my friend didn't see anything on the menu he liked.  The waiter then shocked me by saying, \"The next time you need to be more careful.\"  I was like, what, I was just moving my chair - he shouldn't have propped his case upright on the chair.  The waiter yells at me, \"NO, YOU NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL.\"  I'm thinking, wow, this guy's going to punch me.  My friend is waving me towards the exit and I just walk away ASAP.  La Salsa, as a former waiter of many years, I suggest you might want to terminate unstable employees.  Your food looked good - sorry we couldn't stay to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Aiyaaah. $15 for a burrito...my wallet was sighing.

Came here expecting a pretty easy process to grab a burrito to go. Guess you should go somewhere else for that. My friend and I wanted to escape the overpriced food court next door w/ $8 Subway footlongs and $4 Wendy's chicken. We decided on burritos, and just shelled out the money hoping for a legit burrito. After waiting 15-20 mins, we were less than satisfied for the amount we paid but at least we got beans and rice on the side which was nice. Perhaps I am too used to Chipotle and other legit Mexican places...well now I know."}
{"text":"Ok let's talk about the 3.95 breakfast !! And the breakfast drinks!!! Place was good! Awesome atmosphere! We were there July 5th so of course the worldcup game was on and it was live!!! Recommend !!!"}
{"text":"This is a slightly upscale location of the chain. The food is always consistent and they offer vegetarian options which is a  big plus. It is in the quality of Chipolte and Baja Fresh. The food is good for quick Mexican food. I would give the food 3.5 stars. The bar is a great addition and gets the extra star in my rating. Good staff, good food, its worth stopping in if you are on the strip or looking for a  good place to drink/eat without taking  much time.."}
{"text":"This place was pretty atrocious.  I had the fajita burrito and the beef was so touch I could hardly get it down.  The food was exceptionally bland.  It's like whoever cooked it had never heard of salt, onion or cilantro.  My friend and I both left extremely disappointed and didn't even take our leftovers."}
{"text":"The four stars is strictly for the breakfast special. Especially the price - $3.95 for two eggs, potatoes(which were the bomb diggity), choice of meat, and tortillas. $.99 mini bloody Marys were not too shabby either. Service was decent.  Great value for being on the strip."}
{"text":"I want to dedicate these three stars to a waiter named Javier, because HE was four stars, the food was two, thus averaging out the star count to 3. This gentleman was what a good server should be: engaging, funny, polite and friendly. Attentive. Because of him, I had a very pleasant visit. I'm gonna be honest and say that I didn't really like the food although I really enjoyed the steak quesadilla I ate. Starting off with the chips and salsa, the chips are on point. Ours were fresh out of the fryer and nice and crunchy. The salsa, FAKE. No spice, nothing nice, and I felt like those cowboys in the commercial that say: \"This stuff was made in New York City!!!\" The queso fundido and the guacamole were outstanding though, and went perfectly with the tortilla chips.

Moving on to the rest of the food, AGAIN, FAKE BEANS AND FAKE RICE. BOO!!!!! You can't fake the Mexican, cause a real Mexican and real Mexican food lovers will know what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like and in all of my 37 years of eating Mexican food, I've never tasted rice like that before. IF you've ever seen buffets or cafeteria lines whip out a bag of pre-cooked rice and then pour it in to a tray, you get it and it has like a rubbery/plastic taste and texture, you'll know what I'm talking about. Puro Rice-A-Roni/Uncle Ben status. My wife and I shared a shrimp enchilada plate, and I felt that they could have been a little spicier, but overall were not bad.

My only real complaint about this place is that breakfast isn't served all day. It's only served till 12 pm, and I don't know about you, but who gets up before 12 pm in Vegas? I had wanted chilaquiles and a cheap bloody mary, but sadly, I couldn't get either because 12 pm had passed, sniff, sniff. Maybe I should get up earlier next time so I can try their breakfast. Overall, I think I'd come back because their drinks looked very tasty!"}
{"text":"I almost gave this place 1 star, but since our waitress didn't question our alcoholism [too much] and added more tequila to our drinks upon request, I decided to give it 2.

We had just landed in Vegas and were craving huge margaritas and snacks. Since it was almost noon (that's 3 oclock dc time okay?), we were seated right away. The cheapest margarita was $9, which in Vegas is not a lot at all, but if I'm going to pay $9 for the shittiest alcohol they have, there better at least be a lot of it in my drink. There wasn't...so we asked the waitress if they could add a bit more alcohol (obviously asians age well so maybe she thought I was like 18 or something and gave me a virgin). She basically rolled her eyes, but brought it back with a nice shot on top. Cool. 

We ordered only a few guacs and quesos for the table and she basically rolled her eyes again (sorry this was our first day, not ready to be big spenders yet). Both tasted fine, nothing special. HOWEVER, each dip came with a plate of like 10 stale chips. R U serious??? But luckily enough for us the bowls that the guac and queso came in were edible so obviously we crushed those.

Also, the waitress was confused x1000000 when we split the bill. All we did was put down the amount each person owed next to their last name on the receipt so I'm not really sure why she didn't get it."}
{"text":"the service was terrible... our server didn't have an ounce of personality--- maybe she was having a bad day... but when I go out, I like a friendly server!  We started with the queso (was actually REALLY yummy)  then I got TWO shredded chicken tacos with rice (flavorless and dry).. and hubby got a beef burrito with rice... We both got a lil plastic cup (i'd guess 12oz cup) of margarita... bill= 75 dollars... Most expensive / didn't get what I paid for meal of my life, i think.  

We were both a little hungover, so this might have something to do with it..... but we both felt queazy as we left the restaurant.  We went back to our room and we both violently puked until it hurt :(

puking up a 75 dollar taco kinda sucks."}
{"text":"32 oz. margaritas to enjoy while walking the strip? Yes, please!
My friend and I did not believe in sharing and got 2 separate ones of the lemon-lime margarita-yummy! The service was fast and the bartender was very nice. She was even understanding and polite when we ordered the wrong thing and she had to remake our drinks.

For two 32 oz. drinks it cost $30. Great price considering the amount of alcohol we were consuming.

Note: Do not ride a roller coaster after downing this..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give out negative stars, but alas, that's not possible. This tourist trap is located at Showcase Mall, right next to M&M World on the Strip. It's right next to MGM and across the street from New York New York.

Their \"specialty\" is margaritas by the yard. So, my posse is walking down the Strip towards our hotel, The Excalibur. Me and my homey Dead Mike decide to stop and gits us an $18 margarita. For $18 it has to be good, right? WRONG! 

I got a berry margarita, I think Mike got raspberry. They both sucked. I don't think either of them had more than a drop ot tequila. By the time I finished my margarita I thought I was going to get sick just from all the pre-mixed artificial berry concentrate, and I was sober. Mike just stopped drinking his. What was the point? 

For $18 there needs to be an ample amount of tequila in a drink. Hell, for $18 it should all be top shelf with pure agave. Instead, this place dumps some concentrate into a blender with some pre-mixed margarita. The \"advantage\" is seemingly that in Vegas you can walk around with a drink in your hand.

Well, if I want to walk around with non-alcoholic margaritas I can do that at Disneyland. I get infuriated when I think about the nerve of this place."}
{"text":"I stopped to grab a quick lunch here and I really enjoyed the fish tacos.  Grilled mahi, not fried, nice slice of avocado on them, rice and beans were fine.  Wait staff was attentive but not smothering...."}
{"text":"Great service! Good salsa and guacamole! I had a michelada, it was basic and rimmed with salt. I prefer Tajin."}
{"text":"convient on the strip. Staff was very friendly. But most importantly, the micheladas were def on POINT. Perfect for the \"day after\" in vegas"}
{"text":"Waitress a total snob!!!!!!

SOME FAKE DARK HAIRED BIZz WITH A MOLE NEAR HER MOUTH!


WHEN ASKED ABOUT A MEAL SHE LITERALLY, SAID \"Well i never tried it so whatever you think is good\"

she made our experience here one to never be repeated again!!!!!

we are never coming back here, 
atmosphere is more like a bar than restaurant.
small, crowded, stuffy.


food was GROSE!


WHO gives a butter knife with an order of carne asada steak??
OH YES, THIS PLACE!!!


I swear I almost knocked over the damn table trying to cut a piece of that rough \"steak\""}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!!! The Bartender whos name i dont recall was awesome. 
Their food is great. the place is a little small but for the location its great will def. be going back to this place. 
One thing i loved it was Sunday and they were playing FOOTBALL which made that place even better."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST ONLY: Stopped by yesterday morning (Monday) just after checking out of our hotel. We had just picked up a few souvenirs at the neighboring Coke and ABC Stores, and quite honestly I wasn't in the mood to eat at a food court or wait a great deal of time for seating/waiting for food. I had seen their breakfast special ($4.99) sign in front and I remembered it on the way back to our parking. 

We stopped in and were seated immediately at 10:30am - it was not overly crowded but about 75% of the tables were occupied by recovering Vegas enthusiasts. The noise level was low to medium, same with the lighting. At 10:35 we had placed our orders. I checked my FB newsfeed and shared a few memes with my best friend, and was able to lovingly gaze at their tequila selection for a few minutes before feeling nauseous/dehydrated again. Luckily our waitress had already brought over my eSprite! By 10:45 we had our plates in front of us. My breakfast quesadilla was good and I would have finished it except for the little fact that my body was only craving water and a green juice! The potatoes were a little tough for me. My best friend finished everything on his plate, he had no complaints whatsoever. All in all, I give this place a 4/5 for an speedy breakfast to get you through your hangover and back on the road."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something, disregard every other review here. This place is great, I have been here over 10x throughout my 3 trips to Vegas. This place has cheap authentic mexican food and I emphasize CHEAP & AUTHENTIC. Cheap as in breakfast starting at 4 bucks. They also have omelettes and huevos rancheros for 8$ with large portions that will FILL YOU UP. Great value, great taste, the other people here are insane. Definitely go here for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Not good food. For my order wrong. I don't mind that because it means I might try something I thoroughly enjoy and would have never known if that mistake hasn't been made. However this was not the case. I had ordered fajitas.. Ended up with enchiladas. Lol I wouldn't have mind but then my food was so gross and bland I couldn't enjoy it at all. Waiter was extremely nice but lacked understanding .

Oh well.. It's on the strip. What are your going to do?"}
{"text":"The first time I came in here I was craving chips & salsa so bad, I remember walking around the corner and the place seemed to be glowing...or maybe it was the huge pinkish purple sign...anyways, I certainly got my fill of chips and salsa and then some. The portions are huge! I had to take the bf here the next time we went down. He mistakenly ordered something on his own and couldn't finish it (I told you so). But the BEST thing about this place is the breakfast! What a deal and it's just the right amount. Every time I head to Vegas this is a place we always stop at. The servers are very friendly and on top of things and the atmosphere is always pleasant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fast and great food on a budget. Look no further, la salsa
cantina is right fit for you. We currently live in Phoenix and i would have to say this is the freshest mexican restaurant i have been to in years. If you get the drink, I
would get the top self Margarita. The quality of the food is hands down
the best in Vegas I have seen."}
{"text":"very good meals

went there twice during my trip to vegas last week

authentic food

nice, nice peole"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, had been waiting to have Mexican food till we found the right spot! Was defiantly happy with our choice! Burritos were fantastic"}
{"text":"Very cheap and tasty food if you're looking for a quick Mexican meal on the Strip in Vegas. We both wanted Mexican, but weren't looking to break the bank on a fancier place. We found this little hole-in-the-wall and it was delicious! Our waiter was very nice and the portions were huge. I had the enchiladas and they were super yummy. I'd definitely come back to try one of the margaritas or bloody mary."}
{"text":"It's just \"OK\".

We were seated very quickly which was Great.
We ordered and got our waters quickly but that's about as good as the service got....

The waiter forgot our order of Chips and Salsa.  Really?  How hard is chips and salsa... especially when they charge you for them?  And it's not like he was busy... he had 2 tables... ours and one other.  It seemed like he was zoned out on something.

Thankfully, he got our orders into the system and the kitchen got our orders out fairly quickly.

Food was ok... a little salty for my taste.... but I was so hungry I chowed down.  

Had the Enchilada Suiza which was good... lots of chunks of chicken and not just cheese so I was happy with that.  The beans were good but the rice was dry so I mixed it with the beans.

I probably will NOT go back to this La Salsa.  It's a chain so I'll find a different one."}
{"text":"I just went to the outdoor bar outside of the Forum Shoppes. The half yard drinks are quite tasty but a little overpriced($25). It's one of the few places that you can get a half yard on the rocks. The biggest problem is they don't give you a discount for returning with your glass."}
{"text":"$3.95 breakfast still exists in VEGAS???? YES IT DOES!  I mean you get two eggs, bacon, has browns and two tortillas to stuff it all in.......what a deal.  The service is fast, the staff is friendly and this is a great way to eat without blowing out your budget."}
{"text":"I love this place its not fast but from my experience its fast enough for hangover breakfast food ( chorizo and eggs awesome !!!)  yeah its a tour spot but don't go expecting a high class dinning experience. Go with the flow your in Vegas so sit down shut up and stop you complaining. 
I will definitely be coming back here again because i know good mexican food and a good Margaretta !!!!"}
{"text":"I had a good margarita here before...I think. When I ordered it this time, it was watered down and very sweet (I had a raspberry flavored margarita). It was also very expensive for that piece of sh*t drink; $8.25 for a 12oz and freakin $22. for a yard long... WHAT A RIP OFF. I will not get one from here again. The bartender was rude too; he took a long time to take our order.

After flippin through the Las Vegas magazines, I found a coupon for a free 16oz margarita at Slots-A-Fun. Maybe that would've been better...or worse; if you've tried that one, let me know."}
{"text":"Five girls were on a trek for some yummy Mexican food. We wandered the Forum Shops for a good 20 minutes trying to find this place. Caesar's needs to do a better job with signage, but that's a whole other review. 

We finally found La Salsa in a corner of the Forum Shops. I thought this would be a fast food-type restaurant, but it was a sit-down joint - complete with steep prices. We were sloshed from our Fat Tuesday drinks so we sauntered in and sat in a booth. We were dismayed that we had to pay $5 for chips and salsa, but we ponied up - you can't have Mexican without the chips! We also ordered the nacho appetizer platter, which was much bigger than we expected. It fed four of us well. We also ordered some buffalo wings, which were pretty average. Maybe it was a mistake to expect good chicken wings in a Mexican place. Good place to satisfy the alcoholic munchies. Just don't look at the prices - you're not at the corner taqueria!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time for drinks and this past Vegas trip for food.  Their carne asada was really good, but I wasn't that hungry so I couldn't even eat half the plate.  Prices are not cheap.  It may look like a mexican fast food place, but it's not.  Drinks were good.  The bartender was really nice.  I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Aww, why all of the bad reviews, my fellow yelpers?  This place isn't so bad, especially if you are hung over, hungry, and half asleep.  This place is perfect for a cheap breakfast to make you feel human again.

Sprinkled along the Vegas strip, I'm sure plenty of La Salsa Cantina's are the equivalent of McDonald's, but with a heartier affair and with better service.  We had 11 in our party and one awesome man named Javier served us all and with such a pleasant smile that after we finished our breakfast of champions and while all the rest of my party gave him good-bye high fives, I extended a little more thank you with a good-bye hug.  He was willing to deal with our rowdy group to make sure we ate well and left with a smile.  Well, we did so thank you!

The food is average, but how can you beat $3.95 for eggs, potatoes, and choice of bacon or sausage?  Of course I skipped the pork, but eggs and potatoes were pretty tasty.  A side of french toast for $2 was a perfect accompaniment.  Not to be forgotten, my double bloody mary (also $2) was pretty damn good too.

I can't be all judgy for a cheap delicious breakfast offered on the Vegas strip.  Looking for a little more morning glam?  Not La Salsa..but if you're looking for what I detailed above, step right up, don't be shy, and ask for Javier!"}
{"text":"I feel like a broken record when reviewing restaurants on the strip in Vegas, but La Salsa is no different, it was way too expensive for the food we got, however food we got was pretty good!  

We went with the pricey Patron margs (at $13/ea). They were tasty, but really just like any other margarita on the rocks you have every had!  We also started with their fresh made guacamole (they don't do it at the table, but instead make new batches every 3 hours). The guac comes with two salsas and a big basket of chips.  I loved the smokey chipotle salsa and the guac was chunky and tasty. The chips could have used some salt! 

For dinner I had the Green Chile Chicken Burrito (with a side of black beans and rice).  It was excellent.  The burrito itself was stuffed with grilled chicken, whole roasted green chiles and a nice red sauce.  It was crisped up on the fry top and served cut in half (made for easy eating).  

The restaurant itself was kind of forgettable as far as look and feel.  Honestly, while in there I told my husband it reminded me of a Margaritaville in an airport!  Huge bar, a few tables.  Also good to now that while it is in the Forum Shops, it is way down on level 1 all the way at the street (kind off to the side) as you are going out towards Joes (it looks like you are leaving and then there it is!). 

Service was attentive and the food was good.  The price was just too steep.  I mean guac, 2 burritos and a 4 margs was like $93!!!! I think it worth 1/2 that, so low marks for inflated prices!"}
{"text":"Good:
chips and salsa
fish tacos
chicken enchilada

Not recommend:
Veggie Burrito - unless you really like that kind of stuff

The discount meal ticket prevents you from choosing things from most of the menu. It only allows for the main dishes, all of which are around $10 or much higher. I really wanted a quesadilla as my main dish but they wouldn't apply it to it since it was considered an appetizer."}
{"text":"The food is just okay; definitely nothing special. The chicken was dry and burnt. However, our waiter was extremely friendly. Will not be back though."}
{"text":"This place sucks with capital S!customer service is bad all bad, we walked out after sitting there for 15 waiting for the waitress to take our order, mind you the place was empty, after asking if we can still order breakfast she said a nope, \"breakfast is till noon\" is 12:10 the place is empty (scratching my head) but ok, she must of seen $$$ on the people who walked in because she didn't even bother to ask us for our order, she just left us there, food is over priced !! This place sucks!!"}
{"text":"GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Went searching for breakfast and ran into this cool little spot.  We were able to be seated right away.  The server was very friendly and attentive to our needs.   The breakfast was delicious!   My friend ordered the Mexican Scramble and it was GREAT.  I ordered steak n eggs and it was also very good.  To top it off, we ordered $3.95 breakfast drinks that were GREAT.  After a good breakfast, I decided I wanted the big tall frozen margarita (with the plastic cup that you can take home).  Not a lot of alcohol, but it was very tasty.  On top of it all, the place has TV's everywhere so its a nice spot to catch the games.  Not sure how lunch / dinner is, but I would definitely go back and try it.  I encourage you to check this place out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed in Caesars. I had no idea the forum shops even went back this far!

I actually stopped in here on my birthday for a margarita and some guacamole with friends. Guac was fantastic, margarita was strong, service was there.

Menu looked standard, food looked standard, place looked like a solid, standard choice for Mexican, but no great shakes."}
{"text":"3 stars for some really good drinks and atmosphere. Food was ok. A cool place to grab a bite while on The Strip. If you want a real mexican place try the Original Lindo Michoacan in East Side. If you're on the strip and want mexican food and good drinks to go with it then go here."}
{"text":"Perfect for a cheap breakfast and love the $5 patron shots!!! Didn't find that anywhere else on the strip!"}
{"text":"saw this place right before exiting the shops at caesars palace and my bf and i decided to give it a shot. We saw the yard and half yard cups people were getting and were interested in what they had. The Bartender was extremely helpful and friendly and recommended their micheladas (which happen to be our favorite drinks EVER!). I told the bartender I liked mine extra spicy and he did JUST that. They were sooo freaking good! We got half yards because they were out of the full yard cups but that was just enough. We also had a small guac and chips appetizer which was really good. Next time I'm in vegas I will pray they have the full yard cups and be taking one to go! ;)"}
{"text":"I wasn't even that excited to try the margarita here, actually.  But when I buy an $18 drink I expect some damn alcohol in it!  What's the point in some nasty, sweet, fruity beverage that's a chore to drink when it doesn't even get you sloshed, which is what I assume is the only purpose behind the drink?"}
{"text":"Great for a quick breakfast, the bloody Mary's are affordale $1.99 for a pint. Dinners are good too the place turns into a club at late night."}
{"text":"In our recent trip to Vegas, we decided to eat at La Salsa -thinking it was as good as the other La Salsa chain restaurants we've been to in California. Nope, we were WRONG.  The cheapest burrito on the menu was about $14 and it had some nasty-ass instant \"uncle Ben's flavored\" rice that was as hard as a rock.  They had no veggie tacos as they do in all the other La Salsa's I've been to and you have to pay for chips and salsa. WTF! Please don't make the same mistake we did, thinking we could have a quick decent burrito. I would recommend going to the Del Taco next door, upstairs in the food court where their burritos are $1.49 and if you don't like their burritos at least you only invested a fraction of the cost.  What a shame that La Salsa can't even keep their quality standards uniform throughout their chains.  On the bright side, if you're drunk and won't remember or care what you're eating, this place will work -but so will eating out of the garbage."}
{"text":"It's the breakfast, folks! I'm with Tarah M. on this one.  I understand that La Salsa is cheap chain and I'm not expecting much if I come in here to eat, especially in one of the shadiest parts of the Strip! Still, the value for the price (at breakfast at least) is reasonable, and I've had nothing but friendly, attentive service with no wait to be seated. 

The three times I've wound up in this location have all been related to emergency trips to the nearby Walgreen's to pick-up forgotten essentials. After blowing a small fortune during the first night of a long Sin City weekend (why does that always seem to happen?), I love knowing that I can come down to La Salsa for a decent $4 eggs-bacon-potatoes breakfast and $2 double Bloody Marys.  They even gave me a fresh full coffee to-go at no extra charge when I asked for a cup to take my last few sips with me.  Nice!

P.S.  The actual salsa is not that great (at least for this Texan), so mix in some Cholula if you want some fire."}
{"text":"The potatoes for breakfast were so crunchy I couldn't penetrate them with my fork :( The AM Bloody Mary's were excellent. I think with so many options in the area, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Was not expecting Mexican food to be this good in vegas! Definitely will eat here the next time were in vegas."}
{"text":"I eat here often, and enjoy the fish tacos and grilled chicken tortilla soup. The food is delicious, but somewhat pricey. They earned the 3 star review because they no longer offer complimentary chips and salsa.  What they do offer is an $8 \"chip/salsa flight\" which consists of 4 salsas in small ramekins - and 2 of the 4 salsas they give out with your entrees at no extra charge.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for regular chips and salsa - it's quite absurd really.  They make plenty of money off their bar beverages, and  I seriously do not think that complimentary chips and salsa would cause them a grave financial hardship."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible, no one greets you at the entrance, waiter was friendly but standing around looking at his phone the whole time. Salsa was awful, guacamole was old and a basic chicken fajita was mediocre. Major waste of time... not sure why this restaurant is still up and running. It seemed tired, dirty and low quality. Hate to be so negative but I'm being fair...trust me."}
{"text":"I was passing by, hungry and find this place , I saw the breakfast menu was great and the service , they was able to change a. Little my enchilada like I request very happy with the service and more the price ."}
{"text":"This place is the best for breakfast, 4.95 specials and very filling. Quick and friendly service. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best deal you will find for breakfast on the south end of the strip. I wish I would have discovered it sooner in our trip. We always got the $3.99 breakfast which consisted of eggs, choice of meat, breakfast potatoes and toast or tortilla. They do upcharge you for more tortillas and also to bring you salsa with the meal. I guess I should have asked. The salsa is very good though and worth the price. This is a very satisfying breakfast and a steal at what they are charging. They also offer $.99 Bloody Mary which I tried and it was pretty good. It is not very big, but what do you expect for $.99? We ate here every morning for the rest of our trip once we realized how good it was and what a great value for the money. You must come here if you are looking to not break the bank and still get a hearty, tasty meal."}
{"text":"La Cantina offers solid food at solid prices. I was there for breakfast (which in Vegas of course includes mimosas) and serving sizes were good as were the prices. The coffee was average restaurant coffee (drinkable). I would happily go back again for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this place for years on every Vegas trip. CHEAP fabulous breakfast and the very good tequila sunrise! Home of the .99 Bloody Mary and 3.99 breakfast. You won't go wrong for this meal deal. There are several locations, the one inside planet Hollywood has a slightly different taste and staff service from our visit. The one we normally goto is next to the coca cola museum and MGM on the strip. Consistent and tasty, always a visit in our book."}
{"text":"just had breakfast and i can tell you it is the best deal in vegas. for 3.95 i got two eggs, ham, potatoes, and warm tortillas, unbelievable. service was great and so is this place. will definitely go back for their tacos....."}
{"text":"Great food. Great margaritas. Great prices. 

FOOD
They had some specials: the steak enchiladas with red sauce ($8) and the chicken enchiladas with green sauce ($8). So we got 'em. And they were muy awesome. I was not expecting the food here to be as good as it was. 

Now we have to go back for their crazy breakfast specials: $5 eggs, bacon, potatoes and tortillas and $1 bloody marys. What?

YARD LONG MARGARITAS
Told our waitress (Rosy D) we had gotten yard long margaritas elsewhere before and they tasted like watered down water with extra shots of water and then blended (with frozen water). She recommended we get their \"better\" yard long (an extra $10) - I'm pretty sure it had Patron - and to get it on the rocks (not blended). She guaranteed it would be good. It was. In fact it was one of the BEST MARGARITAS I've ever had, yard long or not. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one. Warning: it will knock you on your ass. 

We were not expecting this place to be as good as it was. Next time we're back in Vegas we're definitely going back! Thanks Rosy!"}
{"text":"You must try this place ! Loved it, my bartender Rafael was the best and so was jasmine . Prices are fair and drinks are the best . Plus it's right on the side of the valet"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is probably not the best but its pretty decent. The reason we stopped here was becasue it was 10am and we were hungry. The thing that caught our eyes was the $3.49 breakfast and .99 bloody mary's. Our waitress was pretty awesome and so was the host. The food here though is not that great. DO NOT TRY THE .99 BLOODY MARYS!!! Those things are so gross but then again for .99 cents there's not much to expect. The $3.49 breakfast was just ok. The portions were super tiny though. The burritos were just ok as well. Not sure i'll be back but we'll see."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a lunch while at a conference.  the fish tacos were awesome!  Some of the wait staff was great while others were just rude and gave strange looks.  Sitting at the bar with a friend who was personable we had a good time and chatted up the bartender.  She was great, lots of fun and I wish I could remember her name.  She just was sweet!  

Well tip well and enjoy the fish tacos if you get a chance! 

They had indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We bought some show tickets and added was a coupon for 1/2 price entree's to La Salsa. Probably wouldn't have gone there if it weren't for the coupon, but the location was really convenient in relation to the MGM Grand. 

Food was good, but the best part was margaritas by the yard! And it was pretty darn tasty at that. We ate when it was pretty slow, so the server was there often to check on us. Even without the coupon, it was reasonably priced. 

Nothing spectacular, but if your a below average joe like me, sometimes it's nice to eat some Mexican food and get a good buzz on without spending a ton. Oh, and you get to keep the yard glass your marg comes in."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Carne Asada was good. Cheap breakfast that is worth leaving the hotel for."}
{"text":"Me and my sisters spend every other Saturday here and we just can't get enough of it! The scene Is HOT on Saturday and Friday nights, the dance floor gets pretty congested and you'll find yourself booty bumping and grinding with the guy or girl behind you which is not always a good thing especially if they look like a shoe :-/ but you can get some of the best Margarita's in town here and the yard Margarita's are only about 20 bucks!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch before shopping at the Forum in Caesars. The food here is not too expensive and more importantly, it was good. We had the fish tacos and wings and they both were really good. We also ordered the big tube of Margarita which was good and felt never ending to finish.

Overall, if you want something fast without breaking your bank at Vegas, come to this place. The service was good and I would definitely come back here in the future if I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Don't eat here! Our server barely spoke English, had to repeat our order multiple times, and was apathetic/incompetent. Fajitas were completely burnt. The onions and green peppers were black and tasted like char. Shrimp tacos and burritos came out cold. When we sent them back, our server didn't apologize and brought back a small plate with one taco, and had taken the beans/rice off the dish. Thanks? Prices were outrageous for the portions. 21 dollar fajitas came out with four shrimp. The only decent thing was the margaritas and even then, you can find much better on the Strip elsewhere. Hard pass."}
{"text":"Quick service for food at the bar.. didn't try their mile high margaritas.. it was new years, and I had about enough alcohol...had my diet coke..and a pretty bland/dried veggie burrito...

Quick mea.. 15 bucks with tip... cest la vie..can make that up in one roll of the roulette wheel."}
{"text":"In dire need of sustenance after our first night in vegas, we came in during opening for their breakfast special. Can't rememeber the prices. Just that they were cheap. Bloody mary was decent.

Service was quick, if not a bit handsy.

A good place to go if you're staying at the MGM Grand, don't want to stray from the strip, and in need some food quick without having the break the bank."}
{"text":"I stopped by the restaurant inside Planet Hollywood.  Sat at the bar and was ignored for at least 20 minutes and I was starving!!!  Left and found another by MGM,  I was so hungry for Mexican food I decided to stop in hoping my experience would be better.  Wait staff there Ok, food MEDIOCRE!!  I'd never go back, it was a waste of $$$$  DONT DO IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!
Such great food.
I had the seafood buritto with shrimp. It was amazing, great taste and it filled me up.
The service was decent and I had an overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Decided to try La Salsa Cantina after walking past it many times over the past few days.  Service was excellent, but the food wasn't very good, especially for the price.   For just over $30 I had chips and salsa, fried fish tacos with the customary sides of beans and rice, one Modelo draft and the cheaper of their margaritas.  The house salsa wasn't anything special.  The fish was definitely not high quality.  It tasted like cheap whitefish or cod.  The rice was alright, and the black beans were just beans from a can with no spices.  The margarita was very sweet; you could tell it was premixed stuff which was lacking in any real punch of alcohol.  Overall I'd have to say it was the poorest of any Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"This place looks small on the outside, but it's bigger on the inside because they have funky things outside. They have long containers that are a yard long, they were made for drinking, but I prefer having horchata instead inside the containers. They have some burritos like carne asada & other one, but the one that caught my eye was the Grande burrito. Of course, I ordered it to try it out & found out it wasn't really Grande as I expected, it was more of a normal burrito, not Grande at all. I'm giving this place a four because while waiting for my food, the waiter that served me & my friend, he was making jokes which were defiantly funny, plus they have breakfast specials"}
{"text":"BEST NACHOS EVER. That's all I have to say about that! :) I don't know what kind of cheese it was but it was absolutely fantastic - generous portion size too! We all shared, which was unfortunate because I would have liked the goodness all to myself!"}
{"text":"I will say, the Bloody Mary here I had for breakfast was hard to drink... it just wasn't any good.  But the breakfast that I had was really quite good.  I enjoyed it much more thoroughly than the ridiculous excuse for a cheese platter and wanna-be baguette that I bought in \"Paris\" for breakfast the following day that made my stomach very, very, very upset.  Our waitress was decent and evenly handled a woman who did not speak English who was very adamant about wanting what we consider \"over-easy\" eggs.  We were also entertained by a charming English fellow performing card tricks at the tables.  Unobtrusive enough and he left immediately when our food arrived.  Reading the other reviews, I am glad to have skipped the ridiculous foot-long beverage... although to think that it would actually be a good deal in the land of rip-offs, makes one wonder what these folks were thinking to begin with."}
{"text":"They have 3 different locations owned by 3 different owners, all their food is good but the prices at the planet Hollywood miracle mile location is much reasonable and better happy hours with margaritas starting at $3 wow who can bet that ?"}
{"text":"I wish the chips were endless and free. Their salsa also leaves something to be desired. The portions are large and pricey. Nothing amazing for Mexican food here. I had the chicken enchiladas and had some of my friend's sampler platter and it was unremarkable, yet extremely filling. I didn't feel well for up to 30 mins after."}
{"text":"If you want a cheap (good for the price) hang-over breakfast for $3.50 and $1 bloody mary's this is the place. Two locations on the strip, one down near MGM and the other in the Mall near Planet Hollywood.

Good decor, sat fast, staff was friendly.

The breakfast special beats the $15-20 breakfast buffets if you just want something decent and quick and save your money for partying later.

Choice of eggs, hashbrowns, meat, tortilla/toast, etc. Not bad actually. Beats McDs!
Plus the 99cent marys, well, are a 99cent mary. Ask for a double. $2 for a tall vs the short glass. Cant beat it really. Again, bang for the buck.

I'll definitely go here for my quick-fix breakfast to save some dough to just waste later in the day."}
{"text":"Amazing,
I've never tasted Mexican food so fresh and light to my stomach. Service was great food was amazing coffee is amazing 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Everytime Im in Vegas I do go here, because hell there arent very many vegetarian places around and they offer a decent vegetarian burrito. Overall the food is ok at best, and the service is really a shot in the dark. Sometimes the service is good and most times the service sucks. A novel thing about this place is their yard or half yard margaritas, lots of tequila. All in all an ok place, especially if drunk."}
{"text":"I am a big big fan of La Salsa it's always on our list of places to go when we're on the strip.  

I have been to this location before and have had a five star tasting meal with great service at the bar for lunch. Shrimp tacos are my favorite-not sure what happened on this night but it was a let down.

I'm hoping that they reevaluate the dinner time kitchen staff.

I was here yesterday and OMG the food has gone downhill. 

Food was cold and bland. 

The rice was horrible!

The shrimp had NO FLAVOR!

The salsa was like ketchup!

Enchiladas tasted like a frozen cheap meal!

Mango margarita GOOD. I should have gotten a few of these just to get me thru this crappy dinner but they were pricey.  Service was friendly.

You have to pay for chips and salsa!  DEAL BREAKER

Located inside Caesar's Palace next to Valet Parking. 

Get it together! 

Get a new chef and stop charging for chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"We didn't really want to go to La Salsa, but we didn't want to eat any more white people food, and the Asian food on the Strip is pretty much inedible, so we ended up here.  It's basically a really expensive, sit-down, not-as-good version of Real La Salsa.  However, the decor is nice.

I had a chicken quesadilla, which had a ridiculous amount of cheese inside, and the tortilla part was browned and slightly crunchy.  Very odd.  We also had to pay $5 for chips and 4 types of salsa (the \"Salsa Flight\").  Very lame.

Service was terrible.  Perhaps I should've ordered a yard-long margarita.

Also, it's located inside the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, and it's really hard to find.  Just look for the Anthropologie on the directory/map, and then take the spiral escalator down to the first floor.  Otherwise, you'll never find it."}
{"text":"Say hi to my buddy Marco. He is the manager. Tell him David sent you.   I love the steak fajitas with shredded cheese and the floor tortillas.  The shrimp is also very good."}
{"text":"Great food at AFFORDABLE prices. Ate a wonderful breakfast 3 days. $6,95 2 eggs tortillas potatoes n sausage --Great
Stopped for mid sfternoon siesta. Homemade guacamole n chips very good plus queso poblano which was excellent. Either dish is enough for 2
All servers very good, attentive n friendly.
ABSOLUTELY the best value on the Strip."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience for anyone in our party. Before we could even sit down after the hostess dropped our menus on our table - we were approached by someone trying to take our photograph and then turn around and sell us the print. We asked her nicely to leave us alone - we all had cameras and had been capturing our vacation on our own. She would not take NO for an answer and had it not been for the fact that we were starving, we would have just got up and left. 

The food was not appealing in any way. The salsa was not fresh, the meat tasted pre-cooked, then reheated. 

One good thing - we took some great pictures of the huge stripper mounted right outside the main entrance!"}
{"text":"A small little restaurant tucked away in a small corner alley of the Forum Shops, offering Mexican food, a nice place to kick your feet up after walking through Caesar's or the Forum Shops. 

First impression was the Mexican decor was cute, but upon using the bathroom prior to ordering and it was not well kept, old toilet paper all over the floor, not frequently cleaned toilets it appears, zero toilet paper or paper seat covers, that makes me nervous, what's the kitchen like? 

I'm with a group so I'll play nice and just disregard the bathroom. We order food, and Cadillac margaritas. 

The margaritas were really sugary, but I slurped mine down. I ordered fish tacos (so dry and an overcooked strip of Wahoo fish that it was hard to eat, not pleased, the beans in the side were sticky. I've never seen sticky beans, and I have eaten at a hundred Mexican restaurants and lived in Mexico for 3 years), Suiza enchiladas (they said good), and chicken burrito (small and my friend said just okay). 

Service was great, our waitress was very nice. 

I probably will not eat at La Salsa again, I will try somewhere else in the Forum Shops."}

{"text":"My girlfriends and I stumbled upon this place with a groupon deal. Even though the walk was far from the MGM hotel, it was so worth it!! I ordered an enchilada, and it tasted like heaven! The bartender was extremely friendly. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table. I ordered a blended margarita which was the best I ever had. I just remembered I had an awesome experience at this place. I have two more trips to Vegas this year, and will make sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast & Bloody Mary deal!  The potatoes were especially yummy with the fresh, crisp bell pepper & onion."}
{"text":"Go to the patio area, get a 1/2 Yard Margarita (or a yard whatever works for you), sit back and enjoy. 

1/2 Yards are $20, 2 for $30.

This spot on the patio, outside of Caesar's, is perfect for people watching.  And Chuck is a fantastic bartender!  Quick, friendly and full of suggestions and stories.  The bartender that come on after his shift ended (I never got her name), helped us with directions and was very sweet.

Make sure you ask Chuck to make you the rainbow shot!!! :)"}
{"text":"Good literally tasted like it was made from rubber here. Not sure why some people gave this a decent review, but it's one of the worst meals I've had in Vegas thus far."}
{"text":"I'm sure for tourists this place would be okay, but there's better mexican/margarita joints out there. It's touristly convenient yea but i would go somewhere else. 

chips and salsa were good, but how can anyone mess that up..... other than that nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"The food was good, came by here to Lunch with my wife. As soon as we walked in, we were approached and sat down immediately. Service was great and good was delicious."}
{"text":"4 Stars

Stopped by for a snack w/ my gf. We decided to sit outside (at the bar) and ordered the Nachos Fundido w/ 1/2 steak and 1/2 chicken. I had a Coconut ?? Azule (forgot the name) to get a buz going before my first meal of the day....it was really good and hit me hard. 
Sat around and chopped it up w/ Miguel, the man behind the bar....this guy's got some stories!! you should go out of your way to sit at the bar while he's there and talk to him. 
My girl ordered a Pina Colada and that was pretty good too. Nachos came out and I didn't expect much, but they were VERY good! Huge portion too......couldn't finish the whole thing, but we were full for a few hours!
They've got 2 TVs behind the bar, so if you just want to get drinks and watch a football game...this is your spot."}
{"text":"Found this place on google after searching for cheap breakfasts in Las Vegas after spending over $50 for a buffet. The best thing about La Salsa is that the restaurant is in planet Hollywood/miracle mile which has FREE PARKING. $4.95 for potatoes, eggs, two tortillas, and sausage or bacon. $0.99 for a tiny Bloody Mary. 
Everything tasted like a microwaveable breakfast which made the under $5 breakfast equivalent to something you can get at 7-11. Plus tax and tips, it might be more worth to stop by a convenience store on the way home"}
{"text":"Located in the mall area of the hotel. Great atmosphere and decor. The food was very good reasonably priced but took a little while and was it very hot. Margaritas and Cocktails were very good as well"}
{"text":"Food was average. The music was fantastic. If you are looking for a late night Spanish inspired meal I totally recommend this place. Drinks were not to good, had to send them back twice."}
{"text":"Located in the hotel we stayed at for a conference, this little place was good.  Between three of us we tried a bunch of things over a few days and each dish was great.  It was fresh and not overly salty--which is a complaint I have often about Mexican food.  The fresh salsas were nice too. I didn't like that it was buffet style for the salsas, but that's the clean freak in me :)
They did only have two people working for the conference I was there for--so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"NO COVER CHARGE!!!
$5 margaritas on the rocks are delicious,  not cheap with the alcohol.  Probably had about 5 before we left they close at 3 am very good music was just there 10/19/13 amaxing service our waitress even danced with one of our friends after a happy tip! She was awesome. For the food we chose the combination fajitas which were shrimp steak and chicken, very good came with rice beans and guacamole and a side of tortillas.  Paid about 50 for 3 beers our fajitas 5 margaritas! On my margaritas alone was just 25 but well worth it with the environment and atmosphere on the dance floor! 

Point is, STOP BY AND HAVE LOADS OF  FUN!"}
{"text":"Love the Forum at Caesars and after craving some mexican food, I was happy to find La Salsa. We started with a salsa mix of 4 different salsa's-all very good as well as some queso which was piping hot and very delicious. The fish taco's I had were really great. I liked the sauce, the grilled fish with cabbage and huge slices of fresh avocado. My husband had soft taco's, requested on flour tortilla versus corn. Came with three so he got one of each-chicken, carne asada and carnitas. All delicious. It was a lot of food and very tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. The indoor seating is small but we didn't have to wait long. You can sit outside with some misters but wait for the summer months to end."}
{"text":"We had lunch here after shopping at Caesar's.  I had the taco salad with beef and while it tasted OK at the time, I had a severely upset stomach all afternoon!  My wife had no problems with her meal (an avocado and chicken stack) so perhaps it was just bad luck.  The service was bad, the prices were too high, and my wife's $14 margarita was served in a plastic cup.  Meh, no thanks."}
{"text":"Best cheap breakfast on the strip. We stayed at the MGM and it was very close. The mimosa left something to be desired so I'd probably skip that next time but for 4.99, especially in Vegas, it's worth a try! 

Side Note: They will sub egg whites for scrambled eggs for a $1 up charge. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't go there for the food! I am sure it's fine if your main goal is drinking. But I was there with 3 other people, and no one liked their food. The salsa, their name sake, was watery! And you had to pay to get chips & salsa. The chicken was rubbery. Just don't!"}
{"text":"This place is a tourist trap. The prices are moderate, but you get very little poor quality food. I'd rather have eaten at Wendy's next store and saved my money. There is some entertainment in the front, and the waitresses are nice. However, they have slow service."}
{"text":"2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 076/100

This is your average Mexican restaurant. Reminds me of El Torito. Food was as expected, not spectacular but still good. Big portions, great chips and salsa. Customer service was very nice and the margarita's were on special!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and it was delicious. The service is pretty good and the breakfast deal was only $3.49. Bigger portions would be nice though :)"}
{"text":"There are multiple versions of this place (apparently), and this one is tucked into a corner of the Forum Shops.  While the others get roundly negative reviews, this one seems to be good all around - and we had a grand time.

Since it was lunch, they were packed, but we sat at the bar and had good - and speedy - service.  The drinks were decent, and while prices weren't cheap, the food was good, and plentiful.  While it's not authentic, the food is hearty fare, so you can eat up and have plenty to keep you going throughout the day."}
{"text":"Palabra!"}
{"text":"We came here for nachos which were delicious. However the tall margirita was not very strong. I didnt feel any alcohol in it. But id come back for the nachos."}
{"text":"Went here on my Vegas Vacation 2015 and was a great relaxing please to eat. Catalina was our server and she was fun and friendly to me and my buddy. The Top Shelf Nachos with grilled chicken was amazing and glad she recommended it!"}
{"text":"We used a travelzoo voucher and had margaritas with burritos.  The food was not very good.  Mine was too spicy and I usually love spicy food.  It was that level of spice where you can't taste anything but the burning in your mouth.  Service was lackluster.   We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Saw an advertisement for 4.95 breakfast so we decided to check it out. Minimal wait before being sat. Ordered the special with ham scrambled eggs potatoes and flour tortillas. It was very good. The server was very nice and on it. Wow defiantly come back."}
{"text":"There are a few positives about La Salsa.  One is that they have a DJ and a real dance floor; and by real dance floor, I mean that people are expected to actually dance to the music they play, not just grind or stand around holding a drink.  The other positive is that on a Saturday night, they were not charging a cover for guys.

Other than that...we got free chips and salsa for being locals.  Margaritas go from $10 - $17.  We didn't order any food besides the chips, but entrees were priced $15 - $20.  If you're on the strip and want to dance to Latin music, then cool, go to La Salsa.  If you're on the strip and want to get margaritas and get Mexican food...then go somewhere off the strip."}
{"text":"Where can you see two Michael Jacksons and a Superman kick it? The back of La Salsa Cantina. 

I guess we should have known that it was going to be an \"eh\" experience when it took five minutes for someone to come to the podium and seat us...even though the restaurant was half full. The two friends I was with were getting impatient, but finally a hostess came and seated us. 

It took about ten minutes for the waitress to finally come over and take our drink order. But since that took so long, we decided to place our food order as well. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come out, but we ate the chips and salsa to hold our hunger over. 

I ordered the nachos, they were good and filling. Whatever my friends ordered, they didn't really care for. I had to wave down the waitress to get a refill on my soda. 

I understand that the restaurant is located on the strip...they're probably busy all day. It just seemed like they were understaffed or something. And since it's a chain, I highly doubt that it will be going out of business anytime soon. The next time I'm craving Mexican food in LV, I'll probably skip the La Salsa's and choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"Really nice friendly people working here. Got one of the huge drinks you see people walking with all over the strip. It was pricey, $20 but unforgettable! Unless you add more tequila for $1 more ;) we got strawberry and it was delicious. Great way to cool down. Oh btw, you might meet MJ outside of here!"}
{"text":"Come for $5 breakfasts before noon!

If you're at this end if the Strip, You just can't beat the $5 breakfast here. 2 eggs, American potatoes and bacon. Add a bloody for $1 if you're feeling ready for it. I also snagged Coronas for $3 each. Didn't try the margaritas by the yard - which seem to be popular with Strip goers - but they blend them by hand which is a nice alternative to the premade stuff. Wasn't a hug fan of their guacamole, but maybe that's what I get for being a glutton."}
{"text":"The sign at the entrance caught our eye. Not much of a looker from the outside but when you get in, it isn't that bad. Nice Mexican restaurant. For breakfast the $4 meal and 99 cent bloody mary is a great deal, though I advise you step up to the $2 bloody mary, bigger and better. Had dinner here once and loved it, five of us and it came to about $90, not bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"This La Salsa Cantina is the one located on the strip next door to the M&M store across from New York, New York.  It's a great place to catch a quick drink while the kids are next door.  The place has been there for years and still the bartenders still poor a mean drink!  Yummy.  The problem at this location as in the past, is that the smell of vomit permeates the bar area.  You'll know why after having one of their \"Margaritas by the Yard\".  If you don't have a seasoned stomach for the large3 foot funnel tube drinks made here, don't drink one.  Most people who don't drink can't handle one.  Nachos are good here too!"}
{"text":"This was my go to breakfast place for about 8 years.  Every time I'm in Vegas, I go here for their 3.95$ breakfast deal because its inexpensive and delicious. 

 I started running into trouble when I began requesting beans instead of potatoes on my plate.  I'm kind of a health freak and just don't eat greasy breakfast potatoes.  I would ask, and they would say... \"Let me check with the manager\".  Every time, without fail.  They always obliged but it seemed to be a problem.  This morning I went in and sat at the bar.  I asked for scrambled eggs, sausage, and beans instead of potatoes.  I was informed that they would not be able to complete this simple task because the bartender would \"get in trouble\".  I grabbed my shit, and left.  Never to darken their doorstep again.  I was a loyal Cantiner.  Until today.  You don't build business by saying no.  I mean, was it really too much to ask?

P. S. -Adios Manny.  You're too good to be wasting your time there."}
{"text":"One star cuz I can't give a zero.  Ordered chili lime salad.  No chili lime dressing..out but they have ranch.  It isn't a chili lime salad then.  Waiter had big bleach stains all over his black pants and then he waited on all customers with a tooth pick in his mouth.  Gross. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Best buy for breakfast  especially for kids . Fast friendly service 3.99 breakfast good and 99 cent bloody Mary's . We ate breakfast there 3 times . Six people for under 40.00 Can't beat that !"}
{"text":"For a touristy day on the strip, stop here and have a blended cream sickle (21+, of course!) Seriously, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Came here 1/31/16 for some breakfast/lunch ! Wanted some Mexican food. Place was located close to the hotel we we're staying at. Breakfast stop serving at noon as noted on banner. Waitress was friendly and ordered our food quick...

I ordered the Chicken Enchilades with green sauce and rice no beans. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp tacos. The Enchilades were actually pretty good for it not being authentic Mexican food. Rice was actually pretty good not hard like most other non authentic Mexican places. My girlfriends shrimp tacos we're not good. Tasted like Taco Bells tacos and shrimp was just put in the microwave. The Michelada was actually not bad with a Modelo. Guac sauce needed some lime in it. Overall not a bad place. Might be back in an emergency situation for Mexican food. FYI: They charge for chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go for Latin dancing on the strip. I have been here numerous times and it's a blast every time.  The dance floor is always lively and you can see that everyone enjoys themselves when they are there. 

 This is the La Salsa in the Showcase mall right next to the MGM and the M&M factory.  If you want to go out and have a casual time on the strip and not go broke,  make sure to come here.  Staff is always friendly and attentive especially Marco the GM who always knows what's going on and checks up on things.  

The food is always great too.  I recently had the fajita burrito and it was so big that I shared it with my wife and we couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money Mexican on the strip.
The decoration and atmosphere is great (makes you feel like you are around in mexico, not far form the beach), super friendly staff.

4.95 for a breakfast is unbeatable. 0.99c spicy bloody marries are killer.
Good margaritas as well.

Very good hangover cure place for those staying around MGM! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but the prices they charge is a sh*t load of $$$. The atmosphere was HORRIBLE!!! The music they play at night time is just old lame ass music from Pitbull, Daddy Yankee, & other lame ass reggaeton music."}
{"text":"Rubio's, you look pretty good now!  Consider this a strong...1.75 stars.  The service was very good.  

I had fish tacos.  When they arrived I thought it was fish sticks covered in a red sauce.  After I probed it with my fork I realized it was a rectangular portion from some kind of fish fillet.  Done medium well.  Something that should never be done with fish.  The pinto beans were average and the rice was below average with a few crunchy grains mixed in.  

The setting in the Miracle Mile shops is interesting.  Sit outside and people watch and have a couple drinks with your meal and you might enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Sure, they are a chain. Sure, it is not authentic Mexican Food by a long shot. Still it isn't bad. 
I had a Taco Salad which was humongous! I barely finished it all! It tasted good though and fresh. The toppings of salsa, sour cream and guacamole tasted like they were supposed to! Steven's tacos were tasty as well!
The chips and salsa they serve before hand were good too! Sometimes you can be fooled with good chips and salsa and get a meal that is inconsistent and bad but that is not the case here! I have no complaints here."}
{"text":"We wanted something fast in Vegas to eat before our show....so we decided to stop here. There were 11 of us and I personally wasn't a big fan of my meal...I had a chicken burrito..it was just blah...needed more flavor. I did like the queso...good queso!!

A couple of us got the maragaritas and they were fresh and great!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! $14 for a yard margarita on the rocks! It knocked my socks off! The food was amazing and a descent price. Will definitely come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for the Saturday night Latin music. 

Free for locals. Small ass dance floor, but plenty of seating and the music is great. DJ plays a variety of everything, mainly reggaeton, bachata, Cumbia and salsa. Mixed Drinks are $7-$12, shots $4 to $9. And then there's the food. Huge proportions so I recommend a mixed appetizer to share."}
{"text":"While walking on the strip, I wanted a yard margarita.  We stopped here and got a margarita that is a yard long.  I got the mango margarita. It is pricey for what it was worth. It cost $20."}
{"text":"I have no idea if this place is a cookie cutter chain but we stumbled upon it after an afternoon of wandering the strip and all of us were ravishing and in dire need of hydration and nourishment. This place more than hit the spot.

The service was on point, glasses never empty & courteous help all around from the server and other help in the restaurant.

We had their guacamole @ $8/order, it was good. I like a little more kick in it, but I can understand needing to tame it for the masses. It was not made table side and served in a nice presentation glass dish with hot chips and some decent salsa.

I had the fish tacos which came with 3 sauces, a chipotle, ancho chili and avocado crema. All three sauces were really good but I think I liked the chipotle best. 

Pricing was average for eating on the strip, about $25/person with tax and tip and no alcohol. 

I thought this place is worthy of a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Located just south of the MGM, we opted to hit up La Salsa Cantina in hopes of curing our Vegas hangover.  Sadly, this place was nothing but a let down.

I will spare everyone the details and simply suggest that readers \"pass this place by\".

Their awful service is only \"bested\" by their terrible bloody maries.  

If quality and service are of little concern, check out their ridiculously cheap breakfast menu..."}
{"text":"Love this place! I can't believe the bad reviews! Spend my weekend in Vegas and was here both nights for the dancing. I first went to LAX and it was so crowded, nowhere to dance! What's the point? So, we came here and had a BLAST!!! Next night we went to HAZE at Aria, and it was SUCH a disappointment, so we came here, again. It was so much fun! Staff is friendly, people are friendly. We didn't have the food so I can't comment on that, we just came to dance and it was SO MUCH FUN! I was probably the only non-Latin in there but nobody cared! It was a BLAST!!!

P.S. - they had water bottles for a dollar... A DOLLAR!!! This is unheard of at the strip. I was a happy camper since I don't drink!"}
{"text":"Great service . A lot of food with every meal we ordered ! Good guys place for sure ! I would definitely eat here again . The enchiladas suizas were awesome !"}
{"text":"The only reason to even stop when trekking down the sidewalk is for the yard-long margaritas. The bartender that served us was fast, upbeat, and excited (geuinely or not) to have us there. She made a mean margarita on the rocks and it had more tequila than I was expecting from such a touristy hole. In fact, it had quite a lot of cheap tequila. Which, in yard-long quantities, spawns the beginning of an awesome Vegas night. 

Minus one-star for telling us it was $16, then asking us if we wanted on the rocks while failing to tell us that would be an extra $3. Still - get it on the rocks. Trust me."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas strip is filled with a lot of pricey places to eat. It's easy to get lost in the void of expensive gourmet and overpriced mediocre food. If you're really cost conscience you'll eat at the fast food joints like McD's and Sbarro, or maybe stock up on cheap take away from the ABC store.

And then there's the Salsa Cantina. It's a nice little Mexican restaurant with sit down service, pretty good food and decent prices. I found the staff at this one (it's a chain) to be very friendly and efficient. They have plenty of tables and booths for seating and pedestrian traffic doesn't seem that bad. If you don't want to be all shoulder to shoulder eating in a food court tripping over people and their kids, this place is nice to get a booth and somewhat \"privacy\". 

The atmosphere is pretty fun and it's dim with lots of neon lights and has that feel of actually being in Mexico. But your on the Vegas strip. And just so you know, they have a photographer come to your table and take pictures of you. They'll come back with a free postcard photo of you and then offer you a couple of framed photos. $20 for one or $30 for two. We declined, my iPhone took care of that tidbit of memorabilia for us. 

They have a breakfast special of 2 eggs, meat (sausage patty or bacon) home fried potatoes and corn or flour tortillas for $3.95 up until 12 noon. Add a small Bloody Mary for 99¢ or a large for $2. Cheap cheap and very tasty. 

The Lunchtime special offers 2 enchiladas( choose chicken or beef and the beef is not ground beef, but steak), rice and pinto or black beans for $8.95 and $2 coronas. You have a choice of red or green sauce and both are delicious. For happy hour try the 48oz hurricane margarita. If you can't finish it, just take it with you. 

The only thing this place is missing is a mariachi band. But it's a great cost saver while staying on the strip."}
{"text":"We choose to come here after seeing a breakfast sign. Yum! The had the best price on breakfast the entire trip. I can't eat a buffet and feel it was worth it so, this place is my new top choice. 

WAY TO GO ON THE FRENCH TOAST!
 Great job on the hubby's steak burrito!!
Grandma loved the 99 cents bloody Mary's.

Will be back."}
{"text":"Gross gross gross. I don't know why we walked in here. Being drunk should make everything taste better!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. It was quick. I got the grilled fish tacos, I'd do it again.  I don't know if I'd make a special trip here, but if you are in the neighborhood it's not a bad choice.

I will say the margaritas might be worth the trip!  They make the mix in-house and you can tell right away. I had 2!"}
{"text":"A few months back I ate at a random la salsa and had an amazing meal. Like, legitimately excellent (which is saying a lot, since I live in Southern California and used to live in Mexico). That La Salsa was somewhere between fast food and fast casual. I was looking forward to coming to this la salsa (because I really like Mexican food for breakfast), and was kind of surprised that it was an actual restaurant. The prices reflect that change as well. 

Overall, the experience was ok. The food was pretty good (nothing to write home about, but it cheaply and healthfully filled my belly), and the servers were nice enough, but the service wasn't really *good*. It was like a Mexican Dennys. This is totally ok if that's what you're expecting, but disappointing if it's not. Their hostess set up isn't really working. They have the hostesses doing a bunch of other miscellaneous crap around the restaurant and it means that you might wait a long time to be seated. 

I ate a full meal here once on my trip, and stopped in for some snacks to go twice. Their chips and salsa to go is around $2.50ish and they give you a massive amount of chips and salsa. Like I couldn't have gotten that much at the grocery store for that price. Their pinto beans are also delicious."}
{"text":"I want to go back and eat there right now! It was the best meal I ate in Vegas! I ordered nachos with chicken and a chicken quesadilla (Not looking for the healthiest meal). Staff was nice, didn't stand out as amazing, but overall good service. If you are staying at the MGM Grand, it's really close by. After I ad eaten at McDonald's twice, the buffet and ordered a pizza, I just wanted some yummy Mexican food. Thanks for saving my life that day."}
{"text":"Right on the strip! When I went they had MJ impersonators at the enters be who you could see from the bar area & kept us entertained while people watching! The salsa was delicious, food smelled & looked amazing but all we did was drink. 2 for $5 for Corona & I got a margarita on one of those tall crazy cups ! The bartender was nice & accomadating !!! Great day drinking spot"}
{"text":"Can't beat the 99 cent Bloody Mary's in the morning. We had a super bar tender that made ours extra spicy. The mexican breakfast was delicious."}
{"text":"This place in conviently located on the vegas strip near MGM Grand and M&M store They have a pretty tasty 3.99 breakfast (yes 4 dollars on,the strip). Plus they have .99 cent bloody marys and a variety of breakfast cocktails for less then 5 dollars including patron margaritas. If you would like to save a little money and are awake before noon this place will provide a nice breakfast without leaving the strip."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for some good food and friendly service, too bad we were wrong. The restaurant has on the menu, a 48 oz margarita and the waiter kept trying to get me to get the Patron tequila, even after I repeatedly told him I HATE Patron, that was his first mistake, next, the waiter asked us if we wanted chips and salsa, we said yes, he brought them, we get the bill and its a charge for them, he never said they were not complimentary (where I'm from, Chicago, chips and salsa are complimentary), that was his second mistake (he did take them off the bill). To put the icing on the cake, I ordered  flautas, they were made with some of the thickest tortillas I have ever seen in my life, my friend's salad had no dressing, she asked for extra and where was our waiter?, running his mouth with his fellow staff members, it took him 15 minutes to bring a side of salad dressing, which we had to ask him for TWICE. Overall, I was not impressed and I will NOT BE BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"They are so easy-going here that it's easy to say yes when they casually ask if you want your margarita made with Patron. But hey, it's Vegas!

We got the chips and guac, and the guac was most excellent. I got a burrito, which was standard mexican fare. It was good, but not great. The restaurant was also almost a side-note and relatively hard to find in the Forums. They were pretty tiny and the decor left some to be desired.

Service was quick and happy and it's hard to complain about that. I think every single person who worked there came by to check on us while we were sitting there."}
{"text":"What drew us in was the $4 breakfast but we both ended up getting something else. Both items were alright at best! We got the chilequiles con huevos and the California omelette. Two big thumbs down for both. Probably the most bland, unseasoned plate of food I have ever had. Would never come back"}
{"text":"Fanciest.  La Salsa.  EVER!!

Fine dining La Salsa aside... yummy margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"I will never come here while in Vegas. Lesson learned. We were seated quickly and they had funny entertainers. Hence, 2 stars. We got there pretty early for Vegas standards, about 11AM, so they werent busy. The waiter forgot my drink after 10 minutes. I ordered the enchilada and steak taco deal. It was the most boring Mexican food Ive ever had. I had to add soooo much salsa, but it didnt really help."}
{"text":"Nice place good food taquitos de flautas one of the places in Vegas even have live band 3 nice good guys that sing every song you want.."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot to check out if you want something a little less over the top. 
The club scene isn't really my cup of tea, I'm more of a bar hopper and a foodie, so this place was nice to hang out at.  Also, it was conveniently located right by the Excalibur where I was staying so I didn't have to walk too far drunk. Haha.

Anyways, when we got there at around 8:00ish it was pretty empty, but boy did it get packed as the night grew longer. Especially  at around 10:00pm when they clear out the bar stools and a few tables & chairs to make room for the dance floor, because on Friday & Saturday nights they have a DJ. So when that happens, it's crazy packed and everyone is dancing, which I didn't care for. Mehh.

I just stayed at the bar with my bf and watched all the sweaty people dance. Haha. The bartenders were very friendly and kind. They did their job well, I must say. One of them even gave me a shot of tequila on the house because it was my B-Day. Very awesome! 

Mmm so they have very yummy half  yard margaritas that you have to try. I asked our bartender to make it more on the stronger side and he pulled that off very well. Wow, that thing was strong and delish. And you get to keep the thing it comes in as a souvenir. 

Now about the food...
My bf and I shared the steak fajitas, those were so good! They had a very yummy taste to them and they give you a pretty big portion. 
We also came here one morning for breakfast because they have great breakfast deals, and I mean AWESOME deals! Very cheap, yet great quality food. I got the Huevos Rancheros and I was very satisfied!

I totally recommend La Salsa Cantina!"}
{"text":"Went here while traveling across the country on a stop to Vegas.  We had just left the MGM and decided we were hungry late at night and since coming from Ohio, where no Mexican restaurants are open late, we had to go!  Food is very average.  Overpriced and extremely Americanized Mexican food.  I was expecting a little bit more out of La Salsa Cantina but then we found the best part of this place, the yard margarita!

They were charging 17.50 for well tequila and 19 for top shelf tequila, which we chose!  You also get to keep the glass here, which was an added plus!  They don't play around with these drinks and they make them strong, taking care of us for the rest of the night!

I don't know if I'd suggest spending my money on food here, but definitely get the drinks if you do come here, well worth it, especially if you start the night here and get free drinks while gambling after for the rest of the night!"}
{"text":"Allow me to start this review by saying that I hate corporate Mexican food chains.  La Salsa and Baja Fresh both used to have fresh meats and produce, but man have they gone downhill over the last decade.  And Chipotle?  Have you seen the South Park episode entitled Chipotle-away?  That summarizes my sentiments exactly...

The girl and I were hunting the Strip looking for some breakfast at 3pm.  Nothing doing.  The only places that served brunch had waits of approximately an hour... not cool.  So we wandered into Caesar's hoping that Boa might have some unique Vegas brunch menu... denied.  

Beautiful thing is, I can eat Mexican food at any meal.  A quesadilla may not have eggs in it, but meat and cheese and all that good stuff sounds close enough to breakfast for me.  We noticed this small La Salsa situated down the end of a long, nondescript corridor, and figured it was the best that we were going to do before we went at each other's throats out of starvation.

Sat down, service was friendly.  This was by far the nicest La Salsa into which I've ever ventured... it was a proper sit-down restaurant.  Of course, the prices were higher to reflect this, but it was still a relative bargain for a restaurant on the strip.

The girl went for enchiladas, and I opted for the chipotle quesadilla.  Didn't try the enchiladas, but the chipotla quesadilla was fine... chicken, pico de gallo, guacamole, and a chipotle sauce that wasn't the worst I've ever had.  Too much cheese on the quesadilla, which was the same feedback that the girl gave on her enchiladas.  Other than that, all of the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the flavors weren't terrible.

I also ordered a pineapple mojito, which was pretty narsty.  It was a specialty of the house, which meant that it was premade and sitting there in a glass jar so that the pineapple flavor would infuse with the rum... tasted more like a margharita to me, or sweet and sour mix, or something... I hate sweet and sour mix.  It was overpriced too, which chapped me a bit, but hey it's Vegas.

Oh, and the bathroom had bugs in it... gross.

All in all, 2 stars.  The food was palatable if not enjoyable, the mojito was disgusting (but I still drank it for the alcohol content), but the service was fine.   I wouldn't go back, but it served its role in a pinch.  Oh, the one nice thing was that they did have a nice round center bar in the restaurant which had multiple televisions airing college football... a redeeming quality no doubt.  But still, I'll drop my bucks elsewhere."}
{"text":"Skip the food and go straight to the half yard margarita to-go. When in Vegas you HAVE to take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy your alcoholic beverage on the street. They're $17.50-19.50 depending on what you choose, but trust me you are MORE than getting your money's worth.

I prefer mine on the rocks with salt. That way I can see (and be amazed) at how much alcohol they're putting in. And, somewhat less importantly, I find the frozen ones too sweet."}
