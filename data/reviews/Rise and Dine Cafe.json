{"text":"I have only eaten here once.  The staff and servers were very friendly.  It was basic breakfast food but nice to visit and chat with friends.  I plan on returning to try other selections on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and the new owners are fantastic. The Gyro's are unbelievable and BBQ items on Friday's is AWESOME. Chef Frank's BBQ Sauce is unreal a must try. Best food in Chesterland for Breakfast and Lunch."}
{"text":"A nice family place to eat. Food is very tasty, Diner ambience. BIG breakfasts! Kids (under 4) eat free, but, must order from Kids Menu."}
{"text":"The food is great and staff is so nice! This place is under new management, and you can really tell.  Try the gyros!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The perfect post-apple picking spot for city slickers for lunch/brunch in Chesterland.  Massive, diner-type menu, excellent staff and service - but don't fill up on apple fritters before you come here.  This will become part of our apple picking tradition for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast and when I have time lunch. Food is good I don't like grease or salt and I get very little of that. Great owners and the customers are very entertaining. They must be good the place is packed. Thank you for opening up close to my home"}
{"text":"Owners are really good ppl. Best breakfast in town hands down. Steak-n-eggs is bueno! They have great burgers too. Great price on food. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is the Cheers of breakfast joints. Gina, Valerie, and the rest of the waitresses are attentive and friendly! The food comes out hot and delicious.  For a special treat get the Godfather with Guido's sausage patties.. Friday night Broasted chicken is great. The Monday hamburger special with fries is only $3.99  then add the Bigboy sauce for.50 . Better and bigger than 5 Guys . Try it you'll like it.....   Bob"}
{"text":"This place rocks...great food great people...makes ya want to come back for more"}
{"text":"Great coffee, good food, good service! No real complaints here! On busy days you wait a little bit for your food but it is most definitely worth the wait. The potato pancakes are delicious and they have a lot of very creative breakfast choices. Have been here three times and will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Cincinnati and ate breakfast here after Mass.  They were busy yet very accommodating in seating us - a party of 7 adults and 8 children ages 9 and under!  The service was incredible!  It seemed that, with our being a large crowd, any employee that had a minute would come by to see if we needed anything, filled coffee cups, brought extra napkins, etc.  The children were served first and were occupied with crayons/puzzles prior to and after eating.  I believe it was the owner who came out to check on everything and offered all of the children a balloon - which they loved.  The menu is vast and our food was very good. Again, the servers were wonderful, friendly and cheery."}
{"text":"Good food and nostalgic atmosphere.  This place reminds me of a pre-Starbuck's coffee shop.  I went there  middle of the week, 9am and it was very busy.  I had to wait 5 or 6 minutes for a seat and when I finally got one, they sat my fat can at a 2 foot wide table in the isle.  I felt like I needed an industrial size shoe horn to seat myself.  I love the menu selections: steak and eggs, corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito, things like that and most items were $8 - $10.  I got biscuits and gravy- $8.99.  It took about half an hour to arrive.  I think they were unexpectedly busy for the week day, but it gave me some time to watch the plates come out.  These were large, attractive portions.  The toast wasn't Schwebel's and the sausage wasn't Jimmy Dean's.  They have their own thing going on.  Huge onion rings and tall sandwiches.  Waffles that take up a dinner plate.  My biscuits were the size of softballs, cut in half and grilled.  The gravy came in a small crock.  It had large pieces of very tender sausage.  I hate getting pieces of bone or gristle in ground meats. No problem with that here.  The sausage was soft and had black pepper flavor.  The eggs were beautiful.  They could have been used on a tv commercial.  But they were a little stiff and not over easy like I ordered them- more like over medium.  A couple of weird things-  while I was waiting for my food, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke like people were smoking in the restaurant .  I'm old enough to remember when it was legal and common.  Half of me found it very reminiscent, but the other half of me was like -Call the smoking police!  Arrest the Air Burglar!   The smoke cleared after about 5 minutes and my food came. Since I was in kind of a made up table row, there was only about 3 feet between the bar seats and me. A guy that weighed about 400 pounds decided to stop right by my table to talk for about 5 minutes with an employee behind the bar.  There was not enough room for him there.  I literally could not hold my fork at an angle as it would poke him in the rear- and I would be needing a clean fork.  It was very gross. So with his rather large posterior inches away from my food, I couldn't eat.  At the risk of sounding crude, (and I'm sorry for the horrible images this will bring,)  all I could do is think about, -if this guy lets one go, he's going to blow my biscuits across the room!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the biscuits & sausage gravy.  Once in a while I order this and I'm told that they're out of gravy.  Their Manners \"Big Boy\" clone sandwich from days gone by is killer.  service can be from spotty to excellent, depending on how crowded and which server you get."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 4 years.  Yesterday a friend and I stopped in.  We ordered breakfast.  The waitress brought our food in about the normal amount of time, but my friend:s toast was burnt black.  Even the old trick of turning the burnt side down wouldn't have worked.   The young waitress immediately became defensive and made excuses about the toaster.  It seemed the toaster  does this often.  I thought maybe its time to get it fixed and offer something else to the customer.   Waitress also discussed her big tip with another waitress while our coffee was empty and had a minor attitude about rewriting and making separate checks.  Maybe ask first?!    All in all the place does much better with my family on a busy Sunday morning with the more experience waitresses.  However,   I think its time for us to move on.  The management has not trained the newer staff adequately and it made for a less than enjoyable experience. The young man that buses the tables was very polite."}
{"text":"I ordered corned beef hash today.i asked the server first if it was home made and she assurd me it was I  first tried it and it was like eating crumbled ground up left overs.i think i found afew specks corned beef but not sure.the potatoes i assume white specs also. No taste dry .server was nice.  How can you serve such garbage. Felt like it was left over scraps on bottom of pot scraped off. I have ordered this many a times usually woth onions green pepper this order had nothing.if you had to determine food costs couldnt be more then .25cents.what a ripp"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!! Had the cornhash, and it was phenom. Service was great and they were all super friendly."}
{"text":"I have to agree I ordered corned beef ash.would have been better if it was out of can I bet I would have a better chance of eating corned beef"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Fast and friendly servers. Diner environment. Great place to stop in and get a quick meal! Everyone that's local knows about rise & dine cafe and loves it! They have these Mickey pancakes for kids! They are adorable! And they give kids balloons! Very family friendly! The breakfast bowl is amazing! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sister and I stopped in for a quick breakfast. Service was good and quick without feeling like we were rushed. Our waitress was friendly. Menu had lots of breakfast choices and they allowed substitutions when we asked."}
{"text":"I heard that this place was under new management so I decided to check it out. What an improvement!  I was impressed with the appearance of the restaurant.   What was previously a \"rodeo\" style has been replaced with clean white walls and local high school football jerseys.  The restaurant has also expanded.   As I ordered I was asked it I wanted hash browns or home fries.  This was very exciting! Who doesn't love options.  I got the breakfast special.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the home fries were delicious.  I find many breakfast places to leave me feeling greasy.  But I felt great after eating here.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast 5-6 times now, and it's always been perfectly cooked, delicious, quick, and well-priced. Great small-town diner atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. I always get the green eggs and ham and I am never disappointed. I would eat them in a house, i would eat them with a mouse, I would eat them in a box, i would eat them with a fox, i would eat them here or there, i would eat them anywhere. Seriously,  try the green eggs and ham!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, great staff the food is always good. The owners are always pleasant. Sunday morning breakfast after church has become our tradition."}
{"text":"Stopped in for b-fast.  We loved it. Diner style. Clean. Nice people. Good eggs/toast/bacon/hash browns"}
{"text":"Really great food. Must try corned beef omlet. Wish they were open all day and night"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on our way back to Detroit, trying to avoid construction detours and ended up here. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my girlfriend ordered some sort of eggs on potato pancakes dish.   I noticed one of the specials was more then regularly priced on the menu that day.   The waitress asked \"how I wanted my eggs?\",  um poached right?, otherwise it wouldn't be Eggs Benedict. My gf's food got spilled on the way to the table and half ended up on the floor, she got the other half with an \"whoops, you want this or should we make it over again?\"  Accidents happen, sure, and they quickly replaced the other half , but the place didn't even seem busy, and we never got any coffee refills until I had to ask one of the owners if she could fill me up.   The waitress needs some training on proper etiquette, she also needs to slow down and pay closer attention to the coffee, which by the way, despite what the sign that  reads being the best in town, it's way too weak and watery.   The food was pretty good, A+ to the cooks."}
{"text":"It's been almost one week since the new owners opened the doors.  Wanted to give them some time before we stopped in.  So...eight of us stopped in late Sunday morning.  With a busy restaurant, we received great service and wonderful food.  I had the Philly cheese-steak and home fries.  Delicious.  Others in my group had breakfast and lunch meals.  Everyone had a good time and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  Menu is huge, food is awesome, servers are great.   So happy to have this place right around the corner.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Dreaming about their country fried steak right now salivating."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of a hometown diner. Quick, easy, happy servers, and food that tastes like your mom made it. I have only ever ordered takeout from here, but I have been the one to pick up. The inside is very homely also, nothing too extravagant. I feel as though I can tell they actually care about making people happy, because even the takeout  is well packaged.   They have some sort of iPad paying system, which confused me at first when I was trying to tip. It was like.. WHAM BAM lost my chance to tip. This can be awkward for people like me who don't carry cash."}
{"text":"Hungry after days on the road, I settle in for a quick diner meal. Checking the reviews locally, I decide to try to dash on to Rise and Shine.      I wish they shone. They have a good grill cook, my food was greasy spoon perfect and out in no time. A breakfast bowl of hash browns, eggs, bacon, and gravy is a fine meal all day long. The service, though, was lacking. I don't know if my waitress was just having a long day or what, but she definitely didn't seem in the mood for service.      The place was packed, and the good food and reasonable prices would get me back in, just hopefully with another server.      After consideration, the chef deserved the 4th star."}
{"text":"Rise and Dine is your quintessential greasy spoon diner with an excellent staff, clean eating area and awesome food choices. I had the manner's burger with the special sauce and it was amazing. I can't wait to go back and have it again. My dining companion had breakfast and he loved it as well. Definitely give this place a try, you'll be very happy you did."}
{"text":"I went to lunch today at noon. I had a scrumptous Black & Bleu Burger with Taters. The burger was medium well. It was hand-crafted and juicy. The taters were crispy, golden brown. Our waitress was very attentive and refilled promptly when neccessary :)"}
{"text":"Great place.  So much food, such little priced.  We had Reuben sandwiches and they were loaded with fresh corned beef. We could've split one sandwich. It's nice to see a small town diner do well. We used to go there when it was Elliot's."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place off of a recommendation.  I am glad we did. We ordered 2 hotcakes with sausage links. The hotcakes were light and fluffy and had great flavor. The sausage links were cooked to perfection. We also ordered the Breakfast Bowl with ham and added peppers and onions. The bowl starts with a scrambled egg which is then topped with a layer of homefries, a slice of ham then slathered in what tastes like a homemade sausage gravy. If it is not homemade, I am very impressed with whoever doctors the can. The sausage gravy had great flavor and it stole the show in this dish. My biggest complaint would be that my peppers were not as sauteed as I would have liked. Overall this is a great diner to sit back and enjoy breakfast. Sabrina was our waitress. She was very friendly and was more than accomodating when we made requests. A nice touch was when the owner/cook came around to each table to see how everything was. Attention to detail is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"Cute place. The food is A-OK. The prices are great! You can get breakfast for less than $5; so that's pretty nice. We tried their daily special, the chicken and dumplings plate, the dumplings were completely tasteless; the sauce needed more flavor.  But the rest of it was decent.  The staff is real nice; they all 'honey, sweetheart' with you. Very casual and very friendly."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I come here.  My aunt and uncle live in Novelty, and I eat here almost every time I visit. The burgers are awesome!!! If you're a breakfast person you'll be in heaven. The service is friendly, portions are generous, and the prices are good. Be prepared to wait for a seat if you go too late on a weekend morning."}
