{"text":"Recently surrounded itself with bubble tea advertising. Teas are made at front of store with powder and syrup. Even the teas are not real teas. Just stick with noodle soup and leave the fake teas alone. Tasted horrible"}
{"text":"Come here and eat. Their Benton rice is much better than their noodle soup. Best Taiwan Benton in my opinion at a reasonable price. Better than tai ping xiang (metro)"}
{"text":"We came here to try the soup noodles.  We ordered the ribs hand shaved noodles.  This is not what we got.  No ribs at all, it was a bowl of noodles with a fried piece of pork on the side.  Not what I was expecting at all.  I was expecting braised riblets in the bowl of noodles.  Very misleading.  I don't think I will return. Soya milk  was sour too."}
{"text":"This is a new place that took over Markham Delight.. I really missed that general tao. If anyone knows of a good place for that dish please PM me! 

I got the minced pork during lunch, it was packed up and ready to go quite quickly. 

I've had the Taiwanese minced pork before at a few places in the GTA and this place was above average! I liked that it was chunks of pork and a lot of places use ground pork. There's green beans, egg, tofu, seaweed and tea included! 

Not too salty, I'm into that and the portion size is reasonable. I didn't finish it! I would for sure come back and try different dishes at this place. 

For under $8, the value is great. The lady serving me was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Huge fan of their pig blood, pig intestines and beef balls. They can also place a bit of nice spicy curry sauce into your soup too! Also, it comes with a bit of lettuce - so don't waste an add-on on that! 

This is a Hong Kong styled noodle dish - tastes very much like the real thing!"}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles are pretty good. Not salty. Serving is big and food is made fast.

Comes with free soy milk. Definitely a must-try.

{"text":"I can't speak for the noodle soup as we didn't order food from here. But after a recommendation from someone sitting beside us in the First Markham Place food court, I decided to try the bubble tea. 

In a food court with at least 5 different options for bubble tea, each place is trying to set themselves apart from the other. Noodle Soup sells large sized bubble tea or milk tea with tapioca for $1.99. It is decent quality for the price. I still prefer the consistency and stronger flavours of bubble tea from some of the bigger chains like Chatime or Tea Shop 168 or Ten Rens, but it will do in a pinch. 

The offer is only for flavoured bubble tea or milk tea flavours. If you order taro sherbet, the price is $3.99 or higher depending on the size you order. I did enjoy the creamy powdered taro-flavoured blended ice drink as it was thick and rich in flavour and the tapioca was relatively firm and chewy (although seemingly slightly smaller in size). I just wish the taro sherbet was offered for the same special low price as the simpler bubble teas."}
{"text":"My husband really likes this noodle place. He's a vegetarian and he really enjoys the tofu rice. I really like the noodles too. They are handmade and very fresh!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the braised beef noodle with long noodles.  We usually opt for extra noodles and meat and share.

The drink you get for free is sugar cane juice but really watered down.  Besides that, I really like the noodles here."}
{"text":"I ordered a knife shaved soup noodle with a chicken leg.  The noodle had a chewiness, and it was obviously freshly made.  The noodle broth was delicious.  Somehow I thought the chicken leg would be a marinated one.  Nope, it was deep fried.  Maybe it was not my lucky day.  The leg itself tasted dried and dated.  If the leg was fresher, it would have been delicious, because the crusty skin was packed with devious flavours."}
{"text":"Noodle Soup is the newest food stall in the First Markham Place food court, and is also known as Tian Hao Yun.

Noodle Soup serves lanzhou hand pulled noodles, another thing that was lacking in the food court. They have the ramen styled noodle, as well as the knife (Shanxi) noodle that's quite common in many noodle restaurants (e.g: Magic Noodle). They pre-make, shave, and pull the noodles beforehand, so you won't hear the table slamming procedures in here unless they run out of noodles.

I had the braised beef noodle soup, which came with a small iced milk bubble tea. The noodles were actually very good, and are about the quality you get in Magic Noodle et al. The braised beef was okay, however the broth was quite oily. As for the bubble tea, take it for what it is since it came with it, as it's certainly no Chatime, Presotea, etc.

I'm starting to really like the increased diversity of foods available in the food court, and Noodle Soup is definitely a good addition to the lot."}
{"text":"I came after work on Thursday and it wasn't that great.

I ordered the braised beed noodles. The noodles weren't cooked through so it was raw. I brought the noodles back and the lady was nice about it and asked  the kitchen to replace them for me. Yeah, the second time the noodles were simply mush. The soup base was watered down and lacked the correct seasonings. I wonder if it's because it was so late at night so they ran out of soup? It's also weird how the chili oil wasn't spicy nor hot either? 

I probably wouldn't be back since there's just way too many choices at fmp."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in the FMP food court.

I have tried several things on the menu (hand pulled noodles, knife shaved noodles); the best is definitely the lion's head (meatball) with hand pulled noodles. They also have a bunch of condiments on the side including a delicious sesame chili oil.

I prefer the hand-pulled noodles as all the noodles are cooked consistently as opposed to the knife shaved noodles, as they are all different sizes and thickness, some pieces are overcooked compared to others.

All noodles come with a soy sauce marinated boiled egg, a few pieces of greens and soya milk.

Though the price is slightly above average for food court (~$8-9 after tax), you do get a portion large enough to fill you up; I'd say its one of the better options, perfect for a cold fall day!

The only downside is that this place is new and they need to work on being more efficient; as I had to wait ~15mins for my noodles to be made on a weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"I drop in for takeout almost once a week for their rice and chicken or rice and minced pork combo. The portion is generous so you can make 2 meals out of 1. It also comes with a cold tea."}
{"text":"Noodle Soup, I do love my noodle soup.

I love that there are so many different choices from this little shop in the FMP food court. The hard part is properly decide on what to get?? If you are not a noodle fan, there are bento rice box to choose from too.

During lunch rush, this is one of the most popular stalls in FMP so it will take awhile for the food to get ready 15 min+. 

Worth trying as this is one of the better options in the food court!"}
