{"text":"The tiny dining room was filled when we arrived early. The bar was fully stocked and offered a variety of beers, mostly domestic and a few local craft brews.  The wait staff was professional and efficient.  Started with the bisque that was good , though I would have preferred it to be served warmer. Tried the bistro steak that was cooked medium as requested with the mashed red potatoes. The bistro sauce was delicious though it was quickly made scarce after a few bites. My wife had the chicken Parmesan, stated as not the best ever, certainly tasty. The sauce was the highlight of that dish.  The crowd was thinning out by 8:30.  Overall great food and service for a great price. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Will never come back again!! Food was terrible! The homemade Italian dressing was like sugar water. The chicken Romano had gristle all thru it and there was no lemon in the sauce. It was just melted butter. They asked me if it was ok cause i didn't eat any of it and i said no. Check came and they charged me the full price! $63 meal. They refused to refund me because they said there was \"nothing wrong with it\". I don't know what kind of business practice that is?!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a gem. The food is delicious and the servers are very attentive. Nice place to go with a family or for a low key date night."}
{"text":"Today we had the worst service EVER! Always a love coming here and getting wedding soup but it's was gross today. We also got chicken and waffles and the waffle was over cooked! They didn't put bacon on my bacon on my All America Grill-cheese and when I said the waitress Ashley about it she got  mean about it and also rolled her eyes. Never ones asked if we need our drinks refilled. We never tip less than 20% on a bill. Today the waitress didn't get the 20% but she got a tip. Well we sitting in at our table we could hear standing be hide the bar bitching about how much we left her for a tip to the kitchen staff that was sitting in the bar area!"}
{"text":"We had a a birthday breakfast for my mother at Ladles. The breakfast menu was phenomenal and there was something for everyone and our group ranged in age from 86 to 11!  We were given the area upstairs for our group and the staff worked together to make sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're looking for a soup and a sandwich but the dinners are likely to leave you disappointed. I ordered the prime rib medium rare. What I got was a piece of meat that was so thin that it would be impossible to prepare medium rare. The waitress asked if everything was prepared to our liking and when I told her about the meat she told me that that was all that was left. No compensation was offered. Baked potato was hard. Paid $22 what felt likeca $14 meal. Dining room is loud and cramped. Chef prices for line cook meals."}
{"text":"Been to Ladles several times.  Went on Saturday for dinner and the prices seem to have doubled.  Not worth it, won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a third try.  Sorry to say we were disappointed, again.  Went for dinner this past Friday.  The restaurant was mildly busy, but not so much so that we should have had to wait so long to even be acknowledged for seating.  Finally, after being sat, we ordered soup and a sandwich each.  The waitress asked if we wanted to have our soup with our sandwiches or beforehand.  We both said with our sandwiches.  Soup was brought first, err.  Soup was meh.  For a place called LADLES you would expect the soup to blow you away.  I had the crab bisque and my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken soup.  Both soups were overly salty and not much else as far as flavor goes.  Next, after waiting about 45 mins,the sandwiches were brought out. Mine was not what i ordered. So, they had to fix that.  By the time my correct sandwich came out, my boyfriend was done eating.  My sandwich was the Irishman.  So disappointing as in the past at least my portions had been larger.  Almost every menu item is usually enough for two dinners.  However, this was one thin, lunchmeat sized slice of corned beef and cheese.  Sad.  I asked our server if this was the correct portion size and she said yes.  No, offer to comp anything for the mix up and the wait after we voiced our displeasure.  Customer service and kitchen needs work.  Save your money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I go here almost every weekend for breakfast and every once and awhile for dinner. They have a great breakfast selection and their pancakes and waffles are the best around! The pancakes are light fluffy and full of flavor! The sandwiches I've had for lunch and the food I've gotten for dinner are just as good. Their fried green tomatoes are so yummy and I'm not really a fan of tomatoes."}
{"text":"Great blueberry pancakes... Real maple syrup. The corned beef hash was not as impressive. While homemade and imported from Ireland, the corn beef is sliced and thin...and doesn't hold up to the potatoes. Nice people and looks like an impressive lunch menu."}
{"text":"I was very happy to get away from the chains at the local mall and find this place.  It was recommended by a local and delivered all I hoped for: good quality food, nice sized portions, and fast service.  The chili was decent, salad was fresh (try the chunky blue cheese dressing) and salmon was very tasty.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I will start this review by saying I never post a negative review because everyone can have a bad day now and then. However with that being said after much thought I feel I need to address our experience we had during our first and last visit to Ladles. My husband and I have been looking forward to this restaurant for a while and last evening had the opportunity to. When we arrived we were excited to see the place was full and we had to be seated upstairs, which we had No problem with. Our waitress was very attentive and took our drink and appetizer order promptly. When our drinks arrived we placed our dinner orders. We enjoy our fried greed tomatoes and our side salads before our pasta arrived, here is where things went bad. My ravioli looked beautiful and I tried the sauce with a bite of one on my shrimp and was very excited for my meal. Then I tried my sausage ravioli and the pasta was not cooked at all. I looked at my husband and said this is horrible and gave him a bite and he agreed with me immediately. I can't remember the last time I sent back a meal but there was no way I could eat this. so I waited to see our server to address the problem. After a bit of time passed I had tried some on my husbands pasta and he was just almost finished when our server arrived after I had asked another server to get her. When I explained the issue she was very apologetic and asked if she could get me anything else, which I declined but did order another drink. She said she would have the manager adjust our bill. When our bill arrived there was still the $25 charge for my dinner which I sent back. Our server returned and we addressed the issue and she again went back to the manager. When she returned we were told since I ate my salad and one shrimp and didn't get charged for my second drink that was why the charge was still in the bill! WOW a bite of one shrimp, small dinner salad and a beer $25! And we were supposed to be happy. We said no we would pay for the salad and beer but not the dinner! The manager never attempted to address us in person and we didn't think we needed to ask to see him/her. We paid our bill and tipped our server and left without any management concerned with our issues. This was truly the worst service from management I have ever experienced! We will not be returning and I am sure that will not have any affect however if you do choose to visit I hope everything goes well because they do not care if your experience is good or as in our case horrible!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a month and am always pleased with my selection- breakfast, lunch, or dinner! for breakfast I highly recommend the chicken and waffles - it is served with a spicy syrup that I've never had anywhere else! for lunch, the beans and greens soup with any of their delicious sandwiches! I also want to give credit to their whole wings. you can get whole wings all over the AK-Valley but none taste like Ladles'. what sets them apart is the hint of sweetness (sugar?) in the seasoning and on Wednesdays they are $.50 a piece. Aside from the food the service is always great. the bartenders are very friendly and the servers are very knowledgable of the menu and have never steered me wrong."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  The interior feels like you've stepped into someone's home, the service was great, the juice was fresh and the food was delish.  Excellent menu choices and variety.  I had the french  toast with bananas and whipped cream (which was excellent) and my husband had pancakes of which he said, and I quote, \"I'm going to dream about these pancakes!\"  Bacon was thick and cooked perfectly.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Menu has so many things that look amazing that it's difficult to pick. Their marinara sauce and their meatballs are delicious. The sandwiches are large. The kid meals were also really large portions. The environment is nice, very cozy antique feeling. From outside the place looks like a 'hole in the wall'. Amazing how some of the best made from scratch places are like that."}
{"text":"This is a great joint for soup!  They typically have 5 or more to choose from and they are all homemade.  One of the best options is the unlimited soup and salad.  You can mix different kinds of soups unless it is the crab bisque and there is a $1 upcharge.  It does have the old fashioned homey feel, like you are at grandma's but they do have nice additional seating outside on the back porch and upstairs.  The  dinner salads are priced reasonably and they have an option to get a smaller sized portion as well.  My only suggestions would be to make a note on the menu that certain soups cost a little more, ie. crab bisque.  The first time I went and got my bill and there were two upcharges that I wasn't informed of.  One was for the crab bisque and one was for cheese or dressing.  I am okay with the price difference but it should always be transparent to the customer what they are paying before they order it.  It doesn't bode well when you get your bill and you have already eaten."}
{"text":"I have always had nice experiences here (for breakfast).  The staff is very friendly and there is a cozy, homey feel.  The service and prompt and even at the busiest times, food comes out quickly and hot.  I like the fact that you can get a bloody Mary with breakfast and also that Syrian bread is an option.  (If you are in the Valley area alot of places have Syrian bread, just ask, you won't regret it)  Of course, i got the corned beef and eggs.  My go-to.  It was good, simple and good.  I think it would have been better if I had added peppers and onions, but you have to ask and I totally forgot.  Don't forget to listen to the specials, that is where the hidden gems are, like banana fosters pancakes."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Fish sandwich (Haddock) was tasty with good mayo based coleslaw. Very friendly and attentive service. Quick delivery. Mancini breads. Good beer selection. Very excited to try their other menu items, of which there is a wide variety."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast at recommendations of a family member. Ample off street parking with a large lot. Restaurant is cozy with a back patio available for good weather days. Our server was pleasant and attentive. All was looking well and then we ordered the food...  I order 2 eggs over medium with sausage and potatoes. My hubby ordered eggs with the house hash. We both ordered coffee. I was not a fan of the coffee. Not sure if it was just the brand they use or it was a bit on the weak side, but it tasted off. My eggs were rather small. They look like they used medium size eggs rather than large. Maybe trying to save a buck, but if I go out to a restaurant I want decent size eggs please! They were also cooked over hard not medium like their size. I guess they got that confused. The toast came with no butter and we were offered none. The sausage was not good at all. It was way too thin and burnt! It was difficult to cut, let alone chew. Not a fan. Now the potatoes were excellent! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. In fact they were about them only thing I enjoyed. My hubby's eggs were cooked as ordered and he like the hash. Overall, we may try this place again, but with so many other places around it may not happen anytime too soon."}
{"text":"Great food.  Consistently delicious soups and fresh entree's.  Service is very attentive too!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. The service was fast and friendly, and the food was fantastic. Had the Ladles Country Supreme breakfast. The pancakes were the best I've had in quite some time. The home fries were seasoned well and cooked perfectly, as were my over medium eggs and bacon. The coffee was great and my cup never went empty without me ever having to ask for a warm up.   This was my third visit and the food has been consistently good each time. Great service and great food, can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Saturday. It was a after twelve and they were gracious enough to allow us to serve us breakfast. The breakfast was delicious and reasonably priced. The waitstaff was attentive. She gave us the history of the restaurant which we found to be quite interesting. On the way out we grabbed some homemade cookies for the road. They were delicious. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star it was a bit dark I had to use my flashlight to read the menu."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Ladles in Springdale. My parents have been there before and enjoyed it - so they wanted to take me. So when we were in that part of town, my mom and I hit up Ladles for lunch.   FYI: They serve breakfast until 2pm the weekends - but we got the restaurant at 2:05pm - just in time for the beginning of lunch. I was surprised how busy it was for Saturday afternoon - mostly all of the tables in the main dining room were filled. Luckily, a table just opened up, so we had just had to wait a few minutes while they cleaned it off. The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.   To start, I ordered a cup of the wedding soup. Ladles is known for their variety of soups, so they have a lot to choose from. Wedding soup is one of my favorite soups, so I wanted to try theirs. I enjoyed the soup and would definitely get it again.   For my main entree, I originally ordered the Chicken Parm Sandwich, but ended up switching to the Chicken Parm entree. The sandwich comes with fries or a potato pancake where as the entree comes with a side of spaghetti and dinner rolls. The  entree came with two generous pieces of chicken and a decent side of spaghetti. My only complaint about the chicken parmigiana entree was that the tomato sauce had a ton of large cut up onions in it - they hadn't puréed the onions in the sauce.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Ladles and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I work not too far from here and for the lack of decent, non fast food places around, you'd think this place would be booming. It's not. I've been here and had \"decent\" food - not great but ok. But in the heart of the lunch hour, the two of us were the only ones in the place. I've driven by dozens of times at lunch and see no cars in their lot. I'm struggling to figure out why since it's in \"downtown\" Springdale. You'd think that by default they'd get people who \"stumbled\" in. The menu is basic, the service was ok, the food tasted no worse than other places I've been, but I just can't bring myself to go back. It's one of those places that gave me an odd feeling. That's not what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, since I was in the area. They were down a staff waitress but still killed it! I will definitely be back! Great food, awesome menu and a full bar! Love!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Huge menu and everything is amazing, especially the rolls, salad dressing and jack Daniels chicken salad"}
{"text":"Cozy dining, great plus for the area, friendly wait staff , ample food selections and treats. Seating options are available in the main dining area, outdoors or at the bar. I am planning to go back again soon to try another selection."}
{"text":"I personally think this is the best breakfast spot in Pittsburgh. Come golf season I'm here at least 2 times a week!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Our first time visiting. The menu was impressive and featured homemade entrees. My husband is sometimes hard to please. He ordered the haddock with crab cake, he kept on saying how wonderful it was. My son and I ordered the salmon on spinach, topped with gorgonzola.  They both ordered dessert. Tiramisu and snowball cake. Unfortunately I've been low carb for a month. Lol. The thing about this place that I was most impressed with was the staff. Our waitress was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly, all of the characteristics of a great employee. I also noticed the table next to us had a waitress just as impressive. We will be back and I'm singing praises of this establishment!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We just discovered it a few months ago. Great soup and sandwiches! And if you follow their Facebook page they list their soups on there daily.  Meatball vegetable, greens n beans, and wedding soup are so good. I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is quaint and has an outdated but upscale and welcoming vibe to it. They were accommodating to food allergies specifically dairy. Because it is a small save it can get loud quick."}
{"text":"Grossly disappointed! Table we were seated at had a broken leg. Hot tea arrived lukewarm. Had to send back my plate to be heated. Tea cup had lipstick on it. Seated upstairs where heat wasn't turned on-had to eat with our coats on. Waitress told us that \"it's wasn't policy to offer compensation for poor experiences.\" She was very apologetic & embarrassed, but made it clear that we wouldn't be offered a discount for the awful brunch experience.  We had a similar experience about 6 months ago at Ladles, but thought that we'd give it another chance. Needless to say, we won't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"This place has always been great but today my group of six received the worst service I have ever experienced. Both waitress had poor attitudes, it took an hour to get our food, which all came out at different times, and were not even the right orders...Had to find the waitress to get more coffee , waters , ketchup. When our friend finally did get her food , her pancakes looked off. After inspecting them there was a piece of chicken and a jalapeño underneath the top pancake.  ???  It was enough to ruin any appetite any of Us had left ."}
{"text":"Recently visited ladles and was not impressed despite recommendations from friends and family.  Ordered a light lunch of soup and Italian rice balls and both fell flat.  The crab bisque had little to zero crab, it's was thin and tasted more like a tomato broth. The rice balls were fried, crispy, and the breading was well seasoned but the rice and accompying sauce lacked any real favor.  Staff was nice but not sure if I'd come back."}
{"text":"Salads are hearty and the soups are all good . The cheesesteak sandwich is tasty .   Breakfast is worth a stop in . I recommend the waffles and chicken."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for breakfast when I'm visiting family in the area. I used to go here in high school/ college so often when I lived in the area. Now that I'm away, I often stop by for breakfast when I'm back \"home.\"  Here's why this is the spot to go for breakfast: -large portions -fresh ingredients -unique options...like lobster omelets (I remember this being a special once) -A nice atmosphere  As for the atmosphere, it is comfortable, clean, and cute. They also have an upstairs area with multiple rooms for seating, though I'm not sure how often it is used. The whole place is nice, even the bar, and it is just a comfortable restaurant to sit in and enjoy good food for an hour or two with friends or family.  Other than breakfast, they do have great lunch and dinner options. I especially love their soups and salads. Definitely a spot to stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place nestled within Springdale over the summer. The highlight of Ladles is the excellent homemade soups. On any given day, you'll find a half dozen or more soups available.  One of their staple soups is Italian Wedding which is one of the best I've tasted in the area. They also have a very tasty Meatball Vegetable which, in my opinion, needs to be offered daily. If these don't sound appetizing to you, head on over to their Facebook page to see today's soups.  Someone meticulously updates their page daily.  Ladles offers a great selection of sandwiches, salads, and entrees as well. They typically bring you rolls with your meal, including some great flavors of butter, including strawberry.  The only negative is that the prices are a tad on the high side. However, you won't go home hungry, and you'll likely have something to take home with you.  I'd recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Happy Happy Yummy!  The California Salad is fantastic.  Comes with apple slices, bleu cheese, and candied pecans with a very nice strawberry balsamic vinaigrette dressing made in-house.   Can't wait to go back again!   I ordered the Italian Wedding Soup for starters - huge portions and soup was better than I expected.   Will go back next time I'm in town.     Also, nice holiday desserts offered - snowball cake, peppermint candy cheesecake to name a few goodies."}
{"text":"So we decided to check out Ladles since a friend highly recommend it. We are new to the area and thought to ourselves, heck...what can we loose checking it out? We didn't loose anything, we gained a new favorite. :-D We were seated shortly after walking in, even though they were very busy. Our server came quickly, we ordered, got our drinks and food quickly. I got the Country Breakfast Supreme and my husband got the Spicy Chicken Hash. The quality of our food was awesome-both dished were fabulous. Loved the eggs! The buttermilk pancakes had a little vanilla or something in them and wow, they were like fluffy, pieces of cake.   The décor is very cute and the place is homey, plus they have a lot of parking.   I read through a lot of this places reviews and feel others have been overly critical of this lil gem. If it's busy, don't expect instant gratification. If you don't pay attention to the menu...that is your own fault. I would absolutely check this place out despite the reviews and we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Ended up going here on Christmas Eve because it was less than a mile away from another (higher) rated Yelp spot a little down the road that was closed. The other place must have been revolutionary because the food here was incredibly impressive and the prices were very cheap considering the quality. If definitely return and recommend this spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  We had an appointment in Springdale today and asked where to go for lunch. Ladles proved to be more than we expected. We enjoyed our lunch, the staff was very friendly, and the facility is quite pleasant. We plan to go again soon and we plan to ask another couple to go with us!  And there was off free street parking!"}
{"text":"The staff and food were both amazing! Beautiful atmosphere. Great overall experience. I had an omelet and potato pancake for my breakfast, I highly recommend both."}
{"text":"While at a hockey tournament in PA, my daughter and I stumbled upon this place. First off the service was excellent. We were greeted at the door, immediately seated and had drinks within 5 minutes.   We were there for lunch, but quickly realized they had amazing homemade Italian food, so we went with entrees. I had the Steak Marsala Gnocchi. It was 5 star! For a starters I had Greens & Beans soup that was just as good as back home. My daughter went with spaghetti and meatballs with Italian Wedding soup, which she also said was just like the food I prepare at home.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First getting seated was confusing. The table we seat at was dirty with bird poop on it. The waitresses was abrasive and could careless what we wanted. They ran out of apple juice at 1045 in the morning. Running out of something 3:45 minutes after opening is unacceptable. Plus the order was wrong. I live here and brought family because it use to be good. I will not come again service was horrible. I really use to like this place."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I was last here, I remember the food being decent so we decided to try it out now that we live back in the area.  I wish I had a chance to see if the food was as good as I remembered.  Upon entering we stood patiently in the awkward \"waiting area\", ten minutes later we were finally greeted, told it would be about five minutes for a table, and asked to wait in the bar area.  After ten minutes of sitting at the six stool bar watching the staff chat amongst eachother I left!  Never offered a drink, never greeted, nothing!  I'll take my money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good menu options at Ladles, which has a rustic homey interior. I opted for their special of the day, a sante fe omelet with grilled chicken, peppers, onions and cheese. It was kind of disappointing because there wasn't much flavor. It was big though, and the Mancini toast was good as expected. The fruit cup was freshly cut but really only had bananas and Granny Smith apples. The waitress was nice and quick, and the coffee cups were constantly filled. I guess more than anything, I was just disappointed in the flavor- or lack there of- in the omelet."}
{"text":"This is quaint little restaurant in Springdale Borough, PA. On the main drag near the Dollar General. Small and friendly. Expansive menu. If you can't find anything you like...I can't help you. Lol.  Get there early space and parking is limited. Great food and great prices.  Won't break the bank. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's always a win discovering a new favorite locally owned breakfast spot, and Ladles fits the bill for generous portions of traditional breakfast fare at reasonable prices. The omelettes are large 'n fluffy with ample fillings mixed in with the eggs (yes, there IS a difference!). The omelette varieties include the classics plus plenty of options for the vegetarian like crab, portabella 'shrooms, roasted red peppers, spinach, feta, or asiago cheese. Don't forget the sides - requisite Mancini's Italian bread and your choice of either homefries or authentic potato pancakes + sour cream. While both might be tasty, the homefries are well seasoned and...the better option. The endless cup of coffee is quality as was the service, which was friendly and attentive to boot. The nondescript building looks to be an old converted apartment structure and the dining space is quaint yet inviting. Ladles is worth many a return visit for the large, value laden breakfast menu...can't wait to try 'em out for dinner!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. I had the Greek dinner salad, my wife had the Polish grilled cheese, draft beers for both. One member of our party had a chicken Parmesan the size of your forearm. Great food,great service. Very nice."}
