{"text":"This is pretty greasy place. The menus are well worn probably hand laminated jobs. They've got one of those metal garage door like covers for the front of the building after they close. They had one server, I think she's about 12.

I had the \"crazy omelet.\"  I don't eat meat that often but with a name like that I had to give it a try. It was pretty good.

Their prices are on par for the kind of down home grease restaurant it is.

Thumbs up"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this diner. They only take cash, just a fair warning, but the food has always been good quality, for inexpensive prices. It's also so filling, I remember having breakfast at 7:30am Saturdays during summer semester at school, at I had a 9-1 Psychology class... I'd still be satisfied at 3pm. Plus the service is always amazing, the owners are so kind and easy to get along with."}
{"text":"I love this place! The decor isn't the best but for the price I am paying, I get good customer service and good tasting food. Can't beat it in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great little diner in downtown Cleveland. The Fifth Wheel is literally a family business. The parents work in the back making food, and sometimes the mom will work the counter, but their son takes care of the table orders and does a better job than most servers at high class restaurants.

The food is perfect home cooking, just like mom used to make. I had the sausage and gravy with eggs and coffee. I think the food itself only cost $5.25, not too shabby. 

This place definitely isn't big on decor. There's a lot of random thrifted reproduction paintings as well as handmade posters advertising specials. The crowd is also of the neighborhood, so don't be intimidated (or rude). 

Neither of these reasons, however, is why a point was deducted. I liked the place a lot, but it wasn't amazing. The person I ate with rated it five stars, though. 

If you're feeling adventurous or just love perfect diner food and a great greasy spoon, then definitely try this place.

*They're also trying to collect soccer balls to send to their home country, so if you're feeling generous and bring one along, or ask them about if you're apprehensive."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to get breakfast. The sausage gravy & biscuits with two scrambled eggs are my go to. Coffee is good--and unlimited. It's also very cheap. The owners are amazing people who run this restaurant 7 days a week from very early in the morning (5am) to late afternoon (4:30pm). 

I'd recommend coming here. I'm the Duke, after all. :)"}
{"text":"Okay mom and pop diner type of place. They only take cash so leave your credit cards at home. My only complaint is that the sausage was not very good. The meal was mediocre...not bad though. Not sure if I will come again."}
