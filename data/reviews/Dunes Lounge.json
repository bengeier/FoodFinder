{"text":"Worst lounge to ever goto. Bartender couldn't even figure out my age arlfter I had showed her 4 ids from 4 different states. The bar stinks like drugs and garbage. People are low lives and are rude as well as the bartender. How professional is it when a bartender asks you if you know where to get cocaine? Be careful of the low lives stealing beers, drinks and personal items fom you when you are not looking. Worst bar ive ever been too. The staff are far from professional.  They will never have my buisness again and I would encourage anybody never to step foot in this dump. Dont even get me started at all the bugs and roaches roamimg around the floors and pool tables. I would never ever recommend this bar to anybody. I also forgot about all of the underaged kids who hang out get drunk and be obnoxious. I cannot stress how much this bar needs to be investigated and shut down. What bar allows underage kids to run around the bar and get obnoxious drunk? Overall experience: very unprofessional,  dirty environment (bugs),  underage kids, very very poor customer service. This bar is a scrubby place to goto. Very very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I stopped in last week and got into their free Texas Holdem game.  Nice crowd and cheap liquor made it a good time. I came back the next morning and they remembered me, which was cool. Over all I like this place as a clean cheap neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"If you like DUIs or like people driving out on the street wasted without being cut off by a bartender then this is the place for you!!!! They will serve you to the point that you can barely walk and then watch you drive off into the sunset. But dont worry the customer service doesnt end there ~ Your bartender will even send you a cute little text message (because she knows you are beyond wasted) just to make sure you got home okay.... LOL if you have to send a customer a text message to make sure they got home okay then uummmmmmm hint maybe you shouldnt have served them so much and just maybe hopefully the liquor board will investigate this shaddy bar. I use to bartend and in no way shape of form should anyone be allowed to drink as much as this bar does without cutting them off!!!! This bar is a danger to our roads..."}
{"text":"I like this place. Cheap drinks and friendly bartenders. I tend to stay away during the weekends because it gets super loud to the point you can't have a conversation and there's karaoke. I'm not a big fan of karaoke. 

The crowd is diverse. Some shady others not so much. The bartenders are cool and remember your name. 
Pool tables darts and poker makes it a worthy place to check out during the week. Ladies night is Wednesday's and they have $1 shots too."}
{"text":"Just recently moved a few block's away from this place. We had my brother in law over this past Sat and he wanted to go somewhere for a drink. He said he loved dive bars. Which I'm certainly not opposed to. Some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars. So we decided to give this place a chance. Shouldn't have wasted our time. Walked in and no hello from the bartender. Stood at the bar for 8 mins with not a single I'll be right with you or single hello. Meanwhile the bartender has time to hug other customers , refill other drinks, check herself out in the mirror, everything but help us. I should have known when we walked in and the entire bar turned around and starred at us like we were from out of town. No, we are locals. The bar wasn't even busy literally just the bar had about 8 people at it. So we walked out and went to try The Hideaway on Northern. That bartender needs to give the one at The Dunes a lesson in customer service. She welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in. That's bar 101. No worries, Caroline at the Hideaway got our tips that afternoon. The Dunes I'd never go back to. The Hideaway we would."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood bar with down to earth vibe. The prices are easy in the wallet and hardworking staff made me feel comfortable while gaving a draft and talking business

It's not a great neighborhood but it's been here forever and is nicer than you might think. Glad I gave it a try"}
{"text":"normal hole in wall bar, friendly patrons, and friendly bartender.. Kilt is on Tap there,,, so it was very nice place to wait for the wife on her 2 hour interview nearby !! 

When in the area, def will be back !!"}
{"text":"Update 04/01/17

So I doubt my review did anything to the dunes but three months ago I posted about this bar, since then the bar has undergone new ownership and there have been some improvements. It a refreshing change and I'm excited to see what other improvements will be made. Hopefully the outside will be done. I upgraded my star rating to the dunes because of the improvements.


Original post:
The dunes, there's a lot to say about this place. It's not great by any means. The staff for the most part is always pretty good. They're is a high turn around on the bar tenders however. That's probably because this place is always dead.  The outside of the dunes is God awful and the owners need to spend some money to renovate this dump. Both out side and inside need work. But off the outside of the building I nearly skiped this place. It's looks like a ran down ghetto nudie bar, that you're most likely going to catch something incurable. The only two reasons I go back is because it's so close to my place and beer is cheap. Even the cheap beer prices and really close proximity to my house still make it hard to stop in some days. If it was not for bartender's like Karin and Summer, and the DJ Jeromy who is not always here, and cheap beer. Im sure this place would go under. 

The owners of the dunes need to get off there ass. Recognize that your bartender's work to save this dump, the owners need to help them out by fixing this place up and having a nice place to have a drink. Fix this place up and I'll pay more for my beer.

I give the bartender's, DJ, and cheap beer 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sunny B. dragged me out to her pal's kiddy birthday party at a park somewhere in Glendale. Being that we had earlier been to Dick's Hideaway for breakfast & requisite Mimosa's by the time we left the kiddy party we were ready for a cocktail. The rule was - next bar or restaurant with a bar we see we're stopping. Boy did we luck out. Not the divey-ist of dives, the Dunes really fit the bill. An oasis in the desert, on the border of Glendale and Phoenix but I guess technically in Phoenix. Friendly bartender. Old men day drinking. Sunny B. instantly made friends- with this old guy that insisted upon showing her his \"donkey\". After multiple offers to show Sunny his donkey, she finally consented. I was on the edge of my seat....

Strong drinks. Strong.

BOTTOM LINE: Drop on by, you might get to see a donkey"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to the Dunes back in the day! Went on a hot August night with some of my son's friends parents and I have to say he he place hasn't changed much over the years except now there isn't the stale smoke or beer smell.

Ordered at the bar from a young female bartender. Beers were cold with a good selection. They even have Modelo, but no ciders.  

Karaoke at 9. Two pool tables and a digital jukebox with something for everybody. Bathrooms clean and starting to be remodeled.

The Dunes is a classic dive bar at its finest. No drama, cold beer and good people!"}
