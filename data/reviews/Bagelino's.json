{"text":"I was really hoping this would be a great bagel place. it has all the necessary menu items, friendly staff, and modest location. Too bad I had the worst bagel I ever tasted. The dough was a bad texture with a strange flakiness. The bagel was very bland, and the ingredients in my breakfast bagel were under-seasoned."}
{"text":"The home-made soups are great. Not generic. They are not afraid of the spice jar.
I love the Californian sandwich. It's not something I've seen anywhere else. Artichoke, sun-dried tomato, a little mustard. Delicious. 
Excellent, fresh bagels."}
{"text":"I finally found the best Bagel shop in Calgary! Their bagels are made fresh daily throughout the day so you get fresh warm soft yummy bagel all the time. You need to come early as they close at 4 pm (weekdays) and during the weekend which is a bummer. The owner, Paul, is very friendly and the service is really good. They always make me feel welcome -almost like coming back home. I love their onion and garlic bagel as well as the cinnamon one."}
{"text":"For a month I have been on the hunt for some good, healthy, fast food to grab for lunch with no luck.  But alas I have found my new favourite lunch spot!  I got their vegetarian everything bagel sandwich and all I can say is WOW!  All the ingredients were fresh and the staff were so friendly that I may be back here again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I was super pumped for bagelino's....great staff, cute shop...but when I got back to my office ready to enjoy my hearty veggie sandwich, I was disappointed to find there were no sprouts or advocado...and I only had two options for bagels...C'mon..It's a bagel shop! And I paid $7.35 for a bagel with only tomato, cucumber and lettuce. 

Sad to say, this my was my first and last stop at Bagelino's... Urban Bean up the road is also an independent shop, with good food and great prices. I think I'll take my lunch time hunger there."}
{"text":"Honestly nothing special in these bagel's had the everything maybe we got a bad one but it really lacked flavour. 
We also had the breakfast bagel it tasted like fish? Service is wonderful very friendly but they seem to think they are a big hit I beg to differ much better bagels in Calgary MUCH"}
{"text":"I go for the homemade soups often, and love them. 
They're quick and friendly, and it feels nice to support the ma and pa shops."}
{"text":"I had the cheese and onion bagel and it was  different than most bagels in a good way.  It was more fluffy and gave a bread-y experience.  Don't forget to get the cream cheese! The combination was perfecto!"}
{"text":"Bagelino`s has been kicking around Calgary`s downtown core for awhile.  I remember frequenting the Bagelino`s on the corner of 4th and 4th for years, before it disappeared and for me, \"miraculously\" cropped up again on 8th Ave and 7th Street.

Seeing that I am watching my waistline a bit, I dont indulge often at Bagelino's, since bagels are a healthy choice, but not a diet-friendly choice.  

Today, I succummed to Bagelino`s because they had a board out on the sidewalk advertising Tomato Soup as the special.  Tomato Soup is one of my favorites, so I was drawn in.

For lunch today, I did enjoy the delicious, homemade Tomato Soup, and I also got a whole wheat vegetarian bagel sandwich.  Over the years, I have tried different sandwiches there, and they have never disappointed me.

This restaurant has recently been bought and sold and is under new management.  As a result, I have seen no change for better or worse in quality.  The bagel sandwich I had today was consistent with the whole wheat bagels of previous owners and location.  Delicious, flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"I liked the texture of Bagelino's bagels, but I found that dough needed a bit more salt. Perhaps this is just a matter of taste.

Breakfast sandwiches were reasonably priced, but I'm not sure about the lunch ones.

Also, this is more of a bagel sandwich kind of joint than a buy-bagels-by the dozen kind of place. If you want a dozen, the cost is $16 or some other ridiculously high amount."}
{"text":"I LOVE Bagelino's, their bagels are authentic, chewy, taste fresh (because they are) and just overall delicious.

They also make the super trendy and very instagramable rainbow bagels which I picked up on my last visit, they will usually post on social media when they will be making them and then they ask that you pre-order and pay ahead of time. They don't have a minimum order though so if you just want one bagel that's totally cool. The rainbow bagels also come with funfetti cream cheese which is sweeter than your usual cream cheese and turn the bagel into more of a cake/dessert situation. So good! I loved the bright colours and the sweet cream cheese topped with super fun sprinkles, made me feel like a kid tucking in to lunch.

Usually when I visit I get the jalapeno bagel with plain cream cheese and pair it with soup for dipping. Soup of the day changes but it's usually pretty good, my ultimate favourite is the butter chicken soup - seriously so good!"}
{"text":"I pre-ordered online and got a text the same evening confirming my order and pick-up time. I was very impressed! 

I ordered the rainbow bagels and a few other varieties. The rainbow bagels were great with the funfetti cream cheese! 

The bagels have no preservatives, which is great. You just have to put them in the freezer if you want to have them for another day.

The staff were friendly and the location is a short walk from the C-Train."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving such a low rating because this place is so popular on social media, but honestly it was just really bad. 

I only tried the rainbow bagels with funfetti cream cheese- which is the reason their famous on social media. I pre ordered 6 rainbow bagels with one tub of the cream cheese ($35) and was told to pick up the bagels anytime between 7-4. I work 8:30-5 normally so I popped in bright and early at 7:30. 

You would think these would be the freshest bagels in the world because it's so early. What I got was the Most driest bagel I have ever encountered- it makes be believe these bagels were actually frozen and thawed and sold to me, not freshly made. They they so dry they were inedible. I literally ate half of one, thought it might just be the one, so I made another one and it was just as bad so I threw the rest out- such a waste of money and so disappointing. The funfetti cream cheese was good tho- but for the price and hype and for only the cream cheese to be good?!? Sorry but one star."}
{"text":"I've only tried the rainbow bagels so far, but they are incredible.  They are just plain flavour, but the best fresh bagels I've ever had.  And the most exciting presentation, that's for sure!"}
