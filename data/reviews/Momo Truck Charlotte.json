{"text":"They advertised it as \"lo mein\". I was given spaghetti noodles (seriously, SPAGHETTI NOODLES!!??) with vegetables that were barely even heated, let alone sauteed and had ZERO seasoning. Honestly they should be ashamed. The dumplings were very good, but I am assuming they are purchased already made, based on the horrendous rendition of lo mein. Also, we asked for Sriracha on the side, because we were sharing with a toddler. They put Sriracha all over everything, covering the dish."}
{"text":"Fabulous \"Momo\" dumplings in true Tibetan style!! First, I am a fan of dumplings and in particular Tibetan style. I discovered the momo dumplings in NYC when I lived there and they are my favorite food!! Imagine my joy to find the Momo truck in CLT! The dumplings are similar to other asian dumplings, tasty & savory, you can order chicken or vegetables. I think they have a flavor that will appeal to any dumpling fan. The owner was so fun to talk to and we both know my favorite NYC Tibetan restaurant (Cafe Himalaya). These dumplings come with two sauces, a sweet sauce, which was delicious & a spicy sauce, which was also tasty. I prefer the sweet with a tangy honey flavor. They also have other asian dishes, my friend had the vegetarian wrap and loved it. We found them at Blue Blaze brewery this time but if you follow the Momo truck on insta they post their schedule. Definitely give ya foodie taste buds a treat and eat some momos!!"}
{"text":"Best Noodles ever- balanced with spices, saut√©ed veggies & chicken. Katti Rolls is cheesy, meaty & a thing I won't miss next time too. Fried dumplings were crispy & delicious as well. This is by far the best food truck I have ever eaten from. Go! \"Momo Truck\" Go!"}
