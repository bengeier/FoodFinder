{"text":"Manager seems very rude...not even a smile or any acknowledgement...lady cashing was very nice...food was okay"}
{"text":"We will never ever go to this place ever again.......it's a rip off.  They are false advertising the menu on the wall says one price and when they charge you more money when you go to pick up.        The excuse is that rice is $2 extra and nan is extra plus a bunch of bull shit excuses rip off place and the food is nasty.  We fell sick eating their old kebabs.   The staff is very rude and no smiles.   Their family is the only ones writing good reviews on here.   Buyer beware.  Save your money go to another kebabs or even maim ana naan n kebabs are cheaper"}
{"text":"We had take out, first time there. Food was delicious, tasty and fresh. The chicken soup had loads of flavour, the lamb was great. We will definitely go back to try new dishes. Good place for groups, nice large tables with plenty of seating for sharsies! The mantoo dumplings and bolano were so good."}
{"text":"The first time I had it it was amazing! The other day I had it and it didn't live up to its expectation. The bolani wasn't as flavourful nor was the sultan I kabob. The chicken kabobs were not good at all. Mantuus were decent but I don't think I would go back again"}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. Got the eggplant and mantu appetizers and beef kabobs and tandoori chicken as mains. Every single thing lacked in flavor. The most disappointing was the tandoori chicken, the chicken was basically 5-6 pieces of boneless chicken thighs on a skewer and every single piece of chicken was mostly fat. It was so gross I threw most of it out as it was not edible. The rice also had a funky smell to it. The portions are extremely small and way too pricey for the amount of food and the lack of flavor. I definitely won't ever be coming back here. Also the lady at the cash was not friendly at all she was a robot taking orders never smiled or said thank you or anything. Found her rude. If you want this type of food do yourself a favor and drive to pickering and go to a place called food time. Muchhhh better food and generous size portions for much less $"}
{"text":"Over the past year and a half i've tried many shawarma plates all over the GTA and i have to admit that they have the best one. The veggies are cut perfectly, chicken is tasty, rice is cooked al'dente and the sauces... omg. The tahini is out of this world. 
You need to try!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Elias Special. The plate is big enough to feed 2 people. Flavours were good but the lamb was dry. Chicken has a good kick and the meet was very flavourful. Staff is friendly and place is clean. We will probably come back to try something else."}
{"text":"I heard good things on the local mom groups, so was excited to try!  However was disappointed :-( the meat was tough and while it was flavourful, I didn't really enjoy it. Hardly any veggies. The naan was very plain. We were so sad as we were very hopeful for a delicious place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. My husband really enjoyed it and I enjoyed the flavours immensely, but the quality of the chicken is not good. There were lots of googly, crunchy, gross pieces of chicken. 
I'm sure my husband will be back at some time and we'll see if the quality improves."}
{"text":"Just stopped in and I'm glad we did. I ordered the Shwarma plate after I saw someone else having it. Very tasty I ate the whole thing which is very unusual for me. The naan bread was piping hot with enough crunch and and soft hot center! Hubby ordered the kofta kabob dinner and said he enjoyed it but was eyeing my dinner so I let him taste it and he said he would definitely order this next time. The staff were friendly. The decor was simple but I was coming for the food not the ambiance."}
{"text":"First time trying it in Whitby. Hope them good quality and good food. If I found it bad, I would not hesitate to note that. It is not cheap though but good place inside and hopefully good food."}
{"text":"I'm on the road all over Ontario in sales and I have been to 100s of different restraunts in search of the best Chicken Shawarma and I rate Elias in the top 5. Why you may say? The chicken is juicy and spiced with an interesting mix of flavors. The onions, tomato's and cucumber are diced fine so as to ensure each bite has that perfect mix of flavor and the tahini and garlic sauce are creamy and perfect in my opinion. It's worth every penny as all the components combined work very well together. Quality is obviously key but oh so good! Hey, It's also a family run business which i love as well as I know my money is going back into the community. Nice Elias!"}
{"text":"This is a new place in town offering afghan cuisine. We ordered takeout for a family get together and were very satisfied with the customer service and especially the food. Serving sizes were plentiful, the meats were delicious and we really enjoyed the borani eggplant, mantoo and phirni dessert. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered Tandoori chicken kabob meal. Chicken was excellent and came with more rice than I could eat. Also salad and fresh baked naan. All in all quite good and friendly."}
{"text":"This is the second time in the row you guys have charged $2 on rice even though your menu says rice comes along with the order of kabob. your order taker goes through the order of what u get and then when you pay you add in extra $2 for the rice that comes with it. If you servers cannot understand than you need to change the server not the customers!!!! 

Also when your menu says chicken thigh and you offer kabob that's wrong advertising and then if asked why the difference I was told that's what we have. Why wasn't I told when I made the order? Plus the 1st week their food portions were a lot now they have become very stingy. Feel like their family and friends have upped the ratings here and on google.

Your food is good just the management is terrible. I feel I am done giving you a guys a chance. I won't be making a trip for your deceitful advertising!!!!"}
