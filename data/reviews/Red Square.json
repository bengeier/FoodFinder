{"text":"This Russian/ Turkish/ restaurant/night club or whatever it was is a disaster! It is a shame because the food is really good. The servers were HORRIBLE and it turned out to be a very disappointing evening for my family. We were never even offered drinks the entire evening!  We had to beg for water and menus.  The appetizers eventually made their way out of the kitchen after the meals arrived.  Our server quit half way during our dinner!  The owners really need to figure out the restaurant's identity and get their act together if they want to make it.  I feel bad about writing this review because the chef (former chef of Ceder Center Anatola) is excellent.  :("}
{"text":"Went there at 5:30 on a Wednesday to find the place locked up, despite the website hours saying it would be open.  No signs or anything to indicate why it was closed, and phone calls went to voicemail, very disappointed"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Antalya Red Square, for lunch that is. The food is really good, the interior being a curious blend of Turkish chintz with a Russian after taste. One of my Russian coworkers identified it as Azerbaijani, a former soviet republic and part of the Ottoman Empire before that.  Anyhow, I digress. You might have better luck eating lunch there on a weekday than dinner. The server is really nice and hard working (read, overworked). My favorite is their falafel sandwich, chicken Shawarma or even the Lamb Kofte sandwich. As of May 2008 the lunch special cost 7 dollars including the lentil soup, not a bad deal.  The sandwich is hard to finish after the soup and hot pita but it keeps you full until dinner. The falafel is crunchy and wholesome, nestled in a bed lettuce, onions and tomatoes that benefit from the creamy dollop of hummus. Closed on Mondays."}

{"text":"We discovered this restaurant by accident for dinner (used to be a korean restaurant location). When we walked in, there weren't a lot of people there but i'm glad we stayed.  The food is delicious and definitely high quality. We ordered the dinner for two--small mixed appetizer, kabab mixed platter and two kinds of dessert--and it was very good. The hummus is some of the best i've tasted and is served with a warm pita basket, that will be refilled upon request to the waiter. Every time we've come back the food has been spot-on.  What i feel that's lacking though is the atmosphere. There's no one to greet you at the front when you walk in so it feels like you're intruding on a private party, the decor is sparse and not at all cozy. I would definitely come back but the restaurant owners could make it more welcoming."}
