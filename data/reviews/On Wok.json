{"text":"Tuck inside a food court at Shops on Yonge. They have a good choices of Korean style dish and combo meals. The price is very reasonable and the combo meals comes with Korean style banchan and soup. Decent portion and good flavour. The auntie here is so friendly and nice. We ordered the spicy chicken rice ($9) and love the mild spicy taste with the right amount of sweetness. The combo meals come with three banchan, soup and a light flavour green tea. The bibimbap was with generous portion of mixed vegetables and of course the egg add more flavours to the rice."}
{"text":"Friendly service and even better food.  Portions are generous, well presented and tastes great...at least the kimchi stew I had.  Will definitely be back to try other offerings."}
{"text":"Located in the 2nd floor food court at Shops on Yonge, there is plenty of space to sit and eat. Even as you walk by the store fronts, deciding what to eat, you are greeted by a warm and friendly face at On Wok.   You can choose what you want to eat, order, and if sittinf at a table you can bring your green tea back with you to sip on while your food is being cooked. When ready, they sometimes bring it to your table.   I always order the dolsot bibimbap but without any meat. It's always really good! There's sometimes a variation of the veggies you will get that day, depending on what is fresh and in stock I presume.   I always throw on the Korean hot sauce and the combination of that with the rice and veggies is always perfect. You also get soup with the combo and that is always delicious as well. Side dishes vary as well. You usually get 1-3.  Tonnes of parking underground.   I come here quite often and will continue to do so in the future. It's a good place for a bite to eat if you're in the area."}
