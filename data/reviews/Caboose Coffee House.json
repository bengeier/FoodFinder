{"text":"By far the best place for lunch in the Junction, in my opinion. A (small) daily selection of homemade dishes, always with some variety, such as vegan out vegetarian options. All dishes are freshly made with fresh, often local ingredients. I have enjoyed each and every dish I've had. And you always get treated in a very personal, warm way; like family. Yes, the place is small, a feature I enjoy very much. It's a private, family-run business in a previously residential place."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the hood to have a quality americano. Always a veggie friendly option. Great atmosphere and people."}
{"text":"When one sees all 5 star reviews for a place that's not well reviewed one kind of wonders if it is family and friends that are pushing a place into prominence. I wasn't so wary as the FTR person is known by moi somewhat. Alas this place didn't live up to the hype. Tiny spot with minimal seating (a communal table takes much of the space) apparently there is a patio in the back but I didn't get a chance to see it due to the weather. Good selection of Kusmi teas. So far so good but one thing was showstopper for me as I was in the mood for dessert but once I saw fly hovering on the muffin I was immediately put off baked goods. Next comes the cappuccino Here is the verdict on the cappuccino Espresso:Mid strength.  Crema': OK Milk froth: Poor Latte Art: N/A  A very poor attempt at a cappuccino and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I work nearby and can always count on Caboose for having something healthy and yummy for lunch!"}
{"text":"Come on and shake your caboose over here!   Having opened at the end of 2013, with 0 reviews 7 months on, this was definitely a hidden gem I stumbled upon. Run by a mom and daughter this coffee shop feels like an extension of the house it's in. Behind the counter are the steps to the kitchen and outside down a narrow alleyway is a quaint patio over looking a small garden filled with a variety of vegetable plants (I'm no gardener but I definitely saw some cabbage and other veggie plants there).   Seating is pretty limited both inside and out, but I feel pretty confident that you're likely to find a spot unless it's the peakest of hours.   My latte here was nothing fancy, but it was very frothy and delicious, I personally prefer a slightly stronger caffeine taste to my drinks, but I'm not going to have a personal preference hold me back from giving Caboose a full 5 stars of approval.   I'm definitely going to returning here to try out their food and have a go at the pour over coffee!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Although the staff are very nice, the location was clean, and had a hipster feel if the product doesn't deliver then its all for nothing.  I would expect with the amount of effort that went into this place that they would roast their own coffee but this is not the case, their coffee comes pre-roasted from a distributor and it as average quality. For $2.50 I was disappointed.  It is also smaller than your typical small size cafes in Toronto so don't bet on getting a seat unless you want to sit at a communal table with another guest.  I would not come back."}
{"text":"The mom and daughter who work here are so lovely and friendly!  Prices are reasonable, and as Dishan mentioned, the place seems packed but as soon as I got my tea, someone vacated their seat (there seem to be a whole crowd of hipsters in there typing away on their Macs and talking/or about making it in the music scene in Toronto) A great addition to the neighbourhood!  I'm not a coffee drinker, but the tea selection was really unique, some very interesting blends.  I would love to come back here when the weather is nicer!"}
