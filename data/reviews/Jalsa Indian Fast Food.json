{"text":"- Food was good, felt there was something missing from making it great, it is almost there but not there yet, not sure what but felt that on most things.
- we ordered pau bhaji and they put nuts on (ofcourse it was not written), i sent it back because my kids are allergic and the chef was screaming at the top of her voice why it was returned, don't people know how to read (written where ? ???). The waiter was apologizing, i felt bad for the kid, he was probably working and studying somewhere."}
{"text":"The Restaurant at glance seems pleasant. However the dishes though numerous, are very ordinary in taste and very pricey. Not worth it better to go elsewhere where u can get better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Such great prices and a different take on Indian. A local hole in the wall. The owners are also super nice and give great service."}
{"text":"Tried dosa and not happy at all. Will try their more popular dishes of vada pav or pav bhaaji next time. The entrance door is confusing. It happened with and another two gentlemen."}
{"text":"Best Dabeli in North America hands down. I have had dabeli at other restraints in new jersey and new york but nothing beats Jalsa. Their Pao Bhaji is amazing and the best I have had in GTA. Their prices are very nominal and service is great too. What more you can ask. Definitely my goto place for indian street food."}
{"text":"We used Jalsa kitchen's services for a gathering at our place. The food was of excellent quality and the order was ready on time. Above all, the owner was an absolute gentleman. We placed an order for 50 guests and the owner cautioned us against ordering in excess and he was correct - the quantity was adequate for 70 + guests. We are happy to have used their services and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone"}
{"text":"Very very nice food, I've been here 2 times now and tried many different things and pretty much each one of them excels really well. Would go there again the 3rd time.

Update: the place isn't good anymore. Something happened dramatically bad and the food quality went down the drain. Changing from 5 star to 2 star"}
{"text":"Pretty good chat restaurant although they have much more. I had a few of the dishes and all were made very well. The best was the dhai puri. The service was very very quick. I was surprised at that. 

Only reason for a 4 is because I've been spoiled by another chat restaurant in New Jersey. The food isn't as good as Bombay Talk."}
{"text":"Two carnivores decided to go eat vegetarian Indian food today and were pleasantly surprised. 

The service was fast and our server was knowledgeable when we asked what he would recommend. 

We ended up getting misal pav which came with pav bun and a bowl of nuts. It was really spicy but full of flavor. We also got special pav bhaji which came with pav bun as well. This one wasn't spicy and it was also really tasty. We decided to order dessert and got the royal falooda which is a drink with ice cream and crushed nuts and jelly like things in it (kinda like a ice cream float). 

The prices were really good, around $6-9 for an entr√©e. Ps when they say something is spicy it's really spicy!"}
{"text":"Good Indian Street food, I couldnt make up my mind on what to order and ended up ordering way too much! None the less, tasty! (keep in mind while small plates... they add up to make one VERY filling meal!!)

The staff were friendly and gave the right amount of attention to us with out doting on us but checking up on us regularly. Our server made a few good suggestions and ended up ordering those and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Dont even try south indian. This place ia good only for street food. Paavbhaji was ok. Sandwiches are good. Chinese bhel is very good. Wada paav and dabeli..not so good. Chole bhature THE WORST I EVER TRIED. I have been to this plce many times so I have tasted everything here. Normal falooda is good don't try special falooda.not good at all."}
{"text":"Simply delicious food! The Bombay Bhel Poori is my favorite dish, although just about everything else on the menu is a close second. 

The servers are all really nice, and your food comes out hot, fresh, delicious, and fast!!"}
{"text":"Good food but service is waaaaaaaay too slow. We here for 3 hours just because there were 20 min intervals between each dish. Too too slow."}
{"text":"Service has deteriorated lately, most of the items in the menu are not available. Looked like the waiter himself was the cook as he used to disappear inside after taking the order. Also the portions are small. Food looked like it was assembled from the many ready-to-eat Indian snacks.
I won't be surprised if this place closes down in the near future."}
{"text":"Great place for veggie food!  Vada Pav is yummy. I really love them for their gola ganda-- I hope they always keep the gola ganda on their menu. It's a big thing that sets them apart from the other vegetarian eateries"}
{"text":"If I lived any closer I'd eat here every day. Very unique dishes that I haven't found anywhere else. The food is so good, I didn't even notice it was vegetarian until the second time I went.

Pros:
-Great tasting food
-Excellent value
-Serving size allows you to sample lots of items

Cons:
-Location is not open for Lunch Monday to Wednesday"}
{"text":"Love the food at Jalsa. The service is pretty good and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I just ordered some Dabeli, Chaat and Masala Fries today for Valentine's Day and it seemed to have been a big hit! The food was authentic and very flavourful. The food also looked like it did in the advertisements.

Jalsa also had great customer service - I live out of the province and wanted something delivered to my girlfriend's place at a certain time and the food was there at the exact time that I requested, along with a kind \"Happy Valentine's Day\" wish.

Thank you and will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great ambiance! Food is always served hot and never disappoints. This has become our favorite place to have an evening snack."}
{"text":"I would've given a review of the food I ate at this place but sadly I never got around to it. 
Went to Jalsa on a Thursday night with my family and was VERY disappointed with the customer service of the place. We were the second party in line to be seated in a restaurant which was about 80% full but no one from the working staff came to ask us the number of people, tell us the wait time or if we were dinning in or taking food to-go. After about 20 minutes of waiting, not moving up in the waiting line and watching the two servers walking around with completely disregard of the costumers waiting, I decided to go and ask for a to-go menu so we could just get the food and leave. Upon asking for the menu and amount of time it would take to prepare 3 appetizers to-go, we were told that the wait will be about an hour. It was at this point where I had had enough and lost my patience to wait around and decided to go elsewhere. 
All in all a very very poor experience. 
I would recommend to go here during the time they don't have a lot of people in the restaurant or more staff working and please let me know how the food was. 
cheers"}
{"text":"This place was quite disappointing. Reading the reviews my family and I went in with high hopes to have some great Indian evening snack kind of foods. 

1. The service is the worst I've had in a long time. They seated us and then forgot about us. It took them 10 minutes to bring us water and take our menu even though the restaurant wasn't very busy. They never at any point asked how our meal was and mostly ignored us. 

2. The food itself is oily, mostly tastes of spices and the restaurant provides very small portions. What really annoyed me is the poor service in bringing the food. 

My mother received her meal and we figured they would take a few minutes so told her to go ahead and eat. My sister and I received our dosa just as my mother finished her dish so she was left staring at us while we ate. The common stance when serving multiple people food is to bring it out at once or to bring it very close together. 10 minutes apart doesn't count as being acceptable. 

- The pain puri was ok -  nothing to write home about.
- The sabudana vada was the only good part about this meal
- The sada dosa was good for what it is - plain dosa
- The accompanying sambar was incredibly watery and cold despite our dosa being incredibly hot
- The Pav Baji simply tasted of masala. In India when you buy Pav Baji you can taste the vegetables and the butter but at this establishment you can taste only spices that weren't properly cooked out. It was passable for cheap Indian food. 
- The dosa was incredibly greasy and parts of the dosa were quite thick and became soggy quickly 
- The mango lassi was ok but for the price the portion quite small 

$40 for a meal where we were provided slow service, passable food and overall a mediocre experience.

We will not be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food made me feel sick. Pav bhaji was gross and pulav was D I S G U S T I N G. I would give this place 0 stars but it won't let me."}
{"text":"They have moved from Mississauga.
Love the Mumbai style buffet with vada pav, pav bhaji, mumbai sandwiches."}
{"text":"This chaat place has among the best pav bhaji, ragda pattis, bhelpuri & other chaat items.
It is clean & efficiently run.
The con: when I checked in on Yelp, there was a free offer of a lassi with a Bombay Frankie. The owner would not honor it saying it is an outdated offer & they have nothing to do with Yelp offers! I think this is quite un professional- they could have honored the offer & offered me a lassi, especially as I did not see any expiry date on the offer.
Yelp also needs to review this offer with restaurants as this has happened to me previously in other restaurants.
I don't know who is to blame here."}
{"text":"Bombay style street food with an all you can eat buffet - pav bhaji, pani puri, Vada pav, samosa as well as South Indian staples like dosa and idli and upma. Nice to see this concept of all of you can eat street food.

The Bombay side of their menu is way better than the South Indian - I advised them to focus on it. Service was friendly but their rate of replenishment for menu items left a bit to be desired.

This location in Brampton is bigger but much plainer than the earlier one in Mississauga. 

Don't know how good the Ala carte is."}
{"text":"I loved the place. Finger biting taste of Mumbai."}
{"text":"A very cozy restaurant for South Asian street food. A brief visit had me enjoy a very exciting plate of Chaat papri, an excellent choice of a side along with  Dahi  bhallas.  Service was prompt but very meek."}
{"text":"Over priced, poor portion sizes. It's quite sad that they used to have great portion sizes for the price but unfortunately after a few months the quality and portion size decreased. Quite disappointed being a 25 year patron of the Erin mills area and a passionate foodie."}
{"text":"Great food, authentic taste. 

The only downside is that service can be slow at times. Slightly expensive for the value."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!!! Try the dahi puri (and make it spicy!), vada pav and veg cheese grilled sandwich. Those are loved by every single person in our entire extended family. Definitely a mandatory stop whenever I am in Mississauga."}
