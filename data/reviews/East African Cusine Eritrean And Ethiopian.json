{"text":"The food here is very good with excellent service. I like that there are a lot of options on the menu. I will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've never written a yelp review, but feel compelled to in this case. Damera was fantastic! I'm not sure I've ever eaten Ethiopian food but I'm going to correct that mistake!  Terry, who I think is the owner (she is at least the cook) couldn't have been nicer.  I had the Lamb Tibbs and (I think) the 4 Veggies, all great. The massive amounts of Injera bread was also great. I want to try the Shiro Wot next.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I developed a love of Ethiopian food during a high school trip to DC years ago. Move forward to present day, I have been to every Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurant in the Charlotte area (seriously, no joke). This place is hands down the best in the area. Terry, the owner is very pleasant and helpful to those who are unfamiliar with the cuisine. Her recommendations are always on point - follow her suggestions and you won't be disappointed. When Terry is not there, things do seem less organized. She mostly runs the restaurant by herself and I assume she hasn't trained other staff members properly for front-of-house duties. If you go, you absolutely must end the meal with the traditional roasted green bean coffee. The coffee service/brewing process is almost as good as the coffee itself. Watching her make it over a flame in the traditional ceramic jars is mesmerizing. If interested, read more about the coffee ceremony and the time of sharing, friendship, and community it is meant to foster (http://www.saveur.com/ethiopian-coffee-ceremony-bunna-cafe). Having spoken to many Ethiopian and Eritrean Charlotte residents, they all say this restaurant is their favorite. I could sit at the bar all day sipping coffee, eating sambusas, and watching the regulars play some form of pool in a separate room or talking with them and hearing their fascinating stories. I actually recommend sitting at the bar, which makes it easier to interact with Terry, the employees, and other patrons, plus it's the best location for people watching. She also sells the green coffee beans and injera. Don't let the decor, which is a bit dated and disorganized, and awkward location deter you from trying this gem of a restaurant. When I lived in Charlotte, I dined here at least once a week (sometimes daily) and was never disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited location four times. First two times were great. Second two times strange and terrible. Third trip ... sign said they were open, but the doors were locked; left hungry and went to get delicious Korean food. Last time, doors open, place empty, one lady in there couldn't understand what I was asking. When the main lady finally came in, she took my order and came back 10 minutes later and said she couldn't serve me; said she wasn't feeling well, apologized and walked away. I really liked this place, but I'll NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is horrible. Placed an order through doordash twice and got incorrect food delivered both the times. 2nd time I was pretty annoyed and asked doordash to help re-deliver which took them 90 mins. My dasher was there in 20 mins and they made him wait over an hour to make one dish to be re-delivered. Never ordering from here again. There are much better Ethiopian restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. Terri the owner was very sweet and took the time to show us how to properly eat traditional East African cuisine. The food was very good and wasn't too spicy. I definitely recommend going here if you'd like to be exposed to something different!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and lovely owners. You can tell they love to share their food and culture with their hungry guests:) we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Very good beef dish. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I thought East African Cuisine Eritrean and Ethiopian was closed. I stopped on two occasions. I thought welp, that's just one more Ethiopian restaurant closed in Charlotte.  My friend wanted me to meet her there and insisted they were open.  I had my doubts but rolled in and what did I see????  An illuminated OPEN sign! Yipppeeee!  We walked in a little carry out space with a couple of high top tables, looked like take out,  the lady had a steam table loaded with 8 dishes, it's kind of like buffet, but Terry fixes your plate. (I used to work with a waiter from NY, when Southerners said, \"fixin\", he would say, \"is it broken?\")   She loads it up with all the veggie dishes, there were one or two meat options too.  I didn't try any, now I'm mad at myself, why didn't I?  Plenty of injera and Terry's homemade hot sauce available. The door to the bar is open, so you can sit in the bar with your heaping plate of goodness, there's even a patio if you would like to sit outside, but not a lot of shade so it would have to be the perfect afternoon for al fresco dining.  We enjoyed our lunch, barely talking, scarfing down our food, Ethiopian is one thing that I cannot eat fast enough!!!  If I'm with people, I have to make myself stop and talk.   Be sure to make time for coffee service.  Ethiopian coffee is unique.  They hand roast the beans, grind them, steep in a tiny, clay pot and serve with warm milk, tiny cups and popcorn. WHAT THE WHAT?  My head exploded.  I had a most enjoyable lunch, can't wait to return!  Lunch is $10 and on Wednesdays it's $9!!!!!!!!  CUNW."}
{"text":"I've never had east african food before so i cant compare but this is gooooood. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is a seriously under-patronized neighborhood spot. The food is SOOO good. Assuming it is quiet due to it's location (next to a laundromat in an older strip mall), but don't be fooled by it's exterior.  Terry is the owner & operator and is there during all restaurant hours. She's your waitress, your bartender and your chef. While she may have a secondary service assistant, she's really the force behind the business.  If you are a vegetarian EAT HERE ALREADY! For $14.99 you can get a huge vegetarian platter for two (platter for one is $9.99, I believe). Terry will pile the injera high with lentils, spinach/collard mix, eggplant, okra, cabbage and any other treats she's prepared that day. You also get additional injera to eat with prior to pulling your edible plate apart.The eggplant was so good that I got two servings for dinner and came back for another serving for lunch the next day. Seriously, I have an addiction to this dish.  They also have authentic Ethiopian drinks and coffee, as well as lots of yummy looking meat dishes (sorry, I can't speak to those).  Please come over and try this neighborhood spot. I'd hate to see it fold because the neighbors didn't know it was open or how good the food really is. And with the weather warming up, take note that there is a FANTASTIC patio in the back so that you can dine al fresco."}
{"text":"Kebsa rice with chicken so so good. Came with curried rice and side sauces that brought even more flavor to the dish. My first east african dish but will not be my last! Plus the owner is a really nice woman."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by for Ethiopian food. Homemade and the staff is very nice. Upfront disclosure, I'm not a big fan of Ethiopian food, so I can't really rave about how good the food is but I can say that the owner is nice and really tried to promote the Ethiopian culture. He conversed with us about Ethiopia and the culture and politics and left us intrigued about the country."}
{"text":"This place from the outside looks unassuming, but do not be fooled. When you come in their are lots of traditional Ethiopian decorations. The smell of Berbere spices hits your nose and you're instantly hungry. Terry (the owner and chef) came out to greet us and explain what everything  was ( though we already knew what we wanted) the wait time was not long at all. Everything is prepared fresh daily. Also at night  (after 8pm) they have traditional music and hookah. I would say this would be an excellent place to bring large groups or families."}
{"text":"Really great! This is a small, mom and pop-type restaurant. I tried the traditional Ehtiopian/Eritrean dishes, and the food was delicious! And it is a really good value. Portion sizes are pretty large and prices are low. The decor is not the best, but don't let that turn you off from the restaurant.  They do have some American food, too, but I did not try that.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Do not judge by its outside! Amazing food, amazing service! Truly authentic and affordable prices."}
{"text":"Funky little place. Interesting delicious food. Owner, chef, hostess all the same person comes out and talks. She will explain food figure out how spicy you want,etc. Don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is the first Ethiopian restaurant in Charlotte that I have been to.  I love Ethiopian food, and I have become fan of this place. The food is delicious and is in-line with my expectations. The staff is friendly. The server explained me few things about tomato sauce that comes with Tibzi, and provided me suggestions on the tibzi. The shrimp tibiz sounded interested. I had their vegetarian combo tibzi, instead. Got two extra rolls on the side. The meal size is more than enough for one person.   The place is decent and very relaxed. Probably, I was their first customer on that Saturday evening. The staff is relaxed, and not in a hurry. I had a very peaceful and delicious meal.  I liked the lentils and tomato sauce, the most. The cabbage, potato stuff was good as well. I liked the food so much that I must have overate it. That's what happens when we find good food. I visited Ethiopian place after long time. I am glad I found something this nice.  I highly recommend this place for the Ethiopian cuisine. Apparently, they have some Italian dishes on the menu as well. Isn't that funny? :-)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! We had chicken and rice, okra, Alicha (sauteed cabbage, potato, and carrot), and Sambusa (fried pastry with beef). Service was good. Very helpful and friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and unique! Don't let the style keep you away the food is fantastic.  They can customize any dish to your taste.  I have already recommended this to friends.    I would give it 5 stars if the outside and inside were more palatable.    They have vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"In the midst of a horrible night, my girlfriend and I stopped in at around 1 AM. The proprieter of the bar and the clientele were so caring and welcoming that it saved our evening from despair. Thank you thank you thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious, very pretty inside & great customer service. The injera is to die for! We sat in the black booths which were really comfy as well."}
{"text":"Great homemade Ethiopian food- if you've never eaten Ethiopian before - this is the type of place where you can have good food without feeling nervous about ordering from an unfamiliar menu. Terry is so friendly and since she is the cook too she can cook to your spice level preference. Her injara (Ethiopian bread) is excellent and soaks up all the great sauce- we ordered the family plate and it pretty much summarizes all her dishes and can feed 4 well. She hosts singers who come to perform at her restaurant and while we haven't watched a show yet it sounds like fun. I will definitely be back. My kids 7 and 10 ate EVERYTHING the chicken was just right for them."}
{"text":"I had been craving Ethiopean food, so I searched and found this place. Everything was delicious. The spices were right. Especially liked the lentils and spicy beef dish that was the special.  Atmosphere is interesting... we went at an odd hour between lunch and dinner when it was empty... I'd be curious to see how how everything comes together when they're busy. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! My husband and I love ethnic food but never have eaten Ethiopian. The owner gave us her full attention and helped us make some great choices. She continued in the explain the culture and food. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Charlotte. The owner, Tammy, is very welcoming and friendly. The food is delicious. I ordered the Vegetable entree (stewed green beans, lentils, potatoes & cabbage)."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a small independently owned restaurant where the owner really cares about her food. Both times I have visited, the owner comes out of the kitchen frequently to explain dishes and ask how we like them. The food is fantastic and the prices are great. In all honesty, the restaurant has a run down bar feel, but that is part of its charm. You will definitely feel welcome when you walk inside and it would be impossible to not enjoy the fare."}
{"text":"I'm Hatian decent and my wife is Eritrean  which is an interesting  mix of cultures,we went to East African  Cuisine on Monroe rd  the service and the food was excellent this restaurant is definitely a keeper."}
