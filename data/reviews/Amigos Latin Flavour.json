{"text":"This spot is definitely a favourite. Not only is it super close by but the food is delicious. The churros are always made fresh and are reasonably priced. The sandwich named churrasco is the best. I get cravings to eat it every so often. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Recently just opened in the area. There is street parking as well as a private parking zone. The prices are phenomenal as most are under $10. Great flavour and service. The gourmet sandwiches come with either nachos or fries. Portions are great and you will definitely get full. There is also a free salsa bar on the side if you would like to add more pizazz to your order. Do not forget to also order your churros! Different flavours and fillings to soothe your appetite. Complementary Latin music inside if you'd like to eat in! Will definitely come back. Just as a heads up, they only accept debit card or cash. No credit cards."}
{"text":"Was craving Mexican food earlier today and this place recently opened up close to me so I decided to Ubereat it. It was cool nothing crazy, got 3 pulled pork taco's and a cheesy empanada (which tasted like a churro cause I guess they fry them in the same oil, don't know if it's a good or bad thing though lol). The tacos were decent, too much lettuce off the bat! The pulled pork had a great flavour, would of been nice if it was saucy as it was a dry rub. The bonus was the extra flour tortilla they put in, so you can pick up the extra lettuce and cheese that falls beneath while you eat. Didn't try the little sauce cause I don't eat cilantro!

All in all, if you so happen to be in the area, so happen to be hungry for Mexican, and so happen to have 10 bucks. Try it!"}
{"text":"BEST CHURROS IN TOWN!

in addition to good food, the husband and wife team is amazing, welcoming and sweet. They make everything in house including the buns for their sandwiches. Support local business!"}
