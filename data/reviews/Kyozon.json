{"text":"Without a doubt the most disgusting place I've ever been. 0 stars. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good. But the reviews are right. Do not eat there, food is borderline horrible the padthai is oky. But almost everything is salty. Good ambiance good drinks but thats all but overpriced."}
{"text":"Trop cher pour ce qu'ils offrent. Quelques éléments du menu n'étaient pas disponible. Bref, c'était très ordinaire."}
{"text":"Although this is a new establishment, with great decor and good vibe, there are many things not so great. Don't go expecting the best meal you've ever had. Although there were some items we tried that were very good like the steamed bun with pulled pork and the salt and pepper calamari, the other more interesting items need to be re-visited. Hopefully they can change these items to be what they were described as in the menu, and it will be a wonderful addition to the Montreal food scene."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but next time I might try their sushi. I ordered the baby corn and asparagus tempura as an appetizer. A little too greasy, but yummy (fried anything is pretty much a win, lol). I also ordered a litchi martini, which was tasty but nothing extraordinary. For my main, I ordered the shrimp pad Thai. Woosh, was it spicy! I have an average tolerance for spice, but I was not able to really eat my meal. I would have opted for mild spice, if asked. But other that that - the decor was pretty, and the location is prime!"}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture. Le dessert au chocolat était délicieux. Le canard aussi. Menu varié. Quelques oublis au niveau du service nous empêche de donner 5 *."}
{"text":"Went to kyozon for the first time for my friends' birthday party and her reservations were at 8pm but they didn't have our table ready until 8:30pm. I mean, if we were to have reservations at the restaurant, the least they could do is tell us 8:30pm instead of making us wait. Service was definitely slow and could have been a little faster.   The food was decent, it was nothing special.  I ordered the sobe sushi roll (honestly, I've had better sushi),  and the chicken pad Thai (not too bad).  What I liked most about the restaurant is the ambiance and the decor.  It looked very traditional Japanese style restaurant. Other than that, nothing too special.   Someone should also ask about the kaiten belt. So this is the belt that you can grab sushi off and then they charge you afterwards depending on the color of the plate and how many plates. I didn't have their kaiten belt, but I did ask a waitress about the belt and how they ensure the food safe of the food (so that it's not just rotating around for hours without a customer grabbing it) and she had no idea and made up some reason that did not make sense."}
{"text":"We walked into here with high hopes. I had read reviews of this place when it opened, and it seemed to be a promising establishment.  What I wasn't ready for, however, was one of the worst meals I have had in recent memory.  Three of us ordered the lunch Bento Box, and while I'll spare you the details, the gastrointestinal horror that followed is one for the books.  First and foremost, the food took 20+ minutes to arrive, which is amazing, considering that the only thing in the box that requires any form of real cooking would be the chicken or shrimp.  Lo and behold, a barebones bento box with our choice of sparse protein, a salad so tragic that Shakespeare himself could not have crafted it (several day old wilted lettuce, what seems like 3/4 wilted mint, and a few drops of dressing), sushi that you could get at a gas station, and extremely dry white rice.  My friend's chicken satay was nearly raw, and our shrimp was obviously drowned in garlic in order to mask the fact that the seafood was definitely not the freshest.  I cannot fault the server, as he was trying his best to accomodate us. That being said, he did mention that they were making huge changes in the kitchen and would be changing the menu shortly.  I would avoid this restaurant at all costs. I'm not one to say this, but this has to be the worst example of price-point I have ever seen. Know your lane and stick to it."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 5 stars based on the atmosphere and cleanliness, as well as the friendliness of the staff. But the food's horrible..."}
{"text":"On my first visit here, I met my friend on a friday at 4pm. We were the only people until about 20 mins. We were seated upstairs in a long booth which fits 6 people. I love booths, so I was pleased with our seating. There was no explanation about how the all you can eat sushi conveyor belt menu works. You turn on a red light with a switch attached to the wall in order to call your server. Once our waiter came to our table, he was surprised we were not given instructions. I had the geisha cocktail with lychees, it was flavorful. We opted to order straight from the complete menu since we were pressed for time. The food arrived in good time. Overall, I like the look of the space, great location, food and drinks were good. Suggestion would be to explain the sushi belt as clients are seated."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was near empty. Sat upstairs in a booth by the Kaiser belt. Was told it was $17 per person for all you can eat sushi plus a la care items. The food on the belt was good - not great - but found the food pretty boring and unimaginative. I know it's just sushi, but they didn't have a lot of variety. I would not return."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, great atmosphere and fabulous drinks. Order the champagne cocktail and the cod fish, won't regret it"}
{"text":"Really overpriced, 6 or 7$ for 4 gyozas made of beans. Took over an hour to be seated even with a reservation. Ran out of 2 of our dishes and didn't even bother to tell us. Took over 50 minutes to bring our food."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to have undergone a recent name change from Kyozon to L'Atelier D'Argentine (although the credit card receipt still shows Kyozon). This was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Highlights include the following:  1. Slow, inattentive service with very few customers there. 2.  Inedible food, bearing little resemblance to anything of any quality from Argentina. And 3. Dirty tableware.  The bottle of Malbec was good, if that was any consolation. Easily amongst my five worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"Samedi soir du grand prix... Une fille nous accoste pour nous dire de rentrer au Kyozon GRATUIT...et nous donne une carte et elles nous dit qu'on a un Free drink..yeah...  Mmm...pour être honnête on se cherchait une place vite fait pour faire pipi et prendre deux shots de Tequila donc on est rentré.. Bref...  Alors on rentre...le décor est super un peu vide pour le samedi du grand prix... Surtout que le show est fini sur Crescent...Après les toilettes on descends et on attends au bar pour du Tequila (qu'on s'avait très bien qu'on allait payer et qu'il n'allait pas être inclus dans le FREE DRINK de la promoteuse sur la rue...) et on attends......et on attends...et 15 minutes passent et on est partie...la fille à la porte nous à dit que c'était gratuit l'entrée(donc pas besoin de promoteuse pour rentrer..c'est NO COVER)...  Alors, on est aller rejoindre d'autres amis et une heure plus tard on repasse devant le Kyozon...Une autre fille nous dit Drink 2 for 1 drink 2 for 1... Et on lui explique qu'on a attendu une vingtaine de minute...elle nous dit que c'est bon il y a moins de monde et nous donne une place au bar...HAHAHAHA SURPRISE...20 MINUTES et rien...les barmaids qu'on a fait signe nous ont dit qu'elles servaient les commandes des serveurs...mais bon..avait-il une place caché? Car je ne sais pas trop où allait les verres.....Il y avait comme 4 bossboys...bref...personne pour nous servir :(  Dommage, car je n'ai même plus envie d'aller essayer cet endroit pour manger..."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dead. One of the dishes was way too salty. The Pad Thai was quite small but at least filing."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to commend the restaurant's concept/marketing. It's extremely well done. The internal decor finely attributed to a party bar restaurant on Crescent street. However, the quality of the food is near frozen pizza quality. I dined here twice, both times the quality of the food were disappointing. Yet, for the same price point, the restaurant next door could offer more variety with a higher quality of food.    Recommendations: *embrace izakaya atmosphere \"irashaismaseiiiii\" *greatly improve the quality of food, never keep food overnight  *Add more variety"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but this is one of the worst dining experiences I've had in very long time.   The experience started out nicely with a friendly hostess outside the restaurant greeting us while we were looking at the menu. We weren't sure, but then she told us about $2 oysters and that convinced us to give it a try.   The atmosphere is roomy, modern and trendy. So far so good. We ordered the oysters. They came and were dressed with grapefruit flavor sauce and salmon roe. They were fine.   The waiter tries to sell me a bottle of wine that I'm not familiar with, but when I asked for a taste, I was told no. This is the 1st time I've even had to ask, usually I'm offered a taste. Anyway, I'm not going to order a bottle of something I do not know. I was not offered any alternatives.   We then proceeded to order dinner. Asked for the eggplant salad. Not available. Bok choy. Not available. A little annoying when we are told that the last orders of these items have just been sold when we were the only table in the entire restaurant at prime dinner time (730ish).   So we went with a spicy tuna roll, miso cod, chili rice, and grilled asparagus. The roll came right away and it was horrible. It wasn't even made with sushi rice and the rice was sweet. There was way too much rice and very little filling so I can barely taste the fish. The roll was also uneven, the ends were smaller than the middle. If you're going to charge $15 for a basic roll, it should at least be done correctly.   Then about 30 minutes go by. Nothing happened. We then ask the waiter, how much longer for the rest to come? Food then suddenly comes out. The chili rice was swapped for fried rice. Not even what I ordered. Tasted a piece of the asparagus, which was cut into smaller pieces and placed on skewers. It was cold, mushy, and unflavorful. The cod was the thinnest piece of cod I've seen so I can't even see how it can be soft and flaky. The sauce was also dried up, probably from sitting out there for a while. We just sent everything back.    To sum up, bad food and bad service with an undeserving price tag. If you're hungry, go elsewhere. Not the worst place if you just want a couple of cocktails in a trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ayant entendu parlé du phénomène ''Kyozon'' depuis des mois, j'y suis finalement allé. Alors, un vendredi soir 5@7, très bel intérieur zen, design asiatique, j'ai beaucoup aimé le bar et l'aménagement. Je me assis au bar, mais où été les autres clients?  À peine 15 clients, dans le restaurant pour un vendredi soir, je me posais des questions...j'ai pris un cocktail + une bière...service ok du barmen....prix normaux...Je n'ai pas pris de bouffe... Pour ma part, j'ai bien aimé l'endroit mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi,  il n'y avait presque que personne ici, l'endroit est classe après de gros investissements financiers, prix cher ??? Mauvaises critiques culinaires....???"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, the atmosphere is spot on, but the food... small portions for the buffet and repetitive dishes."}
