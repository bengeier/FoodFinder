{"text":"Great place to eat. Stop by all time when in the area. The burgers n fries are great meal. I've eaten most of the menu there."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day made the order the way you like it at a fair price, the people couldn't be nicer. I go in at least twice weekly, you can know the good places to eat that all of the old regulars who are mostly farmers in the area that meet there every morning. Many different options, try to bring cash with you as they only accept it, however there is an ATM."}
{"text":"Been here twice on the way to the nearby wake park. The food is incredibly satisfying, very high quality diner-style food. The burgers are old-school awesome and gives the likes of Apache Burger (or other famous TO burger joints) a run for their money."}
{"text":"Stopped by for burgers. Nothing to complain about. Decent food. Got their North Burger and Greek Burger with two drinks for about $18. I would say 3.5 stars. Definitely not 4 stars though."}
