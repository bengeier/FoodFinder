{"text":"The folks at The Borough asked us to come back, and I'm glad we did! The service was very sweet and attentive, and the ventilation issues seem to be fixed. There are still a couple of kinks: the chef forgot to include my husband's sausage on his full English (not a euphemism), and my baked beans seemed a tad under-cooked (but I also prefer them really mushy, and most other people probably don't). Otherwise, things were fine! There was no lineup or wait, which was nice. I don't like having to shout just to carry on a conversation. And there was loads of coffee this time, too! I've already decided that next time, I'm trying the brunch burger. with a fried egg on top. Or maybe the Sunday lunch roast. Or the mac and cheese. Or, or, or..."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, great service and charming owners. The Borough has easily become our new dine-out spot in the East end.

My husband and I arrived on a snowy Saturday evening, the small restaurant was packed. We couldn't get a table but happily sat at the bar. 

We shared the mussels and fries and both got the salad. Husband ordered the trout and I got the roasted beets as my main. Everything was deliciously fresh! My husbands trout was huge. The salad had a smart combination of micro greens, yellow beets and goat cheese - super yummy. The mussels were fantastic! We didn't try the bread and just scooped the broth with a spoon. I'm a devoted beets fan so it's hard to mess that up, and they didn't.

Jason, the owner, came by to check in on us. To say he's obsessed with locally sourced food would be an understatement - it's the mantra of the restaurant and likely the reason behind their success. It's not always easy but it's amazing what grows in Ontario over the winter months."}
{"text":"My husband (a meat dude) LOVED it.  Not too much my thing, but it was tasty. The place needs to work on their ventilation system and fly problem. Classy joint.  Will try their mains next time."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at The Borough, a pub style gastro pup focused on local ingredients. Had an excellent evening starting with drinks at the bar while waiting for a table. Started with some mini Yorkshire puddings; beef was perfectly done, nice touch of horseradish and the arugula and extra pea shoots added a lovely freshness.  Our party of four enjoyed our individual mains; rainbow trout (daily special), Cornish hen, beef burger, and I had the porchetta special which had wonderfully crispy skin and was perfectly cooked. My sides of seasonal veg and new potatoes were excellent.  Shared their sticky toffee pudding to finish (they ran out of the deep fried apple pie); it was really good, but if pressed I would say it could use a little more toffee to pudding ratio.  All in all an excellent evening with friendly and attentive service. A welcome addition to East Danforth, and I look forward to many more meals here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and good food. They can discuss and pair beer quite well. Atmosphere was fine, if a little sterile for my taste. Food was very nice and, I would say, gourmet pub food. 

Nothing spectacular, but a great place to grab a beer and good interesting food, especially for the bangers and mash aficionado. It seems different local sausages are sourced weekly or more. Portions are smallish, but I am largish."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dinner here as I've only heard great things. But to be perfectly honest, it fell short of expectations. I had the beef wellington and it was okay. The beef itself wasn't as good as it could have been, but the potatoes were fantastic. My friends had the curry and the mushroom burger and neither were impressed. We agreed that the food felt like they were reheated leftovers. The sangria was fantastic though. Overall the experience wasn't so terrible that I wouldn't come back again. (though after one visit to each, I would say Morgan's down the street was far more impressive). But I'd like to give this place another try and revise my review based on a second visit."}
{"text":"Went for brunch last week. Superb and very friendly service. Generous portions and food was good. I would go again to try burger which is ranked in top 25 in Toronto Life magazine."}
{"text":"We arrived early due to the fact we had taken along my wife's grandmother. Nice looking establishment with a few pics of the old TTC streetcars shed on Danforth. A very nice local feel. Two thumbs up. The concept is \"local \" with a few Canadian exceptions ( PEI mussels , Arctic Char ) two thumbs up. They offer a selection of local Beers, Wines and Ciders. My wife had the Casa Dea Deas Curvee (Ontario sparkling wine) and I had the Duxbury Cider :) from Meaford, two thumbs up :)   For the stater we all decided to try the crab cakes. A wee bit under seasoned for myself but overall very nice and some tasty chunks of crab meat.   Next up was Beretta beef cheeks ( I am a mans man after all haha) and she who must be obeyed went with the Arctic Char ( she has a thing for Special boards and apparently so do I this evening).

OMG the cheeks were super super tender (Gordon Ramsey would be so proud of what they have done with a \"lesser\" cut of meat). Bravo!! Excellently complimented by asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. The dispatches in regards to the farm Arctic Char were equality superlative. Two thumbs up and three empty plate (including one for a tiny great grandmother ) says it all really !

Next up is desert - would be rude not too :) 
We settled on a hand crafted goat cheese cheese cake topped with the world famous Saskatoon berry super food. Lovely jubley. 

We finished up with some red rocket coffee and a Dillion's ( Ontario Gin) and tonic.  Very nice dining experience overall. Two thumbs up,"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly people. It was our first time here and we will definitely come back soon"}
{"text":"Small space and limited menu but excellent quality. Call and pick your timing. It is a tight room. Will be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went for dinner last night for his birthday.  I emailed the morning of the day before to make a reservation.  I got a confirmation email the next evening.  I asked for an end table since I'm about 8 months pregnant and I didn't want to struggle getting into a table.  When we arrived at 7:30pm, the restaurant was full except the table that was reserved for us.  We weren't able to get an end table but the guy made sure to give me extra room to get through.  The server we had was amazing, he was able to tell us about all the dishes and he gave the perfect balance of attention.  

We started with the duck wings with a sweet and hot sauce, it was the last order of the night so we ordered it right away.  To be honest I prefer chicken wings but it was definitely worth trying.  We then got the fries with buttermilk dill sauce.  I'm pretty sure the potatoes were white sweet potatoes with a nice crispy coating on them and the dip was delicious.  My husband got the duck breast special, it was perfectly cooked and the lentils and sweet potatoes mash it came on was delicious.  I ordered the Salmon special and again it was perfectly cooked (the middle/thickest part was slightly raw and delicious) and came with some nice roasted potato slices, beets and some other root vegetable.  When our meals originally came out I thought they looked a little small but I couldn't finish my dish, I had to give some to my hubby to finish off.  My hubby had two pints, both were very good and they were $6.50 each!

After tax and tip our meal came to $115.  All in all it was an amazing meal and we will definitely be back.  Welcome to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The Borough is 2 for 2 for us. It's a quaint little restaurant on a quiet strip of The Danforth. It doesn't boast an expansive menu, but what they do offer they do very well. Food comes out piping hot and the service is warm and friendly. 

We will definitely be back again and again until we've tried everything on the menu. It may take us awhile though since we keep getting sidetracked with their daily special offerings."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I was at this restaurant, our meal was ok, not as good as the last time, too many tomatoes and cheese in the daily salad, veggies and potatoes on main course too oily. I will give it a pass fir a while."}
{"text":"I have to say the staff was amazing. We went for summerlicious and arrived early the wait staff was wonderful and the chef recommended the mushrooms while we waited. Definitely awesome.  The food was very good and the sticky toffee pudding was incredible. The only downside was the temperature isthe restaurant, I'm not sure if the air conditioning wasn't working or they don't have it but it was uncomfortably hot inside especially sitting beside the kitchen. 
I will definitely go back in cooler weather"}
{"text":"Went to The Borough last night for the Sunday Roast and had a fabulous time! 
I indulged in the Roast Beef and Yorkshire Puddings (traditional Sunday fare in my household) and was not disappointed. The entire meal was mouth wateringly delicious! (and yes I just made up a word. It was that good!).   It had great local wines and good selection of beers on tap as well.  I loved the ambiance of it - very old school, meets new school.  The staff were also amazing, we met the chef and had a lovely conversation with our waitress. 

I would definitely recommend! A new gem in East York! 
Cant wait to go there for Brunch."}
{"text":"We went here for a family meal one Friday evening. We made a reservation for four as the Danforth tends to get busy on Friday evenings but when we walked in..it was dead, better for us as we were all pooched from the week and thus could use the peace and quiet. We decided to split some appetizers, the \"frites\" with dill sauce, and the beer and cheese crock. I also ordered the apple cider fizz to drink. Our drinks and food came in fairly quick succession so props on that. The drink was literally nothing to writer about, drinking a cider is no different then drinking this so.. eh..not really worth the $10 price tag. The frites were actually wedges, but came out piping hot and the dill sauce was DELICIOUS. The beer and cheese crock was just Meh, it was very salty (I know cheese is salty!), it was lacking something to cut the salty and fat. For mains I ordered the mushroom linguine, my husband ordered the special which was a pork pie with bacon, my sister the mac and cheese and my mom the burger. Everything came out plated very nicely, but my pasta was dull dull dull, it lacked seasoning and the fior de latte made for a super weird consistency. My husband initially enjoyed the pie but once digging in, it was dry towards the centre, the mac and cheese was a bit on the watery side. Again not horrible, but not great either. The bill over $150 for four of us, a bit high for the mediocre food we received. I love the concept of this restaurant and the service was warm and inviting, but the food just didn't stand up. With so many other places to eat on the Danforth, we are unlikely to return for awhile."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of one of the owners, I called and made a reservation a week in advance, why, because I am a celiac and wanted the mac n' cheese, allowing the chefs enough time and warning to prepare it safely for me. The dish was tremendously cheesy creamy delicious feel good(ness) and came with a small ramekin of the daily soup (which they also modified to accommodate a glutard diet). 

The Boroughs wine selection was all local Ontario and went down with far too much ease. 

The atmosphere was fairly chill with great soundscape background music. 

The kitchen dudes were super friendly and highly accommodating, they also dig happy meat. Thanks :D Totally will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlious. The food is very nice. I love their burger so much, they are not using the regular bun. Really worth a try. The customer service is great too. Just if they can fix the water leaking problem of the air conditioner outside the front door, that would be much better. Will definitely come again!:)"}
{"text":"The beef this place is really delicious. The service is fast and helpful. I would certainly come back"}
{"text":"We visited The Borough for brunch around 10:30am on a Sunday morning.  We called ahead to make sure there wasn't a wait and when we arrived 10 minutes later our group of 5 was promptly seated.  The servers were very friendly, competent and attentive - they made sure our water glasses were always full.  It would have been nice if the air conditioning was on in the restaurant - it was a very warm day and we were all sweating.  It also took about 30 minutes before we started to receive our food - the restaurant was about half full at this point.  
I ordered the Borough benedict which was a variation of the traditional eggs benny in which the base was a Yorkshire pudding.  The dish was executed quite well: home fries were crispy without being overly oily, the Hollandaise was creamy with a bit of tartness, and the Yorkshire pudding was a great alternative to an English muffin.  My gripe with the dish is that the eggs were not poached very well - when I cut into the egg the yolk was not runny at all."}
{"text":"A nice sparse but comfortable setting. Friendly service from Shane. Really enjoyed our food. We had the charcuterie plate, the children had the Amore pizza, very good. My wife's pizza very good. Mini Yorkshire definitely a winner. Added on a rib which was a good call and ended the night with the ice cream (delicious but a bit freezer burned), the chocolate chip shortbread was nice and the toffee pudding was excellent. Would definitely recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"Went to the Borough for Sunday Roast dinner. The wait staff (hi Sam) was very friendly and attentive.  Had a draught beer (Kings Pilsner) and started with the soup of the day (Sweet Potato Puree). Delicious start, decided on the Beef and wasn't disappointed, medium rare and tender with a red wine au jus. 

Roasted vegetables were crispy and carmalized perfectly and the Yorkshire Pudding brought back memories of Sunday dinners growing up. My only regret is I didn't have room for the dessert of sticky toffee pudding, though i sampled my dining companion's serving and was delighted. 

The Sunday dinner menu had all sorts of roast choices, including a vegetarian option.  I think I'll have the lamb next time.

{"text":"Great brunch spot!  Highly recommend it.  We tried the Full and Proper, Not so Full and the Eggs Florentine.  All were very good.  Very flavourful.  The fresh made Carrot and Beet juice was also surprisingly good.  

We had a sunny day and sat on the patio.  No better way to start the weekend."}
{"text":"It is very hard to give this place 2 stars I want to give one but one should be saved for the very worse. I just had a steak and mushroom pie that I wouldn't feed to my pet. Maybe three bites of steak and all crust. It is served more like a pizza pocket than a pie and it is laid on top of a mound of mashed potato's and no other vegetables. Can you say \"carb overload\"? I paid $25 for disappointment. Stay away, how these guys are open this long is beyond comprehension. This would be a good place for a Yelp event, they would be desperate enough to allow such an event."}
{"text":"The app platter was delicious. Main course had fried chicken sandwich which was pretty good but nothing to rave about. Wedges were perfect. The pie we got had no flavour, very bland and did not live up to its presentation."}
{"text":"We had not stumbled in here before, silly us. Your best bet on weekends is to make a resi. We had none, but were very early, so managed to grab seats at the bar. The place seats about 30. The food is mostly British in origin, but amped up and modernized. Everything we ordered was exceptionally yummy and the portions are generous. We started with The Board, two kinds of cheese, homemade sausage, pickled asparagus and other charcuterie items. I loved my cocktail, the East York New York (essentially a Manhattan). For mains I had the Borough Burger with fries (thick cut just like in Britain), and my better half had the special, a pie filled with meat and squash. Both dishes were large and fresh and unique. There is a good selection of beers on tap, and a limited but nice wine list. Lovely Syrah. Service is solid, and the place is hopping."}
{"text":"The first person to take you under her wing when you started at a shitty new high school in grade 10 invites you to her friend's restaurant and she's working so she can't sit with you but it's all good because the bartender keeps your glass full with the owner's excellent blonde ale and then one of the greatest songs of all time comes on (Umi Says by Mos Def) and you smile with your eyes as you bite into the house made IPA BBQ wings and mac and cheese and you're getting stuffed so you wrap it up to go and they give you some Yorkshire puddings and a Cornish hen leg for the road and you know it was worth the trip to the deep east side because now you have a delish lunch for tomorrow and you pray to that little Cornish hen in the sky that you don't forget it at the bar or on the subway because that would be a fucking bummer and a half."}
{"text":"We have been to the borough 4 or 5 times. We gave it a 4 stars on our previous review but we decided to give it a 5 after we visited again last night. The reason is that The Borough has been very consistently great every time!! We knew that their homemade meat pie is very tasty and meaty so we ordered the daily pie again and it didn't not disappoint us. I highly recommend everyone to give this restaurant a try. We order various dishes from appetizers to main, none of them have let us down so far. Food is more sophisticated and tastier than the Wren next door in my options."}
{"text":"They offer a prix fixe, which is really quite good. $35 lets you try out an app, sizeable main and a dessert!
Came here for a quick get together with friends. A friend and I split one prix fixe meal as neither of us wanted a full 3 courses. She had the chicken wings for the app, I got the mac and cheese which came with a soup. The soup was a roasted cauliflower. O-M-G it was soooooo creamy (due to goat cheese) and delicious. The mac and cheese was pretty good too, although I took leftovers home. We shared the creme brulee for dessert, which was yums! Definitely a nice spot to enjoy drinks or a meal and catch up with friends. Service was super helpful, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect and was blown away!! Had the brunch on Sunday. I went for a classic eggs bacon and hash browns and it exceeded any expectations I may have had. My partner had eggs Benedict that came in a yourkshire pudding with beans on the side. Also delicious. He is still talking about how good it was! We will go back for breakfast and I would love to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Halloween evening, but it was empty...and oh wow did we get the treatment! Homemade bread was amazing...apps terrific (yorkies and crab cakes), the main...we had to take some home, pork belly...mmmmm!  Dessert was delish, and we walked home as a result of our consumption.   Always an amazing meal!  Staff were fantastic! Felt quite spoiled!"}
{"text":"Not enough food!
We went today to this place since it had 4 stars, it is an amazing place, staff was really nice, the lunch menu did not have that many options, so we were already not impressed. When the food came in ohhh dear we just look at each other like \"where is the rest?\", one of my friend said that it was an Inappropriate serving size lol.
The food was bland, nothing amazing or worth the price! 
I don't know why this place has 4 stars. We were left hungry, we had to go somewhere else to eat. 
Never going to this place again!"}
{"text":"Good service very friendly staff. Food was awesome we had chicken and duck egg. Definitely would go again"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

We arrived at the very start of the dinner hour on a Saturday. We had our toddler with us so we planned to eat and flee as quickly as possible. 

First off, the service was amazing. Really attentive, lovely and upbeat. The restaurant was also kid-friendly without being too overtly family-oriented; my daughter was completely enamoured of our server. The space is cozy and has been nicely renovated with smaller tables and also some bar seating.

We started off with the smoked ham hock and pork belly terrine with tomato chutney and granary toast. This was rustic and really delicious.

For mains with went with the steak frites and the smoked beef ribs. Both were served with seasonal vegetables (brussels sprouts and root veggies) and thick cut fries and the portions were huge. So big in fact that my husband, despite his generally large appetite, had to ask for a doggie bag. Both main were really, really good.

The food was fantastic and I love that the folks at The Borough tweet out their daily specials. This is probably my new favourite place in the 'hood for a nice meal.

They also have a nice selection of craft beers and local wines. The only thing holding me back from giving them a full 5 star rating is the cocktails. Oh the cocktails...they looked so interesting in their descriptions but sadly just weren't well balanced in their execution. We tried 3-4 different ones and they all seemed to be this way. Definitely won't stop me from eating here however; I'll just stick to wine or beer with my meal. :)"}
{"text":"This is a place not to be missed on Danforth Ave. A pal and I checked this place on a whim after a few other restaurants we were eyeing was closed.

In fact this place looked closed initially as well but that was not the case. Their menu is primarily based on specials but they do have some staples that are available all the time. However, a menu change is coming within the next month (according to the chef).

They have a moderate amount of seating with enough space between tables that you don't feel crowded.

What I love about the restaurant is they emphasize local produce and protein. One of the first things I observed was that they promoted the local farms where the protein was procured on a chalkboard above the kitchen. That gave them bonus points in my book. 

We both had their Mac'n'cheese accompanied by Acorn squash soup. Both were gourmet and delicious. The love of food that the chef puts into each dish was evident. Even the greens that decorated the Mac n cheese were crunchy and fresh.

For dessert, we shared one of their 'cookies and milk' a little taste of childhood for adults. I described it as a little piece of heaven, my friend said it sent shivers down his spine. The staff were even talking about how they love that dessert.

Even the drinks are locally sourced. As they serve the Pop Shoppe from Burlington.

This is a place not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Fritatta that will make your day. Very friendly servers to boot. And the patio is lovely, lots of sun."}
{"text":"Impressed with the food selection and courteous staff.  Will definitely return!  Great beer selections too."}
{"text":"great new restaurant in the danforth east neighbourhood. glad to see these new places opening up in the east end. i've eaten here many times with friends and the food is great. i find GOOD british food isn't very common in toronto. this place is awesome. good local beer selection too. don't leave without trying the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Update:  After the bad experience we had, the owner personally invited us back.  That was very nice, so we gave Borough another try, and I'm happy we did.  Food was great, delicious actually.  Nice addition to the neighbourhood.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Ok -  had the Sunday roast beef with mashed potatoes, parsnip fries, and Yorkshire pudding. Everything was good. Atmosphere was so so and there was only one other table so the server did what he needed to do.  No real compelling reason to return."}
{"text":"Went to The Borough last night while we were doing a bit of a snacking tour of The Danforth. The place and signage outside is a little unassuming, but the inside is quite nice and inviting.

While we were there I saw quite a few families with kids, so its quite family friendly. But at the same time they have a bar area and a high table which we were seated at. So definitely a place you could grab a drink as well.

The special Saturday was ribs, so we split a full rack dinner. The ribs were tender and you could easily tear the bones off the meat with your hand. The fries and coleslaw were great too. The fries were thick cut and very soft in the middle with a nice exterior. The coleslaw was crisp and light. It was flavourful without being drenched in oil and vinegar.

On top of the food hitting the mark, the beer selection was quite good. I had the Left Field Brown Ale, and I'd have it again. It was great! They also told us that Left Field is opening a brewery right close by. Excellent.

The service was friendly and attentive, and they didn't even blink an eye when my crazy friend asked for 6 empty cups. (To split beers). I'd go there again, and I'd recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Brunch is great! I get so confused because there are line ups at places half as good as The Borough and we can usually walk right in here. All the options I've had have been good, and the price reasonable. One of the best along Danforth in my opinion. Dinner has been a little less consistent, but still worth checking out."}
{"text":"Gave this place 5 stars previously a few months after it opened. Said it was great food. Good beer on tap. And very family friendly. $5 kid meals as well as toys and puzzles for the kids. 

Have been quite a few times since and place still good and owner is a great guy but docking a star today. Went there at 640 w family of 4 on a Saturday after being out for the day and there were two empty tables (table for 4 and table for 2) and another table of 4 finishing their meal. Initially told there was room so we came in and started to seat everyone but I was then told they had nothing available for us as they had a reservation for 4 people due soon. Fair enough I guess but I was also told that the ppl who made the reservation were running late and likely not going to arrive for another 30-45 mins. They offered us a table outside but it's not the best place to eat next to busy Danforth (with 2 little kids) so took a pass. 

I also didn't quite understand how they could not find a table for us esp with 2 empty tables and another table of 4 finishing up. We likely wouldn't have been longer than 45 mins anyway as we know what to order and don't like to take too long w kids. And even if we were and the table that was finishing up took another 45 mins or so (which would be unlikely) it seems to me that when people are running that late on a reservation they have to expect that they may lose the privilege of being seated right away. Whole thing was bizarre. We will be back as perhaps it was just an off night or just some bad math by the manager but lesson learned: don't drop by if you don't have a reservation!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I was disappointed, though, that there weren't better vegetarian brunch options. Other than that, the atmosphere was nice, they had a big table for our large group, and the service was friendly.

As an update to my review, I just got back from dinner at The Borough with my family and we each were really pleased with our meals. The risotto was amazing! The best I've had. My partner had the \"Oh my cod\" and my dad the curry, and they both highly recommended them."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday dinner....we went right after it opened so it was fairly quiet.  Service was good.

I had the crab cake and beef roast.  The crab cake was ok but the beef roast was not good.  The dish was way too salty and the beef was tough /overcooked.  I also had a cucumber cocktail which was good.

I might go back to try the regular menu...it is limited on Sundays."}
{"text":"Visited The Borough, a Gastropub on Danforth for Summerlicious ($28 per person). The Borough is a cosy pub with a British flare. The owner is friendly with a passion for local sustainable food! The Borough prides itself in using local ingredients to create a seasonal menu.

Appetizer:
Crab Cakes Deep fried crab cakes 
Crab cakes topped with spicy aioli and a carrot coleslaw. Crab in the crab cakes is not very pronounced. Carrot coleslaw added a hint of lightness to the heavy crab cakes and aioli. It was a decent disk. 

IPA Chicken Wings Free range chicken wings
The Borough has a board with information on the farm in which its produce originated from. It's great learning more about local farmers in Ontario. Chicken Wings were deep fried and tossed in the IPA barbecue sauce. These were served with a local blue cheese dressing. While my companion and I did not enjoy the blue cheese dressing, we both enjoyed the wings. The wings were crisp, the barbecue sauce was flavorful. 

Entree:
Chicken Cordon Borough 
Aged cheddar and double smoked bacon stuffed chicken breast on roasted garlic mashed potatoes, served with roasted heirloom carrots and a garlic cheddar cream sauce was delicious. However, at this point, after all the fried appetizers, we felt it was very heavy. The rich in fat bacon, thick cheese sauces, starchy mash potato was comforting, yet very substantial. 

Pearl Barley Risotto 
Pearl Barley Risotto with seasonal vegetables in a creamy barley risotto, topped with a sunny side up quail egg was again a  gratifying dish. It was however, also heavy. Richness of the creamy sauce and oil weights down the dish. 

Dessert:
Sticky Toffee Pudding 
Classic sticky toffee pudding served in a rich toffee sauce, needless to say, was again rich and heavy. It was named the best toffee pudding in town, indeed it was. It was warm, decadent and a satisfying way to end the meal. 

Dessert of the day - Pear rose pastry
Essentially, it tasted like a cinnamon roll with pear. We both felt it was not as delicious as it sounded on paper and did not finish the dessert.

Overall, our meal at The Borough was deeply satisfying. I felt bloated and have likely gained 10-lb after indulging in this gluttonous meal."}
{"text":"Went to this place for this first time for Sunday roast dinner and was not disappointed!

me: prime rib roast dinner- beef was perfect, roast veg amazing, potatoes perfect and au jus tasty.  I think some green peas would have been nice, but only to make me feel like I was eating more veg.

GF: Steak and mushroom pie on top of mash- pie was excellent, tasty, nice red wine glazed.  the mash potatoes were kind of bland (But hey, isn't that the hallmark of my home country- bland cooking?!  Heh)

We shared the very rich and decadent Sticky Toffee Pudding, perfect end to a good meal.
