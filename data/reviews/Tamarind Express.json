{"text":"The menu is getting bad each week especially the veg once. Also, they have started skimping on the quantity now.  If this continues, I won't be coming back here for lunch anymore."}
{"text":"Tamarind Express is a hidden gem.  The appearance is unassuming and basic, but the food is top notch.  If you work in this area you need to go in and give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting concept.  Not exactly a restaurant, but more of a catered meal served to go, or to eat in a large hall with tables and chairs.  Offering a choice of platters to include Vegetarian, Non-vegetarian, and Briyani (the latter doesn't include Naan bread).  Since this was the first week, they were also offering a complimentary dessert (I believe it was Almond Kulfi, a sweet pudding).  The platters come in a take-out styrofoam container, and are served with plastic cutlery.  Bottled water is available to purchase for an additional dollar.  I had the veg. platter, and I thought the food was tasty, and I had a plentiful sufficiency to eat.  I noticed that the non-veg choices included some varieties of chicken, but there may have been other choices also.  This seems like a good option for the business people of Southpointe for a quick lunch."}
