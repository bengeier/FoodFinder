{"text":"Love this place, run by a 50 something greek couple. Portions are fair, great service. Bacon and eggs for 2x is around $20. Try the porridge too!  Interior is clearly 60s inspired. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday morning and got the chicken breast and eggs breakfast. They were pretty good and service was fast. About 2 hours after finishing the meal, I started feeling queesy and throwing up about an hour after that. After I threw up all the breakfast I felt so much better, which shows that it was food poisoning.   This followed by a fever an hour later and I went to the doctor. The doctor confirmed that it was food poisoning from that meal.   I called the restaurant this morning to let them know and as soon as I told them that I got sick after eating their food, the lady started rambling about how it could have been a meal that I ate the day before, and how I was cheap and didn't want to pay the bill. I said I would be sending in a food inspector to which her response was \"I don't care. I'm too old for this and you can do what you want.\""}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst. I cannot even verbalize how terrible this place is. I just don't understand how anyone can honestly enjoy this restaurant. I've really tried to like it, I've been 4 times! But every time I'm grossly disappointed. Their fish & chips were absolute trash. Both the fish and fries were dry, cold and tasted old. Their bacon and eggs breakfast is a joke. The bacon is so thin I can literally see through it! I tried pork chops and a salad for lunch once, and the pork chops were thin and dry. And the salad was soggy! The fourth time I went I just stopped to get a coffee and a Banana muffin.... I might as well have drank used car oil and a sawdust muffin. To top it all off, the pricing is RIDICULOUS! My bacon and egg breakfast cost $17! The muffin and coffee were like $5.00! My fish and chips was almost $30! WTF!!!?.... How can anyone justify such crazy pricing for such terrible quality!? I know your going to ask why I would have been so stupid to go 4 times. I have a few co-workers that frequent the place for some unknown reason, and I tried to like it for sake of camaraderie. Now I just tell them, \"Sorry, I'd rather starve\"."}
{"text":"My family & friends eat here regularly & we've been coming here for years. The food is solid & the portion size is more then fair. The owners treat us like rock stars & always prepare our food exactly how we like it. Breakfast for 3 ppl is $35.00 inc tip. We've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. This is a \"recommend\" from me."}
