{"text":"Great Mexican style hot dogs at a great price! I usually don't eat from food trucks but I couldn't pass this place up! I was a little confused when I arrived because I wasn't sure if they had different styles of hot dogs.. I requested 3 hot dogs (2 for my husband and 1 for myself) to go. They served all toppings on the side so when I got home my hot dogs were nice and warm and the bread was delicious! Based on the quality/taste of their food this place gets a 5!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, it's not often that I indulge, but when I get a hankering for a mexi hotdog...Nogales is it! Always incredible service, they are supper sweet and remember your face!!! I brought a friend that had gone a year from not eating meat after breast cancer(she came in from St. Louis) and she wanted to experience a mexican hot dog....SHE ATE 2....she loved them...as I love them.....I also love watching them erect their stand everyday on my drive home from work....what a great local spot..."}
{"text":"I don't like hog dogs but these are bomb!!! And walking distance from me  ....yeeaaaaaa"}
{"text":"These hot dogs are good, but they are always late setting up. This is the second time I have been here with the same problem, I arrived at 7 p.m & nobody was outside in the parking lot. I came back at 7:38 & they are barely setting up & said that it'll be 15 minutes more until they will be ready. Something they reaaaaaally have to work on."}
{"text":"by far one of the best hot dogs I've ever tasted, love the buns, really yummy..."}
{"text":"Something I never would have thought I would have had the chance to experience. But I'm so glad I did. These are best after a good night of drinking."}
{"text":"Great little hot dog and interesting place to eat it. I have taken them home also and their great. It's a small hot dog in my opinion and if you don't like your bacon under cooked it may not be for you. I like my bacon cooked good. Overall fun and reasonable hot dog."}
{"text":"A sweet bread with bacon wrapped hot dog came loaded with pinto beans, mayo, tomatoes and onions then you can go to the concession stand and add guacamole, mushrooms, salsa, cheese/mexican cheese, and then you finish with a mexican coke in the bottle...  You get greated as you walk up, place your order and have a seat while the cook using plastic gloves put together your food. The place is kept clean and they wipe the tables down with a chlorax solution after you are done. it is well lit for a couple pop up tents and even have a tv showing mexican soaps...  We also left with a cup of champurrado..."}
{"text":"Round 2 was just as awesome!!!  Tried their specialty The Nogales Hot Dog and it was great! Almost torta like dough for the bun, nice char dog under a salsa of sorts! Tacos cabeza and legua! Nice and tender with great flavor!! This local spot is fantastic   Be mindful of the hours!!!  Doing my best here to remember.  Monday-Thursday 7pm-12:30am Friday 7pm-2am  Saturday 8am-2am Sunday 8am-12am  This is a food truck for the new folks!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid three stars, almost four (I bumped for the hours!). I popped in here a few weeks ago to get some much needed protein before boozing it up. If you're going to ingest a plate full of fat, this is a really great way to do it. Bacon wrapped hotdogs slathered with mayo and tied together with what has to be the most amazing \"bun\" I've ever had. I took mine with the beans and tomatoes, hold the onions, and slopped on as much of the green salsa as I could. The dog was gone in about 30 seconds. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I've been trying for over a month to try one of their Sonoran hot dogs. Every time I've driven by they aren't there.  Does anyone know if their still in business or have they changed locations?"}
{"text":"Food was so damn good make you wanna slap your mama!! Lol I got food for the family and the burgers are good my daughter loved her cheese fries and the hot dogs were amazing and the burrito was smaller than filibertos but so much more better as far as taste. My only complaint would be about the quesdilla they were small and definitely not worth the money buy overall a 5 and will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Rare, 5 star banner.  They so deserve it!  Good food, no fuss, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for well over 5 years. The description by Lu G of the hot dogs is spot on and the location info by Jody K is accurate. Look for a yellow colored tent, across from the McD's and batting cages. Every once in a while they'll get my order wrong (no jalapeno's on the nachos, or the wrong type of tortilla) so check your order before you leave (if you're getting take out)."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. Nogales is actually a van and a grill in a parking lot, not a restaurant. They have only one hotdogs to choose from, but supply a few extra optional toppings.  Hot dogs are $3 and well worth it"}
{"text":"Those of us from Detroit swear their Coney Dig is the best but the two women at Nogales Dogs have converted me.  Found this on Yelp as late night place and tried it tonight. Had dog with everything then you go to the cooler and there is two types of cheese jalape√±o peppers guacamole and more guacamole ( I went back for more).  Interestingly there was also a tray of sliced mushrooms that I added to this treat. What a taste treat with a nice soft bun.   Also had a sangria soft drink which was a new treat.   DON'T let the fact it is not a building stop you !!   Best place to enjoy good food with nice people.   Recommend."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran style dogs! Fresh fixings and super fast friendly service. Give it a shot even if your guerito like me. Trust me, I'm a hot dog conessiuer from Chicago and lived in Mexico! I live in the perfect spot, Sonoran-style at 20th St. & Indian School and Chicago-Style at 38th St. & Indian School!"}
{"text":"Love their dogs. No matter rain or shine they are open. Flavorful n hot. Add your choice of toppings and enjoy"}
{"text":"Appearing only after sunset in the parking lot of a tire shop or other similar establishment, Sonoran Hot Dog Food Trucks are an awesome thing to catch, especially late at night when the other normal options would be greasy Mexican or diner food. Try to figure out their schedule, though, because it's not an every-day or all-day thing."}
{"text":"A hidden neighborhood gem. Great food truck serving Nogales style Mexican street food. Everything from a hot dog to street tacos and French fries. Open late. I get carne asada street tacos. Nothing fancy about this place but if you're in the mood for some good ole' Mexican food with a splash of heart and soul this is the place."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect. But believe me, these hot dogs are the bomb! They load them with beans and onions. You can add cheese, peppers and some other condiments to suit your taste.  Really great food truck dining!"}
{"text":"If you found a way to make hotdogs out of crack, and then to sell them to willing junkies such as myself, at 12:30 at night on a street corner in not the best part of Phoenix, you'd have Nogales Hot Dogs.  These hotdogs call out to me at night in a sweet Mexican Siren song, lulling me from deep slumbers warm in my bed to venture out into the night on my bicycle on some clandestine hotdog run during the hours that the rest of you poor saps sleep.  And while you sleep, let me tell you, you have no idea what your passive slumber is allowing you to miss. If these were crack, by now I would have smoked my damn knee caps off like Whitney and Bobby did before she decided to make a new movie called \"Lifeguard.\"  So, soooooo good. Bring cash-e-money. Bring a little time. Bring a sense of adventure and a desire to gawk at the interesting that the intersection Indian School and 19th St can bring late at night. Sit down, enjoy the spectacle. Maybe come after an evening over serving yourself at Shady's or Chopper John's down the street.  This place is a very rare ultra late night gem in Phoenix. Come support them so they can keep singing that devil's song that lures me from my bed to go indulge in pork products during the wee hours of the night."}
{"text":"This is a roach coach straight from heaven ;).  You Will feel like you just drove 3 1/2 hours to Rocky point.  Hotdogs and tacos"}
{"text":"Great Taste, great service!! I love those wrapped bacon hot dogs!!"}
{"text":"\"Service is good, food is very decent (not the best Sonoran Dog I've ever had but still very good), and price is right.\""}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the Sonoran Dogs here!!!! The bread feels like you are biting into a cloud!! Best one in town in my opinion! The owner Pablo is always friendly and ready to take your orders and if you are in a rush you can take it to go!"}
{"text":"Get it dressed! It comes with sour cream, beans, tomatoes, and onions (and of course the bun and dog). Now, normally, I refuse to eat sour cream, beans, or tomatoes but after tasting one bite of this dog I was converted. Everything worked together like a symphony and was absolutely delicious. Come try one!"}
{"text":"It's such a disappointment that a hot dog wrapped in bacon can lack flavor. Buns taste like old stale bread. A teaspoon of beans and tomatoes (not pico) how dare anyone call this a Sonoran dog!  A complete overload of mayo. Not even warm when eating! Please go to Tucson and take cooking classes."}
{"text":"Today I'm having a regular dog and a Sonora dog Great dogs and great service You have to come try this place it is totally different"}
{"text":"I was disappointed after reading all the great reviews.  Here's the good and the bad:  Good: the bun was terrific!  soft, chewy, and very bready.  Loved it.  Not so good: the hot dog itself was so-so.  No better than your typical vienna dog you would get at any hot dog stand.  Wrapped in bacon?  Not that I could tell.  I didn't taste bacon at all.  If you get the works - you better like mayonnaise.  It overwhelmed the flavors of just about everything else.  So why 3 stars?  My two companions loved theirs.  Also, the service was really good and they did have lots of toppings to try.  Next time I will skip the mayo, ask for double bacon, and try my own toppings.  Also - this was the first hot dog stand I've been to where they didn't ask to be paid when they handed you the food.  It was more like a restaurant experience and that was nice."}
{"text":"Nogales offers a standard Sonoran Hot Dog.  They're cooked up on a cart located at 20th St and Indian School (across the street from 7Eleven).  One plus over other Sonoran dog carts in they let you put your own toppings on.  This provides the customer the perfect opportunity to dress up their dogs to taste.  It's given to you with covered with pinto beans, diced tomatoes and mayo.  The rest is up to you.  I did get buns that were on the stale side the other night but I think it was just dumb luck.  Just read the other reviews and it's easy to see this is a quality cart.  An imperfect dog will slip thru from time to time.  Even with the inferior buns this was still one tasty dog.    Wash your Nogales dog down with a Mexican Coke.  It's a perfect pairing."}
{"text":"The best Sonoran hotdogs in Phoenix.  It's a great hot stand. Great comfort or hang over food!"}
{"text":"SO SIMPLE, & SO DELICIOUS!  (ZERO AMBIANCE!)   A Street Vendor & Only One Item On This Menu: Hot Dogs Soaked With Bacon, & on the side there is Guacamole, Cream Cheese, Beans, & Several Salsas to choose from! Followed by a Mexican bottled Coca-Cola; the glass bottle & the cane sugar makes a huge difference in taste!  That's it!"}
{"text":"I'm a self proclaimed hot dog lover and if you are too Nogales is the place for you.  I've never had a sonoran hot dog before, so I have to admit I have nothing to compare to.  But, WOW I am now a fan.  Who would think mayonnaise and bacon on a hot dog sounds good, maybe that's the reason it took me 2 years of living in AZ before I ventured out to try one of  these local favorites.  The price $2.75 is great and talk about the toppings to choose from- onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, cojita cheese, cheddar cheese, guacamole, salsa verde, and mayonnaise all on top of that yummy bacon wrapped grilled hot dog.  My only regret is that I didn't order 2.   I've found since my first trip there I've been looking for reasons to be at Keyboard City at 6pm.   Definetly a must try for the hot dog lover or that foodie who's looking for something new to try.  Check out the picture and I dare you not to run to your car to get yourself one tonight."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I always stop at Nogales Hot Dogs for a sonoran dog!"}
{"text":"Paying $3 for $.50 hotdogs on cheap buns I don't get why people are giving more than one star. I'm totes confused. Don't really know what else to talk about. It's a cheap hotdog they overprice..."}
{"text":"Super delicious!!!! It has not been easy to find a proper Sonoran dog that is common to the Tucson area. This place nailed it!!!    This isn't exactly a food truck but more of a cart. The ladies working were super quick and very friendly.  It makes me a little sad that they open at 7pm but the food is so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs. True Sonoran hot dogs, fresh ingredients, friendly service. They have the mexican coca colas and lots of more. Really  this place. Ohh and on winter they serve champurrado"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fast and delicious! They have pickled jalapenos, salsa, and cheese if you want other accoutrements."}
{"text":"At $3.25 per hot dog, these aren't the best hot dogs I've had. When you ask for everything, it comes with pico de gallo (tomatoe and onions), sausage, mayo, bacon, and beans. It was good but it was missing flavor. I had to put 2 types of hot sauces to give it extra flavor. Don't think of putting ketchup on these as it is not customary to do so in Sonora (Nogales is city that borders Sonora and Arizona). Make sure you always, I repeat, ALWAYS accompany with a bottled coke."}
{"text":"Authentic, unique, delicious, and affordable. These hot dogs are bacon wrapped in a delicious roll. They come with pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, and a special creama sauce. Then you can add Parmesan cheese, orange cheese, mushrooms, jalape√±o, green chili salsa, or a special green sauce. The photos do not do justice to the pleasure you will experience enjoying a Nogales Hot Dog. This hot dog stand is an experience in culinary delight."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you come across a nice little gem somewhere, and then stuff your fatass with it? Yeah, I did that.   I've been passing this place for years, and I finally decided I wanted hot dogs with my girlfriend. So we hopped on yelp and found this, low and behold, it's the place I've been passing for years and never stopped by. Turned out to be some damn good hot dogs, and good prices. So after my first hot dog, I decided to get another couple medio litros of Coke, and 5 more hot dogs, and then finish off what was left of my girlfriends 2nd or 3rd hot dog.   The people who run that little stand are nice people and really friendly, I like them and their dogs of hot. Next time I crave a hot dog that hits the spot, I'll be barreling into that small parking lot with purpose.   That Kobayashi guy (or whatever his name was) that ate 52 cow brains in the glutton bowl ain't got shit on me."}
{"text":"Delicious Sonoran hotdogs! They're wrapped in bacon and topped with mayo, onions, tomatoes, and beans. Plus you can add peppers, mushrooms, hot sauce, cheese, or guacamole. They're always parked in the comic book store parking lot at the corner of Indian School and 20th street. Friendly service. Yummy comfort food. I'm from Michigan and while chili dogs are still my favorite, Nogales hot dogs are definitely in 2nd place :-)"}
{"text":"so I finally got to experience the Nogales Hot Dog stand and what  treat. I took my son on his first, of hopefully many, food adventures. I ordered the dog with everything and added some guac, cotijo and hot sauce. What a great little spot to get a late night snack. For $2.75 a piece, you just can't beat it."}
{"text":"I have to add an enthusiastic thumbs-up to the Nogales Hot Dogs experience.  I was incredibly lucky, as I pulled into the parking lot around 6:30 on a Sunday night (note: Keyboard City isn't even there anymore) and saw nothing, yet just as I was leaving in defeat, the van came in.  15 minutes later, the whole operation was set up and it made me gape in awe. I expected a small window, not a fully set-up seating area with tables, chairs, a condiment bar, etc.  I felt bad about asking them not to top the first one with \"everything\", which they did anyway. It was AWESOME with everything (which means beans, tomatoes, onions, and mayo). They add those condiments for you, while the others (cheddar cheese, powdery \"cotija\" cheese, guacamole, mushrooms, and a very good and potent green tomatillo salsa) are part of the condiment bar.  15 minutes later, I emerge from my car and ask for another. The guy who runs the place gives me a knowing smile that says it all: \"We've heard that before\".  I wish there was something like this in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Ever since eating these tasty \"Sonoran Hot Dogs\" in Tucson I've become obsessed with finding more of 'em.  See my reviews in Tucson.  ODE TO THE SONORAN HOT DOG: Ahhhh the Sonoran Hot Dog you are so much better than the Chicago Hot Dog, and the Coney Island Hot Dog, and the Chili-Cheese-Bacon-Dog.  With your sweet bun and wiener wrapped in bacon , you entice the Mexican inspired toppings of beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sauces and onions.  Your condiments are plentiful and overflowing.  I enjoy you with a Mexican Soda, the way a soda should be sipped.... from a GLASS BOTTLE. I adore you Sonoran Hot Dog.  As you can see, I'm a fan of these hot dogs.  Nogales Hot Dogs in Phoenix is a decent, roadside stand located in a parking lot. I imagine this to be reminiscent of a REAL Nogales Hot Dog purchased from a street vendor. The Dog is okay, and the place gets an extra star for being a roadside stand. My kind of joint. The bacon was a bit puny.  But when you're in Tucson, make sure you visit both El Guero Canelo  and BK Hot Dogs. (Again, see reviews). Those dogs are truly inspiring. Nogales Hot Dogs are a nice runner up, but nothing too amazing. But since they're the only Sonoran Hot Dogs in the Valley of The Sun, we will have to enjoy them too.  Just don't forget to go to Tucson and get them there on your next trip to the Old Pueblo. Then you'll know why I'm so \"inspired\".   Thanks Nogales Hot Dogs for taking care of my Sonoran Dog obsession."}
{"text":"If you get the late night munchies Nogales is your destination. They have a few tables so it can get crowded at times but I believe worth the wait. If you are not a H dog lover then it's not the place for you. All the Mexican hotdog toppings are provided with some tasty home made salsa. The ladies are quick and friendly so service is great. Simple, easy, clean and fast is what a late night snack shack is about."}
{"text":"The buns. The goddam buns. I know, I'm going crazy about the buns instead of what goes between them, but they're the best I've ever had in my life. They're not just soulless edible meat and condiments holders. They're puffy little golden brown baked happiness. Slightly sweet and soft to the touch.   I would be at this spot every week if they'd let me buy a bag of bread from them. I'd have bread breath all the time and a bulging bread belly and wouldn't even care.   Now about the stuff inside the bun. I like my dog with bacon, mayo, Mexican cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, and guacamole."}
{"text":"My favorite taco joint ever! They offer traditional pastor, asada, cabeza and veggie options but for me it's the seasoning of said meats that seals the deal ... not sure what it is but it is addicting. The salsa is nice and tangy with a bit of heat.   Bet you can't have just one :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by with my girlfriends for a midnight snack!! We loved it!!! Even our friend who didn't want meat loved her beans in the bun with all the toppings!  Would definitely come back. Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of good Sonoran hotdog places east of central so I am excited to report that there is finally a place that you don't have to travel all the way to the west side of Phoenix to get a good Sonoran style hotdog.  The buns are fresh and soft and surprisingly, the toppings are more abundant then  the typical cart I find in Tucson. And you can't beat the hours. They also take cards. Two dogs and two jarritos = $11"}
{"text":"Fantastic hot dogs. Super cheap, and very nice people. A must do in Phoenix."}
{"text":"While Chicago-style dogs are more my flavor... I had to give Nogales a fair chance. I mean... what ISN'T appetizing about eating cheap Mexican weiners sold on dirty Phoenix parking lot?!  The stand is set up on the corner of  SW corner of 19th st and Indian School in front of a guitar store, so it was easy to find. I think by 6 pm is when the owner and his wife start setting up.  Being that it was my first time, they were very nice when I asked them how I should eat it. This bacon-wrapped, slim hotdog could be topped with anything, onions, beans, mayonnaise, green avocado (i think) dip, salsa... it was dark out so I couldn't really see what I was putting on my hotdog, all I know was that it was getting very heavy and soggy by now.  At first bite, it was exactly what I thought it would be... a bacon-wrapped hot dog with onions, beans, etc. Nothing extraordinary.  It was definitely refreshing washing it down with a Mexican coke though. I finished my hot dog fairly quick and felt like I wanted another but resisted the temptation.   So for less than $5 you can get yourself a Nogales hotdog with a Mexican coke but at least you can tell everyone that you ate Mexican wieners on dirty corner somewhere in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada tacos & Sonoran hotdogs!! This is food truck and I believe they do not setup until 6:30pm on weeknights so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"Really legit Sonoran hot dogs. Good lighting, nice environment. Loved them! I will be returning soon for sure. The big plus was that we could pay with card! Awesome!"}
{"text":"I am a hot dog lover.   For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite."}
{"text":"Good place to get Sonoran hot dogs. They are pretty tasty and come with lots of optional toppings. Definitely use the toppings, load it up for the best experience. It's served on a unique bun. Small place with outdoor seating. There are many regulars there. Inexpensive."}
{"text":"This place is like a must visit every time I come to Arizona. I'm assuming the original Nogales Hot Dogs purchased a food truck and uses this location as one of its stops. This place never fails to satisfy me.   They have this big cooler of three assortments of hot sauces, along with cheese, mushrooms, onions, and chili pepper condiments. The tacos are a fair size, though I had four to myself. The hot dogs aren't Costco sized, but with all the toppings in it made it sufficient. I don't know their hours, but it's always around at night when I swing by."}
{"text":"This place is the only place I've found in Phoenix where I can get a champurrado fix.  And they've got great loaded hot dogs, too.  The owners are very sweet and attentive, and they'll bend over backwards to make sure you've got everything you need, particularly if you're getting your dogs to go.  Who knew parking lot food could be so great?"}
{"text":"Five stars for The staff and ambiance, Two stars for hot dog....  It is good for a quck street dog."}
{"text":"Big thumbs up! Best place to get a Sonoran dog! Great prices, friendly service, long time established. Good people run this place, plus it's kind of nice to eat outdoors late at night in phoenix too."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when you walk back to your car and think, \"I could eat about ten more.\"  Great bacon-wrapped hot dogs, great bolillos.  Mayo, beans, tomato.  Order it with everything on it.  Dress your own dogs and grab a bottle of Coke.  Well worth the visit on any evening."}
{"text":"I'm  constantly here I love it. Service is great. We usually get our food quickly unless it is busy. Just wish they would open earlier."}
{"text":"I have gone to that location at least 3 times and different times and it does not exist. This may be an old listing."}
{"text":"The first time I had Nogales, it was amazing. The next time, it was still good but not as great as I remembered. Maybe it's better when you're drunk.  Maybe I realized the second time that the dog itself was pretty small.  The toppings add a unique flavor. I wish the bacon was more crispy and that it stood out more. $3 per dog."}
{"text":"I stopped at this stand one late weekend night coz i read about it from Megan McCain's tweet about this sonora hot dog creation. So when I was in the area around 20th st and Indian School, I paid the place a visit. I don't usually carry cash with me, I'm the plastic fiend. This time I salvaged cash laying around my car, and was able to find enough cashola for one hot dog which was like $3.25.  The hot dog comes with additions of jalapenos, mayo, salsa, pico, beans, and bacon. It's messy and has an interesting flavor. This is the kind of food that you need to park and eat or sit at one of the tables by the stand and enjoy your hot dog. Also ask for extra napkins. Overall, it's an alright dog, something that I'd try again but not an absolute... gimme a burrito any night!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I love the hot dogs with everything. The people are nice and they take cash or card."}
{"text":"After trying my first Sonoran hot dog in Tucson and subsequently falling in love with a food item, I decided I really needed to check out this little hot dog stand.   Now, I don't know if it's just because nothing compares to your first, but I would say this was not as good as El Guero Canelo. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty and I will be back ... but there is just something magical about El Guero Canelo's version. I would pay good money if someone could tell me where El Guero Canelo gets their buns. Those are the fluffiest, sweetest, most amazing buns I've ever had in my mouth.  Get your mind of of the gutter."}
{"text":"I have to give it up for this place, even though I let the lady know I did not want beans on my dog, it still rocked!! I have had better Sonoran Dogs in Tucson but these are still good, and the coke in the glass bottles just made it better."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in myself.  I have lived within a mile or so of Nogales Hot Dogs for going on 8 years. I have lived within a half mile for the last 7 months.  And it wasn't until recently I actually stopped and got a couple dogs. So many great Yelp reviews. So many great reviews from my friends. And for years, I have deprived myself of this little bit of mouth-magic!  The buns (like everyone else has mentioned) are amazing! Cloudlike, soft, but able to stand up to the dog and all the toppings. I loaded mine up with everything - and loved every last bite. Washed it down with a Mexican Coke (yay, real sugar!) and was a very very happy girl!  I put the second dog in the fridge and brought it to work for breakfast the next day. While the bread wasn't quite as perfect - I can vouch that as a fork and knife breakfast, even the day old Nogales Dog is still a winner!"}
{"text":"Literally the best hot dog I have ever had!!! I've been all over the country eating hot dogs as a late night after drinking snack and this is the best!!! Can't wait until I visit Phoenix again I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Soft and slightly sweet spongy bun, hot dog, bacon, beans, onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise, cheddar cheese, cotija cheese, salsa verde, mushrooms, guac, jalape√±o, various hot sauces.... and if that's not enough there's also mustard and ketchup for the traditionalists.  Add great customer service and service from a van, and you have the Nogales Sonoran dog for a mere $3.00!   That's a lot of toppings!   Good eat, but my only complaint is that the hot dog is not freshly grilled like the vendors on the streets of LA and the bun can get soggy quickly with the topping overload.   Very close to the airport and open late, so great for late night travelers like me!   The area looks a little scary but these guys get a constant stream of customers so that reduces the scary factor a bit.  Accepts credit card."}
{"text":"I've been past this place many nights on my trip between central phoenix and downtown scottsdale, I've heard of the delights to be had, I've desired the bacon wrapping, but I've never actually stopped. That is until now.   All the stars aligned this night. I had a hankering for something tasty, I was driving past, it was after everything else closed already - well except for taco bell, but who reall WANTS to eat at taco bell? We ordered up two dogs with all the toppings - well, everything but onions and tomato for me. As exciting as this moment was for me, I couldn't help but compare them to my favorite dog - (ShortLeash). I really think it's unfair to compare everyone to them, but you just can't help it. Pre-short leash this spot may have had high ratings in my book, but I left still hungry after an a-ok dog thinking that next time, I'll just stop at taco bell :-/  All in all - not a terrible hot dog, but nothing about it made me want to \"write home about it\" with exception of their late night hours.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"although I don't want to admit I eat a lot of hotdogs... if your craving some junk food or your hung over this is the perfect place to go. Its a different style hotdog, its not like Chicago style with kraut or anything its Mexican with mayo and hot sauce and beans and bacon.. lol... all the sins you should probably not congest yourself with, nevertheless-- an awesome hotdog stand and really nice people."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Best Sonoran Dogs around by far."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Everyone in my party ate at least two hotdogs my cousin ate three. I had mine wrapped in bacon with grilled onions, mayo, green salsa and yellow cheese it was so good! Everyone else in my party had it with everything ( bacon wrapped, onions, tomatoes, beans & mayo) we all agree that the bread is something special. I can't wait to come back to this Phoenix gem"}
{"text":"These hot dogs are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. Need I say more?  My friend introduced me to this place the other night after our time at the Yard. Now I'm sold. Apart from an authentic Chicago dog I grew up on, these are the top dog. Yes, I rate hot dogs. That's normal right?  You must stop!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Coming from out of town, the place was initially hard to find, but the place is located in a tent on the side of a parking lot. They have a decent set up that even includes a TV you can watch. I had never had a Sonoran-style hot dog before so I have no baseline to compare, but I thought the food here was delicious and very affordable. There were plenty of add-ons available in addition to what was already on the hot dog. You can tell that the owners definitely know what they are doing. I will definitely come back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"A fully loaded dog here is great and full of flavor . The wait just depends on how packed the tent is , sometimes the parking lot will be full to the brim but they clear it out quick ! Sometimes you might catch them at a slower time but always great friendly fast service !"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious hot dogs coming out of this place!  How can you go wrong with bacon wrapped hot dogs???  Super friendly staff, reasonably priced and quick place to get some late night eats in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love these hot dogs and I don't like hot dogs!  It's on the corner of a busy street yes but it is well worth it..."}
{"text":"These hot dogs are pretty yummy. I came here after a late night get together looking for something to eat. The hot dogs seem to be made to order and they package up all the toppings separately when you order to-go. The bun was a little soggy by the time I ate it but other than that it was good for 3 bucks a piece. Great and pleasant service despite the fact that the ladies were working in the chilly Arizona \"winter\" evening weather."}
{"text":"So I went there thinking they were going to be really good Sonoran  style hot dogs  and I was completely wrong because they were the most plain and horrible Sonoran hot dog I ever had! The bread was gross that I could of made a better simpler so ran hot dog so I will never go again and don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"IT IS A FOOD TRUCK. I wish that was stated somewhere on the page. I drove miles and miles today to find out it was not there. I had to do a web search, and that is where I found out. . I think that the word food truck should be put next to, or below the name. The stablishment at least should keep cust up to days of the whereabouts. Big bummer."}
{"text":"After reading an article in Edible Phoenix Magazine Summer '08 a few weeks ago, I was convinced that the next time I drive past wondering what is going on that street corner, that I will stop now.  These hidden bacon wrapped jems come with mayo, tomatoes, beans, and onions for $2.75 on a fluffy homestyle bun.  The side condiments include chedder, parmesean, guacamole, green sauce, canned mushrooms, and whole pickled jalepenos.  Bagged chips, soda, and bottled water are also for sale and you can sit and eat at a picnic style setting in a parking lot while watching soap operas on a small television setting atop a trailer.  The tables are set with red sauce, 'atomic' green sauce, mustard, Tapito, and salt.  Be sure and get two of them and you'll be pleastly full all evening.  Please don't drive past here wondering any longer because you don't know what you're missing...bacon wrapped hot dogs, mmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"I am so pleased I found this place! After living in Tucson for several years I was really missing easy access to Sonoran Hotdogs. After trying several places in the Phoenix area, I must say this place is my absolute favorite! I live in the North West Valley but it is well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Just like my home Hot Dogs in Hermosillo by the University. They are rich and gigantic, so show up hungry!"}
{"text":"First stop right after our flight landed. This place was delicious ! Hot dogs on point"}
{"text":"Amazing if you're looking for a quick snack. The hot dogs are made fresh and the employees are really polite. I would recommend getting the works hot dog with the green sauce and for 3 dollars each dog? Delicious. The only down side is the location which is on the side of the road and you're outside with foldable chairs and tables. Other than that I have no complaints. I am for sure a returning customer :)"}
{"text":"Remember when Hot Dogs were boring and had just mayo, ketchup and/or mustard? Well I don't because I come here all the time. This food stop has one of the best Sonoran Style Hot Dogs in the Valley, nothing beats this place. Go now order everything on it and by the way they ACCEPT CC's now so A++!!!"}
{"text":"The hotdogs were ok but were too over priced for the quality. Alley was disappointed but both she and the girl who holds here leash went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as much as some of the other Yelpers, I really really did. But I just don't get what's so great about this place.   I was visiting my mom who is recovering from open heart surgery at the heart hospital and i was hungry. Its Sunday night so options aren't a lot. I came across Nogales Hot Dogs on Yelp and it was right down the road.   The pictures of the hot dogs looked outstanding and made my mouth water. They looked even better in person. So when I bit into them what was my reaction? \"That's it!\" I will say that the bread they come on is really good. I don't know if they make their own bread but it was different from majority of hot dog buns. But the hot dog wasn't that special. I had 3 of them each with different toppings on them cause I was starving and each one was more lackluster than the other. I will cut them some slack cause they said they were out of bacon wrapped dogs. And we all know bacon is the meaning of life so that might've made a huge difference. They also shouldn't charge bacon wrap dogs prices for a regular dog if they're out of bacon wrap ones.   I will try them again cause I normally like to give a place a couple tries before I review them. But If you never been here before, I wouldn't get my hopes up its going to blow you away like the other reviews say. I haven't been this disappointed since I found out Santa Claus wasn't real. And I only found that out last year when I caught him next to his Chevy truck taking a smoke break."}
{"text":"Perhaps all of the great reviews set me up for disappointment, but I don't understand all of the buzz. An Armour hotdog, half a strip of bacon, a Wonder bread bun, and, admittedly, lots of toppings for $2.75. Of course, if you're in the mood and you're passing by, I guess it's convenient."}
{"text":"Camelback rd. has established itself as the avenue for gourmet burgers.  Indian School is laying claim to the hot dog.  Between Nogales, Maui Dogs, the regular visits from Short Leash and now Joeys of Chicago, Indian School is fast becoming the defacto hot dog mecca for locals.  While not quite as good as the Sonoran dogs in Tucson or even Mexico, this place more than sufficiently satisfies your cravings.  And the fact that it is cash only and in a shady parking lot only heightens the 'South of the Border' like adventure."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped hotdog in the softest, melt in your mouth bun.  Pull a U-turn and do NOT pass this place by!   My bro-in-law whipped the fastest u-turn in a mini-van as we drove by and I was describing a Sonoran hot dog to him.   Not even kidding.   Bring cash.  Order two. Get it with everything (unless you hate onions like me, then just go right ahead and leave those off).  Don't forget to add avocado sauce.     Take 'em to go or enjoy them on the tables and chairs in the parking lot.   I have taken out of town visitors, family and gone on date nights here.  You can't say it's not an authentic and memorable experience, that's for sure.    So glad Nogales Hot Dogs is just down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for Sonoran Dogs (2 con todo). I liked that it came with extra toppings on the side and that they had ice cold Coke in bottles too.   The hot dogs were damn tasty. Although I wanted a bit more kick. Micky's Dogs are spicier and the bun is more substantial. Although, I live in the West Valley so Micky's is way too far to drive. The bacon is nice and crispy and the crema is perfect.  Price is just so reasonable too. I've encountered food trucks that charge gourmet prices. Nogales is a great staple for me and just the right price.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The bun was super soft, the topping seemed fresh. The order came out fast and the ladies are always cleaning. It was the best Sonoran dog I've ever had. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Provender: hot dogs, they got it 'em. This is a hot dog stand and not a physical location with about four to five tables that seat four people per table.  Prices: very reasonable. They also have the glass bottle real sugar cokes.  Parking: decent since they set up their stand in a small strip plaza.  People: fun for all ages but at night the crew tends to be more adults.  Perks: They also have a complimentary condiments to pile on the fixings. Great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"When you take a humble hot dog, snuggle it up with a chile pepper, wrap it in bacon and top it with multiple condiments you can only end up with one thing...The \"Sonoran Dog!\"  A street food staple in Sonora, Mexico and a highly sought after late night nosh in the greater Phoenix area, the Sonoran dog is a culinary marvel.  On the corner of Indian School road and 20th Street in Phoenix, in a parking lot of all places, you will find a cart bearing the name \"Nogales Hot Dogs,\"serving none other than Sonoran hot dogs.  A few picnic tables and a pop-up tent are all that separates this street food vendor from others. I sidled up to the cart and place my order (since this was my first visit, I asked to have my pair of dogs the way the vendor liked his). For the paltry sum of $7, I got two dogs topped with tomato, bacon, mayonnaise, cotija cheese and pinto beans along with a 16 ounce \"Mexican\" Coke (old school glass bottle, pure cane sugar, frosty and absolutely refreshing!)  From the first bite to the last, I enjoyed my Sonoran Dog experience. Although I would have liked a bit more depth of flavor, maybe more zest, I would drop in on the Nogales Dogs crew for a snack anytime. If you're in the area and feel a rumbling in your gut, drop on in an have a couple dogs, I did!"}
{"text":"Lauren R. did a great job explaining how these bad boys are served! She's right on the money and so are these! Seriously, some of the best hot dogs in town are here.. not topped with bacon but wrapped in bacon.. the hot dogs are not cooked on site but at a local commissary where they can legally cook bacon wrapped hot dogs. It is very much illegal not only in Arizona but in California to cook hot dogs on the street in this manor. In fact there was a lady in LA who was actually arrested for cooking and serving them this way.   Anyway, enough with the education.. stop by and eat one, keep this cart going, amazing hot dogs and friendly people running this one!! Oh and they have real Mexican coke, with sugar, no HFCS!"}
{"text":"They never disappoint!! The beautiful bacon wrapped hot dog with beans, mayo, onions, and tomatoes is cradled between this bread that could be classified as cloud bread is so satisfying. Me and my girls once traveled the roads in the pouring rain to nourish our Sonoran dog craving, they're that delicious."}
{"text":"It's a bacon wrapped hotdog with many topping choices, fun and tasty street food. It can save your life after a long night on the town. Tasty even when sober.  Scratched my hot dog itch for sure! Getting it to go works too! Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I've been searching for Sonoran dogs for years. They are everywhere in Tucson but I found my go to truck a couple of weeks ago. Love the hot dogs but they have authentic tacos and nachos too"}
{"text":"These are the best hot dogs I have had in a while! The bacon wrapped makes them super delicious, and they come with tomatoes mayo beans and other stuff you can add on. And it's a good affordable price, I would recommend for a late night snack"}
{"text":"If I'm out late and on this side of town....this place is great to satisfy the nibbles! Prices are decent, the dogs are tasty, and the owners are extremely friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Good hotdogs but still missing several of the staple toppings to be considered authentic sonoran dogs."}
{"text":"Nogales De Oeste?   Located just west of the Dairy Queen on Camelback is a new Nogales Hot Dog stand (or so their van logo would leave one to believe). Same yellow and red tent, same great service. However, these come with cheese (like, nacho cheese style sauce) on the everything dog. A new experience for me bug also a hit! And in the food desert that is 1:30am just-west-of-the-I-17, these dogs are a hit!  I spoke to the girl working (well, her daughter who could speak to me in english -- I'm so gringo) and asked if they were the same as their Indian School counterpart. She explained that there are a couple brothers who own a host of these sonoran dog stands around the valley so, while they are technically affiliated, they operate quite independently."}
{"text":"Its a solid five stars. Pull in, grab a night Sonoran Dog, some salsa and guac, and get out. Service is good, food is very decent (not the best Sonoran Dog I've ever had but still very good), and price is right.  When you get a late night hankerin', get on down and get yourself a dog."}
{"text":"Great late night hours. Anything late night makes me a fan. Pretty cheap hotdogs as well and the staff is super friendly. I thought this was a restaurant but just turns out to be a grill, cooler and some tables under a tent in a parking lot of a comic book store lol.   Although I'm a fan, I thought their hotdogs were ok. I definitely had better. The buns were big and the hotdog itself was small. Plus I couldn't taste the distinct flavors that I would with other hotdog stands around other parts of the country.   Portillos, Japan Dogs and other generic bacon wrapped hotdogs kinda tastes better. But hey, they are not open that late or don't exist in the Phoenix area. So this is pretty awesome for existing. Especially when the central Phoenix/Biltmore area is dead around 10pm!"}
{"text":"A great, convenient little food truck just around the block from my apartment.  OK...so the hot dogs aren't anything special, but they're good and its worth a stop now and then.  The little street tacos make a great late night snack.  And you can't go wrong with the Mexican sodas.  Mandarin is my fav."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting dogs here. I believe the secret to their dog is in the bun. It has that traditional sweet Mexican taste, possibly handmade or brought from south the border. You can't have just one!  Seats are limited, but they do accept major credit cards."}
{"text":"The short: Recommended for the tried-and-true hot dog fan looking for new hot dog experiences--bacon-wrapped dogs cooked on a flat top, dressed with some peculiar condiments such as mayonnaise, beans, onions, and chopped tomatoes. This isn't for the weak of heart, but it is for the daring dog lovers who understand this dog's attempt at being the \"perfect bite.\"   The long: I read a well-known blogazine's article about the country's best hot dogs, and Sonoran hot dogs had a solid standing on the list. They seem to be easy finds around Tucson, but not here in Phoenix. I've heard of a lot of talk about where to find these throughout the Valley--usually nomadic carts that rove around Indian School out west (in the avenues), but this truck has a \"reserved spot\" so to speak in the parking lot of Guitar and Keyboard City on the southwest corner of Indian School and 20th St. Stragenly, I've only ever seen it there after the sun goes down, and I've gotten dogs there as late as 11 p.m.  When you drive up, all you see are a white van, hood up so its battery can power the impromptu eatery--an electric lantern forming a tight space containing a flat top (griddle), a table holding various condiments on ice (cotija cheese, smooth guacamole), and some little to-go containers to fill and take away, a five little plastic folding tables and chairs so you can sit and eat, communal style, and a little TV for ambiance. A woman's cooking up the dogs and sliding them into their wonderfully soft, pillowy bolillo buns, and a man dresses them and wraps them up in foil for you. The man will greet you with a nod or hello, then ask you how many dogs you'd like. He'll whisper it to the woman grilling the dogs, and within moments, you're ready to go. The little tables are fine, especially with Phoenix's typical great night-time weather, but I prefer the dashboard picnic. Just be careful about keeping your toppings in your bun--nothing like a wayward bean bouncing off into the dark crevices of your car.)  If you stack on extra condiments, put the \"lightweight\" stuff down first, or you'll risk having it all tumble off with your first big-mouthed bite. This is definitely the kind of food you should lean forward to eat. The place also sells a selection of potato chips, water, and soda. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"Sonaran hot dog $4.50 with Coca Cola bottle. Waited 10 min for them to fix their machine. Hot dog was ok just overrated. The hot dog came wrapped in bacon. Sauces galore."}
{"text":"I loved the casual atmosphere at Nogales Hot Dogs. Sure, it's just a cart in the middle of nowhere, but it certainly has its charm. The two women who tend the cart made me feel at home with their quiet hospitality.  I ordered two hot dogs and a classic bottle of Coke. I dressed the first hot dog with simple condiments and the other with the guacamole sauce and mushrooms. It was the first time eating hot dogs with beans without the chili. It was a little odd, but I enjoyed the local twist. As for the mushrooms, I wasn't too fond of them. They lacked flavor, but it's nothing a large jalape√±o can't fix.  It was a little early to see the mob of hungry drunks, but one of the ladies comforted her coworker telling her that around 11 p.m. is when the fun starts. I solemnly ate my hot dogs as I listened to them talk about Latin Actor William Levy. At the same time, a random car drove by and someone yelled out, \"Give me one!\" Seems like a legit place for a hot dog."}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"Bizarre Foods\" when the host was in Arizona. The host gave a great review and Yelpers seemed to love the Sonoran hot dogs they serve so we decided to give it a try. We were staying at a hotel nearby and it was 112 degrees outside so we decided to get it to-go.  We put everything on the hot dogs, and boy, it was great.   There a lots of Sonoran hot dog places in Arizona and I have been to couple of others before, but I have to say Nogales Hot Dogs was the best I've had.  If you are visiting Phoenix area, definitely a place to stop by. And if you do visit, do yourself a favor and grab 2. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Eeeeequela! These dogs are life!!! Anytime we're needing something to soak up the alcohol; or if we're being fat, we like to hit this stand up. They have covered seating, television, drinks, etc. And price is always a cheap eat!"}
{"text":"I noticed the ratings for this place and thought I'd give it a try. Me and my cousin drove there and it was about 20 minutes away. I didn't realize that it was a food truck until I looked up the reviews on yelp. On top of that they didn't show up until 8pm, but it said they open at 7pm. Staff was nice though and I liked their set up.   We ordered about 6 sonoran dogs and had it to go. Everything was packaged nicely. I thought the dogs were ok and good, but not great. The ingredients were good except for the beans, seemed a bit over dry to me. Probably the best thing was that salsa. It had a very nice heat to it and made the dog really stand out and taste better. All in all, I most likely wouldn't drive out there again just because I know I can get almost the same exact sonoran dog near me."}
{"text":"Just try it! Best hot dogs ever! And if you don't like hot dogs, you will after trying their bacon wrapped hot dogs! Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've been here but, every time was as good as the last. I order mine without beans, with grilled onions and + all the extra toppings. The bun is so soft it feels like you're bitting into cotton candy. A+ ratting. Best sonora dog I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"The best! I wish I would have posted a picture of the warm, spicy, fluffy goodness but I just picked it up and devoured it! Been going here for years but I had not been here in a while and I'm happy to report that the quality of the Sonoran style dogs is still there!"}
{"text":"Open late to eat great! Some of the best hot dogs in Phoenix, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late night bite after a movie. Very friendly owners, they explained what was on their hot dogs, asked how many I wanted and was it for here or to go. I decided to stay and eat as they had several seats open.   They have four or five tables under a tent, but seats fill up fast. I couldn't believe how many people started to drive in for a hot dog.   The owner brought over my two hot dogs, (bacon wrapped, mayo, onion and tomato) served on a Mexican bun. I elected not to have beans which comes standard.   There is a self serve cooler with sauces, jalape√±os and two choices of cheese. I added cheddar cheese to both of my hot dogs.   They were very good! I had never had mayo on a hot dog before, delicious!  I enjoyed every bite of both of my hot dogs and washed them down with an ice cold Mexican Coke.   When I was finished, the owner came over and told me what I owed. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to pre-pay. Nice touch. Prices are great too!  If you are in the area and want a late bite, stop by Nogales Hot Dog!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Sonoran dogs ever.   The ladies are very very friendly and I love that they have square to take cards!   Love all the extra toppings on the side!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Nogales Hotdogs: A Hot Dog Attraction   I ordered two with everything on them and a refreshing coke in a glass bottle. The hot dog is wrapped in bacon crammed with beans tomatoes and more especially that you could add more toppings. Of course you may ask, how can a hot dog bread hold so much food without falling apart and that is because it does not use a hot dog bun it uses another type of bread. I think it might have been a \"bolillo\" type bread.   \"Whoa whoa!!!\" some might say \"a hot dog without the classic type hot dog bread?\" has the whole world gone crazy!!! Well believe this a Sonoran Dog doesn't fit in a classic hot dog bun because it doesn't belong in a classic hot dog bun.   There is no secrete formula to these animals, in all possibility some might say there is nothing special about these, \"I can make that from home.\" type thought from those fancy critics. One thing is for sure you can not make the atmosphere like this from home, sitting on a street corner at night is not a common thing in fact kinda adds a risky edge. Saw a few kind of gypsy looking people walk by and immediately I imagined my self eating a hot dog in one of those dangerous cities from Mexico you hear about. such as hint hint Nogales. Hence the attraction aspect to it.  So after I was done eating I paid my tab, gladly paid, we need more friendly people like this running businesses. After that we dove for our vehicles and bailed before the Mexican Drug Cartels could show up."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ladies who run the stop are so sweet and friendly. The hotdogs are delish! Oh and the wild kitty provided great entertainment."}
{"text":"They're super nice, they're open late, it's cheap. It's a cart in a parking lot with a TV hooked up, kind of a memorable experience.   But it isn't some sort of magical experience. It's a hot dog, it's fine. Don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Before my second trip out to Phoenix I did a search for the best foods from the area. Nogales was something that popped up right away! I was slightly intimidated by the location but that's only because I was new to the area. Definitely nothing to be afraid of. Stop your car now, if you're contemplating pulling into the lot! If you are, you should be! The buns are what everyone says...soft, cloud like deliciousness. The hotdog was a bit over cooked but all the toppings made up for it! I'll be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"For $3, you get a bacon-wrapped hot dog in a delicious bun (all the \"cloud\"-referencing reviews aren't inaccurate) topped with beans, mayo, and tomatoes. They also throw in sides of a watery guacamole sauce (it's not bad, just watery so you can pour it over your dog easier), two different kinds of cheese, and salsa. Delicious and a good price.  It was a little hard to find in the dark because I was expecting an actual shop, not a food truck, but they're always in the same place (their shirts and truck even have Indian School & 40th St. written on it)."}
{"text":"This is a great street vendor experience: The food isn't bad, the place is open until shady hours of the night, and the location elevates the experience of eating a hotdog from boring to feeling a tad dangerous and cool.   Nogales Hot Dogs makes eating hot dogs feel dangerous and cool. That's reason enough for you to go."}
{"text":"Another location is in North PHX on the north side of Bell Road just east of Cave Creek Road.  The most delicious Sonoran dogs in Phoenix! I love how they load 'em up--bacon, beans, mayonesa, onions, cotija cheese, yellow cheese, guac, salsa, (canned) mushrooms, jalape√±os--all on a soft, buttery bun. The service is ALWAYS super friendly and their tables are clean. You really can't beat the price... 2 dogs and 2 Mexican Cokes for under $10?! YES PLEASE."}
{"text":"Been going here for years -- back when it was just a hot dog stand. Now it's a food truck with an extensive menu. I recommended the hot dogs, vampiros and street tacos. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the location, nor by the name, you will be missing out if you don't give them a shot.  The first time that I saw the van on the side of the road several years ago, I ignorantly chuckled and never thought that I would see myself trying their product.  Well, three years later, here we are and I must say that my ignorant chuckle was exactly that, Ignorant!  If you are curious about trying a Sonoran Hotdog, or if you have no idea what a Sonoran Style Hotdog is, then trust me when I say that this is a definite must in the hotdog world.  The traditional American styles don't stand a chance to the Sonoran Style, not even a Chicago Style dog can touch these guys.  First off, the dog is wrapped in a nice strip of swine, a.ka. (bacon), you then add toppings, such as chopped tomato, peppers, different types of salsa's, finely grated artisan cheese, similar to Parmesan. There are so many different combinations, that you can't eat just one or two. The flavor of the peppers in the Salsa's goes along with the flavor of the dog and the bacon like a bullet in a gun, you can't do any damage unless you have both of them together. :)  The family at this location is as friendly as can be, so don't be scared if you're an uncultured white person, you're not going to get robbed or shot if you're respectful and cool...lol It's good to get out of your stupid comfort zone and be a real human once in a while.   You will have a memorable experience and be glad that you experienced something new, and your tongue will be thanking you and asking you to go back for more instead of driving by and contemplating on making a stop in the future.  The cool thing is that you can sit at the table under a nice awning, drink a Mexican Coke, and pay your entire tab with cash at the end of your experience. If for some reason you have a problem, give me a shout..I'm right up the street. ;)  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Tucson & I would head down to Nogales Mexico from time to time... one thing one must do in Nogales is get a Hot Dog from a street vendor. The hot dogs are sooo good. Anyways when I heard about this shop I just had to eat a dog & true to it's name, yes they are quite good as the shops in Nogales. The staff is friendly & the service is prompt. I can't say more of this place, but that I'm The Duke of this spot! I doubt that anyone will ever take my Dukieness, but Amber is welcome to try. First dog is on me Baby."}
{"text":"It was not bad not the best I had.  Well I had ate similar Mexican style hotdog  2 times in Los Angeles.      I think the buns were your park picnic white buns. How to improve ? Maybe grill it    Cool outdoor location.  Friendly owner.  The condiments section was nice but the mushrooms should be hot. Maybe I should had ask for it to be cooked.       Good price"}
{"text":"So I was on my way to in & out , it's pass midnight,  I'm hungry and choices are limited . But on my way up 20th st , I spot a food truck. Now I'm all about food trucks so I dinch my protein style in & out desire and take a chance.  My o my right decision.  Tasty hot dogs , that's right hot dogs stacked with everything on it . I order 2 , 1 could of hit the spot but I'm greedy.  If you have the chance,  give it try cost me 7 bucks for 2 fully load dogs , not a bad price you might pay 5.99 for one dog this stacked at five guys. Great ladies working there and sitting space.  I recommend giving them a try for sure."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to find out they have a yelp. I have been going there for years and am planning to go tonight which is why I looked it up. The hot dogs are amazing and made to order. The bread is so fresh and definitely makes the meal 100 times better"}
{"text":"You know a place has made it when it's a little business on a corner and they have amazing reviews! I was skeptical at first but it ended up being great! The ladies who made the hot dogs were kind and sure knew how to make great hot dogs! I wasn't disappointed and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yummmmo! My fav spot for an impromptu bite to eat. Usually no drink for me, just eat more hot dogs! You'll need at least 2!"}
{"text":"Not the best sonoran dog I've had and my dreams are still dominated by the famous ones in tucson but I thought it was pretty tasty overall and only cost $3 for a pretty overstuffed pooch.  I like their whole set up though. It feels way less sketchy than buying hot dogs out the side of a van. Which is sort of what you're doing."}
{"text":"This is such a fun, little place. Its technically a hot dog stand with tables and chairs but something about this place made me feel like such a local Phoenician! lol.   They serve Sonoran dogs that are wrapped in bacon with all the fixin's! So delicious. The bread and cheese they use are just fantastic. The owner was such a sweet lady and they were also quick.   I will definitely be back to this place sometime soon. 2 hotdogs and 2 sodas for $9.00? SCORE!"}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty amazing, Sonora dogs were a little weird with beans inside...I've never had one that way but it was still good. It was an overall good experience. They have all the condiments you could ever want in a cooler ready for the picking. I just wish they were out there before 7pm."}
{"text":"For a late night bite this is the first place that comes to mind. Never have I had such a good hot dog with so many toppings to choose from. Plus you can't beat the price. In a way it gets me my Mexican food craving and my hot dog craving all in one. If there was one negative it's that I wish they were open earlier hours as well so when I crave one for lunch I could get one."}
{"text":"Many may think eating at a restaurant that sets up in a parking lot after the car shop closes might be dicey as far as the health code goes but as we all know, the city health inspectors are crooks and hired usually through nepotism and political graft (how else would Denny's remain open?), so I say forge ahead and experience Nogales Hot Dogs!  My friend, Mike, had spoken often about me trying a heavenly wiener, and as he's heterosexual, I assumed it was a food product. To my delight and relief, it was.  Mike and I arrived just as they set up and with a little bit of everything on the bacon-wrapped dogs and glass bottles of Coca-Cola, I was scarfing down the delicious mystery meat and considering having another, even though it would be too much to digest and I'd be throwing up from the acid reflux.  I can't recommend this place highly enough. Get there early because it fills up fast. As for the next morning, depending on how much hot stuff you put on your dog, you might not want to make any early appointments."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran Hot Dogs in the area. I can always count on them for the late night munchies!"}
{"text":"This was my first real Sonoran hotdog, and it was great! Not too much else to say, other than definitely go check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST! Cheap, tasty mexican food served out of a roach coach! Yes those dogs are awesome but what this one has that the carts don't are the vampiros. So bomb! Eat those grilled sonoran peppers and some habanero hot sauce and your doin it right! The owner is at this location a lot. He's a nice guy. Owns all the carts around the valley. Either you have to know where they are or ask him he'll tell you. Too bad they don't stay open after the bars it is perfect drunk food!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews were so high. Was handed what appeared to be a pre-wrapped sonoran dog in tinfoil with a bunch of condiments on the side. Tasted okay, nothing spectacular. Definitely prefer the Sonoran dog at Water & Ice at 40th & Thomas."}
{"text":"Awesome hot dog  On 20th street and Indian school i think they only open at night."}
{"text":"The best late nite spot to get food. The Sonoran dogs are cheap and amazing. Best weiner I've ever put in my mouth."}
{"text":"Best mexican style hot dogs in the valley in my opinion and that's coming from a mexican. They are also very kind and attentive because customer service matters. They are bacon wrapped served on a warm soft bun with beans and you add all the extra yummy stuff like cheese salsa guacamole. Area a little scary but that's cool because I usually get to go anyway! Well that's my review now go buy a hot dog and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I've been driving by this parking lot every day on my way home from work since we moved into our house in the fall, and I always think to myself, I've got to stop there and get a hot dog. If it comes from a cart powered by a van with the street address painted on the side, it's GOT to be good, right?  Well it is good, and my wait is finally over. I got a hot dog to go tonight, with the works: pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, mayo, parmesan cheese, jalapeno salsa, cheddar cheese...my only complaint is that my mouth is not big enough to fit every tasty morsel in at once. But I guess that's my problem, not theirs.  My hot dog was not wrapped in bacon...I wonder if they've succumbed to the pressures of healthy eating? Hmm."}
{"text":"Yet another to cross off my list of items to try as a new transplant to Arizona. From the bombardment of grilled dogs wafting through the air driving home late at night, Travel Channel airings of the best of Arizona and Instagram drunchie pics- why the hell not?  Made it out to Nogales with Kay T. after a Yelp event in the Central Phoenix/Biltmore area and was looking for something substantial to curb our hunger at a late time. Had Nogales on my bookmarks for quite some time and decided to head here.  I ordered the Sonoran hotdog that you get here and went topping crazy, when in Rome? Exactly. The hotdog is topped with beans, quac, tomatoes, onion, mayo and I went ahead and topped it with shredded cheese, mushrooms, queso cotija and gave myself a side of pickled jalapeno. Also they had Cerritos, so you know a girl had to grab one ... ended up with the Mandarin one.  The bun was so soft and fluffy, wish it was kind of bigger to hold all the toppings and the hot dog. The hot dog was typical- I didn't get a bacon wrapped one, but it was the toppings that took it to the next level. It's pretty much a hot dog with a regional flair! Did I love it? Not as much as I would have thought I would, I guess it left a lot more to be desired. However, that's another thing I got to cross off my list of things to try!  They accept cash and card at the cart."}
{"text":"Everyone loves a good hot dog! Now, imagine that good hot dog wrapped in bacon, on Mexican style buns, oh my lord.. I'm getting excited.  First of all, the Nogales Hot Dog cart is located on 20th st and Indian School in a random parking lot- don't let it deter you. Its nice and dark out there, so I enjoy going often in my pajamas.  The standard hot dog is wrapped in bacon and served wit mayonnaise, tomatoes and pinto beans. On top, I generally add cojita cheese, a spicy green chile and mushrooms! YES! Mushrooms! They also have a guacamole type sauce, hot peppers and Mexican soda! They have everything!  I would just like to say that I think that the service is outstanding. The men and women that run the cart are always so friendly and very helpful. They even gave my boyfriend a t-shirt once!   You HAVE to try these hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend live across the street from their set up and man oh man wish I didn't, it's so yummy and reasonably priced I mean 2 Sonoran dogs two chips and two drinks for 11 bucks and all the toppings you can get! The great part about their stand is it's open super late which is awesome because me and my boyfriend work long hours and hardly any thing is open by the time we are ready to eat! The folks working the stand are kind and the food is down right good!"}
{"text":"Look, I'm just a Philly guy from out of town that was in town for business for a few days, and happened to have a friend in Phoenix who wanted to show me the best of Phoenix street food.  I'm not one to say no to that proposition.    And I don't know if these Mexican style hot dogs are better than the ones you get in LA or anything like that.  I'm not that savvy when it comes to this style.    But what I will say is this... after trying one of these with guacamole, cheese, and salsa, I wanted to immediately eat two more.    You know what really sold it to me?  The roll.  I've never had such a soft hot dog roll in my life.  And even though it was so soft, it held together like a champ with all of those ingredients on it.  The ladies told me that they get them from a local bakery.  Kudos to that bakery, whomever that is.    I was considering naming this the best hot dog I've ever had after eating it.  Today, I'm not going to be that extreme.  But it's right up there with my favorite places, and it will be a repeat destination for me if I'm ever back in town."}
{"text":"Ohhh myyyy goodness... These dogs are fabulous! We went here for an early Mother's Day dinner as my mom has been dying to try these after reading about them in the paper.  PROS: What sticks in my mind is the most amazingling soft cloud-like buns. Also, I was surprised at how much I loved the beans they put on top! Yum! Also, the owners were SO incredibly nice. They made eating on the side of Indian School Rd. in a furniture store parking lot surprisingly cozy. It is clearly family run and it shows in the best of ways. CONS: I wish the bacon would have been a little crisper or showcased more, rather than being buried under the toppings. Oh well can't have it all. I will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so last night I had the munchies and decided to finally try this place... and I'm glad I did.  I really didn't know what to expect.  Mexican hotdogs really doesn't happen in my family.    I asked what the hotdog comes with and they said bacon, beans, cheese, onions, mayo and tomatoes.  So, I ordered everything but the mayo (mayo on a dog?).  The hotdogs comes in this amazing bread (it's not a hotdog bun).  The flavors were great together but it seemed like it was missing something... next time I'm getting the mayo.  Plus, they have these other types of salsas you can add and I should have added that.   I'll be back soon but next time I'm gonna mix it up."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Hot dogs are the best and the tacos are great too.  They are even open for lunch on the weekends.  My daughter loves the tacos de caveza.  I find it hard to pick because I know it is all great and I can't eat it all."}
{"text":"went back for the little guy's birthday after his first game of miniature golf the dinner request 'hot dogs!'...still delicious, still super friendly, still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Tasty Sonoran-style hot dogs which is a smoke bacon wrap hot dog topped with beans, fresh tomatoes, grill onions, mayonnaise and cream sauce. Hit the toppings stations if you want to add additional toppings including shredded cheddar cheese, salsa and avocado sauce. They also have ice cold coke in 355 ml glass bottles."}
{"text":"The buns are good but the bacon tastes cheap and the actual hot dog tastes like its boiled in water. I would prefer a gas station hot dog over these. Wish there were more Sonoran hot dog options around."}
{"text":"My brother, boyfriend, and I visited Nogales Hot Dogs for the first time last night. It wasn't hard to find because I previously read Brittanie's review about it being a food truck and not an actual shop. For three Sonoran dogs and three sodas the total was $13.50. The man and woman who run the stand were both very friendly.   Everything on the dog: A bacon wrapped hot dog, mayo, tomatoes, onions, and beans, all on a soft bun. Guacamole, green salsa, mushrooms, and two types of cheeses were also given to us in Dixie cups. I also loved having a Coke from a glass bottle.   I wanted to order another Sonoran dog as soon as I was finished but I restrained myself. Overall experience? YUM, YUM, AND YUM! Five stars all the way. I will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"We finally made it to this place on December 04, 2010. We arrived at 6:00 PM and the hot dog stand was not there. We drove down Indian School Rd for a couple of miles, turned around and came back to 20th St and Indian School. The Hot Dog ladies were finally  there setting up the show. By 6:30 PM, they were ready to go.  My wife and I ordered one hot dog each. The hot dogs came with beans, mayo, tomatoes and of course the bacon wrapped hot dog in a warm, soft delicious bun. We topped them off with mushrooms, salsa verde, guacamole and shredded cheese. We also enjoyed a GLASS bottel of Coca-Cola. The Coke is the Mexican version made with real sugar and not corn syrup.  The hot dogs were so good, we each ordered another one. The bill for four loaded hot dogs and two bottles of Coke was $14.00. We gave the lady collecting the money and told her to keep the change. Both women were very grateful for the tip.  I have to say, this portable hot dog stand was immaculate. The ladies wore a new set of plastic gloves each time they did a food transaction. We sat at one of the many tables they had set up under a canopy. The chairs are not those flimsy plastic ones that a 150 pound person can break. They are sturdy metal types that a 300 pounder can't break (lol).  By the way, they have a Maricopa County Health permit affixed to the cart, so you don't have to worry about this business being legit.  I can not say one bad thing about our experience. All of the customers we saw (it got rather busy) were very friendly and patient. The ladies move things along rather quickly and efficiently.  10 Thumbs Up to this place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hit this place originally after reading Eliot Wexler's review in Edible Phoenix. If Eliot likes something, odds are that I'm going to follow right along. Was definitely the case.  Was driving by tonight at 1:00 am & just had to stop again. Quick hit for a hot dog with everything - bacon, mayo, beans, tomatoes and onions on a soft bun/roll.  Piled on my condiments of choice, canned mushrooms - lots of them (just got to love the canned mushrooms), guacamole, cheddar, cotija & salsa.   Powered down while there, including retopping the dog countless times with my falling condiments. So yummy.  Just a great end to a great night."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place on Yelp after a late night of dancing in downtown Phx.  There is no menu, just Mexican hot dogs, period, just like the name.  They have a few salsas and bottled drinks to choose from sitting in ice chests.  This place is completely outdoors with a few folding tables and chairs and a couple, nice Mexican woman that serve you quickly.  The buns were fresh and soft, the hot dogs could be a little bigger, it got lost in that awesome bun.  Otherwise, a great late night snack!"}
{"text":"Stealing a line from my escort we dined with great fanfare. Where? Venice. Right on the canals. A hotdog after some late night shenanigans hits the spot. These are wonderful hotdogs, perfectly cooked and served on a unique bun. (Uno momento to describe.)  I ate two of them. They are works of beauty when delivered to your table. Located outside under a tent in a parking lot a person might just drive by. Very casual. Slow down in your excitement. Your belly will be happy. This food truck offers table service. I found this incredibly charming. Take a seat and someone will be out to offer options.  I'm not quite sure which options I inhaled. Like i said, late night, and I hoovered two. Delicious. Bacon, mayo, jalape√±os, salsa, beans, maybe some pico? Then I squirted two different green spicy sauces on top. Oh! And sprinkled cheese. (Cheese makes everything better!)  The bun is not a potato bun. It was flaky, sweet and buttery. The bun could readily be eaten alone. Slightly warmed with a hint of butter and you'd be ready to go.  I'm told Nogales is looking to open a Sushi location *next* door in the near future. Very exciting news. The night we visited I had the good fortune to meet Juan, the owner. Nicest man ever!  Please note: Cash only."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are pretty much my favorite food, and Nogales Hot Dogs does not disappoint! There are definitely a few good hot dog places around Phoenix, and this one is up there with the good ones. I had the Sonoran style hot dog, which was absolutely mouth watering. They had a great selection of toppings as well, more than I was expecting. I thought the prices were vary reasonable, about $3-4. If you're looking for a new joint to try a fabulous hot dog, this is the place!"}
{"text":"So I found out I was going to be coming in to Scottsdale for a conference and my husband was anxious to find a place to try this sonoran hot dog we've heard so much about on food shows.   We followed directions on my phone's GPS in our rental car, driving up and down the street each time it would look like we passed our target. He finally calls them and they explain they are located in front of some building. We pull up and I'm incredulous- he brought me to a van, tent, folding table and chairs set up. I was starving but refused to eat at that point. There was no way I was eating on a plastic chair in a parking lot.   So he orders one with everything for himself and I watch him eat it. My mouth starts watering. He offeres me a bite. I try to refuse and then can't anymore. SO GOOD!!! A hot dog wrapped in bacon in a definitely different bun- slightly sweet and soft. Topped with beans, onions, tomatoes, salsa verde, mayo (which can be good on a hot dog), mexican cheese. It is so good we still crave it.   And much like the lesson we all learned as kids: Never judge a book by it's cover. Don't look at it like a tent in a parking lot. It's a hot dog oasis in a concrete jungle. :)"}
{"text":"I googled Best Hotdogs in Phoenix and found Nogales Hotdogs.  I got one with everything and added more.   We drove 6.8 miles out of our way and my husband was not happy until we got our food.  The buns are amazing and truly are cloud like.  I will be searching for a Mexican bakery which sells them.  If I find them I'll never have am American style hotdog bun again!  The hotdogs are bacon wrapped and grilled.  I ordered mine with everything.  Next time I will order more sauce - mayo or crema - not sure. I added several extra toppings and cannot say enough how great it was.  It's a really nice owner operated outdoor stand with outdoor tables under an awning just like in Mexico.  2 hotdogs and a bottled water were $7.  I love this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went here after a night of drinking. Their hotdogs are cheap and good for midnight munching. They accept cash and cards which is great since they're just a mini stand. Would love to try them again."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHOENIX!! enough said.   not a whole lot of choices, but the best hot dogs, the best lengua tacos and great service. authentic. we go here every single Saturday night for dinner."}
{"text":"Holly crap the best hot dogs ever... Ordered one with everything. It upsets me when I see people order it plain and ass ketchup. That is  not what it is indented for.. Nogales Hot Dogs!! Anywho the plane is outside and I prefer to take them to go. They have a salsa bar that makes to go perfect. Love them  !"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, although I think it's going to get popular real soon.  Note to all people trying to find this place, it's a permanent FOOD TRUCK where you sit under a tent.  Don't go looking for a brick and mortar restaurant because you'll never find it.    Delish:  Nogales Dog with everything, asada burrito, and nachos.    Order from the guy that's usually there, grab your drinks out of the ice chest, wander over to the white cooler filled with toppings then have a seat and wait for them to bring your food.  You pay after you are done.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"After having the bacon wrapped hot dogs in Tucson at El Guero Canelo and BK'S I was excited to try these and only have one thing to say \"Go to Tucson\"  The mexican hot dog buns are good and the bacon wrapped dog is lost in all the the condiments beans salsa.  The questionable thing was all the add on that you don't know how long they have been sitting out.  It is a food truck style so don't expect anything nice and don't expect to sit down.  I think once you have tried something better it is tough to live up to those expectations."}
{"text":"I can see how people would like this little food truck/hot dog stand. Lots of topping choices and Mexican cokes definitely add to the appeal. I just thought it was ok. The quality and taste of the hot dogs themselves was not good. I did appreciate the unique toppings but the hot dogs were gross. They should use Nathan's or Hebrew national!"}
