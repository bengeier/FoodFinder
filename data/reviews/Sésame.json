{"text":"If you want a Quebec version of Chinese food, this is the place to go.

 I ordered a Shrimp Chow Mein. For this dish: egg noodles and non Chinese vegetables (cucumber,...no Bok Choy) are used. It was tasty. More on the healthy style. Shrimps were well cooked, not too hard. 

Didn't taste like traditional, typical Chinese food.

Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came here for supper before heading to the Montreal en Lumiere festival which was right across the street from the restaurant. 

It was packed, but we still got seated right away, and the service was spectacular! We thought we were gonna be there for an hour, judging by how full the place was, but we were in and out within 30 minutes. 

I got the vege pad Thai, and it was delicious! Portions were huge! I couldn't even finish it. 

Prices are a little on the expensive side for Chinese food, but then again this wasn't in Chinatown. 

Really enjoyed my meal, and would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Superbe petit resto asiatique dans le cartier des spectacles.

Premièrement, sourtout pour les soirs de spectacle: réserver! Je l'es es vue toujours de bords énormement de gens sans réservation. 

En rentrant puisque nous allions à un spectacle et avions une contrainte de temps, nous l'avons mentionner a la serveuse qui semblais super a laise et relax avec sa. Les plats était super gouteux et bien présenter. Le goût typique qu'on attend de ces plats asiatique. Tout sur le menu avais l'air délicieux, il y avais même une table d'hote offerte pour le soir. Il y avais une belle carte des vins surprenament TRÈS abordable. Bref, super option pour un souper avant d'aller à la place des arts qui es juste à coter."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a few friends. None of them particularly enjoyed their meal. The atmosphere was nice and the waitress was exceptional, the only bad thing was the food. I had a salad but the lettuce wasn't particularly fresh. The fried spring roll that came with my salad was also not very good, and didn't really have anything inside the fried shell. My friends, who ordered pad Thai, had nothing good to say about it, with one of them saying he only ate it to be polite."}
{"text":"Food was flavourless. The beef was grey... the pad Thai  was suppose to have a variety of veggies and it was 97% celery. My friend was sick throughout the night."}
{"text":"While the decor is visually interesting, it doesn't make up for the food's quality/price ratio. It tasted decent, at best.

My wonton soup was a bit spicy and packed with vegetables, which I did enjoy. However, the lack of dumplings disappointed me. I mean, whoever heard of a wonton soup with only two dumplings in it?

I appreciated the fact that there were actual chunks of really crispy chicken in my General Tao, but it was completely bland and the sauce was tasteless. If a restaurant advertises a meal as 'spicy', the chef should ensure that it actually is. 

However, the blackberry tea was just magnificent. Too bad I didn't think of bringing some back home.

The space is small, but it isn't too difficult to find a table, despite the high number of reservations. Wait times were quick, and the waitress was polite and professional, refilled my glass of water without me having to ask her (I'm kind of picky about that), etc.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't return to eat there if only for the fact that I've had much better Szechuan elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good. Ate outside and was a bit poor atmosphere. But food and service were excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The black sesame ice cream is just pure bliss! Loved the vegetarian Tom Kha soup as well. The veggie dumplings that came with a spicy peanut sauce is also a must try for vegetarians. Great cocktails- The yuzu beer and feng shui were both amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boss, very nice food. Waitress asked too many times if we were ok to pay for cranberry and club soda as two drinks when combined (she asked 3 times) but that was the only annoying thing otherwise a very nice dinner"}
{"text":"The general Tao chicken is the real deal so is the location, located right by place des arts, it's that one stop during summer, service is good, wait time not really that long, and they have my beer Saporo so I am good !"}
{"text":"Horrible place to go. Staff was nice and friendly but the food was horrible. Rice was uncooked and hard. Worst food I ever ate. Very disappointment."}
{"text":"On aime bien le général tao, mais c'est cher, pas trop de stationnement. Belle petite terrasse pour ceux qui aiment ça. Service assez long quand même."}
{"text":"Très bon ! Nous avons pris ma mère et moi un repas à partager et c'était succulent ! Sauf peut être pour les crevettes mais seulement parce que je n'aime pas le curi. Nous y avons été un lundi soir tard et il n'y avait presque personne et la serveuse était très gentille! Thé vert excellant :) J'y retourne c'est sûre ! Petit conseil, le midi, c'est plein à craquer donc lundi - mardi soir  = parfait ! Ah aussi je n'ai pas pris de cocktail, je ne connais pas vraiment les ingrédients qu'il y avait et ils sont assez chers donc je n'ai pas pris de chance."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after the lumiere festival and loved it! The vibe is intimate yet lively and the service is exceptional. The cocktails are delicious-lychee is fresh and sweet, the red wine was also great!! I had the chicken pad Thai and it was probably the best I've had. If I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular. Great date night spot or even just a dinner with friends. I saw some lady's night specials on the menu as well ;)"}
{"text":"This is what \"Asian\" food tastes like in Purgatory. Nothing particularly good or bad about it. Its clean and the food is decent. It's a chain.

On a related note: Is it just me, or are all yelp ratings overinflated? I think it is because people don't want to think they've wasted their time or money, so end up elevating their rating to compensate. Time to reinstitute my ratings glossary.

1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"AWESOME asian fusion restaurant in Montreal. A friend and I went here on a Friday night during the Lumiere festival. We had a bit of a wait (maybe 15 to 20 minutes), but then we were seated in the upper level balcony area. This place has a super trendy, but also laid back, vibe.

They have a huge drink selection. For people who don't really like the classic hard liquor drinks like myself and have a taste for the sweeter mixed cocktails, it was perfect. Their cocktail menu isn't available online so I couldn't look up my drink, but it was very sweet and good. 

They had a huge selection of vegetarian options with a bunch of tofu entres. I got a wok dish and my friend went with the classic General Tsaos Chicken. Both were awesome. Our waitress was very nice and gave us the low down on all the cool bars to go to since we were aimless tourists. We went straight to her favorite bar after the meal and had a great night."}
{"text":"Another gem in Montreal with delicious Asian fusion food! Our waiter was a sweetheart and was helpful as well. The pad Thai was great and the fried rice, trying their peanut sauce is a must"}
{"text":"This is possible one of the worst Asian restaurant I have ever visited. Food is terrible , price is extremely high."}
{"text":"Just regal food like in food court , nothing special but expensive. It is not worth you money."}
{"text":"Très bon. La serveuse à qui j'ai parlé quand je suis venue était absolument au top, alors merci à elle ! Cela donne toujours envie de revenir quand le personnel est sympa. :)"}
{"text":"The only nice thing I can say about this restaurant is that it has a terrace facing Atwater Market. We waited 1.5 hours for our food only to discover that it was tepid and less than mediocre. Learn from my experience and give this one a miss!"}
{"text":"Ever since I became a vegetarian the thing I've missed the most was sweet and sour chicken balls. When I discovered that this restaurant had a sweet and sour battered tofu I was eager to give it a try. The General Tao tofu, and the a l'orange version, are absolutely fantastic; they satisfy the craving completely and are incredibly morish.

Back down to Earth for a moment, I've been there five times now and the service and food constancy are extremely INconsistent. The sides seem to change depending on who cooks the food, which feels lazy rather than necessary. Wait times are usually very quick, but I've waited over an hour before, with no apology, explanation, reassurance, or attention (with a fairly empty house.)

Overall I still go back once a week, but there is definitely room for improvement."}

Wait times at this location are much slower than the Atwater location, but the food tends to be just a touch better. Given the choice I'd usually choose the Atwater location; the slow, slow service at this one is just brutal, and the wait staff is remarkably inattentive. I've waited over an hour before, with no apology, explanation, reassurance, or attention (with a fairly empty house.)

Overall I still go back once a week, but there is definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"The worst Asian food I ever had, can't believe it.  This place has a nice corner location but food tasted aweful even the pad Thai sucked."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack. The dumplings were okay. Shrimp chips seemed stale."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not great. Had the calamari has an entrée and the wok and chicken peanut sauce as a main dish. The wok and chicken was room temperature (not hot) and the taste as a bit bland. You could taste the peanut but nothing else. The person I was with had the Tom yum shrimp soup. There were 3 cocktail size shrimp and it was not spicy at all. The menu indicated it was very spicy and a good one is supposed to be but here it was not. Only good thing is the decoration in the restaurant which looked nice."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with my daughter (a vegetarian).    It's right across the street from the Atwater Market, which is where we originally were going to grab a bite but we saw this place and curiosity got the best of us.   The restaurant is very pretty inside, kitchen is one long open grill.

We were delighted to see that almost everything had a vegetarian option on the large menu at the front door.    Something odd about the place though.....they only take your order at the table after 3:30 pm.   If you're there for lunch, you have to line up at the cash and give your order directly to the cashier where she gives you a number to place on your table.    Easy enough, but the service didn't get much better.    It took AGES AND AGES to get our food.    There are only 2 guys working the grill and each order is done individually.    So if 10 tables are waiting ahead of you, you're going to wait.

The food - she had Shanghai noodles with tofu, I had Pad Thai with chicken.
Both were quite good, large portions.    We'd go back any time for lunch, as long as you aren't in too much of a hurry  :-)"}
{"text":"Small portion, very expensive, good quality, kind staff. Don't recommend it for the food, worth exploring thought. They say it's a fusin of Asian food, seemed like normal thai restaurants to me."}
{"text":"Made a stop after some sweet jazz in the Heineken tent during the Montreal jazz fest. Our experience was pleasant and efficient. Just a quick stop so only tried the thai basil and the red curry chicken. Both dishes were excellent lunch plates. Tasty, hot and fresh accompanied with a cold sleemans and a pleasant server and my week at the jazz fest continues to impress!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner last night during the Fete Nationale.  Was seated right away at the bar as I was dining alone.

Ordered Tom yum soup and pork dumplings. The dumplings were fantastic.

For my main course I had Thai basil chicken. It was really tasty but I should have asked for a bit more spicy.  

For a very popular night the kitchen was was quite fast and the bartender was quite attentive to everyone sitting there."}
{"text":"Small, but reasonably priced and solid service. The General Tao's chicken tastes pretty good but heavily sauced - maybe a bit much. Wife enjoyed her tofu, except one piece was \"oddly hard\"

Overall happy with dinner."}
{"text":"I've tried this restaurant twice. I really wanted to like it because the ambiance is so cool and it's not too far from my house.

The first time I ordered an assortment of foods, all bland and dry. 

The next time I ordered one of their meal soups and it was terrible.  I think you would get better soup if you bought one of those dry noodle bowls at the grocery store... you know the ones you add water to. It was extremely salty and tasteless."}
{"text":"I'm giving Sesame a 5 star rating for not simply the food but more for the customer service. I go to Sesame regularly for their vegetarian General Tao tofu. It is the ONLY place I have EVER found that does it right! It is *not* the mushy watery sponges of soft tofu most of the restaurants serve, it is prepared in the same way as the General Tao chicken is with a crispy batter and sweet and sour style sauce only with lovely firm cubes of Tofu in the center.

Now, I promised that this was a review not only of the food but of the amazing customer service I have received there. On occasion there has been a mixup with the food ordered, it can happen to the best of us. On this particular occasion unfortunately a pice of chicken found its way into to order I had just picked up to take home for dinner. When I called the restaurant from my house, despite remembering my order and being perplexed as to how that could have happened, they took me at my word, and offered to make me a fresh order AND deliver it to my house personally (even though delivery is not a service they offer). It got here about 15min after I called, still too hot to eat! It was kind of amazing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, ok food.  Ordered the Tao poutine which was very tasty. The salmon tartar was tasteless which is strange since she asked me if I wanted it spicy and I said yes. I had to ask for salt to add to it. I ate it but only because I was very hungry. The spare ribs were decent as were the dumplings. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"General Tsao tofu is excellent, sweet and flavorful. Singapore noodles with tofu was good but spicier than expected (for a dish not advertised as spicy)."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was horrible. Waitress stood next to our table and waited for us to tip. I tipped 15% of a $20 bill. She refused to let me get up and leave and said that it's the law to tip at least 20%... let's just say I've never been cornered for a toonie before. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Situated in the Atwater market, this little gem was a great discovery for me. 

I ordered their chicken pad thai. Although the noodles were a little bit overdone to my likings, the taste however was quite savoury. It had a variety of vegetables in it to my surprise which also adds to the flavour. The chicken was average; in hindsight I should've tried it with shrimp maybe that would've make it even better. Overall, I had better pad Thai but that is not to say that it wasn't good.

It is a great restaurant for vegetarians. Their general Tao tofu are to die for (a vegetarian take on general tao chicken). People can get very wary about tofu but trust me, as a meat eater, it was delicious. They also have a Asian fusion poutine that I haven't tried yet. 

Lovely ambiance, tasty food, vegetarian friendly, and an interesting drink menu; this is a lovely restaurant that I would go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Le service est très bien. Par contre, je n'ai pas trouvé la cuisine bien exécutée. J'ai pris un pad thaï et il était très ordinaire. Les nouilles n'étaient pas assez cuites. J'ai aussi commandé un cocktail au kombucha qui semblait extraordinaire vu la description du menu. Il est arrivé sur la table et ce n'était rien d'autre qu'un verre de Kombucha décoré d'une minuscule feuille de coriandre. Pas digne d'un \"cocktail\" à 5$. Cette cuisine n'a rien d'authentique. Je n'y retournerai pas et je ne le recommande pas."}
{"text":"I went to Sesame just last week when I was in Montreal working. It is on a popular section of St Catherine with lots of pedestrian traffic and as it looked pretty busy, I thought it was a safe bet. It was on a Wednesday evening when we stopped in and although it was busy we had no trouble getting a table outside for 3. Service was fast and efficient right from the get go and we ordered a pitcher of sangria to start. The drink was ok but nothing extraordinary.  One of my dinner companions ordered the pad thai and her teenage daughter had just the shrimp tempura. I went with the shrimp rolls and a red curry shrimp dish. The shrimp tempura arrived first along with the fresh shrimp rolls. The tempura looked pretty small but maybe that's not a bad thing as the large tempura you get in some places just means more unhealthy batter anyway. The person who ordered it said it was good. The fresh rolls were a bit disappointing. They tasted nice and fresh with a wonderful peanut dipping sauce but there was barely one shrimp in the whole roll, just one or two shrimp bits. I would just get the vegetable ones next time.  My dining companion didn't say anything about her pad thai so I can only assume it was ok and like her I ate my red curry dish without making much of a fuss one way or another. It was overall good but not a great dining experience. I would give it 3.5 stars if that was an option. I do think it's better than 3 but not quite in the 4 category when I compare it to other Asian restaurants where these same dishes are often superb and cheaper. Many people will probably enjoy the good location though as it is a good spot to people watch."}
{"text":"Great service, drinks, and location - if only the food were better

I was in the mood for Asian flavors and came here for lunch after visiting the museum catty-corner across the street. The decor is fun in a modern cafe kind of way, the service was excellent, and the drink I ordered - the Sakerihna - was herbaceous, not-too-sweet, sake perfection.

But what pulled me into the restaurant - the spicy Thai chicken wings - is apparently no longer offered. So I went for the only other spicy dish on the menu - the Thai basil stir-fry with shrimp  - and it was just OK. Not particularly good nor bad and certainly not spicy it did fill me up...which I suppose is something.

In short, if you are looking for a fun place to hang out and get some snacks and a few drinks with friends I would recommend this place. But if you want to eat good Asian food I strongly suggest walking the three blocks over to St. Laurent Boulevard."}
{"text":"I came here for my anniversary with my boyfriend and wasn't disappointed! First off, the ambiance and decor is great. I love every single detail down to the little clothespin they used for the bill. We both had the Bao (steamed pork buns with salad and fries) both of which were very tender and good. I loved the sauce that came with the fries and the salad was pretty good as well. We also both had small soups for our starters; I had the Tom Yum and my boyfriend had the Pho. Again, both nicely made! The service was pleasant as well. I'll come back on a Wednesday to try their specials!"}
{"text":"Je suis arrêtée là lors du festival Montréal en Lumières et malgré la ligne d'attente à l'avant, nous avons trouvé place très rapidement. 
Le menu est très varié et donne envie de le commander en entier. j'aime aussi les restaurants comme celui-ci où il offre la possibilité de prendre un menu pour deux style dégustation. J'ai mangé un rouleau de printemps aux crevettes et le poke bowl thon et saumon. Les petites sauces sont révélées et donne beaucoup de goût. Il y a aussi une belle sélection de cocktail. Le service est rapide et les gens sont souriant!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance and service! TV should disappear. Great pork dumplings. Good wonton soup. Very good Berry Wellness tea! Would recomend it."}
{"text":"I didt like the food. C un attrape touristes. My dumplings was dry, my pad Thai was horrible...was vegetable inside and a kind of sweet tomatoes sauce. I don't like to do not good review but sorry my experience was not good. My glass was dirty also so I had to ask the waitress to change my glass.the restaurant looking is cute and the waitress was sympatic . I will not going back there"}
{"text":"The kids menus are great.

The decor is nice, I found the 'adult' dishes a bit bland, but I do like my food spicy.

Also a tad expensive, but you are sat and served at the table.

Service was attentive, mind you they did see me using yelp on my phone 

Worth trying on a rainy at Atwater market"}
{"text":"This place was a great place to go eat some great tasting food and in a great setting. 

Soup broths can easily be too salty. However both soups I tried at this establishment were just right. 

Of course their signature dish General Tao Chicken is a must try at least once. 

I will be going back again and encourage others to try it as well."}
{"text":"Très bon! La serveuse était super gentille et nous a recommender des plats qu'on a beaucoup aimer. Je recommende les dumplings au boeuf et crevette, les spare ribs en entrée et le general tao!"}
{"text":"Asian fusion
Be careful what you order. My boyfriend ordered some fried vegetables and rice. It was very ordinary but I had the general tao poutine and it was so good. A mix of sweet, salty and spicy with very crunchy fries. You should try the drinks too!"}
{"text":"Pourquoi me rendre chez Sésame et ne pas y manger de la typique nourriture Thaï? Pour y manger la meilleure poutine au général tao et un des meilleurs tartares au saumon. Toutefois, bien que demandé épicé, le saumon manquait d'épice et leurs frites sont très bonnes mis toujours beaucoup trop salées. Demandez peu de sel quand vous les commandez et elles seront parfaites."}
{"text":"Ever since our visit here in December, my daughter is now a fan of vegetable dumplings. The service was amazing and the attentiveness to my child really made me appreciate the experience."}
{"text":"Very nice staff even though i can barely speak French, good curry and fine beer
overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Super bon service, si t'es un mâle vraiment alpha tu veux demander un pad thai épicé. J'ai pleuré ma vie. 5/5 will come again."}
{"text":"Great service!  Best General Tso I've had!  Good wine selection with good wine at reasonable prices. Good indoor / outdoor seating. And GREAT service!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good atmosphere.  Had a few kid friendly dishes as well as a kids menu.  They were fast and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"We had the chicken pad Thai, coconut curry, and the peanut chicken.  They really give you a generous portion.  All of the dishes were good, but the pad Thai was my least favorite.  It didn't taste very authentic."}
{"text":"I went there with friends we were a big table of 10 and I wasn't expecting nothing because my friend told me that it's a place you go when you want a lot of options. Because we were a big group some people are vegetarian some are celiac so it's the place to go if you want to please everyone. I was nicely surprise, the service was amazing the food was well seasoned even if all the dishes are classic well know Asian/occidental dishes. We had a great time and we all finished our plates."}
{"text":"Started off good and went downhill very quickly. We got the set menu for $33/person and the first three items that came out was good. The fried calamari was very tasty but when the 3 entrees came out (pad Thai, curry, beef, one bowl of rice to share between two people) the food was mediocre at best. We were disappointed and left a lot of the entree untouched on the table. I've had better food in the mall. The service was great but unfortunately the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Excellent rapport qualité prix dans une ambiance urbaine.   Cuisine assez copieuse et très bon service."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian so I love finding places that do that sticky, sweet version of Chinese food (General Tao-style) but with tofu. 

This place does that!

It's a wee bit expensive but that's ok. It was really good."}
{"text":"Poutine et général tao dans un même plat le paradis quoi!!! Beau petit restaurant excellent choix pour les familles ou un repas à deux"}
{"text":"The best oriental restaurant i have ever been to. I'm from miami and came to montreal to experience new things and this restaurant had the best pad tai and fried rice. The wontons were amazing as well. Also the service was amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"They messed up my order and did not fix it or bring the proper order after the mess up."}
{"text":"Je marchais dans le coin du Marché avec une amie vendredi, en milieu d'après-midi. L'estomac dans les talons, on s'est arrêtées ici pour du bon manger. C'était notre première fois à cette succursale de Sésame (j'ai essayé en oct. 2012 celui sur Saint-Jacques). 

En rentrant mon amie me pointe vers \"la poutine au Général Tao\". Ayant toujours de la difficulté à choisir devant un menu offrant plus de 10 choix, j'ai pris ce signe comme un appel de l'Haut-Delà (faut dire que je suis uen grande fan de poutine et que j'avais un méchant craving de poulet Général Tao). Bingo, ai-je pensé.  Mais je n'ai par contre pas tant apprécié le plat.  La sauce était beaucoup trop salée et pas assez chaude pour faire fondre le fromage (qui d'ailleurs ne faisait par squik squik). Les frites étaient un peu trop fines à mon goût (comparables à celles de McDonalds). Et les bouchées de poulet ne ressemblaient pas au bouchées de Général Tao que l'on voit ailleurs... cerains morceaux n'étaient même pas enrobés de sauce!  J'aurais mieux fait d'aller chez McDo justement pour une DIY poutine aux croquettes. ;-) 

De son côté, l'amie se prend un rouleau de printemps végé bien simple, accompagné d'une délicieuse sauce aux arachides, et un plat de Poulet au cari rouge.  Le cari rouge est tout aussi décevant que la poutine. Peu goûteux par contre. Tous les éléments semblaient avoir été ajoutés dans le bol juste avant le service... ce qui fait que le goût et la texture du plat (\"comment un poulet au cari rouge devrait être\") ne sont pas tout à fait au rendez-vous. Selon elle (que je soupçonne experte en la matière), celui du Thai Express est meilleur!

L'endroit est superbe avec ses grandes devantures toutes fenestrées et ses boiseries qui recouvrent entièrement les murs ornés de petits miroirs dépareillés... J'y retournerais peut-être, mais seulement pour un verre et un rouleau par exemple... si je suis mal prise."}
{"text":"Premièrement, je trouve que le menu n'a pas âme, bcp de copie il n'essaie pas évoluer. Ambiance du restaurant est génial des grande table pour des groupes, j'ai quand même aprecier mon expérience 6/10"}
{"text":"Wednesday night we had a great experience. Service was great we were seated right away party server of four. Kids had dinner pad Thai noodles and beef teriyaki. The pad Thai noodles were a little spicer than we're accustomed to but still fantastic. we had the small plates Wednesday night special pork button ribs, salmon tartare, red curry shrimp. All of which were off the charts. The only thing I'd change would be to have the tartare first because the shrimp and ribs over powered the tartare. Nonalcoholic beverage Chinese Medicine was a must. By plan this was just a snack for Mom and dad. We went out to another restaurant later."}
{"text":"After seeing a show at lace des arts we looked for a nice vegetarian / vegan friendly and the Yelp app. suggested this one :) 
The staff were really nice, since my wife is vegan and she wanted to make sure the soup she ordered is vegan they actually brought her a list of the full ingredients from the kitchen to make sure she is ok with it. Amazing.
We ordered the tom-yam soup which was  extremely good, the sweet and sour tofu I ordered was very good but not more then that. We also had a couple of non-alcoholic cocktails which were too sweet but still nice (and only 6$). Overall great experience, a bit pricey but you get what you pay for right ? will defiantly consider re-visiting"}
{"text":"Lovely and cozy restaurant with excellent food! Awesome general Tao and beef chow mein. It is strategically located and is not that expensive and the attention was fast and great!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm over priced for its poor quality.. Place and service is nice but the food is not impressive at all.. Whatever you do, try to stray away from the dumplings as they lack in flavour and presentation.. We had ordered the pad Thai extra spicy and it came lacking in flavour.. Tasted like boiled noodles with lemon.. The general Tao was o.k. But overpriced for its worth.. We were seated on the terasse and when we went inside to wash our hands the waitress inside asked us why we are using the facilities and that they were reserved strictly for clients, when I advised her we were seated at the terasse, she went on to question me and ask: are you sure..."}
{"text":"On Thursday April 13 just after 8PM: The place only had a few occupied tables when we arrived. The servers were friendly. We seated ourselves in the east corner, in front of the window. The best seat in the house. Famous last words.

We were 2 people. We ordered Hunan dumplings, fizzy water, a Sesamito cocktail, pad Thai, and a pulled pork bao. Drinks arrived quickly. Cocktail was good.  Then came the dumplings which were tasty but, just okay for me. I love dumplings so know of better places to have them where they are juicy and flavourful. No big deal. Our mains should be here soon.

Then came the wait...and wait...and wait...the server eventually told us about 30 minutes after we finished our app that the mains were coming. Did we want another drink? No thank you.  Fine.  40 minutes after finishing our app, the final straw for us came when a table that had arrived quite some time after us and ordered after us got their mains (including a Pad Thai). We'd been patient enough but no more. We were hangry and frustrated so we got up to pay for what we had. They had the courtesy, at least, of not letting us pay. Fine. Our food was finally ready and they offered to give it to us to go. Too little. Too late. Unfortunately, what began on such a positive note, ended on anything but.

I hope they figure out where the screw-up occurred so that it never happens again. Was the order not put in? Were our mains given to another table (as someone's pitcher of beer almost landed at our table)? Was the kitchen distracted by the hockey game?  Did they forget us? What gives? 

It's unfortunate really because we have passed by the restaurant on many occasions and finally decided to give it a try. Maybe once I calm down enough, I may eventually give them another chance. Given the vast choice for Asian restaurants, however,  i wonder why i should even bother. We'll see, I guess."}
{"text":"Lumiere tamisée comme j'aime, bon service, bcp de tables et places au 2eme etage. I like."}
{"text":"Great location for this restaurant. It is very near the Contemporary Art Museum. We were in the mood for Asian and Asian fusion hit the spot. We started with the mix of dumplings- they were good, although the pork ones were strong. We had the salmon poke - nice presentation with a good amount of salmon, although it was smaller than the picture in the menu. I had the general Tao chicken- really tasty flavor and just a little more than I could actually eat. The vegetables were fresh and I would order this again. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé ce petit resto dans le quartier des spectacle. 

Nous étions sur la terrasse, spacieuse et bien assit confortable.

Les entrée sont de bonne portions pour un restaurant asiatique. J'ai l'habitude des restaurants de ce genre qui ressemble plus à des tapas. Pas ici.

Nous avons essayer les raviolis arachides (j'ai oublié le nom). Personnellement, Je n'ai pas aimé plus qu'il faut mais ma compagne à adoré. Je suis très difficile en matière de bouf et les sauce arachide ne sont pas pour moi, alors ce n'est pas que c'était pas bon, Je n'aime juste pas cela.

Comme repas, j'ai pris le wok poulet général tao. Une bonne portions de poulet non gras avec la sauce du général tao, beaucoup de légume et salade. C'était vraiment très bon.

J'y suis retourné avec d'autre amies. Elles ont tous adoré leurs plats et surtout la qualité et quantité pour le prix. Je recommande."}
