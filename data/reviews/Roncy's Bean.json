{"text":"I've been here first time yesterday.I'm happy to found Cappuccino with really foam on the top.I believed that they have it because I saw ''Italian Coffee''  on a board in front of shop's then it was.
The Shop has decorated cute European taste.
Separate washroom with Man&Woman.
There are TV,some big table for group.
Artists works on the wall. We can buy them.

I had nice talk with friendly staff. 
They have fun for eyes and tasty.
I feel fresh because sometimes artists works has changed when I came back.

We can watch UEFA EURO 2012 match on TV at there."}
{"text":"The coffee here is not great and the service very indifferent. I know this place used to be a second cup and it still feels like a second cup, totally bland."}
{"text":"I always walk past and one day my regular places were closed so I went in. The owner was having a very loud conversation with someone at a table. I ordered a sandwich, which looked promising but tasted off. The deserts look mostly pretty stale. The space has potential, but something just seems a bit off. I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"This new business is located in the former Second Cup. It opened in early December. It is in a good location, and seems to be an improvement over the previous coffee shop that was once here year's ago.

The atmosphere is alright, but the owners obviously utilized much of the former Second Cup's decor. If you are going here to write your latest masterpiece on Yelp! you may need to fully charge your batteries, as there did not appear to be an abundance of power outlets in the place.

The Americano I ordered was good, but not a good as some of the more specialized places, if that's the correct description, like Lit or Capital Cafes. next time I will try their drip coffee, which seems to be their speciality.

Good place to people watch, as it has three tables that face Roncesvalles . Good addition to the area."}
{"text":"A wonderful substitute for the Second Cup that used to occupy this wonderful location. Fresh squeezed lemonade and orange juice, with a killer Gelato Bar. Incredible patio and service."}
{"text":"The old Second Cup location, I think. It's still got that feel on the inside, much less like the new indie-coffee shops in the city (woody, long counters, and reallllly cool barristas). Americano was 2$ flat and fairly bland (using a roaster from Oakville, I believe). My favorite part was the orange juice machine you see all the time in Europe but not so much here. That orange juice was awesome."}
{"text":"Last weekend, we were walking down Roncesvalles with our cute pooch when we spotted two people sitting outside of Roncy's Bean with gelato. We had planned on going to get some coffee but after asking my husband what he would rather have, it was decided that we would 

Going in, I was happy to see a LOT of gluten free options. I'll have to come back again soon to try their baked goods and their coffee. 

So... the gelato. Points for it being made in house. 

It was good. It wasn't great... I got the hazelnut gelato, and found it to be grainy. Initially I passed it off to it being home made, but a google search seems to indicate that \"freezing an unchilled mixture will result in big ice crystals and a grainy gelato\". 

It wasn't unpleasant, and I ate it all... I would just rather had a smooth product. 

Hubby got the rum and raisin, and he liked it... but he's like Mikey, he'll eat anything (there I go showing my age again....)"}
{"text":"I come her for coffee, to relax, or study regularly.  Great place, very nice and friendly service.  Coffee is good, I especially like their fresh pressed juices."}
{"text":"What an excellent cafe! It balances everything someone would want in a cafe, and quite well - you can't say the same about every cafe in Toronto, that's for sure. 

It's a great place to hang out by yourself or with friends, and the hours are super - open until 9pm. The coffee is great - be sure to try their cappuccino, but the espresso and drip coffee are good too. . The baked goods are absolutely delicious, especially the scones. The staff are always hospitable and happy to chat, if they have the time. The food is quite good as well - had their schnitzel panini the other day, it was delicious.  

Best part? Not a sneer in the place. That's important, given what's happening to most independent coffee shops in TO, wouldn't you say?"}
{"text":"I was just short of blown away by the quality of service, and the coffee. I'm surprised to see some low reviews.
Had a drip, which was possibly the best coffee I've had (not an uber coffee freak, but I like a damn fine cup of coffee). 
Someone I was with ordered an espresso, which I had to try. It was awesome; rich, smooth, good texture and flavour.
As for their service, after about 10 mins of conversation, a man, (whom I assume to be the owner) gave us all a free round!
Oh, and free WiFi."}
{"text":"It seems like a calculated business decision to make a MEH, drab and generic place that makes the old folk put off by the hipster places more at home. Unfortunately this means really horrific taste in decor. It feels like a place that would have been the height of contemporary fashion when 90210 went on the air. The reviewer that mentioned an airport coffee shop was dead-on. The patio, though, is rather nice. 

The coffee tastes stale, weak, and sour. That's the worst part. The pastries look very uninviting, also with a costco whiff about their PERSON. All in all, you are better off at Starbucks up the street. Service is very friendly, though."}
{"text":"Went in to get a snack before a movie. Were not acknowledged by staff, but hey, it was after 9. Ordered a cheddar sandwich. Cashier took her time cashing us out and seemed kind of out of it. She finished the cash transaction, then wiped down the counter and finished what looked like cleaning the frig and area, between chatting to the other staff person. Perhaps they were bored, since the two other customers looked like they'd been there a while. The other staff person bussed tables and washed a few dishes. It was five minutes after our order that they started to make the sandwich and when we saw what it was, we wished we hadn't bothered. A large dinner roll, mild cheddar (like No Frills quality, not that I dislike No Frills but for a $7 sandwich you'd think maybe medium cheddar?) and some sun-dried tomatoes out of a cold jar. No mayo, no spice, lettuce, nothing. She very, very, slowly and methodically used a fork to get them out of the jar a strand at a time. We waited for the panini grill to heat and for her to flip the sandwich a few times so the bread got nice and tough. The staff had a warm and animated chat with each other; I was happy for them.
Took 14 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich, and it was almost inedible. Ate a few bites of the middle, which was cold so the cheese wasn't melted at all, couldn't eat the dry bread and oily tomatoes.
Should have just eaten the popcorn at the Revue.
The coffee was old btw, and a bit sour. Maybe serves me right for not ordering a specialty and getting something fresh.
Generally off-putting service, quality, and value. I've been told the gelato is good, so maybe I'll try that if I return. (After all, what can they do to gelato that they don't make on site?) I probably won't bother when there are so many better places on the Roncy strip. (Next time Alternative Grounds? Lit? Any suggestions?)"}
{"text":"I'm confused by this place. Wandered in one day to check it out... wha??? where am I?? Am I at Pearson? Because this coffee place feels like a coffee place in an airport. It's that boring, that drab, and has that many \"pastries\" that look frozen, week old, and are wrapped in cellophane. The decor is just terrible. There are TVs. Oui. And the biggest, weirdest thing? Took me awhile to figure it out.... THIS IS THE FIRST COFFEE PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO THAT DIDN'T EVEN SMELL LIKE COFFEE. It was very disturbing. I wish them well, I'm glad that there is a \"local\" biz in this spot again, but it doesn't feel local, just plain and generic. Maybe the older people in the neighborhood will like this place? But if that's the case, why not just make it a Tim's?"}
{"text":"Best Panini's I've had since Italy. Friendly staff and lots to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"I am not much of a coffee connoisseur so my 4 stars reflect the non caffeinated goodies and the beautiful patio at this local cafe.

I went there after a depressing trip to my doc and was immediately cheered by this place: the servers, the gelato and the homemade cookies. 

it was the eve of the Portugal-Spain Euro'12 clash so there were lots of locals discussing the match. There was a buzz throughout the cafe.

The cashier was very cheerful and chatty, and served us very amiably. I absolutely enjoyed the homemade butter cookies  (a lady from the neighborhood makes them) with a tone of walnuts. We enjoyed the cookies so much that we bought out the rest of the cookies on our way out!

The pistachio gelato was quite good as well, though a tad over sweet. Sitting in the shaded and comfortable patio (really comfy chairs with cushions), it felt like we were far removed from the hustle bustle of TO. Props to Roncy's Bean for feeling like an oasis of calm!"}
{"text":"Roncesvalles is one of my favorite little areas to take a little stroll or bike. I met with a few people to go to Roncy's Bean for gelato. Atmosphere is cozy and the staff was friendly. We each picked out our gelato and surprisingly the best flavor was Terroni which was excellent. Nice caf√© type place -I would go back."}
{"text":"I can definitely do a Coffee crawl along Roncesvalles and get perky from drinking coffees from all these coffee shops....

Roncy's Bean was not as busy as the Alternative Ground just south of it so I decided to order a Americano ($1.90) to stay. Price is decent when I just paid the same for a drip coffee just up the road at Starbucks. Barista is friendly, asked me to have a seat and deliver the coffee to my table.

There is also a little fireplace with armchairs at the back of the shop, great to chill out with friends and maybe my friend can watch the sport channel while I daydream?!"}
