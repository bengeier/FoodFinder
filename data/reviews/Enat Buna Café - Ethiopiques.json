{"text":"This place does NOT deliver, even though it says it does on the Yelp page. Sorry, you lose my business. Also, consider having someone who speaks English answer your phone."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend because of the great ratings. We both love trying new cuisines but this was just the worst place ever. When we went inside we were seated right beside the window. The first thing that my boyfriend had to do was stomp on a cockroach!!! We ordered the meat and veg platter and when it came out it was completely cold. The bread I was not a big fan of because it was also cold and bland. While we were eating .....2 to 3 flies landed on our food. We were both so grossed out we did not finish the food. There were cockroach droppings everywhere, including on the glasses they gave us water in.... And worst was the pricing for this food! We paid $47 honestly we could have had better food for that price. This has totally turned me away from Ethiopian food.   Also if you have trypophobia (fear of holes) the bread will freak you out!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Ethiopian cuisine, I've tried almost all the Ethiopian restaurants in the city, from the critically acclaimed ones to the mom & pop shops. With regards to the food this is better than all of them except for Sheba (at College/Bathurst). Though I've been here twice in the last week and starting to think the food here may actually be equal to Sheba.   Time shouldn't be an issue when dining at Ethiopian restaurants as they all take a little longer to prepare, especially if you're ordering mixed platters, so this place is on par with the rest in that respect.   Service is very informal and less attentive than Sheba, but I'm less picky than most about stuff like that, so that puts this place 2nd on my list of Ethiopian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great variety. Mind-numbingly slow service."}
{"text":"Perhaps I am ignorant about Ethiopian culture as this is my first time trying their food, which I heard is great, but this place is very disappointing. It is dirty, for one. The seats are so disgusting. I think they try to hide the state of the place with their dim lighting. Not working. If you have plans for afterwards, cancel them. Not only is the service terribly slow - it took 40 mins to get ice for my drink, but you will leave the place smelling like their food and smoke (not cigarette smoke, but burned food smoke).  You can tell by the length of this review that I am bored sitting here waiting still... Granted I am using a Groupon review so perhaps their service is sub-par for folks like me. But the place is still nasty. Not a good look for Ethiopian people. Just sayin'.  Update: the absent-minded server brought me the wrong food. I specifically asked for chicken tibs and she was telling me that its supposed to be meat. After I politely repeated myself, she agreed to bring out the correct order. If there is no such thing as chicken tibs option, then why put it on your menu? Very disrectful tone! What if I had a dietary/ religious restriction?? *smh* Let's see how long this takes....  Update: When she brought the correct food, she was still muttering that its supposed to be lamb, traditionally and most people order it that way. Did I ask? And then she proceeded to scrape the lamb off of our big communal plate from which my bf was already eating. And the bottom of the plate she was using to collect the lamb was completely touching my food. Disgusting.  I refuse to believe Ethiopian cuisine is so terrible. I will try again some place else. But def never here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious Ethiopian food, this is a great place! I have been there several times and was there for a late dinner again last night. Had the vegetarian platter and really enjoyed it! All of the dishes were very flavourful and they added a (7th) dish to the platter that I don't recall having before. It was amazing!  The service was a bit slow but otherwise good and I only go there when I am not in a rush. It is a great place to lounge around with friends over a long relaxed meal."}
{"text":"This is a medium sized restaurant located in a quiet downtown neighborhood.   The food is good, but inconsistent sometimes. Some days it will taste better than others. Some days you will ask for for an item and they will say;  \"yes, we have it, but not today!\".   With that said, this place is excellent in terms of food when it is made well. The injera portions are plentiful, and the services beats most other Ethiopian spots.   The food does take longer to arrive, but you need to keep in mind it's not McDonalds and Ethiopian food does take longer to prepare.   Servers are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed.    This will continue to be my go to Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto (others I have tried include Nunu, Nazareth, M&B Yummy, and African Palace).   Tip: Try the assorted veggie platter with a meat of your choice."}
{"text":"Our first experience with this restaurant but I had Ethiopian food before The service is very very slow unless you know the servers or a regular or Ethiopian  Why? We sat there for fifteen minutes before our server gave us water  The regulars came in, sat by the bar and got their drinks immediately  She did explain some of the food afterwards  But the food came out (salad) after 30 minutes while the regulars and the waiteess's boy friend got beer and she made herself a coffee before starting her shift   The food is quite salty . We had LAm, chicken dishes and they are okay but not fantastic.   But if you are in a hurry or expect decent service , you have to go somewhere else"}
{"text":"A humble place to get some tasty food.   I actually thought the service here was pretty good, the lady who served us was very kind (and brought us more injera when we needed it). I must admit I haven't eaten much Ethiopian before but we cleaned the platter! Only thing that lets it down a little is the interior is a bit drab and dated."}
{"text":"Delicious food, quaint atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff. I vegetable and meat sampler dinner was outstanding. The bread had a wonderful flavor"}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian in the city. Try the stuffed jalape√±os, ginger tea, lentil soup,  and everything in the menu. Service is slow but that seems to be common with Ethiopian restaurants."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian I've had in Toronto. Platters are fresh, flavourful, and super ample. Martinis are good and strong! Owners are kind and genuine. Decor attractive, clean, and inviting. We really enjoyed ourselves. :)"}
{"text":"I bought a teambuy deal for this place because I love Ethiopian food and live just up the street. I was really excited to check it out and add another Ethiopian place to my options. I arrived with 2 of my friends, and we ordered the veggie sambusas and a vegetarian platter (all 3 of us are vegan). We waited a long time for the sambusas but didn't mind. We all took a bite of the sambusas, and I immediately spat mine out and said that it tasted and smelled like beef. We waited for the server and double checked with her. She glanced at the sambusas and assured us that it was just lentils. My friend ate an entire one, and I had one more bite. I then refused to eat any more because it smelled and tasted just like beef. I hadn't eaten beef in over 10 years, but I know what it smells like. My boyfriend went to the back with one and asked again, and the server then took it and ripped it apart and announced that it was beef. She then came to our table and opened the others, and they were all beef. She was very apologetic and even told us that they would take the beef sambusas off the menu so this mistake could not happen again. I would give them a 2/5 since I believe it was an honest mistake, but I am giving them a 1/5 for additional reasons: we had to ask more than once whether or not they were vegetarian to discover they were not, the menus had not been updated in what looks like years, the restaurant was freezing, and the service was extremely slow (we arrived at 8 pm and didn't leave until after 9 pm, so it took almost an hour just to get our appetizers). The service was friendly, and the server was very apologetic, but my boyfriend and I will not be returning to Ehtiopiques again."}
{"text":"Very good food, subtle variations in spice and heat level. Very friendly staff.  The service was not rushed but they were attentive when required.  My new favourite for Ethiopian downtown"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Sunday. We ordered one vegetarian and one meat lunch special for two people plus soup and salad. Everything was very tasty, flavorful, and zesty. They don't shy away from the spices but nothing was out of control, except for the salad which had fresh jalapenos chopped up in it. I thought it was fantastic, but I can see how that might be a little much for some. The beef dish served with the lunch special was incredible.  Service was very friendly. Our food did take a little while to arrive, but we could hear them in the back chopping our salad so we didn't mind at all. Great place to have lunch if you have a little while. The prices on the lunch specials are a great deal especially considering that we were so stuffed we didn't eat anything else for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Ethiopique was a first for me....  Not the first time I had Ethiopian food, but the first time I left a restaurant after getting bad service from beginning to end, and feeling sad for the place.  The restaurant was half empty when we arrived for dinner.  We stood at the doorway for at least 15 minutes, while the server/hostess walked passed us a few times, avoiding all eye contact. - Was she hoping we would leave if she ignored us?  Another 10 minutes passed before we were sat at a dirty table. - Was this table cleaned after the last guest? - Where are the settings or napkins?  20 minutes passed before she took our order - We looked around and saw other patrons were looking around, wondering when they can be seated/order their food/get their food/get their bill.  35 more minutes before the food to came. - Gave us a chance to study our table clothes and concluded we likely sitting at a dirty table.  15 minutes to get the bill   Service was extremely slow and comically absence.  The setting was surprisingly nice, for that part of town.   Dim lighting and tasteful poster of Ethiopia adorned the walls, giving this place an intimate feel.  In reflection, the food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.    Unfortunately, the service over shadowed the whole experience and made it go from ok to bad.  We ordered items from across the menu so we could try everything.  As expected, everything came on one big platter which made it hard to distinguish what the items were.    When we asked the server if she could tell us what the items were, she rolled her eyes and gave a big sigh.  Her answers were short and unfriendly, and gave us the impression we were a bother.    This lack of information made this meal an adventure.  With each morsel, we were never quite sure which meat we were going to be eating, nor whether it will be a spicy morsel or a tamer one.  We decided to skip the coffee ceremony, as the night was not progressing positively.  We decided to cut our losses and laugh this off as an experience for the book.  Getting the bill was an also excruciating slow.  We watched our server spend a lot of time calculating and recalculating the bill and still got it wrong.  Items were overcharged, and there were additional items on the bill that we did not order.   Until today, I thought shows like Restaurant Makeover or Kitchen Nightmare were heavily edited, to make the restaurants look incompetent, and the makeover more dramatic.  After today's experience, I've changed my mind.    I really wanted to like this place, but the service received killed any chance of a return visit."}
{"text":"Today was the second time that we went to Ethiopiques as a family for lunch. The veggie platter as always is great. We asked for a plate for 3 for a family of 2 adults and 3 children (5 and under). More than enough, as for the second time we couldn't even finish the platter.  I was only disappointed that we were charged the regular price at lunch time, instead of the advertised lunch special of $6.50/veggie platter for 1. I guess I should have ordered that specific deal? I didn't bring it up with the owner, as I really like coming here."}
{"text":"For those of you who have never had Ethiopian cuisine, prepare to get your hands dirty. There are no utensils and it is very much a communal dining experience.   When I checked-in on Yelp I noticed that there was a 50% off deal for anyone who checks in! I showed it to the staff and they were genuinely happy to see that someone redeemed the offer. My girlfriend and I had the meat platter and it was delicious, especially the Lamb Stew. Not the best Ethiopian food I've ever had, but it is very good. Service could have been quicker. Overall, a good restaurant nearby Dundas Square."}
{"text":"This was my first time at an Ethiopian restaurant.   The woman who served us was nice enough. She was patient while we (my friends and I) took our time looking over the menu.  Can't say I'm a fan of sourdough though, of which there was plenty. My meat platter didn't taste good either.  Vegetarian platter was decent though. Give that a try, even if you like meat. They don't do meat well here."}
{"text":"Some very unfair reviews here, not sure if expectations were too high.  I've been to this place twice and both times the service was \"good\" bordering on \"very good\".  The most recent occasion had us ordering a couple of platters for two, and doing the coffee ceremony.  Everything came out very quickly, even though the restaurant was about half full.    Good food, good service, decent value and excellent coffee ceremony.  A good, less cramped alternative to Ethiopian House."}
{"text":"The best serviced and food Ethiopian restaurant I've ever been to. I've tried many on Bloor and Danforth but this small place downtown beats all, despite all the negative reviews. I am crazy about Ethiopian cuisine and after trying all the restaurants in town, I conclude that I will  be only going back to this one. If you're a vegetarian, the veggie dishes tastes amazingly flavourful compared to other Ethiopian restaurants. The only negative thing I'd have to say is I'd prefer the injera to be warmer than the temperature it was served."}
{"text":"Went there for round two, brought a friend, empty stomach, and a Groupon!  Definitely addicted to curries and Ethiopian foods! will continue to explore Toronto's Ethiopian food community. =D  Service was great, the woman is very patient and is well worth the tip!  Single Veggie platter filled both of us up!  *Note - East African and West African foods differ, If anyone has found some Ghanian food PLEASE message ASAP! =D"}
{"text":"If it wasn't 6pm I would have definitely tried the Coffee Story, or whatever it is called. For $6 you get coffee and some kind of performance/presentation on the history of coffee or something. I love coffee, and a coffee-themed short play that comes with coffee sounds great! Maybe at lunch some other day. There are a bunch of vegan stews, like the Spicy Lentil Stew, Fasolia, Yellow Pea Stew, etc, but it was my first time and I wanted to sample everything. I ordered the Vegetarian Platter for One. It was way too much food. Plus, there are no utensils except crepe-like bread that you grab food with (injera) and I really sucked at it. So, I ended up eating a ton of injera bread with little bits of stew in it. The six items in the stew varied from blah to yum, with most being in the middle. \"Mild lentils\" really lived up to its name. The Spicy lentils were great. But I should have picked something on the menu and maybe the portion would have been smaller.  At 6 on a Monday it was quiet, a few tables arrived as I was going. Service was quick, the background music was pleasant, and there was no room for dessert."}
{"text":"Of 3 or 4 ethiopean restaurants I've tried, this place by far is my favorite.  The waitress is very patient and courteous to explain and recommend foods that suited our palettes.  The dishes were all very delicious and plentiful.  Despite the cooking style, both the lamb and the beef dish I've tried were tender and richly flavored.  Give the Kenyan beers a try!  They taste quite light despite the 4.75% content and clenses the palette for their spicy dishes quite nicely.    It's quite a gem of a restaurant for the downtown core."}
{"text":"Love the food!!  If you want to try out something different you must check it out. I think ive been 5 times now, the food is fantastic, and feels like someones grandma is cooking with love."}
{"text":"Pretty good Ethiopian that rivals my personal fav, Ethiopian House. The cuts of veggies are a bit larger and coarser but it works well. Nice spice combo in the vegetarian byanatuu. This place has a cleaner white table cloth look than your typical Ethiopian joint. The neighbourhood is otherwise kind of sketch."}
{"text":"Came here after Pride as a group of seven. We loved both the veg and meat platters. Husband and wife owners are  very nice. Service was excellent. Delicious food to accompany our Kenyan beer Tusker."}
{"text":"This was a nice homely restaurant with really good food. The focus of the restaurant is on the food and not the general ambience. The owner likes to do things right. A personal conversation with all the patrons is part of the overall experience. The food is very good and is an experience in itself.   The food is served on a shareable platter that can be shared amongst several folks easily. Loved the food and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is the tastiest Ethiopian food I have ever had! Definitely worth checking out. I had the meat and veggie combo for two. The spicy dishes were especially flavorful. The server was very friendly and gave good advice on the combination of dishes and portion sizes (the combo for two easily feeds three). Their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food - 5/5 - Food as good as it can get! Our first Ethiopian experience and was a great one! Service - 3/5 - The staff could be more welcoming."}
{"text":"Their meat and veggie platter is awesome !!! The soft injeras come with six vegetarian dishes and two meat dishes ... Each one is delicious !!! Three different lentil dishes....each one has its own distinct flavor and three different types of vegetable dishes... Wow !!! My favorite is the Fasolia with beans and carrots. Chicken Doro wat and  Lamb Tibs are super yummy. The restaurant has a nice warm and cozy feel. Service is nice and polite. I would have given them 5 stars if service was quicker."}
{"text":"Ethiopiques was a very welcome surprise for us. We would never have stumbled upon this place on our own. The reason for our visit was really just to use up the WagJag voucher we bought ($20 for $50 worth of food). We ordered a Meat Platter, Gored Gored (Tender beef fillet) and Goden Tibs (Lamb short ribs). The meal was more than enough for 3 starving yuppies. We still had a bag of take-out after we stuffed ourselves to the brim. It was our first time eating Ethiopian cuisine. We liked the exotic flavor from the variety of spices. Some dishes had a spicy kick to them so have your water handy. The food is served with injera (similar to rolls of airy crepe/pancake). You use the injera to eat the foods with your hands, without the use of the spoon or fork. So that was also fun!  We also requested the coffee ceremony after reading the reviews in Yelp and Googling about the ceremony. Apparently, coffee originated from Ethiopia. They bring out the roasting pan when they're roasting the beans and shake the pan in front of you so you can whiff the intense aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans. The host will bring the jebena (clay coffee pot) to your table. Then, she will slowly pour the coffee to the small porcelain cups. Sugar is provided for you to sweeten the coffee to your taste, but not milk. The coffee is meant to be drank black. A basket of popcorn is also included for you to munch with your coffee. It was definitely a memorable experience and great way to cap off the night :)  http://monkeyseemonkeyfeast.blogspot.ca/2012/08/ethiopiques-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"I have to admit the atmosphere was great! However, the decor in the washroom was inconstant with the rest of the restaurant (I guess that doesn't matter to everyone). It was my first time trying Ethiopian food, and I enjoyed it very much. I had the meat and veggie lunch special. The portions were fairly large. I ended up taking some home and having it for dinner. The only real complaint I would have would be the waitress, she was very awkward. Since it was my first time trying Ethiopian food, she was unable to clearly answer questions we had. We ended up ordering the lunch special, because it seemed like the safest choice."}
{"text":"Got a deal on one of those group buy sites so decided to try this place. In this particular case, the offer did exactly what it was supposed to, bring in a customer who'd never imagine trying out the restaurant in the first place.  the lowest rating i can give for this restaurant is 3 because I have not tried any other Ethiopian restaurant. Did I enjoy it? sadly no. I do pride myself in finishing most of it, lentil soup, sambusa, meat platter, tomato salad. Unfortunately, I can deduce that Ethiopian cuisine relies on an extensive use of spices and the flavor is very intense, so if you don't agree with it off the bat, it won't be a very pleasant dining experience.  If there was an Ethiopian fusion restaurant I should probably have tried that first just to prepare my palate til the time I can take on the real stuff. Nothing was bad, just not my cup of tea.  *service was sub par. slow with not a lot of attention given to the ONLY customer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Living at Church and Shuter and being a gigantic Ethiopian food fan, my girlfriend and I would take the walk up to Yonge and Elm St for Ethiopian House on a regular basis. Little did we know, located at Church and Dundas was a hidden Ethiopian gem. This place is really hard to see, and though we walked by it hundreds of times we never actually knew it was a restaurant.   The atmosphere is friendly, the decor is suitable and the service is excellent. For anyone who has eaten at Ethiopian House before and loved it, I strongly suggest this place. It's equally as good if not better, with more generous sized portions and a lot faster service. Our server also treated us to a free serving of the Ethiopian coffee that requires 30 minutes brewing time.   Ethiopiques has just opened and I will be telling all of my friends about it. Incredible food and an incredible experience."}
{"text":"Guys, guys, let's be fair now.  If you come to this place on a schedule, you may end up in tears. It's true. But this isn't the kind of place you come to on a schedule; you don't even get cutlery, for god's sake. You eat with your hands, with a shared platter, and a friend you're very comfortable with. And you dig in to the food (when it gets there) and savour every bite of that long-awaited meal.   I had the meat and vegetarian platter, which I found to be quite good. Especially tasty on my end were the green string beans choice and the tibs. I literally cleaned up. My friend unfortunately did not enjoy his half as much, finding that the meat platter didn't have too many choice cuts. Maybe it's different for just a meat dish.   The service was not effective nor impressive; the servers seemed tired and maybe sad. But I was nice to them, and the server smiled a little and was kind, despite the glacial pace. Maybe it's part of the communal dining experience (forcing you to talk with your companion for about 2 hours, that is). Or maybe the kitchen is run by a single little old man who makes every dish to order, from scratch. I don't know. But so long as the food is okay and the waitresses are genuine, I can be patient.   I might come back if I wanted to show an old friend a new experience, and we were within 10 minutes walk."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's not terribly fancy, but the food is just as tasty as any Ethiopian place I've been. The price is also very reasonable. I go here a lot, it's great for vegetarians.  The service is typical of more casual restaurants: speed of service varies, but the staff are generally very friendly and warm."}
{"text":"Loved the food and thought the service was good too!! I love wine with dinner and their selection surprised me - from local to international. The only turn off was the fruit fly invasion, its gotten out of control ( hope they take care of that soon ). I took my husband there for the first time and he was rather turned off by it; we had to fight them off all throughout our dinner. The whole restaurant could use a good cleanup but I guess its only an impression you get during the day since they dim the lights really low for dinner time. We had the Chicken Stew/Dorro Wa't which was simply delicious, and the Chicken Tibs/Dorro Tibs which I found wasn't really chicken (after picking a bone that looked like rabbit or something..) - after inquiring I found out it's actually a hen! VERY OILY. We also had the vegetarian combination platter and everything was full of flavour!"}
{"text":"Very comfy restaurant no matter where you sit. Warm and inviting. Love the smell of the incense! Prices are reasonable for the portions you get . We had the vegetarian platter for two which was delicious , just not very hot when it came out. I'll go back though as the staff were nice and the food was tasty!"}
{"text":"I went to Ethiopiques tonight with a teambuy coupon $19 for $40. We ordered a meat platter, vegetarian platter, and sambusas. Alot of food for 2 people! It took us to around $40. Great deal either way!  some of the meat dishes had bones, but nothing offensive. And the meat wasn't fatty, which I appreciated, because it's covered in sauce!  The seasoning was flavourful and not too spicy.  The service was friendly and helpful.  I found the sambusas slightly bland, but my friend really liked them.   The entrance is slightly dark, but the inside is nicer than I expected.  Prices are reasonable. ($14 and change for a platter)  I will return to Ethiopiques!"}
{"text":"Overall: : Interesting restaurant to try but probably a place that I'll only try once. Total cost for 2 was approximately $50.  Setting: Sleepy cozy spot with interesting African music. Washrooms and stairwell smelled bad and musty.  Service: We were greeted immediately by the owner and given a  He took our orders and was very helpful with explaining the menu. With that being said, the food service was fairly slow since it did take a bit of time for the food to arrive. Not a very busy restaurant with only two people working at the front.  Food: We ordered one meat and veggie platter and one meat platter. It was more than enough food for us. Both dishes were delicious and filling but I wasn't personally a huge fan of the bread? The taste of the food doesn't stay in your mouth which can be a good or bad thing. We also tried the African beer which wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at Ethiopiques and I have to say that the staff were a big part of that. Some Ethiopian restaurants I've seen some pretty unwelcoming service, and I can say Ethiopiques I thought the service was above and beyond, and the best service I've received at an Ethopian restaurant. I found them welcoming, attentive, and considerate, leaving me a warm fuzzy feeling.   I thought the food was good, better than average. Not the best Ethiopian I'd ever had, but more reasonable and I felt it was good enough value for the money, that I would return. I loved their injera, but a little bit of the meat was super tough. I heard some yelpers complain their food arrived cold, mine did not.   13$ a person / platter"}
{"text":"Had the meat and veggie platter with beef tibbs and lamb rib. The injera was missing the slightly sour taste but had the right spongy texture. The price was $18 a person or $36 for two. Overall the food was good, but the meat portions seemed slightly small. Some other reviews call the food spicy but I didn't find it spicy at all.   The staff was very warm and friendly.   The coffee ceremony was a lovely treat as well. Worth the $10."}
{"text":"Ethiopiques I noticed was recommended by quite a few people. I have been there twice now. The first I went there for dinner and the second time for lunch. It was a huge difference! During dinner, it's hard to notice the unclean and shabby interior; with the lights on the decor looks slightly decent. The meal was good- The dora fir fir was delicious and flavorful. When I went there for lunch, the  entrance looked so shabby in the daytime, it felt like I entered a restroom. The ambiance in the daytime is unappealing and made me uncomfortable. The food was bland and lacked flavor. I had the meat platter for $14.00 and received a good portion of food but not flavorful.  This place is over rated. They surely need to clean up."}
{"text":"Oh boy...   We were seated fast enough but the waitress didn't greet us or make any eye contact when she handed us the menu. That's right, no eye contact when giving the menu - her head was turned away looking at her co-worker set up the table next to us. Ok fine, no big deal.  We gave our order, 2 appetizers, 3 meat dishes.   When the first two meat dishes came out, some parts were warm, some parts were cold! Obviously a microwave job - horrendous! I've been watching a lot of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares lately and that is just an absolute no-no for a restaurant to operate! The worse part was when we told the waitress about the two meat dishes, she only took one back to, what I can only assume, re-microwave. I thought she might take the other dish to warm up once the first one was done but she didn't and she threw the meat back onto our plate as though she was annoyed with us! We didn't want to be a bother and remind her the second dish is also half-cold so we kept mum.  Our third dish, lamb, that came on a hot plate was sure to be hot - great! But to our surprise, it was mostly fat on bones and any lean meat pieces were burnt to a crisp. We didn't eat half of that dish.  All the dishes tasted mediocre to bland.  Someone on this board also commented about the incense smoke in the room. Yup, it's true. The scent is unpleasant and we smelt like it when we left.  The only redeeming qualities: the male waiter was nice and charming (he was helping us at first before the waitress tend to us), the soup (which I'm sure was also microwaved) and sambusa (appetizer) were good and only good, nothing more.  We will not be back - we'll stick to Pero's ethiopian food."}
{"text":"As always, when eating here we feel like part of the family.  The service is incredibly friendly.  But the food itself always surpasses expectations.  The injeera is perfectly spongy, the lentil soup is incredible, and the red lentils (misr wat) is always my favorite.  The steak tartar is made authentically, though, so be sure to let your lovely chef know if you want it a little milder than they would eat it.  We've tried almost everything on the menu, and would eat everything again."}
{"text":"Had a dinner date there, experience did not match up to the company... The ambiance of the place really did fall flat from their attempt to make it fine dining or intimate. Food was edible but does not warrant the price. Service was slow and didn't care too much for the state of the washrooms. Overall, a forgettable experience even though it should be a memorable one being a first time trying Ethiopian food..."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The starter was WAY too greasy and the main dishes were either bland or too spicy. The bread is interesting and quite tasty. I also enjoyed eating with my hands!   The service isn't the best--slow, even when the place is empty. Server is also not too friendly."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun coming in this place.   The restaurant is nicer than the typical Ethiopian place, albeit the entrance is minuscule and not easy to find. The light are soft and the lady that serves is very friendly and helpful.  Group of 4, three of which never had Ethiopian before. I prepared everybody about the food, the injera and the absence of silverware. When one of my colleagues order a lamb plate, the lady asked him if it was his first time and then said no (sounding like the kindergarten teacher with a kid) and suggested something else (less extreme?).  Another one tried with a different choice, same question from the warden, then she agreed to mix it with something else. The Doro Wat was really great."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday night for dinner with some friends. Although we made a reservation, we didn't have to, as we were one of only two parties dining there that night. The restaurant itself is very cozy and comfortable; a good atmosphere for an intimate dinner. Only 1 waitress was working that night so service was a tad slow; don't come here looking for a quick meal.   Since this was our first time trying Ethiopian food, the waitress recommended the platters - I split the meat and veggie platter ($29 for two people). The platter was huuuuuuuuuge; it would've fed 3 people quite comfortably. On the platter, my favourites tended to be the vegetarian dishes (especially the lentil dishes) as the meat was a bit dry and tough. Injera was served on the side, and is (I presume) unlimited. To eat, rip pieces of injera and use your right hand to pick up small portions of stew or salad. Injera is a sourdough-based flatbread, and has a slightly sour flavour - definitely a bit of an acquired taste.   At the end of the meal, the waitress was nice enough to give us a complimentary piece of warm baklava - although they don't make it in house, it was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"The food is OK, not the best I've had. Could've used some more salt. We got seating quickly despite it being a weekend. Prices are good. Bathrooms are a bit dirty. The coffee is good but remember to order it in the beginning of the meal. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"My friend invited me for dinner this past week, as she wanted to try Ethiopiques which she passes quite often. Although she is Eritrean herself, she does not care to go out for Ethiopian food very often, and then only to her few preferred places. I, however, like to go out for Ethiopian food, and have tried many different places on the Danforth and downtown. So this would be a rare outing for us... but unfortunately it fell very short of expectations, mainly due to the very poor service.  The restaurant itself was pretty standard for the places that I have visited, not too bright inside, a few decorations on the walls, and seemed quite clean. It was not busy, so the service started okay, and the food came fairly quickly. After that though, the server kept missing everything, possibly because he would visit several tables without ever writing anything down. My friend ordered a spiced tea, and got iced tea instead, then waited about 10mins to get the actual spiced tea, which she said was just the spices and water with no tea at all. We requested both salt and more injera twice each, but never got either. The people at the table beside us seemed to be having similar problems, towards the end stating quite loudly that this was the worst service.  As for food, we ordered the vegetarian platter, with a side order of lamb tibs. I usually have the platter as it includes a little of all the vegetables: lentils, chick peas, yellow split peas, collard greens, and cabbage and potatoes. The food was okay, but nothing special, and certainly not the large quantity that I saw in their website photos; my friend also insists that the 'collard greens' were definitely not, and probably actually chopped kale. The lamb was pretty good, but again no better than I have had elsewhere.  Overall, I thought that the food was a 3-star rating. The bill came to about $40 for two, and I would definitely say that I have had better for less. Coupled with the very poor service, I cannot see myself going back again. There are certainly better options available along the Danforth."}
{"text":"I grabbed a teambuy deal to try Ethiopiques. For $18 I would get 1 appetizer, 2 mains and 1 dessert. Whoohoo!  Ethiopiques is located on Church St...a little more south than the Village than I had envisioned.   When we entered the restaurant around 7pm on a weekday, there was one other couple seated. There was also alot of smoke in the room...for the love of our lungs, open a window up in there! Me thinks they went a little too crazy with the incense.  The service was slow but very friendly. She upgraded our entrees to the veggie and meat platters, which I thought was very generous of them considering I had already paid on a team deal. The food itself was great!! Comparable to Adis Abbaba, and bigger servings than Nunu's. They also give extra rolls of Injera (you don't really need them, but again, its generous). Regular prices of the platters are around $13.  I had a good meal. The question is will I return...for takeout yes. It would help if they jazzed up the inside a bit more (and opened a window). The location is good given its 2 min walk from Dundas square."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner around 8PM and was seated almost immediately. Once again, super happy with the warm service (they made us feel like family), but so-so about the food. We ordered a vegetarian shared platter for 2 again and the flavors are impeccable as usual, but this time the portion size got even smaller. The toppings are not served directly on a plate with injera rolls served on a small plate separately.   This I actually liked more, as someone trying to control my portions and salt intake lol. Also I don't feel compelled to eat all the injera that the toppings are sitting on in addition to the extra rolls even though I did it anyways - they give us another plate of injera rolls, which we almost finished. The female owner also graciously offered to give us seconds for any toppings of our choice, but we felt pretty pretty full by this point.  $14.99 per person. 3/5 stars for mediocre value - go to another Ethiopian restaurant (eg. along Danforth) you'll find bigger portions and a less expensive bill."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had been wanting to try an Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto for a while and last week there was a coupon available through teambuy. So what better time to try then when the food is cheap!   We ordered lentil soup, the spicy lentil stew and fasolia. All of the dishes were excellent and with all that protein we couldn't finish our meals. As the stew suggests, it is spicy. I personally thought it was the perfect amount of spice, but depending on your tolerance you might want to try just the mild lentil stew.   If you haven't eaten at an Ethiopian place before your table can eat off a common plate. And you eat your food using the injera and your hands. This experience is one of my favourite parts about this type of cuisine. The waitress did ask if we wanted a common plate or not, so I am assuming you can each get your own if you aren't sharing or are a germ-a-phobe.   Other great things are the atmosphere, the service (the waitress was very friendly) and the price. Between the two of us we couldn't spend the entire teambuy coupon if we wanted to.    A couple things to keep in mind when you go are: - If it is your first time, this place can be a little difficult to spot, so have a watchful eye.  - If they aren't too busy, go to the back to grab the waitresses attention, otherwise you might be waiting for a while before they notice you.  - If you are driving, there is parking on the off streets. It is $2.50 an hour.   Enjoy the experience. =)"}
{"text":"You have to like injera a pancake like rubbery bread substitute or this is not the place for you or me. My partner and I continue our rediscovery of dining in downtown Toronto   Each week one of picks a place to eat, always a different place in a moderate price range. It was my turn and I though it would b interesting to try Ethiopian food.   The atmosphere is nice, service is friendly and laid back. Even with my reading glasses the menu was almaost impossible to read the colour scheme is very poorly designed     We ordered the meat/vegetarian platter and some sodas. The large pizza platter arrived at our table and besides the size of the platter the amount of food was disappointing. There was; one really small chicken leg, a tiny piece of lamb, a few shards of beef, a splattering of three different lentils a little cabbage around a sprinkle of boston lettuce with some cottage cheese on top.   I tried eating with the injera but it didn't sit well with my stomach so I ate what little there was with my fingers. The food was very tasty. For someone like me having an option to substitute the injera for pita would have made a huge difference.   At home eating toasted bread and some cheese cause I'm still hungry!"}
{"text":"Back for round 3.. Great as always, though some of the dishes were a bit on the pureed side this time - not sure why that was.  And the salad side (got the meat & veggie platter) was a little heavy on olive oil.  But the rest was fantastic.   Service slow as molasses - pretty standard for Ethiopian but for some reason last time was much better.  Even though they weren't busy, when I asked for the check, it still took over 10 minutes to come!  It would also be nice to have some background music of some sort - it's *very* quiet in here.  Not a big deal if you're having a conversation, just striking when you first come in.  This review's probably a 3.6/5, so I'm still rounding up to 4, but it's in danger of slipping a bit if the food quality drops any more..  Btw - a nice touch - this place offers keff injera as an option (not just the standard keff/flour mix).  A nice change - and more authentic!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went here with our two kids. The found was really, really good. We had the lentil soup,the sambusas, and the veggie platter for two. Everything was fresh and very tasty! The kids loved everything, especially the soup. Overall, a really great meal. And the person helping us (perhaps the owner) was incredibly welcoming, and so nice to our kids. It was a great night!"}
{"text":"Food was decent here (not as good as Pero, for instance) and service left a lot to be desired.  They took forever to bring out the food (we're talking at least 25 minutes) and when they did, they messed up my order and completely forgot the dish I was most looking forward to.  I was so hungry that I didn't bother to order it again (especially after that wait) and just dug into the food that did come out.  It was good, but there are better Ethiopian places in the city, and Tropical Palms next door is much tastier (but unfortunately is not open the same hours)."}
{"text":"Our first time at an Ethiopian restaurant,  we stopped in on a whim. So glad we did! The food was absolutely delicious, fresh, just wonderful. The service was great very friendly. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I ordered via a delivery platform. I asked for gluten-free vegetarian platters. Just to ensure I got the right order, I called to follow up. I was passed on to the owner who acted as if I were a bother. She said the ordering platform computer was turned on by mistake and they didn't mean to take my order (yet I was never contacted). She said there was no gluten free bread  (again, she didn't call to tell me this and perhaps cancel the order). Ok, so what did this mean? She'd give me one (instead of 3) pieces of injeera. I said \"fine\". When the food came, there were only bird-food sized pieces of injera that cracked from being too stale when I tried to use them to scoop up food. It was so bad, so old, I couldn't eat it. It tasted freezer-burned and 10 days old. The rest of the dishes were bland. It was error after error with no apology. Never again."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. The meat and veggies plate for two used to have a base layer of injera and was covered in food. Now they don't have the base layer of injera and their portions are skimpy. The food is excellent but for $40 I expect to be full and sadly I am not anymore. I won't be coming back because it's disappointing to see them cutting corners!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie and meat platter, was good pretty tasty, especially the meat. The bread was good, not so convenient to eat my food with because I'n not used it and it was fun! And the waiter was nice enough to bring me a fork when I finally gave up.  Waiter was really nice which is why i'm giving it 4 stars. For the food i'd stay 3 gor taste and 4 for price/quality.  Overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out based on a video I saw on \"The Toronto Star\" done by Black Foodie blog founder Eden Hados.  There were 3 of us, none of which have ever had Ethiopian food.  Upon entering this establishment we were warmly greeted by the owner who we came to find out would also be our server for the evening (SCORE!).  We looked over the menu and everything sounded wonderful but we didn't know where to start or what to order.  The owner asked us if we were interested in sharing, as this is the custom and whether or not we were meat eaters (this place is great for vegetarians by the way).  We responded \"yes\"  and \"yes\" .  He grab our menus and told us he would put something together for us.  We trusted his judgement (he would know better than us right?) and I am so glad we did.  He brought out the largest platter of food I have ever seen!  The food was amazing! The amount of spice was perfect.  The combination of flavors were very complimentary to each other. At one point we were definitely FULL but for some reason we kept grabbing more injera (flatbread) for more bites.  There were some greens, different meats, lentils,  corn etc on the platter. We loved every bit of it! Since the owner prepared it specifically for us,  I don't know the specifics...you'd have to ask him!   We almost finished our entire platter but we took what was left home and the owner kindly offered us some injera bread for our leftovers.  My husband went to pay the tab and the owner gave him two free \"shots\" of Ethiopian liquor (again, you'd have to ask him what it was) which completely made my husband's night.  Thank you Ethiopiques for the amazing food, ambience, and service!  Oh and the price point is perfect!  We can't wait to return when we are in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"The place was empty so we got very fast service. Ordered the meat and vegetarian platter for 2 and it had a taste of chicken, meat and some cooked vegetables and seeds such as carrots, lentils ams chick peas. The meat was spicy amd very tasty. Prices were affordable and everything was delicious. Excellent location."}
{"text":"Cheap, simple, ok. Not quick.  I think there are new owners, and the quality control (and frankly the understanding of English) has dropped. \"Non spicy\" and \"no jalape√±os\" means there shouldn't be jalape√±os on it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch, and while the place was pretty empty, which worried me at first, I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the vegetarian bento box, which comes with a choice of four veggie dishes, but what came was actually a bit more than that. They decided to let me try a small sample of all of the veggie options, probably because it was such a slow day for them. The food was delicious, it came served on their traditional injera bread, with more rolled up on the side to eat it with. My favourite of them all was the red lentil dish that was a little bit spicy. The only thing I didn't enjoy very much was the salad, which was a little too garlicky for me even when taken in bites with the other choices.   The man who served me, who I gathered was the owner, was very nice and didn't even laugh too much when I asked for a fork to help me, because I knew I would only make a mess trying to use just my hands like you're supposed to.   I would definitely recommend for a nice affordable lunch in the area!"}
{"text":"Call before you go. Although they have opening and closing times, I've encountered the restaurant closed during business hours on multiple occasions.   Of the few Ethiopean restaurants I've been to, this is by far the best. Not just the food but the staff is actually very friendly.   I highly recommend trying Ethiopean food if you haven't and if you're going to do it, do it at this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time I ever tried Ethiopian food and must say I liked it as different from anything I have tried as it was.3 of us had the meat and veggie platter in order to taste as many different things as possible. Portion was quite big and managed to fill all of us.We also had the traditional coffee service which wasn't really special,just very strong bitter coffee and they burn the stuff used in churches next to the coffee pot which doesn't have the nicest smell. The place is quite small and nothing spectacular but the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I always walk by a lot, but have never tried. This would be my second time trying Ethiopian food. I came here on a weeknight. The location is very convenient as it is on Church and Dundas, very close to the Eaton Centre. The outside of this restaurant is not very attractive. Inside the restaurant is also just passable, but it was comfortable and spacious. The server was nice and friendly and the service was average. I thought it took really long to get our food. But when the food came, the food was good and flavorful. The prices, in my opinion, was en par with other restaurants of this type. I liked that the server kept bringing out the Ethiopian bread that you eat with the food. We had to tell them not to bring more. I really liked the lamb short ribs that we ordered. Overall, it was a good experience and I think I would come back when I am in the mood for Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4 because I enjoyed it and don't get many chances to eat Ethiopian food!  They were pretty empty on a Sunday night when all the other places I walked by looked packed, but fortunately that was not a bad sign!  Got the meat and veggie combo.  Nothing was over-the-top spicy which my stomach will probably thank me for later.  Perfect amount of food to leave filling somewhere between full and stuffed."}
{"text":"Absolutely deserves 5 stars.  The food tasted amazing.  We got a meat and veggie platter, which came up to $16 per person.  Next time I want to try the veggie platter.  It was all delicious and not too spicy.  They also give free refills of the bread.  The service was awesome.  The staff was so kind and friendly.  The ambience was decent too.  Would definitely come back if in the area!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what they put in the long beans, but they taste amazing!  Service is wonky. I had to ask 3 times and wait about 40 minutes before I got my tea."}
{"text":"Yikes!!! What a disaster this place is. We read the reviews before going and figured it would be OK but were mistaken.   The service was absolutely horrible!! There was no one in the place and the server saw us but still took several minutes to seat us. He proceeded to screw up the order and once he fixed it we never saw him again for the rest of the night. There was no coffee service or anything. The food was luke warm and dismal.   The men's washroom was horrible. Both toilets were broken. If I didn't know better I would say that this place is about to go out of business.  There are tons of good Ethiopian Restaurants on Danforth East. Go there if you want a good Ethiopian experience but stay way from this horrible place!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Meat and Veggie platter for two. It was SO GOOD. Service was great and Fasil is very friendly. The chickpea gravy served with the platter was amazing...If i could get the recipe , I would cover all my food in that gravy. Since we liked it so much, Fasil gave us another serving, which we greatly appreciate !  Amazing meal. would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Ok, so when I first tried this place it was such tasty food, and it was my first experience trying  Ethiopian. The Lady that served us was so nice and friendly, she went through the history of Ethiopian culture, food and coffee and that really helped us select what we wanted to eat.  I told my sister about it and we decided to go back as she really wanted to try this cuisine.  We called to make reservations but were told that we didn't need any for two people. We went for Saturday Lunch, but the door was closed. We called the restaurant and no one would answer. We walked around the area, came back and still the restaurant was closed.  We then came back after a month to give it another try and the restaurant was still closed! We peeked into the big window and saw a HUGE fly inside the restaurant buzzing around the window. The fly was probably half the size of my thumb. LMAO  we both looked at each other and ran for the hills. :'D"}
{"text":"Our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along. I'm very pleased we went! Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a \"salad\" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal.  We each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though.  Once we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian).  We asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate. They also served it with a large basket of popcorn, which was just perfectly prepared. It was such a nice after dinner snack! I would totally come here just to order the coffee!  It would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the coffee was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends. Make sure they're good ones, that you don't mind getting messy in front of!"}
{"text":"Tried to do something a bit more adventurous as a group and we ended up here at Ethiopiques for a group of 6. Reservations went alright but they had no record of it, the host managed to put together a booth in short order. The place has ample seating and can seat a group up to 20 people with ease.  Food compared to other Ethiopian places is not as tasty, lemon was a bit overpowering in some dishes, but it was clean and relatively fresh. Aside from that, almost all of the dessert items were out of stock and the drink prices were a bit high for a place like this."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently. The service was a bit slow but very friendly. The decor and environment were relatively simple. Food was quite good and very filling if you get one of the combo platters. I would to again.  This place is also vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"My two-star rating is certainly a standout amongst the sea of fives.   Will start off with saying that this was my first time trying Ethiopian food, and perhaps it just wasn't my style. I have no baseline. However, neither my boyfriend and I liked the food. The meats were pretty good and flavorful with a bit of a spicy kick (lamb, beef... watch out for bones). The vegetables were more lacklustre but I found myself returning to the beans, which sat in a nice sauce. Regardless, pairing it with the injera made for an awkward taste. It's a bit of a sour soft bread, and the taste is pretty off-putting with anything. Probably an acquired taste.  You will be full. The portions are big. $50 for two people, but we would have had more than enough if we ordered the plate for one. We both came hungry but the food was enough to make us lose our appetite.  The Tusker beer is a bit sweet, pretty ok. I would say pass, especially given the price... unless you simply want to try it for the sake of trying an African (Kenyan) beer.  Other aspects - very hospitable staff, felt like you were being welcomed into their home. No complaints on that side - in fact, one of the best service experiences I've had, Enat was fantastic. To be fair, we were the only diners throughout our short stay here... so service was very fast and we were nicely attended to.   Atmosphere - sat in a cozy booth at the back. Certainly doesn't have a clean or \"upscale\" look, but I suppose that's consistent with the \"authenticity\" of dining in a family-run place like this. Our light right above our table kept flickering on and off. No points docked for that, I'm not picky.  I'm willing to give East African cuisine another go but I am hesitant now."}
{"text":"Good food, very authentic and exotic. For sure worth a try. Also the coffee ceremony is a must have!"}
{"text":"Awesome Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto. Staff was incredibly friendly. Ordered the vegetarian sampler as I always do in Ethiopian restaurants. The beber dishes were much better than most. The veg dishes were pretty good. Portions were dope. Brought extra injera upon request. Real good experience."}
{"text":"First try at Ethiopian cuisine after being suggested into it by a friend. This is an easy to miss restaurant located at a short walk to Dundas Square. When we entered for dinner, it was fairly busy with only 1 table left empty. The owner of the place was very interactive and asked for feedback after every dish tried and gave good suggestions. We ordered Sambusa, Timatim out of which we liked Sambusa esp the spicy sauce on the top. Timatim was the only dish we didn't like in the meal as it turned out to be extremely tangy making the bread difficult to eat. For main course, we ordered a Veggie Platter for 2 but the quantity was good enough to share between 3. Ingera - Ethiopian bread was served with it and it was a different experience trying it with gravy and vegetables served on platter. It was a good experience.."}
{"text":"*1.5 stars*  Located at Church and Dundas, this Ethiopian restaurant tries to be a more upscale joint, but unfortunately, it really isn't. There is some attention to detail, yet it is not wholeheartedly thought out. The dim lighting and tablecloths attempt to imitate an quiet, close, and intimate ambiance in the dinner room, but the bright lighting from the kitchen's open entrance glares through. There are wine glasses for water, but there are [price] sticker marks on it. Which brings into question on how clean this place is. (The server did give us new water glasses.)  The place was not very busy when we entered, nor was it when we left. We arrived on a Saturday evening. There was a couple in the dining room when we entered, and when we left, there was only one other table dining in at the restaurant. However, a reservation is preferred, as I was told when I called to inquire about the restaurant. (I did make the reservation.)  Service is extraordinarily slow, and the food that arrived was not particularly memorable to warrant the price, or its overall experience. The female server is polite and friendly, though absent-minded. Somehow managed to forget two of our dishes. We reminded the server about our forgotten dish, but it never arrived. At that time, it was just one dish that was forgotten, and the server appeared to have genuinely forgotten and apologetic, so we chalked it up as an honest mistake.   With the wait and since we had other plans after our meal, we ended up on declining on the other dishes (if it was in the process of being made at all). The server tried to encourage us to stay, but during our conversation with the server, we realized she had forgotten another dish we ordered. Since our group of four and another couple were the only patrons in the restaurant, I had a hard time believing she could forgot our simple order of four dishes. Or, easier yet, she could have written it down all those times we repeated our order.    We ended up eating only one of four dishes we ordered. The meat platter dish. What good I can say about it is that it is fairly large with a good variety. I have heard that some days the food is better than others. This was not a particularly good day. That said, there are much better options for Ethiopian food with swifter service and better prices at several locations a few minutes away. Arguably, better food, too.  ---  Note:  And, even with the realization that some diners had coupons, I cannot think of anything about this place that makes it worthwhile. (There is better pricing with consistently better Ethiopian food elsewhere in the city.)  The only reason this place warrants 1.5  stars is because it may be a good place to introduce people (of the non-food-venturous, and simply wants to \"dip their toes\") to Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Amazing. I came with my girlfriend for her birthday, and everything from the prompt service, to the coffee ceremony (a must-try), the ambiance, and the food was perfect. The service was attentive, welcoming, and friendly. Although the food took a little longer to come out, it is definitely worth the wait (extremely affordable as well). We even got a slice of cake on the house! My first time trying Ethiopian food, but definitely not the last. I will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for some tasty and unique home-style cuisine. You don't come here for the ambiance, but for the good food. If you've never had Ethiopian food, you should know that you eat with your hands. You receive a delicious spongy pita-like bread and you scoop all kinds of delicious stews from a large serving platter. So, this is a good place to go with a group of close friends, but not a good place for a first date.  We were a large group of people and we ordered the Meat and veggie Platter at $18 per person. It was a good value, although the portion was not very big. All the stews were very delicious.  There was good variety and some good balance of savory, spicy and sweet. Especially tasty were the lentils which had nice spices in them like cinnamon, and also had a nice kick. Also the lamb was very delicious, but it was not a lot of meat. When we finished the plate, the waitress came and asked if we wanted a second helping of veggies and proceeded to bring a generous helping of the delicious lentils.   Keep in mind that one simply does not go to an Ethiopian restaurant without ordering the coffee. As Ethiopia is the reputed birthplace of coffee, Ethiopian restaurants take their coffee seriously. You preorder the coffee before the end of the meal, at which point they roast the coffee beans in a pan in the kitchen. Partway through the roasting, they bring the coffee out for you to smell the smoky aroma. They then bring out the coffee in a traditional pot with popcorn on the side! In some Ethiopian restaurants they also bring frankincense on the side to complete the smoky experience. It's a beautiful thing.   The service was nice and friendly. The waitress wore traditional Ethiopian garb for a more authentic experience."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food! Every thing else is delicious as well! and staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a unique experience, you've come to the right place.  Ethiopiques, located just outside of the hustle and bustle of Dundas Square, is a hidden gem in the midst of Toronto. Now I may be biased because I'm a colossal fan of spicy food, a main part of Ethiopiques carte du jour.  I absolutely loved how they do not use silverware. Your food comes out on a massive injera (flatbread) and is used for dipping. When you are there with someone else, it really brings you closer to the meal as well as closer to your companion. With a nice drink menu I would suggest a bottle of wine to pair alongside.  If you're looking for something new and exciting, give Ethiopiques a shot. Beware the timid."}
{"text":"As far as Ethiopian food goes, this place has good food and a decent atmosphere. It's a bit tricky to find (we walked past it initially), but the service is good, and food is delicious. We were a a group of 6 and got big combination plates of food (great for tasting variety) and they even through tea in for free."}
{"text":"Went at lunch, ended up being there for 2 hours. Food was cold. Also ordered an extra platter to go during the meal, when I got back to the office and looked at it they only gave me half of what I'd ordered.   My initial payment didn't go through, they didn't notice. Felt compelled to call in my credit card number as a good samaritan. They called back later in the day and demanded I go in in person to repay. I then later noticed they had actually charged my card when I called in. They were ready to charge me twice.  Black listed."}
{"text":"With everyone kept telling me how awesome Ethiopian food is, I am ready to give it a try. My Hot yoga Date who is an Ethiopian food fanatic was nice enough to take me under her wings and took me for this \"exotic\" food experience.   We ended up at Ethiopiques, not because it is a good restaurant for a first timer because we have a voucher! Since it was a Tuesday evening, we did not call in for reservations and the waitress just rolled her eyes and tell us next time we need to call first..and she will let us go this time.. Will there be a next time?   Services was really really really slow..... we waited to have our order taken, waited for drink, waited for food.. waited for the bill...   Vegetarian Platter for both of us.. Yes I think I am slowly converted to a vegetarian one meal at a time. I found the selection interesting and each of those puddles of mashed food tasted quite unique.... but it was just too dark in the restaurant. Those rolled napkins looking spongy tasting sour dough flat bread for sure is not going to be my carb of choice, as I don't really enjoy it's texture!   Ethiopian Coffee ritual though was fun! My date was laughing her heads off when I looked so freaked out with the waitress trying to hit me with the hot roasting coffee pan. I really enjoy the coffee, nice, strong and aromatic, a great finish for our dinner while I stuffed my face with popcorn!  BTW, I found out I really like to eat with my hands... and making eating Ethiopian food a really primitive sensual experience!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the meat platter for 2, which was $15/person before taxes (if I remember correctly). The restaurant was cozy and comfy. The food was yummy, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely come back, and with more friends!"}
{"text":"We had the meat platter and the vegetable platter as well. I much prefer the meat platter over the vegetable platter. The vegetable platter was quite bland whereas the meat platter was just delicious. We also ordered house salad, which turned out a bit too salty.  Overall, it's a unique dining experience and I recommend and going at least once. Do try the meat platter!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was amazing. The server explained to us what each meal was and assisted us in ordering. Portions was large take their advice when ordering, we almost over order. Overall amazing place will come back! Food was great very flavourful."}
{"text":"Small and simple Ethiopian spot with an authentic feel. Super friendly owner took care of the table and shared a little history plus childhood stories of his own family dinners and coffee hours.  The menu is small with mostly vegetarian or chicken/lamb stews. For a group, the platter is a good bet to sample most of their food including the lentil/chickpea stews, kale and lamb tibs. It all comes with a bowl of injera rolled flat bread to dive into the plate with. No forks provided.  Their post-meal coffee ceremony is very aromatic. The coffee takes about a half hour to roast, but comes out fresh and light, also served with popped corn to snack on."}
{"text":"A few of my friends have never had Ethiopian so I was like the connoisseur (oh brother!! I've only had it once, guys!!)  Likes  - food sharing (whatever you order, they put it on a large platter for everyone to share) - lamb short ribs (nicely grilled on a stone plate, similar to Chinese short ribs except it's lamb!!) - spices (it gives a zing to the meat, adding uniqueness to Ethiopian cuisine) - injera (this sponge-like flat bread really fills you up; especially tasty when used to wrap meat/veggies) - Tusker pale lager (I'm not a beer person but it was smooth) - the aroma of roasted Ethiopian coffee beans.... hmmm  Dislikes - little on the greasy side - no napkins/utensils unless requested (just a head's up) - forgetful staff =P (a couple of items were missing so we had to remind them) - slow service, indeed... thankfully it's Friday and we made good use of the time to hang out and catch up"}
{"text":"I have the veggy and meat platter every time I'm here.  I love this place.  Food's great and the people are lovely and care very much about their food and heritage"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and the service. Ordered a mixed platter and had leftovers enough for another 2 meals after. Really have nothing bad to say about it :) If you sign up for their email list, they'll send you a $10 off coupon so it's a nice bonus."}
