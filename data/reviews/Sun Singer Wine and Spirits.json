{"text":"What a nice surprise!

We went last night because it was warm and we wanted to sit outside and have a drink and some dinner. 

I got the 1/2 Bavarian Pretzel sandwich with ham and swiss with chicken enchilada soup and my husband got the Smoked Salmon Club (he called it a salmon BLT) with a side of beets. I was really happy with my choice. He REALLY liked his, too. 

We browsed in the store and they have such a wide selection! Their deli cheeses look amazing. The choices of beer is practically endless and they have some FINE liquors. I had a lot of fun browsing. 

The only downside to Sun Singer is that it is a bit pricey, but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"After putting down $60 ahead of time for reservation for 6 people, we arrived on time, were seated and put in our food order. An hour later, we had received one app, had our water refilled once, and fielded a mistaken drink order. 

When we finally received our food, it was just alright--definitely not worth the wait. We had to ask the server twice to get one dish that hadn't been delivered. 

To add insult to injury, they apparently had a preset gratuity for a party of 6 or more, which is normally fine, whatever--but this was handwritten by my server instead, and then she also hovered over me the entire time (the most attention we got throughout our visit). 

If it were about 10-15% cheaper, and we had a wait of half the time I think it would have been a fantastic experience, unfortunately, that did not happen."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to all of the restaurants on campus. The menu here is diverse and is great for a light meal full of flavor. Their lobster bisque is great and their deli sandwiches are very fresh as they have a deli inside. I haven't had any of their wine selection, but their selection appears to be their pride as it takes up much of the store area."}
{"text":"This is a cool place for lunch and sipping wine outside in the non-winter months.  I wish they'd move to downtown Champaign, the location sucks!  Oh and they have a great selection of wines in the store too."}
{"text":"Quite nice little wine store and cafe in a strip mall.  Nice selection of wines by the glass, extensive selection of beers (sweetie prefers to wine). We shared a cheese and antipasti plate, which was tasty, and sat for a pleasant hour on the patio. Very friendly, attentive service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food (that grilled cheese with apples....awesome). And very savvy kitchen crew - they notice if you say no nuts in one dish, and make sure any other dish with nuts in your order is okay.  Great service...."}
{"text":"I would say this is an okay liquor store. They seem to have a variety of wines & beer on hand. However, they lack a decent variety of hard liquor. Also, I find them to be quite expensive. I prefer Binnys."}
{"text":"The selection of food here is great! Being a vegetarian, I always worry that I won't be able to find anything I can eat that I would like. I ordered the Black Bean Burger that came with a side of fries. The portions were huge and I was barely able to finish the entire meal! Their menu is half food, half wine. The wine selection is great too, as you would imagine. I'm a big fan of sweet red wines and was pleased to see that they had one of those on the menu too! Would definitely recommend this place as a break from Green st. and campus food!"}
{"text":"Sun Singer is a refreshing addition to the Champaign restaurant scene.  The location is great with easy parking.  The food is of very high quality- I am partial to their Greek salad and to their succulent black bean burger, which is the best I've ever tasted.  I would advise you to order more, rather than less,(i.e. get both soup and a salad, or salad and a sandwich) or you may go away hungry-the emphasis here is on quality rather than quantity.  They have some very lovely desserts and appetizers, too.  Service is usually attentive and courteous.  The only thing I don't like is that the tables are kind of small and close together.  I wouldn't be surprised if they end up moving to a larger location, because the place is always full of people and Sun Singer's vast wine collection takes up a lot of room, too.  (We've never had to wait for a table, though.)  What I like best about Sun Singer is that it is sophisticated without being in the least pretentious.  The owner is always friendly and ready to assist with questions.  I wish this restaurant continued success!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but as of mid January 2016 it's no longer good for gluten free eaters. They have changed their menu and no longer have a gluten free menu. 

As of this writing they also don't have kids options any longer. We came in all the time before, but the new menu is a bummer and I hope they fix it. 

Two stars because after being seated we realized there was nothing for us to eat and we had to get up and leave. We were informed that the sandwich bread was now only \"reduced gluten\", although the manager said that was wrong, but we were already on our way out."}
{"text":"This is the deli that isn't.

The food and wine are good, as described by other reviewers but the take-out food ordering system is among the most bizarre I've ever experienced. 

Apparently the restaurant and retail foods systems run on different computer systems, so to order prepared food to take out....you have to order in the restaurant or at the front counter, then go back to get your food and the \"deli\" staff (who speak poor English) have no idea about your order until it surfaces on their paper printout.  I've been in restaurants, takeouts and delis everywhere and have never seen such poor coordination, even when orders are simply shouted.

In a city that is overrun with restaurants and takeout places, you'd think that the owners could somehow get past this and create a real working deli - something the immediate area needs badly (the other sandwich shop in the mall is pretty poor).  The lunch rush could be huge for the place, but apparently they're not interested in more business in a brutally competitive restaurant market and depend on the \"certain age\" wine by the glass market in the evenings.

My two stars worth."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite place for a casual dinner and drinks in Champaign.

It's laid back and casual (but still cool!).  It's a wine bar, so of course I love it.  But they also have really good sandwiches, cheese platters, and appetizers.

Relatively inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"Wow.

Sunsinger was a very pleasant surprise.  I wasn't expecting much from a sandwich cafe in a wine store, but the food here was absolutely fabulous.  The cheese experience was wonderfully presented and a great way to start off the evening.  We had the two cheese plate and it was a perfect appetizer; four and it would've been a lovely meal.

My husband raved about the beef and mushroom sandwich he ordered, and I couldn't have been happier with my gourmet grilled cheese.  I adore sweet/savoy dishes, and the rich buttery challa, creamy melted cheeses, sweet fig jam and tangy apple slices were really a winning combination.

We ordered the chocolate love cake for dessert, and it was a bit much for us.  The cake was so rich that even splitting it, we were definitely pushing the envelope to finish it off.  It was, however, delicious and a very small piece would have been perfect.

The service was friendly and attentive and the cafe area had a very nice cozy feeling.  We wandered around the store checking out the wine selection and cheese counter after our meal.  Had I not just consumed enough cheese to sink a ship, I would have done some serious damage to my grocery budget!  Dinner itself wasn't cheap considering it was sandwiches, but it was clear that the ingredients were top quality and well worth the price."}
{"text":"I want to give you 4 stars, sun singer... But the service is painfully slow, especially with so many waiters standing around idly (why are you texting at work?). Fix that and I'll give the 4th star back. Nonetheless, my greek salad today was wonderful. The greens were perfect, the onions were sliced ever-so-thinly and the dressing was atypical in a good way for a greek salad (kind of pesto reminiscent.) They could have done a little better at designing the place into a dual-purpose venue. It looks too much like we're eating in a grocery store."}
{"text":"Nice people, excellent food. Rating? You decide. We went for lunch with a guest. After waiting an hour and a quarter for our food, I found a waitress and informed her, without making a fuss, of our predicament. (Meanwhile my spouse had ordered a second beer just because we had sat for so long.) The waiter came with the food, which was excellent, and offered up an excuse of a \"lost ticket\" or some such thing. When he returned with the check, I remarked that we though it should be complimentary. The manager/owner appeared and offered to comp either the food or the beverages, indicating (after a pause) that the food would be the better value. Since we had a guest and had ended up pressed for time with upcoming appointments, I decided not to argue, and accepted the partial comp offer. When the owner/manager left, our guest noted \"Well, that was kind of chintzy.\" I'd say after an hour and twenty minutes of waiting for a simple order of a salad and two sandwiches, she had a point. We'll probably go back, but will be far less patient the next time. 1-star rating is for the experience; the food was excellent as we've come to expect."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed until very recently, and now I can't wait to come back to try all their different wines and menu items.

True, the location leaves something to be desired, but I think it's worth the trip.  Here, they have a wide variety of wines (so much so, that even my wine-savvy friend hadn't heard of several of their selections), and a surprisingly extensive menu for a deli-esque kitchen.

We split a cheese plate and a hummus plate.  The cheese plate was okay... the cheeses weren't overly exotic or special, but the black-bean hummus they had was really really good.  The taste of it lingered in my mouth for quite some time afterwards.

Our total bill came out to around $60, but that also included.... let's seee...... 6 glasses of wine?

Not somewhere I would come everyday, but a nice treat every once in awhile.  They have outdoor seating as well.

The other half of Sunsinger was basically a cellar where they carried a wide variety of wines, liquors, etc.  For the most part, I think these wines were priced a little higher than one would typically find elsewhere, but I'm not wine connoisseur, so don't quote me on that.

If you have the opportunity, give Sunsinger a try."}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for an alternative to all the chain restaurants in town (my mom was visiting and hates eating somewhere she can go to in Chicago).  This is a unique-to-Champaign place for sure, so it seemed promising.  

In concept, the place is great.  Cute little cafe/ wine bar in conjunction with a wine and cheese and specialty food shop.  They need to do a better job in the cafe area, in my opinion.  The menu was interesting, but the prices were a little high.   When our food arrived, we noticed right away how small the portion sizes were.  I actually appreciate when restaurants have reasonable portion sizes, but these were on the small side of reasonable.  Neither of us felt full at the end of the meal, and for the price of the meal, we felt a little ripped off.   The food was good, we had the chicken salad sandwich and the gourmet grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and wine expertise.  Casual dining either inside or outside with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic to place to relax and sip on wine. Definitely a must if in the area. I like their selection of wine and cheese. The service here is consistently good and the food is on par. This is a hidden gem in the area."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited the Sun Singer today for a late lunch. We have been a handful of times in the past, too.

The Sun Singer now has craft beer on tap! Pair this with their recent expansion (huge new dining space) and there is a lot of excitement in the air.

I ordered a half salad and soup. Their soup of the day tends to be pretty tasty. Today they had a sausage and kale soup that was delicious. I paired the soup with the almond encrusted goat cheese salad --- strong flavors between the goat cheese and balsamic dressing. Yum!

The Sun Singer also has a large retail area of craft beers, wines, cheeses, and gift items. I was able to purchase BCBS here earlier this month with no problem.

I deducted one star for slow service but I honestly didn't mind spending more time in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I use this place often to meet friends or associates for lunch. Quality ingredients and consistent service make it very appealing. It is relatively small in the summer with tables harder to find in the winter or during inclement weather when the patio is closed. Parking can be equally challenging. But I've never had a bad meal or service here and the pricing is expected for the caliber of food/services provided."}
{"text":"I have had very good food and service here in the past, but this evening  was so bad I don't ever plan on going back. All of our food came out only very slightly warm...it felt as if it came out of the oven 20 minutes before being served. Steaks, oysters Rockefeller, everything. Send steak back, they brought another cold one assuring me it just came off the grill. I made the waiter touch it, and he agreed with my assessment. Nice way to celebrate an anniversary. Will not be coming back. The cheapest steakhouse chain in town can even get the steak cooked to proper temp and send it out hot."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's bridal shower at Sun Singer Wine and Spirits yesterday.  Rick was wonderful to work with beforehand and during the shower.  The staff was so friendly and accommodating, the room was perfect, and we couldn't be happier with the whole day.  Kristin was superb!!  She was helpful at every turn, and did a fantastic job.  And of course the food was fantastic, one of the reasons we chose to have the shower there!"}
{"text":"Nice choice in SW Champaign.  Part wine store, part deli, part cafe, kind of tries to be all things.  That's where I ding it a star.  The food has always been good, and they have lots of choices of salads, sandwiches, and even dessert - maybe too many.  I like going to the deli and having them create me a plate of cheeses and meats to sample.  The ambiance is pleasant and somewhat upscale.  This is in an affluent residential part of town, and the clientele mostly reflects that.  I think the mark-up on their retail wines is high - I would go to Corkscrew or Friar Tuck instead.  Nice place to unwind though, with outdoor seating too, and I never felt pushed to leave."}
{"text":"Dinner out in Champaign doesn't get much better than Sunsinger. The wine selection is extensive, and the service generally top rate. (I've had one very very poor experience with their brunch, but I won't divulge into that... I just recommend to avoid their brunch).

App: Cheese/meat plate
Wine: Malbec
Dinner: We both did the filet rare and it was cooked perfectly. The wine was a little pricier than I would have liked, but it was delicious. Enough that we did a second bottle.

If you're stopping in for lunch, their salads and the jerk chicken wrap are awesome. (It does get very busy during the weekday lunches) Also, if you need a wine gift basket, this is your place."}
{"text":"I could write a long review, but it's not necessary. This place is simply the best."}
{"text":"This review is late in coming.  I went to Sun Singer not long after it opened.  I ordered a platter of food that was supposed to feed four.  There was barely enough to feed two.  Then I ordered a bottle of wine off their menu.  OFF THEIR MENU!!  I did not bring my own and did not buy a special bottle off their shelf, but bought one off their menu and was charged a corkage fee.  WHAT?!?!  I \"discussed\" this with the manager and was told this was the policy.  He was dismissive and arrogant about it, talking as if I knew nothing about the concept of a corkage fee.  That was the first, last, and only time I ever set foot in that place."}
{"text":"A favorite luncheon stop. 

Just had the Burger off the new menu, (second time). Excellent; moist, hearty, great flavor, perfectly cooked medium rare. Match-Stick fries also perfectly cooked--light and crunchy. #GotItRight   #BurgerAndFries."}
{"text":"Wow!!  There are a lot of good reviews for this place.  Maybe I am missing something.  Went here for lunch today and ordered the special which was a caprese sandwich & broccoli cheese soup.  They both tasted just fine.  In fact I thought the sandwich was quite tasty.  But I left hungry.  That was the smallest sandwich I think I have ever had.  It was about the size of one of those little finger sandwiches you get served on a platter by someone walking by at a party.  2 or 3 bites and it's over.

The soup was good but again very small portion.  The real kicker was the bill.  $11.00 for a couple of bites.  

Friar Tuck has  a better wine selection too.

Not sure if I would go back for a second try."}
{"text":"Sun Singer is definitely a rare find in the area, especially when you're tired of the campus restaurants on Green St.  I came here for to celebrate my friend's graduation and this place was divine.  The layout is not exactly fitting for large groups and our party had to push several tables together, but the staff was very accommodating and the ambiance is great for conversation.

The restaurant/cafe is inside a winery and is perfect for a casual lunch.  They have a deli section with fine cheese and meats.  I felt like I was transported to Europe and wish I could take a 3 hour lunch-break just to enjoy it all.... 

The first thing people told me to get was the LOBSTER BISQUE.  And believe me, this is the best!  It was so creamy, thick, and full of lobster flavor and goes well with any of their sandwiches.  I got their grilled cheese supreme with 2 amazing cheeses (Danish Fontina & Fiscalini Cheddar), granny smith apples and fig jam on challah bread.  You'd never think jam would ever go so well in a cheese sandwich, but it does!  A half sandwich and cup of soup is $9.75.

Their sandwiches some with some olives, fried vegetable crisps and mini pickles.  I have yet to try the rest of their extensive menu but their food is well worth the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch with my niece and it was so good. Our service was great and we loved the sandwich. Such a cute place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere. The blackened chicken sandwich and baked potato salad was ridiculously good.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I would eat here every day if I could afford it.  I generally get the same thing which is the Jamaican jerk wrap but all the other stuff sounds so fab. I have done some bite trades and tried out the salads and  the Cuban sandwhich. The deli is top notch. The caprese and apple salad are some of my faves.   Solid beer selection at bar but if you don't find what you want there they have a whole liquor store with even more great selections! I will go broke for sun singer"}
{"text":"Disappointed with our (1st) experience tonight. Came in to have a few drinks and maybe dinner. Wanted to sit at the bar, got the last two seats. The young man behind the bar was busy talking to a young woman, when finished he didn't welcome us, threw two menus down and walked away. He seemed very uninterested in waiting on us. I noticed everyone around us had nice full glasses of wine, ours were tiny. We got the hint, we left and don't plan on returning. I guess we didn't look like the regulars but were ready to spend a nice night and plenty of money."}
{"text":"Great wine and food a must stop. Always look forward to good bowl of chili on a cool night. When its warm out we love sitting  outside with one of their featured wines. The place is a gold mine in a quiet part of town."}
{"text":"They have an excellent selection of wine and the food is good although it is all very expensive. When they first opened, you could buy 5 flights of wine for a fixed price. I wish they would bring that back. it was fun. They ruined their hummus when they started adding black beans to it. It is more like bean dip than hummus. I would give this place another star if it weren't for the very rude young man who does the wine tastings."}
{"text":"Sun Singer has the best wine selection when you don't want to buy at a warehouse and you want expert recommendations. I can go there when I'm about to entertain my \"wine friends\" and get great wine that won't break the bank or I can ask for two buck chuck that won't embarrass me for my \"I know nothing about wine\" friends. The staff is really friendly and it's a good place to sit outside in jeans and a t-shirt without dealing with a downtown scene."}
{"text":"Sun Singer was able to squeeze me and my family in on Graduation & Mother's Day Sunday and for that I am super grateful! But the great experience doesn't end there. This is a beautiful restaurant/deli/shop/wine bar. The atmosphere is lovely and inviting, super clean, and fancy without the fancy prices. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the wine we ordered was super tasty too. The waitress was super friendly and smiley and welcoming, we really appreciated her. This is a great place that I hope to come back to someday when I'm visiting Champaign!! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Really nice place. A real hidden gem. We decided to go out for some wine last night, and chose this place because it was so close to our home. We were pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is great and the staff are very knowledgable and nice. I didn't eat, but plan on going back for the food!"}
{"text":"Expensive place for a so so food

Ambience 4/5
Food 3/5
Service 3/5
Worth for money 3/5"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good the price is what you would expect for a college town. Do not go with the wine 14 bucks to open it. Lots of wine to select but carry it out. The fried food was overcooked burnt is not good. The atmosphere is pretty good but crowded. The services are pretty great the French wine guy is a treat to talk with. Very knowledgable"}
{"text":"This place has a large selection of foreign wines and beer.  Not only that, but they have \"high-end\" sodas as well as a great deli/cheese counter!  If you're looking for that special food item, give them a try."}
{"text":"Sun Singer just warms my heart.

Some people seem to balk at the idea of a fantastic eatery existing inside a wine shop, but it's really ideal--you should have no qualms about having wine with your early lunch, trying a few glasses, and walking out with your favorite bottle!  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is fantastic.  It's the perfect place to grab a classy lunch."}
{"text":"Really great food, and a nice (though pricey) alcohol selection.  

The encrusted goat cheese salad is delicious, and the mushroom soup on Tuesdays is TDF.  Diet blasphemy, but TDF."}
{"text":"Great pumpkin dessert!"}
{"text":"Our first time dining at Sunsinger last weekend was fabuous!  Excellent Chielan sea Bass and Grilled Scallops.  Couldn't be happier with the service or the quality and artful preparation of the food."}
{"text":"Everything is good about this place!  I regularly get carry out and it has never been incorrect and it's always done in 15 minutes or less.  Red Sangria in the summer is my favorite, but if you have 2 be warned that you will feel it!  My favorite items are the Chipotle Chicken Wrap, Black Bean Burger or whatever the daily special is.  Great chili as well.  Laurent knows his wine if you need help picking out a bottle."}
{"text":"Since I'm 14 days too young to drink, I can't comment on the wine, but the sandwiches here are wonderful. This seems to be the place for the countryclub set to lunch, so they are expensive, but if you are going to pay for a gourmet sandwich, this place is 1000 times better than the competition. The Grilled Cheese Supreme on crisp buttery challah bread is sublime and the Roasted Turkey & Bacon is accented by rosemary aioli and crisp greens. Top notch ingredients!"}
{"text":"Went here looking for some food to warm up with after spending a chilly afternoon outside - was not disappointed!! My sister and I split the black bean burger sandwich and the lemon twist sandwich. Both were amazingly delicious! The lemon twist was different from anything I've had before; the goat cheese, spinach and beets were a surprisingly perfect combo!
their beer and wine selection is also fantastic - the man who was providing samples was very knowledgeable and explained each wine and beer we tasted thoroughly.
I would most definitely recommend this place for their food, and drink selection!"}
{"text":"Sunsinger is definitely one of the treats of the CU area. It has a great atmosphere, delicious food and, overall, a friendly staff. I've been there many times since a friend turned me onto it and the food has always been delicious. The almond-crusted goat cheese salad is one of my favorite menu items. It has one of the best balsamic dressings I've ever tasted and the combination of almonds, warm goat cheese, dressing and the crunchy salad is perfect. Also try the grilled cheese with apple slices and fig jam inside. You'll be glad you did.

I've had a few cheese plates and their selection of cheese spreads and have been impressed every time. When they have special selections of cheeses they are always well-selected and make for a fun lunch or dinner as they usually range from the more mild to the more adventurously pungent.

If I have one complaint, it's that the service is slow. There is a very relaxed atmosphere in general there and as long as you leave yourself plenty of time you'll have an enjoyable time. I would not recommend going there if you're in a hurry though. They're staff seems fairly small no matter how busy they are and everything comes to your table at a leisurely pace. If you have an hour for lunch or are not on your way to a movie after dinner though, you should be fine.

After you're done, be sure to check out the wine selection. The staff is incredibly helpful in selecting a good wine and will not judge you if you don't know a great deal about wines in general. I've went with a staff member's recommendation on a couple occasions and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot to go without the kids. The cater to a more mature crowd, which I enjoy. The food is amazing. The prices seem a little high, but the quality is also much higher than you would expect to get from a chain. Their pretzel bread is to die for!  They have wine tastings every Saturday that are fun and informative. The owner is very friendly and personally greets us every time we stop in."}
{"text":"Normally a good place to go, however when I wait at a table for over five minutes and there are four waiters wondering around and not acknowledging me, I walk out. Shameful service"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when my friends brought me to this cute little place.  Who'd have thought this cool, tiny wine bar and store would exist in a strip mall in Champaign, IL?

Healthy pours from the bartender.  And the menu, while limited, is perfect for nibbling, chatting and wine sipping.  We split a couple of appetizers, with the cheese platter filled with our wonderfully stinky choices, the star.

Nice selection of wines to purchase also."}
{"text":"Despite the drab, suburban area that Sunsinger is located in, it really is a great deli, bar, restaurant, and liquor store combined. There are some great cheeses, meats, sauces, and so forth to be selected in the deli area. The bar has a great wine selection, including two delicious \"wine slushy\" options (at approximately $6, they are a little pricey for my taste, but worth it on a beautiful summer day). The restaurant has some delicious sandwich options and good salads and spread/sampler plates! At one point, Sunsinger carried Berliner Weiss, which is what hooked me initially. Although I have not seen it in awhile, they do sell getränkesirup (a sweet syrup, which as an import comes in raspberry flavor only) along with beers that are comparable to get a similar effect. One downside (which is probably not a problem for most readers) is the selection of kosher wines. While they do offer a small selection of Yarden, there are tons of other kosher wines out there that are way better. Aside from this flaw, I love, love, love Sunsinger and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"I have changed my tune because Sun Singer has REALLY stepped it up.  They listened to the feedback from customers after some of the initial menu changes, and things are fantastic now!

In addition to reinstating the previous quality levels of my favorite Grilled Cheese Supreme, Sun Singer has put some other fantastic options on the menu--most notably, the singularly best burger I have ever had in my life.  It is called the Sun Burger and it has bacon jam and gruyere cheese and REAL heirloom tomatoes that taste like they just came out of your grandma's garden.  Yay!  With all the burger places in this town, I certainly never expected to find the perfect moist, juicy burger at a wine joint!  They also have a dinner menu now with lovely steaks and pork and salmon and chicken and pasta--you can usually get at least some of these available during the day on the weekends.  They also have sandwich specials--I had the meatloaf sandwich special on a weekend day with a friend and loved it!  And the croque madame?  It's making me hungry to think about all that gooey cheese!

The best part is the wonderful service.  The entire team is friendly and great and they ALWAYS remember you!  You will never have an empty glass of iced tea or finished plated dirtying your table--they take service seriously.  I credit my favorite server, Eric, for setting the tone.  He is always sincerely happy to see you and can immediately make your day better just by taking such good care of you.

While I still miss the sprinkle of Terra chips and the olives on my plate as a garnish, I'm happy to give them up to the wonderful enhancements at my favorite place to read and eat lunch!"}
{"text":"The Service was really good. Our meal last night could have been warmer, but it was homecoming.  The food is good, but for the price, it could be better."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and the service was excellent.  We were in a beautiful dining room with soft jazz music in the background. We shared a bottle of wine, and my husband and I split two appetizers: Caprese salad and a blue crab cake with a corn aioli.  Both were very good.  The tomatoes in the Caprese salad tasted - little like store-bought and were a little firm.  Surprising for August in Illinois.  I was expecting some home raised beef eaters. Otherwise, the appetizers were perfect. 
I ordered the root beer glazed pork chop with bourbon mashed sweet potatoes and corn on the cob. The sweet potatoes and corn on the cob were amazing.  The corn was definitely fresh sweet corn.  Honestly, I should have ordered my pork chop well done, instead of medium well. I'm not a big meat eater, and a shadow of pink meat can do me in.  The pork chop was beautiful and very tasty, pink not withstanding.  My husband had the special, which was Dab Sole - a grilled fish with a lemon caper sauce and Italian bread crumbs - that came with purple cauliflower and a cous cous and saffron rice blend.  He said it was very tasty and would gladly order it again.  
And now, for dessert. The mister had blueberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream. He inhaled it. 'Nuff said there. I had the Espresso cheese cake with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and chocolate coffee beans. Every bite was exquisite. I am madly in love with that cheesecake!  
If I could give Sun Singer 4.75 stars, I would.  But, because the tomatoes are an integral part of Caprese salad, I just can't go the five star full monty. Fabulous restaurant, in a wine store!  PS I stopped at the deli on the way out and bought some parmesan artichoke dip and pita chips for my midnight snack. I will keep you posted."}
{"text":"Wonderful homey, local place with a wide variety of items on the menu. I am not usually one who likes fruit on a savory dish, but even I like the grilled cheese with apple and fig jam on it. 

The expansion has made it easier to pop in, especially with larger parties. When my parents have visited, they have very much enjoyed going here for a nice dinner. It's also a perk to support local, which I try to do. 

My only gripe, and it's not something that the owners can really fix, is the parking situation. It's almost impossible to find a spot during a busy lunch hour, even if you're not going here. Employees park in the back and the bank has strict parking next door; I've had to leave because there were no spots to be found."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place.  The wait staff (as well as wine clerks) are knowledgable and friendly.  I was visiting the cafe this time and was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices.  I ordered a \"sunsinger cheese experience\" for $7.99 (or maybe it was $6.99, I can't remember) which included 2 wonderful chunks of cheese (and a little knife to slice them), delicious fresh sliced bread, lots of fresh fruit including grapes, apples, dried cranberries and sugared, dried mango all beautifully presented on a big plate.   It was so lovely.  And I ordered a nice glass of wine for $5.50.  It was great and the waitress was \"johnny on the spot\" refilling my friends' water glasses and getting their orders.  A great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled cheese supreme! The apples and fig butter make it a real treat. I suggest sharing it though as it is a big sandwich. I also love their almond crusted goat cheese salad. Great decor and love how the restaurant is a part of the cheese and wine shop."}
{"text":"Sun Singer is a nice little wine bar randomly located on a small strip with tons of drinks, cheese, and light dishes to choose from. 

The meat and cheese options were its best quality, as they have chef inspired additions like jam, dried fruit, fresh fruit, vegetables, and legumes, and they come with delicious slices of fresh baked bread. The prices do add up if you try a few different cured meats and aged cheese, so order carefully. They do have a deli up front with many other selections. I especially liked the prosciutto (a meat that I don't normally enjoy), however theirs was rich and full of flavor. 

I wasn't as impressed with their other dishes, such as the beef chili and Caesar salad. The calamari were what you'd expect from anywhere. They do have some original cocktails though and I really enjoyed my tequila-based old fashion. 

The vibe is pretty great for a date - intimate but charming. I was quite happy overall and will be going back."}
{"text":"Great service, advice, genuine expert interested help, everything the box stores are not and decent prices."}
{"text":"A great little find, tucked away in a strip mall. The food is always fresh and delicious. Seating can be scarce, and service is sometimes slow and inattentive. If you're not in a rush - it's a nice place to just relax, enjoy some conversation and try something new."}
{"text":"It was busy on Friday night, but I was still disappointed that the food was cold and my friend's salad came out with no dressing. A waiter went and got some dressing when she asked, but overall the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch with my friends.  Always busy, so get there early. A nice place to start with a glass of wine then have soup and sandwich or soup and salad."}
{"text":"I come here mostly for craft beers. In that regard their selection is smallish and random. But that makes coming here kind of an adventure just to see what they have. If it were just for the beer selection I'd give them three stars. But they do have what appears to be a fairly expansive wine selection, and their staff seems knowledgeable about wines and booze. They also have a nice deli and cafe and it's all such a lovely little place to grab a gourmet sandwich to nibble on after you've picked up a couple bottles of trendy syrah, which they'll gladly open for you to serve on-premises with your meal. Same goes for any beer they carry, and they have a quick-chill cold-water tank that will chill your beer or white wine in a matter of minutes, ready to serve long before your meal arrives.

After they abandoned Monticello for greener pastures, I resisted the urge to patronize their new location for years. But I've come to appreciate that they just couldn't do what they've done in Champaign if they were still out in sleepy little Monticello. Still, I wish they would have kept their Monticello store as an outpost of civilization while still doing their thing in Champaign. That would make Sun Singer doubly cool."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  I love this place and I don't even drink wine!  I concur, order the gourmet grilled cheese!  For standard lunch fare (Sandwiches, soups and salads), the prices are a little high.  My husband's half Hot Dutch was TINY, dwarfed by his half Caesar salad.  My half gourmet grilled cheese was a little on the small side but nearly as small and my cup of dill cucumber soup was just enough-and so refreshing!  Our started of pretzel sticks seemed like they were frozen and reheated in the oven, not exactly homemade, but the dip that came with them was tasty.   Service was very good, attentive servers and friendly manager.

 I also love their deli counter, they make a mean cheese spread!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Driving through from Denver, we stopped by for lunch. Our waiter, Eric, gave us outstanding service. We ordered the almond crusted goat cheese salad, grilled cheese supreme, ricotta cheesecake with raspberry sauce, and cappuccino. Everything was beyond delicious and we are not the easiest to wow, but WOW!! Holy yumminess! Definitely a place to return to."}
{"text":"Everything was Delicious!

I never write reviews, but this place is worth writing about. This was our first time going there, and it definitely won't be our last. We both ordered the half Soup & Sandwich. My fiance got the Club Paradiso and Corn&Potato Shrimp Chowder. I got the BBQ Pulled Pork and the same soup. Now the BBQ Pulled Pork was AMAZING!!! I couldn't not get enough of it, so I ended up ordering another half of a sandwich. :)) 

Also, the service was wonderful, despite a few mistakes. The man that was making our food behind the cheese display was so kind and attentive to everything we needed."}
{"text":"Ordered their \"specialty\" cheese burger and fries. Requested the burger be well done. When it came to the table, there was still a lot of pink in the burger. Really pink toward the middle. Since we were on a tight work lunch schedule, I didn't send it back. This is my mistake. 

An hour later, violently sick. I don't know if it was the undercooked meat, the grease, or the bacon fat butter in the burger, but I won't be able to eat there again for a while. Maybe I'll just stick to their wine and cheese."}
{"text":"Great place for wine and cheese! Friendly people, delicious assortment of cheeses, deli food and wines. The atmosphere is very casual as it is set in the center of a strip mall.  This is a mix of wine/beer store and deli.  There are several tables and a bar inside as well as tables out front on the patio.  The menu is very extensive with a variety of wines, beers and spirits to choose from as well as soups, salads and sandwiches.  The food was very good, presented well and reasonably priced. In the store area you will find a nice variety of wines and beers to take home with you."}
{"text":"Very great restaurant choice for a nice dinner or date. The menu is pretty diverse in terms of the sandwiches and dishes that you can get. The ambiance in the restaurant was super cute, definitely hit it off with all of the winery themed decor. We got cheese curds as an appetizer and they were great! For my entree, I got the Italian beef and it was by far one of the best I've ever had! The meat was super tender and the au jus was done very well! Overall I think everyone in our party enjoyed their food and would probably come back again for an occasion or a nice meal!"}
{"text":"I had heard that this place serves gourmet food.  Unfortunately, it is in no ways trendy.  It just seems like a cute place to have brunch.. and the crowd is a bit older.  It's not really expensive.. but it's a little pricey for sandwiches.  It's a little ways of a drive from campus or downtown.. but the food is good.  Service is a little lacking.  You have to flag down the waiter for menus, more water, etc.

I tried their lobster bisque and thought it was pretty good.  I also liked the smoked salmon-goat cheese sandwich.  I tried my friend's reuben and thought it was AWESOME.

It also seemed to have a good selection of international wines and other products (sodas, etc.).  I personally think that Friar Tuck's is better though for buying alcohol."}
{"text":"Great spot for a glass of wine and some cheese to nosh on. Staff is knowledgable about the wines, and can recommend interesting bottles for you to take home or drink there."}
{"text":"Really great place for simple and casual food not far from campus. The menu has an excellent sandwich selection and some hearty sounding entrees as well. So far, I've tried the sun burger with sweet potato fries and the special fruit cobbler which was peach. The burger was slightly over cooked and I couldn't really taste some of the toppings described in the menu like the bacon jam but it was still a large and tasty burger. The sweet potato fries were waffled and I enjoyed them a lot. On another occasion, I came just for dessert and loved the peach cobbler a la mode. It was a huge portion and was very delicious. Overall, I definitely see myself coming back here and can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"As you walk in, all the wine and spirits are displayed in front of you. As you turn to the left you will see a nice little bar with some tables and the deli behind that. The beer selection is towards the back of the wine.  The bar/cafe area is really nice and welcoming.  They have a good selection of all things.  Extensive wine selection and a very good rotating beer selection.  Good micro options like Bells, or some imports as well.  You can sample wine, or pick a beer and they will chill that so you can enjoy for your meal.  

The food is really good.  Lots of sandwiches, soups, salads, meat and cheese plates, as well as a few small plates.  A good Reuben, Roast Beef, and any other sandwich that happens to be available.  Sauteed mushrooms as a side is great.  You can also get beer, wine, and any other deli options to go.  I really like the place."}
{"text":"Very cool lunch place. I had the half sandwich and salad combo. I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and the goat cheese salad and they were very good. There were also cheese plate options that I would love to go back and try. This is also a good spot for gifts for wine lovers/people that entertain. There was outside seating and seating at the bar. My only gripe was that the service was a tad bit slow but it may have been because I was sitting at the bar. I can see how people may say the food is pricey but it is worth it for the better quality. The portobello sandwich was a good vegetarian option, and the grilled cheese sandwich also looks like a great option, I want to go back and try that also!"}
{"text":"Sun Singer is a true gem! We brought our dog to the oncology department at U of I. Since they had to do a myriad of tests that required us killing a few hours, we were on the hunt for a place we could relax and make the most of our day. The vet clinic gave us a map of the area with recommended spots and after reading it was a 'wine bar' our choice was settled.

The parking lot was pretty packed for lunch time, but we were lucky enough to snag the last table. The tables are pretty close together, but I still liked the ambiance and didn't feel claustrophobic. They had a nice wine list, but I opted for a french toast martini--or should I say two of them. They were fabulous! 

We also ordered the Antipasti & Cheese plate with two cheeses, Smoked Gouda and Valdeon. It came with a few olives, salami, artichokes bread and cheese. It was perfect for two to split. I ordered the portobello sandwich and can't recommend it enough. It came with those Terra chips that I'm now hooked on. I like that their menu has a good mix of something for everyone.

Our server was pretty friendly too and was happy to make recommendations.

I don't find myself in Champaign often, but I'd love to come back to Sun Singer sometime."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! If you find yourself in Savoy and desperately need a quick place to eat, you should definitely stop here. They mainly have sandwiches but they sure are tasy! The day I went, the soup of the day was mushroom and brie - amazing! I will say that I wish they had a couple of taps. They have a great beer selection but there's something about having a beer poured from a tap that is extra special. They are so close to Triptych, it would be nice to see their beer there."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.. Great wine and the sandwiches are fantastic. This place is also a good place to shop for wine and kitchen accessories.
Thanks."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and keep coming back for the delicious menu and wine selections.  After tonight, I won't be returning.  The service was awful.  When I inquired about ordering dessert, the staff in the deli department rudely informed me that I can get a menu from my server.   A full hour before closing, the staff began mopping the floors, throwing garbage around, and making a lot of noise.  We got the message loud and clear and won't be back."}
{"text":"I just love Sun Singer. I've. Even a fan for years, and every visit is as pleasant as the last. Wonderful wines by the glass, and their mixed drinks are special, too. We always do olives and a cheese plate, and then dessert. It's just very pleasant. Every. Single. Time."}
{"text":"Always a win!  Love the vibe, selection and attitude!   Champaign's gem of a hangout.  Love Mark and Jackie!"}
{"text":"First of all, my wife and I hail from the east coast, where \" gourmet deli\" means something very specific. Tonight we stopped by Sun Singer for the first time, in the hopes of getting some sandwiches to take home (we have a toddler and were not able to sit and eat). Based on what we had read online, we told the hostess we wanted to order deli sandwiches. She directed us to the deli counter where we were told by the employee behind the counter, in a very gruff and brusque fashion, that we needed to order from the bar. We stood at the bar for a couple minutes trying to get someone's attention when the same hostess approached us from behind and asked if she could help. Confusing. First red flag. 
She handed us the standard dinner menu for Sun Singer. We were led to believe, based on their website, that they served deli sandwiches from the \"gourmet deli.\" With the exception of a reuben, nothing on that menu is what we would consider a deli sandwich. I don't understand why the cook behind the deli counter couldn't take some of their deli meat, deli cheese, pre-made salads and spreads, and make a sandwich. It's a simple matter to get a chalkboard, parchment paper and run a few signature deli sandwiches from the counter. Instead we were asked to order from their dinner menu.
At this point, we were simply hungry, so we ordered. 20 minutes and $32 later, we had two sandwiches from the dinner menu, a sad little portion of hummus with a small pile of veggies and one pita round cut into six pieces. TERRIBLE VALUE. All of their sandwiches are $11 or more, and considering what we received, this is absurd. The flavor of the food wasn't bad, hence two stars instead of one. 

This place is definitely NOT a gourmet deli, despite what they advertise. Do not come here looking for anything of the sort. They do have craft meat, cheese, and pre-fab sides at a \"deli\" counter, but are apparently unable to combine those into sandwiches, which is a defining aspect of a true deli. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"So happy I finally tried this place! I have to agree that the almond crusted goat cheese salad was delicious! I had it with the chicken tortilla soup, also very tasty, paired with the Kris Pinot Grigio. Pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. It was my first visit and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in the area. Whenever friends come to visit I take them here. The food is phenomenal and the service is superb. I have yet to have an experience here that doesn't impress me. 

There was one day I ordered a sandwich without cheese. The gentleman who took my order forgot to specify no cheese to the chef. Needless to say, I received my sandwich with cheese. I'm allergic to milk, otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it. He was so apologetic. They fixed my order in less than 10 minutes. Making a simple mistake is human. The way they fixed it so quickly and apologized was above and beyond. Keep in mind, I've eaten here roughly once a week or every other week for about 6 months, always ordering my food without cheese, and this was the only mistake they've ever made. 

I am shocked at the reviews that are less than 5 stars, let alone the ones less than 4 or even 3. I suspect those stories are extremely rare. So I urge you to take those with a grain of salt and enjoy a meal at Sun Singer."}
{"text":"Delicious. Wonderful Smoked Salmon Club.  Wines for all price ranges."}
{"text":"Since I have moved here I have been there a lot, recently exploring their menu. I have enjoyed all of their gourmet sandwiches, their various cheese plates as well as their deli selections. I may have dabbled into their bartenders cocktail expertise as well. I am not a fan of cole slaw but found theirs to be very good. And although I don't have the palate of a world renowned chef, I found their potato salad to be absolutely delightful. I recommended Sunsinger to my out of town friends and family when they come to visit. Helpful, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable staff that is there for you."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I still can't believe it has been so long since I last came back to Sun Singer. My wife still feels that this is the best restaurant in Champaign as they have fresh fish that rotates every week. I decided to come back during restaurant week, however there deals were so so. For dinner they had 7 dollar apps, if you get a cheese plate and 2 glasses of wine it would be 1 price for the 2 glasses of wine, and also 50% off dessert with each entree purchase. Finally they gave a certificate for 10 dollar off brunch if you spent enough money. I did not realize they had seating in a dining room area to the left side of the restaurant which would move the kids away from the bottles of wine that were not kid friendly in the past. Our waiter was quite friendly and took our orders promptly. The cheese plate lacks the presentation of the cheese plate at V Picasso, however I can't complain with the free warm complimentary bread. My main dish was the prime rib that was had perfect flavor and cooked to order. The one downside was the food was only borderline warm and the sides that the prime rib came with were a bit plain. Mash potatoes (reminded me of a cafeteria ice cream scoop serving) and broccoli, sides of asparagus and maybe loaded mash potatoes would compliment this dish better. Finally the tiramisu was good, but the chocolate dressing was a bit much masking the delicate texture and flavors of tiramisu. As this is my wife's favorite restaurant we will be back, however it does carry a hefty cost as our meal cost about 100 dollars with tax and tip and no alcohol."}
{"text":"We used to love this place and the personal cozy feel of it. But it appears that recent expansion has brought the service level down. Wonder if they made seating 2-3x but kept kitchen the same. Lunch took two hours for sandwiches."}
{"text":"This has turned into our go-to place for take out.  Great place to get food to go or to dine in!   Staff is friendly and always willing to recommend a bottle of wine"}
{"text":"I got the grilled cheese w/ apple and figs that other reviewers raved about and the lobster bisque. The sweet and salty flavor of the sandwich was unique and definitely delicious! The bisque was very flavorful too. 
But I was definitely not pleased with the price or the portion size. I really want to give this place just 3 stars because they are so overpriced but then again so is everything else in C-U. People that live around here must be used to over paying on food to think these prices are reasonable.
So I will give back one star because the service was pretty attentive (before it got busier in there) and the place was clean, cozy, and charming. I'd go back only because the food is good and because I'm starting to get used to the fact that restaurants in C-U really are more over-priced than anywhere else I've eaten in the world."}
{"text":"This place is definitely amazing if you want to try out a new wine especially because the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The food is also fairly inexpensive, but I'm not quite sure how much I like it. The food portions can be a bit small, and I don't eat beef and that was very prevalent on the menu. The vegetarian wrap and bruschetta were very delicious though! I'd definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Best top shelf liquor selection I think in champaign, with a nice variety of wine bottles and many, many shelves of imports and microbrews.  The deli is great if you need a simple brie or some salmon spread, but doesn't have the selection that ye olde time meat and deli shoppe does for meats, or EuroMart for cheeses.  

Plan ahead if you need to visit the deli at the last minute for cheese for a party, it is sloooowwwwwwww and invariably takes longer than I think it's going to, causing me to be late."}
{"text":"Here is a surprise hole in the wall eatery nestled in small strip mall close to the university a little east thereof ! As my pic shows I had the schnitzel . Preparation was very on par to high end establishments of finer more glitzy five star restaurants. I enjoyed the ambiance of huge wall mounted TV that displayed a roaring fireplace ... not real....but certainly looked as though it were crackling in its place! We finished off the meal with a luscious maple bread pudding....that our server \"Jamie\" so graciously recommend! By the way.....the food was delivered as soon as our orders rolled off our tongues! Jamie the amazing server.....came and got us while we enjoyed some free wine tasting...to ensure our food was hot for our enjoyment! All around GREAT EXPERIENCE.....at Sun Singer!!!!!"}
