{"text":"The Jerk Joint is stuck away in that market off Queen, which makes it less of an eye-catcher but the jerk is amazing! Went for lunch and had the wing snack box (jerk wings and jerk fries). The wings were perfectly spiced, juicy and delicious! My friend had the small jerk chicken with rice and beans and loved it. Portions are a bit smaller and prices a bit higher than some of the other spots downtown but definitely still affordable for great food. And an added location bonus- that hidden square just behind the market is a perfect picnic spot!"}
{"text":"The Jerk Joint is a take out place in an indoor food court with standing tables.  You can tell that the staff is meticulous regarding cleanliness which was good to see.    I ordered a large jerk chicken dinner with rice and peas which also comes with coleslaw.  The portion is a little smaller but reasonable given the $10 price point but the chicken on this day seemed to be more bone than meat.  You can also order small which I believe is approx $7ish.    I've posted a picture on here and the food kind of tastes like how it looks.  There are some better jerk chicken places where the flavor is less dependent on the gravy (i.e. Raps).  Truth be told there is not much taste to the chicken when not soaked in the gravy.  Now the gravy itself is not bad with a spicy kick to it.  It kind of tastes similar to a place that I used to go up in Markham called Yummy Jerk.  Not sure how to explain it but it has more of your 'standard' jerk flavor."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and decided to check it out.Just needed a snack so I ordered the jerk fries.Nice concept and killer kick with the jerk sauce.Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm eating their Jerk Chicken Wrap right now and it's unbelievable. Moist and juicy with a nice dry heat. Spicy but doesn't overwhelm the flavours. Well-priced to at $7.50! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken! Very tender and has a nice smoked flavour. Also got the wings which were also great. Price was acceptable. $11 for a pound of wings and $13 for the large chicken+rice + plantain after tax. Some cons: wings had a lot of burnt bits, there wasn't much gravy for the rice, $2 extra for five tiny pieces of plantain.  I would return Coz the flavour is addictive!"}
{"text":"The chicken is juicy, and the service is friendly. This place is tucked into a strip mall at the very back of a well-walked area of Queen West near Muchmusic. They give you a discount if you bring your own take-out containers. My colleagues and I will often stop in there mid-day for lunch because the servings are filling and the staff are friendly and take the time to explain the various dishes to those of us n00bz who are not veterans of the carribean cuisine. kudos to them! lunch will run you about 10$."}
{"text":"First time ordering - had BBQ chicken & sweet potato fries, jerk pork & peas & rice and a side of plantain.   The fries weren't anything special - a bit undercooked actually  The BBQ chicken was delicious and tender.  The jerk pork was also really good The plantain a little greasy.   I think I'll go there in person next time - delivery was $7 - expensive and while not regretted, it's the kind of place I think I'd prefer to visit"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner through Uber Eats. The order was incorrect. The Jerk Joint was unwilling to rectify the issue. Terrible customer service and rude staff, unable to accept an error was made. No refund, no apology. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken! Best I've had in the GTA. Wait was long but well seasoned, good flavour, and large portions. Had the jerk fries and jerk chicken and was not disappointed. Well definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of finally trying out The Jerk Joint and what a pleasant experience it was! First comes first, the service! Amazing friendly and welcoming crew providing genuine warm service! Yup it's good service! Moving on to the food I had the jerk chicken with jerk fries...wow! Great taste, well made and you can't have enough. The chicken was tender and soft, while the fries was all what you would expect. Freshly home made jerk fries with spices that dominate your taste buds. Heads up it's a bit spicy, it was perfect for me but some people might find it more on the chili side! Overall great experience, very well priced, and definitely deserves future visits!"}
{"text":"I work in the neighborhood and dropped in for lunch. Food was really good. Had the small jerk chicken ($8) - the chicken was spiced very nicely and the pepper was just right, not overpowering. The rice was very savory and fresh (not dry). Last was the slaw; a small portion but more savory than creamy. I now get the large jerk cause the chicken is wicked!!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place and didnt think much of it... you definitely cannot judge a book by its cover.   I had the Small Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas + Coleslaw. The Jerk Chicken was amazing! It was marinated inside the skin and outside and was just perfectly flavorful! Rice and Peas i've had at other places are usually pretty bland but not at the Jerk Joint... Rice was packed with flavor as well. The coleslaw was good as well, but I wish they would give more. I've also had the BBQ chicken here and it is definitely a favorite!  On top of all that, the chicken is Certified Halal."}
{"text":"The food is good. but sometimes the customer service is bad. They won't tell you prior to if they've run out of an item. They won't update their online menu for third party apps. They're just negligent when it comes to customer service. As if they don't care for their customers. And if you bring a concern to them, it's met with attitude."}
{"text":"Just had dinner from here: curried chicken with rice and potatoes. Overall, the Jerk Joint is the perfect trifecta of great tasting food, with good potions, at an affordable price.   I really enjoyed my meal from here. The cashier was very welcoming and courteous, the curried chicken had a nice kick to it, the meat was tender, and the potatoes and rice were flavourful. I got their regular size and couldn't finish my meal- the portions are very reasonable.    I definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. I'll be going back for more."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I've been there 3 times and served by 2 ladies. Both of them are pissy and have an attitude. Last time I went, the cashier instantly got mad at me because I didn't know the regular jerk chicken comes with rice and peas unless I say I want fries. WHAAAAT? It's their job to let the customers know about what they serve and it doesn't justify her actions. I'd rather walk more and get jerk chicken somewhere else than be treated like this."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this place based on the chicken roti ($9.50).  The roti is very large. That's pretty much all it has going for it. And the size simply meant I had to throw more waste into the green bin.  The \"boneless chicken\" is indeed boneless, but is barely chicken. A medley of gristle and stringy bits, from which you can attempt to pry some shards of edible meat. It seems like something I might have to eat if I were in hiding during a war, and a local butcher smuggled me unsellable scraps to save me from starvation.   There were parts of the roti that were very dry and literally made me cough.  The flavour could be likened to pureed cauliflower - rather tasteless and forgettable.   I ended up throwing 60% in the trash.   All that said, I have heard good things about the jerk fries. Maybe try those instead."}
{"text":"wow the jerk chicken was succulent and flavourful... great portions and definitely hits the spot"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Just ordered from here through Uber Eats for the first time and I will definitely be ordering again !"}
{"text":"Located inside a dilapidated plaza that seems to have a hard time retaining tenants, the Jerk Joint is surprisingly busy during lunch hours.   I love Caribbean cuisine so I had to try the chicken jerk wrap here. The cashier is not the friendliest person, but hey, we all have bad days. Overlooking the poor service,  the chicken jerk wrap tasted like someone put a whole chicken in the blender (bone and all) and scooped it onto a tortilla wrap. Every bite of this wrap consisted of shards of chicken bone... I have never ate anything so gross.   Needless to say, I could not stomach the thought of eating blended chicken on top of the inconvenience of picking out chicken bones with every bite. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Very good! Get the jerk chicken wrap!!! They only take cash and there is no seating. I tried a little of everything and wasn't disappointed. The wrap and the fries is a lot!! Very filling and delicious"}
{"text":"I remember trying this place before but my friend reminded me about it today as I was considering my dinner options. I usually go to another place for jerk for a sitdown meal but this is a great take out place.  I came after work and it wasn't busy, so I can't comment on the service during busy times, but the staff were really nice and friendly with me.  I got the jerk chicken meal with peas rice and coleslaw. I like that this is one of the few places I tried that actually makes it spicy. For my spice tolerance, it's at the enjoyable level where you can feel the spice but continue eating it. However, if you're not used to spicy food this can easily be too spicy.  I was offered gravy with rice which probably made it even better. It looked like a large portion at first but I could've easily finished it all (I got regular) but decided to save some for tomorrow.  The whole meal cost $11 after tax which is a great value especially for the area.   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's the first time i order from The Jerk Joint and it's definetely not the last time!  We ordered jerk chicken and it came with rice and peas! The meal was fresh and delicious! Customer service is great! We ordered festival and it was done on spot! I thought festival was eaten as a dessert until they told me that it is actually eaten with jerk chicken ! It tasted amazing so make sure the next time u order jerk chicken ask for festival on the side to eat with the chicken!     for jerk chicken lovers this is a place to try! Put in mind that it's only take out! There are no tables."}
{"text":"Bomb Tingz! Had an amazing jerk chicken with rice and peas for lunch. Extremely juicy and flavourful, falling off the bone. Also got a side of plantains which was really sweet and caramelized. Sooooooo gooooood! Will be back to try the chicken roti!"}
{"text":"This place is no longer in business or located here.i just stepped inside the establishment and the place is cleaned out. No notice of new ownership posted."}
{"text":"I really liked their jerk sandwich but for $7.50 for just a sandwich (coco bread, yam, tomato and jerk chicken) is pricey. We also order a fried chicken combo but they gave us jerk chicken instead even though we corrected her when she was punching in our order. The jerk chicken came with rice & peas and a side of coleslaw (size of a take out sauce container...). The flavours were alright at best.. Not the traditional spice I'd expect but good for people who can't handle the heat but like the flavours.   I feel like I can get a better deal elsewhere in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down the best jerk pork I've ever tried.  Not only was the pork tender and juicy but the seasoning was absolutely spot on.  It had an incredibly addicting medley of salty, sweet, tangy, spicy, smoky, and hot all going on at the same time.  The heat from this dish was deceptive as it kind of creeps up on you and provides a nicely satisfying burn at the end.  Fantastic place that I'd recommend to anyone who loves Jamaican food."}
{"text":"Went with a friend here to grab a bite and ordered small jerk chicken with rice which was about $8 , reasonably priced . Although the service wasn't great cause I don't recall paying for the workers attitude, the food nonetheless was okay, nothing amazing , pretty mediocre jerk. Maybe  would come back again , as long as there isn't attitude that comes along with the food ."}
{"text":"This is a place to stop in when hectic Queen St. West has given you an appetite. Right across the street from the Much Music parking lot, The Jerk Joint has trad and new Jamaican treats. Roti, jerk wings, a choice of three different potatoes including JERK FRIES. so delicious!"}
{"text":"ordered delivery from Foodora. Got Whole jerk chicken ($17.60), rice and peas ($4.40), jerk fries ($3.75), plantain (6 peices/$2) and festival ($2.20 each). Chicken; spices is good. Not dry yet not moist either... just ok, gravy has a vinegar base that was unexpected but didn't mind it. Rice and Peas, I'm used to rice and peas slightly more cooked,  plantain and festival were good and my favorites though a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I ordered the Jerk Chicken Wrap. Do not be fooled by its compact physique; it packs a hearty, flavourful punch with a lingering spicy flare. The wrap is just the right thickness, holding its shape and the contents. The sauce-to-filling ratio was also perfect, keeping the chicken moist and marinated.    I had a taste of the boneless curry chicken and it was unbelievably tender!   I also received a complimentary sample of jerk fries by the friendly chef :) the jerk spice really brings the fries to a new level, especially when they are freshly pan-fried!  Expect a line-up at this place, which will only grow as its name spreads. Also, be warned that standing in line with an empty stomach is quite brutal. You will be tempted by every aroma drifting your way, while making a mental list of everything you want to try.   Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out the other day because I had a hankering for plantains.Tried their single order of jerk chicken, an order of plantains, coco bread with beef patty and their festival. The presentation may not look beautiful, but it is excellent food. They made the festival fresh for me, so it was piping hot, golden yellow and crispy. It reminded me of a crunchier version of Chinese \"ox-tongue fritters\" and its sweetness complemented the spices from the jerk chicken well. Plantains were also delicious and helped bring down the residual jerk chicken heat on my palate. Coco bread with patty was quite delicious too, but I couldn't taste the coconut in the bread. Overall, a great cheap eats spot."}
{"text":"A surprisingly popular destination among my co-workers (who I have not, hitherto, seen frequenting food courts or food court-esque venues in this case), Jerk Joint specializes in jerk chicken, as its name would of course suggest! Also offered are rotis, soup, coleslaw, plantain, chicken wings and other Caribbean or Caribbean-inspired fare, with most items priced below $10 (pre-tax). I tried the jerk chicken wrap, which combines the signature protein with what I believe was a chipotle sauce and then a subtler layer of vegetables. I thought it was alright, but not awfully memorable. My sister, however, also had the same style of wrap and quite liked it! For that reason my (our) review is no lower than three stars. From my experience, I think you are better off getting a dish that is true to the joint's strengths (e.g. chicken with rice). I have yet to venture to try other Caribbean joints in the city (Rasta Pasta, I think you're next!) but after doing so I may be in a better position to compare."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because it's late(8:00pm) Saturday-but these guys just delivered food that was so dry and so stale....I had to throw most of it out. No I threw all of it out after a few bites. How can they have 4 stars? Oh and this is the second time. I wanted to give them a chance. Never again."}
{"text":"Great food and great people.   The Jerk Joint had been on my radar since first catching wind of it a few weeks ago, but I never seemed to be in the area so when I happened by yesterday and saw the sandwich board, I knew it was fate.  Though not in the greatest location - it's in that little \"mall\" just east of Everest on Queen W - the food and the staff more than made up for it. And, the kitchen with a full view of the operation really helped too.  The menu looked to have about 15-20 items from whole chickens to jerk dinners, sandwiches, poutine and sides, so there's a solid variety with very reasonable prices. My up-sized dinner was $9.50 plus tax and I was pretty full when I finished eating.  After looking over the menu and asking a LOT of questions, the woman behind the counter not only asked if it was my first time, but suggested a few orders for a first-timer as she wanted to make a great first impression.   I was sold right there.  So, I ordered a smoked jerk pork w/ rice and beans and was really happy with the portion size and the food. The pork was perfectly moist, with a kick that would be a bit over white-y hot and the delicious jerk flavor penetrated the meat. In fact, I received the last order because the remaining pork hadn't marinated for 48 hours. Wicked!  The massive side of beans and rice topped with gravy was really tasty and the suggestion that I mix the coleslaw in with it was brilliant. - rice never tasted so good.  I couldn't have been happier to give the Joint my business and I'm definitely going back to give them more."}
{"text":"Way Over priced, food is meh, I am big jerk chicken fan and I wasn't impressed... small size for the price... picture below is the size of their large... bone is chopped so expect some surprises when you are chewing... they also charge you 0.25 for using debit   Will not return"}
{"text":"Got a regular-sized jerk chicken.  Half of the tray was chicken, the other half split between rice and coleslaw. The meat was a bit on the salty side, but there was definitely some spicy.  I was expecting something bigger, but it's a decent meal for almost $11."}
{"text":"I think it will depend on the time you come here- the chicken can be a bit dry. A really great smokey flavour the the chicken. I would come here when i miss bbq chicken. even the sauce has a nice smoke flavour to it. smaller portions than usual."}
{"text":"I tried the jerk chicken with rice and beans & coleslaw and gravy. The chicken was too charred for my liking, it made the whole meal taste burnt. There weren't very many beans in the rice and beans. The rice, beans, coleslaw and gravy were all ok...just overshadowed by the burnt taste."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is really good. I orderd the small size and the portion was good but the chicken pieces were small, not alot of chicken. The fat lady with short hair is extremely rude and looks like she hates her life lool"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We weren't expecting much because there were so few reviews online but we were very impressed. The chicken roti was loaded with delicious tender chicken. The jerk chicken was delicious. Perfectly spiced and juicy. They also have some of the best rice and peas I've had anywhere. If you're craving quality Jamaican food in downtown Toronto (not easy to find!) give this place a try."}
{"text":"While I was walking by in the downtown core, I have always noticed The Jerk Joint with their amazing deals, so I finally decided to see what was all the hype is about.  The Jerk Joint is an amazing place to eat from if you are looking for a quick and easy lunch.  Although I have not eaten a lot of ethnic Jamaican delicacies, other than numerous Jamaican beef patties, I would have to say that this place would be a place to go if you are looking for some home style Jamaican cuisine. I tried the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wrap , and honestly it was one of the best things I ever ate in my life, literally.  There is an amazing balance of sweet and spicy with a little kick in spice in every bite.  The chicken was marinated to perfection and they take a lot of pride giving each customer some amazing food.  The customer service was very pleasant , although they were very busy, they still managed to keep a smile on their faces, and were very helpful. They treat each customer with a friendly smile and service and that was very great to see.  I will definitely come to this place again whenever I have the chance because, seriously I want more of the Jerk Chicken at The Jerk Joint."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is spicier than other popular carribean places in town (e.g. The Ritz) but it's super tasty nonetheless. I ordered the small and it came with rice and peas and coleslaw--all delicious. I added a side of thinly sliced, caramelized plantains for a touch of sweetness."}
{"text":"I came to this place randomly thanks to a coworker and I'm glad he brought me here!  I got the small BBQ chicken (jerk is too spicy for my pansy ass) and it came with rice and peas and coleslaw. I'm a huge coleslaw fan and honestly it's not the greatest coleslaw but I'll live.   The chicken is BBQ'd right in front of you and the BBQ sauce they put on it is sweet and tangy which I loved.   I believe for a small is about $7 something and it's so worth it!  Service can be a little slow so I'd recommend ordering before to pick up"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time for lunch. Tons of options and all leave you satisfied.  The Jerk chicken is the best in Toronto. Decent price and leaves you stuffed.  The employees are very nice and make your meal with little wait."}
{"text":"Coworker recommended, a bit of a walk from our work, preordered in advance. Was ready by the time it arrived....this is the best jerk chicken in town...and trust me I've had a few places of jerk chicken which doesn't make me an expert but I know what I want in my jerk.   Jerk chicken is suppose to be spicy but not overpowering in spicyness...it should also have different tones of herbs and marinated deeply into the meat...my take on jerk chicken...matching with perfect rice, peas and coleslaw..   This place has it all, rice n peas, coleslaw, tender pieces of jerk chicken, small is quite big already so I personally think it's good enough, guys may need more (not trying to be biased here), maybe a large..$8.25 plus taxes, approx $10 for fresh jerk,  made on the day of...   Oh and did I mention,  you can order via foodora and get it delivered right to your door....we're making this our friday ritual from now on....  And jerk chicken does taste different @ all places...listen to the experts!!!"}
{"text":"Fortunately the quality of food is very good.. The service was poor, 4 people in line and they couldn't have moved slower, their faces appeared PAINED by the experience of having to be working. This dismal mini food mall has struggling since it's beginnings.  75 percent still vacant.  Too slow for return visit, unless no line."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I have either passed by this place or gone in and just turned around. One day, after I was told I had to try this place - I was addicted.  It's not just the food though. It's the customer service. The very first time I went, there was one woman working on an unexpectedly busy Saturday. She kept apologizing which was so sweet and sincere but what amazed me was that the other people waiting to place an order were willing to wait. Which meant to me - it was worth the wait.    I was super happy I did.   The jerk chicken with rice and beans one time, white rice another with a side of coleslaw and an order of plantains has been my staple. The chicken is tender and flavourful and the gravy is that firey kick I did not expect to enjoy as much as I do. Coleslaw is a nice way to balance the heat, I tell ya.  The customer service here is second to none. Always helpful and friendly. No matter who is working, I have to say they are consistent. It's funny how often I go to places and people that work their don't realize how much it really means.   It may seem like that deserted mall is not worth a second look but I ask you to make the effort to go in this time round and give this place a chance. It's worth the effort for your tastebuds enjoyment."}
{"text":"I'll be honest; I was all set to give the Jerk Joint the lowest rating allowed by Yelp. I ordered a Jerk Chicken Wrap and then proceeded to wait more than 15 minutes for it to be prepared. It seemed like the folks behind the counter were more concerned with Ritual and UberEATS orders than those of us waiting in person. (I similarly saw a woman wait an absurd amount of time for a simple order of fries.)  I could go off on a rant on good customer service but instead I'll just talk about the food. When I finally did get my wrap and I took my first bite, I was very impressed by just how flavorful it was. The chicken was juicy and well spiced, the sauce was finger-licking delicious, and the whole thing had a delectable crispy shell from being toasted. I would absolutely eat this item again.  It's a shame about that service, though."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken had pieces of bones mixed in with the meat and they ran out of rice & peas around dinner time. The jerk pork was more fattening than I'd liked."}
{"text":"Good jerk chicken but not as good as Ritz. This was actually my first try at jerk chicken two years ago. Loved the chicken but the jerk fries were awful (too much spice). It's a solid meal but Ritz on Yonge st has better taste and a great lunch special.  Would reconsider if Jerk Joint added a $5-$6 lunch special.    3 stars out of 5.   Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Spicetastic! You know how when you go to a sushi restaurant only to find out the staff are not Japanese you come away feeling a little bit cheated and ripped off? No such worries at The Jerk Joint (except I very much doubt they have sushi) because they are the real deal. Prepare for fantastic spicy chicken, planteen and wraps. The chicken is so delicious. The Jerk fries are also great but I will not order them again simply because French Fries I mean Jerk Fries like all fries are carcinogens. As delicious as it is the prices are high and remember this is a take-out stand with nowhere to sit and basically in a construction zone that is as rundown as they come. So it is a battle of authenticity and taste versus price and amenities."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Pretty good - Decent portion for the price - Friendly staff  Cons: - Can sometimes be a little too salty for my taste - Can be slow if food isn't ordered ahead of time  Ordered: $9.50 Large Jerk Chicken - Overall satisfied. Not the best I've had but still pretty good.  Conclusion: Overall I'm pretty happy with The Jerk Joint. The food is tasty and prices are good. The place is mainly take-out so I would suggest ordering ahead of time to avoid a wait during peak hours. The jerk chicken I ordered had a ton of meat, consisting of half the container. The rice and peas are above average. Only thing is the food can sometimes be a little too salty. Other than that, I'd recommend The Jerk Joint."}
{"text":"Helpful hint #1: there are no seats Helpful hint #2: order ahead of time (can view the menu online)  Rating: 3.6/5 (review on pickup/food)  Looking for some delicious lunch, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Originally, I had high expectations because I love Jerk Chicken (Rasta Pasta for the win!) and my friend, who I dearly trust, recommended I try it out for lunch. After reading some reviews, I decided to call ahead for my order since I was a good 7-8 minute walk away and not knowing how busy it would be when I arrived.  Order: Large jerk chicken w/sweet potato fries ($10.75 tax included) - chicken was good - good mix of spices/herbs, but once you finished the skin, I thought the chicken was ok - sweet potato fries were a bit cold - I did get there a little after 10 minutes, so that is my fault  Overall: - very easy to make a call and order was taken without any issues, so good customer service - when I arrived, food was ready, all I had to do was make payment - cashier asked if I wanted gravy on the chicken once I arrived, which was nice of her - I wouldn't say I'm itching to come back, but, I would come back for their Jerk Chicken Wrap which I was told to order  Helpful Tips: - Better to order ahead of time (if you know what you would like to order) - no seats, all standing room - 238 Queen St. W - (Inside the Queen Live building, in between Me Va Me and Warehouse on Queen St.)"}
{"text":"Not awful, but I don't think I'd have another go. Fell a little short for me on quality and execution. The Jerk was a little soggy, didn't have the char or crisp skin that I really appreciate. The rice and peas were fine, and so was the gravy. The fried chicken also was a little dry, but came across a little better than the jerk. Typical Toronto core mediocrity."}
{"text":"To go only...no where to sit.  They were out of veggies and plantains. Food was good.  Would go back next time in the area."}
{"text":"One of my first meals in Toronto. I ate the shit out of the jerk chicken plate here. So flavorful, great spicy kick, awesome rice and beans. Loved the cole slaw but they didnt give me much. Definitely needed a lot more. Overall, I was super full from the plate and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner through Hungrhub, I got one pound of jerk wings and boneless curry chicken (meat only).  The wings came whole (drumettes, wingettes and tips attached), seemed darker and dryer than what I was used elsewhere, but they were not bad, actually quite spicy.  The curry was okay, the carrots a bit undercooked and crunchy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but probably the worst jerk chicken I have ever had. Chicken was very dry and the rice was clumpy and cold. Jerk seasoning was good."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of variety and always fresh. Home made hot sauce very good and owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Had the boneless chicken curry with rice and peas and coleslaw.  Thigh meat vs breast  meat which is more juicy, curry sauce was nice and portion size was good.  Cost was $11. They don't have the standard Caribbean sides like doubles or aloo pies but you can get plantain and some different buns and treats, etc...  This place is within a small queen street plaza across from much music so there is no place to eat or be seated unless you want to sit in the park behind the building which can be nice.  Service was very quick and very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I'm usually a pretty mild and reserved person. If you look at my profile, this will be the first review I've written on Yelp despite being a longtime user.  I ordered from here two hours ago, and I'm still pissed enough to want to share my experience. The last time I was this upset was when I was in grade 2 and this jerk named François stole my only Pokemon card. I never got that card back. Fudge you François and darn you to heck. So why am I upset? Why am I writing this petty review? Its not about the food, so why do I feel the need to relate this to a bad experience I had when I was 7?  I ordered the regular sized jerk chicken meal. After tax and an extra 25¢ fee to use the machine, the price was ~10.50$. Regardless if I'm dining in or taking out, I usually tip on my orders because I worked in retail for 2 years. I know what it's like to deal with annoying customers. For that reason, I am one of the most polite customers a restaurant could ask for. So for about 14$, I got rice, beans, 2 half sized drumsticks and 2 half sized thighs. After I got my stryrofoam takeout container, I realised I needed another pair of plastic utensils because I was sharing with my girlfriend.   So I ask, very politely, mind you, \"Hey, I'm sorry. Can I have another pair of utensils?\" What does she say? \"not really. it's only one per order\". I was dumbfounded. Are you really not going to give me some extra plastic utensils? I spent 14$. What does a fork cost, 1/2 a cent? Interesting way to cut on costs. So go ahead and call me annoying suburban soccer mom, but atleast now I know why this place is called the JERK joint."}
{"text":"When it comes to Jamaican food, Jamaicans are like canines... If it's there, we will find it. Such was the case on my recent trip to Toronto when I had the sudden craving fi sum yardie food (apologies to non-Jamaicans for the slang)  I had about 30 minutes to kill before a meeting and I found Jerk Joint via a Yelp search (as always). I ran three blocks and picked up a large order of jerk chicken with rice and peas and plantain. Since this is a take out place located in a mini food court, I had my meal at one of the stand up tables.   The meal was plentiful and overall really good. It was definitely a more authentic jerk sauce than most places use. Not very spicy, but authentic in taste. The chicken was good quality and the rice and peas were very good. My only qualm is that the plantains are not included in the dish and had to be ordered separately. Blasphemous...  All in all this is a great Jamaican food option for those in the downtown Toronto area. Authentic, reasonably priced and fast. I'll definitely be back on my next go round."}
{"text":"I ordered the small jerk chicken with white rice and coleslaw and almost choked on the little pieces of chicken bones! There were these black pieces which could've been either chicken guts or seasoning. Also, it was too spicy for my liking... my tongue was numb at the end of the meal. I would NOT be going back there."}
{"text":"I'm typically a fan of spicy food, but I found this a bit overwhelming. My friend and I both ordered the jerk pork meals with rice, and neither of us could finish the entire thing. While the first few bites had a delightful kick, by the fifth spoonful, it was more pain than pleasure.  That said, for those whose heat tolerance is greater than mine, this is probably a tasty meal. The small size is probably far larger than you'd imagine!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large jerk chicken because of $ off with Ritual points.  Chickens not very good, and you only get 1 leg.  Not a fan of their hickory? flavored rice.  Whole thing was disappointing."}
