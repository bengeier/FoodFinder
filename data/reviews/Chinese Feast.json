{"text":"Great take out for party trays. And the owner is very nice! Will definitely be back for upcoming events."}
{"text":"My family and I come here at least once a week for quick, delicious, Chinese food takeout. The establishment is incredibly small, only about 3 tables 2 chairs each. However, their food is so tasty, portions are amazing and the price is more than reasonable; almost a steal. Everyone who works there is so nice. They remember their customers well and it's very family oriented.  My go to dishes are the:  Beef Flat Noodle - Stir fried rice noodle with soy, green onions bean sprouts and beef.  Cantonese Chow Mein - They use the freshest ingredients. Stir fried noodles topped with shrimp, squid, bbq pork, beef, chicken, baby bok choy, carrots in sauce.  Deep Fried Chicken - Sliced chicken that is crispy, moist,juicy and tender.  Deep Fried Porkchop - Porkchop seasoned with chili pepper, salt and lots of garlic. So tasty!  Overall this place is incredibly underated but I always reccomend."}
{"text":"Update : Friday 12/30/2016  Dropped in to get some take out dinner for the family.  First time in years that I have been disappointed in coming here. I learned about a month or so ago that there was a change of ownership in Chinese Feast. Along with a price point increase in the various dishes, about a $0.50 - $1.00 increase. Still within affordable range of being below $10/dish.  Tonight I ordered take out of : Mixed vegetables, Fried Chicken Fried Rice and Shanghai Fried noodles. In the past these dishes were usually consistent. However tonight, the mixed vegetables was too salty, along with the batter of the boneless fried chicken in the fried chicken fried rice being equally salty. The shanghai noodles I requested no cabbage, yet when we opened the container when we got home..what did I find?? Cabbage.  Ugh..may have to re-evaluate over the next coming months if this will continue to be my go to spot for affordable chinese take-out. First time I had to brew a pot of Japanese Genmiacha to go with a meal from Chinese Feast. I will let my 4 star rating remain due to affordablilty."}
{"text":"Looks like it's under new management and is the 3rd change since I started coming here. This change appears to be for the better as food quality in my last 3 visits since is up a few notches."}
{"text":"Food always taste great...ie fried noodles chow mein yummmy. It is always hot and fresh thats why i keep coming back."}
