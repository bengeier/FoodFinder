{"text":"My friend and I ordered the famous fried chicken sandwich and the dirty nachos.  I was surprised how tasty both dishes were - not your typical sandwich and nachos even though both were made with simple ingredients.  The flavors were just delicious !!!   Small venue and music is loud but the food was sooo good !"}
{"text":"Just can't stay away from, maybe the best fried chicken in Toronto, definitely during the happy hours @ $2 a piece! Interesting bottle/tall boy beer selection, not that many choices on tap. But ask the bartender to surprise you, and he will, pleasantly surprised. And if you got there early enough, grab a window seat and watch the city pass by on the queen street."}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW  Pickle ($3)  [7]  Yep, it was a pickle sliced in half. Tasty, of course. I'm Jewish, I love me a good pickle. But it's not fancy so don't expect to get pickled purple cauliflower or heirloom carrots.  Wings ($9)  [8]  These are those wings I was telling you about-the ones I could eat for the rest of my life and not get tired of. Light, crisp, flawlessly seasoned and coated in that lip-numbing, tongue-buzzing Sichuan peppercorn. Oh dear yes, these are good.  Nachos ($9)  [9]  Pretty damn tasty, especially the housemade cheese whiz. My only criticism would be that I wished there were more toppings to go around. You know the disappointment when you get to the bottom of the pile and they're just a bunch of naked sad chips- yes, definitely a #firstworldproblem.   Devils on Horseback ($6)  [11]  Very flavourful little decadent bites with the sweet chewy dates and luscious duck, but I wished the bacon wasn't so flabby. A touch more time in the oven would have crisped that up nicely and provided that desirable crunch.  Fried Chicken ($16)  [12]  This is pretty much all you need to really pay attention to here folks. DO-NOT-MISS-THIS-CHICKEN. After a few bites, I was totally unsurprised that Jonathan had nailed the competition at The Drake because this was impossibly perfect. Crazy hot and moist inside, and mind-blowingly crisp outside. I also loved the \"tiger tears\" (aka hot sauce) that was drizzled on top to really cut through the richness on the plate. As a side note, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do with the white bread so I got into character with the whole vibe of the place, I slathered it in mayo and ate it. Mayo is kind of like butter, right? Forget your fancy Saturday night plans. Just come here for a cheap beer and a plate of this chicken."}
{"text":"Went a few times now. I can honestly say that I've never had a menu item that I didn't like. Grrreat spot, especially if you're looking for next level fried chicken."}
{"text":"I ordered Uber Eats from Bar Fancy today so I can't speak to the service or restaurant but the fried chicken sandwich on coco bread that I had was awesome. The chicken was obviously prepared fresh and even though I wasn't sure about the sweet pickles, I actually liked them on the sandwich,  they didn't taste weird and gross like sweet pickles from the grocery store. I will definitely be checking out the Fancy hour!"}
{"text":"It's the bar you wish you had outside of your uni just to go and hangout at for a quick drink and bite."}
{"text":"We went in with mixed expectations, always enjoyed Chantecler's use of ingredients and flavour as well as price-point. Grabbing a seat at the bar and seeing the throwback minimalist kitchen with the combo hotplate and radiant heater, we were not expecting too much.  Perusing the menu, was peppered with some asian fusion pub food with some exceptions (beef tar-tar and the thai salad. The price point was completely acceptable for two people to have multiple dishes and walk out sans alcohol at $50 -$60 bucks and feel satiated.   All this said, we were blown away with what the staff could do with such minimal equipment. Beef tar tar on nori paper was next level, thai salad was crisp and a tad spicey, but the fried chicken is a suculent as you will get anywhere in town and the trademark spice blend is spicy, sweet and savoury - home run.  Open to 4am .... you really can't lose and if you have a beef tar tar with an alkaline finish at 3:30 am.... you now know where to go"}
{"text":"Okay so I'll preface this by admitting that I was fasting but was with someone that wasn't so I think that cancels out any bias. And if anything, my daylong hunger usually makes me less picky about what I'm having. We ordered the nachos, green salad, spicy Thai salad, and fried chicken. The consensus was as follows:  Green Salad: despite the trumped up description by our server, this tasted like nothing and I'd definitely skip it. Makes sense why they had to name it something so generic.  Spicy Thai Salad: a misnomer, it's not that spicy but quite good. We enjoyed this quite a bit and eating it on the prawn crackers was great. Probably the best from the night, worth trying albeit not life changing.  Nachos: they weren't bad by any stretch, but nachos rarely are. I like jalape√±os so that was nice. And reading the other reviews on here tells me that the cheese whiz was made in house - I couldn't tell. And if the chips were tostitos it wouldn't surprise me either. While I enjoyed it, and the small side of guacamole was good, it was something I'd make at home and made me wonder why I left home to eat it.  Fried Chicken: after trying a bit of my friends' fried chicken at the Chase the night before I was craving it and had heard Fancy had some of the best in town. Maybe if you like your chicken powdered with a sweet seasoning, but I prefer my chicken with a bit of salt and ideally spicy. Not so here. There was a side white sauce that didn't compensate much either and it just wasn't worth the hype for me or my wife. In fact if I went back of skip it.  The service: pretty good. People were nice, food came quickly and they were well-informed. Did it justify the automatic starting point of 18% gratuity? I just didn't appreciate that on principle but they did deserve it.  The vibe: trendy tiny spot with (I was told) an even tinier bathroom. The people are pretty and the music is solid, but not so loud that you can have a conversation. This place is probably better for drinks and oysters, strictly dinner and I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Erm mah gerd - the fried chicken is amazing. Go right now and get some!  The chicken is flavourful, crispy, and juicy. It is also paired with a delicious creamy hot sauce and two slices of white wonder bread to help soak up all that yummy fat - mmm mmm good! :)   Take it from someone who has lived in the south , you will not be disappointed.   They also do takeout/ubereats so really there is no excuse - stop reading this post and go get yourself some chicken."}
{"text":"In a city of amazing restaurants, this small bar continues to haunt my dreams.  First off - it's a great bar.  Friendly service and just a great space.  Second (and most important) - FRIED CHICKEN.  Seriously the best fried chicken I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked with a hint of spice and citrus.  Comes with homemade pickles, white bread and wedges of lime.  And squeezing the juice of the limes onto the chicken is the way to go.  I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately a friend and I didn't have the same experience as the other reviewers here...  We took a seat at the bar and were ignored for about 15 minutes by the 5-6 members of staff there. Finally made eye contact with one of them and asked for a menu.   Figured out what we wanted, closed our menus and waited... Another 15 minutes and still no one comes by. We finally got up and left when we saw the bartender hurry over to take someone else's order right beside us who had just walked up two seconds earlier.   Terrible service. Wont be back."}
{"text":"A good place to share a drink and enjoy great music. We came here on a Wednesday night, and really enjoyed the DJ playing hip hop. The spicy thai salad and nachos were good, but I wouldn't recommend the queso fundido. It was basically warm cheese wiz dip with Ritz crackers. Overall a really cozy and relaxed vibe -  I will be back to try that fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Staff are the worst. Inattentive and very rude if asked for anything ie: a menu or a drink or really anything. It's a shame because the chicken is incredible. If I could get the chicken without having to deal with any of the staff this place would be one of my faves."}
{"text":"Fancy is literally a hidden gem. (entrance trough the alley, lookout for the Tiger neon sign) I have been here a couple of times. The first time around was mainly to try the food which I was not overly impressed with. The menu was advertised as \"Cheap and Cheerful\" by a Toronto Life review. I could not disagree more $18 for fried chicken is not chaep ={ On the other hand I really enjoy the atmosphere of the bar and their beer selection is quite good. The bartender was kind enough to let me test one of their draught beers and even offered my friend and I a complementary shot. Free shot is gold!!! I will be back for more drinks for sure."}
{"text":"Food is at best average. Toronto Life gave it much more hype than it deserves. You can experience better comfort food at Jack Astors or something like that.   Service is slow and a little clueless."}
{"text":"Been frequenting bar fancy since opening. Always supported. Always loved most all of the staff. Always was kind, tip very well, and spread the word about one of my local go to' s to all I knew.  Then Superpoint opened. Same situation. Frequent at least a few times a month. Love the place. The staff. The food and service.   Which is why as a hardcore supporter of both establishments, I was extremely disappointed tonight.   I brought a friend there, for food and drinks, on my word to her that it was a great spot.   Throughout the night we ordered nachos (they were the usual, Delish) a fish sandwich (was very mediocre but nothing I'd complain about for the low price point it is) and I ordered six oysters. I eat oysters at least a few times a week. I have NEVER returned them. But I could not eat these. They were fishy, and were off to me. I had one, and left the plate there. Awaiting the waiter (a new guy whom I've not seen before) to return and acknowledge.   About 30 minutes later he did. I told him they were fishy. In the kindest way possible. I do not like to complain. He then said 'I'll see if I can take them off the bill for you\"   I then had to flag him down about 30 minutes following that asking for the bill. He delivered it. It's Aprox $120. We had also had about six glasses of rose) I looked over the bill and said 'excuse me, the oysters I returned are on here' his reply...   Yeah so, no one else complained about them all night'   He then walked away. Went behind the bar, and laughed loudly about it with your head bartender. I heard every word.   Pretty disappointed with that service."}
{"text":"Bar. Fancy.   I am here quite a bit because Bar Fancy is in my neighbourhood, open seven days a week and the eats menu runs until closing time. Need I say more? I don't, but I will.   For me, the must on the menu is the fried chicken. The skin in crazy crispy, while the meat is insanely tender. For those confused about the accoutrements, have no fear. How you want to combine the elements is a personal adventure. I tend to spill out a bit of the hot sauce and ranch sauce onto the plate. I start going nuts with the chicken, dipping and biting, alternating sauces and bites of the thick pickle slices. Then, as the delicious chicken inevitably gets messy, I use a slice of the white bread to mop up the rest. I also enjoy ordering the nachos, as they are great for sharing and have these beautiful pickled onions all over. But for more than two people, you might also want to order the beef tostada, oysters and/or the spicy salad of matchstick-cut, fresh fruits and veg.   This is a great spot for just about any meet up, whether it's a birthday, casual meeting and/or date. The staff are super friendly and come around often. Sometimes there's a DJ. It's not really \"fancy\". Bar Fancy is just a good place to be."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 (note: based on one food item so take with a grain of salt!) Atmosphere: 6.5/10  Service: 6.5/10 Overall experience: 6/10  Popped over to this place this past weekend with high hopes. The glowing tiger(?) in the alleyway that leads you to the entrance is very hipster and makes you feel like you're a part of a secret club.  There were a lot of things that contributed to an overall unpleasant experience, some of which were in their control and some not: - large cold draft where I was seated at the bar - large, rambunctious crowd beside me that edged so close they managed to spill beer on my coat - staff member gave me a point blank \"no\" and then an even blanker stare afterward when I asked if they could make a special cocktail. No worries if not - but it was literally \"no\" and then silence... - same staff member was seen on his phone at multiple times of the night (you can swipe right after your shift bro)  The cocktails were fine/normal. We had an order of the fried chicken which was really really good. Another person came to take care of us who was a lot nicer. But unfortunately, the experience had already been soured. Neither of these two elements were able to make up for it.   THE BOTTOM LINE: fried chicken is really good, everything else Iggy Azalea would most definitely pass on."}
{"text":"Not a lot of space and gets really busy 5-7pm because fried chicken pieces are $2 a piece but our host, Johnny (suave Asian sir with sweet frames), greeted me like a homeslice and took me in like his own. Sipped some DDC Ros√©e D'hibiscus while I waited for a bar seat and devoured the fried chicken like I hadn't seen food in years. The fried chicken had some sweetness which went phenomenally well with my Ros√©e D'hibiscus. The atmosphere is loud and a little hard to hear your partner but who cares about conversation - Bar Fancy is all about the fried chicken! THANKS JOHNNY FOR AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE, YOU ARE SO AWESOME, LOTS HAPPY, SUCH DELISHUS, DO WANT, MUCH BEER, WOW"}
{"text":"I was so sad today when I brought my sister to try this chicken that I had been raving about at Bar Fancy. I've been to this bar about 10 times now and it's the chicken that keeps me coming back to this bar. The chicken today was just your normal deep fried chicken - I dont know what happened but my sister was extremely underwhelmed as it tasted pretty basic. She had no idea what I had been talking about. I tried it myself and it was lacking the spices perhaps? or maybe they are now sparingly seasoning the chicken? not sure, but it tasted like plain old fried chicken with nothing special about it at all. :("}
{"text":"Must Try: Fried Chicken, Salmon Burger  Rating: (10/10) Food, (4/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:   Finding this hidden 'speakeasy' style bar required a bit of sleuthing, but once you find the green neon bear glowing dow the alleyway, you're well on your way to find this new trendy hipster (*gasp!) Toronto bar.   Be weary when you walk in, as you may be completely ignored for the first ten to fifteen minutes. We walked in on a Friday night to find the restaurant full, with a couple waiting to be seated before us. However, it took a while before anyone there acknowledged our existence, standing awkwardly by the door. The bar is very busy, mixed between groups there for the dining experience, and those there to drink at the bar. Bear in mind, the restaurant is quite small. The mix of the two crowds gives the place a feeling of being over crowded and almost too loud.   After we were eventually acknowledged, and seated, we looked through the concise menu of food and drinks. As this was our first venture to Bar Fancy, we asking the server what he recommended. He basically read off the menu (at one point saying \"yeah, that's pretty good, it's only $6, so it's not that big\"). Even with the poor suggestions, we ordered the salmon burger and fried chicken platter.   The salmon burger came, sandwiched between two piece of plain white bread. Underwhelming would be an understatement, to say the least. However, the patty was amazing, and actually worked perfected with the simple plain white bread. Delicious would be an understatement.   The fried chicken platter came, with 4 huge pieces. It took a bit longer, as each piece was prepped and fried; made to order. Taking that first bite, i felt a rush of euphoria. The crispy exterior, the juicy interior, coupled with the unique flavour infused into the batter. Hands down, one of the BEST fried chickens I've ever had, and that's saying a lot. So delicious, it made me forget all other fried chickens I've had before in my life. Let me say that you MUST try the fried chicken. The fried chicken alone gives Bar Fancy a whole extra star. Although the server brought it half-way through my meal, the hot sauce somehow finds a way to elevate the dish even further, providing the perfect amount of creamy spice to the already delicious fried chicken.   Moreover they offer a happy hour special (5 - 7pm) where Fried Chicken is $2 a piece and $1 Oysters.   Although starting on a sour note, the quality of food as well as the value you get more that makes up for the sub-par service. Open till 2 am, this is a great spot to grab some delicious food, so long as you're willing to yell a bit to talk to your friends and put up with the wait and mediocre  service."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere but the food was only okay.   We ordered:  - the dirty nachos (don't bother, they're the worst nachos i've ever had. I don't care if it's house made cheez whiz, it still tasted like cheez whiz on nachos - disgusting.) - the fried chicken - these were pretty good, i've had better at Electric Mud, but these weren't bad - the tartare - this was great and liked that they served it with seawood instead of crostini  - the spicy thai salad - this was great as well, a good mix of sweet and spicy flavours  It's a great place to try even though it wasn't one of my favourites. just don't order the nachos."}
{"text":"When I heard that Bar Fancy won the fried chicken contest at the Drake, I was curious and invited some friends to join me.  I had noticed the gold trimmed exterior for several months before and was curious as to what the space looked like on the inside as well.  We had gotten there before 7 pm on a Saturday, and they still had the happy hour menu which meant $2 pieces of fried chicken, and half price oysters.  We got both, and also an Old Fashioned to wash down the chicken.  The chicken was indeed crispy on the outside, super moist on the inside, and spiced in a uniquely Asian way.  The best part of course, is still the skin, and the batter they use is not as thick as other fast food places, and still has a lighter hue which means they use fresh oil.  The chicken pieces are generously sized, and are indeed super moist when you bite in.    The menu is quite small owing to the mini sized kitchen right next to the bar area, but I was impressed at how they managed to make all their food in such a small space.  Will definitely drop by again soon for more happy hour chicken."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a snack between 5-7PM, head to Bar Fancy, get a cocktail and get 3 pieces of $2 fried chicken.   The drinks are artfully made, the chicken is the best in the city."}
{"text":"Walked in a 1 a.m expecting mediocre - poor service considering the time of night. But our waiter Tommy was the complete opposite! The bar closes at 2, but even then my cousins and I were nervous about being \"those\" last minute customers. But upon arrival, the vibes were light and friendly. Tommy had great energy for a late and kind of busy night. All waiters and bartenders were friendly.   We ordered the fries (8-9$), cheeseburger and chicken wings (5.95$ each). The fries were massive! Wedge size to be exact. The cheeseburgers were simple yet juicy, tasty and tender. Excellent burger (11$), And to be honest we weren't the biggest fans of their famous wings. The wings were crispy but had a sweeter taste, just personal preference and we rather simple & salty chicken lol. It does however go well with this White House sauce it's served with. Also! They have the best house hot sauce. Actually spicy for once I was very surprised at the level of spice! Goes well with the fries and burger .   Didn't try the drinks so I guess I will have to try them on my next visit! Definitely recommend for a late night eat. Happy hour is from 5-7 weekdays btw and the chicken is 2$ a piece! 4 stars because of the overly hyped wings and higher prices, but I'd still come back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place with my friend on a Sunday night. The entrance is through this really suspect alley..which is kinda cool.   We ordered a plate of nachos to share which were very mediocre. They used a cheese sauce instead of actual cheese pieces. That was a big no-no for me but it came with guacamole which was a minor redeeming factor. The plate was good to share between 2 people at $9.  We also ordered a fried chicken piece each, I think it was $4.50 for 1 chicken thigh. It was pretty good.  The best part however was not the food.. or the extremely dark ambiance... it was the music. The music was so dope- a lot of throwback hip-hop which is always a win in my books. I am not sure if that is the type of music they always play or it was just that night but it was great!"}
{"text":"I came for the $2 fried chicken. It's actually the best fried chicken I've ever had. The batter is simply phenomenal and I don't know how I'll not be able to come back for more. There's no sign which is good. It's my little secret. But now that I gave it 5 stars on Yelp I'm afraid I will not get a seat at a table anymore. Please share your recipe!!!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this bar a lot the last month or so. Still haven't had the fried chicken which completely baffles me. It always smells so good yet nope- still haven't ate it! I know i'll have to change that next time.   Last time I was kind of sick of just drinking beer and I wanted to get a little 'fancy' so we asked the server to make us two surprise cocktails. I think mine was called a paper plane? It was really good though and I totally recommend it- or ask them to make you a surprise too. What can go wrong right?  Oh also my favorite thing is to sit at one of the front tables and watch as confused people try to find the front door. ( hint: it's not at the front)"}
{"text":"Believe everything that people are saying about the fried chicken at this place. Unless they are saying its bad. Don't believe those people - they know nothing.  The fried chicken is delicious. Its crunch and juicy and has both a savoury and sweet vibe to it. Its just magical. I will dream about it until I have more.   Also ordered the oysters (fresh) and the dirty nachos which were so simple yet so good - the best part is that there weren't those lonely, cheeseless nachos at the bottom - every nacho was smothered in the delicious cheese sauce (think movie theatre cheese but real).   everyday 5-7 pm gets you half priced oysters ($8 for 6 oysters) and $2/piece of chicken.  go now."}
{"text":"This place is really trendy. The interior is very modern and funky with wood paneling and interior brick. Cozy booths in the back for dates or intimate outings. They have good appetizer deals. For a tapa place, drinks are standard pricing, but they have good choices on tap, not everywhere has beaus which is nice. Service is excellent and the deal for appys are really good. Come between five and seven and have the best fried chicken. This will not disappoint. Great new local watering hole. Fits in nicely w the neighbourhood. Signage is not evident at front and entrance is at side but it gives it a speak easy vibe. Music they play throughout is mellow and makes for a very calm, chill atmosphere. Definitely more of a tapas place but they do that very well. Happy hour has amazing deals ex- two dollars for fried chicken.. Who can complain?"}
{"text":"\"Great chicken in a shitty place\" says my boy D, who knows his fried Chicken, having spent much time in the American south.   Bar Fancy is the kind of place that you read about on BlogTo, then make the trek to, when one of your more well-heeled friends suggests it. It was busy, super busy, full o the kind of people who read BlogTo but pretend not to, and had the attitude and service to match.  Everyone looked like extras from Almost Famous, it was great.   The Chicken was good, apparently the secret ingredient was all-spice. I'd go before 7 pm, because apparently the chicken on special then. Also the dirty nachos were kinda meh... I know everyone is raving about them but they weren't anything special."}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend going during their Fancy Hour (5-7pm) for their $2 chicken! So fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"If I ask you what on the menu is vegetarian, since there isn't any listing of what's in what on the menu (which is fine), please make sure you're actually telling me is vegetarian, is in fact, vegetarian.  I ordered the Thai salad, which was deliciously dressed, but it was served with a bunch of crackers.  They were surprisingly flavourful, almost too flavourful.. oh cause they are prawn crackers.  I get it, it's a chill vibe in this joint, but the server's reaction when I pointed this out, should not have been \"oh shit\" (his words exactly).   Although i didn't have any of the fried chicken, the smell of them was revolting.  It just smelled like dirty, unwashed hobos.  I don't think I'm going to come back here, and I would probably not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chill Spot with Comfort food done right! First of all, I thought the lay out of the Restaurant was smart as the entrance began to the back of the restaurant so you're immediately emerged in the ambience.  We ordered the Southern Fried Chicken which we've heard is amazing and they did not lie. I really liked that they added a light honey glaze to chicken which had great crunch and was very succulently juicy. To add to the Chicken was the fact they added plain white bread, golden and it comes with a delicious hot sauce they you could drink. We also ordered the Oysters which were delicious and their shallot vinaigrette was really well done and i want to know the secret ingredient. The Dirty Nachos were delicious and the Spinach Artichoke dip which was served with Ritz Crackers. I feel like the food here is made by someone who really puts love into their food.  Based on Food alone, I highly recommend this place for cool space and amazing comfort food. We will return again."}
{"text":"Cute little joint with nice staff and great happy hour offer - delicious $2 fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Very chill vibes here. I've been twice, both times for the 5:00 - 7:00 fried chicken and oysters deal, so was easily able to grab a table.  $2 fried chicken is a no brainer.. I'd pay double that if I missed the sale window; this stuff is fantastic.  And that window is firm; there is no ordering $2 fried chicken at 7:01.  They're basically giving it away at that price.   The nachos are something only very slightly fancier than you would get at a movie or hockey game.  Skip them and save room for more chicken.   There was a beautiful scallop special on one of the days I dined there, and it was a light and gorgeous contrast to fried chicken and super salty dill pickles (\"super salty\" is not a complaint).    No complaints about the food and drinks at all.  Service is spotty; always friendly when I had their attention but had to flag down servers for drink refills almost every time, and some of those orders simply never showed up."}
{"text":"Happy hour fried chicken is amazing. Probably also amazing during regular hours."}
{"text":"The entrance is a bit hidden at first. Came here because I heard about the fried chicken. Ordered it and it was absolutely amazing!!!!! It's tender, crispy, juicy and has many layers of flavours. If you have tried some of the Asian style fried chicken in the past, you might find a bit of resemblance in the flavour."}
{"text":"Some would say that you cannot go wrong with a piece of fried chicken, but boy, have they had a piece of Bar Fancy fried chicken? Light crispy skin, subtle five spice flavour, the perfect house made spicy sauce paired with a lime, and most importantly - Juicy fried chicken! It will send you out of this world.   I've went with my friends a few times and the chicken is so good that it became part of our daily conversation and go-to place. The beer is cold and the cocktail is great, what more can you ask for? Place is small and get packed quickly so arrive early to avoid disappointment for happy hour 5-7 weekdays."}
{"text":"Being a tad or more older than the target clientele for this tiny place is pretty great. First of all, we feel special because we figured out where the door is. Second, no one's waiting for us to be fashionably late, so we get to swing in early and be the first to take advantage of the early bird/happy hour special. Best of all, this place offers tantalizing fried chicken made hot and fresh all the time, but during happy hour, and with a drink purchase, you can order 3 pieces for only 2 bucks a pop. So grab yourself a beer and get greasy with plate of top-shelf, burning hot chicken. They serve it with a tube of kickin haba√±ero sauce, too, but I recommend eating at least one piece without no hot sauce and none of the ranch-y side dressing, JUST with a squirt of that luscious lime. It's a revelation on this delectably light, crunchy coating. The music is great here, too. Kudos, Bar Fancy, let's be friends."}
{"text":"Hidden behind an alleyway, Bar Fancy is tucked with surprises in every corner. From the 5-7pm Fancy Hour everyday where you can order $2/pc of their award winning fried chicken (limit 3 pieces for every alcoholic beverage ordered), 1/2 price oysters (comes to $8/6 oysters), to the speakeasy vibe. Loved every part of it. I will definitely come back for an oh-so-fancy meal."}
{"text":"3.5.  Service was... a little inattentive.  But fast! Professional. Not much in the way of communication, no explanation of the drink list etc. Would have loved to have heard their thoughts on that. Ambiance is tops. Very low key, happy and kitsch. Food: olives, $3, fine. Some weren't ripe and didn't have a lasting impact. Fried chicken, amazing. Brined to heaven. Coated and fried super crispy, glorious. Salty without leaving your mouth parched. Could not recommend more.  The dirty nachos, wonderful, spicy and flavourful, the liquified cheese is a lovely surprise and much more edible then shredded cheese. The guacamole is just formed, so it's akin to eating a chunk of avacado which is how it should be in my books. Not the establishments fault but boy did our table get some glares from waiting patrons. Sorry not sorry I beat ya here! I shall be returning many times! In fact i was so enjoying myself i didn't even take any pictures! Overall... chicken blew me away, love the prices and ambiance. Rest of the food was good/fine. Service was a little lacking in the sense of rapport. But the bathrooms are the absolute largest detracting factor. Clean! Super clean. But terrifying. If you are tall... good luck! I felt like someone was going to lower a basket with moisturizer to me while synth beats blasted above my head. Shudder."}
{"text":"The short form of my two experiences at Bar Fancy: the food is good, the service is so incredibly terrible I will never return.  The long form of my two experiences at Bar Fancy:   The first time I went to Bar Fancy I chose the spot for a friend's birthday. As someone who loves trying all the talked-about places in the city, I usually get to choose the spot for various events. In their defense, we did walk in with a group of 10 people. The way they handled the situation could have been significantly better. Even besides the literal (and very visible) eye-rolling we got from the staff when they had to push some tables together, the service was horrible. When an order of nachos was was forgotten, the servers actually blamed US saying that \"it got to the table but we'll get you another one\". Considering this one was ordered special (cheese on the side) we would have noticed if it had \"got to the table\". The food came extremely slowly and piecemeal so that my boyfriend got his fried chicken after asking where it was twice and after half the table had already finished their meals.  I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt and decided I would try it again (with a much smaller group of people).  So, experience number two: I came in with four people. The server got our drink and food orders and everything seemed like my hunch had been right and my previous experience could be chalked up to the amount of people we had -- I was very, very wrong. In the hour and a bit we were there, never once did the server come to ask us how the food was or if we would like another drink (the first ones being done about 20 minutes in to our receiving them).   When we finally flagged her down to get our bills and I requested the machine, the server  handed it to me without even turning toward me or looking at me. I wish I could leave a GIF of how she handed me this machine. I wouldn't hand anyone anything in that manner.  So, in conclusion, I will never go back to this place. If you want to try the fourth best friend chicken in town and you're willing to sit through excruciatingly poor service to get it, by all means. But you're better off at Stockyards,"}
{"text":"Very cool and warm little place. I just love the layout and atmosphere of this place.  Menu prices are reasonable. The meat balls are fantastic.  Cool selection of beers and the bar tender has perfection syndromes ;) It was fun sitting by the bar and watching him pour in drinks.   Entrance door kinda of hidden and took us few attempts to find it, that made the night exciting and sit the stage for a fun night.   Would want to go back again to this place."}
{"text":"This place is... just ok.   This place is divey restaurant, with a not so hidden entrance if you look hard enough. It's dark and loud, and reminded me more of a bar with bar food than an restaurant.   My boyfriend claims this is the best place in Toronto for fried chicken. I might even believe him. Super moist meat with a crunchy exterior. He's arguing with me that Bar Fancy deserves higher than a 3 star rating...  But I won't because the nachos were  let down. Maybe they're done in a different way than I'm used to... but slapping some iceberg lettuce and melted cheese on tortilla chips doesn't do it for me.   I'd come back.. in hopes the nachos have improved!"}
{"text":"Love this bar. The drinks and service are both excellent. There are big open windows at the front and some palm tree plants here and there. It's a bit loud but the music is good. I had a delicious Rosee draught beer from Quebec and a wine from a family vineyard in Nova Scotia. Our server was extremely attentive for a Friday night. Well done!  I wouldn't recommend coming here for a meal but late night snacks are appropriate."}
{"text":"Came here for supper to celebrate my anniversary. Love everything about this place! Jonathan Poon is brilliant with the creation of simple dishes with bursts of Asian inspired flavours. We ordered the must have chicken wings, numbing wings, dirty nachos, raw beef tostadas, patty melt, spicy salad, fish sandwich and another salad dish (forgot the name). All were amazing. With the exception of the dirty nachos. I think we could have gone without that as it was average.   We had a great evening with great service. Love the decor, love the service. We ordered quite a few dishes and the bill was reasonable.   I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this place (seriously because the entrance is hidden down an alley) and know that it would be open and serving food at a late hour!   Seeing all the reviews about it I decided to go with the fried chicken. I was definitely not disappointed! So good and flavourful (maybe a bit on the salty side though). We had also ordered the tacos which were delicious as well (size was similar to tacos at La Carnita... kind of small but they give you 3).   I was also enjoying the throwback hits they were playing and the overall laidback vibe of the place. It was late on a week night; everyone sitting at the bar seemed to know each other and the bartender.   Extra shoutout to the badass neon tiger sign!"}
{"text":"Just a drinks review on a Friday night.  One Manhattan one Tom Collins (which had to be looked up to make) my friend enjoyed my Manhattan more than his Tom Collins. Definitely a place for loud groups lots of selfie action. Decent cocktails but not outstanding given the price point."}
{"text":"Woww what a hidden gem - never realized oysters and fried chicken was such a great combo!!   Contrary to their name, this spot is such an unassuming and chill place that is a perfect go to for after work drinks & eats. They are so hip that they don't have front doors but you have to enter from a back entrance. Inside, they have minimalistic decor but full of the laid back charm and character.   Now on to the major highlights - we were initially enticed by the half price off dozen oysters ($8 for half a dozen and really fresh and delicious by the way) but the star of the show was definitely the fried chicken. Made to order, these $2 a piece fried chicken was sooo juicy, perfectly crispy and packed full of flavour. The seasoning they got on there was ON point - perfect balance of sweet and savoury deliciousness.   Menu is small so they know what their focus is they do it really well. Drink list has no cocktails but I heard they can make them upon request. We also tried their nachos and green salad which was just alright for me so I'd say go straight for those oysters and amazeballs fried chicken - can't go wrong with this!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review by saying I hope that my experience was an isolated one and no one else experiences the same thing because I am still very upset and appalled by the service I received from Bar Fancy.   The night started off well enough, my friend was already seated at the far back table near the door so we quickly sat ourselves around 7:15 (after \"Fancy Hour\" so everything was full price for us). No one came to provide us with the menu for a good 10-15 minutes at least, which is fine, they looked busy. After getting the menu we had some questions, which the waiter kindly answered and even provided a beer recommendation for my friend.   I'll talk about the food first and get it out of the way. It was not the best and definitely overpriced for what you're getting. But again, we were okay with that because we knew what we were getting ourselves into (I had seen the blogto post but despite the comments I decided to give a new restaurant a shot.. something I don't usually do and after this experience, I will never do again). We came for the chicken first and foremost ($18). So, I was surprised that it was not up to par at all. It was very greasy and although tender and moist (that was probably the best part about it), the seasoning did not sit well with me and I felt a bit nauseated the remainder of the night. The hot sauce it came with was amazing though - VERY spicy! We also got olives ($3, just your average olives) and the dirty nachos ($9, these were good, I liked that the nacho chips were seasoned) to start. We were still hungry so we got the shrimp burger. There was 4 of us so we asked the waiter if it could be cut into 4 pieces for us (it came cut diagonally). He responded by saying that \"the chef doesn't like to do things differently\" and suggested that we cut it ourselves with the cutlery we had. Ok fine, sometimes people are busy and don't want to do extra things, no big deal. The sandwich was probably the most disappointing out of everything we ordered. It was a sad mystery meat looking patty that didn't remotely taste like pork or shrimp and was slathered with mayo and shredded iceberg lettuce on white wonder bread (all for a small charge of $9.50!). We didn't even finish it. We also got the artichoke dip ($6) that came with the ritz crackers. I thought it was pretty good but would have liked more crackers to dip.   It was all downhill after that. When the table was cleared by another waiter (not the person who was originally serving us), he asked us how we liked the shrimp burger. His response was a nonchalant \"ok\". Even then we were not too offended (the usual response I get is \"oh I'm sorry, why not?). As our table was cleared we naturally wanted the bill and call it a night. After waiting what seemed liked a long time (I honestly don't remember) we turned around and tried to get the attention of either our waiter or the person who he was chatting with at the bar. I was waving my hand and my friend tried to get their attention as well. Even after locking eyes with my friend, he still didn't come. Then when he finally decided we were worth his time he looked over and kind of nodded at us to show that we had his attention. So I made the international sign for \"the bill\" (you know, you kind of squiggle your hand like you're signing a note in the air) and he nodded and brought it to us.   By now we were pretty upset. Especially after he blatantly ignored us and then didn't even bother to come over and ask us what we needed. He brought the bill and we split it between the 4 of us without tip included. My rule of thumb is to divvy it out and then people can tip how much they want. I usually tip in cash as I've been told by my waiter friends that it's easier than tipping on the machine, which was what I was planning on doing - DESPITE the rude service I had already received. But then when my last friend was done paying with the machine, the waiter tallied up our bills and said to us \"YOU GIRLS PAID $4 TIP ON A $70 TAB, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. FIGURE IT OUT\" and then tosses the bill back on the table and walks away. Now, I eat out A LOT, multiple times a week and I have NEVER had such appalling service. My friend was so shocked that she even went up to bar to try and explain (nicely I might add, without shouting or swearing), saying how we had our wallets out and were going to tip more but now that he said that we didn't want to anymore. At first his response was \"well a lot of people dine and dash that's why I reacted like that\" (we had already paid for the bill in full, I have no idea what he meant by that - not to mention we had ordered a substantial amount of food, not like we got the nachos and split it 4 ways). And then when my friend said how his reaction was disrespectful he told us \"well don't come back then\".   Don't worry, we will never come back."}
{"text":"Bar Fancy is a hidden little bar on Queen W with this weird alleyway entrance They have 5 to 7 pm happy hour every day with half price oysters and $2 pieces of fried chicken with the purchase of a drink. You are allowed 3 pieces of chicken per drink. The fried chicken is probably the best I've had in the city. It's crispy, golden, flavourful, and made fresh to order. It's simply delicious.  Unfortunately there's no happy hour drink specials, but it's around $6 to $8 for a beer which is very reasonable. The atmosphere is great and the windows are amazing in this place.  It's not too busy so you can definitely always find a seat in this place. I'm going back for the chicken for sure"}
{"text":"Two words: fried chicken. Have brought few friends and everyone loves the fried chicken. It is very crispy and tasty. The hot sauce is a must! The spicy salad which is not at all spicy goes with the fried chicken to refresh your palate. Be prepared to wait a little as they fry the chicken  on the spot as you order. Bartenders are always super friendly and let's us try the different beers on tap before we order. They also make great recommendations if you tell them what kind of beer you like. Place is small so go early. My only wish is that they'd have a larger selection of whisky."}
{"text":"Althought their food tastes like dog food on a tostada, and their music is absolute shit and their art is weird (serioously, rusty folded chairs on the wall is \"art\"?) this place is okay and better than that weird faux fine dining place on Queen.  I would come here for a drink with friends.  My friend likes their food but I don't so  to each their own  I guess"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a cold, wet, and slushy Saturday evening. We came just before 7pm and the chicken were half priced ($2 ea.). These definitely rival if not better than the best fried chicken around town. Hot out of the frier, they were juicy, steamy, and quite flavorful. A good place for a quick meal or snack."}
{"text":"Yet another place in this neighbourhood I'm enamoured with.  It's a little hidden (go down a narrow alley about 10 steps and the entrance is on the side of the building) which is kind of quirky but no biggie - though I can't imagine they get much casual walk-in clientelle unless you know it's here (most strangers won't go poking around an alley looking for secret restaurant entrances).  Inside, I was a bit surprised that it wasn't busy at all - this was 6pm on a Wednesday, in the heart of the $2 fried chicken happy hour.  I didn't need a crowd so this was actually a pleasant surprise.  The place is tasteful and has a reasonable amount of seating, though if it was packed it could become an issue.  Got the $9 dirty nachos and happy hour $2 fried chicken.  The nachos, although meatless, had nice soft fresh chips (at least they seemed like it - for all I know they could've been reheated) and plenty of nice toppings.  Probably the best vegetarian nachos I've ever had (and that's coming from a carnivore).  The $2 chicken was worth ever bite.  Nice and crispy on the outside, oozing with moist tender meat on the inside, and with the perfect amount of seasoning.  If you like fried chicken, you need to come just for this.  Great value for both dishes.  Their only downside from what I can tell is their drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but since I was on a tap water option that night, it didn't really matter.  There are a few other items I'd like to try on their menu next time - until then, still thinking about that chicken.."}
{"text":"Less \"Bar\" and more \"Fancy\" than imagined. We were pleasantly surprised by the bartender's skill and ended up having a great time. Really small space, with a side door entrance. Very cool vibe once inside. Definitely ask for the bartender's suggestion as they have no solid drink menu."}
{"text":"The chicken is as good as everyone is saying for sure. Skin is super crispy and inside is moist and juicy. Love the spices and salt on the skin - delicious! It wasn't too busy when we went there at 6 but filled up. Nice vibe, a bit dark. Service was solid. We had the fancy hour chicken and half price oysters. Wasn't a big fan of the cucumber mignonette though. Hot sauce was killer so we put that on everything. Need to get a drink per three fancy hour items, so final price wasn't that cheap but we enjoyed ourselves. Great place to start off the night - will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and fried chicken..best deal is happy hour. It's small so get there early"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Bar Fancy! The food was fantastic and the staff was even better. I hope to visit again when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"I love how the entrance is off to the back lead by the neon tiger. We didn't even know Bar Fancy existed - we just kind of popped  in and we were pleasantly surprised!   Beef Tartare - cubes of raw beef with a egg yolk on top - came with a side of seasoned Korean nori to wrap and eat with. It was so yummy. This dish was genius - it tasted like something from a hotel restaurant.   The ambience is decidedly Queen West - hipster, cool, low-key vibe. Loved it. Great to pop in for a snack and some drinks. Prob not for a full meal."}
{"text":"Wow! The instructions on how to enter this place were no joke as I was a bit confused on my first visit here. My tip is: just head towards the bright neon lion-head and walk slowly past it to the actual entrance. Our group of 5 had a laugh when someone commented that the way to go into Bar Fancy looked like a \"mob door\" The small menus allows for easy decision making but our primary focus was of course the fried chicken and during their happy hour it was $2 per piece (maximum of three pieces) if ordered with an alcoholic beverage. Other items that were picked from the menu were the Dirty Nachos, Queso Fundido and the Spicy Salad. I also got a dill dip for my chicken and we were also given the complimentary hot sauce. I wish we had asked what type of pepper was in it because it definitely had a burning kick to it. Due to the dimness of the lighting in our section it was a little hard to make out how crispy the chicken was but they came out piping hot from the fryer. I did come in hungry and normally I still control the speed at which I eat on an empty stomach. Man, did I wolf down the first two pieces within 30 seconds of each other! Adding the dill dip and the hot sauce to the meat also enhanced the flavors which is probably what made me eating them quickly. And the meat was so warm and moist, and the juice from the meat dripped onto the dish during the first two bites! I'll shout chin-licking goodness!! My queso fundido which was a very warm cheesy dip accompanied by several  (brand name) crackers was just as good. I think I also dipped a piece of my chicken and the cheesy taste also paired well with it.  The Nachos and the Salad which looked like the Chef's own take on a Thai salad were also praised.  Service was pretty decent and no fuss, and the guy who was our main server seemed elated when we all agree how much we liked the chicken. Oh yeah and all that the washrooms need to complete their look are a pair of hand-cuffs near the flusher and maybe one near the sink LOL. So now I'm a fan, but add a small selection of desserts to your menu and I'll be a bigger fan."}
{"text":"Bar Fancy is anything BUT fancy. That's not to say it's a terrible thing, just lower your expectations. I went here with a group of friends for happy hour and I was disappointed to find their food specials were contingent upon how much you drink. For instance, oysters are half price, but you can only order 1/2 dozen for every drink you order. Same for the chicken, I think it's a maximum of 3 pieces per drink (plenty for me). The chicken is quite good, but I didn't like that the dominant flavor for me was sugar.   Beer was really overpriced - their \"seasonal\" beers were $9 a pint. Really expected lower prices at happy hour, but I guess only their food is on the HH menu.   What I really disliked was the tiny paper plates and cheap plastic cutlery they give you to eat with. They could at least spring for some better quality disposable forks if they want to eliminate doing dishes. It was a joke trying to eat with the crappy ones they provide. And the napkins are the same ones they use in the bathroom. Maybe they're just going for a picnic vibe or something, but I didn't really care for it. If I'm in a restaurant paying $9 for a beer, I'd like a decent plate and a real fork to eat with.   The ambience is pretty cool, but is it ever loud in there!! As a group of six, we had an extremely difficult time trying to hold a conversation between more than two people, because we essentially had to shout across the table to be heard. Had we known this, I'm sure we would have chosen another venue for this particular outing.   Service was ok, but they don't really keep track of who is ordering what - for example, they count how many pieces of chicken were ordered at the table, not by the person. So they bring a plate of chicken to the table, and because it's so loud, we couldn't figure out who ordered what and when. Some people ended up not getting what they ordered or had to wait a super long time for their food because someone at the other end of the table thought it was their order.   Bottom line, I think this has to be your kind of place, and it's certainly not for everyone. I thought it was ok, but nothing about it would bring me back."}
{"text":"The nachos are incredible. 4 stars, based purely on the nachos, which is what I went for.   Major pass on the raw beef tostada . Fishy and tough. Had a bite and took a major pass."}
{"text":"Their specialty is fried chicken, $18 for 4 pieces plus a few slices of really damn good pickles. Nice vibes and trendy spot. Music was a bit too loud for my preference, but otherwise it's a great hangout spot/neighbourhood bar."}
{"text":"Small place, but service is great. This place though makes an amazing fried chicken...you cannot go wrong.  One of the best i have ever tasted!  And if you come during happy hour, the price can't be beat either!  Oysters are ok, and properly shucked as well.  Other than the entrance being a pain to find,  if you are looking for the best fried chicken in the city, do come here.  Not much more I can  say :)"}
{"text":"Bar Fancy is quite the mixed bag, pseudo-hidden on Queen a bit east of Ossington.  On my visit the absolute winner and total loser was the fried chicken.  When it finally came, the fried chicken was expertly breaded and cooked.  However, due to some problems with their fryer and subsequently forgetting our order (despite a few inquiries), the fried chicken came 1 hour and 15 minutes after we had ordered it.  Nothing is worth that kind of wait.  To make up for our incredibly delayed chicken, the bartender offered us a round of beers on the house, although in the end only one of them ended up comped, and we were too exhausted to argue.  Drinks are just way too expensive.  Beau's (not one of my favorite microbrews) is $9 per pint...wowza, we're approaching Air Canada centre prices.  The beef tartare was the strangest and least visually appealing beef tartare I've ever had, served on a greyish orange plate, slathered in a very heavy sauce, and topped with a sea of daikon.  If they were going to do something so non-traditional, the menu needs to include a description.  When one sees \"beef tartare\", one assumes that it will be hand-chopped beef, well-seasoned, and perhaps topped with an egg, this resembled that as much as I resemble Michael Jordan.    The ambience is definitely hipster: silly moustaches and wallet chains are almost a part of the dress code.  I think I only got in because I had a beard, a cute boyfriend, and two lesbians with me.  Overall, the visit had some major hiccups and the value was pretty bad.  If I come back, it will be for their happy hour special, which has $2 fried chicken pieces from 5-7 PM."}
{"text":"Bar Fancy is a hip, trendy spot on Queen across from the CAMH campus between Dovercourt and Ossington. (Go up the small alleyway then turn right to find the entrance.)  Fancy is fun and the service here is quite good. Within a limited space behind the bar, they manage to prepare some bar food and serve drinks. Prices are fairly standard.  I have tried several of the food options. The fried chicken is good for freshness and better than most fried chicken in Toronto. That being said, like much of Toronto's fried chicken serving places, it is a bit on the salty and greasy side.  The nachos are delicious and the cheesy bread is good as well. They have specials from 5-7 which are worth checking out.  They have a small list of white and red wines by the glass. The cab franc and the Hungarian sparkling wine are two of the best.  Definitely add this place to your list of places to try."}
{"text":"I had a been looking forward to trying Bar Fancy for a while and it didn't disappoint. The food was good and the beer was good. I could have used a little more beer selection and a few more cider options. The fried chicken and oysters were great! Perfect pre-movie or date spot!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The hot sauce is really flavourful with just the right amount of spice. We got the signature cocktail to start is was good but really pricey. Decent beer list but nothing special. Defiantly would go again, music was great to."}
{"text":"The reviews did not lie, this place has a side alley entrance, but the inside is normal restaurant. The drinks are definitely not what people are coming here for, though a tallboy of \"tiger beer\" is about $6. Staff is friendly, and unassuming, they're kind of there to do the things that need to get done, but don't really stand out all that much.   What really earns this place it's stars is the friend chicken. You get 3 pieces at $2 each during happy hour with the purchase of a drink. It is hot, fresh and delicious. The chicken is lightly coated with spices, while the inside is moist and juicy. It comes with their hot sauce and white mayo based sauce (kind of dill-y), that are both super tasty. This surprisingly did live up the my expectations and I would definitely go back for more friend chicken!"}
{"text":"2 stars for service and food. Overpriced, low quality and limited seating. Waiters didn't seem to care if you order a bunch of food but only half the table orders drinks. Only upside was the fried chicken itself but don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":"Hipster joint in the Queen west area, can be easily missed as there's no obvious sign besides the neon tiger hanging in the alley way. Keep following it and you'll find the entrance in the back. It's a small place, great for duos and small groups. Best seats are the window seats, which are even better in the summer when the front is just open to the street. Great for cocktails. Drinks are a little pricey but not outrageous compared to other Queen and Ossington prices. The fried chicken is delish, and I believe there may be a deal some point in the week where it's cheaper. Really great place if you're in the hipster neighborhood and looking for a bar to hang out in the evening!"}
{"text":"Such a cool little cocktail bar with an entrance hidden down an alley, and really friendly bartenders/servers who made me a delicious off-menu mocktail to brighten this preggo's night.  Dim, candlelit atmosphere with fun music and lively crowds made this a fun place to linger over drinks and CHICKEN!!  We had a bit of a chicken buffet, sharing both the numbing wings and a piece of fried chicken each.  The wings were exceptional if you like this sort of wing - totally dry, not saucy at all, with crisp skin and a serious numbing effect from Szechuan chili (or something just like it).  Not your average chicken wing and not for you if you don't like spicy food, especially this uncommon kind of spicy food, but we thought they were addictive and refreshingly different.  The fried chicken itself was also piping hot and juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside - it's a no-brainer as to why they are known for their chicken here.  Highly recommended for a late night drink and a chicken snack, this was a really fun and random find!"}
{"text":"Definitely my kind of spot, I in town for my birthday from the States and was just walking by looking for something to get into. And my lady and looked at each other with the same face that said \"if you go I go\" so we did and it was worth it. So if your looking for a spot with a cool ass vibe hip hop infused music and some good bar food this is a must go to place in Toronto. And the only reason I hit them with 4 stars is because my drink (Dark & stormy) it needed a little work. But with the two fish sandwiches and nachos and spicy salad. My mind wasn't focused on that drink. And thanks Jessie for my Birthday shots me gave us. (You can never go wrong with a shot of something)"}
{"text":"Aside from this place being a \"I'm to cool for school, but like not really cause cool isn't something you should aspire to and I'm just like so me and chill,\" kind of place, the food was pretty good and the service wasn't bad at all.   After walking past it a couple of times because there is no actual sign out front (you know cause like, labels suck), we found Bar Fancy simply because I noticed some people eating chicken from a half covered window. Once we got in through small corridor to the hidden entrance, we found the place jam packed. Not all of our party had arrived but the staff were super helpful in finding extra chairs for what was originally a two person table. Having missed happy hour, we still wanted to try the fried chicken and ordered two meals between four people. Each meal came with four pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of wonder bread and pickles. I have to admit, my experience with fried chicken is limited to Popeyes, WOW chicken (in Calgary) and some local places in New Orleans so I can't claim to know much about fried chicken, but wow, was this chicken delicious! It was seasoned perfectly and fried just right. If the lights were brighter I would probably see the grease dripping down my fingers but in the dark, it didn't taste or feel greasy. I'm not too sure on the wonder bread, but I guess it helped to soak up some of the grease? In any case, the chicken was fantastic and I can just imagine how easy it would be to eat more pieces during happy hour.   Definitely a go back kind of place for the chicken. I couldn't see myself hanging out here for long since it is pretty crowded, space is tight and it's too loud to have a conversation, but when the hankering for fried chicken comes, Bar Fancy is the place to go."}
{"text":"Fried chicken = delish! Beef carpaccio = amazing! I've had 2 different kinds of dips which were great. Fish sandwich also great. Service is good but not overwhelming. Recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"We went to Bar Fancy to try the fried chicken every one raves about. It wasn't worth the trip. The fries were also sub-par. Definitely not worth going here for food. If you're going for drinks, okay. Overall, it's a dive bar with fancy bar prices."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Bar Fancy, which is in our 'hood.  I took advantage of the Fancy Hour special and got chicken pieces (just $2 a piece from 5pm to 7pm).  I've had it there before and enjoyed it.  It was really tender and juicy! The coating was yummy. There were spices (salt? cinnamon? sugar? cardamon?) sprinkled on afterwards.  I had a couple glasses of white wine.  The first glass served by one guy was a bit low (especially for $11).  The second glass served by someone else was more reasonable and generous."}
{"text":"did not like...food was v disappointing...oysters were smelly and not very cold.  reminded me of the food at El Furniture Warehouse, but more expensive."}
{"text":"I don't know what this bar is, or how this is a bar.. but it sucks. The food menu is not okay at all."}
{"text":"Been here three times and all of them were pretty good. The fried chicken and nachos are staples. The fried chicken is seasoned well and very crispy. They have a happy hour special for $2 a piece with a alcoholic drink order (3 piece max per drink order).   Place itself is not fancy and is really just a bar with some bar food. Somewhat awkward entrance where you have to take a few steps down an alley. They also have very strict occupancy rules. However, they're very nice about letting you hold seats for friends who are on their way."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, chill crowd, great decor, delicious drinks, and the best fried chicken! Only thing that bugged me a little was the insanely loud music, but I could've been seated in the wrong spot. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken here is too bomb.  Go. Trust me. Go.  I came because I heard rumours that this place had fried chicken that was to die for. I came here with a friend and it was amazing. The portion was satisfying and the beers on tap were great.   I brought my husband here because our original restaurant was booked for an event and my husband had his heart on fried chicken for his birthday. This place was such a hit for him and I look like the coolest wife and Now he can't wait to go back.  The place is cozy so it's better to come in twos but you can squeeze a group of 4.  Go!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool Queen St spot. We originally were planning on heading somewhere else, but the long lineup forced me to remember I've been wanting to pop into Bar Fancy for quite some time. Didn't run down the full menu, but we ended up with some tasty warm olives, a few cocktails, the dirty nachos and some fried chicken. Everything was great, and the chicken was a true standout. Very unique crust, not at all greasy, and super tender. My only real quam was that service wasn't that great, which is kind of a shame. Anyway, I'd return for a beer and give them a second go on the service, it was Friday and it was pretty rammed."}
{"text":"This place is POPPIN'! We were at a bar across the street and their kitchen was closing. The waiter recommended coming here for fried chicken (you know a place is good if a waiter at a different restaurant recommends it - or maybe that's just how nice Canadians are). No regrets!   It was hard to find (go through the alley that looks like it goes nowhere and follow the sound til you get to a crowded bar)! We couldn't find signs for it anywhere and that's kinda the point. Even their menus don't have the name of the place on them.  We got the pickles appetizer which was literally just cut up pickles with ranch. I was kinda hoping for fried pickles or something more worth the money. Probably would've cost me the same to just get a jar of pickles. Don't get those (unless you're craving just plain pickle spears). DO, however, get their chicken. It's what they're known for and for good reason! Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. I went here with 2 friends and we all agreed. I can't remember how this happened, but they gave us free fries (I vaguely remember them making one too many orders or something), so service was on point too! Our waiters were very friendly and made recommendations for drinks, too.  They also played a great variety of music that literally got the whole bar singing and making friends with strangers. An awesome Canadian experience I'll never forget!"}
{"text":"Their cocktails are amazing and reasonably priced ($10 - $14 a pop) and the fried chicken truly is a treat before 7pm at $2 a piece."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try the infamous chicken here but I was able to locate it for a quick brew. My gf and I was recommeneded we stop here during our time in Toronto. I grabbed a Woodhouse that seemed to be on everybody's table and the lady got a whiskey sour.   The place was packed. Could barely walk, we were able to find a spot at the bar after some shuffling. The smell of chicken grease in the air and music pumping. I will say this place lives up to the name with such prices, I could see myself enjoying it more right before the nightlife hour strikes. Two thumbs up over here."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in the city and even better then some of the top fried chicken spots in Charleston and Detroit. Highly recommend this dish !"}
{"text":"Based on what I was seeking, this place gets two thumbs up.  Fried chicken and more fried chicken.  A little concerned that the kitchen wouldn't be open late (Saturday 11pm) we were relieved to discover otherwise. There's just something naughty about eating fried chicken at that hour (at least for me). It tasted awesome and perfect for sharing b/w two.  The bartender whipped up a custom cocktail based on my inputs: gin, lime, soda, prosecco. Turns out it's a pre-existing drink (French 75).  Plan to go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"A hidden bar/foodie spot near Ossington and Queen. The big black front door is literally on a side alley.   The space is cozy, probably holds no more than 40 people sitting but it's nice. The atmosphere is hip, trendy and mature (late 20's up to mid 30's). Locals come here for the fried chicken. It's perfectly spiced and some of the best fried chicken I've had - ever! The skin was peppery flavoured and the lime juice made it perfect.  Pro tip: happy hour is before 7 pm. $2 per piece of fried chicken. Order 3 pieces for a snack, 4 or more for a \"meal\".  Drinks are OK, nothing special. The reason for the 4 stars is for venue and food. The menu looks standard with nothing too special. It was fun trying to find where the entrance is, but may be confusing if you're drunk.  -Trendy and fresh. Come for the KFC and a pint."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were walking the street and noticed a dimly lit bar that looked kinda cool, so we stepped in. I think I should mention that we aren't locals, and were going to be in TO for just this one evening, which we decided to spend bar hopping! we walked in to this comfy little bar, and since I wasn't sure about what I wanted to drink - I told the bartender what flavors I like and asked him to make me something of his choice. He was right on. the cocktail he made me was delicious. We tried another one of his concoctions, but didn't indulge in any of their dishes - though I will say that the fried chicken looked delicious. The bar is quite small and was busy for a late Wednesday night, but we were able to find a couple seats at the bar. Bar Fancy is a neat, unpretentious, intimate spot and definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Pros: Staff are generally quite great, the atmosphere is awesome, music is top notch, drinks are DOPE, highly suggest the rose hibiscus from DDC, its the main reason i come from the east end to this place. its also a nice reprieve from the usual mediocrity of queen west.  Cons: where this place really faults is the menu. A welcoming one, executed with such disdain to senses like taste, its abominable. I've ordered food here on 3 occasions and each time its been horrific. Chicken wings are disgusting; perfectly cooked, juicy, and then, marinated in a sort of vomit-inducing sauce that you wouldnt serve your worst enemy. Beef tartare on tostada; take a decent cut of raw meat, chop it well, then marinate it in puke sauce and serve it on a crispy tostada, an excellent example of a great idea executed with such malice , one wonders if its just all a big farce.  On the plus side you are in earshot of sweet olenka's where any number of desserts wash the foul taste from your mouth. highly suggest ice cream sandwich.  On the plus side the olives are a great portion and taste just like olives."}
{"text":"That hot sauce made in house is spicy and wicked. Please proceed with care.  Happy Hour Special on a weekday is worth coming to enjoy those tasty fried chicken at $2 a piece per drink order from 5 pm to 7 pm. So juicy and crispy.  Bar Fancy is nothing fancy. It has this speakeasy feel. The entrance is at the back after you walk through a little alleyway. It was kind of dark but the Tiger Beer sign would lead the way.  Interior is dark. Music is loud. Does remind me of some bars in Thailand...."}
{"text":"Environment is trendy, but gets very noisy. Food wise, the happy hour 5~7 half price oyster is not bad. The fried chicken and wings are delicious, although I prefer them to be less sweet. Nachos is so so. Service is good, but 18% as a minimum choice on machine is not right to me. 35 dollars per guy should be rated more than 2 dollar sign for this place."}
{"text":"Two words: Fried chicken. I will forever be dreaming about this fried chicken and holding all other fried chickens to this standard. Not even exaggerating, I would build a shrine to this chicken and pray to it every day. I don't know what they put in there - some kind of alluring concoction of spices and crack, but it is MAGICAL... all these wonderful flavours bursting in your mouth, I don't even know... sweet, salty, tangy, this is like everything. Plus each piece of chicken is decently large, (the actual chicken, not because it's coated in 12 layers of batter), super moist and juicy and tender. I've been here twice to take advantage of their happy hour menu (between 5-7 PM) where you can get chicken for $2/piece and half price oysters. I also had a fish sandwich here once and it was also A+ quality, although not quite at the level of the chicken.  The name is a bit misleading, because Bar Fancy is not fancy in the least, and to get inside you actually have to go down this little alleyway and enter from the back. But the place has character, and is a very cool, low-key place to chill at whilst enjoying your chicken. They have a small selection of beers and a delicious rose hibiscus beer here.  CHICKEN!!!!!!!!!!! Go and get it, your life will be forever changed."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. I don't care for the atmosphere that much. But hands down amazing fried chicken. The staff is fun and great."}
{"text":"I love this place, it was one night when we were bar hopping. We could not find a place and finally this place. It has a really private entrance so you can definitely miss it. But over all we had an amazing time."}
{"text":"Service: The staff is friendly and quick on taking your order. They are quite efficient as the kitchen is situated right in bar, where the bar staff have to multi-task in serving you food/drinks.  Ambiance: Small and cozy place. Great for a small party between 2-4 people. The place is definitely hidden, as there's no front entrance, sign, or number outside the restaurant. I walk passed it a few times before finding it. You have too look for the neon tiger head lights in a dark alley way. The entrance to the place is at the side.  Food: The have a few selection of craft beers, which is reasonably price. But the best time to come is during their happy hour from 6-8pm for their $2 fried chicken and $2 oysters. The fried chicken is cooked till perfection, where the skin and crispy and the meat is still moist. They also put this cajun/cinnamon seasoning to it that add depths to its flavour. For $2 you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 5-7pm! $2 per piece of fried chicken and a half dozen oysters for $8. No drink specials though.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The oysters were good but got some bits of shell, so it wasn't shucked perfectly.  Wine is $10 and up."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always a great vibe and the FC never disappoints! Don't forget the hot sauce"}
{"text":"You're fancy, huh?   Bar Fancy has good cocktails and a hidden alley entrance, but is still best known for their happy hour fried chicken. There's a good reason for this, this is some legit fry fry chicky chick. Is it a touch of cinnamon or maple? Something makes it a little sweet, but still a solid savoury treat.   If you're hoping to get the $2 deal on chicken to go, we don't blame you, but know it's a no-go. That superb deal is reserved for in-house drinkers. This being said, a meal comes with bread, ranch, pickles and four pieces of the good stuff. A decent picnic for two."}
