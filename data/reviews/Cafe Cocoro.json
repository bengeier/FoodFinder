{"text":"I was so excited to see a new coffee shop/Korean cafe open in the neighbourhood and had to give it a try. My husband and I ordered the bulgogi, kimchi and semolina cake. Bulgogi was tasty, but not the best in the area (IMO the best bulgogi in the area is at Yanagi); the kimchi was a bit bland; and the semolina cake was pretty good.   The cafe is very nice and the owner is super friendly. We will be back and will try more of the menu next time!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a ordered the Bulgogi . It was so tasty and I was so hungry I did not stop to take a photo. For dessert I had a coffee and a Bahamian (I think) version of pain-perdu, or Spanish budding , or like Martin B. Review shows banana bread but much lighter with coconut. I think it's their special bar. It is worth trying and reordering next time I'm close by.  I think I spoke with the owner she was really pleasant and her café is very efficient, clean , well lit and decorated. The staff were also very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Popped in here while exploring the neighbourhood and was met by the lovely owner who was extremely welcoming. Most of the food is made in house, including the bagels, with the exception of some of the pastries which are brought in. We sampled two of the butter tarts (not made in-house) and they were delicious. We also took some Korean Beef Gyoza to go, and enjoyed that very much. We will definitely be back to sample the rest!"}
{"text":"Small, cute cafe with really nice baristas! This place serves not just coffee, but a wide variety of pastries, breakfast foods like bagels, Korean side dishes (I saw some kimchi containers), and even lunch. Service was very friendly and warm - I stood there for quite a while trying to decide which dessert I wanted, and the woman behind the counter just smiled at me patiently the whole time.   Coffee was good and prices are reasonable. Also really liked the plants by the window and the overall decor :)  Only potential negative is the lack of sufficient seating - I went on a non-busy afternoon and got the last available spot. Even so, I think I will be back to try their food menu if I ever get the chance to be in the area."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, Cocoro is a real gem!  A coffee shop, they also serve up delicious Korean dishes and gelato.  Everything goes here: stop in for a coffee and dessert while studying, a coffee to go, lunch with friends, a smoothie for that afternoon burst of energy.    The Korean dishes were really tasty, especially when compared to the standard cafe fare of sandwiches and salads.  I had the bibimbap, and while no, it wasn't served in the traditional clay bowl, it was still really good!  When we first came in and were deciding on lunch my son became enamoured by the cupcakes on display.  We told him if he behaved and ate his lunch, we'd buy him a cupcake.  That was a great incentive, so sure enough I kept my word and bought him a cupcake (and it was an excuse to get coffee for myself).  I managed to sneak a bite of the cupcake: delicious!  The coffee was really good too.  The place is really welcoming.  Everyone working was friendly and courteous.  When we came in there was a table with a few adults and a bunch of kids, and our group had two kids.  They had books and toys stashed on one of the benches, that were really appreciated by our kiddos."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The owner is incredibly friendly and the coffee is always fresh.  It's a great place to grab a quick bagel with a coffee, or try one of the menu items.  Apart from one stale baked good, I've had many fantastic experiences at Café Cocoro."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Cocoro! The Korean food and coffee are both fresh and delicious. Today we tried the strawberries and cream gelato and it rocked! And best of all, the owner, Daisy, is lovely!"}
{"text":"I went here around 2:00pm on a weekday, so it wasn't very busy. The space is bright, clean, and there are large tables where you can work.   The barista was in training, but very nice. Staff seem to be ESL, but that wasn't a barrier to service, as they could communicate effectively and were very kind.   Their special bar is amazing! It's this coconut bar that is so moist, fluffy, and almost creamy at the same time. It made me think of banana bread, but different. It's definitely worth trying. The Americano was standard flare.  They don't advertise their WIFI password, but the staff put it directly in my phone for me - a little different,  but I got connected. The music is quite loud, so It's not ideal for a work space, and moms with bucket loads of kids kept coming in. I almost want to say it's a young white mom hot spot, but hopefully that was only due to the time of day.    It's one of a few new coffee places that seem to be opening up in the area, which is nice because this area is lacking in them."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh, local and friendly...all you could ask for in our increasingly hip hood!"}
{"text":"Very nice new café in the area that specializes in the usual baked good but also some excellent Korean dishes. We had the Korean pancake for the kid, and the vegetarian Bibembop for us. All very good, but my wife noted that the dish was served in a regular bowl as opposed to a more traditional heated stone pot which helps to crisp up the rice. It was still good though. Coffee and cookies were tasty and fresh. The place is bright and spacious and very welcoming. Daisy the owner is very nice and helpful. We will go back."}
{"text":"A great mix of everything I love : strong coffee , awesome desserts , Korean food and a very friendly atmosphere. A gem of a coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place but unfortunately I am not a fan!  I was excited to try the place and was finally in the neighbourhood! I arrived and immediately felt welcoming. Small-ish place but not tiny for a coffee shop. I was really craving for a latte but I had to seal the deal when I saw affogato on the menu. It was 12 degrees and Id love me some gelato!! So I ordered the affogato, but the girl at the bar looked super confused. I repeated myself but she had no idea what I was talking about. I was super embarassaed so I pointed to the word \"affogato\" on the board, then she told me she is new and doesn't know what that is. Welp.  I got my regular latte with almond milk. I paid in cash and when she gave me back my change, I accidentally dropped the coins into the coffee cup. WELP AGAIN! She was actually super nice and offered to make me a new cup. I gotta give her 5 star for that - nowadays people are dinky cheap to the point they would rather lose a customer and focus on short term profits.  I got my latte and was very dissappointed...i barely taste any caffeine, and it was not the almond milk that overwhelmed it. It just tasted like watered down espresso with almond milk. I tossed it after 2 sips."}
{"text":"Cafe Coroco is a local coffee shop. The decor is very nice.  They serve many types of desert along with gelato ice cream. They also have sandwiches.   Good coffee with delicious marble cheesecake brownie. Very friendly staff.  Unfortunately no wifi available in the cafe."}
{"text":"If I'm not mistaken Cafe Cocoro opened a couple years ago and my wife and I really love this place. Although some of the food they serve is not home made and provided by a separate supplier, some of their food, and their hot beverages are just downright great. We love the atmosphere, the decor, and Daisy (who I think is the owner) is always friendly. This a great Cafe with some interesting and tasty Korean dishes. I personally really enjoy the sweet, soft and delicious taste of Korean pancakes, along with their lattes."}
{"text":"A happy surprise to find this little gem on the Danforth!! Wonderfully pleasant staff and the most delicious food (made hot and fresh!) for great prices. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This cute scenic place is quite quaint and the atmosphere is supremely pleasant. The staff is lovely and food is excellent. I had a dopio espresso with a walnut butter tart and it was 10/10. Just delicious."}
{"text":"We've been coming here religiously since it opened and can highly recommend. The Korean food options are exceptional with a solid coffee and treat offering as well. Family run and that's definitely the vibe, with friendly personal service always. And good value. What else can you ask for?"}
