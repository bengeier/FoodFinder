{"text":"Very good food, friendly staff, delicious coffee. For trucks, there's plenty of parking right across the street from this place."}
{"text":"Okay so the place is not that pretty but let's go inside and check out the food.  Ordered Pho some appetizers and the Sauteed Pork Ribs with Homemade sauce.  Everything was delicious.  This was a pleasant surprise.  If you like Vietnamese food I highly recommend Pho Vn Vietnamese Cuisine."}
{"text":"What else can I say?  This is a true hidden gem.  The Pho is unbelievable. The best I've had.  And it was a big bowl for only $7!  Come here.  Eat here.  Enjoy it.  Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I have been to a hand full of Pho restaurants over the past few years, a couple several times, and some very popular joints,  but this place has made an impression.  I usually get the standard beef broth soup with beef shaved thin. Don't go much for tendon or tripe, I guess it's what I'm used to.  So I ordered the usual, and was pleasantly surprised. This place has the best beef broth, flavored with a hint of star anise.  I didn't even touch the Hoisin of soy sauce to bump it up a notch as I usually do.  Very fresh herbs were given to both diner's, not having to share the herbs with others as some places give only one plate of the greens for two. The place is clean but simple decor, the server was friendly but was unable to converse in English beyond food orders. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Egg rolls didnt taste fresh.... the pho soup had a little bit of sweetness... It was okay but it wasnt my taste!"}
{"text":"Great Pho! The wife and I were looking for a good place to try some Pho and stumbled across this place through yelp. We usually go to a different restaurant for Pho but our spot was closed today. Glad we found this place! We ordered beef and chicken Pho for takeout. Now I can't decide which place is better but, I know for sure you cannot go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"No ambience but one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town.  Got a simple dish of noodles, fried chicken pieces, over a bed of fresh raw vegetables with a light dressing that was very fresh & summery.  Best spring rolls I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just started getting into Pho and this place is great! Fair price, and amazing taste. Will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"The pho is delicious! I had a shrimp pho and the flavor was amazing! This is an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. The customer service here was pretty awesome as well. We had a group of 5 and a baby and the lady that took care of us was awesome. She was kind, respectful, and smiling. My sisters ordered Thai tea but it was bottled Thai tea, so they were bummed. The temperature inside of the restaurant was warmer and a bit stuffy. Still, I would stop by and eat here again because not only did I enjoy delicious meal, I experienced a pleasant time with my family!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING IS MICROWAVED! Rancid peanuts, frozen bloody tasking chicken and tons of water at the bottom of my bowl! I will NOT come back! YUCK! I also have a chemical headache. Like the kind u get from bad Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Delish. First time trying phone and I loved and and ordered a boba smoothie also super yummy"}
{"text":"I really like Vietnamese cuisine and come from MN where we have the largest number of Vietnamese restaurants in the country (according to the NY Times) and the best (according to Anthony Bourdain).    My two Asian food passions are pho and good dim sum. Neither are particularly good here in the valley. In both cases I have tried over a dozen restaurants. I found myself in this strip mall restaurant today due to another place mysteriously being closed on a random day - another habit shared too often around here.   I wanted to like this place. The vibe is good the place is very clean.  The menu is fine. There were very few Asians inside. Mostly older white guys - a warning sign!  The service was very good. Nice attentive guy running his butt off.   I just ordered a bowl of pho. Nothing fancy. They were very generous with the noodles and the brisket and sliced rare steak. Encouraging. I like the Phoenix habit of serving mint leaves with the other fresh seasonings. However, I found the broth bland.  I added all the jalapeños provided and still nothing jumped out at me. I ate every bite, but won't be back.  Too far and too little for the drive. Not bad at all, just not stellar."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy that there is now a Pho/Viet place by my office now. The pho I got (rare steak) was pretty good, I thought. They also give you plenty of extras like the Thai basil and sprouts. I thought the portion was good, and there was plenty of meat in mine. The inside of this restaurant is nothing special, but the food they put out is pretty good. Also the woman (I am assuming wife of the cook/owner) is also very nice."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Fresh and delicious. Close to Moon Valley too! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yum! The spring rolls are fantastic..so fresh! Also, the chicken pho is do die for! Our server/ cook was very friendly and always had a smile.  Also, the restaurant is very spacious and clean. Will go again!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in North Phoenix! Tried Pho VN for the first time tonight and it was definitely a pleasant surprise. I had the Pho Tai. The broth was perfectly flavored; not too salty but not too bland either. They are very generous with the rice noodles but if you're a big fan of the beef, you may want to ask for extra because that portioning wasn't quite as generous as the noodles. Although this small restaurant is located in a pretty desolate strip mall on Thunderbird and 19th Ave, their food definitely won't disappoint. I was actually surprised by how few people there were dining in the restaurant since they've been open for about 5 months according to the owner. Don't be afraid of the plain Jane décor inside, the food is far from plain. Awesome authentic flavors and super quick service..all around a very positive experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to grab some Bun for lunch (and a cafe sua da)!  Plenty to eat, and the iced coffee was good, too."}
{"text":"This is a great Pho restaurant! I took a friend who had never tried Vietnamese before and even she loved it! We both had pho. I had the beef meatballs and she had the chicken. Both were fantastic! Everything was fresh and hot and homemade. The service was fast and friendly. The prices are great."}
{"text":"If you live in the area and like Vietnamese food you need to go to this place. Everything was fresh and delicious, portions were large and price is good."}
{"text":"Pho was delicious and so were the spring rolls, fresh! Service was great and definitely will come back again. Prices are reasonable than most places. I ordered pho, springs rolls, and chicken over rice and bill was under $20. Everything we had was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent flavors!  Good prices. Much better than the Pho on Carefree Highway!"}
{"text":"Pho broth was good but very disappointed in the very small amount of sliced beef that was in it. Will try again because it's close and local."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food at this husband and wife restaurant.  Have never had a bad meal here!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pho Ga! Nice, clean and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone. Owner comes over and greats everyone. What a find."}
{"text":"The Pho is amazing. The broth very tasty with a lot of noodles. I had chicken pho which was very seasoned. The egg roll was delicious. restaurant was very clean. All the items you would need to eat with, sauces, were already on the table that was great for me. I will return to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the soft shrimp egg noodle and it was mouthwatering-ly delicious. I also had a taste of the Pho and wanted to keep eating it especially since the broth was so flavorful. The customer service was also efficient. The owner was really sweet. Pho Vn is the type of restaurant that gives hole-in-the-wall restaurants a good reputation. Stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered beef pho. The broth was clean and not oily and just refreshing. One of the best broth I've had in a while. They didn't skimp on the protein. The owners are so nice and friendly. Definitely a new go to place to go."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to get PHO GA !!  You found the right place just for the best of Vietnamese food ...  I really recommend this restaurant ... I hope you all enjoy this place as much as I do .."}
{"text":"Have been craving pho for a while and found this gen. The broth was very good, although I would say it could use more tripe and tendon. Think I had one of each. I would gladly pay a little more for some extra tendon. Will be back again though"}
{"text":"Great pho place! The lady who was there at lunch showed me a new way to mix my sauces and dip my beef. The broth is delicious and has some really great, subtle flavors. The temperature of the food and the place were perfect. Also, the whole restaurant was very clean and bright. The service was good and fast. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"The food is great!!! If you're looking for a romantic cozy atmosphere to eat this prob isn't the place for you, but if your looking for great Pho then I def recommend this lil ol place!!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I were very excited to try this new pho place not far from the hood. We got it as take-out. I tried the rare beef and meatballs, the hubs went straight rare beef. While the meatballs were great, the beef seemed like it had been cooked before going into the broth (could not confirm because the meat came in the broth already). The summer rolls were pretty par but i was disappointed by the broth. Much less flavorful than i would have hoped for. I'd give them another shot but i'd probably continue to go there in a pinch."}
{"text":"Not a place to go if you are looking for atmosphere. I was also concerned at how incredibly dusty and dirty the fan blades were on each fan. Would the food be dirty? We are here last night and ordered Rare beef Pho, shrimp spring rolls, and 2 noodle dishes. I usually dine at a Vietnamese place up on 19th/Camelback which I much prefer. The chicken in my noodle dish tasted strange- I stopped eating it and haven't been ill. The Pho was good, could use a little more flavor in the broth. Spring rolls were a disappointment- not enough mint inside and shrimp was \"shrimpy\" in taste and smell. Would not eat anything else but the Pho. We chatted with the owners prior to taking our food to go, they were very nice."}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews, but this was the worst rice noodle bowl I've ever had. One piece of shrimp, one eggroll, almost entirely a box of noodles with a dab of meat in the middle, and very little else. I treated friends here and was terribly embarrassed. Avoid."}
{"text":"The PHO was amazing. Service was great and very quick l, and the broth was rich and delicious. The only negative was my 'rare beef' was medium well. I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"went with a buddy & I love this place. I had the chicken pho bowl and it's fantastic. Best Pho I've had yet. I tried the ginger beef and though I normally do not like  ginger, it wasn't overpowering and the dish was delicious. thank you. We'll be back with the kids."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place out but ended up being disappointed and will not be coming back. Their eggs rolls tasted old, the oil they fried it in tasted like fish, and the chicken seemed like it was raw. Worst fried eggs rolls I've ever had. Ordered Pho Thai, it was ok. The steak was just ok, and the soup was oily. There are a ton of Pho places, wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking in the strip mall.  We were the only customers and were slightly nervous.  We were greeted and offered any seat in the very clean place.  We both ordered #14, vermicelli with beef , chicken, shrimp, egg rolls, bean sprouts and cucumbers.  The food came quickly and the bowl was large in size.  All the ingredients were fresh and yummy.  We took some home.  Nice staff and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First visit and the food is awesome.  I had the Curry with Tofu and my wife had Coconut Milk with Chicken. Both were great.   We also had Thai Tea. It was bottled but tasty. However, not as good as the meal.   Looking forward to a second visit."}
{"text":"The Pho Ga is just what I wanted. I prefer extra veggies just because I like a lot of veggies in my Pho. The woman cooking and serving was very pleasant. The restaurant is basic but super clean. If you like Pho, you'll enjoy your meal here."}
{"text":"So mad I didn't try this place out sooner! I was only able to come here just once right before I moved back to Nevada. I lived close to this restaurant and passed it several times a week and always told myself that I needed to check it out.   This place is located on W. Thunderbird road and 19th in a small shopping center. The shopping center always seems kind of sketchy even though it's on a major road. There are always people just hanging out and look as though they want to rob you!! Probably part of the reason I was reluctant to come here alone.   Outside of that, the restaurant itself is large inside, but the kitchen area can be easily seen from the seating area as the wall dividing the dining area and the kitchen is a short wall maybe 4 feet tall and it goes the whole length of the place on the right side.   As I entered there was only one other table occupied, so I wasn't sure if this was a good place to come to eat or not. I expected many more people here during lunchtime. Anyways the one older lady working called out for me to seat myself where ever I wanted. After I chose a table close to the entrance, the lady brought me a menu and a glass of water. Their menu is large with lots to choose from. I decided on the Spring rolls with the peanut sauce and Soft egg noodles with shrimp.   As I waited around for my food to come out, several other people came in. One for takeout and the other dined in. I'm still thinking to myself \"why isn't this place busier?\". My Spring rolls came out first within a few minutes. I'm pretty sure they were frozen and microwaved, but they still were surprisingly tasty. I wasn't a fan of the sauce though. My noodles came out shortly after that and the serving size was huge!! It could easily be shared between two people. The veggies and shrimp were well cooked and seasoned. They weren't overcooked and the veggies still had a crispy bite to them. I only ate a portion of it and had to take the rest home.   The lady came around often to her few customers and filled up drinks and to take away dirty dishes. She brought checks out quickly and gladly gave people to-go boxes/bags for their food.   Even though the look of the place isn't all that inviting to me, the food was delicious and reasonably priced. If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Glad there is a pho place closer to us now. It's decent and if you are craving last minute this is your place. Would I compare this to the top places in town...no. Is this place bad? No The pho broth I wish was more flavorful. It really didn't have what it takes to move it over to a 4 star.  The spring rolls were good.  The vermicelli/buhn(I think that's what it's called) dish was good but lacking in presentation.   I'd be back to scratch an itch but not cure it. If that makes sense."}
{"text":"Very good and large portions! I wish more people came here so they could experience pho greatness! My daughter and I both had huge bowls of pho ga and my son Had a combination pho. My husband has the chili shrimp ( the only non pho order in our crew). The nights are getting cool, but the pho is hot... so come down to Pho Vn."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as it is very close to home but I would go further to get something better.  The restaurant is very bare bones and unattractive.  The owner is very nice and friendly.  There was one person in addition to the owner whom I guess is his wife. I ordered the Pho Ga and it was a decent bowl of soup yet the chicken was overcooked and flavorless. We also tried a main dish which I cannot remember the name of, it had mushrooms and broccoli and chicken which was also very overcooked. We most likely will not return for in house dining, possibly get take out Pho in a pinch."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pho. I can eat pho everyday, in fact, I've ate pho 1 week straight before. That's how much I love pho. The love of first sight, started when my Vietnamese best friend introduced me to the dish. I'm hooked ever since. So, I'd like to say, I can differentiate types of pho... and this, by far is my least favorite. I can't taste any broth ... watery. You could tell right away before you even spin on the soup... I wouldn't call this a \"pho\""}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last month and forgot to leave a review. Food and service is great! We ordered the springs rolls which were delicious with yummy peanut sauce. And had the pho thai which was great. We went when the place was not very busy and my toddler is a flirt and charmed the cook and waitress lol. They loaded him up with goodies. Fun ending to a delicious meal - we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I probably wont be back. The girl acted afraid yet the older gentleman was very pleasant, both nice even though she was timid and I am always very polite so this wasn't a one off issue. The food, well, the Shrimps salad should be removed from the menu. I ordered a #2 shrimps & pork spring rolls, #3, BBQ pork spring rolls (she told me they no longer make/sell #3) and #4 Shrimps salad. The salad was full of cucumber, no where in the description was cucumber posted but herbs and carrots were listed and there was none. Just shredded lettuce, sprouts, shrimps and FTW...CUCUMBERS! lol. I hate cucumbers! They were in the spring rolls too...super frustrating since I will not eat them. Tons of vermicelli noodles, too many cucumbers and while the shrimps and pork were great, the dish has more than that and the main role of the rolls was not abundant enough to make up for the excessive quantity of noodles and cucumbers. How they no longer sell the #3 pork rolls is baffling to me since the pork in the #2 roll could have been used and was the shining ingredient and reason why three stars is necessary versus one. Oh, and I asked for sambal and sriracha...got neither :("}
{"text":"Not the best pho I've ever had but very good. I will be back. I love that they are less than 5 minutes away from my office. Husband and wife cooks. Open parking lot. The seating is booths and chairs. It wasn't that long of a wait for my pho. I ordered the rare beef."}
{"text":"I had the chance to check out this new spot today, and it was pretty good. As others have stated, it is really nice to have a good Pho/Vietnamese restaurant in my area. While I didn't have the Pho, I will be back to try it. I ordered the #1, fried veggie egg rolls and they were exceptional! I also had the #14, rice vermicelli noodles, with beef chicken, egg roll, and 2 shrimp. I also had a Thai iced tea,  which came in a bottle, but tasted good. The egg rolls also came with lettuce, cilantro and mint that were very fresh and yummy. Although I didn't really care for the fish sauce, I had some at home that went well with this meal. All in all,  I will DEFINITELY be putting this restaurant into my rotation."}
{"text":"The broth is nice simple refreshing and clean. Hard to find good Vietnamese food places here. They give you a good amount of protein. The owners are nice and welcoming. I had chicken pho and it was very good!"}
{"text":"Pho has great flavor but is also very inexpensive.  No ambiance here, FYI - but I think they just opened and are still decorating.  They were very accommodating to a special request of my date as well.  Will definitely be back for more of this Pho!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  I had the combo fried rice and some Chicken Pho.  Both were very good. The rice was not too oily and the seasonings they used were quite tasty. The Pho was not too salty and tasted very fresh.  Since this place is so close to home, I'll have to make it back to try some more."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place ever! They were previously located on 32nd st and Greenway by the food city. They moved locations so suddenly and we were so upset that they were gone. We tried a ton a different phos trying to find a new spot but we didn't find any that compared. We finally landed here and were beyond excited to see some familiar faces! Still the same great taste and they added egg rolls to their menu! Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"Delicious mom&pop spot. We strictly go here only for their Phô. But some have tried their Shrimp Curry and that is good as well. Very simple and delicious little spot. Bussiest times are for lunch and sometimes dinner. I have taken all of my friends here, my 10 year old and family...everyone loves it."}
{"text":"I love Pho so naturally I was excited to have a Pho place open up within 5 minutes of where I live. And last night I was finally able to stop in and try it. Upon walking in I was a but taken back. They must has just had a dinner rush that came through because there was tables unbiased. But there was just two people working  (I'm guessing husband/wife) so it's understandable. Plus I don't really care what the place looks like as long as it has good food and I don't see any critters running around.  Speaking of food. I got the easy rare pho. The broth was pretty beefy tasting, came with less noodles than I was use to as well. After fixing it up with all the side veggies and some siracha, tastes perfect!  The lady was very quick to refill out drinks as well. Prices are average and about what you would expect from other pho places. All in all I thought this place was pretty good. Just be prepared that there is nothing fancy about this place...yet. they did just open so lack of decoration is to be expected."}
{"text":"Really good flavor.  Got the rare beef pho, delish!  Very fair pricing.  Very clean.  Super nice waitress and quick.  Glad to have found this gem.  Definitely am going back"}
{"text":"Amazing pho, friendly service, and good prices! I highly recommend! I had no idea that this restaurant was nearby my house so I am so happy that I found it. My son is a very picky eater and he loved the Chicken Pho Soup!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap, clean, and yummy! I didn't order Pho, but I did have an egg noodle stir fry w shrimp. (Sorry I don't remember the name). It was 7.95, came in a large serving and was delicious.  Staff was very nice and refilled our drinks repeatedly without requiring a request."}
{"text":"Had the rare beef Pho and the S[ring Rolls like always. It was good solid Pho with all the fresh fixins for a very reasonable price. The Spring roll was ok"}
{"text":"I just moved nearby and was happy to see a pho place within walking distance. I have only gotten the egg rolls and chicken pho but they were yummy and filling. Good portion sizes and good service too. It seems they make everything right when u order so you wait about 15 min to get your food depending on what you order. I only give 4 stars cuz I haven't tried anything else they have there."}
