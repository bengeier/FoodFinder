{"text":"Best chicken sandwich in the Burgh!

Unfortunately because of the way I eat clean I'm not able to try their famous Reuben or any kind of sandwich along those lines, but I'll tell yinz what, this grilled chicken sandwich was just amazing. Not a hard sandwich to make by any means but the chicken breast was just so fresh, juicy and was complimented by a thicker bun. Just something I wanted to share with yinz!"}
{"text":"Pistrami on rye was great as was the chili but the potato latkes were super greasy and tasted like they were fried in old oil that had been used to fry everything from fries to old shoes"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both times were good experiences.  The food was yummy, the service was great, and the portions were large.  

I've ordered the Forbes Ave Special both times because I was craving pancakes and the special comes with choice of bread, choice of pastrami or corned beef, choice of eggs, choice of potatoes AND coffee.  Did I mention the portions were large?  The pancakes are pretty standard, but they always hit the spot and this is a deli, so clearly the spotlight should be on the meats.  I've tried both the pastrami and corned beef and both were delicious as a side and in a sandwich.  I've only tried The Rachel (corned beef and coleslaw), but I definitely want to go back and try more!  The colesslaw in the Rachel wasn't too sweet, or overdone with dressing, and it went really well with the huge stack of corned beef and buttery toasted bread.

Lastly, that most impressed me, was how efficiently they handled the huge sunday lunch crowd.  Usually, you walk in, get in line, order your food, and find your own table.  So, when we first arrived and saw that all the tables were full and the line was at least 10 deep, we almost walked right back out.  But, we were on a tight schedule and I was craving pancakes.  So we stayed, and after about 5 minutes of waiting in line, the manager/owner/someone-in-charge started to take down party sizes, assigning table numbers, and prioritizing orders to match the flow of traffic.  You could physically see the whole line change from hungry and discouraged, to excited and energetic :)"}
{"text":"Simply put-Great Deli. Unlike the others here, I dont come here for the sandwiches -I come for their great selection of quality deli meats. It only took me 1 try of Giant Eagle's rubbery roast beef to realize I wanted better. This is the place to go for those who like quality meats and cheeses, and the 10% discount for students is a huge plus (makes the premium over giant eagle smaller and thus easier to justify)."}
{"text":"This place wasn't great, but it was cheap and there's a student discount if you have your ID."}
{"text":"On my final day in Pittsburgh, my friend and I were discussing breakfast places and I mentioned that I remembered everyone on Yelp recommended Pamela's. My friend told me she knew of a place that she thought was better than Pamela's. And that is the beginning of the story of how I had the most delicious omlette I have ever had.

I usually order omlettes expecting them to be good, but usually end up disappointed in them. They somehow don't taste as good as I think they should. The spinach, mushroom, and provelone omlette I got at Smallman's was the exception. I don't know what they do, but this omlette was amazing.

I also got an order of pancakes to share along with the omlette. The pancakes were about average. They came fairly close to my personal favorite pancakes at a diner in the DC area. They were fluffy and large, tasting somewhat like buttermilk pancakes. The only negative were the single portion Smucker's Breakfast Syrup packets that come with your order. 

The toast is made on the grill giving it charred lines that just add an extra bit of flavor. The hashbrowns were not as crispy as they should have been, but I'll potatoes no matter what they taste like. The coffee wasn't bad either. 

Overall it's the atmosphere of this place that won me over. The owner took our order, and immediately made you feel felt welcome. Also, students get a 10% discount!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of delicatessens, naturally when my friend, the local, was driving around the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, I had to ask, \"What's the best delicatessen around?\" 

We stumbled on Smallman Street while walking on Murray Avenue, and it was a total standard run-of-the-mill Jewish deli...just how I like it.

Pretty good price for sandwiches at about $9 for pastrami or corned beef.

I also liked the diversity of beer options and the fact that they carried so many types of desserts and sides.

When it came time to order, I went with the classic pastrami on rye with mustard.

I gotta say that the pastrami was pretty tasty and the rye bread was one of the best I've had anywhere....BUT the mustard was incredibly lackluster. This is surprising considering that it's Pittsburgh, the city of condiments! 

I am curious next time I visit whether other deli's exist in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Jewish Pittsburgh. Smallman Street did the job though, and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible. Fatty Subway like turkey.  Take out Rachel made with corned beef not turkey.  Very dissapointing."}
{"text":"Who cares what the food taste like when you're sitting their for 40 minutes waiting for a soup and bagel? It's not even Kosher, so there's nothing keeping me there. I'd be happy to go to the Bagel Factory instead!"}
{"text":"Smallman's is a great, casual place to go with a large variety of things to choose from.  I haven't had any dinner type meals there, but their breakfast food and sandwiches are great.  You also get a lot of food for the money.  Most times I try to get something new, but if I'm ever unsure, the Reuben is the way to go.  Without a doubt one of the best Reubens around.

And when you walk into Smallman's you could easily be going back to the 50s or 60s, where you feel like part of a community and everyone knows this is the place to eat.  There's always plenty of seating, inside or out.  Whenever it's nice, the patio is the place to sit and watch the people walk by on Murray Avenue.

The staff there is always friendly and they make you feel welcome the minute you walk in."}
{"text":"Got a rueben and fries. Food was incredibly slow. 32 minutes for takeout for this small order. Way too slow for a deli.

As for the food. The fries were delicious, absolutely loved them. Rueben was sloppily made. Some parts were dry, some parts had too much sauce. Corned beef was just okay too. A little cheweyer than I'd have expected. Would have given 4 stars based no food but 32 minutes is an entire lunch break"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, my wife and I decided to give this deli a try. Unfortunately this was the biggest disappointment looking for a great corned beef sandwich or ruben. I choose the ruben. It lacked any measurable amount of corned beef any good deli would serve. The meat was tough and didn't seem like a good brand. The dressing, what dressing. One bite and that was it. A small amount in one bite. Not the sandwich for the price. 
My wife likes liver. They said they can put a scoop on a small salad. It was a regular salad. Apparently they don't know how to serve liver as any deli would, on a bed of lettuce with tomatoes and onions. My wife had to go back up to the counter to ask for tomatoes and onions. The tomatoes were not of a great quality.
Very big disappointment for calling themselves as a deli especially in a Jewish neighborhood. Would never go back. We should have known what to expect seeing only a few people seated on a Friday night for the dinner hour. They should check out Corky's and Lenny's in Cleveland to see how good a deli can be."}
{"text":"Recipe change for the worst.  I have had many meals at this deli. My fianc√© and I ordered our meals as we usually do. I ordered the meshugana omelet.  Usually it's packed with meat and goodness.  Enough meat to instantly clog ur arteries.  This morning I was given something that was disgusting.  There was hardly any meat.  They tripled the amount of onions and green peppers.  It was basically a puddle of grease inside.  When it was brought to the attention of the person in charge.  She said that they had cut back on the meat to save costs and that if I wanted it the way they made them before I would have to pay 3.00 more.  My gf paid the 3.00 and they threw the meat inside and gave me an omlete that was tough after they reheated it.  Needless to say I just left it.  If you go there, be sure to ask if they have changed the recipe of what you are ordering!   I will not be going back for awhile.  40.00 down the drain!"}
{"text":"This was a horrible deli experience. Corned beef was cold and dry. Fries were soggy and tasteless. I haven't been able to find a real Jewish deli since moving to Pittsburgh. We travelled quite a distance for a good corned beef sandwich and were totally disappointed. Will never go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Wow, this place.  I waited twenty five minutes for a bagel sandwich. Good selection of meats & cheeses, sandwich was good.  Only three customers in the shop, someone must have had to go down the street to Brueggers, have them make my sandwich, pay with pennies and find parking to get it back to my table.

Will probably go back, looks like they might have a Reuben worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and he ordered the Reuben for us. It was the best sandwich I've eaten in awhile. The waitress brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake (the German chocolate skyscraper) when he went to wash his hands, which he bought secretly and was a great surprise for me. He doesn't like sauerkraut, but they were very accommodating and put it on the side for him so that I could enjoy my half with it. I can't believe I didn't try this place out sooner. It'll be my go to place for sandwiches from now on. Plus, we seated ourselves and I ended up facing Einstein's picture the whole time. Fun stuff.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to finish the entire sandwich by myself, so the price for the portion we paid for is pretty good. I think of it as dividing the meal into two, so $5 per person really isn't all that bad. 

We went around 8:10 pm, so it was pretty empty and quiet. The menu is extensive and my experience last night makes me want to go back and try everything they have, one sandwich at a time. 


The only strange thing was that my boyfriend was facing the side where he could see the TV screen and he cringed at some point because the shows playing on it showed graphic images of burned people. I guess they forgot the health channel on...other than that, this space was clean, the service was witty and efficient, and the food was amazing! 

:)"}
{"text":"I've always had great sandwiches here. They're Rachel and smoked turkey is perfection. Unfortunately last time I went there we decided to try breakfast. My omelet was alright, too greasy, and the potatoes inedible. My boyfriend got the fish platter and it was filled with fish bones. It became pretty unappetizing"}
{"text":"I need to split this review in half.  
Their breakfast menu deserves an unqualified 5 stars.  Everything is delicious, fresh, and affordable.  The corned beef hash and murray ave breakfast special are particularly commendable.  The brown mustard on every table is a particular selling point.  They often feature creative specials which are very worth trying.  Avoid the long lines at Pamela's and come here instead!
I'm much more iffy about their lunch and dinner options.  The reuben is really the only sandwich worth getting and even that is hardly the best in town.  They serve breakfast all day, so I would really recommend you order from that even if you visit in the evening.

The overall ambiance of the place fits just right.  They sell beer and soft drink in a deli case.  You can pick up lunchmeat, cheese, desserts, and deli salads to go.  The food runners (who are not waiters, the drinks are self-serve) are always pleasant and chatty, and the owner often walks around to your tables and asks for feedback."}
{"text":"I love this place. Simple but great breakfasts and sandwiches, and I like the staff. Lots of good old NY deli style choices, plus some great desserts.  The corned beer hash is nice, and the burgers. Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Their prices are a tad high if you don't get the combo special, but if you love deli food, this is where you go in Pittsburgh.  

Their soup/sandwich/drink combo is the best deal on the menu, especially since they give you a HUGE bowl of soup, a double-stacked half sandwich and free drink refills.  I've gone in there starving, ordered a half corned beef with ruben fixings and italian wedding soup, eaten tons, and left with a bag full of leftovers.  And it was all delicious and satisfying.

This is a great place if you're looking for a place to hang out with friends; they have comfy booths, decent lighting, and it's not overly noisy.  It's also great if you are sick and just need some love."}
{"text":"Smallman Street Deli is interesting in that it is very polarized.  Some of the workers are friendly and amazing, while others make it clear that they think you are dirt, and they have no interest in helping you.  The food is the same: They have an absolutely amazing reuben, but their egg salad is the worst egg salad I have ever had.  All that said, it's a deli, so give it a try, order a turkey sandwich or a reuben, if you get someone taking your order who is rude, deal with them, and enjoy.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love the location of this deli. You could tell its old school.  I ordered a Pittsburgh fav, the Ruben,  and other memebers in our party had turkey sandwich, fries and the veggie burger.  I was impressed with the meat quality. Soo tender and flavorful. The bread on the Ruben was overcooked it was nearly burned and very greasy.  But the meat over shadowed that....lol. My fam loved all the sandwich but our fries....were dark brown as if the have been cooked in overly used oil. ..disgusting!
We spent $55 on three sandwiches and fries....;-)...pricey much?"}
{"text":"When I am in the Strip District this is the place I always go to for a fresh salad or sandwich. You can eat there or on the go. Their portions are huge ans they have a big menu for being a deli. It is also nice because rhey have their own parking and its away from all of the shops that the Strip has to offer."}
{"text":"My S.O. and I differed slightly in our opinion of this place...I ordered a tuna sandwich on wheat with a fruit side, my standard order for delis.

Van ordered a pastrami on rye, his standard deli order.  My sandwich was good, not outstanding, but not terrible.  I would order again.  Van was most unimpressed with his sandwich, he thought that the bread was stale and that the pastrami serving was stingy.  Definitely a deal breaker in his book.  

All and all, I like the location of this place, and it is very close to my favorite tea spot and shoe repair, so we may go back again- but we will save the pastrami for Langers."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant my family and I have been going to for years. I love this place! Their Ruben sandwich w/ fresh cut fries and their crunchy French toast are my favorite dishes! The portion sizes are excellent (large). Everything is kosher and always fresh! I must admit, the extensive chalkboard menu is a bit overwhelming, but I always know what I want now, so I no longer pay it much attention. The employees are always friendly. And this place also has a nice atmosphere. Feels like home."}
{"text":"Two thumbs way way up!  I don't know where to start as there is so much praise to go around.  The customer service was outstanding! Bill was so patient in explaining the amazing choices over the phone and helping me determine the selections and quantities for our Passover Seder.  Upon pickup, Mike could not have been more wonderful!  He was so gracious while preparing the order, and he packaged up everything to make it so easy for me to heat.  I told him that if the food was as half as good as the service, the meal would be a success. The food was AMAZING!  While we had too many items to outline each one, everything was wonderful!  i was so pleased as were all of the guests.  Some of the favorites were the brisket, potato latkes, spinach and squash strata, and the matzoh kugel.  Hats off smallman st. deli!!!  Many thanks for helping us to deliver a feast!!!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy burger and fries!! My husband had a very yummy chicken salad on a salad. They are very accommodating with gluten sensitivity. The GF bakery across the street sells bread and if you bring it over they will slice the bread or rolls on a clean surface and use the GF bread for no charge."}
{"text":"Get the double-play sandwich with pastrami (twice) on rye bread with deli mustard. Ask for it on the fatty side. I call it the shit kicker, because on a great day, it kicks the shit out of the overhyped Manhattan delis. Don't order lean--if you're on a diet, don't eat at a deli. 

They also stock Junior's cheesecakes, which are my favorite cheesecakes of all time."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast especially. It was very diet friendly when I was doing a no carb diet. For when I'm not on that diet, their reubens and matzo ball soup are absolutely amazing. Their baked goods always look great, but I have yet to try one. Pretty clean place, but do be warned that they don't operate as a standard restaurant which means there may be a recently used table waiting to be cleaned when you're looking to seat yourself. Usually they're very quick with this but I see a lot of people looking confused when they see it."}
{"text":"The front is for case goods deli purchases to go; the back is for sandwiches and so much more, for take-away or to eat in their large seating area,  Extensive chalkboard menu.  I got sliced nova, incredibly moist, tasty sable, and can't recall what else.  I may up my rating when I give them a more thorough try, but this rating is for the rather cool demeanor of the clerk (could have been the owner) who was actually hostile about my suggestion he keep gluten free bread on hand to make GF sandwiches.  He mentioned a GF bakery across the street, which somehow alleviates his need to provide any such products to his customers.  I say, if there's a group of 8 going to lunch, and if even one must eat gluten free, they are likely to go to a place where ALL can enjoy a meal -- not cobble it together themselves.  How much trouble can it be to keep a loaf or two of GF bread in the freezer, to toast up as needed?  Too much, evidently.

I might have bought sandwiches and sides and who knows what else, but settled for a tiny bit of sliced fish to go -- and crossed the street to Gluuteny, as he suggested, and spent the rest of my money there.  Gluuteny is a Pittsburgh treasure and the best GF bakery I've ever been to.  While an ever-growing number do, It stuns me how many restaurants, cafes, and coffee shops don't chose to carry anything from their extensive line of breads, cakes and cookies.  12% of US households buy gluten free (1% of which are the more serious Celiacs) -- that seems like a big chunk of business to be passing on when being at least \"gluten friendly\" (that is, you have wheat free products but not a clean prep kitchen) could be so very easy to secure that growing market,

Smallman will get another star when they can make a sandwich for both me and my wheat-allergic husband and friends.  The fix is just too easy and compelling people to drag around their own loaf of bread is just rude and bad business."}
{"text":"I had eaten at this establishment  once before and was extremely pleased. Today the soup was bland, the matzoh ball had no flavor, the bread was stale, and the meat was so dry it was hard to swallow. The staff was not especially pleasant either. Our order needed to be changed and that was apparently an extreme imposition.  I will not go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but I wasn't impressed, wasn't not impressed...just kind of average.  Into town for the weekend and googled 'best deli in pittsburgh' and they came up.

The staff was super nice, but we got a Rachel sandwich that just wasn't something that I feel like set them apart from anywhere else I've ever got a ruben.  Forgot the dressing which doesn't help.

But, they were super nice and I'm sure at some point I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"We will never go back to this deli again. We waited 30 minutes for a sandwich and soup when only two other customers were in the store and the staff was rude. The food was fine but certainly not worth the wait or attitude."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at Smallman Street Deli! The lunch meat is the best and the sandwiches are huge, they really pile on meat and the toppings. You can pick whatever you want on it. The place is small to eat in but you can always find a spot to sit down and eat. They also have desserts to pick from and they are amazing! This is a must stop place to grab a sandwich if you're in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I am writing this review because of one bad experience that will cause me to never go back again. I have eaten breakfast there before and the experience was always mediocre. The service was always extremely nice and it made up for eggs not being cooked right. Well, yesterday the service was TERRIBLE!

First off the deli serves breakfast but doesn't open until 9! I have to be at work at 10 so that's cutting it close. My family and I entered the restaurant about 2 minutes after 9 and there was already 1 customer seated waiting for his food. 

We went up to the counter where who I assume was the manager greeted us by saying \"I have a restaurant full of customers before any of my employees are here!\" My husband said in a joking manner that we could leave and eat somewhere else if that was an issue. The manager let out a sigh and said \"No, it's just that my employees haven't shown up yet.\" He then went on to say that, \"I'm not even open for 3 more minutes!\" My husband told him that his clock must be off because his says that it's a few minutes after 9 and that the door was unlocked. The manager continued to mutter that he still had three minutes. We left and went to Eat n' Park where the service was much friendlier."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate hang over cure. The Smallman street breakfast with ham and toast will cure what ales you. The motzo ball soup is great also. Oh did I mention how much I love their Rachel sandwich? Stacked tall with fresh corned beef, tasty coleslaw and cheese. The owner is awesome, possibly half drunk but awesome. He always says hi when you come in and makes sure you are enjoying your food."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, everything's freshly made on site...what's not to love? We got a corned beef sandwich and a turkey rachel. Plus latkes, an Israeli salad and a black and white cookie. Gotta get the black and white cookie.

The corned beef was delicious. It was soft like butter, not too salty and stacked about 1 1/2\" - 2\" high on the rye bread. I asked just for brown mustard and my only criticism of the sandwich was there could have been more mustard. Luckily, there's a squeeze bottle of the good stuff on every table.

The turkey rachel was piled high, as well. Plenty of turkey and cole slaw. Unlike the corned beef, however, this one had a little too much dressing on it. My friend had to eat the sandwich primarilly with a fork and knife...which I thought was a great idea anyway.

The Israeli salad was great. Even though tomatoes are not in season in January, they were still quite tasty. They soaked up the dressing like a sponge. The cucumbers were firm and the onions were pungent without being overpowering.

The latkes were good...but not great. It looks like they precook a bunch of them and then throw them on the grill when ordered to warm them up. They weren't as crispy as I like them but they taste very good.

We've eaten there several times before. EVerything we've gotten was delicious. And compared to other delis in Squirrel Hill, the size of the sandwiches is almost astronomical. I didn't get it yesterday but I've had the tuna before. Its hands-down, the best tuna salad I've ever had that wasn't homemade. They put eggs, onions and celery in it. Its phenomenal.

The service is great, too. Everyone is friendly and the gals are quick in clearing off your table and bringing you your food. This place is as good as it gets in town if you want deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hands down the best pastrami sandwich ever!! The staff is great all around - great customer service, friendly, clean..everything! No complaints for this place here! One thing most people do comment on is the high prices but for what you get! You really can't complain!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"bet you can't\" sandwich. At $20 a steal. A cold drink with refills, a large bag of chips and a sandwich that was as good as any deli I've ever been to. Over a pound of corned beef on rye with swiss cheese and any fixing you want. Their deli mustard is sharp and coarse ground and the bus staff will even get your soda refills for you. The cheesecake is authentic and quite a large piece, great for two to share."}
{"text":"I am thrilled there is somewhere to get good Jewish food in Pgh.  It breaks my heart that the Jewish Delis are gone in Squirrel Hill.  Parking here is wonderful for the Strip, they have their own lot.  I always get Matzo ball soup, potato pancakes and a combination, corned beef and pastrami sandwich, I have never been disappointed.  I want to try the Reuben, maybe next time.  I really miss all the good Jewish Delis in Squirrel Hill"}
{"text":"The food is great.  Selection is fantastic.  just make sure you go here when you are not concerned about calorie intake.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Very good."}
{"text":"Simple, fast, and tons of delicious options. Price very reasonable and quality very good. Clean restaurant with very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was born and raised in NY amongst the delis, so believe me when I say this place is quality. Yes, I've had better, but not by much and my standards are pretty darn high. This place makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"Came in for a greasy breakfast one morning before a jaunt to Falling Water...pretty typical diner food, but definitely hit the spot after a long night of drinking.  I had scrambled eggs, home fries and a bagel with cream cheese, and all were just fine.  Coffee was a little burnt and was self-serve in a styrofoam cup, but hey, whatever.  This place was what it was, and got the job done."}
{"text":"My wife wanted deli so we went here.  Boy, was that a mistake. Her corned beef was brown and bad. My lean pastrami was  okay, a bit better than edible.  My dad liked his salad.  The kids liked their turkey and hot dog.  So far, two and a half stars. 

The real reason for the single star was the cole slaw.  It was off.  As in, spoiled.  I had my salad eating father confirm the fact (he had to spit it out).  

When I brought it to the counter and told them, the guy was nice enough to offer me another side. He then tossed the slaw without so much as a sniff. I fear for subsequent patrons."}
{"text":"We've been here before, and the food is always delicious.  The last time we went, I had ordered some Havarti cheese to take home.  What I failed to realize was that they had not separated each slice with a piece of paper, so that when I went home and tried to make a sandwich, all I had was a clump of cheese...not slices to work with.

Today we went back, as I had a hankering for a Havarti on rye sandwich.  I kindly asked the gentleman behind the deli counter to put paper in between, and continued to relay my story from my last visit.  He was shocked that someone would be so lazy.  In turn, he sold me 4.25 worth of cheese for 3.00 in order to make it right.  He said he wants his customers to be happy so they'll come back.  He was professional and very nice, and was able to hook us up with everything we wanted.  Because of his attitude about his customers and pride in his job, we will continue to return to Smallman Street for deli purchases as well as meals.  Way to go, guys!"}
{"text":"One of the last places in Squirrel Hill that serves Matzo Ball soup and corned beef.  Were dod all of the Jewish bakeries and deli's go?  The people working there were very nice, and tried to be helpful.  My guest had some dietary concerns and wanted to order the veggie burger but they didn't know its ingredients.  They should know more about the products that they serve.  That being said, my corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup were delicious!!  We also ordered potato pancakes.  They were a bit burnt and very greasy.  The sour cream was horrible.  I don't know if it was non-dairy or light, but it was gross.  I wanted  to have blintzes but when showed me that they were in a lasagna format I decided not to try them.   I will go back basically because there are no other options for getting my Matzo ball soup fix unless I make it myself."}
{"text":"The TURKEY RACHEL should be the first thing you try... and you may like it so much it may be the last.  I can't vouch for everything on the menu, but I don't have to.  I grab the same two items every time I go in.  Fresh deli sliced turkey, with just a bit of thousand island (not drenched in it), and a fresh rye bread.  The only thing here that rivals it is the TOMATO BASIL TORTELLINI SOUP.  Paired with a double cheese grilled cheese and you got a winner.  Problem is they only do that soup once a month.  I 've had a few other items on the menu, all pretty good.  Just a solid place to eat lunch."}
{"text":"I got sick while on a work trip in Pitt. I ordered some comfort food from this place and felt much better.
The latkes were ok, but I'm ukie so nothing beats the potato pancakes that my baba makes in her special lithuanian potato mashing maserating machine! They used shredded potato pieces here.
Chicken noodle soup was great. I don't like those big chunks of veggies and chicken in my soup and this one had them diced up finely.
Lots of noodles.
Best ever - noodle kugel!! I wish I had ordered another - it was awesome!
The delivery was through \"wheeldeliver\"."}
{"text":"A good deli!!  Reasonable pricing - good food and very clean"}
{"text":"Pretty good! My husband and I enjoyed the environment, and the workers were very nice and offered us a box for our fries when we ordered two smalls without realizing how ginormous the servings are.  I got the grilled chicken, and it was pretty tasty. The provolone and banana peppers on my sandwich were both really fresh and yummy. My husband tried the Reuben per a friend's recommendation and liked it but did say he'd had better Reubens before. Definitely would recommend stopping here for a good sandwich and good fries! Parking wasn't difficult for us despite it being a Saturday, but we also live in Pittsburgh, so we're more accustomed to city parking issues. If you're coming from the suburbs or out of town, don't come on a weekend morning. And if you get the fries, one is enough for 2-4 people."}
{"text":"PROS:
- location
- fairly clean
- a shining star when compared to some of the other dining options in Pitts

CONS:
- a bit pricey (considering the portion size)

OVERALL: I'm a fan!

The bf ordered the beef brisket sandwich (which was super juicy and tender), while I got the \"award winning\" Rachel sandwich with turkey. Both were definitely good, but considering the $8.50pp, I have to knock off half a star. Also, I don't know that the Rachel sandwich was an \"award winning\" option, but it was pretty good... It was more of a glorified grilled cheese sandwich. 

I'll probably be back again."}
{"text":"Great deli meats, cheeses, sandwiches and accompaniments at a decent price. Really good homemade cheesecakes, by the slice. Also carry a variety of good beers, though these are a little pricey."}
{"text":"i don't know what else to say other than this is the best deli i have ever been to in my life.  better than any in chicago and NY, hands down.  now maybe it was only for the two sandwiches i got but i was completely blown away.

1.  reuben, unreal and awesome
2.  roast beef.  i don't know what the fuck they do to their roast beef but it was beyond anything i thought it could even possibly taste like.  it was like roast beef on HGH or some other PED.  it was absolutely fantastic.

i will never go through pittsburgh ever again without stopping here.  completely blows Primanti sandwiches out of the water which are maybe the most overrated food in all of america"}
{"text":"Potato latke Rachel is unique and genius. Flavor is excellent and the sandwich melts in your mouth. Reasonable prices and large portions. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I don't see how anybody could give this place less than 5 stars!  

The chopped liver is pretty much the best thing ever. Get it on Rye. You won't be sorry. At the matzoh ball soup, the latkes, everything I've had is amazing. The service and ambiance are also great. 

If you can only eat one meal in Pittsburgh, eat it here!"}
{"text":"YES TO EVERYTHING HERE! Three of us came to visit Pittsburgh from New York this past weekend and had really craved some deli sandwiches. New York has the best deli sandwiches... or so I thought. 

Smallman is near Frick Park, and it's a big New York style deli. We were greeted by the most friendly man when we entered, and he went through the large menu with us. We ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll, and 2 pastrami with egg and cheese on a roll. It totaled up to be less than $25 which is insane. Katz Deli is over $20 for one sandwich. 

The sandwiches were heavy (pretty oily), but great. Large portions, friendly staff, CHEAP, and great quality. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd frequent this place. If I visit Pittsburgh again, this will be my first stop. 

Definitely check it out. Everything is very affordable and you'll have the NY deli experience but with friendly waiters. Very memorable."}
{"text":"I've been to Smallman street about fives times. I've generally liked my food and have had multiple types of entrees and sides. I really like the different sides and salads, but was generally underwhelmed with the omelette and tuna melt. The desserts are pretty good and they have a ton of different options for drinks. Three out of the four times the cashier has been a little abrasive, but never actually *rude*. The service is also very fast. I've never waited for over ten minutes for take out or eating in."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered a reuben and a pastrami sandwich to split half and half. We loved both of them! My only criticism is that the reuben was pretty skimpy on the meat.

I wouldn't come here during lunch time if you're in a hurry. Our sandwiches took about 25 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"For a place that doesn't even do its own meats, it puts on airs of being a legitimate Jewish Deli. The overrating of the place is most likely due to its lack of competition. There are some good cooks who put out tasty food, and friendly waitstaff, but the owner would rather nickel and dime you than have you leave with a positive experience. Turns out, you can't order a side of latkes and only two eggs. You have to order the two eggs, potatoes, and toast.  And you can't sub a Latke for the potatoes. And if you order Challah toast, be prepared for only one slice as opposed to an expected two slices of toast. Cost more for Challah."}
{"text":"Ok, I am officially a deli nut. I like the wide range of sandwiches and I found another good one in the Smallmen Street Deli.  I would probably recommend take out here because the parking stinks and the place seats about 20-30 tops. 

Well lets focus on the grub. The price is a tad expensive.  I went with a traditional roast beef on rye with cheddar and the usual fixings. The portion is enormous and I added a side of slaw that I really didn't need. I ate it all. :) I plan on heading back to try out a some more sandwiches and after checking out some other plates I think I should have gone with some other ones.  The burger looked good but I don't do those at a deli. Sorry about the pic I took it doesn't do the sandwich justice. It was huge!"}
{"text":"We accidentally stopped by this place one day that we were wondering around murray street and for sure we will be going back! Smallman Street Deli has a huge variety of deli sandwich made of fresh ingredients.  We ordered their signature sandwich (with their own made roast beef) and the special of the day which was a turkey-gouda sandwich.  There were very delicious and so where the sides that came with it (coleslaw and potato salad).  The service is also extremely friendly and fast.  And if you did not have enough there, you can always buy some products for home (cheese, meat and even deserts).  I will definitely be going back.  This is definitely a 5-star deli place (I just gave it 4 starts because it is exactly this; just a deli place)."}
{"text":"About once in five years I try this place. About 20 minutes later I realize why I don't go back more often. Pittsburgh used to have great delis. It hasn't for years. This is yet another example."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! A little pricey, which is why I only gave 4/5. Everything ive ever tried was great. We order lunch here at work every once and a while and everyone is always pleased!"}
{"text":"Ever since Kyzanskis closed, this is the de facto deli in sq hill. It's pretty good and I like their Reubens. Their Matzoh is good but nothing to write home about. Their soda fountain is kinda dirty."}
{"text":"A very good Jewish deli tucked in and amongst the small factories and warehouses on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret. 

There were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben, turkey and Swiss on a bagel to a pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and a turkey and cheese on a bread type that escapes me. Regardless, all the sandwiches were very good to excellent. The meat was lean and adequately piled on. The vegatables on the sandwiches were very fresh. All sandwiches came with a Kosher pickle spear and we opted for bags of Snyder of Hanover chips. I haven't had Snyder chips since I left Pittsburgh eons ago. 

The amount of sandwiches offered were many. The staff were efficient and three-rivers friendly. 

I failed to realize that they offered Matzo ball soup. I will have to save that for a return trip to PGH. Since the in-laws live here, that's definitely going to happen."}
{"text":"After living in New York for a few years, I became a bit of a deli snob. One rachel and matzoh ball soup order later, and I was reassured that Pgh can hold its own in the deli scene! This is definitely our go-to place for grabbing a quick meal, or when we are craving a sammy. The food is very reasonably priced, and the staff is quite friendly. Also, a bonus is that they have bottled beer available for you to sip on with your meal."}
{"text":"Do not order from them on GrubHub as it is set up incorrectly and employees don't know how to use it properly."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal! The corned beef Ruben is messy and delicious. Everything you hope for in a deli sandwich. We were even able to find a table to sit today."}
{"text":"I was really craving nothing more than a sandwich for lunch one day.  Not just any sandwich, but an egg salad sandwich.  Every so often you get the craving to eat an egg salad sandwich, it is not an everyday occurrence, but when it happens you have to satisfy that need and ebb that craving for another few months.

I was in the Squirrel Hill area and decided that this would be the perfect time to visit Smallman Street Deli.  I love the deli atmosphere in here, the aromas that linger, the fast pace of it all.  I was kind of like a tourist when I walked through the door.  Taking it all in, head up in the air, not paying attention to where I was going.  However I was aware of my surroundings and stopped to place my order.  One egg salad sandwich.  Oh, and an order of fresh cuts fries.

The seating area was spacious.  No need to feel as if you were invading anyone's personal space.  I think at the time I was here there weren't many people inside at all so that made it feel that much more spacious inside.  Once settled, my food arrived and I couldn't do anything else but focus on that.  Well, after I took a picture of it of course.

The bread was fresh and the consistency of the egg salad itself is everything I had hoped it would be.  Not runny and not overly mayo'd.  A nice heaping helping of it between the slices really made it a meal unto itself.  The crisp pickle was a nice compliment to the sandwich, but I couldn't forget the fresh cut fries.  They were as good as I hoped they would be.  I love any business that will take the time to make some fresh cut fries.  I mean the fries have such a great taste that you don't have to worry about what was added to them if they were frozen.  I honestly should have taken them to snack on at a later time.  After I finished everything I kind of had to waddle out of here."}
{"text":"I really love this deli, which is the closest you'll get to NYC here in Pittsburgh. The people here are really nice, sandwiches are huge & tasty. I love their fish sandwiches when they're available (during Lent! Yes!), their Reuben's are great, and their burgers & cold sandwiches are good too."}
{"text":"Take a really crummy day weather-wise--what better reason to go out and have a great sammitch for lunch?  Actually those who know me know any reason is a good reason to have a great sammitch.  Weddings, confirmations, bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, the 8th anniversary of your second cousin's third promotion at work, or the fact that you're just plain hungry--all are great reasons!

I went for the Junior Signature Sandwich of pastrami on rye.  Sorry, I just can't manage the full-sized one unless I'm sharing.  But oh my, it may have been the smaller version but it was good.  They say they make their meat homemade on the premises and boy is it obvious.  My friend Marla went for the Double Play Combo of kosher bologna and kosher salami.  Uh, okay hon!  

And for you \"Seinfeld\" fans, they have the Uncle Leo here for breakfast--the Lox, Egg & Onion.  I've gotta try that sometime.  It looks like Smallman Street Deli is gonna be stiff competition for my other two favorite sandwich places--Ruggeri's and Frick Park Market."}
{"text":"Good Eats.

This is a nice easy place to eat.  The foodstyle style is a homemade feeling .. and its very nicely priced.  Great easy eats."}
{"text":"I don't like being called a Smallman. Not at all. But apparently this deli does.

The Smallman Street Deli is a Pittsburgh original over in the Strip District and it's absolutely fantastic. Really wonderful Jewish style deli sandwiches that remind me of New York City. But somewhat cheaper!

This location doesn't do them quite as well as the original in my limited experience but they still deserve four stars. The original smallman Street Deli is a five-star experience. But either way the corned beef and pastrami are excellent and affordable."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich(hot) was great. Tender and plenty of flavor. The only thing I didn't care for was the $14.50 for the sandwich, can of soda, and bag of chips."}
{"text":"When I start to miss NY deli food, I head to Smallman St. Deli. It isn't the same, but it's not bad. They make as good a pastrami sandwich and cup of matzo ball soup as you can find without driving for several hours, but it lacks the intensity of experience of a serious NY are deli; the kid taking your order or making your sandwich has probably never even tasted pastrami, whereas it's close to religion in NY and the sandwich maker might well have been making such sandwiches since before you were born. Thus it is about halfway between Katz's and Subway."}
{"text":"Typical Jewish deli where atmosphere is lacking, cleanliness is so-so, but the food is insane! I had a tuna melt with swiss cheese on top and mashed potatoes on the side. I probably would not get the mashed again, simply because they are too heavy with such a large sandwich. While it was delicious, I should have tried their extra lean corned beef with potato salad on the side. I would gladly go back for any of the salads, sandwiches, or breakfast! I am a fan!!!"}
{"text":"New to town. I had first wanted to try Nu Jewish Bistro nearby but it was already overcrowded and many people were waiting outside. I thought I would try this place instead and I'm glad I came!   Great food overall!!"}
{"text":"Simple egg and American breakfast sandwich on Rye - added lettuce, tomato and mayo. They use real eggs which is a huge plus for me, and they had quite a few options for bread."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had one of the best reuben's I've ever had, and when I went to bed last night my diet wept silent tears into its pillow.  This sandwich is HUGE.  Everything about it was perfect, but if anything I wish they would have given me a little less meat.  I think there was 2 lbs of corned beef on this thing.  Basically the reuben is a fat bomb, but soooo worth the splurge once or twice a month.

They have indoor and outdoor seating and this place is a lot more than a lunch spot/sandwich shop, it is very much a full deli.  You can call ahead and order (for example) steaks for dinner, and they'll have them ready for you when you leave.

This is by no means the cheapest lunch spot in the strip dist.  I had a reuben and a side of potato salad and it was about $14.

But the reuben is grilled for you right as you order it.  It was freaking huge, I did not need the potato salad.  

The menu is really diverse, there are a lot of soups and salads so I will def be back even on days where I dont feel like going full on fat girl."}
{"text":"Love the Smallman Deli! I used to work near here, and I used to love coming! Everything is delicious - I always look forward to their cheese fries! My only complaint is sometimes it takes a very long time to get your food - but it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"I think this location is even better than the Strip District location. I like that it's larger and has more seating options. I find the service here is also better.

I originally came here often for lunch - but then I discovered breakfast. It's delicious! I love their egg sandwiches - it's a nice alternative to other breakfast options in the area. And you have to try the red velvet cake! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"I have been hoping to test out Smallman Street Deli for a while now, and I finally stopped in on a Sunday morning at 11:15 am.  The deli was pretty deserted, and as others have mentioned, the employees are super indifferent about working here.  Luckily, while being a bit pricey for Pittsburgh, the food is good.

I went halfsies so I could try both a Reuben ($12.99) and a Rachel ($12.99).  The corned beef on both sandwiches was really good.  It is piled on, but they slice it thinly. Even better, there was very little fat in the meat.  Since there is so much meat, the saurkraut and coleslaw were really difficult to taste while eating the sandwich.  When I could taste them, though, they were pretty good.  The rye bread both sandwiches came on was yummy too, and they packaged things nicely so that they stayed hot, even as a to go order.

All in all, a little pricey, but good meats."}
{"text":"Great deli.  Had a very good Ruben today.  Great food and friendly service.   I'll definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"The hashbrowns were swimming in oil and almost deep fried. The restaurant wasn't busy so I assume the cook had better things to do. The staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Sometimes a girl just wants some Matzoh Ball soup and this place is one of my faves... I will say it has been inconsistent from time to time (sometimes being less flavorful than others but that is not always the case--- I have been satisfied more times than not.  Sandwich selection is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions.  

We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately).  

I will keep patronizing this yummy place..."}
{"text":"Pros: friendly and quick service, great food, relatively good prices

Cons: NONE (not that I can think of right now...)

Tucked in the row of Squirrel Hill restaurants/shops is this gem.  It opened up the second year I was in Pittsburgh...and my life was never the same again!

I typically get the matzo ball soup and the turkey sandwich here.  This was one of those must-go places on any return visit to Pittsburgh.  I never had that much Jewish food before coming to Pittsburgh and was impressed by this.

My new york friends claim this is just a wannabe of nyc delis, but hey I didn't grow up there!  

I have come here so many times during my breaks from researching and those things that grad students do.  The owner recognizes me and often gives me the nod of familiarity.

I have never been a big fan of corned beef, but my friends have always loved the Reuben and Rachel.

I am still in love with the matzo ball soup here.  PDC in Shadyside comes in as a close second.  But the ball is perfectly soft and not too hard.  Just one wrapped in warm chicken broth.  My former roommate loves the fries here, but I often gulp them so quickly that I don't remember how they taste like.

There was once that I came in ordering a full picnic with 4+ sandwiches.  They helpfully came up with an easy way for me to carry it.

I have never been to the Smallman's downtown in the Strip, so I cannot comment on the difference.  Regardless, I love you Smallman's!"}
{"text":"I love me some Matzoh ball soup, so one day, when I was under the weather, I treated myself to the Smallman Street Deli when I was home for lunch.  Now, on other occasions, the soup was way better than it was this time so I cannot give them 5 stars as there is apparently some inconsistency.  Other than that, I have never had anything bad from here... whether it is a sandwich, soup, bagel, etc. you cannot go wrong.

On this particular occasion, I opted for a grilled cheese sandwich too and lets just say, between the sandwich and the matzoh soup, I started to feel much better.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: At first glance, the place seems a little shabby with cheap banquet seating and unlit disarrayed deli meat cases. The chalk board menu is also a little overwhelming with the sheer number of options but the staff are really helpful in helping you find or design the sandwich you want. You take your number to a table and they'll bus your table after you leave.

Food: I'll say this was probably one of the best deli sandwiches I've had in town. Peppis has good sub-style sandwiches and Nu Jewish Bistro has a helluva good Reuben but they're only open on the weekends, Smallman fills the need for a good deli sandwich joint open all week long. Their sandwiches are piled high and their corned beef and pastrami are all delicious. They slice their meats super thin so it falls apart in your mouth and they're heated through without steaming so the flavor isn't diluted at all. The plain rye we had was unremarkable, not particularly dry or moist and not too rye-y. The pickle was fairly standard as well, similar to a claussen pickle you get at the store.

Overall Smallman won me over and will likely be my go to deli sandwich shop. It won't win any ambiance awards anytime soon but the food speaks for itself. Highly-recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place, such good meat on the sandwiches. I order takeout and they are fast! Thank you"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch here one day and was very impressed. It's located in the strip, but at 28th so it's not impossible to find a parking spot!

The food was good, the staff was friendly. If you are looking for something more than your typical deli sandwich, this is the place for you. They offer cold and hot sandwiches, wraps, etc. I ordered a turkey wrap, which was good, but after tasting my friend's corned beef, I should have gotten that! Definitely hearty sandwiches that will not leave you hungry!"}
{"text":"Great deli for lunch!  Nice atmosphere and plenty of classic deli sandwiches.  We enjoyed the famous Rachel on rye and chicken salad on multigrain.  Limited parking."}
{"text":"i was in charge of choosing our thursday dinner, which basically means 'ehhh let's eat out!' i looked to yelp & filtered the search to the squirrel hill area. we're always eating out in oakland & shadyside, so i wanted to go on a new adventure. plus the breakfast all day thing sold me (& i have a bf who is anti EnP sooooo.. this was the decision)

i ordered the murray ave breakfast special; 2 eggs any way, choice of meat (sausage PATTIES! fresh!), home fries (soft yet a nice crisp), toast, & coffee (can make it a soft drink, but i chose the coffee-- free refills) 

anytime we go to a new place, bobby asks the server (well cashier in this case) whats popular or what they reccomend. she informed us the Reuben and Rachel were the most popular & his eyes lit up. it must have been a good 2yrs since he's had one. he was pleased with his sandwhich which also came with a pickle. 

now.. to THE BEST part! on our way out the door, bobby says \"we forgot dessert!\" (actually, my plan was to stop at waffalonia 2 blocks away because i didn't know they had dessert). then we noticed the cake-- oh. my. goodness! giant 4-5 layer cake, a slice bigger than your hand! they have awesome cakes too! one is called the candy bar and it was like hershey bars, snickers pieces, ect on a piece of cake (that one wasn't 4 layers.. just a regular piece of delicious cake) we decided on the German Chocolate cake. it was seriously an amazing treat! we shared one piece and ate in 3 different increments. HUGEE! 

i'm looking forward to going back.  or we'll head back when that german chocolate cake is calling our name all the way from squirrel hill :D"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing matzo ball soup ever (sorry mom). Where I need to be esp when I am sick. While here I stock up on amazing rye bread and kosher salami. Great salads, latkes. Save room for dessert; they have the best in town. Cheesecake is imported from NYC and is to die for. Will keep coming back for kosher style deli!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner tonight with CM and a few of his friends.  One of them organized the dinner and chose Smallman St. Deli due to its proximity to the Manor Theatre, since several of them were planning to see Avengers there afterward.  Although CM and I didn't see the movie, I was excited to try the deli since I'd heard good things, and had been favorably impressed by a catered sandwich from there.

Everyone in our group ordered different things, with some people opting for breakfast foods, and others opting for sandwiches.  Since I like to try whatever a restaurant is known for on my first visit, and I don't eat beef, I ordered a turkey Rachel ($10.99).  CM opted for a Yellowfin tuna sandwich ($8.99), and we also split an order of pasta salad ($2.99).  The Reuben came on toasted Rye bread, and was stuffed with a generous quantity of turkey and cole slaw, which was of the creamier variety.  It was pretty good, but I was hoping for bolder flavors--then again, to be fair, turkey isn't known as a particularly flavorful meat.  Also, pieces of the cole slaw kept falling out as I ate the sandwich, which is one of my pet peeves--I like a sandwich that sticks together!  CM's sandwich surprised him a bit, since he was expecting fried fish, but it was filled with tuna salad; however, he didn't mind, since he hadn't had tuna in awhile.  He ordered his sandwich on pumpernickel with all the fixings, and came to regret the latter decision since the fillings, like the cole slaw, had a tendency to fall out as he ate, and he didn't want as many banana peppers as he was given.  Although I didn't ask anyone else directly how they liked their food, judging from the speed with which they ate their meals, I think it's safe to say that they liked them.  :-)

At the time of our visit (5:30pm on Fri.), the deli was pretty empty.  We hoped to take advantage of the pleasant weather by sitting on the open porch, but the doors were locked, and none of the employees could find (or wanted to bother finding) the keys.  Service was pretty efficient, given the size of our group--we received our sandwiches about 10 min. after ordering.  I felt that the prices were a tad high, but then again, the quality is better than at other delis I've tried, so I can't complain too much.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Smallman St. Deli, and would definitely return--I'd love to try the desserts some time, since I've heard they they're delicious!"}
{"text":"The deli meats here are totally legit. The reuben, with its delicious beef, toasted bread, and accompanying kraut make a great and extremely filling combination. Their pastrami was great too, which I tried with the rye sandwich. For the latter, I actually got their special Stan-wich, which also came with corned beef in addition to pastrami. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of their famous meats. I would probably mention that the rye bread was a bit hard, especially around the crust, so I'd stick with just the reuben or rachel."}
{"text":"Had to give these guys another thumbs-up !

 I stopped in today for breakfast to find a deal on Pumpkin Pancakes with walnuts and cranberry syrup. ! 

Wow what a combination huh ? 

Let me tell ya , they were GREAT. My breakfast with coffee totaled less than $10.00 and I was full for the whole day.



You cannot be disappointed here , Breakfast , lunch or dinner. Fast friendly staff excellent service.

Great Job Guys , Keep up the good ..... Great Job."}
{"text":"A favorite spot for 'soul food' as my fianc√© calls it. I just call it delicious. The pastrami and chopped liver is probably my favorite. Of course you must have thin sliced onion, deli mustard and a yummy pickle spear to make it complete. The people are always pleasant and helpful and there is open air seating weather permitting. Just a great little Jewish deli for a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Smallman Street Deli on Murray Avenue has a welcome and warmth that invites you to stay and enjoy.  The food is great.  The deli has an open floor plan that encourages a warm neighborhood feeling.  Go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food obnoxious staff. Rundown diner vibe - I didn't enjoy it.

Gingerbread pancakes came with nothing and were almost $8. Nothing special and overpriced.

The staff was rude. I ordered a cup of water. When they brought my food over they said can I bring anything else, I said yes, I asked for some water. The lady responded \"get it yourself\". She's lucky that out of respect for my friends I didn't say anything - had I been alone, I would told that toothless witch about her attitude. My friends left a tip, I left my trash...
 
Not planning on a return trip here...."}
{"text":"Smallman Street Deli is *the* deli in Squirrel Hill.  Everything here is good.  The chalkboard menu is a bit intimidating because there are just SO MANY choices.  I got the baked ham and Havarti cheese on Bolki roll, which came with a pickle slice, and hugged it up with a bottled black cherry soda.  Everything was fresh and tasty!

Only reason it doesn't get 5/5 is because I've been to delis in NYC and well, that's where 5/5 lives."}
{"text":"Love living in Squirrel Hill.  What could be worse than a breakfast at The Bagel Nosh?  Well a breakfast at the Smallman St Deli.. Burnt toast, tasteless omelet and of course inedible home fries.. At least the people are nice.."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place. Everything I have had there has been wonderful. The workers are friendly and have personality - they were teasing my father for wearing his Cleveland Browns hat in Steelers town, but in the end decided he \"must be an okay guy\" since he ordered a Reuben.

I love it when it's warm enough to sit in the \"outside\" part of the dining area. There is nothing better than enjoying a tasty sandwich while people-watching. 

Definitely a legit deli. Check it out if you're in the area. There's a discount for students too - don't forget!"}
{"text":"I love the matzo ball soup and the nova special (bagel with lox, cream cheese, capers, red onion and tomato). The soup broth is especially delicious. I have been searching for good matzo ball soup in Pittsburgh and have tried a few places, this soup is my favorite."}
{"text":"Usually when I go to a sandwich place like this, I get a Reuben and base everything on how well they can make a Reuben. So, that's what I did. 
First off very limited seating but it wasn't too hard to grab a table. Ordered a Reuben and fries, both were very good. My only thing is that the corned beef on my sandwich was kinda tough to chew. But the sauerkraut and dressing ratio to meat was perfect. The fries! I thought the fries were seriously amazing. 

I would absolutely go back and try something else since they passed the Reuben test."}
{"text":"I used to go to Sammys all the time for a corned beef sandwich whenever i came in town....until my mom took me to Smallman Street Deli! Best corned beef on rye...be sure to get it grilled!!! My sandwich...lean corned beef on marble rye, swiss cheese, grilled with lettuce, tomato, onion and spicy brown mustard!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I like to stop here occasionally to see what fabulous beer is in the $3 tub on the counter.  Always good seasonal choices!

My most recent visit I picked up a turkey burger for takeout.  It takes quite a while to cook, so if you're in a hurry, don't pick this.  But who wants an uncooked turkey burger - so take your time cooking it Smallman Street Deli!

The staff is always friendly and this is a nice neighborhood joint.  Buy some deli meat, cheese, pastries, or order some brisket and soup - eat in or take home.  Just don't leave without picking up some cold $3 beers from the tub on the counter!"}
{"text":"Horrible Quality! Not Fresh Bread! ( They tell you it was made 2 hours ago ) Dry Corned Beef..... Embarrassing........went back 6 months later! Bread still horrible"}
{"text":"French fries are not a healthy choice, but when I make that choice, Smallman Street makes them perfectly crisp. Just add vinegar. Delightful! Staff is friendly. Great place for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Man, EFF Deluca's. I was jonesing for an omelet on Monday so we drove down to the Strip hoping to get breakfast only to be greeted by a line of 35 or more people. Normally I would have waited but It was way too damn hot to stand outside on this particular day. So we drove to Squirrel Hill since we were going to the movies afterwards anyway. My husband remembered that Smallman Street Deli had breakfast.

There was ZERO wait in the place, which I was happy to see. I ordered an omelet with mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. Husband got the crunchy French toast. My meal was excellent. A hearty sized omelet, well-seasoned and lots of filling. The home fries are made from red skin potatoes and well-seasoned where most places just give you plain potatoes with no salt or anything. Very tasty. Mr.'s French toast was sweet, hearty, and had a satisfying crunchy coating. I was a little put off by the packets of Smucker's syrup though...they could spring for some syrup in a pourer or at least a bottle.

I like the service setup...you order at the counter, they bring your food, you get your own drinks. It's low-key and you don't have to worry about waiting around for a server to refill your beverage or being rushed out the door.

So like I said, eff Deluca's and their long lines. This place was just as delicious, if not more so, the prices are about the same, and there was no wait, so this is my new breakfast place."}
{"text":"Truth be told, this place is kind of a let down. The only saving grace was the reuben, which was quite fantastic. 

I ordered the following:

Matzo Ball Soup - Served lukewarm, no vegetables in the actual broth, which isn't a bad thing usually, but it was in this case because the broth itself was pretty bland. It tasted like normal, run of the mill, canned chicken broth. The matzo ball itself wasn't up to my standards.  A bit too firm, not enough flavor.  Overall, the soup was just a letdown considering this is supposed to be one of the best delis in the city. The gold standard, in my opinion, is 2nd Avenue Deli in NYC, and this soup didn't even come close.

Chopped Liver - Average. I've certainly had worse, but it didn't really excite me.  I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it kinda had an odd aftertaste to it.  It wasn't necessarily bad, just kinda odd. Would I order it again? Sure. But I wouldn't get super jazzed about it.

Reuben - Very very good.  The rye bread had a fantastic crunch to it, the corned beef was very good, the sauerkraut was great and the dressing was wonderful... overall the sandwich was very good.  It was definitely one of the top 5 reuben's I've ever had.

My friend, Nema S. got the steak sandwich.  Wow. What a joke. It literally looked like dog food; it was as if they took Jack Links beef jerky nuggets, and put them on a kaiser roll.  No cheese. No onions. No condiments. Nothing.  Steak nuggets, which were overcooked by the way, on bread.  That's it.  Pretty despicable.  Then again, you shouldn't make a habit of ordering steak sandwiches at Jewish delis.

The bottom line is, for a deli that is supposed to be one of the best in the city, it doesn't hold a candle to those in NYC or Philly."}
{"text":"I love Reuben sandwiches. Every new place I go I must try one. Smallman's has one of the best Reuben's in Pittsburgh and maybe anywhere. The rye bread is perfect and grilled to perfection on the grill with butter. The corned beef, I mean it is Smallman's so it gets no better than their deli cuts. Finally the sandwich comes with the perfect amount of kraut and dressing, a good Reuben can be ruined by too much of either of these ingredients.

Smallman's Reuben is not the largest you will find but will definitely be the best in terms of quality you can eat. And it comes with a pickle! Man, do I love dill pickles, and Smallman's is spectacular."}
{"text":"After searching high and low, I can say that the Smallman Street Deli is probably the second best delicatessen in Pittsburgh.  That's not a huge compliment, however, as the deli scene is almost completely devoid of passable options (the only one I even like is Szmidt's, and they have a much smaller menu).

This Squirrel Hill eatery is but a shadow of the pastrami purveyors of New York City.  Were it to move across the state, Smallman Street would be but a footnote, unable to crack anyone's Top 10 list in Philadelphia.  But sometimes a facsimile is good enough, or even the best one can get.  While there may be better beef brisket and superior salami on distant horizons, one can still enjoy the capable corned beef and likable lox in this little corner of Western PA."}
{"text":"I religiously order the same thing at both locations and it is excellent each time: the turkey rachael on sourdough instead of rye. The matzo ball soup, while not like mom's, is still very tasty. Fellow diners I have eaten with have ordered the corned beef, the roast beef, and the pastrami and have raved about them all. I highly recommend this authentic deli."}
{"text":"I hoped/knew this place would be good.  You can't have a deli in the Jewish-est neighborhood in Pittsburgh and not have it be delicious.  And it's but two blocks from my house!  Who lucked out?  That would be me.

We went here for a brunch on Sunday - if you can call it brunch at 2pm.  Plenty of seating.  I ordered the half sandwich/cup of soup/fountain drink deal.  It was something like $8.50, which was a pretty good deal.  Also, I wanted an old fashioned cream soda instead of a fountain drink, which costs extra but they didn't charge me.  yay!

Soooo service was pretty slow, but there seemed to be only one woman taking out food orders and cleaning tables, so I can't really hold that against her.  My corned beef sandwich arrived on rye, with spicy brown mustard, and a bit of Swiss cheese.  My matzo ball soup arrived hot, with a big fat fluffy matzo ball just chillin' in the middle.  Everything was very delicious.  The corned beef was juicy, the bread was fragrant, the matzo ball was soft and delicious in my mouth.  Big fan of my meal.  

I would love to come back for breakfast, lunch, or just to get some deli meat/cheese goodness.  And I WILL come back, because as I said, it's just two blocks away!  Yup, living the good life in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"This was a really great deli that we stumbled upon on our way to #pvgp.  Easy to get some to-go deli sandwiches and sweet bites for our picnic lunch!  Open early, even on Sunday!

The executive chef, Mr. Proakis was super nice and very helpful!  His son designed the poster for #pvgp, which we thought was really cool.

The choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner are varied and really good.  If we lived in the #squirrelhill neighborhood, we'd be here all the time!

Plenty of seats and a TV as well."}
{"text":"This place was cute. It is cafeteria style eating. More so designed for the worker on their lunch break, or shopper on the go. My kids were accommodated although there was no kids menu. Prices were a little high for me given the experience although I'm sure I payed for freshness. My Burger from the last kitchen of the four, was great. The drinks at the bar were $2 a piece, and the bathroom was clean. I'd go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice with the kids. 
Shout out to Garland who took care of me and the fan while I was there. He made my experience wonderful. Great customer service from the whole team."}
{"text":"A decent deli for Pittsburgh but this place is no match for other deli's around the country.  It will never be a Brent's (LA)!  They have a huge menu with very reasonable prices.  The staff is very friendly....

I started off with a bowl of matzo ball soup.  This was one of the worst bowls that I have every have - 2 lumps of matzo balls in chicken broth.  There was no carrots, noodles, chicken or flavor.  

I ordered the corned beef and latkes for dinner.  The latkes were excellent served with applesauce and sour cream.  The Noodle Kugel side that I ordered was OK but not great; definitely didn't taste homemade.  The corned beef was very average and looked and tasted closer to grocery store quality than deli quality.  

I saw some of the sandwiches that others ordered (reuben vs. rachel (coleslaw instead of sauerkraut)).  They looked very good.  

Are there no bakeries in Pittsburgh?  They get their deserts from New York (German Chocolate cake, Carrot Cheesecake, Key Lime Pie, Coconut Cake, and Red Velvet cake)."}
{"text":"Super sad effort to be a Jewish style deli. I ordered a Chopped Liver salad with Rye, and was brought a chopped liver sandwich on some kind of white/sourdough. The liver itself was horrible. Gristly and flavorless. I barely touched it. Liver is one of my favorite foods, too. 

My partner had chicken noodle soup, which looked straight up like it came out of a can or vat style soup. Noodles disintegrated as he ate them. 

Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's a terrible thing when you work next to a New York style deli... terrible.  Oh shoot... I forgot my lunch today.  Guess I'll just have go grab a sandwich...

You really cannot go wrong with the Smallman Street Deli.  Though around noon it gets pretty packed, you can call your order in ahead to avoid the line.  Whether you desire a Rueben, burger, or homemade soup, you'll leave thinking you were in NYC.

The princing is a tad on the high end for a deli, but everything is cooked to order and fresh.  There are some seats available - outdoor seating in the warmer months too.

If you're in the Strip and want a sandwich, stop by Smallman Street Deli."}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in Pittsburgh. It's one of the few places where I can get a sandwich that would be acceptable to serve in New York. All the meats, cheeses, toppings, and breads are fresh and of high quality. Smallman also offers a number of entrees (from breakfast through dinner) and delicatable soups (matzo ball to name one).

The staff is also very accomdating."}
{"text":"This restraunt has great fries and sandwiches. However beware of their \"Matzo ball soup.\" Technically it's a soup as it was served in broth. However any Jewish person knows that is not real matzo ball soup. The matzo ball is bland and the soup flavorless. Lacks the parsnip, carrots, and other vegetables that really make the soup explode with that flavor your family makes during the holidays. It really needs to be removed from their menu. If you can't make it right, don't have it. ( I miss Toojays in Florida.) Don't bother calling them it will aggravate you before you step in the door. The man was quick to place you on hold before you speak and I was hung up on three times before they actually spoke to me. Parking was sucky as most of Pennsylvania consists of. So to people from here it's normal.

 For people like me most of Pennsylvania needs to be torn down and rebuilt to have places with real parking lots. (No offense meant.) And to combat anyone who does take offense, living here was not by choice. Give me a million dollars and I would be happy to move. A little off topic sorry.

Nice little restraunt which if I want good fries and a ruben I wouldn't mind going again."}
{"text":"More \"delis\" should take a lesson in how to be good from this place.  My office is about 2 blocks away from the SSD and has been for about 5 years.  That means I've eaten here quite a few times.  And honestly, I've never been disappointed.  Actually, not living in Pittsburgh anymore, I've yet to find an authentic deli that's this all-around good here in Denver.  But don't worry, I'll keep trying.

Their sandwiches are huge and delicious - high quality (and quantity) meats and cheese.  The breads are delicious.  The soups are delicious - the stuffed pepper is to die for.  I used to find myself stalking the menu for stuffed pepper soup day.  Their chili is good.  Their salads are good.  Lots of folks in my office stalk the menu for taco salad day as well.  Do you see a theme here?   

It gets insanely busy at lunch, and there's not much space inside to move around and wait for your order, but it's a small price to pay for deli food that's this good.  You should eat here!"}
{"text":"Smallman Street Deli was one of the very first places I dined at on my first trip to Pittsburgh, and the first Squirrel Hill eatery I tried. I don't know why it's taken me three years to come around to writing this review. I guess it's fitting that it's also one of my last meals in Pittsburgh before I move away.

Since I was born and raised in NYC, I have a soft spot for delis. (You had me at black and white cookie.) I like the atmosphere here--it's always nicely air-conditioned on hot days, and there's plenty of seating. The ordering system works here--order and pay at the counter, get a number for your table, and then choose any available table in the dining area. They even have a covered patio, if you want to be up close and personal with bustling Murray Ave.

All the food I've had here has been solid--egg salad sandwiches, the crunchy French toast, silver dollar pancakes, the Mediterranean veggie sandwich. Portions are good and those silver dollar pancakes are about the size of regular pancakes I make at home. (A friend once ordered the regular pancakes and they were the same size as the plate.) The thing is, nothing really jumps out at me as noteworthy. Granted, I can't judge many of the things other reviewers have raved about like the Reuben and Rachel and other cold cut sandwiches.

Still, because of its extensive menu, and its ample seating, I'd recommend Smallman Street Deli as a good place to go if you're eating with a bunch of people who have varying food preferences and you need some sort of middle ground."}
{"text":"This review is exclusively about breakfast. Our group was especially hungry for a good breakfast, but \"the breakfast place\" up the street was pack. I was aware that Smallman's had a substantial breakfast menu so I dragged the group here and all of us were extremely impressed. Within our group we had a bagel, an omelet, pancakes and corned beef hash, and no one voiced one complaint. I especially liked the brewed coffee, as it was above average in quality. I found the prices to be very reasonable and there is plenty of room to find a table. As a result, this has become our favorite breakfast spot in Squirrel Hill, without a doubt."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is so damn good! I'm still dreaming of their reuben sandwhiches all the way from Austin, TX. This is a must eat!"}
{"text":"My first experience here, during which I got a corned beef sandwich to go, was awesome.  Based on this and other reviews raving about their reubens, I think this deli truly excels at their corned beef!

I returned to buy roast turkey deli meat and cheese, though, and was quite disappointed.  Their turkey is $8.99/lb and a far cry from being as good as the Boar's Head turkey that Butler St. Deli sells for $7.49/lb.  I was also somewhat disappointed in the quality of the pepperjack cheese I bought there.

The service is also hit-or-miss.  I doubt anyone here is downright rude, but some guys are friendlier than others.  There are some nice tables and chairs to sit down and enjoy your sandwiches/burgers, but only outdoors as far as I can tell.

In conclusion: come for the corned beef, but skip the deli turkey/cheese!"}
{"text":"So, at this point, I have had the Pastrami, the Roast Beef and most recently: THE CORNED BEEF!!! OMG the corned beef! Where have they been hiding this most special of deli meats? I have come to the conclusion that my initial sandwich experience was actually with the corned beef, not the Roast Beef. The Roast Beef is good too, but the Corned Beef was my true love from the start. Good Latkes too."}
{"text":"I purchased a corned beef on rye there yesterday.  It was appallingly bad.  It was dry and tough with the bread being over baked.   I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh lacks a true deli scene, smallman deli makes up for it

If you're looking for a Reuben or Rachel, go here"}
{"text":"Smallman Street Deli makes the ideal pickle spears; crisp, cold, ivory on the inside, Kosher as the universe is wide. Without one, your sandwich is lonely, your lunchpail left wanting...

Something occurred to me when I had one of SSD's amphibian-green obelisks with a sandwich the other day; I myself had been bereaved of something and was unaware of it for my entire life. That was until the sound of that pickle's first crunch bounced off of my teeth, its brining juices tickling as they trickled down my throat. 

Now I am full of sorrow knowing that the brownbag lunches of my tomorrows will never be truly great without a lance of that cured, salty, chilly cucumber to complete and complement the daily noontime, picnic bench ensemble."}
{"text":"I wanted to believe the good reviews. The food was nothing special and a bit overpriced. But the staff. Wow. They seemed disgruntled and generally unhappy. The lady on register who seemed distracted when I was ordering was botching orders all over the place. As I sat through a 30 minute lunch I heard 3 tables correct the wait staff on their order once it arrived. 

I ordered fries as a side and she bellowed \"I need a small fry\" to the grill. She then asked if I did want small fries. I said sure, small is fine. Since the order was already bellowed why break their rhythm. 

The kicker was when the fries didn't come. I told the waitress when she brought my burger (the special that day). She said \"okay\" and went to retrieve them. She returned to doubt my story of even ordering fries, first asking if I remembered how much I paid. (Yeah, I'm going to try to scam fries from this place). I reached to my jacket to get my receipt to check but it wasn't in my pocket, realizing I was essentially being called a liar I then just said \"forget it\". The waitress said \"no, don't worry\", and left. She came back a few minutes later to tell me she found the order and I was right. (Good to know I'm not a thief I guess.) 

Once my burger was nearly gone and I was 20 minutes into my lunch out came the disputed fries. They were hot and looked far better than the burger, but I was over it. The waitress offered to put them in a box. Yeah, how delightful would they be in about an hour or so, or maybe tomorrow? Mmmm. Are you serious?

To her credit the cashier came around and did apologize half heartedly. I assume she disputed my claim of undelivered fries in front of her boss or something. Either way it was classless and insulting. 

The place likely survives lunch due to very little competition. I walked out past all the Best of Pittsburgh banners thinking the whole city must be bereft of decent service. I know that's not true though."}
{"text":"It's just plain good!  Whether you like a hot pastrami on rye or a plain ol' turkey sandwich this deli is the real deal!  Large portion sizes, free refills on soda, and the friendliest staff around.  Daily specials are a bargain and my own personal recommendation...the Reuben and the turkey Rachel are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I am practically a weekend regular at Smallman, so I may be a bit biased but this is the best equivalent of a Shapiro's Deli in Indy that I could find it Pittsburgh. I usually order the combo of a corned beef on rye with matzo ball soup. It's sort of my PGH comfort food."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are seriously huge here. And delicious. Between my husband and I we've had most of the meats, and we've never been disappointed. Nice toppings and bread too.

If we get fries--and they are good fries--we always share a small because it is big and we are so full from the huge sandwiches.

The staff is wonderful too. They seem like they truly love their job. They will tell you all about the meats and give you recommendations. They're happy to bring things to you and always smiling.

This is not a discount deli. You do pay for the deliciousness. However, I think the portions are very generous. Perhaps if you don't have an enormous appetite, consider sharing a sandwich with a friend.

The cookies are delicious too."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is hands down the best place I've eaten in Pittsburgh.  Best sandwich of my life.  EAT HERE!!!  If you only go to one place in Pittsburgh let this place be it.  Primanti has NOTHING on smallman."}
{"text":"So, just had one of the worst breakfast meals I've ever had!  I don't complain often and not very picky about most things, but this was just bad!  It's pretty hard to f*ck up some breakfast, but they did it lol.  I looove bacon and think it should bend and not break.  I understand sometimes bacon is served crispy, but this was just overcooked and poorly prepared.  Even the small parts of the bacon that weren't burnt and still had normal bacon look/color were crunchy as hell and tasteless!  Maybe that's how they roll bacon wise, idk!  I'm well aware that some restaurants precook bacon and warm it up on the grill before serving, but my bacon was only greasy and never appeared to be warm.  Same thing with the toast, was not warm at all!  Seemed like it was in the toaster hours ago and was hard as hell.  The eggs seemed poured and not cracked.  The only thing half decent was the home fries.  
I guess that's what I get for ordering a basic breakfast at a place known for it's deli-style sandwiches lol.  I should've went with my first choice of sandwich.  On a positive note, every sandwich I've had here in the past was pretty good.  Just dont order the Murray Ave. Special or whatever they call it.  So I guess  for now until my next visit..."}
{"text":"I tend to forget / decide my hot mess morning look takes precedent to eating breakfast prior to leaving for work.  Smallman is within walking distance of my office so that's a win.  

A few times I've walked in around 10:40 and asked for an egg sandwich.  The woman behind the counter gets a really serious look on her face and states they stop serving breakfast at 10:30. Mind you the place is empty. (It gets packed round noonish).  

She then slowly turns around and with great flair asks the guy slicing meat if he is okay with cooking an egg.  He is fine with it and doesn't give two sh$ts.  She,however, is a stickler for breakfast rules.  Much respect.  Order your eggs before 10:30.

Lunch options are consistently good albeit a little pricey."}
{"text":"I think Rachel C's post below sums up the deliciousness of this deli.  So I will echo her thoughts and simply say that this deli is legit.

The corned beef and pastrami sandwiches are juicy, decadent, meaty, piled sky-high, and equal to (if not better) than many New York delis.  Amazing!

The chicken noodle soup warms the soul with lots chicken breast and vegetables.  And the noodles are plentiful, not soggy, and do not dominate the cup (you know what I mean).  

Yay to a great NY style deli in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Ordered a pastrami Reuben and it was the best I've ever had. Like others have said, it was huge, there was a lot of meat. However the balance of meat and sauerkraut was just right. Best of all, the sauce didn't overwhelm the sandwich. The second half of the sandwich even tasted great the next day although it was a little dry since I warmed it up in the microwave. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I live in squirrel hill, and order take out often. 

The burgers and fries are to die for when they're made right.... As often as I eat here, I guess I would recognize the hiccups, but that's unusual. Every so often, the meat used to make the burgers tastes/smells funny... I was so disappointed the last time, because I got home and the burger was bad... I had to throw it away... 

My boyfriend likes the matzoh-ball soup and the grilled cheese sandwiches as well. The turkey burgers are pretty good (never had a bad one)."}
{"text":"Sorry but this was the weirdest and ickiest matzoh ball soup ever imbibed by me.  Broth was just broth and practically white - like miso soup.  I think it was extremely watered down boullion from a cube.

Matzoh balls had green flakes in them (parsley?) and tasted like...uck I don't want to remember!

This was not chicken soup for the soul!

Two stars instead of one because sandwiches all smelled and looked good.  I might return to try one, but then again with all those great Italian hoagies nearby..."}
{"text":"I got a corned beef rueben and a side of lodtka. The sandwich was delicious, fresh rye and superb corned beef. It also had the right amount of 1000 Island dressing, which was more than a dab but not enough to soak the bread. The potato pancakes were good as well, crisp, though I could tell they were reheated. Not too dissappointed, but if they were dropped in the fryer to heat up again they would have been even better. Will definitely be there again for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Matzo balls and corned beef and latkes! Oh my! My taste buds and belly and soul were equally satisfied! The soup was Jewish Grandma delicious! Perfect broth, fluffy balls, and a handful of noodles for good measure. The corned beef (ordered extra lean for me) was tender, moist, and flavorful. It was served (as requested) with deli mustard on crusty and flavorful rye bread. It was the sandwich we Jewish girls dream of.... and to get it outside of New Yawk was a wonderful surprise. The latkes were fried to perfection and had the perfect ratio of potatoes to onions. And then, not that I needed it, I had a Black and White Cookie for dessert. Now.... I've had many of those pastries of diversity (ha!) in my life... but this was maybe the best. Tender cake-like cookie with the perfect amount of chocolate and vanilla frosting. It was the perfect ending to a heavenly meal!"}
{"text":"This is a great deli and a gem in Squirrel Hill. I love everything from the Rachel to their grilled cheese to their fresh cut fries to their amazing mile high cakes. If you're looking for a quick and delicious sandwich spot, look no further!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to order lunch to go.  

I ordered a reuben, which was good, but I found the prices to be a bit skewed on the high side for what you receive.  

Overall I got what I wanted, but I don't know how often I would be back."}
{"text":"I've found them to be overpriced for what you get; the sandwiches are ok but not particularly remarkable, and I think that description suits the rest of their menu fairly well, too."}
{"text":"Oh Reuben...Oh Rachel.... 

What's going on here?! 

Nothing...just makin sweet sweet love to my sammies! 

For reals though, so freakin' good!  The Reuben's are packed full of delicious roast beef, sauerkraut and just enough thousand island dressing to top off this amazing sandwich.  I always feel slightly guilty when ordering this because I know that big time calories are involved, but whilst spending a magical moment eating it, the calorie count just floats away! 

And my namesake (really...maybe??) the Rachel is equally as magical with the turkey and coleslaw! 

I haven't even gotten to the sides yet!  Of course the coleslaw is fantastic (dah, Reuben magic!) and being an incredibly stern judge on potato salads, this one passes the test with flying colors...er...seasonings!  Potato's aren't too mushy, good amount of mayo and the right seasonings. 

I can't forget the chili!  I had a couple weeks in the winter where I'd stop in every week and grab some.  It's REALLY fantastic!  I love thick chili with a melted layer of cheddar cheese on top.  Just thinking about it makes me all warm inside! 

The ONLY thing I'm not into is the prices.  It's no cheap deli.  More like a gourmet deli, if there is a such a thing.  I think I just add on the gourmet to justify the prices!  If the food was crappy, I would think twice.  The food saves them on the price end! 

Keep the good food train rollin and add on one of their enormous chocolate chip cookies or brownies. They're obviously freshly baked and totally worth the splurge.  I mean, hey, calorie smalorie!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Matzah ball soup is blah. Chicken noodle soup blah with oddly mushy noodles. Messed up orders. Overrated."}
{"text":"Buy the corned beef, swiss cheese, seeded rye, potatoe pancakes, and motza ball soup. Yum."}
{"text":"Oh, yum. I used to go to the one on Smallman ALL the time when I worked in the Strip. I order a grilled ham and swiss on sourdough. It's frakkin good. I was told that they must grill with a lot of Whirl. I hear it's some margarine type thingy, probably loaded with trans fat. Bring it on, Smallman Street Deli! Are you listening NYC? You can suck on your draconian no trans fat laws!

I've also had a delightful grilled cheese with just the right crispiness, and a lovely cheeseburger. They only make their burgers well done, and you probably want to remind them if you want your bun toasted.

Their prices are a little steeper than what I'd like from a Deli - I think the grilled cheese hits $6. But the food is tasty."}
{"text":"So, I'm heading to Mineos on Murray Ave. in Squirrel Hill for my pretty standard hangover cure (2 slices and 2 cokes), when I happen to see the \"SMALLMAN STREET\" deli on Murray Ave.  Now, I used to visit the smallman street deli on smallman street in the strip district religously when I lived a couple of blocks away, but haven't been by in years.  I was pleasantly surprised to see this deli located in another part of town.  I immediately park in the automotive packed traffic jungle that is murray ave. on a weekend and head over.  I pass a subway restaurant that is jam packed with folks jamming down $5 footlongs with maybe the best deli in pittsburgh literally two doors down.  I'm assuming this one is pretty much the same as the one in the strip meaning it's basically a take out place with a couple hightops, but not meant for sit down meals.  It already has a plus than the original because this one is open today (Sunday).  I walk in and their are the coolers to my left with lots of great deli meats and specialty cheeses and a counter straight ahead where to place my order.  The menu items are posted on a chalkboard above the counter.  I order a hot pastrami signature sandwich served on rye with dark mustard, a cup of matzah ball soup and a scoop of chicken liver (I know, I most likely jewish in a former life... Don't get me started on lox).  I look to my right and to my surprise there is ample booth and table seating with a couple of TV's with NFL on.  Awesome, I can actually sit down read the paper and watch tv... Then, I see something that is another revelation.  They have a cooler full of bottles of beer and a sign that says something to the effect of help yourself... Now, this is getting good I can even have a beer with lunch.  This is much better than the original location.  The waitress brings my food in less than 5 minutes.  The matzah soup is piping hot with a delicious broth and a softball sized matzah ball.  The soup is a hit.  The sandwich is fantastic.  The rye bread is great quality and the dark mustard rich and flavorful.  The pastrami is warm and packed with tons of flavor.  It's a big sandwich, but not so big that I need to use a knife and fork.  They have like a super signature sandwich that has over a lb. of meat, but that would violate my dont' eat anything as big as your head rule.  It does have a bit of gristle on it, but that's what I prefer (however, for $1 more you can get \"lean\" pastrami).  The chicken liver was kind of meh'.  It didn't really have any seasoning or chopped egg.  I only put a little bit on the sandwich.  The tomatoes and lettuce on the side had also seen better days.  The total cost of the meal NOT including a bottle of domestic beer was about $15, so it's a little pricey compared to subway subs, but I believe a good value.  They cure all of their meats at their strip district location.  I was a bit confused with respect to the tipping aspect with this place.  You don't really have a typical waitress situation.  You place your order at the counter, grab your own drinks and outside of bringing you your food you don't see her again.  Some tipped nothing I noticed and some tipped little (5%).  I chose to tip almost as much as I would at a typical restaurant, but not quite 20%.  This was a great new discovery for me... and maybe, a new hangover cure."}
{"text":"Easily the best deli in Pittsburgh, eating here takes me straight back to the epic sandwiches at the Carnegie deli in manhattan.  Massive portions of fresh mouth watering slabs of cold cuts with your choice of a wide variety of free toppings.  I particularly recommend the rueben, pastrami or tongue sandwich.  A bit pricey, but well worth since you can split one of their monster sandwiches with a friend and still have left overs!"}
{"text":"Stopped today for lunch with my daughter and as usual we were not disappointed. I have been a regular customer for about 4 years and have never had a bad meal. Today was a little different in that the regular cook was off sick and the manager was behind the grill cooking so service was a little slow. Not one word of complaint. Had the pastrami on rye with a bowl of chicken noodle soup. daughter had egg salad on sour dough both very large portions and we weren't disappointed. Good parking behind the restaurant and very convenient to get to"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place.  Their menu is extensive and I just love their pastrami sandwich.  My friend ordered a regular American burger and he said it was good as well.  The dining area is big and comfortable."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is the food is awesome.
The only reason I'm writing this review is that the boy who thinks he's really cool at the register is so obviously in love with himself I wanted to warn people who might enter this establishment thinking he will give you anything but a slightly annoyed, way too pretentious attitude.
He barely looked at me as I was the only person there at around 430 on a Monday afternoon. I put in my order, two dinners, while he gave off the friendliness of a fucking toad. 
I needed to find a place in the area that sold magazines, and thought he might redeem himself and help me out. He stared at me lethargically, shrugged his shoulders (the most emotion I'd seen from him) and said. \"I dunno. I don't read magazines.\"
Welp, let's hope that your do read yelp reviews, dude. You being apathetic about your job doesn't make you cooler. I mean, i get that being asked if latkes come with the meal a million times a day can get a bit maddening, but it t is what it is. 
I base 90%of returning to a business on customer service. This place needs some improvement in that department."}
{"text":"Twice in the last two months I have had Smallman Street Deli cater events for me. The first, a dinner party for family was so successful that I had them cater the break fast dinner after Yom Kippur.  Dealing with the deli was a pleasure. They knew exactly what I needed and streamlined the ordering process.  When I picked up the food, the staff was meticulous in going through the order with me and making sure it was perfect.  The trays looked beautiful and professional.  Everyone agreed that all of the fish was the best ever. But equally delicious were the perfectly ripe sweet tomatoes and the fruit platter.  The trays were packed so full that we could have served twice as many people. The vegetable frittata was outstanding as well.  I've never catered this event before but always will do so in the future. Smallman made everything easy and gave us a terrific value."}
