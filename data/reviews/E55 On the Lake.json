{"text":"This place is run by the Cleveland Metroparks.  It's on the East 55th Street marina. East parking in their shared parking lot.  They added a new patio with an outdoor bar.  The view is great and the food is good.  Our server was really friendly and attentive.  They also have sand volleyball courts and some days have bands playing."}
{"text":"Great food and drink and laid back atmosphere. Mary was friendly and the pickles were amazing"}
{"text":"Menu here sucks. They need a menu like the other Metroparks location Merwhins Wharf with salmon & ribs. Also, the service is so damn slow at the outside bar. The bathrooms here are disgusting."}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice enough here - sitting outside, close to the water, within view of the city... but the execution of it all left much to be desired. We were slow to receive service and when the food arrived, I was brought a veggie melt instead of a veggie burger (which I ordered without cheese, so I'm still confused why it got confused with a melt). I told the waitress and she let me know I had received it because I ordered the \"veggie burger\" not \"black bean burger\" and she didn't know those were the same thing.      Eek. 

The manager took the meal off of our bill because we didn't have time to stay for them to make me a new order. We experienced a few other small mistakes (wrong salad, empty water cups, etc), but would go back. I'll go back if I have plenty of time to eat, and I\"ll also make sure to order the \"black bean burger.\""}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch while in town for business. Very nice setting on the lake. 
happy crew, nice salad, quick.
I will return!!
No traffic or parking issues!! Didn't even know this was here but thanks to Yelp, found it."}
{"text":"If you are visiting the city or driving through on I 90 East Shoreway, you must give this little restaurant a try. No driving through the city. Just get off the Marginal exit and you are there.

Best view of the lake. You are actually sitting beside the Lake. No other restaurant in the city has a view like this. Amazing. Hidden treasure.

Other establishments charge you and arm and a leg for a view like this!!! 

Food is on point! Best blackened fish sandwich in Cleveland. Perfection x 10. Sweet potato fries  and slaw were equally good. Menu is small, but the flavors are big.  Prices are affordable."}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem today. Enjoyed lunch outside. The view is beautiful!!! The food was great (I thought the menu had the perfect options!), prices were reasonable, and service was excellent.  They have beer and mixed drinks available. And the patio is dog friendly. The women's bathroom was clean and in good shape. This might be my new favorite place in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"First time there this evening.
Sat at the bar with friends.
Servers must of been trained
Not to engage in eye contact 
with customers. Definitely, no team work
Unfriendliness & unprofessional bar & food servers.
So sad, people that work in the food industry 
Are so unhappy & miserable they can't even fake a smile...."}
{"text":"Small restaurant located on the Marina. Excellent sangria and cold beer. I didn't even know it was here."}
{"text":"Nice spot to have a few drinks on a nice summer day. The food is OK but it's basically bar food. The portion sizes are good and the BBQ potato skins were delicious. I also saw someone try the shrimp po boy which looked very tasty. Good music, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice little place to enjoy a quick bite or a cocktail while enjoying activities on the shores of Lake Erie.  Split a  Grilled Veggie Melt $9 Grilled zucchini, portabella mushroom and roasted red pepper on thick sliced bread with provolone cheese and basil mayo, which was quite tasty.  Added on the fresh cut fries for $2.  Also got the chicken tender kid's meal with fries.  The chicken tenders seemed to be the same product that the  golden arches uses for their chicken nuggets, only formed into a tender.  Would pass on those in the future.
I eyed the other tables choices and the turkey Reuben looked great and a popular choice.
Beach decor was the focus here and a great view of the lake. There are maybe a dozen tables and also had a small bar with seating.  A band schedule was posted featuring live music on Saturday nights.  I also saw a sand volleyball court outside and patio seating.
The server was very attentive and was hustling. 
All in all a nice little break spot to relax.
