{"text":"CK's BBQ is off the charts best BBQ I have EVER eaten!!! The owner Keith was a great guy and said he is at Gold Mine Tavern in Henderson most weekends and does private catering! Will definitely be coming here on the weekends and booked him to cater a party for me already!! If you like BBQ and great service then CK's is a must do!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to their burgers, but it wasn't available this time around. However! I did try the pork sandwich and tri-tip sandwich. You can literally taste the smoky goodness that anything BBQ should entail in their food! But its not overbearing at all. The sandwiches had a helping coleslaw in them, and perhaps something like their special sauce. Meat from both sandwiches were tender and flavorful. You will be satisfied when ordering from this food truck! Staff is awesome too! They are patient and willing to give suggestions if you feel indecisive. You also have the option of adding a side to your order as well.

When I came by, they were parked right in front of the Gold Mine bar. Once you have ordered and get your food, you are more than welcome to sit at the open patio seating at Gold Mine (pretty sure they partner up with each other). Loved the experience, and enjoyed the tasty bbq!"}
{"text":"Love!! CK is an awesome guy and makes even better food! I've had almost everything on the menu and it doesn't disappoint. CK has great customer service, I look for his truck whenever I go to a foodie fest!"}
