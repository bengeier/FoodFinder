{"text":"C'est si Bon is a Korean restaurant in Montreal that serves some pretty mean cuisine. My bf, who is Korean, noted delightfully that he felt the food here reflected what he used to have back in Seoul. We had ssam with bulgoli, green peppers, rice, and other vegetables as the fillings.  Our party also had a large pot of miso soup, which I found to be rather watery in flavour.  However, the soup appealed to many in our party (personal preference I guess).  You do get side dishes, which I find as a standard now in all Korean restaurants I go to as they help to whet your appetite.  Here, they consist of potatoes, marinated bean sprouts, tofu skins and kimchi.  The potatoes were to die for since they were so crispy they were akin to home fries. 

Also, the restaurant keeps up an atmosphere that is ''in trend''.  Due to the release of Avengers, they decorated their chalkboard with Iron Man. This is definite plus one in my books.

Lastly, the servers here speak fluent Korean and English, so it's very tourist-friendly.  Come out here if you're craving Korean grub during your next visit to Montreal!"}
{"text":"KARAOKE! 

Ever since I dabbled in the art of karaoke back at the Yelp Christmas party (those of you who know are the MVP's) I've been destined to go back.  

One of Adam's friends knew about this place and so we went as a group. It's 30$ for a private room and they are verrrrry nice. You have large couches, tambourines, an extensive song book and you can be as loud as you want! You can bring your drinks inside the room as well.  

They have songs in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese as well. 

The kitchen closes at 10-11ish so I didn't get anything to eat but I wasn't there to eat anyway! They have a smaller more snacky menu at night. 

Adam got a beer and it's so cool how they serve it on a little light pedestal. 

The staff is really nice too. They dance and sing along with you. Every Tuesday the whole bar karaoke's, not just the private rooms. 

We had a really fun night! I definitely recommend this place for a night of eating, singing, and dancing."}
