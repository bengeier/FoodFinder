{"text":"Okay, so for the past 10 years I've been craving...longing for patties and let me tell you it was well worth the wait! I am in love! The service and food are superb! When I pulled up, the aroma of goodness smacked me in the face, oooooh my goodness! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Caribbean restaurant. Miss Martha and her crew are so lovely and  welcoming. The food is superb and large portions for a great price. Bring your appetite and your patience, as great food is not made fast. We had a group of five and were in and out within 1 1/2 hours. You can call ahead and they will reserve space for you or you can always get takeout.

They have a wonderful market next door with lots of different spices and goodies. Miss Gloria is always available if you have any questions.

I love bringing visitors from out of town to eat here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having Caribbean food not sure what to compare it to it was decent I just had their salad with rice and beans the rice and beans were okay little different flavor it had a earthy flavor to it the sound was a little clean lettuce tomato cucumber not much else definitely go back again for something different and they smoke their me outside which smelled great and the people are very nice"}
{"text":"So I was hungry and I happened to arrive at Caribbean Market Restaurant when they offered a Pork Chop special.  
Oh My God !!!  The pork chops were out of this world, fork tender, meaty and delicious.

Accompanied with Rice&Peas and steamed vegetables it was the best home cooked style meal I had in a very long time.

I hope they keep offering this plate.  I will come running when the do."}
{"text":"So delighted to find a Caribbean grocery store and kitchen in the West valley. I came across an ad for this place a few days ago at my hairdresser and went to try it today. I was like a kid going up and down the aisles, putting hard to find items like salt fish, sorrel, kola champagne, jerk seasoning, plantain chips and ovaltine biscuits into my basket. It was such a treat to find Caribbean groceries that I had to order online before I knew of Caribbean Market Place. It is a small store but take your time going through...I was surpised at the selection.

After chatting with the lady who rang me up, I learned that the Caribbean Market Place grocery store has been there for 6 years, but they recently opened the kitchen which is adjacent. There are a couple of tables inside and outside, but we opted for an order to go. A generous plate of curry chicken, rice and peas and plantains was $10, oxtail stew with the same sides was $13. VERY good meal! My curry chicken was enough for lunch and dinner...my Dad enjoyed his oxtail with plantains.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best JA food in the valley. Great hot food at the restaurant and lots of goodies in the grocery. Friendly vibe and good music."}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday afternoon for the first time and as soon as I walked in the door there was a line. I took that as a good sign because the food must be real good if people are willing to wait. I ended up waiting more than 15 - 20 minutes by the time my order was taken; which was okay because I wasn't in a rush. I was just happy to finally get my hands on some Jamaican food again being that it's so scarce out here. I ordered a plate of oxtails, rice and peas with plantains. First thing that surprised me was the price, $15 for the plate and a bottled drink was $2.25. But, I didn't worry about that since I was hungry and looking forward to eating some real food. Well, by the time I sat down to eat it was a bit underwhelming. Being that I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY I have had many plates of Jamaican food in my lifetime and this one just didn't quite cut it for me. The portion size was good, but it just wasn't as tasty as the previous reviews made it out to seem. It's possible that this was just an off day so I may go back and try one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I live 30 mi away but I try to go every week. Authentic food made fresh. You can eat in or get in to go. Jerk chicken, jerk ribs, curry goat, oxtails, patties (beef, chicken and veggie) and much more. Their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find beef patties and this restaurant really delivered. I was sad that they ran out, but blessed to have the last one. So worth it. My hubby had the ox tail with rice and Beans and potato salad. I will be going back and trying thwhole menu. My only advice is keep those beef patties by the bulk so we can take some home and share with family and friends. Thank you for the yummy food! 


Great Job!

PS: wanted to take a picture of the Beef Patty. It was so good, it did not make it"}
{"text":"my favorite Caribbean eatery. ive eaten here several times and food is consistently good. only downside are the prices i feel the price points are $1-5 too high and im basing this on the prices in new york  which is odd since owners are paying double and triple the rents of Arizona."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this Caribbean market/restaurant. They had everything we were looking for. Customer service was extremely pleasant. The food tasted good. The only criticism I have is that they should give a little bit more food."}
{"text":"Jerk ribs and oxtail stew are amazing. 
Frendly staff and they have a grocery store where u can pick up items to cook at home.."}
{"text":"Oh MY!!! Had to make a U-turn to come back and get me something to eat! The food is amazing . The staff is amazing and very friendly too. Yes I will be a regular at this beat keep secret!"}
{"text":"Brown stew chicken was MWAH! Wanted to kiss the cook, but that would be innapropriate ;)  I went late at night so I wasn't expecting the food to be fresh but it was flavorful, the sauce was rich and the sides were sweet in contrast to the fire of the spices.  Nice array of west indian spices and seasonings in the store as well.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite carribean Restuarant in Phoenix. Ms Martha always holds it down with the food. Pricey but definitely worth it with the generous portions. Patty & coco bread are a nice start if you're unsure of what to get. Jerk wings and ribs are to die for!! I'm here like once a week and I've yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So much flavor, so so good! Had the jerk chicken with ox tail gravy on my rice and beans."}
{"text":"Lo and behold, all this time I've been spelling Caribbean wrong.  No wonder I can never find it!  It's 1 R and 2 B's.  1 R and 2 B's.  1 R and 2 B's.  Okay - 

If you find yourself straying westward one afternoon, stop for lunch at the Caribbean Marketplace on 44th Av & W Northern.  The restaurant is expanding to include more dining space.  I am rooting for it's success.  With expansion, I'm hoping to see more organization and a better use of the displays. 

Overall friendly atmosphere; nice ambiance in the restaurant with music to keep rhythm to.  I'm fond of the tall wood tables and chairs.  They add class to the cheap looking tile floor.  The grill outside was hot, but empty so I presume they only grill upon order. 

The grocery store is small with a few packed aisles.  I saw a bit of everything.  If you need something - ask.  Numerous folks came through to pick up one or two things or just out of curiosity, so this spot is pulling in a good crowd. 

Meanwhile, back in the restaurant, I was happy to have a tall serving of homemade sorrel.  Oh yes, yes, that takes me back....Prepared to wait for the snapper (made to order) I also enjoyed a veggie patty of corn, carrots, and cabbage.  It was the classic veggie patty that I remembered from my other life.  

What I wasn't happy about was the lack of green vegetation on the menu.  Oxtails, chicken, goat, patties (beef, chicken, veggie), coco bread, plantains (way too oily!), rices & peas, pasta salad, and potato salad were readily available.  Where were the greens, callaloo, okra?

Nonetheless, my order of snapper was beautifully prepared with bell peppers and onions.  Yummy.  The cook allowed the veggies to flavor the dish and did not rely on a heavy hand of salt.  I will def come to the Caribbean (1 R, 2 B's) Marketplace again and I do recommend that you stop by too.  

Call ahead 623-930-5258 to see what else the cook can prepare."}
{"text":"Regular customers in the market section for grocery items since this store first opened for business. We  decided to feed our faces, we ordered the curry goat, stewed chicken and oxtail. The food was finger licking good. \"Di food irie mon\""}
{"text":"Love it closest ting to mums food..  Good home cooked food..  The people are good the food has just as much personality as the chef so you know its AMAZING"}
{"text":"If you hail from the Caribbean as I am and you're looking to stock up on any kind of item from back home that'll make you nostalgic, then this is the place for you.

Let me know start, the place is located in a small strip mall and wasn't hard to find with my GPS.  The sign outside was large enough to see from far.  
Parking is more than generous.  The outside of the establishment is clean.  

As you enter, I was greeted by the friendly employees.  On the left is the grocery side and on the right is the restaurant side with some tables and chairs for eating.

On this particular visit, we found everything we were looking for that couldn't be found at any local grocery store, Walmart, or Target.  We picked up curry and saffron powder, cooking butter, a soft drink called 'Solo', poulourie mix, and a jar of mango chutney all produced in our homeland - Trinidad and all reasonably priced may I add!

While we were there, we figured we'd grab a bite to eat so I ordered the regular curry goat which comes with 2 sides so I chose the rice and beans along with the fried plantains which was very tasty and served hot!  Thankfully the curry goat wasn't too spicy.  The regular is $`13 and was enough for two or maybe if you leave any leftovers, it can go for dinner tonight but I consumed it all.
One of the food items we came for was roti but they were out but will be retuning in a couple days for it....it's a must have!

We were really pleased to have found this place through the internet and Yelp and seeing as they carry many of the products that are so hard to find in our local neighborhood markets and groceries, we will definitely be returning, not just for that roti, but for many other grocery items!"}
{"text":"Want a part of the islands, this is the place to go. Chef Patrick definitely puts his heart in his food.  My favorite is the curry goat and jerk chicken.  Authentic flavors with a chef to match! They also have a little market so you can take the ingredients home and try your hand at this marvelous cuisine."}
{"text":"Great service the people working in there are very nice we eat here at least once a week the food is amazing full of flavors and always fresh definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"They have the best Jamaican food in Glendale! Big plates priced very good for all the food they give you. Sweet fresh plantains delicious jerk rub everything was just so good this is the only Jamaican spot I'll eat at in Glendale"}
{"text":"Great food I was looking for a place to have Caribbean food that was not very spicy ad have indigestion all night. This place was perfect. I like the clean bathrooms as well as restaurant. There is every kind of Caribbean sodas and my food was hot and didn't take long to get my food. will return again soon."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Five star restaurant plating, flavors and colors!!! I enjoy myself every time. This is a hidden gem of Phoenix. It's a must try don't be discouraged/intimidated by the neighborhood. The staff is friendly and the chef is TALENTED and ready to show off his skills!!!! Delicious!!!"}
