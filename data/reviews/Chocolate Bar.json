{"text":"Food was good and definitely had lots of tasty looking desert options. I got the sweet potatoes fries and they were very good especially with the three different kinds of dipping sauces. I also got the Bella sandwich which was nicely done although I wish I would've been told that the side is potato chips... I would've rather swapped it out for something else"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. Not worth the money. Or time. I had a Apple and Goat cheese salad. The amount of goat cheese on the salad was about half a teaspoon - and used as \"glue\" to hold the apples together in a design in the middle of the salad. As for the dessert... I expected the desserts to be FANTASTIC. I had the Peanut Butter Mud and my friend had the Oreo Mud. Both tasted old and freezer/fridge burned. Pass. This. Place. Up."}
{"text":"nice place. service was just okay. martinis are too rich to finish a whole one by yourself. prices match the area, but it was just okay."}
{"text":"We didn't get a chance to sit because we had a long day and they were super crowded by the time we got down there. There were multiple events happening in downtown on Saturday Sept.17 2016. I did order the New York style cheese cake to take home which was tasty and the Flourless Chocolate Cake. It was surprisingly good although made with no flour. They took our take home orders right away and they were very pleasant. Our foodie tour of Cleveland's restaurants started at 10 am and it ended here on Sept. 17 2016 close to 8:50 pm. The Chocolate Bar is a full service restaurant and they have the reputation of putting chocolate in a lot of their recipes. Like Douglas MacArthur.......WE SHALL RETURN. ;-)"}
{"text":"Nice place. All we has was dessert but it was very yummy. Clean restaurant and friendly, quick service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience in Cleveland. 
While we did find a delicious raspberry truffle martini at this restaurant, we also found uninterested staff who couldn't seem to care less whether we were there, seated us at a table next to the register and a table of employees rather than anywhere in the empty space on the lower level (I felt like I was eating in an employee lounge with all the staff coming by their table to chat), a freezing dining room, a chipped plate under my lunch, and incredibly bland food. All in all, 5 minutes inside the door and we couldn't wait to leave. The menu looked great, but the execution was disastrous. I ordered their white chocolate pasta assuming that since it was a specialty (one of only 2 or 3 entrees including chocolate) that it would be something special. I was absolutely wrong and the pasta was cold and had no taste-no amount of salt or pepper at the table was going to help that. My friend ordered a chicken pesto sandwich and it was obvious to her that the chicken hadn't been seasoned at all when it was cooked. According to her the sandwich was better without the chicken. We were so disappointed that we couldn't even make ourselves stay to try dessert. Our waiter (who barely spoke to us) brought our check and acted as if I'd asked him to bring me the moon when I asked him to split the check and split the martini we ordered between us. He still didn't get it right when he brought it back, but by then we didn't have the patience to ask him to try again. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My family and I have tried the Chocolate Bar several times now, hoping that we'll have a good experience. It just hasn't happened. 

The service is often rude and distracted, even when there are very few customers. The food? Well, frankly, it's atrocious. I ordered a caesar salad (hard to hurt right?) and it came with no dressing and a sad mix of rusted and wilted greens. The french onion soup had cheese, it just wasn't melted; which is pretty much the whole point of french onion soup.

My son's grilled cheese sandwich (also pretty hard to hurt), was cold, and the cheese tasted like plastic.

If you do choose to risk the food, order appetizers and salads because the portions are very small and overpriced.

If I ever go there again, which is doubtful, I'll stick to the deserts and maybe a chocolate martini. They do know how to make deserts; though too bad they're often served with a scowl by the grumpy staff."}
{"text":"VERY overrated place.  Have been a couple of times & the service is terrible.  We saw our server wipe her nose on her hands while delivering drinks to another table. Makes you wonder what the servers are doing before they bring out your food & drinks.  The martinis were nothing special & very over-priced.  You can get a chocolate martini practically anywhere, and pay less for it, too.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Rude, Rude and with a large side order of RUDE.

I was staying at the Hyatt which is in the same arcade, and decided that since it was late, I'd grab some dinner at Chocolate Bar.  Big mistake.  Besides the horrible \"NON GREETING\" at the door, the wait was way too long, the service was shoddy, and the attitudes of every single person working royally SUCKED.  I see from many other reivews here that I am not alone in that opinion.  Tried to speak to the manager on duty but no one would tell me who he or she was, even when I was insistent (i.e. I got mad).  

If this place didn't have the location it has, it would be out of business.  Totally crap.  Rotten service and attitude."}
{"text":"First impression was the place was unique and smelled delicious.  But that soon faded because the service was terrible (2 out of 10).  The drinks were outstanding though.  Had the chocolate dipped strawberry (8 out of 10).  The food was average, in that it was nothing special (6 out of 10).   If I could suggest to anyone.... I would say just go for the drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"The service sucked!!  During a night out with some friends we stopped in, what sounded like a cool little spot, to try a drink.  Sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by a waitress- JENNY.  She seemed less than thrilled, boarderline annoyed, as my friend noted she was feeling good after a couple of shots she had at another establishment.  My friend was by NO means wasted but rather attempting to be friendly and enjoying herself.  About one minute later after standing 2 feet away conversing with, whom I assume was the manager, she (the waitress) told my friend \"I dont feel comfortable serving you\"- then rather accusatory asked to see my other friends ID!  I would never return and am quite annoyed with this place!!  I completely understand the need to cut patrons off if they reach a particular limit, for everyones sake, but really Jenny after a 5 second interaction you evaluated this person and determined she was unable to be served.  Actually after reading through some of the reviews I would like to thank  JENNY from saving me 45/60 min of my time for habitual bad service and overpriced chocolate martinis that I quite frankly can get somewhere else!! And by the way we did go elsewhere and had a great time with exceptional service!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here on business and should have looked at the reviews before I strolled into this place. It looked promising, but it wasn't all that great. 

The chocolate martini was delicious, but other than that the food was mediocre; and expensive. Don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Our visit affirmed the quick and cheerful service other reviewers have mentioned. The atmosphere is friendly and upbeat, and the menu ranges from salads, sandwiches, and flatbreads to more expensive entrees. You'll be able to choose from among a good variety of chocolate martinis ($10 ea), as well as other drinks, and our server offered some spot-on recommendations when we told him our likes/dislikes. The martinis come thick and flavorful, with only a hint of an alcohol undertone. Well-made but rich and garnished with a chocolate straw, ours lasted each person through the entire meal and served as dessert with a cup of coffee at the end, too.

Unless you're uber-hungry, 3 people can easily share the generous order of potato fries, but they're reeeally good: thick-cut and served with 3 dipping sauces (maple mayo, rosemary butter, and a dark chocolate sauce), all perfect complements to the fries. 

Our entrees (the Bella and Ski Country sandwiches, and the Chocolate Bar Chicken Salad) all were nicely prepared and tasty, but the standouts here are the chocolate drink concoctions."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Myself and 5 others decided to go have brunch there today. When we arrived we waited 10 minutes for a table no big deal. When we sat down we each realized how dirty everything was. Two of us requested new silverware while 3 of us requested new glasses for our water. Each glass had lipstick marks while one had a white ring around the bottom of it as it appeared to be left over milk. We received our menus which were on basically an index size paper with 8 choices and it clearly said no substitutes and they meant it. You could not get anything except for the way it was printed on the menu. Then our waiter asked if we wanted drinks when he delivered them instead of putting them on a tray he literally stuck is fingers in them to carry 4 at a time. Needless to say we stood up and walk out and went to the Hyatt restaurant located in the same building and had a great brunch. Chocolate Bar is terrible!!!."}
{"text":"2 stars for decent food, drinks and ambiance.  After that it goes down hill.  The staff all seemed angry and/or sad.  I was cut off twice by waitstaff on my way to the restroom with stare downs (how dare you get in my way type of looks).  This place could really be a gem if the staff acted like they wanted to be there and had any level of waiting experience. The food could have been presented nicer and the brown 50/50 t shirts are just not classy.  Please get your act together so people have the experience they are looking for instead of just being a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"My family and I actually got up and left this restaurant after being seated by a very rude hostess. She was very condescending and short with us and clearly hated her job. We have heard good things about this place which is why we wanted to go; but unfortunately we couldn't get past the nasty staff member and will not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on our honeymoon. The service started out great and then we almost had to flag our server down. They didn't have any non-dairy options for milkshakes. The drinks we did get were pretty good tho. Will probably be back for the amazing cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"Wandered into Chocolate Bar on a Saturday night. Seemed like a very busy, happening little place. My party and I were just there for desserts--their specialty. I ordered sugar crepes with strawberries and they were a little tough. Couldn't cut them with a fork, had to wait for a waitress to ignore my request for a knife and for our waitress to finally bring me one. (She wound up bringing a steak knife--maybe she knows how tough the crepes are too). My mother ordered the Chocolate Explosion dessert which was big enough for two (or three) people to share. Her friend ordered a root beer float, which came with a tall side glass of root beer--how generous!! Overall, a decent but cliche establishment... very popular spot for bachelorette parties and groups of women who love chocolate. I'd say the clintele was 85% female... so this would be an excellent place to hang if you were a single male or if you like women."}
{"text":"I have been to The Chocolate Bar for special occasions and for that quick bite before a concert and have never been disappointed!!! The food is amazing and reasonably priced, the drinks are delicious and exceed all expectations! Our last visit was before the NKOTB concert and the manager put on NKOTB music and made the environment a great start to evening. This is my go to downtown restaurant and will be for a long long time!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. Not wheelchair accessible & in my case no stroller access. The chicken was bone dry and the crab cakes frozen. The whiskey was good tho"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and each time I am increasingly disappointed. As someone who's favorite food in the entire world is chocolate, you'd think it would be heaven, but this place manages to kind of butcher a good thing with poor service and a real lack of effort.

Chocolate Bar is not a place for people who love chocolate, it is a place for people who love spending too much money for an artsy plate with more design than actual sustenance. It makes for a great instagram, but not a great dessert.

My $8 dollar piece of flourless chocolate cake was smaller than my hand, and the glass of milk I ordered with it was warm and had lipstick stains on it. My friend's lava cake was just warm, with no lava in it. Our server corrected these things to the best of her ability but it genuinely just felt like the servers did not give a shit about working there and seemed pretty miserable. I've also had their regular food in the past and it always just pretty average.

It's a great location, good atmosphere, and can be a fun outing, but don't come expecting to be wowed by the food. I really hope they step up their game and start serving dessert for real people, because this place has so much potential."}
{"text":"Meh, for being exclusively a dessert place, was very very underwhelmed. The interior/décor was nice and classy, location was nice, and definitely nice service. But nothing on the menu will make me come back again. honestly, my wife prefer to get a nice school of ice cream from Mitchell's or malley's."}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch. The atmosphere is great... Food is ok... Biscuits and gravy, not so good... Portions are small... Mimosas for breakfast! Yum. A little slow on getting the food, but our waitress was nice..."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and had drinks, dinner,  and dessert at the bar. The bar staff was very attentive and friendly and the food and drinks were all great. I had the prime rib special and a few different martinis all of which were pretty and pretty tasty. The prices seemed reasonable coming from out of town from DC. I would definitely come back again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"It was okay. They ran out of the dessert I wanted so had to settle for a  chocolate cake that wasn't anything to rave about. I bought into the whole novelty!"}
{"text":"The chocolate items are more overly sweet than dark chocolate tasting, even though they are dark in color. I'm a chocoholic, been a couple times, but just sweet over real chocolate taste. It's a popular themed place for showers though."}
{"text":"Chocolate Bar is such a fun place. The martinis are incredible. My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. The Swedish fish is also really good! Fun place to relax and enjoy some sweet cocktails."}
{"text":"We both got salads to save room for dessert.

Seating: The table we first got put at had missing feet and rocked like a viking ship. It took us a while to get reseated, and then we got reseated at a tiny little coffee table. It looked like they had other seating available, so I was not completely happy with where we were.

Menu Design: This is going to seem like a really odd thing to get irritated by, but I found it off-putting that the menu listed ingredients separated by periods, not commas. I know it was just a device to separate them, but I feel like there are commas in addition to periods for a good reason. Yes, I'm being the grammar police here, but there's such a finality to a period, and. then. to. see. it. after. every. word?!

Entrees: The salads were decent. I got the Mediterranean which has grilled shrimp, grape tomatoes, artichoke hearts, olives, assorted greens, and feta cheese. My usual biggest complaint applies here: again the shrimp were marinated too salty.

Dessert: The Belgian Chocolate Mousse cake. I will say that this was very good: not too sweet, very rich chocolate flavor. It is also our waiter's favorite. I think the dessert really saves this review from getting 2 stars.

Service: a bit on the slow side ... I know I'm a big city girl, and this is Cleveland, so take that as you will."}
{"text":"Came here after years of our customers raving about it. We had appetizers, buffalo chicken salad, and ahi wrap. Got dessert to go. Lived up to the expectations."}
{"text":"Service and manager is horrible! I will never go here again. Besides the fact that the food and drinks were mediocre, the management is worse. My boyfriend ordered a chocolate mint martini, it was okay, he drank it and ordered the same thing again. This new one tasted different, I could taste something off about it from the previous one - too much mint or something. Even the color looked different. I kindly explained to the server that it did not taste okay. The manager came up to us a minute later and rudely told us that there \"is no way the martini could have been different\" and that \"the bartender never messes up\". He was incredibly rude and the drink, which we did not drink, was not taken off the bill. I was shocked at how I was treated by a manager in that restaurant. They should be out of business."}
{"text":"People, you don't go here for dinner...Desserts and Marinis.  The chocolate mint and chocolate dipped strawberry were awesome? I also loved the Nutella crepes."}
{"text":"Excellent drinks...the Chocolate Banana cream and pomegranate martinis were. delicious!! Food selection had variety and the pecan chicken was super good!! Steak made to order as well.  We had good service on a Sunday night during a Browns game. 
We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. We arrived and no one came to our table, not even for water, for a long time. We only got salads and eating there took over 2 hours. Then they charged us incorrectly. The food is good, but the staff needs trained or reorganized."}
{"text":"Brunch was very good. Waitress was very good. Reasonably priced. Prompt service. Will definitely go back and try their dinner menu. Would recommend"}
{"text":"We went last night for dinner and drinks before the Cavs game. Awesome. I had the T-Bone Steak Special, which was cooked and prepared perfectly. My family got the peppercorn steak which was also to die for, and the Berry Good Salad. Our drinks were awesome, service was attentive and the place is clean. I am looking forward to eating there again!

Total plus to be in walking distance of E4th and the Cavs!"}
{"text":"Randomly on a Friday night, the BF and I were invited to meet his dad for a night out in the CLE - dinner at Chocolate Bar and a Led Zeplin cover band concert at HOB.  I've been inside Chocolate, but never actually ate or drank here because it's always been slammed on the nights I'm there.

We met our party a little after they had already arrived, and I will say the seating in this place is a pretty cramped.  But we were greeted incredibly fast by our server to take our drink orders and while I'm usually a dirty martini girl, I figured I had to go for something sweet that night and ordered the Key Lime Pie martini (a personal fave).  The bf, not so much of a tini fan, ordered either beer or whiskey (or both, I can't remember).  My drink came faster than I had expected, given the large crowd, and was totally pleased with what was about to hit my lips.  This drink was pretty damn close to perfection - not too sweet, slightly tart, strong but not overbearing, and just the right amount of graham cracker crust on the rim.  That was, until I spilled it (after MAYBE 3 sips - sin, i know!).  Luckily I was able to save a good majority of the drink, but needless to say there was liquid - my delicious, sugary, alcoholic concoction, all over the table and ME (leather pants, I'll save you!).  Within seconds we were being handed napkins, our server came over with a towel, and the mess was gone before you can say \"I RUINED THOSE LEATHER PANTS!\".  

As for the food, 2 flat breads and 2 salads were ordered - all were good, but basically upscale bar food (if that's what you want to call it).  The menu has an interesting array of items (again, pretty typical upscale bar-fare), but I'll say that there's definitely something for everyone.  The pricing is decent, drinks and food, so you don't have to expect spending a gazillion dollars on a decent dinner.

This was a hard one for me to star, because the service and drinks were great, which I would totally give a 4-4.5, but the food wasn't anything to write home about and cramped dining space was a turnoff, bringing me down to the 3.  Overall, a good place with fantastic service that I don't see myself frequenting often but will definitely visit when I'm in the mood for one of those key lime pie martinis."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelorette party last weekend. It was not what I was expecting. First, I didn't realize it was a chain until we walked in the restaurant. But once inside, it was so obviously a chain. Everything about it felt forced. The drinks are *extremely* pricey ($10), considering that they don't seem to have any alcohol in them. Also, you have to pay extra ($13) for a regular martini instead of the sugar water that passes for their martini menu, which is nuts.  I don't think a $10 drink is that ridiculous, but not for Cleveland, and not for Chocolate Bar. The food was just sandwiches, salads, and flatbreads. There were some entrees that were a bit more, but even the filet minion was $16. What! Clearly, this is not high quality food. It's a weird dichotomy, considering the ridiculous price for the drinks, and how cheap the food is. The restaurant was crowded, the floors were slippery, the service was not great. I guess I just thought Chocolate Bar would be a nice restaurant, so when I walked into Applebee's with martinis I was surprised. There are so many better restaurants in the same area, I couldn't possibly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Given The Chocolate Bar three tries and 3 strikes they're out! Slow service and when I asked for something it seemed like and unconvinced. Saw our server standing my the bar repeatedly when he could have cleared our plates or asked for another drink. My dining partner for up and retrieved her own box after 20 minutes of waiting. Not happy and upset I wasted my time."}
{"text":"Drinks and food were good! We had reservations (which id recommend,  being its location) for my wife's birthday - they gave us an awesome view and had the table set and ready to go. We each ordered a flatbread and a few drinks, which were delicious! Service was a little slow, hence the 4/5 stars. Otherwise,  an awesome place to go!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Martini was good. Dessert was awesome! Only bad thing to say is to be located downtown Cleveland, they shouldn't have table right at the front door! IF YOU ARE MAKING RESERVATIONS FOR A LARGE GROUP DURING THE WINTER, DO NOT LET THEM SEAT YOU MY THE FRONT DOOR!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was insanely slow!!! Waited almost an hour for our food, and they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Cavs game. What a neat place to catch something sweet after having average arena food. The hot fudge sundae was pretty good and they were willing to through in a banana. Looked like lots of cocktail options, as well as an interesting dinner menu."}
{"text":"Came here after a Cav's game to keep the buzz going and grab some dessert. For drinks I had a wedding cake martini .. hands down the best martini I have ever had. It tasted like cake batter. YUM! He had a beer, and we split the \"Dip your own berries\". The chocolate was served in a martini glass and the strawberries were huge and fresh. Our bartender was awesome. She was extremely friendly and even let us change the channel to \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\"... instead of the infomercial that was on. Any bartender that lets me watch Adam Sandler  wins major points with me. 

Their prices, however, are pretty high. Our total bill with tip was about $35. But it's downtown Cleveland.. what do you expect?

I would love to come back for dinner one night. They have some interesting dishes such as pastas with white chocolate sauces and sandwiches with shaved chocolate in them. On the dining room tv's they play Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... cute little touch I think."}
{"text":"Went for night our with family on 1/29/11. We were excited for our first Chocolate Bar experience. However it was not much to write home about. After an hour wait for a table, we then waited 45 minutes for a server to come to our table. Finally the manager came by and told us someone would be with us shortly. The waiter showed up saying \"I'm not your server but I guess I can help you\". We went specifically for dessert and drinks. The dessert was so-so. Our drinks came after the dessert,  20 minutes after. Needless to say, We would not go back.  Too bad! We were looking forward to a great Willy Wonka like experience!!"}
{"text":"The drinks left me already looking forward to my next visit!! Yummy!!! The basil on my appetizer seemed 'not so fresh' but it was still tasty. The sweet potato fries are bangin'! Cuban- delicious. If you can leave room for dessert- do it! I had a triple chocolate something or other and it was delicious. 

My martinis were: Nutella and then a salted caramel pretzel.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had a great time there with my husband. Ambiance is great. Had the chocolate pretzel martini which was delicious! Only had the snickers dessert there and nothing else. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the most disappointing happy hour ever. NONE of their martinis are on special, and it's pretty much just beer and well liquor. Service was not so great. Martinis are OK, but you can get better at Billy's Martini Bar."}
{"text":"Fun place, great late night event for a date. We just had drinks and chocolate shoots, no food."}
{"text":"I went to the chocolate bar a little over a year ago and haven't been back. Actually, I am personally boycotting this place because I was treated so rudely by the hostess/owner. I went to meet a friend there after work for a happy hour. I got there first and ask to for a sit by the window. I was told no by the hostess/owner. Btw the place was half full. I ask her why and she said I have to sit at one of the 2 persons table. I told her that is ridiculous, the place was half full and I don't understand why she is making a big deal out of it. She told me I could leave. I asked to speak to a manager. She then told me she was the owner. I told her I couldn't believe that she would not meet a customer's request and that she had poor customer service. She shrugged, I left and went across the street to another bar. I haven't been back and try to steer my friends away from this place because of her."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch after winning some money at the casino (yay!) However my 20 min experience at this place gets a boo...I sat down at the bar and waited literally 10 minutes before somebody said \"be right with you.\" No menu while I wait or anything..I just stared at a bartenderless bar for another 6 or 7 minutes. Then, when an employee came back behind the bar again, somebody else that had been sitting at the bar needed his check or something. He was told \" it will be a minute.\" I was not acknowledged again. That's when I got up and left unnoticed...not a great first experience.."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from New York City and was told that the Chocolate Bar is a 'must' while I'm in town. My family and I walked in moments ago and was greeted by the most miserable and aggressive hostess I have ever encountered. How she ever secured a position that requires interaction with visitors I will never understand. Then she escorted us to a table, said a few more aggressive comments, and walked away leaving us with fingerprint covered glassware and a crumb covered table top. Perhaps we just visited while they were just have an off lunch. Either way, we will never come back."}
{"text":"Below average food, decent drinks. 

Do not come here with a party larger than 5, they will not spilt the check up.... 13 people and 1 check. What year is it????? I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service was awful tonight at 7:30, and it wasn't even really that busy. We were seated outside tonight where others were dining. Five minutes later, a hostess stopped by to give us water. 10 minutes later, we hadn't seen our server. I believe that our server walked by but she seemed very frazzled and didn't say that she would be with us shortly. I went inside to inform the hostess that we were leaving, and she told us that our server would be with us soon. We left. For fifteen minutes of our time, at least we got free water."}
{"text":"So disappointed! They shame you for wanting a table like it's putting them out. Came here with my girlfriends and the waiter was so rude he told us to go to the bar if we wanted drinks when we were already seated at a table. I'm pretty sure that if you are seated you get a waitress right??"}
{"text":"The drinks were deliciously strong (but not so strong we cringed).  We got the chocolate martinis, the banana chocolate martini, and the white chocolate martini.  The best was the original chocolate, but the others were good as well.

We got an appetizer of the original nachos and while I loooove black olives (I can eat them from the can) I was a little overwhelmed by the amount they put on the nachos.  My husband who is not an olive fan was very unimpressed.

We didn't eat our meal there but the other food looked good from what we could tell."}
{"text":"We stopped in for desert and a glass of wine.  Sat at the bar and had the turtle cheese cake & dark hot chocolate, both were delicious!  Bar tender was very friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and had a steak crostini. The bar was sticky, the crostinis were good, but a little greasey-- too much \"parsley oil. The martinis were well made, bartender was attentive and friendly enough."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Expensive. Uninspired food. A poor value if you care about things like that. But if you go to places like this, you probably don't. 

We went on a Sunday afternoon joint birthday and Mother's Day family outing. While spouse did call to make reservation, we were not told that Sunday from noon to 3 pm is a limited menu. As in, you can't have anything the people recommended to you except for liquor. I see where the restaurants values are. So three of us had an uninspired, bland, white-on-white turkey club. Really. My daughter makes a better panini at home. No vegetarian option on the limited menu. (Those people don't drink anyway). My \"classic\" martini ( you have to be specific in places like this. Otherwise you get a milk shake with vodka in it) was excellent even with the house vodka. Better be for $12. Our new legal drinker daughter had a strawberry mojito. Described as Strawberry lemonade. With a kick. And fresh tasty strawberries. 

Good location. Fun. But I'm lost to describe the menu."}
{"text":"The food was pretty bad.  I had a vegetable wrap which tasted like it had just come out of the fridge.

The atmosphere is even worse.  Lots of hard surfaces, blaring music and drunk people make it impossible to have a conversation with people who are right next to you.

The only reason I am giving this two stars is because the vanilla milkshake was good."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Chocolate Bar, I have only been there once & I will NEVER return. Worst service ever. Rude management & staff. In service industry myself & was appalled at the customer service."}
{"text":"Went to Chocolate Bar for dinner tonight with 3 friends...we had a blast! Dominic, one of the owners, is extremely hospitable...Sean, our server, was personable, knowledgeable, attentive. Great ambiance, great food, and to-die-for martinis!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a WONDERFUL way to experience chocolate in all its forms. I was there two years ago, two new years ago, in fact, and the ambiance, the service, the friendliness, the courtesy, efficiency, all were there! It is definitely a \"professionally run restaurant/organization, with a good staff-customer relationship, to boot....\" I would definitely return, in the blink of an eye!

What a lovely place to experience chocolate in all its glorY!

Go to the Chocolate Bar!!!!!! :)

{"text":"I went here with a friend on a Friday night for some dessert and a cocktail.  We were seated quickly and sat outside.  The tables and chairs were cheap (our table was uneven...try dealing with that while balancing two martinis and the chairs were faux metal that screeched each time someone moved it).  Our server was ok.  She was nice enough but definitely wasn't warm.  We ordered the Oreo Mud and the Belgian Chocolate Mousse Cake but I had previously ordered another dessert and while couples all around us who were seated at least 10 to 15 minutes after us got their desserts and drinks and FINISHED them, our waitress came back to tell me they sold out of my original order.  It was so painful to be surrounded by everyone eating their dessert and us just sitting there like...where is ours?!.  Our dessert finally showed up and it was pretty good.  Lots of sugar and lots of chocolate.  Nothing to write home about (because let's be honest, I could make those at home-and I'm not a baker).  It was satisfying in the fact that it was chocolate and we wanted some in dessert form.  

Going back to placing our dessert order, our waitress didn't really give us a chance to order any martinis so we had to order them when she stopped by to tell me they were 86 on my nutella dessert. I ordered the Dark Chocolate and Chili Martini and she warned me that it was spicy.  That's cool, I am ok with that.  My friend ordered the Raspberry Truffle Martini.  Uh, what the waitress didn't tell me and what it never said on the menu was that the drink I had was mostly made of cinnamon and not really chili.  It was inedible.  I couldn't drink it.  There was so much damn cinnamon on the rim and in the actual drink, I took about 3 sips and just couldn't do it.  I should have complained but we just wanted to roll out since we'd been there for quite sometime for desserts an a drink.

It feels like a chain (don't know if it is or not), their service is very mediocre (act like you want a good tip and actually care about your job!) and the fact that they are not honest about what makes up their drink selection is really annoying and disappointing.  I have always wanted to try it out and I did and I will not be wasting my time, money or my taste buds at the Chocolate Bar.  You can go some where else that's local, privately owned, for less with better quality everything besides at the Chocolate Bar.

Side Note:  What is up with the plastic cups for water?!  O.o"}
{"text":"Two chocolate martinis and a piece of raspberry truffle pie make up our visit here. All three were good and just the right thing to finish the night off after eating down the street at Lola Bistro. The pie here was actually better than any dessert I had at Lola. The french toast and bacon ice cream I had ealier was good but the truffle pie at Chocolate Bar was just more familiar and fit into the comfort food category so my tastebuds could relax and enjoy the rich and creamy deliciousness. The banana chocolate martini I had was good and so was the mint chocolate one my girl had but I'm not a huge dessert martini fan so I wouldn't return for the drinks and just come back for the pie. I feel though if I was a girl and had a group of girlfriends we would hang out here on a regular basis. It just has that kind of vibe. But not mattering the girl night out mojo I get from this place it won't deter me from coming back here for some tasty desserts next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you want pretty good chocolate flavored and other dessert flavored martinis this is the place to go! Their chocolate strawberry martini is really good, and I highly recommend it.

However, if you are looking for a dinner place I would say their food is average at best. I've had their food twice and the first time I tried their signature chocolate pasta. There wasn't really anything signature about it in my opinion. It was pretty bland and I didn't really taste the chocolate in it. 

The second time I had mac and cheese with caramelized onions in it. The mac and cheese was just so-so, nothing special even with the addition of the onions. 

Their desserts were also surprisingly not that good either. We got crepes and they were just average. Once again nothing special, except for their martini's."}
{"text":"If you like your dessert in a martini glass, then this is the place to go.  Most of the concoctions are super sweet and made with cheaper ingredients,  but if you're only looking for a dessert - like drink then head on in."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday weekend. From what I had heard, the Chocolate Bar is quite popular - especially during the weekend, but they don't take weekend reservations. Despite coming about an hour earlier than the rest of my party to get a table (so my friends/family wouldn't have to wait so long), the hostess told me that she didn't have a table for my large party of 11 people even though she had promised there would be a table available for my party within 45 mins to 1 hour. I was very frustrated at that point since I sat there the entire hour for a table.  I expressed my disappointment with a manager (or someone who looked more important than the hostess) and eventually they cleared up a table - 15 MORE minutes later. -__-

SERVICE - POOR

Our waitress was not friendly and didn't even crack a smile. She seemed rather annoyed and tired.  I know this restaurant is a very busy place, but every customer still deserves good service.


FOOD/DRINKS

Chocolate Bar Pasta
I ordered the chocolate pasta and it was surprisingly delicious.  It tasted sweet basically, but pleasantly so. The portions are small and it comes with a side of... corn?! Yes, corn. Tasty, but weird.  Would definitely recommend this dish!

White Chocolate Raspberry Martini
It tasted like cough medicine. I'm not a fan of martinis in general so you may have to try this for yourself.

Chocolate cup shooters w/ Milk Chocolate and White Chocolate Godiva liqueur 
YUMMY! The flavored liqueur you choose is served in edible chocolate cups. I recommend choosing Kahlua, Milk Chocolate Godiva, or White Chocolate Godiva.  It was a very fun way to start off our dinner. (Photo included)

Chocolate Fondue for 2
The chocolate dip kinda tasted like Hershey's chocolate syrup, but the presentation was lovely (Photo included).


ATMOSPHERE 

- Noisy/Fun/Lively 
- Very crowded/busy (at least on the weekends)
- Nice decor
- Clean restaurant
- Good for a night out with friends


Based on the other poor reviews, I'm a little hesitant to come back here, but their menu is just so interesting!  There are some other drinks and menu items I'd still like to try."}
{"text":"Sub-par desserts. Way too much whipped cream on everything."}
{"text":"Service was lackluster- our waiter never asked how anything was and generally seemed uninterested in being there. Ordered the chocolate fondue for two. Chocolate was cold, fruit for dipping was warm. Kind of weird. Martinis were ok, but not great. Tried to order a martini flight, but it is apparently bartenders choice (not mentioned on the menu), which defeats the purpose. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"We stopped in around 1 or 2 on Saturday. We sat at the bar because we just wanted a drink and dessert. They weren't very busy yet it took our server quite a while to greet us. It was kind of weird because the bartender wasn't taking care of us but a server who had another table was. We ordered our drinks from the server but we didn't get them for a good 10-15 minutes after ordering them. I had a smores martini and my husband had a salted Carmel martini. They were both good but not for $10 each. We also got strawberries and chocolate to dip ourselves. The strawberries weren't very big but were really good- not too sweet or sour. The chocolate to dip it in was delicious. It took our server longer than it should've to bring us our bill and to run our credit card to pay. I had read lots of bad reviews about this place but wanted to see for myself. Overall, I don't think I would be back. It was quite expensive for what it was and the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"I was really excited before going into this restaurant.  We visited the Body Exhibit first and came over for dinner.  Because chocolate was in the name, both my daughter and I decided to try their \"signature\" entrees.  My daughter ordered the chocolate baguette and I ordered the chocolate pasta.  After reading the description for the chocolate baguette, I tried to convince my daughter that she would not like it; a slice of chocolate, coarse sea salt on a baguette with dipping oil?  Did not sound appetizing to me and my daughter soon found out that is was nasty and way too salty.  They put a dab of chocolate and a whole lot of salt, I didn't even want to try it.  My chocolate pasta was very good. The white chocolate sauce was subtle and lightly sweet, but very good.  The portion sizes were not large, which was good for me, I don't eat a lot.  The prices were very affordable.  I did not try the martini's, my brain cannot calculate paying $10 for one drink.  It makes no sense and I don't care.  If someone else is paying then perhaps.  The dessert, we got the chocolate brownie explosion.  It was very good.  

Our server was either new or just plain dumb.  She had no clue on recommendations and I asked what type of pasta, she couldn't name it and when my daughter asked about the prosciutto for the alfredo, she said it was something on a piece of bread.  I had to explain to her(the waitress) what prosciutto was.  They ran out of a number of items, crepes, belgian desserts and etc.  Why not run to the store and make up a new batch?  I'm confused.  

The ambiance was nice and they dining room was decorated ok.  I believe that the restaurant has a good idea but very poorly executed.  The one thing I appreciated was the price,  very affordable.  They need better training of wait staff and some help kitchen with shopping on the weekends.  Dave's is down the street.  Would I go back again?  Probably."}
{"text":"Have stopped in before Indians games and a concert at the Q.  I am going to add the Chocolate Bar to my pre Playhouse Square agenda as well. The atmosphere is fun and you can watch all the action on east 4th from your table.
Had drinks and appetizers which is perfect for a group of ladies that wanted to enjoy conversation, food and a good drink before an event.  
Flatbreads were perfect to split between two women as a light snack with a drink or two before the show.  I am not a big martini drinker so I don't know if I can offer the best rating on them but I thought they were very good. Staff gracious and accommodating.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I know so many people who are disappointed by this place they must be surviving on tourism alone. I personally only go when dragged for birthdays and bachelorettes. 
          The food combinations are interesting but they usually don't pull it off. White chocolate alfredo was flavorless, pecan chicken was dry and flavorless, strawberry basalmic flatbread pizza was dry (and stingy! Maybe 3 strawberries on the whole thing), I did love the aztec hot chocolate ice cream.
          Even as mediocre and overpriced as this place is I would still go for something new once in a while if it wasn't for their service. HORRIBLE! I learn new policies every time I go and none of them are good for business! Only desserts after 9pm. They DO NOT split checks and they have a few times told me they don't accept credit cards which i'm pretty sure is not the case. The waitresses are crabby- you would think women surrounded by chocolate all day would behave better!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I gave a 2 star rating is because their nachos and location are both good. Yesterday was the third time that we were seated by the same hostess (rude, shorter hair, middle-aged women) and every time she has given us one of the worst tables in house even thouggh there were 15 other tables open..... Strangest thing ever! If your restaurant isnt busy, wouldn't you want to take care of the people who are patronizing your business??  Since she put us up against the wall in the little, freezing room upfront that had 5 foot curtains from mid window to the floor (therefore, makes you feel closed in) and couldnt see anything in the middle of the day,  we moved to the bar. Well, that was a mistake! The bartender made us possibly two of the worst martinis that we have ever had plus he was also on the rude side and gave poor service. I ordered the salted carmel martini, which came out like slight runny pudding. It was so thick and sweet that i only drank a third of it...and never once did he ask if it was ok or if I needed/wanted something else. I had to ask for water, which was never refilled after chugging it to try and get the chocolate coating out of my throat. We also had to ask for silverware and napkins!  My husband ordered a slightly dirty vodka martini, which honestly tasted as though he made it extra dirty. Isnt their specialty supposed to be martinis?? Even though we stay at the Hyatt Regency often and go downtown for dinner often, we will NEVER go back to this restaurant...way too many other options in the area! Third time was definitely not a charm."}
{"text":"We were excited to come to this place and didn't order the one thing that we came here for which was the chocolate shot cup, lol. We sat outside and were served water in plastic cups which was fine but they had like crumbs in it. My fiancé noticed for and asked for a new cup of water and then I noticed that were some in mine. They replaced that pretty quickly. We ordered philly cheesesteak flatbread, nachos, and sweet potato fries. 

The philly cheesesteak was kind of bland but otherwise okay. The nachos were good but kind of dry. The sweet potato fries were awesome. We went through these so quickly and the dipping sauces they had with it were surprisingly complimentary. Would come back for the fries and cocktail probably, saw that a whole bunch of people were ordering drinks. We didn't that day. 

Would give it another go. Plus the location is great for people watching."}
{"text":"Considering that it was after midnight, the food was pretty good. I had a smokey grilled cheese sandwich that was comprised of cheddar, gouda, bacon and tomato. The side of fresh kettle chips...delicious. I also had a creme brulee martini. The creme brulee part was authentic flavor. The liquor, though, tasted cheap. It reminded me of rubbing alcohol. Would I go again? Maybe. I wouldn't go for a martini though."}
{"text":"Visiting from Toronto for the U2 concert. We couldn't find a table at most any of the spots on East 4th, so settled on this spot where they still had room at the bar. Wife and I had a great time. Food was good, great selection of drinks and a lovely chocolate dessert. Would have been 4 stars but the server messed up a couple of items on the order and then there were some mistakes on the bill."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Our first visit was for dinner on 1/4/15 before we headed to a movie. We were seated right away. The menu looks pretty delicious from chocolate martini, hot chocolate, food, and desserts! We both opted for sandwiches given we wanted to try desserts. Our sandwiches and \"desserts\" were delicious!

We stopped in again Saturday night for drinks and desserts! We were seated right away at a table by the door. It was cold due to the door opening frequently (and the cold temps outside), but we were glad to have a space heater right next to us. Our server was very friendly and pleasant. Our drinks and desserts arrived pretty quickly despite the place being packed. Again, everything was delicious! We both will return!"}
{"text":"Do not fall for this place.  The dessert feels mass produced and the drinks were not \"Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in a glass.\"  It wasn't that any of it was bad it just wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"This place has the best menu.  It always takes me awhile for me to decide what to eat. Something for everyone.  Flatbreads are tough to beat.  The chicken wing soup is homemade and incredible.  They could just serve martinis and be amazing.  About 25 to choose from and ive tasted about 11 and all incredible.  Taste like heaven.  Location is perfect.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Menu is HUGE for martinis and dessert!  Food looked great but we only got dessert. We both got ice cream sundaes and they were delicious. $10 each tho. But for the size I would say that's pretty good. Service was friendly a little slow due to how busy they were Friday night at 7pm."}
{"text":"I went their with my daughters ages 10 and 7 and with another mom and daughter. Service was very very slow. My younger daughter ordered Mac and cheese. How can you screw up Mac and cheese?  It was absolutely flavorless and had an odd texture. When I said this to the manager/owner she was so rude and just said\"everyone makes it different\" and walked away. Terrible attitude and obviously doesn't care about customer service. She kept it on the bill as it sat uneaten on the table. I will never go back and will never reccomend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday and I can't wait to go back again! We had the chocolate sandwich for an appetizer and it was unbelievably good.  Everyone liked their lunch but dessert was great!   We had strawberries which we dipped in a martini glass filled with chocolate!  

The service was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"We stopped by The Chocolate Bar for Happy Hour (which is from 3pm-7pm) on our way to an Indians game and the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Their HH specials are decent and the tomato & mozzarella salad was delicious.  I would also recommend the white chocolate raspberry martini as well as a crepe for dessert (it's served with a side of ice cream).  It's definitely a good place to go for drinks/dessert and the prices are about on par with others in the area."}
{"text":"So... Of course it's not good, but they are open late which is why I was there. Really nothing wrong with any of it other the the general level of cheesiness- price was right and the service was fine.  Don't go out of your way but if your starving and it 11 pm your in luck"}
{"text":"Made reservations for dinner and when we arrived, Bianca, the hostess, said they didnt have any record of our reservations.  She told me that she would put me at the end of the list and it would be over an hour wait. We walked out and will not be back there."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday for the 2nd year in a row the other night. 
Last year all we had was martinis and dessert- a crepe. Delicious!

This year we had martinis, dinner, and dessert. I had a nutella martini- so good, you occlude taste the hazelnut. She had the chocolate chocolate mint. It was so strong she couldn't really enjoy it. Could be a bonus for some, but not for the casual drinker. 

We're' both vegetarians so the menu wasn't too awful, but there weren't too many vegetarian options either. I had the alfredo with portabella mushrooms on the top. SOOO good, so creamy, so garlicy... Probably the best alfredo i've ever had. Definitely recommend.

She had the chocolate bar pasta. It. Was. Awful. Please please please don't order the chocolate bar pasta. It tastes like nothing. It literally tastes like pasta with whipped cream on it.  It's paired with a random pile of flavorless corn. She didn't want to be a bother and didn't tell them, but i'm telling you it was the worst meal ever. If you're the kitchen manager or owner and you're reading this, please change that pasta dish, it's awful.

We had the bananas foster crepe for dessert this time and it was good, but we were too full to finish it. We took it home. 

Our server was so sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Friday night, 1 bartender, 2 girls standing in the coffee area texting. Management is nowhere to be found. Very underwhelming."}
{"text":"I usually bring out of town visitors to impress them with chocolate martinis and spiked hot chocolated (my persona favorites are the Coconut Macaroon and the Rasberry Vodka). The problem was that, this time, my visitors were thrilled by the \"chocolate\" name and wanted to try Chocolate Milkshake and A Chocolate Molten cake. Terrible decision....

Chocolate Milkshake had 0 chocolate flavor which was a disappointment for a \"chocolate bar\". If you want a good chocolate Milkshake please try Flip Side (on west 10th St) or B- Spot (I have only tried Crocker Park but they have a location at the casino downtown too)

The chocolate molten was really dry with little to no flavor as well. 

To top the experience, the waitress made a bid deal to sit us at a table because we had no reservation on a Sunday afternoon with more than half of the restaurant empty. Before sitting us he wanted to know if we were going to \"really had food\" and when we said just drinks and dessert he hesitated, then proceeded to sit us. Yes, it was as awkward as it sound.

So sad that a nice Cleveland landmark has untrained staff and do not meet the \"chocolate name\" expectations."}
{"text":"Went to The Chocolate Bar last night with a friend for a night cap.  As we were staying at the Hyatt Regency, adjacent to the Chocolate Bar, we came in the back door from The Arcade.  A sign there said to go to the front of the place to be seated, so we did.  There we stood by three employees who, after about a half a minute silently looking at us, asked if they could help us.  We asked to be seated.  Seemingly taken aback, they snapped into action, determined where to take us, and seated us at a table for two near the front of the restaurant, and handed us two food menus and a drink menu.  We picked up the laminated menus and noticed they were completely smeared with grease.  We lost our appetites and left, telling the staff their menus were disgusting.  They said nothing and gave us dirty looks as we left.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I always love going here when I am on East 4th, whether it's for dinner or just a drink. You can't go wrong with their martinis, and the food is pretty good too. Last time I went, I got the Pesto Chicken flatbread, which was delicious and I would definitely get again, and two Chocolare salted carmel martinis (my favorite on my menu)."}
{"text":"The Bad
My dad and I shared the Southern Sirloin with Jack Daniels.  Marinated in it and also served with the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce on top. We ordered it medium rare. When itcame out, it was easily medium well, very close to well done. After taking a bite each (trying it first because neither of us like to send stuff back. If we can tough it out and it's not that bad we will just eat it but we literally would have had to TOUGH it out because it took me about five minutes to chew that one piece of steak) We called our server Erin P over and she took her time examining our steak with a look on her face like \"are you kidding me?\". I was a waitress for years. I would NEVER have treated a customer like that. It was clearly well over done, and she took her time looking through both our pieces of steak (we had cut it in half to split it). She then said \"well, I'll have to bring the manager out here to see it\" again. Never, especially when it's SO obvious. Have I as a customer been treated like that or have I as a waitress treated a customer like that. She then came back and said \"okay, well. The manager said we can remake it. But it will take like, at least ten minutes\" we said okay that's fine and it definitely took that whole time. When you mess up a customers order, you should put that to the front of the line and get that out ASAP no questions asked. I was appalled at our treatment by Erin, Throughout the entire meal. 

The Good
We ordered the Tomato Mozz salad to start (Mozz+tomato+basil+balsamic). It was pretty dang good. 
We also shared the Berry Good Salad, Blueberries, strawberries, pecans, romain, and poppyseed dressing. It was also dang good."}
{"text":"I really would give this place 2 stars instead of three, but the redeeming quality was that their chocolate pasta was subtly delicious. A bare hint of white chocolate mixed with their white sauce pasta. Personally, I don't like white sauce or even much pasta, but this dish is pretty unique and tastes great. 

Service was horrible, we waited a very long time to order, and an even longer time to receive the check. 

I couldn't try their chocolate drinks due to the fact that it all contained vodka, but my coworker said she liked it very much. 

For a place called 'Chocolate Bar', I would assume that there would be more chocolate entree dishes instead of just two (chocolate pasta and chocolate baguette). But, what is the assumption rule? Don't assume!"}
{"text":"First,  service is 5 stars.  The bartender Chuhim was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The energy is pleasing and the place is clean.  I can't wait to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Food is great but wow the service was awful. Made reservations and finished our meal then we were asked to leave by a manger because there was another incoming party. That was after an automatic 18% gratuity was taken. Won't go back due to the unprofessionalism displayed. Of all the restaurants I've visited, that was truly a first."}
{"text":"Awesome.....What a great place and a novel idea.......Martinis with a chocolate straw,Shots with a belgian chocolate shot glass......We had peanut butter cup,chocolate,Creme Brulee,and Banana creme pie Martinis.......
The food menu was interesting & very good too.....Its attached to the hyatt regency,so it was convenient too"}
{"text":"Excellent food, waiter was so nice and attentive, great relaxing atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but we had a horrible five minutes here this past Saturday night. 

Yes, I said five minutes. I've heard enough horror stories about this place before, so I didn't really expect to have the best time, but we still wanted one last drink after a holiday office party. Fellow Yelper, Shayna R. and I walked in and were greeted by a really nice hostess and we chose to sit at the bar. When we sat down, the bartender didn't make any eye contact, slung the drink menus at us and marched away. Granted, it was kind of late and she probably wanted to go home, but that didn't change the fact that we were about to drop $15 on simple drinks and evidently poor service. 

Needless to say, after reading through the not-so-thrilling drink menu and being completely ignored by the snot behind the bar, we walked out. AND, I personally hated the curtain before the door. It hides who's coming and going and makes it impossible to see the step down toward the door as you're scrambling to get away from the cranky staff."}
{"text":"I am blown away by how poorly I was treated. I went in for my birthday last night just to grab a drink. We were ignored by everyone except the hostess who clearly didn't care about us anyway. We sat and waited for service, for a while and decided to leave. Nowhere else was open so we went back just to get a dessert to go. We stood at the counter and awkwardly waited for someone to speak to us for an unreasonable amount of time... Again. The host finally asked us if we need anything. I explained that we left because we were being ignored. Her only response was sorry. Didn't get a manager, nothing. I work service industry and when a customer is upset you grab a manager no matter what. She made absolutely ZERO effort to try and fix the situation. The Busser also seemed to be aware because he stared us down and pointed us out to his friends at the bar for some reason. I'm appalled that a place with such prime realty in Cleveland gets by treating their guests like this."}
{"text":"Yesterday I came to the Chocolate Bar for a birthday lunch. My mom and I were very excited to try this for the first time and decided to skip breakfast and then get two desserts each for lunch.

We went about 12:00 and it wasn't very busy. We got seated right away and the staff was very friendly. They give you a water to have on the table, which is very nice and makes it easier for both us and the waiter. The staff was all very friendly.

We first ordered the peanut butter ice cream dessert and one of the chocolate cakes. The ice cream was absolutely amazing. The size was fantastic for the price. The ice cream was creamy and the toppings were decadent. My mom enjoyed her cake and it was a good size.

Next I got the mouse cake. It was HUGE, creamy, and rich. Possibly one of the best cakes I've had. The presentation on all of the cakes was very thought out and pretty. 

I would come here again and also try the actual food."}
{"text":"Great place to take your girlfriend for dessert and chocolatey martinis. The ambiance is very nice and the service is good. It's in a convenient area for a good night out."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out, we love to hang out and have a few drinks, but as soon as we walked in the waiter told us last call would be at 10:30 then she told the couple behind us 10:15 (which we chose this place because it said open until midnight). I tried the martini flight which was good enjoyed the drinks but didn't order anymore because felt rushed. We did order food which came out in about 10 minutes from us sitting down, that was bland and not very good quality food at all and I ordered a steak so was hoping for a good experience. Unfortunately won't be back unless I'm wanting just a sweet martini."}
{"text":"I'm not a chocolate lover, but the carrot cake here was incredible. Service was great, and the restaurant was clean"}
{"text":"I am big on customer service, I want the whole experience to be good, not just the food. I honestly cannot tell you what the food is like here, as my husband and I ended up walking out. 

We we're greeted and sat immidiately, which was nice. Our waitress came over right away and asked what we wanted to drink, we were both happy with the water that was already at our table in a carafe. She said she'd be right back to take our order. It was 1:49 and we were wanting to get items that stopped being available after 2, so we were hoping she'd come back soon for our order... At 2:05 she had still not come to take our orders. We couldn't even waive her down as she wouldn't even turn her head in our direction. We were seated away from everyone else and felt like we had been forgotten. Finally, after almost 20 minutes of waiting, we just decided to leave. 

Even the busiest of places I've been to the server would check in, or stop by to say \" I didn't forget about you, be right back\" but not from this place. The sad thing is they weren't even that busy. I'd say pass and spend your time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The shakes are five-star. I had the strawberry and it was one of the best I've ever had. The spinach salad however was a disaster. Great service though."}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain how delicious their martini's are! I always get the chocolate covered strawberry one and it is beyond extraordinary. I also have tried the creme brulee and swedish fish!! Super good and the food is wonderful too. I love to sit outside and take in all that downtown Cleveland has to offer."}
{"text":"Bachelorette party central could also be a name for this place. The Saturday night in June I came with my friend, the bride-to-be, we were one of five bachelorette parties there that night. It was early in the evening, so everyone was well behaved. Our group was only obviously a bachelorette party because of the sheer number of us. I am confused by this place because it seems to be set-up more as a restaurant than a bar, unlike what the name suggests. Yes, I get that the name is a pun. But, you can't call yourself a bar and then seem annoyed that people are there to stand around and drink. I'm also confused by the food thing because I've never heard anyone say the draw of the chocolate bar is the food...everyone wants to try the chocolate martinis. I saw the menu. I don't remember anything from it. I don't blame the staff for seeming annoyed by the crowded bar...the bar is in the center of the space and must walk through the area to get to tables near the front. We felt in the way the entire evening servers need to navigate through the crowd. I have no problem with busy bars; the problem is that we really were in the way, and that really is my only complaint. 

The staff was working very hard to keep everyone served, but the disorganization caused by the cluster at the bar was off putting to other groups as well. Normally, I prefer busy bars, but since martinis need to be sipped, especially sweet ones, I'm only going back on a quiet evening. 

I ordered a peanut butter cup. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Chocolate pretzel martini was delicious!!! Also got the pecan chicken and it was pretty good. Highly recommend any chocolate martini."}
{"text":"We went in on a friday night about 7:30pm. The bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to even notice us. We finally managed to flag one down only to be given a sticky menu- where absolutely none of the martinis are described. So if you have any allergies beware. Anyway, we ordered martinis and I was given a martini with ice cubes still floating in it! My friends martini had no taste and no alcohol in it. Staff was rude and unattentive and the drinks sucked. Skip this place."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Cleveland and i thought we would check this place out. There was a 1 hour wait but The service was INCREDIBLE!! I can not say enough good things about our waiter Shawn/Sean. He was very charismatic and tried very hard to make us enjoy our experience. The Cajun Pasta was amazing! Everything just had so much flavor and the dessert was to die for! I can tell everything was so well made and everything was rolling out so quickly! We had a three course meal in about an hour which was amazing! I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the martinis.  Or as I like to call them, the liquid devil.  The bartenders are definitely candid about which ones they think are the best-tasting, and so far I have found their recommendations to be spot-on.  Kudos to the Espresso, Swedish Fish, and Black Forest martinis.  They are so yummy.  We've had the Georgia Peach, White Chocolate, Raspberry Truffle, Chocolate Banana Cream Pie, and I tasted the Peanut Butter.  These are all solid choices as well.  Steer clear of the Orange Chocolate (too artificial orange tasting) and the Key Lime (which was hands down THE worst Key Lime martini I've ever had).  Good bar scene.  Oh, and don't forget the Chocolate shooters.  They are dee-lish.  And watch your step--nothing like getting a serious buzz and having to walk down approximately 15 steps to the bathroom.  Use the hand railing, people!"}
{"text":"In Cleveland with family for show. ..service was cool...small brunch menu. I had the smoked salmon...ok..nothing to right home about. Brother had the French toast...had a bite of his...Formidable!

Cool..tourist spot...."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hyatt so we figured we had to stop in. We figured we should start with food, a Tuscan sandwich and southwest chicken salad, both pretty bad. We had been drinking at this point too so that emphasizes how bad the food was. Bummer. We both tried a martini (our waitress steered us away from the martini flight saying you get barely an entire martini for more money). The chocolate mint and the pineapple were both yummy. Tried the coconut mint mojito which was also tasty. Had the brownie dessert and I'd give it an eh...  Not great. Also share it with someone, it's huge. I wouldn't say I was overall impressed with the place and wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"The dessert menu was massive and the four that our table tried were delicious. Service was good. We'd go back for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I should say that the first and only time I've been here was just for a drink post-dinner, so I can't say anything about their food. This is really solely a review of their hot chocolate.

My visiting friend and I had gotten dinner and margaritas at Zocalo, and were heading home on a particularly windy and cold night. I had been in Cleveland for 9 months and my boss kept asking if I had gone to Chocolate Bar - so I seized the opportunity and we went inside. I didn't really know what to expect - I hadn't realized it'd be so restaurant oriented, I guess I had incorrectly pictured more of a bakery-and-bar type thing.

Anyway, we got seats pretty quickly and poured over their menu. Holy hot chocolate. In every form. Normal? Dark? Aztec? English toffee? Caramel? Sea salt? Check. Not only that, but if you turn a page you can then get a spiked hot chocolate - which we both did. 

My spiked Aztec Hot Chocolate was delicious and rich, and served at the perfect temperature - I didn't have to wait for it to cool down, but it was delightfully warm. My friend got the spiked English toffee hot chocolate, and my sip of it was equally delicious. Both came with a chocolate stirrer that melted into my drink in about 10 seconds, only for me to rediscover the melted chocolate at the bottom of my glass.

That being said - both drinks were so good that I sort of wished I had gotten it sans alcohol.  Were they overpriced? Probably, but considering that the closest I normally get to hot chocolate is some Swiss Mix mixed into my morning coffee at work (if you haven't tried this, you should), it was work the price. 

I will say that I saw a few couples here, and it made me cringe a little because the place is just a little too sweet. Maybe I'm just coldhearted though... but seriously! Chocolate bar? Uggg. Too Valentine's-y for me, and it was early January.

The bathrooms were also sort of tricky to find - you have to go out the back door of the restaurant, into the Arcade, and go down a set of stairs. Still, not that bad, and they were pretty clean.

Anyway, I would go back here on another cold night - but only to have a hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Martinis are 5 stars! We tried the s'mores, Nutella, and peanut butter cup (s'mores was the favorite). Absolutely fantastic! 

Before going, I read many reviews saying the food was just ok. I tried to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt but it was probably the worst food I've gotten at a sit down restaurant. I got the Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken. I kind of thought this would be a \"safe\" choice after reading other reviews. It had no flavor and the chicken was very dry. Had I not been with a large group celebrating a birthday, I probably would have said something to management. Paying $14 for what I received made my wallet very sad. My friends got the spinach dip appetizer and that was tasty! 

Overall, if you just want some amazing, unique martinis with maybe a couple apps, chocolate bar is a great choice. If you're actually hungry, go somewhere else for dinner and maybe do desert here. You can definitely get a better meal for a comparable price."}
{"text":"I visted the Chocolate Bar a couple times with coworkers while on a business trip to Cleveland.  The alcoholic shakes we tried were excellent - the Banana Ram Ya and Dirty Girl Scout were VERY tasty!  We had a couple appetizers that were also good, although not on the same leval as the shakes.   The atmosphere was great and I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The food was ok, I had the smoked grilled cheese with bacon and it's definitely something that I could make on my own. It wasn't anything super special but the dessert was amazing. I had the hot fudge brownie crepe and it definitely made up for my meal."}
{"text":"So last night, four of my friends and myself showed up at about 10pm for a few appetizers and martinis before a night out in Cleveland. which of course we were prepared for a wait, the host then told us that it would be an hour and a half wait. so obviously we were a little surprised at such a long wait so late in the night, then she proceeded to tell us that \"it's a Saturday night in Cleveland so\".. her condescending attitude wasn't necessary. then we asked if we could stand at the bar and wait and she informed us that they can't have people standing around who aren't waiting on tables... so we never got to experience the food or drinks but we had an awful experience with the host so I'm glad we didn't end up staying there where someone can have such a terrible attitude."}
{"text":"I made a mistake and started this review while we were still at the table. Now that I have the chance to review, I felt a couple extra points needed to be added. The wait at the door wasn't long. We got to a table in about 5 minutes. However after being seated, it took the waitress 15 minutes to take our drink orders. 20 minutes later we still had no drinks, and had not placed a food order. At this point we had been at a table for 35 minutes with nothing to show for it. In that time, I watched our waitress stop waiting on tables, to collect a tip from a table that left, and then she disappeared for 10 minutes. We decided to cancel our drink orders and leave at this point. She told us the drinks were ready, and she was just getting ready to bring them to the table. So we said we would take those, but then we needed the bill. At this point, we watched her go up to the bar, and place the drink order. The bad thing about this, is that the drink order was one bottled beer.

As we were leaving, she told us next time to think about coming on a night that isn't as busy and plan for a longer meal. Never got to taste their food which looked like it could be good. But no food is worth the poor poor service ilke this. There are too many good places in Cleveland to waste our time here again!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The \"manager\" stood at the hostess station and flirted with every girl who came in plus the young hostess themselves. He had little to no interest in running the place. Our buffalo chicken nachos were terrible mostly chips, chicken cold and frankly funky tasting. My steak BLT came out on burnt bread and was bland. My GF's mac and cheese with steak was a joke. It was super greasy plus there was only two small steak strips thrown in the middle of it, definitely not worth the extra 2 or 3 dollars it was. Her drink took about 15 minutes to get to the table but my shake took about 5 minutes and it was pretty decent. When all said and done, no one apologized or cared to for that matter. I recommend you only stop in for a drink and dessert and sit at the bar so you get some kind of service but overall Extremely overrated. Go to one of the other restaurants on east 4th"}
{"text":"Got to the Chocolate Bar today at 9pm and told the hostess that we I had a party of 8 and she seemed very unhappy about it and confused. Note that the bar was practically empty. She eventually sat and and the bartender came by immediately and asked what we wanted to drink. We hadn't even looked at the menu yet. Then the hostess comes by again and announces that the place closes at 10pm. Now I see, they were in a hurry to get us out of there. We got our drinks and were not asked if we wanted a second round. I over heard the manager yelling at one of her workers. She eventually came over to us and told us to get out because they needed to mop the floor. We told her we would love to leave but we haven't been given a check yet. The workers in this place were extremely rude and I will not be returning to a place where it seems like they don't even want my business. I have never been to a place where I felt so uncomfortable because it seemed like they didn't want us there. I'm done with the Chocolate Bar and the rude workers there."}
{"text":"I've been to The Chocolate Bar twice for a nightcap after other events and it was a perfect place to get a classy beverage and enjoy our company.

The desserts, as expected, were very good. Rich and indulgent. The first visit my friend ordered a divine black forest cake martini. It lived up to it's name and price ($10ish if i recall correctly). We appreciated the wine list and the beer list had enough to offer ( craft beers and domestics).

During my second visit, we ordered a trio of chocolate shooters  which are little milk chocolate cups with your choice of liquor. I would suggest the Chamord. They were a nice treat. Sweet enough to sweeten my palette since I didn't want a full dessert. Still full from dinner I didn't order dessert, and stuck with Apothic Red wine. My companions ordered the peanut butter chocolate cake (which reminded more of snickers than peanut butter)and the chocolate chocolate cake. They were kind enough to share a bite. Again, both were divine and very large. Average price of desserts is $7 - $9. Speciality desserts are also available. I've been spying the $12 s'mores. You get to make your own s'mores at the table. Oh my goodness.

The place was open, decorated upscale, and dimly lit. It had good ambience. It was bustling with activity but quiet enough for conversation. Both visits we were seated promptly. The service was efficient for 1am on crowded nights.

Great place for a date, a girls' night out, a birthday, or for ending your night. I must get those s'mores!"}
{"text":"Drinks are excellent, but food is mediocre. I've had the Creme Brûlée, Chocolate Covered Pretzel, Peanut Butter Cup, and Raspberry Truffle martinis. All were excellent. I held my sisters bachelorette party dinner here and it was a hit! They gave us a private room in the back and sat all 11 of us very comfortably. All the girls loved their drinks and our service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Another really good meal! French Onion soup was wonderful as were the crab cakes. My daughter got a Cesar Salad that was very good. Our server was a doll! Even on a crazy busy night (first game of the World Series and Cavs opener) service was great."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant but there has never been a time I haven't had a problem with service. Unfortunately the staff here really doesn't seem to believe in customer service. Just a heads up to anyone trying the place out. It's great food and drinks but you'll be treated like garbage."}
{"text":"Good meal, excellent service, tasty chocolate! I enjoyed the grilled chicken and shrimp over fettuccine.i had to pass on the bread because it was stale.i had a slice of chocolate mouse which I took to go. This could b y the slice was small and there was no added features such as whip cream."}
{"text":"Oh, Chocolate Bar... Your delicious martinis are no longer enough to sustain more than one star. My husband and I went tonight to kick off Cleveland Restaurant Week. When my husband asked the server, Dmitry, what he recommended. He gave us the least passionate answer ever and didn't even begin to sell us on any of the dishes. I had the mac and cheese and it was absolutely tasteless. Now I sit here waiting for him to take this awful dish away and I've been waiting for a while... Long enough to write this review. We won't be returning again. Update! So he came to the table and didn't bother questioning why I had 2/3 of my entree left. Oy vey!"}
{"text":"Took my friend for his 21st birthday and it was possibly the worst experience ever. 

The waiter was rude, slow, and didn't bring out our food which was at the window for 15 minutes. 

I asked the waiter for a birthday shot and he said that the restaurant didn't have any left...?? This was clearly a management problem. Manager did not even apologize for the poor service. 

Atmosphere: 7/10 
Food: 6/10 Food was very mediocre. 
Service: 2/10

{"text":"If you like chocolate (and I do) give this place a try. It was fine for dinner - we had the cajun shrimp and BBQ flatbread -  and the drinks were great, chocolate martini and a kicked up coffee. For dessert we tried the Belgian Chocolate Mousse Cake which was excellent. The service was a little slow - our waiter was kind of confused and spent some time talking up a couple of young ladies. But we weren't in a hurry so......."}
{"text":"The drinks and happy hour was great. The pay that distracted us the most was the employees lingering at the bar while my date and i were trying to have a conversation. One employee was even complaining about a guest. It was very unprofessional. It truly distracted us from our night."}
{"text":"The reviews are correct. The martinis are great the food is so so. We had the chocolate pretzel and salted caramel. Both were excellent.

For dinner we had the cocoa covered spicy pork tenderloin cuts and it was good. The potatoes and the mango salsa were boring. 

Go for drinks and if you've got nothing better to do, stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I haven't tried the food here yet.  I'll be coming back during Downtown Restaurant Week to sample the menu.  Because so many other reviewers said the food was mediocre, I decided to stick with the drinks.

I was with a group, so we all tried everything.  We began with the Chocolate Bar Shooters which are a Belgian chocolate cup filled with the liquor of choice.  The menu claims the shot is a half ounce.  I think it's even less.  I had mine with Godiva liquor, and while good, not worth the price tag.  For real drinks, we had the following at our table: Swedish Fish martini, Georgia Peach martini, Cocoa Puff Alp'accino, and a Toasted Almond Alp'accino.  The Swedish Fish martini was spot on...seriously a Swedish Fish in liquid form.  The Georgia Peach was good, too.  The Toasted Almond Alp'accino, which  was true to its name, was definitely better than the Cocoa Puff which was not at all chocolately.  Beware that the Alp'accinos are EXTREMELY filling even though we split them.  Definitely not something you want to drink before your dinner arrives, but may be good as a dessert replacement.

While the drinks are delicious, they do come with a steep price tag.  Good for a night you're willing to splurge, but likely not a weekly visit.

I am looking forward to returning again to give the food menu a try."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I did. I wanted to love it. The idea of a restaurant serving creative desserts, chocolate martinis and some entrees with chocolate in them was incredibly appealing. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to par.

Don't get me wrong, there are still some good things here. The martinis are excellent. They're pricey, but well worth it for the amount of alcohol they contain. I've had the swedish fish and the creme brulee, and both were great.

The food is so-so. Some things are good, and others need definite improvements.

Apps- I've had the baked brie, chocolate bar foccacia, and the spinach and artichoke dip. The baked brie was the best by far. The fruit chutney served with the brie and toast definitely made the dish. The chocolate bar foccacia was also good, but I was imagining it to be something with chocolate. It was a piece of foccacia stuffed with red peppers, olives and mozzarella. Kind of greasy actually. It was good, but nothing special. Same with the spinach and artichoke dip.

Entrees-I've only ever had one entree here, and it was the chocolate bar pasta. I was so excited to see how they balanced sweet and savory in the dish, and my mouth was watering. Unfortunately, I got none of it. It tasted like a bland cream sauce that was barely sweetened. I had to add a ton of salt to it for it to have any flavor. I've always wanted to try their mac and cheese bar, but the quality of the entrees has me thinking I'll just stick to their apps and drinks.

Desserts-This is where they should shine. They have unique combinations, and you will definitely be indecisive in picking just one. I've had the peanut butter mud, belgian chocolate mousse cake, heath bar torte, and turtle cheesecake. All are good, but be prepared to stop eating after a 1/4 or 1/3. The desserts are pretty heavy and sweet, and you're going to want to pace yourself. 

If you come here, I suggest coming for drinks/apps, or just desserts. Doing all these will definitely be an overload. Skip the entrees entirely."}
{"text":"Stayed in the accompanying hotel and stopped here for breakfast before the game. Excellent Breakfast Burrito! My son and I both had it. It was huge and a pretty fair price. Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I came here during a visit to Cleveland with friends and thought it would be something different to try. We were here during the exact time of the Solar Eclipse and the staff was nice enough to share their glasses so we could also take a look! I think they were a bit distracted but that's ok. I wasn't feeling well so I didn't drink, I got the sweet potato fries with chocolate as a dipping sauce, very good!"}
{"text":"I came here just for dessert on a late Saturday night.

My boyfriend and I came here around 10:30 just after the Cavs game ended. We ended up waiting about 30min until a table opened up for us. 

Our server was friendly and pleasant. We ordered a triple something cake (forgot ecabrlu what it was called), a chocolate creme brulee, mint hot chocolate and a decaf coffee. 

I wish I got the regular creme brulee because the chocolate one had way too much cake and not enough custard. The little vanilla custard that was there was super creamy and deliscious. Probably my favourite part of our dessert.

The mint hot chocolate was also super tasty. It had the perfect balance of mint and chocolate. It was not bitter but it also wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. Everything about the drink was balanced. 

The desserts were good and there is a great selection. It isssss a chocolate bar so everything is pretty sweet. It also seemed like a lot of their desserts overlapped... 

Anyway, I saw some tables nearby with tasty looking entrees so maybe I'll have to come back for some real food."}
{"text":"This was the worst dinner experience I have EVER had.

To be honest, I went to school for baking and pastry. I have also spent a few years as a restaurant manager. Pretty much, I know the tricks of the trade and I know how I should be treated.

When 3 waiters just walk past my boyfriend and I when we walk in and it's dead, I was nervous. He REALLY wanted to try a place with chocolate in the name, so we waited about 5 minutes to be seated

Our waitress finally comes and she's pleasant, but disinterested. We both ordered the Maple Pecan Chicken. It sounded so yummy!

It took over 20 minutes to get our food. It takes 10 minutes to make sweet potato fries from scratch. It only takes 7 minutes to cook a chicken breast. 20 minutes in a dead restaurant. is too long.

We dig in and it tastes great. My boyfriend woofs his down and he's saying something isn't right. I get to the middle of the my breast and it's cold. Not luke warm, not cool, I'm talking from the fridge cold. It's completely cooked though, so it means one thing- they cooked the breast, chilled it and reheated it. There's no need for it in when it's that slow and a thermometer would have fixed it.

When we finally get our waitress's attention, she offers to have it remade (it takes another 20 minutes). While waiting another waitress offers to get us another entree, but I declined. Then, a server comes over acting like he's a manager. He says that I will get a free dessert, but I \"will pay\" for my dinner. This is ungodly rude. The manager never came out. 

The dessert we had were mediocre. A jobless culinary school graduate could have come up with better. The strawberry garnish was pre-cut and going bad. My boyfriend's dessert was wrong. He asked for a different ice cream and it was on his dessert. The waitress just brought him the ice cream he wanted, she didn't have the sundae remade.

Finally, the waitress told us that the manager wouldn't come to the table.She also provided incorrect change- $30 off. 

To top it off? The next day I was sick. Most likely there was a bacteria in chicken from being cooked and refrigerated."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in last night intending to have a drink or two, mind you this was a Tuesday night. We were able to skip right past the hostess without being greeted and sat down at the bar. The place had the majority of its tables empty and the bar was not overly packed which made it odd that 4 bar tenders were unable to acknowledge us even to give us a drink menu or take our order. 

We stayed for 10 minutes without anyone saying a word to us. Time to spend our money elsewhere. 

Bottom line the service is terrible and I can't report on the drinks because we were it able to try them. Go ANYWHERE else but here! Cleveland offers a wide range of great bars and restaurants... This however is not one of them."}
{"text":"Let's begin with, lousy service and overpriced drinks.  First and last time for me. I couldn't believe the poor service, we ordered drinks + food and it took forever to get both.  My wife's crepe arrived before the drinks we ordered first (30 minutes). 

When the drinks finally arrived at around 45 minutes, I was still waiting for my food (which never arrived because I cancelled after 1hour of waiting).  The server spilled some of the drink on my wife's shirt and never even apologized! He was rude and unprofessional, all he said was \"I'm not so good at this!\"    He also spilled some chocolate drink on my friend's arm next to me and didn't say anything or even offered extra napkins, we had to flag down a different waiter for napkins.  

I am very disappointed about this place, I had been told about \"how good drinks and dessert\" they have.....I feel like I got duped. 

Never again......."}
{"text":"Food isn't special. The drink menu is excellent! However, one star for you. Why would I do that? Well let me tell you, I dined there last night and had 1 drink the entire night and only at your establishment. After my meal, and as I left through your front door, your staff said goodnight. However, I failed to see any signs saying \"watch your step\", the staff did NOT say \" Goodnight and watch your step\" which you would expect. So as I was leaving I forgot about these useless stairs and tripped down them, caught off guard and left unsteady to balance my myself I laughed nervously and luckily didn't fall down. But as I laughed, the staff laughed and faced away. No one said are you ok, no one said so sorry that happened. I smacked my wrist against the doorway struggling not to fall and it was swollen and hurt the rest of the evening and honestly ruined my whole night. How could you have stairs there without anyone kindly saying watch your step as you leave? Or more noticeable signage? In fact, why are there clumsy stairs in the first place? I could have broke my wrist or an ankle. A lawsuit waiting to happen. Not happy. And your filet although cooked correctly was poorly seasoned,  it was terribly bland with only A1 sauce because your establishment lacks Worcestershire sauce and further lacks proper seasoning abilities."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was trendy but very comfortable, not too crowded, just what you'd expect from such a place. The staff was friendly and timely, and very accommodating for my husband, myself and our baby girl. That last part is important as parents with children will agree, but this place does so without turning into an Applebee's. The filet and peppercorn sirloin dish were both delightful, the baked Brie was decent but not excellent. The desserts are creative and definitely worth the trip, as well as artfully designed, although the ice cream is the generic cheap stuff."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hyatt Regency and came here two days in a row since it is at the bottom of the hotel. The first night we just got desserts and it took us about 10 minutes to even be greeted when we walked in. I got the chocolate mousse brûlée and thought it was really good, but the service was just okay. The next day we came back to try the actually food. The menu was extremely limited during the day so I tried ordering the breakfast flatbread without scallions. The waitress plainly told me there could be no alterations to the food. I asked if it was all pre-made and just heated up and she said no it's made fresh but I couldn't change anything. If the food was really made fresh I don't understand why they couldn't do something simple like not add scallions. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else since everything I wanted had at least one thing on it I didn't like. Refusing to make alterations with fresh food is extremely poor customer service, especially when your restaurant is empty. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The chocolate bar is an iconic spot in the Downtown Cleveland bar/restaurant scene. My fiancé (pictured) and I came today after a local sporting event. We arrived after the lunch rush but prior to dinner rush so they sat us within minutes. (As a side note, if you plan on dining after 4:00pm a reservation is a must if you want a table. If you do not reserve a table your only option will be the bar if there is any openings) Since we both were just eating light we both decided to order a flatbread. I can't remember the name of mine for the life of me, but it had shrimp and broccoli and it was perfect! My fiancé on the other hand didn't have the greatest experience. Her buffalo chicken flatbread was good, but had a couple notable displeasures. Firstly, the chicken was very dry. It stuck to your teeth when you chewed and secondly, the \"buffalo\" flavor was lacking punch. The sauce was very bland and lacked any spicy elements. Despite those two things, the flatbread itself was very good. Overall, we have never had a bad experience with the food. Next we should talk about the drink that is pictured. My fiancé ordered the mint chocolate martini, and let me tell you.. it was delicious! (After all, they do own the name chocolate bar) They have an extensive cocktail menu, and we've never had a bad one. I would always suggest asking your server their opinion of the best one. Lastly, desert... well there is really no need to elaborate other than GET DESERT! It doesn't matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. We got the chocolate lava cake and it was to die for. The chocolate bar = 2 thumbs up, a must try if you're downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place in a great location, but other than desserts the food is only so-so."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Chocolate Bar (wknd of March 30-31, 2013) after a movie with my wife and enjoyed the service, drinks and crowd. (Prompt service, drinks were good to OK. and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves, before moving on to the next.).

 Owner was kind and took time to have a nice conversation with my wife & I which should always go well with patrons & shows effort in continually striving for a successful business. Keep up the good work guys. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Never have been before. We came here for a martini and dessert. Couldn't complain. Everything was delicious. Except the fact that we were crammed into a table between two drunk families. One side was loud and obnoxious and the other side wanted to eat our desserts. So annoying. I got the dip your berries. Very good! I also had the espresso martini. Delicious. I would definitely come here for dessert and martinis. Couldn't complain. Our server, Atoyria, was very nice and efficient. Nice little spot in Cleveland. Very busy though!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch and it was delicious! I got the soup of the day which was a New York chowder of some sort and the chicken caesar salad which was HUGE. They were both great. My boyfriend got mac and cheese with chicken which was enough for about three people but super yummy. 

We were staying in the Hyatt Hotel which is connected to the Chocolate Bar and were super excited to go back for brunch on sunday mornings for mimosas and french toast! However, when we walked in Sunday morning they told us it was closed to the public for a wedding. Wish they had advertised this earlier so we could have made plans to go the day before. Overall, great meal though!"}
{"text":"The martinis are delicious and creative, but the food is lacking. Like other reviewers, I was hoping for a few more chocolatey choices in their entree selection. That aside, it would have been nice if the apps and entrees they do serve were better than mediocre.
I might come here for drinks, but probably not food."}
{"text":"Everything I purchased was absolutely delicious. I only got three desserts but omg yum. Not sure why this doesn't have better ratings."}
{"text":"I would like to review the desserts but I can't.
I stopped in to get two desserts to go and the hostess did greet me nicely but when I told her I wanted something to go she just said you have to wait here, which was in front of the pastry showcase. I kept waiting and no one came , then I saw two different servers putting desserts on plates and walking away, they never even acknowledged me. I asked the hostess again if someone would take care of us and she said one of them will and it was the servers who left. No one cam back, the hostess said nothing and there were three people behind me that was dessert to go, I finally just walked out. I don't care if I have to wait but to be totally ignored is inexcusable."}
{"text":"I was craving a milkshake, so we went to the Chocolate Bar!! $6 for a milkshake, or $12 for one with a shot... really - $6 for a shot of vodka into a milkshake.  Most overpriced place I've ever been to. $30, for two drinks and 15 minutes in the bar. 

Great to say, \"hey - I've been there.\" But will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"Just went there for a dessert and coffee. Loved the dessert. One negative (and suggestion to management) I told them it's my wife's birthday, they brought the shot of liquor in a chocolate cup and a candle and them they charged us $5! Left a bit of a sour taste in our mouth, it's like nickel and diming, most restaurants usually give something like that complimentary. Also, skip frozen hot chocolate, not worth it (but to their credit, when mentioned it to the server, it was taken off our bill). Those were the reasons why i couldnt give 5 stars. But overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Today I was walking around downtown Cleveland with a co-worker looking for a lunch spot and we stumbled upon Chocolate Bar.  Looked good and we were had only an hour so we ducked in to check it out.  They have good curb appeal with nice signage which probably got us in the door, inside is nothing too special but nice looking overall, sort of chain-y.  We were quickly seated and the waitress followed right behind, she was friendly and brought our waters and took our order with no issue.

I had the steak BLT which was panini style and tasty. The steak was tender and juicy, bacon not too fatty but crisp and overall taste pretty good.  A little too much basil mayo for me but some people like that.  My dining partner loved her fettuccine alfredo with prosciutto and mushrooms, I thought the prosciutto looked a little weird.  We had the molten lava cake as a dessert which was good, nothing out of this world but the presentation was very nice, it was served with fresh whipped cream, raspberry sauce, a chocolate dipped cream puff and a long chocolate spiral thing.  

I thought the prices were average but I could see others complaints when a martini costs more than a chicken sandwich.  We had no problems with service and as a lunch stop this seems like a good bet!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner and had a chicken salad and a hot chocolate alcohol drink. Both were very underwhelming and kind of flavorless.  Seemed like no thought was put into the dish or drink.  I came here another time a year or two ago, and remember thinking the same thing.  

When I first walked in, about 4 of the staff at the host's station had their backs turned to me for like 5 minutes, so I just went and found a seat myself.  Of course, nobody came over to give me a menu or anything so I had to get up and tell someone I was sitting there.  The place was basically empty.  Not a huge deal, but just seems careless. 

Would not recommend in light of the better options in that area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went during Patio Week to try out this much-talked about place.  Unfortunately, we never got waited on during a very slow period.  2 servers walked by us 2 or 3 times and never even acknowledged us or asked if we were taken care of.  Left without trying any martinis or food.  And during Happy Hour, you would think a few of their special chocolate drinks would be discounted, right???  Nope, no chance.  You can go to just about any bar during Happy Hour and get 1/2 off martinis, so why pay $10 for a martini here????  May give it one more try if we happen to be walking by the place and desparate for chocolate."}
{"text":"We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door.  They explained how brunch and dinner change over worked and told us exactly what was and wasn't available (which only certain deserts and french toast weren't available). We were able to order within 5 minutes of sitting down.

The ambiance is great with light jazz playing and has comfortable seats with backs (check out noodlecat review).  The menu is awesome.  We got the Ham and Cheese Panini, Chocolate Bar Breakfast, and Chocolate Supreme.  Delish! We were served within 15 minutes of ordering.  This is the best spot in Cleveland.  They may have redeemed our weekend vacation.

Sweet potato fries are the best I've had. If you like Great good, Wonderful atmosphere, Terrific staff, Excellent service, this is a must try."}
{"text":"Food was very good (sandwicha and flatbread pizza was what we had) and very reasonable.  Wide variety of cocktails but overpriced cocktails and beer."}
{"text":"Honestly, just from what I'd read I thought this would be a 1-star review.  Well, well, well Chocolate Bar I am impressed enough to not only grant you \"average\" status but return again to try some of your yummy desserts.  First of all, the layout in here is pretty good, especially for a big group.  We had a group of 10 who showed up unannounced and they had no problem seating us.  My only complaint?  The Lakers were playing OKC that night and I was taping the game and asked them to turn it to another channel and they wouldn't.  This is obviously very minor. I had one glass of wine when i went here because I was already drunk, tired and didn't feel like gearing myself up for a second wind simply bc I was at a \"bar of chocolate.\"  From what others at my table ordered -- and the extensive menu -- it looks like chocolate bar could be a good go-to for a quick dessert fix.  Looking forward to going here again."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the Chocolate Bar. One star for the name and another star for the decent Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini and Triple Fudge Cake I had. Other than that, this place is otherwise unremarkable.

When we first walked in, around 530 in the evening on a Wednesday during an Indians game, there were maybe three other tables occupied in the restaurant. We stood in front of the hostess station while a waitress rolling napkins attempted to avoid our gaze and four other waiters/waitresses walked by us. We stood there for literally...ten minutes until the waitress who was trying to avoid us by folding napkins was told to seat us. 

Perhaps it was our fault for not saying anything? 

No, their service is just really poor, and none of the employees there really care about customer service. 

While I was waiting for someone to notice my boyfriend and I, the ambiance of the restaurant is fairly nice. Dimly lit, a little classier feel to it but nothing remarkable. There is no parking, you have to park in a garage. The bathrooms are weird public bathrooms down the stairs and around the corner, also. 

It was happy hour, and their specials were not communicated anywhere online, nor shown anywhere on the menu... and our waitress did a poor job verbally explaining it. Their signature martinis are not part of happy hour, and ONLY SOME APPETIZERS ARE $4.95. The Chocolate Bar randomly picks week to week, or day to day, or maybe they choose it based on what you order. I'm not really sure.  

As for drinks, I love chocolate-based liquory nonsense drinks. I would really recommend a Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini, it was really well made, delicious, chocolately, and I couldn't taste the liquor. However, for my second drink I ordered a Nutella Martini, which was legitimately poorly made. It was not simply poured heavily, it did not taste like Nutella and the vodka was extremely apparent. I was really surprised they did not use Frangelico hazelnut liquor, or anything remotely resembling Nutella. I was also surprised that each Martini did not list the types of liquors in each. I personally think that the Hofbrauhaus has much better speciality dessert martinis for $8 (rather than $10 at the chocolate bar)

I did not have dinner, but I ordered a chocolate cake, and I have no complaints with it. It was rich, fudgey, yummy, but nothing I couldn't have gotten somewhere else. I can't remember what it was called, unfortunately. 

I don't really see a reason to come back here, particularly because of the service."}
{"text":"Reservation needed. Even with reservation, service was under staffed and slow. Drinks are fun, good and creative. Food and menu are typical of a chain restaurant. Seats were by the entrance and were not enjoyable because cold air kept blowing in"}
{"text":"I want to give it a 3.5 star rating don't know how to add the .5. This place is heaven for women. It's all chocolate. Try their chocolate martini. Simply delicious. The hot chocolate is yummy. The food is so so. The best thing though are the waiters t-shirts  with chocolate quotes on them. I am sure to buy one before I leave Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! My husband got the steak blt and I got the Mediterranean salad and we split it, amazing food and portions!!"}
{"text":"Chocolate everything! Tried the chocolate martini and some of their wines as well. I got one of the wine drinks blended with ice and I wasn't a fan, there were huge chunks of ice still in it and I was basically just eating ice cubes. The chocolate martini was rich and velvety though, but that was the only drink that  really stood out to me. They are a little on the pricier side."}
{"text":"What can I say .. The Chocolate Martini's are 5 star .. after that you are looking at Applebee's quality food.  So they suck you in but they don't season the food well and it is very bland.  The desserts must be great .. right?  No flavor ... I repeat no flavor!  How can whipped cream have no flavor.  Sorry, not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Best chocolate martini that I can remember. I had  the strawberry and wife had the salted carmel both were money and the edible straws topped it off. Perfect way to finish the night. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I went to the Chocolate Bar in search of a solid chocolate martini, delicious dessert and excellent service.  That's what I found and it was great!  As a solo traveler the bartender that was a local was very friendly and chatty and the martini I got along with the lava cake was amazing!  I didn't experience the dinner food but this is the place to go for a drink and sugar!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the location, and all of the drinks I had here tasted divine!

You gotta try the chocolate baguette, too. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with this restaurant.  I assumed it was all about desserts but the Yelp reviews piqued my interest.  I had the peppercorn steak that was very well prepared and for a very reasonable price.  The Caesar salad was completely forgettable, not having any distinctive flavor or zing.  I had the crèmes brûlée for dessert and it OK.  I'll certainly keep it on my list of go-to places in the city."}
{"text":"I ate at chocolate bar only for dessert to top off a wonderful night. However, after being seated we soon discovered that our waiter was not properly trained. He spilled the cappuccinos and mixed up our desserts. If you enjoy a sports style atmosphere while eating overpriced Applebee's grade dishes then you will definitely enjoy this subpar restaurant! The dessert tasted great as it was chocolate, I did eat all of my triple chocolate mousse. When I did go to use the restroom I was utterly disgusted. Not only was there no toilet paper to be seen, but only 2 out of 5 toilets worked and to top it off, part of the toilet paper dispenser was missing and I could see into the other stall. Thank GOD no decided to go in the stall or else they would be mortified. After flushing their extremely low flow lake water filled toilets, I discovered that the wall under the air dryer was moldy and the paint was starting to bubble underneath. At this point I didn't know if I was in a shitty episode of \"Flip or Flop\" or in The Arcade!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and have been pretty happy with both meals. The chocolate drinks and desserts are excellent. The food is pretty decent too, although not spectacular. Some mistakes were made with my meal (twice) the first time I went, which was pretty annoying, but overall I've enjoyed my experiences here enough to go back...although I'll probably focus on dessert whenever possible."}
{"text":"Everything we had was BLAND but the descriptions were so exciting. IT WAS SHOCKING! So bland. Even the dessert....at Chocolate Bar. I wouldn't recommend nor return. Short review for an underwhelming restaurant. Service was fine."}
{"text":"I just left the Chocolate Bar and I have never had such horrible service. We had a party and asked for the table next to us after we were seated, for the rest of the people who were coming. Our waitress was rude and made a host of comments and mumbling under her breath in regards to the people in the party. The waitress rushed us through the whole meal, was very condescending when we asked questions in regards to menu items. My friend got so upset with the service and asked for the manager. When the manager finally showed up, he said \" Everybody has a bad day\". Needless to say we will NEVER be gracing this establishment with our presence again!!! 

One more thing, the food and drinks were overpriced and not very tasty."}
{"text":"Service was normal speed but food was very cold. Manager was not accommodating of cold food because we had \"eaten some of it\". Offered $3 off.. 
WILL NOT BE BACK-wasn't even worth a 1 star"}
{"text":"This was a bizarre little place. They have a full regular menu, but the schtick is chocolate. The dessert menu and desserts were what we came for, so it was fine. I got the peanut butter mud, which I highly recommend, and my husband was happy with the flourless chocolate cake (which I wasn't--I've had better). He also liked his Swedish Fish Martini and my wedding cake martini was okay, but too rich and milky like to drink a whole one for me. Fun for dessert and drinks, but can't comment on the rest of the food!"}
{"text":"Okay food, very average at best. Great drinks, the fries were honestly my favorite part of the entire experience. The server was awful, very inattentive, forgetful, and seemed as if she avoided our eye contact when trying to get her attention. Would come back for fries, drinks, but would make sure to not have her as a server again."}
{"text":"I ordered the filet mignon, cooked perfectly.  My husband had the macaroni & cheese with chicken, which was also pretty good. Chocolate shooters were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is only good for their chocolate martinis, appetizers, and desserts. I went here with my girlfriends on several occasions and we tried the following martinis: Chocolate Chocolate Mint, White Chocolate, Raspberry Truffle, and Strawberry Cheesecake. The first three are deeelicious, the last one was okay. It didn't have the right consistency as the first 3. They all tasted as it sounds and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try this place out. I haven't tried any of the other flavors but these would be my favorite ones. 

On one occasion, we did also try their shooters. First, it is the most tasty shot because the holders are actually chocolate and we tried all the flavors: Ballys, Godiva Chocolate and White Chocolate, Espresso Vodka, Chambord, and Kahlua. Out of these, I'd say I liked the Godiva chocolate better only because I'm a big fan for Godiva chocolates as well. 

For appetizers, we had the tomato and fresh mozzarella, artichoke and spinach dip. The first one I wasn't too crazy for because literally it came with just the two. A drizzle of chocolate was presented as an addition but that didn't do much good because the dish didn't really have much taste. However, the dip was fantastic. The pita bread was toasted and in perfect temperature. 

For dessert, we had their crepes (banana foster) and their chocolate fondue. The crepes was pretty stacked with plenty of nutella and bananas. It was definitely sweet and for those who have a sweet tooth this dish is for you! The fondue was fun and plenty to share with your girlfriends. It had bananas, strawberries, and some other cookies/biscuits/dippables. 

This place is great for bachelorette and birthday parties as well as girl night outs. From my recent visit with a friend of mine, I ordered an oatmeal raisen shot and it was definitely a kicker. I believe it had baileys and gold schlagger. It had a ginger taste to it but it was really good. Chris and Paul, the bartenders for the night were really nice to us and gave us some free drinks to try out. This place doesn't disappoint me when I feel like getting some chocolate."}
{"text":"NO MANICURES & MARTINIS MONDAYS! The website takes reservations but they haven't offered it for over a year. Sign-up, show up and get screwed. No apologies. Update your site!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chocolate and chili martini-it was so good!! Got the artichoke dip as an appetizer which was very yummy. Main courses which were salads were just okay. Our waitress Maddy was great!"}
{"text":"All the cakes look interesting behind the glass, but frankly came out too dry both times I tried. I do appreciate the good services each visit though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some dessert and chocolate martini's. We were told they could not accommodate our group. Yet there were plenty of empty tables. They told us they were being held for people with reservations. We were a group of 15. The manager turned us down three times! A waitress by the name of Tyory came up to our group and said \"No problem! I got you.\" She set up a table and gave us spectacular service. Not sure what happened to all those people missing their tables cause they sure did not cause a problem over not having a seat! Tyory deserves a promotion! What manager turns down 15 people with about 40% of tables in the place empty? Hmmm! Now the food! The martini's are the best! So look out! You will be under the table before you know it! Stick to the fondue's and dipping desserts. Stay away from the banana split. Frozen pineapple and no syrups. The Peanut butter mud was mouthwatering! Three stars all for our waitress!"}
{"text":"I attended a dinner party at The Chocolate Bar and it was the worst experience I've ever had. Other than the presence of good company of the people I was with I can't say much nice about the place. First the server was totally awful, she was more concerned with where we sat other than attending to her patrons, we had to flag her down to receive anything, she didn't take drink orders from people as they came in , she never offered us the chance to order appetizers and when we did ask for something we were lucky to get it, I'm still waiting for a knife to cut my salad. I ordered a steak medium-well and it over well done and dry, she never came to check on us so I ate all I could tolerate of it. She did ask if we wanted dessert though. I must admit the chocolate milkshake was very good, but very overpriced. Until today I had never been in a eatery that refused to give separates check, they told us we all had to pay on one bill, either all cash or put on one person's credit card. That it the most ridiculous policy I ever heard of. It took us an extra 40 minutes for sort that mess out with people having to find an ATM for cash. People liked their martinis but nobody was impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Decadent desserts... a bit pricey for \"chocolate\" added to everything, from chicken to pasta... but hey, it's a theme restaurant...So you're paying for the \"experience\" -which is supposed to be 'seductive', but I was in town on business, very un-fun business, so seduction was the last thing on my mind.  LOL

At any rate, I'd definitely pop in again while in town to soothe a chocolate craving."}
{"text":"This was bad even for this place.  We stopped in at the end of the evening for a nice chocolate martini and an appetizer.  The service was slow, not her fault, but having more staff on the floor would have helped.  Our drinks finally show up and they are horrible.  Horrible!  Our appetizers come and we had to send two back.  One tasted like smoke and other smelled spoiled, was soggy and greasy.  We finally got to speak with a manager and nothing was done about it and he didn't  seem that apologetic.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I consider myself a chocolate connoisseur, so I was excited to go to chocolate bar for the first time for a friends birthday. That excitement quickly turned to frustration.
In regards to service, the hostess told us to wait a second when she went to see if a table was available for us in the back. She left, and then never came back to update us. Instead she went to the kitchen and we could see her washing dishes as we stood there waiting. Our waitress had no clue what she was doing. She struggled taking our orders for 15 mins, forgot to bring one of our drinks for AN HOUR, and messed up 2 orders, even after she had double checked on them. She also was not familiar with many things on the menu. We were still charged for the wayward drink and tip, (sadly) was included on the bill.
The food itself wasn't a real jaw-dropper, either. The cheesecakes were ok, with most effort spent on presentation. The Brownie Explosion sundae was of epic proportions, but the homemade ice cream didn't taste homemade. Martinis were served with ice, instead of strained, which made them somewhat frustrating to drink.
Personally, I'd recommend going to the Cheescake Factory instead if you're looking for great desserts. Cheescake Factory has a better selection, at the same quality and prices...and their service is far superior.
In conclusion, chocolate bar is just a gimmick restaurant with not much to back it up."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you're getting. We ordered: toasted ravioli, a wrap with chicken/hummus/kalamata olives etc., cinnamon bun milkshake, steak and stuffed pepper flatbread, and chocolate covered pretzel martini. The ambiance is very nice, darker with lit candles. Fun in that it's part of the arcade. My daughter loved the milkshake. The appetizer only had 5 ravioli on it. The wrap was pretty good, but didn't have much hummus in it. The steak on the flatbread was definitely something heated up and not sliced up fresh. The martini was alright. It was way too strong alcohol for my liking. I didn't even finish half of it, but had a very nice presentation lol. I doubt we would return, but was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Can you rate lower than one star? I went there Saturday 7/29 with my mom and sister before going to a concert at the Q. Ordered the filet med. rare and when it came out the bottom was so badly burned it was inedible. When I brought it to my waitress's attention she was barely apologetic and I asked for the salmon instead. 

After my family finishes their meal our waitress comes over to tell me that my dinner will be out soon (at this point I've already been waiting 15 minutes) but somehow the kitchen only prepared a half order of salmon instead of a full piece. She asks if I want to wait for the full piece but I'm starving at this point and say no. 

So I get my tiny lil salmon with two roasted tomatoes and pesto sauce (literally that was it) and 10 minutes after I finish that she brings out a piece of salmon on a plate. But that's it, just salmon on an itty bitty side plate. Really? Can't spare two more fucking tomatoes? I didn't eat the plain salmon. 

Check comes. My salmon is on the check! Never offered a discount, free desert, nothing! I'm not one to complain or ask for free food, but I've worked at 5 different restaurants in my life and I know how to treat the customer. When my mother asked for it to be removed from our bill she said we were lucky the one manager was there because any other manager would've made us pay for it. Excuse me?! If you've followed this far you can tell we weren't lucky at all 

Sub-par food, an incompetent kitchen, rude waitstaff and apparently sassy management this is a no go for us ever again. No need to waste almost $100 with these disastrous results. At least the concert saved the evening!"}
{"text":"four of us tried this place for lunch. I'd really like to find something positive to say about this place, but it's just not possible. silverware was wrapped dirty, side plates brought to table were dirty and actually had cheese and food smeared in between them.  spinach dip app was ok, but it came with two carrots and two celery stalks and 10 pieces of bread. we ordered it for the veggies so we asked for more. server was very nice and accommodating, but not very classy. brought 6 more veggie sticks on a side plate and there was literally dirt on the carrots and the celery was completely wilted.  lettuce in my salad clearly came from a bag and was not washed. it was also old, with those slimy purple gooey strands of lettuce all mixed in. I pray I don't get a parasite from picking through it, but I didn't want to complain since this was the place the guest of honor had chosen. salad dressing was sour due to non refrigeration. chicken on salad had a funky taste, and I was afraid to eat it. dessert was overpriced, but I tried it hoping it would good.  I chose what my server said was the absolute best. it was so bad we couldn't even eat it. stale, dry, and clearly bought from a cheap outside source. talking afterward, all four of us realized we had an equally terrible experience with equally awful food and food preparation. I've never written a review before on yelp, but I want to save anyone from going here. I'm not bothering to complain to the restaurant at this point (unless I get physically ill tonight), because I wouldn't eat anything from this establishment if THEY paid ME. I'm sorry to leave such an negative review, but it really was inexcusable in every way."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Bar is AMAZING. They have a mix of basically everything you could ask for. 

For drinks...
I was very skeptical about chocolate drinks like their peanut butter martini. Turner, our server, recommended all of our drinks to us and was so patient we love him. He treated us like guests in his own home I am so impressed at how great he was. I'm from out of town and very much appreciated the hospitality. Back to drinks though, we got the chocolate covered pretzel martini, blueberry mojito, and the wine flight. Everything was so good: presentation, taste, alcohol. The mojito was so refreshing and definitely always a good choice. The cholera martini was insane! It tasted like adult chocolate pudding or adult chocolate milk with the hint of vodka. It wasn't thick but it also wasn't watery. Definitely recommend. 

For food...
All of the food we got was really good. We got a salad, filet mignon, and more. The crepe was to die for. Everything so fresh and decadent without being overdone. 

Overall I would absolutely recommend. Dessert and drinks over food if you HAD to choose. But like we did, do both!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, drinks, and dessert on a week night.  Service was fine and we were instantly seated.

We got two drinks, a spiked hot chocolate and a spiked nutella something.  They were both pretty good, but pricy for what they were.  

For dinner we got the Mac and cheese and the noodle bar.  The Mac and cheese was pretty good but the noodles sauce was weirdly sweet and the chicken was dry.

For dessert we got some type of peanut butter sundae, which was good, but huge.

Overall I was happy with our visit but I wouldn't rave about it to anyone, its really probably 3.5 stars.   I could see stopping by for drinks again some time."}
{"text":"Great drinks, side dishes were delicious my steak would have been great but it was a little underdone, probably would have sent it back but we were in a rush to get to a show. All in all it was a great experience and we would return."}
{"text":"So, granted, we didn't have a lot of choices for dinner in this area on Labor Day, as our first few choices were closed, but choosing this place was a bit of a mistake.

Our server, Dominique, was GREAT, and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. The food, however, was not so great.

We started with bowls of french onion soup. Both of which were missing the promised crouton of bread under the cheese. Mentioned it to server, she apologized and brought some slices of bread to add. Soup was OK.

I ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken over pasta with peppers, basil, and caramelized onions. It was an absolute salt bomb. Server asked how it was, and I was honest. She apologized and offered to bring me some more of the \"lemon cream sauce\" it was drizzled with to try to cut the salt. I'm relatively sure that it ended up just being cold sour cream with a little lemon juice. It remained ridiculously salty.

My wife ordered the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. It was served garnished with some pita triangles that she said \"tasted like cold, wet dough.\" Salad was very overdressed and swimming in dressing, which somehow managed to not give any moisture whatsoever to what may have been the most dry chicken breast either of us had ever enxountered.

We skipped dessert/drinks.

I wasn't expecting a high-end meal. And as I said, our server was very friendly, attentive, and gamely did her best to try to fix what ended up being aggressively bad food."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's a friendly and lively environment. Great service! Located in the heart of Cleveland . Good place to chill and watch sports on several TV screens. You can't go wrong with any of the desert or salad menu. Try it then walk it off and enjoy downtown."}
{"text":"Went for a bachelorette party, the food wasn't good and the two chocolate drinks I had were decidedly average. The only positive thing about it was that the prices were good. Don't go with high hopes."}
{"text":"My company and I came here several times for dinner. The food items do sound appealing but always ends up pretty average. Once time, I got the white chocolate martini which ended up very delicious. If you end up dining here, I recommend trying their alcoholic beverages that contain chocolate. I also recommend making a RSVP because the waiting line tends to be long."}
{"text":"Like Megan G we had Dmitry as a server. I use the term server lightly because he didn't do much to service us. He walked up to our table upon arrival, stared at us and waited for us to tell him what we wanted. In our 10 minutes at the table he said all of 3 words to us. Our drinks were awful and we each only took a few sips. Upon getting the check he didn't bother asking why we wanted to leave having not even drank our beverages. Worst server ever!

We were also told by the host that the kitchen was closed so I asked about dessert and he said it was not available. After we sat we saw deserts coming out of the back and headed to tables. Clearly desert was actually available but they didn't feel like giving it to us.

Chocolate Bar's saving grace was their incredibly apologetic and attentive manager who insisted we let her make us new drinks and brought us dessert on the house. The drinks came back wonderful and the dessert was also very good. Had it not been for the manager we would have vowed never to go back."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night. I was greeted and seated promptly by a very friendly host. The server came and introduced herself and explained the menus and was very friendly. I was impressed by the selection of drinks (both alcoholic and non) and the amount of entree selection. I chose to have the pesto salmon. Presentation was on point. Execution was not. The salmon was not fresh and was soggy in the middle. The asparagus had a charred taste. For desert I had the creme brulee done table side. Again, presentation was on point. Sadly execution was again lacking. There was no crack that all creme brulee fans look for when first digging in. The desert itself seemed loose as it became more like eating vanilla baby food/pudding than a creme brulee. It was not the worst meal I've had in Cleveland but not the best."}
{"text":"The four stars is including an extra star for handling our lame-ass situation with almost zero attitude.

The Chocolate Bar is the kind of place you'd have expected to see back in the early supper club days of the 1930's. Decor and styling is really cool. A nice job...and, a great spot, having street frontage and also a side exit to the Grand Arcade...which is truly one of the city's great landmarks. 

Being attached to a hotel pretty much means it has to maintain a certain \"non-hole-in-the-wall\" look and attitude. I get that, 100%. It's not the normal kind of place I'd hit up, but it's not insulting or horrifying as several previous posters have striven to convey.

We didn't get a chance to eat, having been booted from our reservation spot due to lame-ass no-shows (the place was PACKED)...but, we did down some beverages at the bar, after being offered and declining a smaller table. 

As long as I was there, I decided to test my heterosexuality by ordering a chocolate martini. Pretty damn tasty...I'm sure there are better ones to be had, but it had a ton of flavor and was fairly generous with the spirits. 

If you're looking for a spot that has water-damaged ceiling tiles, a toilet that's constantly running and broken tiles along the walls, this is NOT YOUR JOINT.

If you want a clean, sleek, styled joint...that's not too expensive...whose desserts are gigantic...then give it a try."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the Ski Country sandwich, because since having it at my first visit I can't get enough of it! The maple mayo is to die for! You'll put that s*** on everything!"}
{"text":"whats not to like chocolate and alcohol and cavs game very unique  go for it. may be a one in done but loved it anyway."}
{"text":"Chocolate Bar is the VERY WORST RESTAURANT IN CLE. Owner's rude arrogance is why it should be avoided!
Staff was terrific. Then the food came, which was mostly okay, except for the Bananas Foster Crepe which was like bananas wrapped in leather - that tough the crepe itself. So I requested the server to change it, who called the manager, a short dark haired woman, who instead of apologizing interviewed me about deficiencies of the crepe, then went to \"talk to the chef\". After about 10 minutes returened to say, \"this is how we make them\". I asked so I am forced to eat what I do not like and MARIE the manager/ co-owner said to my request for replacing the awful thing, \"we cannot change it, replace it or take it off bill\"
If they do not go out of business that will be a miracle based on ridiculous level of tolerance of people - but seriously a HOSTILE OWNER/ OPERATOR is the worst thing at any establishment as that means zero recourse to fairness"}
{"text":"The food is average. My salmon had a very fishy taste. The presentation was nice. Do not get the ice wine. It's not a sangria, it's ice in a blender with wine. So the only way to drink it is eat the ice like a slushy. 
The pecan chicken was pounded very thin. The crepe was good,  canned whip cream. 
The place was packed on a Monday night.  We asked twice and waited more than 10 minutes to have our card run for the check. 
All the food is heavy and over the top."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a bachelorette dinner and from the time we got there, it was a less than stellar experience. Although they were able to seat us early, the service was consistently horrible. 

With a group of ladies coming in for a bachelorette party, it would be expected that we'd order multiple rounds of drinks. Never once did our waiter come and check for drink refills, and he never cleared our empty drinks unless we asked. 
We had a long table and he had us shout our orders across the table instead of coming around the table to take our orders. He made it seem as if it was a chore when I asked him to come over near me so he could hear my specific order due to a food allergy. When our food was brought, 3 orders were wrong and the specific thing I had ordered due to a food allergy was wrong. My salad had a hair in it.. when I said \"my salad has a hair in it\" his response was \"well it ain't mine\" as if I was directly accusing him. Instead of taking the plate away immediately and fixing the problem, he bantered back and forth with me debating who's hair it is instead of taking care of it right away.  When I later spoke with the manager who I had made the reservations through, he said that our waiter was his best.. pretty sad if this guy was his best waiter. 

Overall the food was so-so and the service was some of the worst. With dinner, and only about 3 drinks per person we were there just over 2 hours. I'd go to another spot right down the strip and avoid this place all together!"}
{"text":"2nights - mixed bag, and service that went from blasé to crappy   First night was a Saturday night and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. The Mexican pork tenderloin was a well made bargain but our waitress was almost as slow as the service she was getting from the bar. 

Wound up back there the next night with other friends around 9 pm, sitting at the bar. Asked for a menu - the guy next to us was just getting food. Our sourpuss bar tender gave us a menu. 15 minutes later when we could flag her back to our end of the bar to try to order, she told us she couldn't put food orders in after 9.  Then it took another 25 minutes to get her back to close out our tab. It was the closest I ever came to walking out on a tab.

Great concept, great food and drinks. Service so bad you should skip it until management does something about it  

For the love of Pete when you have a party of 4 or 6 come into your establishment and start ordering $10 Martinis all around, take care of them so they stick around and order several rounds instead of making them suffer to get one round in the time they wanted 3."}
{"text":"We had desert at the restaurant a few years ago and the service was very slow. We tried to make reservations for a party of 15 and were told that we had to put a deposit down of $500, and the credit card would be charged if the bill did not add up to $500. This seems very inflexible for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there on St. Patricks day, so it was really busy as expected. I got one of the shooters, which are the Belgian chocolate shot glasses containing chocolate liqueur. They were kind of small, but delicious. I also got a chocolate martini which was excellent. I am definitely going to go another time when its not so busy and try another one of their many chocolate martini flavors."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. At times, too friendly.  Besides the waiter, the manager and the owner both visited our table to check on us!  Did we look famous and not realize?  And I have to ask, are you or are you not kid friendly? Odd setting for the idea that the martinis and even some of the dishes are chocolate based.  My 9yo son was with us and he had a fantastic hot chocolate, yet it was a real toss up as to whether you could call it a bar or a family/bar restaurant. Seriously confusing with a bar crowd by the back entrance (by the Grand Arcade) and dining tables with families at the front street entrance. 

Admittedly, I did love the chocolate martini's and may have had one too many trying to generously sample the goods.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dessert with my friends before we rushed to the airport. We shared a triple chocolate mousse which was really good. I'm usually not a huge chocolate fan because it gets too heavy but this was just the right amount of chocolate and not too sweet. We also each got a frozen hot chocolate (first time having one!) and I really enjoyed it. Looking back, I probably should've just said no whipped cream since I'm not a huge fan of it but I can see why frozen hot chocolate is popular."}
{"text":"Food:  We wanted to have dinner here but the kitchen was closed by the time we got here so instead we ordered and shared 4 desserts:
1) Chocolate Dipped Strawberries - the strawberries were large and sweet but the chocolate was just OK.  I was annoyed that it wasn't the type of chocolate that hardens because that's the best part of chocolate strawberries!
2)  Sinnamon Ice Cream - basically a cinnamon ice cream sundae.  The ice cream was very good but there was way too much chocolate sauce.
3)  Peanut Butter Mud - I didn't really know what to expect here but the cake part tasted stale and the peanut crunch was just OK.
4)  Frozen Hot Chocolate (Aztec) - Maybe I shouldn't have gotten the spicy hot chocolate at a place like this but I did and it was too spicy (and not the right kind of spicy.)

Service:  It was fine.  They were closing so we were somewhat ignored while they started cleaning and stacking chairs, but that's not necessarily a bad thing at least until you want the check.

Value:  Expensive.  It came out to just under $50 for 4 desserts, no drinks, and tax and tip.

Atmosphere:  We sat outside because it had finally cooled off a bit but it was in Downtown Cleveland which is not a very nice area at night.  There were lots of hookers at the next corner so that was entertaining at least.

CONCLUSION:  A surprisingly expensive place for bad desserts in a not very nice part of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place.  Rude wait staff and expensive fare.  Most of their specialty drinks are available elsewhere.  Do no patronize this place!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a three stars for their super tasty Nutella and peanut butter cup martinis. Those are the only things I've found remotely delicious out of everything I've had here. 

Service is always lacking. I think the management is also super rude. I came in last night for my birthday with three other people and was told there was a two hour and forty five minute wait when half of the restaurant was empty, so I gave the manager my name and he put me on the \"wait list.\" I didn't care too much because I wanted to bar hop on East 4th anyway, and figured we'd come back when our table was ready. 

I came back and got the martinis I love and this time I ordered the strawberry \"plate\" that has a martini glass filled with chocolate to dip it in. They only give you six strawberries and a huge martini glass filled to the brim with chocolate and charge you $9!! ABSURD. 

I definitely feel this place is overhyped, and the food I've ordered prior to last night was mediocre at best. If you just want a martini definitely check this place out, but don't come with high expectations!"}
{"text":"Living in Cleveland, I've always heard of the Chocolate Bar, but haven't stepped foot in the building until a couple weeks ago. Happy Hour is awesome and I recommend getting the sweet potato fries as an appetizer! I'm not the biggest fan of sweet potato fries and I ended up really enjoying it with their 3 dipping sauces, maple mayo, chipotle lime mayo and dark chocolate. Their Italian sandwich with chips hit the right spot. The meal portions are huge and honestly big enough for two people to share! And since this place is called the Chocolate Bar, I had to try the chocolate! Their strawberries and hot chocolate dip is amazing. I even took a couple sips of the chocolate after finishing our strawberries, it was that rich! Overall, the prices are very reasonable for the meal portions and the atmosphere is low key!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place to eat. I got a kick out of the original Willy Wonka movie playing, both because I love the movie and it's called the Chocolate Bar. How fitting! It's a great location, with an indoor entrance from the Arcade and an outdoor entrance from East 4th. It's hard to ask for a much better location than that.

While I don't think this restaurant compares to the high-end dining of Lola, it is an interesting place to try. First off, the drinks are expensive, but delicious. Had the chocolate mint martini and it was awesome. Definitely had some kick, but still was delicious.

I can't speak much to how their smoked chicken was or anything like that. It's called the chocolate bar, not the smoked chicken bar, so I got the white chocolate pasta dish with some chicken added. It really took focus to eat it. It looked exactly like alfredo sauce, so if I wasn't thinking, my mouth would expect it to taste cheesy, and the sweet chocolate flavor would catch me completely off guard. But if you could convince yourself not to expect a cheesy flavor, it was actually very good. It still had some italian spices in it, and everything was well cooked. It was a good meal and was very unique.

I didn't get a chance to try any desserts, but they looked delicious. As a full-blown chocoholic, this restaurant is certainly appealing. i wouldn't go here looking for fine-dining, but for a fun time with friends, some good drinks, and a bit of chocolaty food, go for it."}
{"text":"I have been to Chocolate Bar more times than I can count. Living downtown, it has always been the perfect place to celebrate a birthday/girls' night out. The menu is extensive (think Cheesecake Factory) and has something for everyone. The flatbreads, pastas, and sandwiches are all great.

The main attraction, though? The wonderfully delicious and decadent chocolate martinis! At $10.00 a pop, they can quickly add up- but they are more than worth it. My personal favorite is the chocolate covered strawberry. 

Chocolate Bar is a great downtown option for bachelorette parties, girls nights, birthdays, etc. It's location is superb- right across the street from East 4th and within walking distance of the casino. It's also right next to a trolley stop for those who live downtown."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere ! Amazing selection of food and drink for chocolate lovers! I had the lady Godiva chocolate mousse and the chocolate strawberry martini. Which were both amaaazing. Our waitress was wonderful as well. Total I spent about 18$ which is a bit pricey but there are other options and this is definitely a treat! I'll be back !"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in the Sunday brunch. The service was very slow, and food was not up to par. The breakfast flatbread was less than desirable, and others did not receive the correct orders. We also were denied the ability to get separate checks because \"they were too busy\". Overall not a pleasant experience and we will likely not return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here after a comedy show or dinner on East 4th. They are usually able to accommodate us without hesitation. I can't say much about their food, it's been years since I've had a meal here. However their desserts are quite good. We usually order something different each time, so far we've had creme brulee, triple chocolate mousse cake, Belgian chocolate mousse cake, red velvet, and their bananas foster crepes. My favorite from this is the Belgian chocolate cake due to having a dark chocolate flavor. Their cake slices are moist and generously sized; enough to share for two. They are usually garnished with a chocolate stick, strawberry, and whipped cream. Their desserts aren't too unique hence why it's just A-OK."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Server talked to his buddy for 10 minutes and check on 2 of 5 tables while our beer bottles were empty. If your into blue drinks in martini glasses, this is your place. Anyone else's, keep moving. 3 out of the four of use felt sick that night and/or the next day. Go there for if you want only  a desert and not want it to leave/get service for a long time."}
{"text":"Went here for a Bachelorette party on a Saturday night with about 10 girls. Chocolate is their specialty; food is not so much their specialty. My friend and I split the chocolate fondue and the potsticker appetizer. The chocolate fondue was great and the potstickers were fine. Nothing to write home about. Another girl in our group got the nachos and there were way too many nachos and not enough toppings.  They also put corn on their nachos. I've never heard of putting corn on nachos before. 
For a large group, I'd recommend getting one of the jumbo martinis which is $40 because it serves about 7 people and is cheaper than each person getting a $10 martini. We ordered the salty caramel chocolate martini which was like an adult chocolate milkshake!  The espresso martini was very strong and not quite as enjoyable as the previous caramel chocolate martini."}
{"text":"Went for brunch.  It took 40 minutes to get the food and the the food was cold.  My partner's salad was wilted.  They said they were short staffed in the kitchen.  I would pass on this place for food.  I might try it to see if I can get a martini quicker then 40 minutes.  Sorry Cleveland, but this is not a winner for me."}
{"text":"Happened to head to Chocolate Bar one Saturday evening, as other restaurants on E4th St were busy. 
As chocolate lovers, their ice-cream milkshake with malt is to die for. Their hot chocolate was also fantastic. 
Sat at the bar, as the tables tend to get filled up quickly on weekends. The food was quite good- although not enough to get 5 stars. Ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread and it was (unfortunately) soggy and crumbled in my fingers - couldn't hold it well enough. 
Service was fantastic; even though it was busy, the staff were courteous and took care of us very well.
We look forward to going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after work, before a Colors and Bottles painting party on site.  The place was not busy at all but the service was horrid. The waiter did not seem to care and was not very attentive.  The meals were slow to be served.  The server never got our checks and after 2.5 hours at the painting party we had to ask for checks by going to the bartender.  Then we had to wait a REALLY LONG time to even find the server and then to get the checks.  They had the nerve to add a 18% service charge/tip to the bill and when we complained (because of the poor service), the waiter came back and did not even understand what we were complaining about and tried to give us another bill.  In regard to the food, my hot chocolate was lukewarm and the entree (fettucini alfredo) was very bland.  I would not recommend this place for a dinner and if you do go, I would be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service, good food. We tried the Chocolate Bar as it was one of the few places open on Labor Day. We were greeted promptly, our server was terrific, and everything we tried was good quality. The baguette with chocolate and a nice fruity olive oil worked well, though the chips on the side seemed unnecessary. The sweet potato fries were excellent, and paired well with the lime chipotle dip and chocolate, our salads were fresh and tasty, and the chocolate mousse dessert was light and... chocolatey. If I was going to nitpick, I'd say it was a touch too sweet for my taste. But I want to call out the service particularly, as other reviewers have had bad experiences on that front. We were very happy with ours."}
{"text":"Stopped for dessert after a play, around 11 on a weeknight -- 2 families, with a total of 8 in our party.  We had sweet potato fries and a few desserts, so I cannot comment on their dinner menu.  
Everything we had was very good.  Service, however, was practically nonexistent, although the servers seemed to be having a great time talking amongst themselves.  We had to flag someone down for water refills, for our bill, to pay our bill... you get the idea.  But for a late-night dessert spot right downtown, it was a winner overall."}
{"text":"In preparation for a dinner at Chocolate, I read several reviews in hopes of getting a glimpse into where I was dining. I wish I had allowed the negative reviews to hold water. 

There is one item that was great at Chocolate; the drinks. I do believe they pour the liqueur with a heavy hand in hopes that one will be too relaxed to care about the rest of the experience. 

The food was not good. The mac-n-cheese that other reviewers raved about was mediocre at best. Everyone makes good mac-n-cheese at home. If it is on a menu, it needs to be superior. Don't offer me a prosciutto add-on and sneak in a different ham-like product. 

At one point our waitress took the Parmesan cheese and pepper flakes off our table and gave them to another table, without asking if we were finished using them. Interesting approach to customer service. 

The dessert of selected shooters was not impressive. Nicely presented, but no flavor. I suppose if I was only going to look at the desserts I would have been happy. 

Our bill came only after I sought out the manager to print the ticket. I had to explain that 2 hours for a basic meal, not fine dining, was a bit much. 

Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"Chocolate Bar was filled with bachelorettes the night I visited! We found 2 seats open at the bar and ordered the white chocolate raspberry and chocolate orange martinis ($10 each). The white chocolate one was by far the best. Upon my first order of a key lime pie martini my bartender told me he did NOT recommend that flavor - thought I'd share!"}
{"text":"Great concept, good space, and it all centers around chocolate ... how can it go wrong?  It really can't and doesn't.  Had the Peanut butter sundae and it was fabulous, everybody else enjoyed their chocolate concoctions and the server was as friendly and good as the deserts.  Have never had the food so can't comment on it."}
{"text":"We met friends from Indy in Cleveland for a weekend. We stayed at the Hyatt and the Chocolate Bar was right there with an outside seating area. The weather was perfect to sit outside and have cocktails. The service was the best we had received in Cleveland. (We must be use to a faster service time standard.) The girls who served us Thursday night were very warm and friendly. Katelyn was one but there were a few others that stopped by throughout the evening. Delish desserts and cocktails. The martinis - Chocolate Mint and Chocolate Macaroon - were SO good. First time having Chocolate martinis. I wanted more the next night, but it was chilly. The hot chocolates we had were tasty but I'm not so sure about the alcohol. 
Desserts were Snickbocher, Turtle Cheesecake, Oreo Mud, Belgium Chocolate Mouse and Triple Chocolate Fusion. (over two nights, don't judge ;) )  All desserts score high on the deliciousness scale with the exception of the Turtle Cheesecake. Skip it and go with something else."}
{"text":"Second night visiting, superb service, and a delightful appetizer!! Plus milk and cookies!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambience! Perfect place to relax after a long day of travel, Even if the food wasn't the main attraction to look forward to, I reckon.
We enjoyed the service and the friendly behavior of the waitresses :) 
The price was quite reasonable too"}
{"text":"We came here just for dessert because I wanted chocolate. Well whT better than a chocolate bar. Order brownie explosion or something close to that name. Delicious are it all with the help of my hubby. Waitress was quick and nice!! Would come back and try something else!!"}
{"text":"Visited August 2013

I knew I wanted to stop here on our trip. We made it a point to locate this place...thank goodness! My husband had the chocolate chocolate mint martini, my mother-in-law the raspberry ruffle truffle & I had the chocolate fusion. They were all incredible! If I ever make it back I would like to try one of their frozen hot chocolates!"}
{"text":"Thier desserts are really good, but I wish they had more room for parking outside and thier food wasn't so expensive, otherwise I would go more often. I had the cinnamon ice cream and it was delicious, especially since I'm a huge fan of cinnamon! As far the the alcoholic drinks and desserts, they had a large variety to choose from so if you're looking for something sweet, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I have a visceral response to whenever someone suggests The Chocolate Bar. I have yet to have a good experience here. In the most recent visit, I ordered a Bourbon. I asked for it neat: literally bourbon in a glass with nothing else. After 15 minutes and as others from my table received their drinks, I had still not gotten my drink. The server asked if I really wanted that drink. Seriously. 

25 minutes into the meal, I got it. Poor service aside, I still question the quality of the chocolate. To me, it's chalky, and bland - far from the velvety, rich, and vibrant chocolate that is in many other dessert and confectionaries in the area. Volume chocolate seems to be the name of the game here. 

The Chocolate Bar just is simply not my thing."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about the Chocolate Bar is their sweet potatoes with the trio of dipping sauces (rosemary butter, chocolate dip and a mayo sauce). I've gone there a few times solely to get this appetizer. My second favorite thing about the Chocolate Bar is their martinis. They have every type of chocolate combination that they turn into a martini such as, mint chocolate chip, dark chocolate, chocolate and peanut butter, s'mores, etc. They're thick, they're rich, they're delicious!! Their portion sizes of food are very generous. I love the buffalo chicken cobb salad, as well as, the spinach salad. It's best to go on a warm day when you can sit on the patio and people watch on Euclid Ave."}
{"text":"Beautiful scenery. Martinis are tasty. Service was great. The food was not good however. Had a filet mignon and it comes with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Filet mignon tasted very bland. No flavor as well as the rest of what was on the plate. They need to invest in some seasonings to make the dish taste better. The potatoes were cooked thoroughly however lacked flavor. The asparagus was was bland and not cooked done enough. I added a crap load of salt n pepper n steak sauce to the steak yet it still didn't do it justice. For a $18.95 plate u would think it would taste a lot better. I asked for the manager to let him know my opinion on the dish. He came off very rude and had an attitude towards me. He claimed I ate half of my steak when I took two bites out of it n said he doesn't give discounts to people and that he sells 55 plates of these a night n doesn't receive any complaints. I let him know I wasn't looking for any discount just wanted to let him know about my plate. He seemed very frustrated and couldn't take constructive criticism. But over all I would not come back to get any food and wouldn't recommend anyone to do so either. But if u want a nice martini this is the place to go. I would rate this place with two stars but I gave it an added star for the waitress."}
{"text":"Went to The Chocolate Bar after seeing Wish You Were Here at The House of Blues. First off, I have never had a chocolate martini, so I asked if there was a way to taste one and the bartender lady says, \"sure if you purchase one\". Well thanks, but I was hoping to try a sip before ordering a whole one. Nevermind, but it may be a good idea to try tastings, like you get at a winery. Anyway, we had a nice time and tipped our server well. We were promised that a taxi would arrive in a few minutes and went outside as it was closing time. So we hear the door lock and no taxi ever arrives...we end up standing in freezing rain and hubby had to order a uber. Thankfully they actually showed up. You would figure it would be easy to get a taxi in cle...but it sure sucks when you get locked out without the promised taxi. Hope we don't treat the RNC people like that. We were going to go back for brunch but we spent our money elsewhere (Lago and it was very good) Edited: now that I am home, on my computer, I see on the online menu, they offer Martini Flights...3 mini versions of our incredible martinis and fresh berries. Wonder why she didn't offer that to me."}
{"text":"This place has fine dining aspirations but ultimately has that \"plastic fern bar\" , Cheesecake Factory  feel.  I have a low tolerance for  bad management decisions.  This place pushed my hot button - twice.  First, asked for a pepper grinder and after 10 min wait was told the only one was broken and had been for some time.  Inexcusable.  Second, ask for coffee and was told the coffee maker was broken, again for some time.  I asked for an espresso at the coffee price and was told no - the  manager had denied several other diners the same request.  I can tolerate inexperienced servers, mediocre food, and horrible 80s rock blaring too loud but idiotic decisions by management guaranteed to alienate - never ever again."}
{"text":"We shared peanut butter panic and peanut butter mud. Yes, we kind of like peanut butter! The panic was a massive ice cream glass that could be enough for 3 people. The mud was a smaller piece of cake but so, so, so good! It's crunchy, not too sweet and just so perfect! Also, our waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"Food wise, I would give the Chocolate Bar more of a 3, but desserts are a 6 out of 5!

They're Molten Lava cake is to die for, as are their martinis.

I loved the make your own smores, chocolate fondue, etc.

The prime rib was good, but not too flavorful.  My date had a chicken dish, which was again good but lacked some flavor.

This is definitely my favorite place for dessert!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the strawberry chocolate martini. Our bartender \"johnny\" (I think that was his fake name) lol he was a great guy, very accommodating. I wish we would've had time to grab dinner, the food smelled delicious."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice and had a great experience both times.
The only disappointment has been that there are really not that many dishes on the menu with chocolate in them (white chocolate pasta, chocolate baguette and I think a cocoa rubbed pork dish). I would expect a lot more ingenuity there.

But all the food I have had here has been great. Love the chocolcate baguette and the chocolate pasta. Usually when you find a restaurant there is maybe 25% of the menu I really want to try, 50% I'd like and another 25% I would pass. Here, about 90% of the menu is foods I love (like ham sandwiches with fruit, candied pecans, goat cheese, etc etc). Maybe it's just my particular taste but I have loved everything here. 

Food is not that expensive and portions are reasonable. Both times I have been here for an early dinner (around 4-5pm) so it's not that crowded and service is decent."}
{"text":"Been to Chocolate Bar twice now--twice for lunch and once for after-work drinks.  The restaurant has a nice central location for downtown Cleveland, and I was impressed how they remodeled and added their own touches to the old Vivo space.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (the Gene Wilder version) was running on some flat screen TVs, which I thought was a nice touch.

The food is alright, but I wouldn't call it anything special.  For the first lunch, I had the Turkey Berry, which is a turkey sandwich with a nice raspberry mayo.  The second time I had the Mac-and-Cheese Bar with grilled steak and caramelized onions.  The dish was really sub par.  I've had better frozen food mac-and-cheese from Stouffers.  For drinks, I had a flight (I won't say how many were in the flight...) of half-shots of Kahlua served in little, edible, chocolate shot cups.  Those were pretty good and certainly not something you can get many places in Cleveland.  I had the shots accompanied by their Belgian Chocolate Mousse Cake on the recommendation of the bartender.  It was...okay, but I had slightly higher expectations from a place dubbed \"Chocolate Bar.\"

Service-wise, lunch was a little uneven.  Perhaps they are still working out the kinks, but my lunch the second time was a disaster.  There was a long wait after our orders, and finally when we piped up, our food was brought right out--as if it were just sitting there the whole time.  Despite that, we asked to see dessert menus after our meal--surprisingly, that was another long wait.  In fact, the wait was long enough that we just decided to forgo dessert altogether.  The chocolate cake from the third time I went also seemed to take a bit too long to finally get to the bar.  Hopefully these things will be worked out; I hope to see improvements the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. We only came for deserts and got a cookies and creme Sunday and the brownie explosion. None of them were really that good. The cookie itself was kind of hard and tasted store bought. The other brownie Sunday was nothing special. Nothing like Mitchell's or Malleys ice cream bar. Maybe their sundaes aren't their strongest suit but I probably wouldn't go again. I think collosal cupcakes is a better dessert choice for late night."}
{"text":"The ambiance is VERY wrong for what they are trying to do.  They need to dim the lights and make it a more romantic atmosphere.  There is nothing sexy about bright artificial light causing the place to glow from the street. 

But  -  the drinks are good."}
{"text":"Nooooooo! I'm giving a negative review to a place based on chocolate! How could this be? Am I in the Twilight Zone?

I was in Cleveland for a conference when I visited Chocolate Bar, a franchise restaurant, along with three friends. The peanut butter cup martini was delicious but so sickly sweet that I (and this really says something) couldn't finish it. I also tried the chocolate peppercorn soup. Where was the peppercorn? It tasted like a cup of chocolate fondue or chocolate pudding being cooked on a stove. Again, it was sickly sweet. I also ordered a sandwich that had nothing to do with chocolate. It was the Tuscan, which is a type of sandwich I usually love (fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes). However, it just wasn't as good as similar sandwiches I've had at other restaurants. I think the problem for me was the bread. This is a sandwich that belongs on baguette with crispy outside crust and a soft interior, but it was served on white bread that was one step above Wonder Bread. My friends also were not impressed with their food, and their encounters with chocolate items also left them feeling a bit ill.

This is not a joke or an exaggeration. We stopped at Jake's down the street on the way back to our hotel, and each of us bought a packet of Alka-Seltzer. That, in itself, defines our experience at Chocolate Bar. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Hello,
I just finished dining at your Cleveland location, and it was not good service. I ended up feeling very uncomfortable after the experience.
I took my mother to lunch and the server, C. A. (I won't disclose his full first  name) was dismissive at the start of our visit. We paid it no mind. It was not until we ordered our food, and my mother was not satisfied with her salad and wanted to send it back in exchange for something else, when C. became indifferent. He told us that he \"will send his manager over\" without asking about why she didn't want her salad or apologize that it she was not satisfied with it.
The manager comes over and is very cut and dry about the situation. We paid that no mind because my mom and I understand how awkward it becomes when not liking food at restaurants and did not want to bring negativity to the situation.
Our server C. come back with a replacement cheesecake and check. Does not check back in with us. I ask for a box, to which he brings me but does not box my food the way he boxed the other table he was serving. Not once did he apologize for our experience, nor did he explain our check to us. I was paying for the food we sent back instead of the replaced item (a piece of cheesecake). C. gets his manager again because says to us in a disheveled tone, \"...I don't know what's going on\". The manager comes back and says, \"you'll probably pay more for the cheesecake than you would for your entree.\" This was his explanation for us  not understanding our check. That was not explained to us beforehand, so when my mom and I asked for clarification he spoke in a tone as if we were unintelligent about the itemized check.
After reflecting on the experience, I decided to not leave a tip. It was not a pleasant experience worthy of any tip.
As my mom and I walk outside, the server C. comes out after us to ask, \"I told you I would go get the manager and I did... I just want to know did I do something wrong? I noticed you didn't leave anything for a tip...because I did go get my manager.\" As I began answering his question I am cut off with an explanation of the importance of him getting tips because working in the service industry \"...tips are the only way we can go and take care of our families. This is how I make my living\" My mom began to agree with him about the industry, then answer his question of what he did wrong, but was once again cut off with justification in him sending his manager over to us. C. did not come outside to be apologetic or to ask for suggestions on how to improve his serving, but to let customers know that he was not satisfied with the tip we did not leave and that he is deserving of something because he sent his manager over. Some other people began walking through us and he began to hold conversations with them, dismissing us once again. He must not have liked what we did (or didn't get to) say
Overall, I was frustrated and really uncomfortable having a stranger come out after us after the service was over. That's never happened before. His manager was not part of that exchange so I don't know is the manager told C. to come after us or not.
I feel I wasted my lunch and do not intend to dine there again if C. is present.
I hope the establishment takes this review to heart, and brings it to the server's attention."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. We had a reservation for 6 at 8pm and when we got there they didn't have a table for us. Then, we got seated under a dripping ceiling, which our waiter did nothing about when we brought to his attention. Speaking of our waiter, he was rude from the moment we sat down. Two people in our party ordered fettuccine Alfredo and they were \"out,\" of course. When he told us he says, \"we're out get something else.\" We didn't get our food until 9:30. When we got it it was cold and soggy as if it had been sitting out for awhile and no one brought it out. Our martinis took 30 minutes to make. Oh, and of course we couldn't split the check which we were not told ahead of time. Waste of time and money. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"45 minutes in and our birthday party of 9 still does t have our drinks. She brought 4 out and the rest of us have been waiting. It took our server Tory 20 minutes prior just to take the drink order. Then she comes to take our order for dinner before the drinks are even out!!! She doesn't even mention the wait! It isn't even that busy for a Saturday. This is insane! We're sitting here and they are ruining my sisters birthday dinner. I can only imagine the wait for the food and anything else we need for the rest of our dinner. So disappointing. I will be letting people know my experience and to warn them never to visit here. Sad."}
{"text":"I decided to grab lunch at Chocolate bar during restaurant week. I checked their special restaurant week menu online and arrived there on time after making reservations. 

Atmosphere - First impression of this place was great. We were quickly seated and server was pretty friendly. I ordered a cappuccino and my boyfriend got Aztec hot chocolate. That hot chocolate was amazing. It comes with a white chocolate stirrer. Out of this world, good - probably loaded with high calories too. 

Food - We ordered our food quickly and that's when i learned the catch. Online advertising said that we could get soup/salad or salad/sandwich and non alcoholic beverage for the deal price. The server informed that only certain sandwiches can be provided for half and half deal. (Disappointment #1 - I can live with this)

Then we were informed that we can not get any salad but rather it will be just a house salad if we get the combo (Disappointment #2 - I am pretty disappointed at this time!)

And at last, she informed that we cannot get any beverage (Only the fountain drinks!). This was such a deal breaker! I wish they had put in fountain drinks online and in the restaurant week menu. I was under the impression, non alcoholic coffee or hot chocolate was included! :( 

Quickly decided to just order the regular food, so my boyfriend ordered the Tuscan sandwich with fries and I got Bella with fries. Both were really good and their sweet potato fries were amazing. I would definitely give them high rating for food.

Service - Was slow. It was not even that crowded, i was starving after 30 mins. It was just a simple sandwich, it surely can't take 35-40 mins for it. (For comparison, it was similar to Panera bread and they can get it to me within 5-10 mins) 
I glanced at our server a few times and she told me \"one minute and it will be here\" and then i waited for another 10 with a grumbling tummy. And then finally that good food arrived. Food was great, service was slow but atmosphere was fun. I may return again, if i am in the area but will make a trip to go there."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Go somewhere else and get a martini. I've eaten here a handful of times and the food is consistently cold, burnt and gross. The servers all have attitudes. AND their magician they have on Friday nights STOLE 20.00 from me. When I called to complain the owner was supposed to call me back which he never did. RIP OFF. I will NEVER go back or recommend. There are many better places to go with good food and drinks and quality service that won't steal your money."}
{"text":"Ok...Its tough to review when you've never eaten at a place so I guess I'm reviewing the martini's.  Hell, even the water glasses are cool here.  I've been here four times and have tried about 8-10 different ones.  Just like Momocho; we go in groups and each order different drinks and have a sip of each others.  The drinks are simply great.  The coconut macaroon, chocolate banana creme pie and there is also a peanut butter one....they have been the best.  I'm not much of a foo foo martini guy but these are really tasty.  I will say the one thing I might change is getting rid of the bright lighting.  One of the really great things is you can get a $25 GC on restaurant.com and use it on drinks.  Maybe $25 worth of booze for $2 is why I've never bothered to eat here?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a flight of martinis which was so good!  I ordered a salted caramel martinis which was unbelievable.  The server was so much fun!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner before my Frankie Valli show for the first time. It was packed because there was a browns game and an Indians game in a couple of hours. There isn't much room to move around. I squeezed in to a spot at the bar at the end. You are very close to the high top tables behind you. The bartender was Shannon and she was wonderful! She greeted me quickly for how busy she was. She was so nice and I felt comfortable being there. She is an awesome bartender. While sitting there I watched her juggle the drinks she had to make, take care of her own guests and the servers drinks. I've been a bartender and currently a server so I know how weeded you can get fast. She did so well and was impressed with her ability to provide such great service considering the circumstances. I wish more people were patient but they aren't...we are humans with only two hands..
On to the food..yum!! I got the sweet potato fries that came with 3 dipping sauces. I was a big fan of the maple one that's the only one I used. The fries were awesome. The strawberry basalmic flatbread was divine. The flatbread was more of a cracker which I'm not a big fan of but the toppings were awesome. Fresh mozzarella cheese fresh sliced strawberries basalmic glaze and white chocolate curl shavings. Wow! So good. I saw other people's martinis that looked fantastic. I don't drink but next time I plan to try one of their \"no tininis\" which are martinis with no alcohol. The strawberry cheesecake flavor is calling my name...
This place has a great atmosphere. Perfect before or after a Cleveland sports game or play at playhouse square. There is a nice patio where you can do some good people watching . That's a show in its self haha. I plan to be back to try some other things and will definitely get those fries again"}
{"text":"During our visit to Cleveland this past weekend, my husband and I were finally able to go check out Chocolate Bar! I've been wanting to check it out ever since he told me about it when he used to live in Cleveland. We only wanted drinks and desserts and everything looked so appealing on the menu that we needed recommendations. Our sweet and helpful waitress (wish I got her name!) told us the popular items and we were both very happy with her suggestions. I had the Coconut Macaroons Martini which was so amazingly good. My husband ordered the Chocolate Salted Caramel Martini. He loved it, and I'm not a huge fan of salted caramel, but that martini was delicious as well. For our dessert, we ordered the Bananas Foster Crepes. If you love bananas, I definitely recommend you get this! The place was busy when we went but we got a table really quick. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"As you can see from my original review below.. I'm a bit of a fan already.. But after going to dinner last night.. I'm an Addict. 

We did wait for a very long time to be seated, served, and cashed out, but it was worth it for me. 

I had the Swedish Fish Martini again, Spinach and Artichoke dip that was kind of ok, then the Chocolate Bar Pasta which was surprisingly awesome.  I was a little worried about the White Chocolate and sauce. but it was great!  Sweet but not too bad... Then I ended the dinner with Dip your own Strawberries in a deliciously creamy chocolate. 

My pseudo-date didn't get a drink, shared the app... Decided on the Fettuccine Alfredo. words can't describe that sauce for me, it was amazing.  Followed with a Crème Brule that was delicious... 

If you're in a rush.. don't stop.. but if you have the time to savor the food and enjoy the evening then I'd say go.  The server I had was actually very nice and apologetic about the wait.. 

Side Note - If you sit at the tall tables near the bar you can see into the kitchen and understand why it's so slow.. there isn't much in the way of cooking surfaces available, very small kitchen."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my most frequented restaurants in downtown Cleveland. I have been here for brunch, dinner and late night drinks. The food is just okay nothing extremely special about it. The brunch plates are very small and I have often left still hungry. The dinner menu is your typical American food- sandwiches, salads and some larger plate options. What keeps me coming back is their drinks especially their martinis! I have almost tried every one on the menu and it's always hard to choose what I want. My recommendations are the smores, chocolate covered pretzel and chocolate salted caramel if you want something with chocolate. If not, the peach is my hands down other favorite. I've been told to avoid the wedding cake and key lime pie martinis. I often use this is a spot to bring friends visiting from out of town and they love it. I can keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Pricey, drinks werent spectacular or anything. It's just Kalua, Baileys, Coffee, Dark Chocolate Syrup in a drink."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to go out to a nice restaurant, especially with friends or family.
They're a little pricy, but a lot of the dishes are unique enough that it's worth it. Particularly the flatbreads are delicious, and less expensive.
I would also particularly recommend the Raspberry Chocolate cocktail. Yum yum!

As far as being crowded, these guys are usually pretty full on weekends, but every time I go with a party of 4-6, we go around 8pm, and we always get a table right away. Maybe we're just lucky, but they also have an appropriate amount of space to accommodate the numbers they usually get.

The atmosphere is fun, but classy. They usually have some chocolate related movie playing on numerous TVs mounted in the corners. During the week, I've seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (the new one). On weekends it's usually a clip from I Love Lucy. 

To say the least, they're quite unique, and well worth trying out if you like chocolate :)"}
{"text":"If you are into a chocolate martini... This is the place to go. I have been here a few times on many different occasions. The chocolate martini comes in a ton of different flavors and each one I have had had been delicious. They are pretty expensive though. Not sure why a martini costs $10... But it is the experience! The food is ok. Nothing spectacular. They have a pretty big menu that pairs pretty well with the martini. 

If you go on a weekend night expect for it to be crowded and expect that the service will not be great. It is a very Cleveland place that is fun once in a while... Just not all the time."}
{"text":"If you like chocolate, come here! We only had deserts and drinks, but they were delicious. Quick service despite it being a crowded Saturday night. The decor & atmosphere isn't as good as other places in Cleveland, but it's worth stopping in for desert & desert themed martinis."}
{"text":"Why only 3 stars, Yelp! Why?  As much as I am usually aligned with other, this place was a 5-star experience for me.  
I came in to try their crepes, but when I saw salted caramel hot chocolate on the menu - I knew I had to try it.  The service was very friendly and welcoming, and the chocolate came out right away and just right after a stroll on the cold streets of Cleveland.  
The food at the table next to me looked great as well, I almost wished I skipped Lola for this... 
Next time in Cleveland, I guess..?"}
{"text":"The service was so bad we walked out. 

We were greeted with a frown after entering from the Arcade side, generally ignored, and left the way we came in. It was truly dreadful. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know what it says about a pricey & classy restaurant when their entree \"chocolate bar pasta\" doesn't even turn out to be that delicious.

I came here for a bachelorette party, which I must say is a great place to host one. The service was great, the staff was enthusiastic, there were plenty of cocktails to pick from. But the problem is the combination of quality and price. 

Cocktails (3.5): Each cocktail is about $10... and i felt like they all tasted pretty similar. I got the Smores cocktail and it was good in the sense that i couldn't taste the alcohol and it was chocolatey. 

Entree (1): The real issue was their entrees-- it's very very pricey for the portion (i got like less than a palm of pasta) and you are charged for almost every additional topping. I highly recommend not coming to eat here. For example, my friend ordered the mac n cheese. It was literally JUST mac n cheese. It was seriously like it came straight out of an easy mac box. Except, it was about $12. There was no meat or green onions to color it up. But wait, if you want carmelized onion with it or if you want some meat, you got to pay. Then, I ordered the Chocolate Bar Pasta, thinking I can't go wrong with it. I also paid an extra $3 to get some meat to go with it (shrimp). My dish came.. it was JUST pasta and shrimp. There were no herbs, no vegetables, no colors on my dish. There weren't even the colors of ground pepper! It was just white chocolate sauce (which looked and tasted like an extremely sweet alfredo sauce) with the shrimp I paid for. And my pasta.. I probably forked it up in about 3 servings and was done with it. 

Overall, this is a good place to grab a few chocolatey drinks with your friend, but that's probably about it. Sorry, Chocolate Bar, I was awfully disappointed."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate at this place on a little getaway for our anniversary. We made reservations and was seated quickly upon arrival. Our waiter was friendly and did well coming back to check on us. Food came out in appropriate time . I was down between ordering a steak with Jack Daniel sauce, came with another side, or steak and parmesan shrimp  that came with potatoes. I went with the Jack Daniels  , but wanted to switch to the potatoes. I ended up getting the steak and shrimp though, but for once in my life was I glad a waiter screwed up lol Best shrimp I ever had by far and the steak was delicious as well. Potatoes were very good as well.My wife and I got a Chocolate Martini, very good and then tried a chocolate and peanut butter martini and this was the best martini I had ever had in my life. I loved this place, only wish it was much closer to home."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the chocolate bar today for the first time. We sat at the very end of the bar (service bar) where the servers pick up their drinks, and waited for at least 5 to 8 minutes before we were acknowledged by one of the two bartenders.  The bar is not very long, and probably only seats about a dozen people. The place wasn't very busy, yet neither of the bartenders even gave us the courtesy of a \"hello\" or \"Hi! I'll be right with you in just a moment.\"  It was like we were invisible as they walked past us repeatedly, eyes down.  Throughout our stay I had a beer, a salad and a sandwich. My boyfriend had two martinis. Throughout the ordering process, I initiated every interaction.  I ordered the salad with no cheese or bacon. The salad took so ridiculously long to come out, I actually bet my boyfriend $5 that it was probably going to come out wrong, based on the low quality of service.  I actually lost the bet, and my $5, but the food exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely eat there again, but maybe not at the bar.  There were lots of servers standing around with no tables who would have been happy to wait on us, I'm sure.  I would fire my bartenders if they ignored patrons the way we were ignored today."}
{"text":"Great service; my glasses were never empty. The food, meh."}
{"text":"Went to Chocolate Bar on a girls night out with two of my girlfriends. We were initially enthused by the menu which has a lot of intriguing sounding dishes. There was much waffling about what to order while we had our first round of drinks. One of my girlfriends had the Wedding Cake Martini, the other the Creme Brulee Martini, and I had the spicy cherry spiked hot chocolate. The drinks were exactly what we expected. Sickeningly sweet ooey gooey delicious confections, a perfect girly girls night indulgence.

Those drinks turned out to be the only part of the meal that was worth paying for. Two of us ordered cup of the chocolate peppercorn soup, expecting a savory soup with hints of chocolate, something like a mole flavor or whatever. Soup. What we got was a cup full of melted chocolate and nothing else, not even any peppercorn flavor to be discerned. It was exactly identical to the \"chocolate ganache sauce\" that was served with our order of sweet potato fries. We'd ordered it as a side to our wraps (I had the roasted vegetable, my friend the turkey). Who wants to eat a bowl of hot fudge with a vegetable wrap? The wraps were lackluster at best. Plain flour tortilla with mushy flavorless fillings. Our other friend got the crab cakes which she described as extremely medicore. The coleslaw that came on the side looked absoutely abhorrent, she described it as relatively tasteless. The sweet potato fries were exceedingly average.

We decided that our next drink would be a shooter of espresso flavored vodka served in a chocolate cup,a  flight of three of them, that sounded like fun. We were served a tiny chocolae thimblefull of alcohol, no bigger than a mini ressecup. $10 and if you had put all three shots together it wouldn't have come close to making a cocktail.

By this point we were all pretty disappointed, but we ill advisedly decided to have one more drink and to try a mojito. My friends were already sick of chocolate so one of them ordered the raspberry, one the pineapple, I ordered the chocolate because it sounded interesting.

First we were told that they had run out of mint, but then a few minutes later we were informed that they'd found some.

The raspberry was overwhelmingly sweet and extremely artificial, the pineapple didn't have even a hint of pineapple, and mine, the chocolate mojito was absolutely undrinkable.

The waitress noticed us giggling and eyeing our drinks disdainfully and asked us how we liked them. We answered tactfully but honestly that we really didn't like them at all. Her suggestion was to add more soda water. As my friend put it, eyeing my drink \"I don't think more soda water can do anything for that one.\"

Overall it was an overpriced meal, nothing special at all, thoroughly disappointing. Not worth the expense or the calories."}
{"text":"Walking into this place, we were greeted with jokes and conversation, making it to be what seemed would be a good experience. However, the only thing this place has going for it is the ambiance/decor and their deserts. I ordered a sandwich which was mediocre. The service was subpar. The waiter was obviously new because he was following another employee. The waiter kept coming to our table when we weren't ready and then towards the end, he wouldn't come by our table at all."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dessert after seeing Wicked. Had the best creme brûlée I've ever had in my entire life.  It was a Sunday so we got there just at last call after our show, but they didn't care at all that we ordered dessert. Really friendly bartender."}
{"text":"FABULOUS EXPERIENCE! The soup, salad, main course, drinks and dessert were very flavorful and enjoyable. We had a wonderful server and really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. Excellent date night spot!"}
{"text":"If I was just reviewing the dark hot chocolate I would have given this place five stars.  It was amazing.  Creamy, rich and beyond good.  It was probably the best hot chocolate I have ever had.  It had thick whipped cream and a delicious chocolatey froth on top.  I wish I had some right now. 
However, everything else kinda canceled it out.  I had the southwestern spicy chicken salad with the light and spicy vinaigrette.  From the menu description it sounded rich and well spicy.  The chicken was well cooked but the whole dish was boring and basically had no taste.  The spicy vinaigrette tasted like olive oil.  There were no roasted poblano peppers on it and the corn tasted like it had just been thawed from a bag.  There was nothing that wrong with it but I could have easily made it at home and probably have it have more taste.  Just boring.  
For dessert my friend and I shared a \"classic sugar crepe\" with nutella.  I realize we may have gone the cheap route with ordering something so simple and may be not as expensive as the other options but the crepe was stone cold and very rubbery and hard to eat.  The nutella was great though and delicious with the half of strawberry that was used as a garnish.
Also, I really needed a knife but our server wasn't around enough to ask for for one.
The topping to the whole event though was being seated next to the mini store offering edible bras and underwear and different types of body frosting (I will admit I asked for the seat because it was not as cramped and a little more private but still if you have kids that might be a little uneasy for them and I had no idea that's what was being sold)"}
{"text":"Terribly slow service, for an empty dining room. The stay far away from the tomato/mozzarella panini (hardly any mozzarella on it!) And our waiter was impatient!!"}
{"text":"I would give the Chocolate bar three and a half stars if I could for their dessert. 

I read a lot of reviews before choosing to go here so let me say, I did not expect too much. For restaurant week, we did the $30 deal. Our appetizer was like a cheese sandwich with olives in it, that was okay...My white chocolate raspberry martini was good but for $10 it didn't blow me away. White Chocolate pasta was alright, kind of bland but good for something different. My two crab cakes were good. But the chocolate mousse was definitively the best thing we got. 

Overall, I might go back but not anytime soon. They had good desserts and good expensive drinks. The staff was really friendly and I thought it was a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Hyatt, this place ain't too bad for a night cap. Or even a \"pre-flight mid-day-cap-because-it's-snowing-and-the-spanish-coffee-looks-amazing\" cap. It's also a great place to catch a game since their flat screens are typically tuned in.

I didn't get a chance to try any of the food, but if you'd like to get out of your dimly lit room for a bit to chill or get some work done, this is a great option. You never even have to walk outside - you can just saunter on through the Arcade.

The staff are all all incredibly nice and always willing to walk through their menu with you to paint the most chocolately picture of what to expect from each offering.

I can't say that I would recommend Chocolate Bar as a must-see destination, but if you're in the area you should give them a go if you're in a mellow mood, with a sweet tooth calling."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Bar is a MUST when you're in Cleveland. Ok, whoever thought of creating a restaurant that specializes in chocolate desserts, martinis, and um delicious chocolate martinis is an absolute genius. They probably offer 20+ different martinis and also have a daily martini flight. They also had pages upon pages of dessert options plus a Sunday brunch. When I say NEVER do I ever go to the same place twice when visiting a new city, I absolutely mean NEVER EVER...... The Chocolate Bar was the only exception. I would go every day if I could!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and i wasn't impressed. Every drink I had was so sweet. They staff was so busy our table never got cleaned and the entire table was full of dishes and glasses. I do recommend the shareable appetizers. I would stay away from the steak, undercooked and cold in the center."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Arcade and starving. It also just so happened to be Labor Day. So, as you can imagine, starving on Labor Day didn't make for a good combo as most establishments were closed.  Luckily, the Chocolate Bar wasn't and it's attached to the hotel.

Since this wasn't a place I had previously looked up or gone out of my way for, my review is mostly based on the fact that I was simply looking to satisfy a need.  Got seated and attended to right away, so that was a plus.  The menu is interesting, there's many dishes that include some form of chocolate in them, but if you're not that adventurous, there are plenty of options that don't include chocolate.  I had actually wanted to get the past with the white chocolate alfredo sauce.  But, judging from my hunger, I was a little afraid that I would just be screwing myself if for any reason, I didn't end up liking it.

So instead, I decided to go for the Strawberry Balsamic Pizza with White Chocolate.  It was safe enough that I could probably guarantee that I wouldn't dislike it (double negative I know).  With that I ordered a frozen hot chocolate, because you can't have enough chocolate.

Instead of a frozen hot chocolate, they brought me just a regular hot chocolate.  I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and didn't want to hassle them to make it frozen (although admittedly I was mildly disappointed, but not end of the world).  It was pretty decent for a hot chocolate, although I don't think I'd pay $4 for it.

The pizza was pretty tasty so that was good.  Nothing extraordinary to report there, although I didn't really pick up on the white chocolate as much as I had hoped I would.  

In the end, it achieved what I needed it to achieve, which was 1. to be open and 2. have decent food.  In this case, mission accomplished."}
{"text":"I've visited the chocolate bar multiple times with different sized groups. It has typically been clean. The atmosphere is fun and lively. It is in a cluster of active nightlife. 

The dessert drinks are wonderful so it's a great place to end the evening. They have awesome dessert martinis and spiked hot beverages and milkshakes as well. Because we typically end our evenings here, I haven't had much of the food, but what I have tried was acceptable and average for down town. There's a los a large dessert selection if you're in to that. 

The service is average, nothing noteworthy either way. 

The Chocolate Bar is defiantly worth a stop for those with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"When Chocolate Bar first went into this space, I was stoked. I spent most of my weekends downtown and this was the perfect place to grab a drink and a reasonably priced food. However, their downfall was always slow and poor table service.

I hadn't been here for dinner since those first few years of opening, so I thought I'd try it out. I was disappointed to find that the service was exactly the same - SLOWWWWW. We came here on a Monday night, the place was dead, and it took way too long to get a drink and an entree. On top of that, the server was not attentive and never came back to our table with the empty martini glasses to ask if we wanted another. We were fully prepared to get another, but by the time he asked, we were already asking for the check.

While the service is unfortunate, the food is okay. For the price you are paying, it's a pretty good deal. And the only redeeming element of this place is their extensive drink and dessert menu. I'm pretty sure there were over 25 types of martinis and over 10 types of spiked hot chocolate. And the martinis were pretty scrumptious. I didn't get dessert on this occasion, but I've got it enough times from here to know that I have never been disappointed by their sweet treats. If I were to ever come back here, it would only be for drinks/dessert."}
{"text":"Had drinks after dinner on 4/9/2917.  Drinks are so good.  Fantastic.  Service was a tiny bit slow seemed like it took a while for the bartender to make the martini's which was odd.  I have a Martini bar back home and they take literally 60 seconds to make a martini.  We waited about 15 minutes for 6 martini's.  And the place was pretty slow. Anyhow they were definitely worth the wait.  Love this place.  I will come back when I visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to the Chocolate bar.

Why? Duh, chocolate. 

The Martinis are pretty spectacular, like you can't go wrong with a chocolate martini or a few shots made out of a chocolate shot glass, right? 
The drinks are put of this world.
But, that's about it. The food is quite bad. I've been here on multiple occasions. Bridal parties, before concerts and just because we wanted a chocolate martini. 
Every time, we're blown away by your drinks. However, your food? It's terrible! I very rarely use that word when it comes to food.
Unsure if you should make some changes on the menu, or get some staff that cares.
But, awful food!
Our service is always great, the place is always clean and packed. 
The food really needs a make over."}
{"text":"I gave them one star because they closed early and refused to serve us.  Last Sunday night my wife and I wanted to go out for dessert.  Using Yelp we found out that the Chocolate Bar was open until 10PM, so we drove there.  Upon entering at 9:32PM, we were informed by the hostess that the kitchen decided to close early.  There were lots of guests in the place, so they could not use the excuse that they had no business.

It is poor business practice to ignore hours of operations just for convenience sake.  We will not go back there."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the Chocolate Bar and most definitely my last!!! This was the strangest and worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. My husband and I were coming here for a relaxing evening before seeing a concert at the house of blues. This experience was the opposite of relaxing. First they seat us right by the door which it is winter now and every time someone opens the door we are blasted with freezing cold air. The seats are totally cramped on top of each other. Then the weirdest part of all our waiter. We ordered drinks because we wanted to try the chocolate martinis since it is the chocolate bar. The waiter warns us that they fill the drinks too much so he brings us a bunch of napkins. When he finally does bring the drinks which took quite a while he has some sort of shaking problem and he shook the drink all over my arm all over the floor and all over the table. Literally half my drink spilled out and it was a sticky mess. I could not believe it. I tried to find someone to help us. Finally a man came over who could really care less about what I had to say. He tells us the man who is our waiter was off two weeks for some medical issue. Well that's great now that my drink is spilled all over my arm. I just tried to tell him that maybe they should have someone else serving the drinks because he spilled a drink all over the people next to us as well. Totally strange and unacceptable. He did bring me another drink and it literally had no alcohol in it and it did not taste very good. They did not replace my husbands drink. So he tried to drink the sticky mess. He took a few sips said forget it tasted just horrible. We had the sweet potato fries for appetizer ,not good! I had what they called a fillet for dinner. I can tell you right now it was no fillet! My husband had a steak with shrimp. The food there has absolutely no taste and it is the poorest  quality food. I am telling you we should've just eaten at the Taco Bell Cantina down the street. The food there would have better quality!!! My warning to you is stay away from this horrible establishment where nobody cares about you and the food quality is horrendous!"}
{"text":"The food: Really good, I am never disappointed. They have great entree's and apps, it's not all just dessert. My fiancé and I love the toasted ravioli and chocolate bar baguette for apps. The desserts are fabulous.

The service: I have been here quite a few times, and I do have to say that the wait staff is quite slow. One time I went, I actually walked out because I sat and waited for 20 minutes without service. However, I did contact the manager and they graciously apologized and gave me a gift card for my next visit.

I will continue to come here, however it is not a good choice if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Went here after dinner with some friends for dessert and drinks.  The menu was really expansive, and my girlfriend had a hard time picking out the sundae she wanted.  Don't worry, guys, she figured it out.  She was wrong, though, as it wasn't the one I wanted to share.  Service was great, though.  Definitely a good find, especially considering it's right downstairs from where most of our party was staying!"}
{"text":"Really overpriced for the overall quality of the food and drinks. We ordered two appetizers and three cocktails and the bill was $50. Drinks took 15 minutes to get to our table - it was a Sunday afternoon and not that busy, so really no reason for it to take that long. The food was bordering on average - tasteless tomato and dry \"fresh\" mozzarella, spinach and artichoke dip made from a packet. Drinks could have been stronger for what we paid for them. Waiter was inattentive and kind of rude."}
{"text":"I really wish they would open up a restaurant like this around here because the week that I spent there for work, I went there everyday because it was fairly cheap and also it was part of the hotel I was staying at.

The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the service wasn't bad at all. They have tvs in there playing both the new and old chocolate factory movies (which I love!). One of the days we went it was absolutely packed, and it was also my birthday! So we wanted to have a few people to sit with us for dinner and the manager did his best to accommodate us. He put us up in a private room! It was great and all the food and drinks came out at a decent time.

My favorite dish there was their own specialty called the white chocolate pasta. Now, when I first saw it, I wasn't exactly sure about it but I decided to go for it. I'm extremely glad that I did try it because as weird as it may seem, it actually was quite delicious! 

I also had their chocolate martini and that was also quite good. I think overall I was very pleased with this restaurant. It was also nice because we normally got done with work quite late and this was one of the only restaurants close by that was open late."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick lunch and didn't realize they have such a good food selection! Briana was very helpful and recommended the Rueben- yummy!  Also had the chicken hummus wrap and that was good.  Quick service and will definitely go back for food and to try their desserts-five pages of desserts!"}
{"text":"Food is subpar. Service is slow after you get your food. Anything chocolate is good though. They only offer styrofoam containers for your leftovers. Highly environmentally irresponsible. This stuff isn't recyclable in Cleveland. Nor is it recyclable in Columbus, Dayton, Akron, Toledo or Cincinnati. It's banned in NYC, DC, LA, Seattle and others. Stop using styrofoam!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during happy hour (which we found out later).  Nothing we ordered was happy hour priced because nobody told us it was happy hour......how rude!

We sampled three martinins - chocolate raspberry truffle, creme brulee, and chocolate peanut butter cup.  They were all good.  They were all very sweet and desserty.  The chocolate raspberry was the favorite.  

We washed it all down with a triple chocolate mousse, Surprisingly light while, obviously, still decadent."}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed after my experience there. I went there with my friend for a nice respite after a loong day for some soothing drinks. I'm not sure if this is the new way to make martinis (with ice in them), but it definitely was not strong enough for me. Flavor was perfect, substance... not so much. I got the chocolate chocolate mint martini and my friend had the raspberry something martini. Neither of us felt this martini hit it. 
At least the server was nice, though it did take a while for her to be reminded to come serve at our table."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice however the food isn't. The French onion soup taste like water and so does the hot chocolate. I had high hopes for this place, but it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here before a Cavs game. The service was prompt and friendly.  The Cuban sandwich and desserts were fabulous.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Came here on our first day in Cleveland. Located right next to the Arcade. Easily visible from the street. The name alone is what intrigued us to eat here, \"Chocolate Bar.\" 

Obviously as the name suggests they have alcohol with chocolate in their drinks!!! And the food has chocolate in their dishes as well.

I ordered the white chocolate pasta and a chocolate caramel martini. The pasta was yummy. It came with a white Alfredo sauce, creamy yet sweet. Also came with a side of potatoes. 

The martini was exactly what you'd expect. Very sweet and even sweeter with the caramel. It also came with an edible chocolate straw. 

Could have better presentation and honestly my expectations for the quality of the food were much higher than what I received. Kind of like I-hop or Denny's quality for the food. Nothing super fancy, basic  and average on the tasting scale. Very gimmicky, the food is decent."}
{"text":"I am rating Chocolate Bar only on dessert.   I got the carrot cake, which was shameful.  It tasted old and refrigerated, and was insanely overpriced (even though I would not have paid $1 for it.)  While there may be other qualities to this establishment than desserts, it seems that the name implies good dessert.  Which I didn't experience."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, burguers and chocolate shakes. Specially good and recommended are their sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"O.M.G.  A bar devoted to chocolate, count me in.  Their martinis are phenomenal.  Who says you can't have dessert before dinner?"}
{"text":"Rather mediocre cuisine. We found the menu to be kind of carbie and fatty.  I had an asian tuna wrap that was dripping with mayo, lacked asian flavors and the tuna was overcooked. Overall, meh. If you are looking for a piece of chocolate cake or a chocolate martini you are probably in the right place. Service is very good. No recommendation."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you hear so much about and your wife nags you to take her so much that you finally do. Limited menu. 
The appetizers were much better then the main dishes. If your gonna go here, stick to appetizers and  desert. 
But you want a good fulfilling meal then go across the street to one of those many restaurants over there in that alley."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here with my family before the Cavs game. What a let down :( I made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance. It would have been great to know they offer valet parking! We could have walked to the game from here. 
The menu is more focused on drinks and desserts than dinner. My kids ordered a grilled cheese, that only comes with chips, and mac and cheese, that only comes with chips. Well, my one year old cannot have chips yet. A different option of a fruit or veggie would be great in this case! My son who doesn't eat a lot would not even put a second bite of mac and cheese or grilled cheese in his mouth. He said the cheese tasted funny. My daughter who eats everything, I mean everything (like even brussel sprouts), would not even eat the grilled cheese. I got her to eat a few bites of the mac and cheese, but that was a struggle. I am not sure what kind of cheese they use, but I tasted both kids meal items and the cheese was fairly strong. Definitely not kid friendly. 
I ordered the asian tuna wrap, again with chips, and my husband had the Cuban with chips. Neither of us cared for our meals. The tuna wrap was dry, barely any of the spicy sauce which would have made it more tasty. The fish seemed overcooked also. And the cuban was just a lot of bread and hardly any meat. 
Since not really any of us ate our dinners we proceeded to order dessert before heading to the game. The flourless chocolate cake was great! We probably should have ordered more than 1 piece for all of us to split. 
I would love to come back here and order a drink and dessert only. That would maybe change my mind of this place."}
{"text":"I feel the need to say that the mac n cheese wassss..bland. Bland AF. I even added a pound if salt and pepper. Still bland. Bland AF. The chocolate chocolate mint martini though, bomb."}
{"text":"Daughter and I went on a Friday night at 6:00, plenty of tables available. Our server was super chill, he had a Cavs championship ring on - he said he was a dancer with the Cavs so he got a ring which was pretty cool. We tried the Cocoa puffs alcohol milkshake which was tasty and filling. I got the crabcakes, they were decent, nothing special; daughter got the seasoned pork tenderloin, the taste was good but it was really overdone so it was very chewy. Pork should be cooked to medium. For dessert my daughter got the lava cake which was fine, nothing special. I ordered the chocolate mousse Brulé but I was given the triple infusion chocolate mousse. The server got a little confused with the order - I was fine, chocolate is chocolate. It was tasty and he was nice enough to take it off of the bill. It's a kind of a cool place to go for specialty drinks but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"My wife and just came in from out of town and are stay at the Hyatt which a joins the restaurants. We order the Filet Mignon with asparagus and Garlic potatoes which was great for $16.95.  Wasn't happy that we asked for a warm place to sit and got put right in front of the door which employees kept holding open. Also order a crepe that looked like some one threw up on. Very bad presentation of there food."}
{"text":"Really not very good. I have been there twice in recent past expecting good food and great chcolate anything. Definitely overpriced and less than mediocre. Do not waste your dollars or get your hopes up. The arcade is beautiful but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my second time at The Chocolate Bar and the experience was very similar to the first. The service is horrible. We arrived during a non-busy time, had to ask the hostess and the manager twice for service, before we actually were served (15 minutes later). Why didn't we leave? We had a livingsocial.com coupon and needed to use it before the due date. Anyhow, there were 3 waitresses waiting around but because we were not seated in their areas, they refused to bring us water or to even greet us. When our server, Tiffany came by, she was very apologetic. It turns out, the management and hostess failed to tell her she had new customers. I did appreciate Tiffany's service. She was great with making sure our food came out quickly and to check in with us periodically. 

I had the roasted chicken sandwich which was good. The flavors with the sundried tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on a ciabatta bread was refreshing and delicious. The sweet potato fries were forgettable. Of course, I had to try the chocolate martini. Do not get it! It's simply very little amount of vodka mixed with a chocolate syrup milk. For a signature drink, I was very disappointed at how much the drink tasted like non-fat chocolate milk. Gross.

I definitely will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Went here for late night dessert with the family. Everything was amazing. I would recommend any of the crepes or the creme brûlée. Place has a classy chill vibe to it."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all by this place. Their sundaes are nothing special- just generic ice cream, fudge, and brownies with a TON of whipped cream. I can make this at home, but they charge $9 for it here!"}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about this place. Granted we stopped in for one drink and an appetizer but what I had there was really phenomenal. I tried the chocolate covered strawberry martini and my husband had the salted Carmel martini. Both were to die for but probably couldn't have more than 2 before you die of chocolate overload. 

We tried the chicken and chorizo appetizer and to be honest I didn't expect much from the food at a martini place but it was really great. Cooked well and had great flavor and large enough for my husband and I to split. 

I would absolutely come back and even have dinner here.  Little pricy but the food and drinks were done very well along with service."}
{"text":"Bought buffalo chicken sandwich and the breading was cold and hard and very little buffalo sauce and blue cheese . Seemed like it was under a warmer"}
{"text":"Overall: 3 stars.  We visited after the Indians game for a round of 4 drinks only..  If the chocolate drinks are bad, then there's not really a point in coming here.  

Drinks: 2 stars.  We didn't have any food, although they had a nice selection of food and it sounded good.  They had a long list of inventive drinks.  We tried the chocolate martini, chocolate mojito and chocolate beer (vodka & stout).  All the drinks had chocolate vodka, which was nasty with a bad aftertaste and ruined the drinks.  I'd recommend they find a better chocolate vodka or make their own mix.

Atmosphere: 4 stars.  It's a well-done interior with a nice patio in a great location.

Service: 3 stars.  The server was very helpful and attentive, until he dropped off the check.  I placed my credit card in the check and it took about 15-20 minutes for him to come back to pick it up."}
{"text":"Ok, I frequent the chocolate bar often and it is a bit of a tradition. However, I realize the place is not the same anymore. Yes, it was a slow night for the staff, but when customers brace the frigid temperatures, they should be made to feel welcome and that the money will be appreciated. So, greet the customers at the door and welcome them, even if it is a slow night. I must say the service at the bar was really good. Bring back the chocolate straws to all of the chocolate martinis! If you make changes to your menu, then update the menu so that customers will know what to expect. My food was cold, which was odd because the restaurant was extremely slow. Lastly, if you are working in the restauant at night, please do not bring your children to work and spend more time attending to them and not the customers."}
{"text":"I've never tried the martinis, so here's a review of their food.

You'd think a place called chocolate bar would try to incorporate chocolate into their entrees or something.  They have exactly one appetizer, one salad, and one entree that include chocolate in any form.  The appetizer was the only one we tried - it was a very underwhelming piece of baguette bread dipped in chocolate.  For entrees, we ordered the pecan chicken and pesto salmon - both of which were overcooked and dry.  For dessert, we ordered a banana split crepe.  They got our order wrong and gave us a banana split ice cream instead.  They also took forever to bring it out (really? it's ice cream), so we ended up settling for it.  It was.. nothing special.

This place was very unspectacular, to say the least.  I guess it's your typical boring bar food.  Maybe one day if I ever come back here, I'll try a martini or something."}
{"text":"K. Stopped in for a martini!  Place has really fell off, meaning pretzel Martini had stale pretzel crumbs, and I had  cherry lemon drop, served with a dried up lemon wedge.  For a cocktail bar that specializes in chocolate martinis, wow this was bad, my wife had to tell them to switch out the pretzels!"}
{"text":"I met a co-worker at the Chocolate Bar during my week stay in OH. Our waiter was pretty direct and didn't give anymore than we asked as far as service. I ordered a vodka cranberry, a white chocolate martini & a caramel apple crepe. My drinks were really good. I was not as satisfied with my caramel apple crepe. I'll definitely skip it next time."}
{"text":"You never need an excuse to dine on chocolate but this place is amazing! I love the table-side s'mores! Most of the menu is delicious but the service is slow. I guess good things come to those who wait!"}
{"text":"Yummmo!  Had a peanut butter and chocolate martini. Even though the place was packed we managed to score two seats at the bar.  The staff was helpful and attentive. Will return at some time to try dinner and the awesome looking deserts."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place looses points for bad service from the waiter, this guy was not professional. The food options are scarce in their brunch menu but the food was decent. We had panini's which are not really panini's. The chocolate martini was good but it had been filled up a lot and this causes the waiter to spill some of it on the table and splattered onto my white shirt, and he didn't even apologize. It's a big place but it was practically empty, now I know why."}
{"text":"How does a restaurant that has two pages of desserts run out of whipped cream?  I believe there is a grocery store a couple blocks away.  Reddi Whip is better than no whip."}
{"text":"Came here for a midnight fix. I wanted dessert and they opened late. Eh."}
{"text":"Hitting Cleveland for a one night stay for business, I ventured towards the E 4th St area for some eats and to see what was out there. I came up on Chocolate Bar and upon both seeing it in Yelp and looking inside, I decided I'd grab a bite here. Nicely decorated restaurant and bar, I can see that it would be a good place to grab a drink or hang out with some friends. But I was pretty hungry and needed food.

I was greeted cheerfully as I came in and shown to the nearest table with a menu to look over. But I waited...and waited.... Finally the server from the next table that was talking to patrons seated after me looked over and said \"Has she come to you yet?\" I just answered \"No\" not knowing which \"she\" is responsible for my table. That server from the next table came back and got my drink handled (just water) and took my order. Maybe it took a bit longer than I had anticipated or I was just that hungry but I felt the process was just longer than I had figured on investing. I had ordered the Reuben and it was OK, nothing wrong with it at all but not a standout. It fit the bill and got my hunger taken care of. I opted not to get dessert or anything to drink and decided to settle the bill and head on out to the E 4th St area for a bit.

Bottom line: Good Reuben sandwich. Seemed I was dropped off to my table with no pickup from my server to continue my night, a bit frustrating. Given the food was OK when it came, I can go with A-OK three stars."}
{"text":"As another reviewer stated, I wanted to love it but it didn't live up to my expectations. I came on the recommendation of a local, who said it was just amazing. We only got drinks, so I cannot speak to the food. It was maybe around 10, so we saw many desserts go out. They looked great, nothing overly amazing, but good.
I ordered a martini, as I was suggested by the person I spoke with. The martini list is extensive, but there are no descriptions. I guess you could ask the server what each has in it, but basically you're on your own for a shot in the dark. At $9.95 per drink, you expect the martinis to basically be all alcohol, but without descriptions, it's hard to know what you're getting. For me, this made the decision on what to order unnecessarily difficult.
I got a \"wedding cake\" martini. Not sure what kind of wedding cake they wanted it to taste like, but it tasted like strawberry shortcake. Maybe I got the wrong one. It was good, but I expected something like vanilla buttercream. So perhaps it is my fault and I should have asked what was in it, but it was not what i thought it would be. That said, it was good and I drank it. My bf got a bottle of beer, which at $4.50 seemed a bit steep to me. They sell long-stemmed roses which is a cute surprise- my bf bought one for me while I made the long trek to the bathroom (seriously- to the back of the restaurant and down a flight of stairs!)
Service was mediocre. Our server said almost nothing to us. At a specialized place like that, i expected a bit more explanation. There wasn't even an inquiry of whether we had ever been or not, basically just \"what do you want\". Oh well. He was clearly busy, but it was to the point where he did not enhance my experience in the slightest.
Overall, Chocolate Bar is clearly an attraction. If you want to go out with the girls for fancy martinis, go for it. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop there."}
{"text":"Really terrible experience here. Ordered the salted Carmel martini based off the server's recommendation, and it was horrible. I tried to drink it but could not, so after two sips I politely told the server that I didn't prefer it. She grilled me about what was wrong with their \"most popular drink\". I thought everything was wrong with it, so I didn't know how to begin. She said that she could only fix it and wouldn't take it off the bill, even though the drink was completely full. The manager came over and rudely greeted us by interrogating me about what's wrong with the drink and stated that \"it is good, and we are wrong\"....... he still refused to take it off the bill and he walked away like an angry toddler, huffing and puffing. Really I've never been treated like this at a restaurant, let alone by a manager. Do not go here. This will be out of business soon if they maintain this behavior towards their costumers.

Go to greenhouse, or mables, or ANYWHERE else. It's the same price, and WAY better food and service"}
{"text":"I liked this place. However, I ordered a drink it was extremely sweet. Asked to receive a different drink and they stated they can't take it off my bill but can remake the drink and make it less sweet. I'm confused. What type of establishment are they running. Your customer doesn't like it, fix the issue and move on. You want them to have a good experience and return. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place :) it was my first time here and the atmosphere was ambient. I got the Berry Good Salad and a flourless chocolate cake, my friend got the pecan chicken and a raspberry hot chocolate. I will come again with my other friends hopefully in December! A nice and not too expensive place to get something to eat or drink, perfect!"}
{"text":"I got lunch Togo and it came out pretty fast :) 

I got the Cajun chicken shrimp - I know it's supposed to be blackened but this was almost burnt. It was still tasty just a little greasy and salty for my taste. The sweets look delicious I'll be grabbing some later tonight. I'd try something else off the menu but wouldn't order this entree again."}
{"text":"A little gimmicky but really, come on, who does love chocolate everything? Lunch service can be slow though which is tough when you're ducking out from work. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in for dinner on a Saturday evening. The hostess asked us did we know if we would be done eating before they closed which wasn't for 2 more hours. I felt that was rude. However our waitress was lovely. I ordered sirloin (medium rare)and shrimp which was delicious. However we were seated in a semi private dining area in the back away from everyone else which was really cold and uncomfortable. Other than that I had a nice experience at the Chocolate Bar."}
{"text":"My wife says the martini's are good, but good god the service here is terrible. We were her 12/26 during happy hour when there was about 3 tables of people sat. The manager told us that there would be at least a half an hour wait for a table even though there are 30+ tables that were open. We decided to sit at the bar, the bartender seemed to not want to be bothered with us and it took 15 minutes to get his attention off of his phone and onto us. I was ready to leave but she wanted to stay for the martini's. I had a Pepsi which they charge for by the glass and order their signature chocolate pasta which came with a side of cold canned corn and diced tomato's for some reason. I've been here a few times and the same thing keeps happening, the premise of this place is great but the staff does not want to be bothered with actually doing their job. I'll probably forget and go back there again sometime but you guys probably shouldn't.


**Edit** I totally forgot about the bathroom situation, they are outside of the resteraunt in a basement of the arcade next door. You have to leave out a back door, then take an elevator back upstairs and re-enter through the front door to return to your table, good luck not getting lost!"}
{"text":"The Chocolate Bar is a very unique place. It sounds more like a cocktail bar, which it partially is, but it is also a thriving restaurant. 

I was here on a Saturday and the only table available to those who did not have a reservation was one left on the patio. Busy busy busy. I guess people must really like this place. The inside is dark  with most of the lighting coming from the natural light. The patio area is nice right off of Euclid so you can people watch. 

Almost everything on the menu has something to do with chocolate. Even the pasta dishes. It is really quite strange to me. Drinks and desserts, ok that is cool, pastas and pizza, now that is weird. But again, people like it and they say it tastes good. The cocktails were proven to be good by a few people in my party but again I did not participate. I got a flatbread that did not have chocolate in it. Whew! There are very few items on the menu that don't include chocolate.

Have I referenced chocolate in this review?

Not my kind of place but like I stated earlier the people must love it here because it stayed busy all Saturday evening. 

FYI (The washroom is in the back and down the stairs, in what feels like an old underground mall area)"}
{"text":"The decor is nice, however the seating near the waiting area gets a blast of cold each time someone walks in.  I didn't wait long to be seated, and the hostess had a beaming smile, I was already excited to be there.

This place I would say is good choice for a date, or for casual dinner with friends.  The menu is super affordable considering the location.  I had their mac n cheese with bacon that was above par.  The portion was great as I was so full only halfway through my meal.  

My waitress was kind an efficient, with zero problems whatsoever.  I also had the pleasure of enjoying a peanut butter cup chocolate martini that was a glass full of heaven.  I love the humor on their staff's shirts, those are for sale to the public as well.  

I didn't get to try any dessert as I was so full from my dinner alone, but I can't wait to try the fondue for 2 next time I go.  Hopefully I can have someone to enjoy it with as I think the idea of fondue itself is so romantic!  

If you go for nothing else but the martini's and their expansive dessert menu, consider yourself still lucky.  There are only 2 of these locations in the USA right now!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't seat outside of reservation. How do you stay in business by doing that? Tonight is not our night."}
{"text":"This was near my hotel while in town from Chicago. I think this is one of the best places ever for an after dinner drink. It's like after dinner; you want a drink or dessert well you can have both in one! The peanut butter cup martini was amazing. The food isn't super special but the bartender was friendly and attentive and the dessert cocktails were really delicious."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch today...ordered fried ravioli an that was out in 5 minutes followed by my French onion soup that took about 5 minutes to make...currently waiting 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches and a flatbread...finally the waitress came by to take the fried ravioli plates away and let us know our food should be out shortly..when we ordered there was only about 4 tables with customers and now they have a full reaturaunt as the tribe game just let out...hope our food arrives today....
Update..food has finally arrived...unfortunately my flat bread which looked and tasted good arrived cold...lucky for them i was too hungry to send it back...the wrap my fiance got came out ok but was missing guacamole a key ingredient in the wrap...the fries she handed me after i finished the flatbread were still warmer the my meal.. food 3 stars...service 1...wont be rushing to come back...ever"}
{"text":"Orgasm in my mouth. What more is there to say about Chocolate Bar? I have been there for dinner once and drinks multiple times before sporting events. Prices are expensive but without one taste of a black forest martini you might forget about it (however, you probably shouldn't). 

The martini's are to die for and as their menu states everything IS better with chocolate. However, note that the price of one delicious, orgasmic martini is $9.95. Who ever thought there would be a price for love? Food quality equals the decadent martini list, I highly recommend the French Onion Soup. 

 Despite the expensive menu (which is why I try to limit outings when heading up to Cleveland) the service and atmosphere are awesome. If Willy Wonka wanted to open a bar I think that Chocolate Bar is a good example of what he might try to create."}
{"text":"Great thick milkshakes. My father got a chocolate milkshake and I got a chocolate peanut butter. Both delicious"}
{"text":"I have to say it was good but nothing I couldn't buy at a grocery store. It's great for a night out but not a regular place to hang out ."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We have been several times and I have never been disappointed...okay they could make the drinks faster! That aside I have to say everything I have tried here has been awesome! Go with a bunch of friends and everyone order something different! We started with Baked Brie,Artichoke Spinich Dip and the Steak Crostini. Yum and yum, all were very good! Martini's maybe pricey..but are made well and taste awesome! Time to order Entree's... We ordered the Mexican Pork Tenderloin, Crab Cakes, Mac N Cheese Bar loaded with all the goods and the Pecan Chicken. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted amazing! The Pecan Chicken so darn good! Mac and Cheese comfort yum! Time for dessert!!!  Okay were bad people to hang around...but we know what we like....so we got the Berries and Chocolate,Chocolate Fondue, Flight of three Cupcakes and the Sinnamon with three shots of Goldschlager and this after all of us downed four martini's each! Every dessert was made to perfection and needless to say my lush friend Mary picked up the Sinnamon and drank every last drop of Goldschlager! I have seen some bad reviews on here. I think that timing is everything! If your in a huge hurry to get to the theater to see a show than you may want to skip this place for now! If your going bowling after....like we did...waddling across the street then it is perfect....I think everyone should try it once!!! Enjoy... We have several times!"}
{"text":"Customer service is definitely lacking. The experience began at the host/hostess stand when we were barely welcomed in a cold way.  We were sat with no greeting or told to enjoy ourselves. The waitress was cold we had to ask for our check, then she took too long to process our payment by taking multiple orders on a non busy night. Evenings like this fall on one person the head/management. I hope they get it together because the concept of this place is good."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu sounded amazing. However the actual food was average. I would not get the flatbread as it was extremely thin and not as crisp as most flatbread is. There was hardly any pork on top. The sweet potato fries were decent and are served with what tasted like some sort of white chocolate dipping sauce. For dessert I got the Nutella stuffed crepe (mocha one?) and it was really good! It's served with a side of ice cream which I never had served with a crepe before. 

Our waiter was so soft spoken we could not hear anything he said. While he was attentive he was not very engaging which sort of detracted from a super positive experience. 

I would come back again to try more of the desserts and skip getting an entree."}
{"text":"went in tonight with our dinner club.......cute idea, but a strange one. server was friendly but a little  loose with her language. we counted her using the word \"sh*t\" 3 times, twice with us at the table and once to a co-worker on the floor. 
food was fair, more like a lunch spot than a dinner restaurant. lots of sandwiches, salads, a few entrees, wraps, etc. 
had a couple of appetizers.....the sweet potato fries were good, but not house cut and made, served with 3 sauces, one of which was chocolate - yuk!  my steak blt was good. the crepe dessert was nothing special, in fact, most of the desserts are more expensive than the food. 
food prices were cheap, in my eyes. staff was standing around talking to each other the whole time, while WILLY WONKA was played continuously, looped, on some tv screens scattered around.
nobody said good-bye or thanks on our way out, we had to \"cut\" through a group of staff to leave..........one odd note, a server sat a rack of clean glasses on the floor to stock a service cart.....just gross.....if this is what they do when we're looking, what's going on behind the scenes?
neat idea for a restaurant that just doesn't work for me.....too confused. is it a restaurant, dessert bar, lunch spot.....make up your mind."}
{"text":"Yummy food and even better drinks! Couldn't help but have two of these peanut butter chocolate martinis. They were also super great about working around my sisters shellfish allergy, which is much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Loved the smore martini and lady Godiva. This might be one of the best places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food here is only satisfactory. However, the dessert is sinful! I recommend the chocolate molten lava cake with a scoop of cappuccino ice cream. So fantastic! Also their chocolate martinis are the best in cleveland (especially the salted caramel one)!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had already eaten dinner and were looking for a nice spot to sit outside and get some drinks and found this place. The dessert menu is pretty large and was what I expected to find from a placed called Chocolate Bar (half the menu was food, the other half was dessert).

I ordered the Belgian Chocolate Mousse Cake. I expected a little more mousse, but it was still delicious, decadent, and sweet. I loved that the presentation and the little extra on the plate - I also got a mini eclair.

Their martini menu all sounded delicious and we tried the creme brulee martini. It had a nice flavor, very boozy, but delicious. However, I probably wouldn't get more than one being that they are ten dollars apiece. 

Overall, I say a good place to go and indulge - desserts and cocktail kind of a place; not to sure how the actual food is."}
{"text":"I've given this place several chances but I have never received good service here which is a shame because their martinis really are quite tasty.

The first time, I came for happy hour but unfortunately left unhappy due to the fact that, unbeknownst to me, I had ordered a martini that was NOT part of the happy hour specials. In fact it was at this point that I found out that there are really only like 2 martinis that are a part of the specials. Of course because the waitress did not explain this to us (and mind you, I specifically asked about their happy hour specials) I did not leave much of a tip. If you dare to check in here for a happy hour I would make sure to doublecheck on the prices of the drinks you are ordering. 

Another time we were here while they were quite busy and I would've been understanding for their slow service were it not that the workers were so extremely rude! After waiting for a good amount of time for a table I ran into a friend who I asked to join us but then was told that I was not allowed to pull up a chair for an extra person. Once we were finally seated I had to flag someone down after a good 10 min just to get a menu which the server was not happy about having to bring them to us ( he was clearly too busy appearing to be busy). 
Don't think I'll be returning to Chocolate Bar anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had high expectations walking in, given the witty name and how delicious their chocolate drinks sounded. Unfortunately, the Chocolate Bar does not live up to the hype. I ordered the non-alcoholic Chocolate Martini, which at ~$6 was disappointing. The drink was decent, but the taste/quality of the chocolate did not justify the price tag. The food was more reasonably priced but no less mediocre. I ordered the Filet Mignon ($16.95), which came out looking like something I could cook at home on a weeknight. The filet was tender but not particularly flavorful--overall pretty average. I was satisfied, but this wasn't a meal that I'll remember.

2.5 stars, rounded up, given our very friendly and helpful waitress. 

Just a note: unfortunately, there's no parking lot, so we had to valet."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night around 10p: the place was packed, no seats at the bar. The crowd was a bit older, professional, 20s, 30s, matching the east4th atmosphere. Stopped back at 1ish, my friends [and me too] really wanted to try a martini here.

Swedish Fish martini !? Yes ! $10, it was exquisite. Sugar-rimmed glass [some fancy sugar too]; replicated the excellent Swedish fish taste without a gratuitous sugar taste in the drink. Worth 5 stars. 

Service was ok. 

However, my friends and I split the smores platter. It's a platter of 2 Hershey bars [really, Hershey; I expected something more fancy to match the decor, atmosphere, and the $12 price.] a few graham crackers, marshmallows, and a few whole strawberries [enough for 4-5 smore sandwiches] with a propane-fired trivet. I'd rather have my smores for $12 less in my backyard."}
{"text":"I went for a birthday dinner Tuesday evening and the overall experience was meh, take it or leave it. I'm just really thankful it wasn't for my birthday dinner though. I've heard lots of great things about the various adult beverages and that they are phenomenal! I must say if I were rating this place on drinks alone it would be a 5 star location -Bailey's Mocha? Yes please! 

 However the reason for the knocking down of stars... the food and service weren't worth the time we spent here. Our table ordered appetizers to split, buffalo chicken nachos and spinach artichoke dip. The chicken was okay, but on the colder side of the obviously microwaved end of the spectrum with chips that could have been crispier. The spinach artichoke dip was on the bland side and could have used more something. The pita served with it was pretty decent though. I nibbled on that instead of the dip. As for entrees:  the males in my group both had two different sandwiches, the Rueben and Cuban -both said meh. The birthday gal and I both tried steaks, slightly overcooked, but nothing to whine about after waiting 30 minutes on a SLOW Tuesday night. We each had asparagus and potatoes as our sides and we inhaled those. 

Hopefully my next experience this week will prove to be better... What's with girls and this place!?"}
{"text":"I never knew such heavenly place existed for a chocoholic like me.  It's a little nice fancy restaurant located on a street where there were plenty of other good restaurants as well. I dined here on a Sunday for lunch and ordered the breakfast flatbread. Service was excellent. I was a bit disappointed that their lunch menu didn't have a lot of variety and when I asked if they could do a dinner menu,  they were adamant on it could be only made for dinner. So whatever I moved on. Flatbread was actually good.  Than for dessert Oh boy! I had such a hard time picking one because their chocolate menu literally consisted about 3 pages of different chocolate drinks and a couple different pages for chocolate desserts!  So innovative!  I wanted to try something that was unique so I ordered Banana crepe with Baileys kahlua liquor and Ice cream. OMG it was amazing. I was so happy I almost cried, chocolate heaven at last!  I wish this existed in Florida.  Overall, it was awesome.  I didn't get to try their chocolate martinis which they were known for,  but when I will be in Ohio again,  I for sure will be back to try the rest of their menu!!! Highly recommended for date night,  group or even Solo dining!"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to the chocolate bar while visiting family in Cleveland. I had a chocolate covered strawberry martini and it was absolutely delicious, along with a turkey wrap which was okay. Overall, it was a tad expensive. My tip is also to only order one martini too. I am a huge chocolate lover but they are SO rich that by the time you drink your martini and eat less than healthy food, it leaves a slightly unpleasant feeling.

I think this place would be great for a drink and an appetizer or just dessert but it's very rich for a full meal."}
{"text":"We had gone by the Arcade to take some pictures and stopped by for dessert (before dinner). I had the raspberry ruffle truffle tart, and others had the brownie explosion sundae and a chocolate mousse tower. My ruffle truffle was okkkaaay - it was good to have the raspberry/chocolate combo, but the texture wasn't as fluffy as I would have liked. The mousse was light, rich, and chocolatey and I liked that a lot better. I would say, peruse the refrigerator case and whatever looks expensive, you should get. I did that, thought the ruffle truffle looked poorly made, but still got it. Not a good decision.

So meh, this is alright. It reminds me of a cheese cake factory, which I kinda think is overrated, though they do do their cheesecake very well."}
{"text":"Really cool place for dessert and drinks. The chocolate is great and so are the drinks. I can't speak for the food since I haven't had but I will go back to try it. Slightly pricey but worth a trip."}
{"text":"Today's experience was great! We got here just as it opened for Sunday Brunch. The menu had a little something for everyone. The staff was friendly and we had no hiccups during the visit. We thought the cost for the location and the food quality was right-on. 

However, I didn't give this five stars because the two previous visits didn't leave us wanting to come back. 

The first visit was on a busy Sunday morning, and there were lots of open tables but unless we had a reservation, they were not seating us. 

The second visit we got on their wait list, gave the gal our number to text when a table was ready and then we walked the road a bit. After 20 minutes we decided to eat somewhere else, and we never did get that text that our table was ready. In addition to that, at the hostess stand, one server in particular was rudely telling us to move out of the entrance so she could get by. And she did that same thing to other guests who were walking in. Maybe it's just me, but if your tables are through the entrance area of a busy breakfast restaurant, maybe a kind \"excuse me please\" or the host asking guests to step aside would be more welcoming.

We only ended up here today. Excuse the Greenhouse Tavern didn't open until 11am this place is 10am on Sunday."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of 8.  The place wasn't too busy, so we got seated and served very promptly.

Waiter was awesome and the food was great.  Also ordered a few shakes that were definitely worth the splurge.  Overall great experience.  Was way too full for dessert so can't speak to that unfortunately :(  good times."}
{"text":"I've mostly heard the same review of this place from anyone I've talked to: martinis? Great. Food? Not so much. So I was pretty skeptical in coming here for dinner before heading to a play at State Theater, but still decided to give it a try. 
     We started out with an appetizer of spinach artichoke dip, which was delicious. It came in a crock with two types of bread and some veggies for dipping. The pita bread was a little heard for my taste, but still good. 
     Our drinks were definitely the star of the experience at $10 a piece. To start, I ordered the Chocolate Dipped Strawberry martini, which tastes exactly like its name. I tried the Chocolate Orange martini and Chocolate Banana Cream Pie martini that my mother and sister ordered and you could definitely taste the alcohol more in their drinks than mine. In fact, my sister and I had to trade because she couldn't take the taste of her Chocolate Orange. Next, I ordered the Raspberry Truffle martini, which was stronger than my last and very tasty. My sister ordered The Key Lime Pie martini, which came with a pie crust rim and was good. My mother decided to try the Dark Chocolate with Chilies, which was probably my favorite of the night. It came garnished with whipped cream, which I am not a fan of, but also with a spicy rim and a kick to the aftertaste. They have so many martinis that there is definitely something for everyone. 
      Our food experience was just good, not great. I ordered the sirloin with Jack Daniels sauce. I ordered it medium rare, and it came out perfect with sweet potato fries and asparagus on the side. My only complaint is that they covered the steak in sauce instead of putting it on the side, so I couldn't taste much of the meat. My mother is a vegetarian and ordered the grilled cheese without bacon. Again, it was just okay. My sister ordered Mac and cheese with mushrooms, which came with bacon instead. It looked like they cooked up some Kraft Mac and cheese from the box and crumbled some bacon on top. My sister was not too impressed. 
     Overall, our experience was good. Our server (Atoryia) was extremely nice and helpful. My mother and I ordered Caesar salads that we did not receive before our meal, so she took them off the bill but brought them anyway. The place was a little louder than I expected and you have to go outside and downstairs into a creepy hallway for the bathroom, but the decór was nice. If I were to go back, I think I would just stick to appetizers and martinis."}
{"text":"Being stuffed from dinner, I wasn't so sure about heading to Chocolate Bar.  It sounded great but my tummy was a little mad at me.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a HUGE martini menu, which included several different options.  My friend ordered the Chocolate Pretzel Martini, which was ridiculously good.  I wanted something a little less rich and the bartender suggested the Swedish Fish Martini.  I didn't think it was possible, but it did taste like a Swedish Fish.  Had I not been so tired and full, I would have liked to try some more of the martini options!"}
{"text":"We had a really nice experience even with a hiccup or two. We are from out of town and the chocolate based menu looked good to me (my wife doesnt really like chocolate!?!) but she was excited to have a decent salad after eating junk at Cedar Point all day. The place wasnt too busy for a Tuesday night, and the service was attentive. We had a specialty hot chocolate (choc cherry) and a peanut butter chocolate martini (which tasted like a huge p b cup with lots of vodka infused peanut butter at the bottom. It was gloppy but tasty.) We had tomato basil soup (good and hot soup of the day and my wife had a great salad with goat cheese and almonds and cherries which she added chicken to.  It was definitely on point. My dish, the Pecan crusted chicken? Well not so much. Came out almost blackened. I thought it was a special crust at first, till I tasted it. Then I realized it was special... Specially burnt. Couldnt be eaten. I called the waitress over and asked if this looked normal to her. She said, \"looks kinda burned huh?\" We agreed it was, and she left for a minute. Soon the manager (very sweet) was at my table. She said \"Oh no.. Not good..\" and whisked away my plate. The waitress offered me more soup while I was waiting for the new plate, which came out in 5 minutes or so. Much better. Wouldnt order that dish again, but 3 different people came by to check on me afterwards. The service as I said was top notch. We didnt even have room for the awesome looking desserts.  Maybe tomorrow. They did look good though."}
{"text":"Despite the good and the bad review, we went to see for ourself. I should make better judgement. If viewer don't want to read the full spill. Here's my version of Cliff Note: Bad service. So-so food. Good Martinis. No good beer selections. Bring a flashlight if you have vision challenge.

The place is nothing but a Martini joint and food served on menu. It's all hyped up place. Anyone with seeing in the dark, bring a flashlight. If you are seated in the corner, you may need some extra lighting. Someone in the Marketing department need to know what works in the dark lighting. All the menu are laminated as if you are in Eat N' Park Restaurant. The reflection and white color font on drink menu makes it imppossible to read. Also if you have bad night vision or walking in dim light restaurant, bring a flashlight. A poor elderly gentlemen took a dive to the floor wondering around the restaurant looking for restroom.  Restroom is located behind the shoe sine place down the cold staircase. Handicap folks, there's an elevator if you need one. I think it works. Maybe it's for Hyatt Hotel guest.

Service was bad. If reservation are needed because the place is so busy, buff up some server service. I was observing the bar all night and they don't even have enough bartenders to meet the demand in the restaurant. Don't get me wrong. The Martinis are fabulous. I can see waiting for the Martinis to be perfectly crafted would be fair wait time. To wait twice as long for someone to pop the cap off the beer bottle is ridiculous. If it was for my wife and I, I would have walked out and go somewhere else. I was trying to behave myself and be good company.

If you are not eating, you get to sit on the high top tables. Reservation is recommeded to drink. ???? Figure that out. Serving a $10 Martini on an unbalanced tabletop is uncall for. Attention to detail is lacking.

Food is nothing to be impressed about except bad bad impression. Jason V. is defintely right about the Mac-N-Cheese. The first look is very impressive with a huge plate and overload on carb to help soak up the Martinis. The Kraft Mac&Cheese with fake cheese powder taste 10 times better than that. The Chef must have forgot to add cheese to the Mac & Cheese. It taste bland. Moving on. I ordered a Mexican Pork Tenderloin and it was so so. I didn't even get knife to cut the meat. Looks nice on presentation. I was expecting a burst of Mexican flavor and cocoa flavor bursting in my mouth. Guess not. Four measly piece of Pork Tenderloin medalion. Like an appetizer portion for me. Not a dinner portion. Other friends ordered sandwiches and they like them.

Like Bryn R says, I would enjoy my meal better at friendly neigbourhood bar like Applebees or TGI Friday. Flavor are far more developed than Chocolate Bar.

Manager on duty. My advise: Should pay more attention to customer and attention to details. 

I don't mind dining at downtown Cleveland. The Chocolate Bar is my last visit to it. I can always go for Martinis elsewhere where reservation is not needed."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving this place 1 star. We showed up at 1:20 in the afternoon. There were a few tables open and they seated us. Our server came over 1:35 and took our drink and food order. The bar was completely empty and we watched people count their tips and talk with each other. 25 minutes later, still no drinks or food. So my party decided to leave and I asked to speak with a manager. Her exact response \"sorry\". That's it. Wow, I have never had this bad of service ever at a restaurant. Walk down the street and try another location. We will never return to the chocolate bar."}
{"text":"Filet unfortunately was not good. Cooked perfectly, but flavor wasn't good and was pretty dry. Tried a dessert frozen hot chocolate, and unfortunately was like trying to drink the last of a frappucino that you had finished all the good juicy flavor from minutes earlier, but end up with just the icy remnant at bottom without much flavor. Eww. Great location, servers were nice, but food needs some work."}
{"text":"I took my mom here when I visited, and we enjoyed it. The service was extremely friendly, and the food and desserts were very good. I had a truffle cake which was rich, creamy, and fresh. 

I found it to be expensive, though, and I'm used to NY prices."}
{"text":"This was our first time stopping in. Will not be our last! Hostess and servers were very friendly and accommodating. My mother ordered the Salmon Cakes and I ordered the Chocolate Strawberry Crepes. We were both very impressed with how delicious our food was. Also everything was very reasonably priced. Because of its location, right on East 4th, were were expecting a much pricier meal. Overall we were very pleased. We cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here before dinner somewhere else. Amazing martinis!  Love the atmosphere and decor. Staff and bartenders are great. We got a chocolate and espresso martini!  Very very good!  Typical price for a martini in the city."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Bar is a great place to grab a specialty drink with your girlfriends.  They have a bunch of fun martini flavors such as chocolate covered pretzel and chocolate strawberry.  However their food is mediocre for the price they charge and I have had slow, inconsistent service multiple times.  Try to avoid during its busiest hours."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time exploring the food down on euchlid & when I saw this place, I knew right then that that is where I wanted lunch. I had the chocolate covered strawberry martini. It was so good!  I also got the artichoke & spinach dip appetizer which came with bread, pita, & veggies. I enjoyed that. I ordered their turkey club.  It tasted great & wasn't greasy. My friend & I spent over an hour there eating & people watching. Sit outside or inside at the glass window & you can watch the world. Our waitress gave us wonderful service.  I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third time at this restaurant and it was great, I can't remember having a bad experience the first two times either.  The first time I came was for my bachelorette party which was almost two years ago. We stopped here to eat and exchange gifts and then headed over to the casino. I can't recall exactly what dish or martini I had, but I remember thinking the martinis were delicious.  The second time I came about a year and a half ago was for lunch with my colleagues. I remember getting a grilled cheese with french onion soup.  I remember the soup was very good.  

As for my visit yesterday I had wanted to try the coconut Mahi Mahi, but it was no longer on their menu although it is listed on their website. I got the garden grilled chicken instead and it was good - not fantastic - but had some flavor and was plentiful.  It came with crostini bread which was ok - again not fantastic.  I did not go for the martini this time because we were out for my birthday and I wanted some good ol' chocolate cake.  My friend got the salted caramel martini and loved hers and I had the chocolate brulee mousse.  My friend had a piece and said that it was \"too much chocolate\" but for a chocolate lover like me - it was divine!  It came with a cherry glaze on the side and whipped cream - I ate everything! 

The service was ok.  Honestly there really isn't anything fantastic about this place but it's not horrible either - I would definitely come back again and again.  As for pricing, I would say its moderate. The martinis are $10 which is steep but their filet mignon dish is under $20 which is reasonable.  

I do appreciate that this restaurant is handicap accessible for my friend who uses a wheelchair.  Also the atmosphere is such that you can have a casual get together with friends or a more romantic-casual date night. Also you just can't beat the energy of E. 4th street!  I think next time I will be back to try their brunch - I hear they have mimosas!"}
{"text":"Night started off well with good drinks however when food arrived there was a cobweb hanging off my plate and a piece of plastic wrapper in my chicken! Manager came out and comp'd my meal only .... Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"2nd visit. 1st time was for dinner...nothing memorable (but definitely sub-par for the area), chocolate martini was not our thing.  

This time was for coffee/dessert only after a play, ca. 9p on a Thursday night. Party of 4.

Waitress was great, and steered us away from a few items when we asked (she mentioned the cupcakes were brought in and refrigerated so were often dry at that hour). She also mentioned that they don't bake anything in-house (\"everything is brought in from corporate\").

Coffee was luke-warm (both the first and the refill). Two in our party got specialty cheesecake - the slices were very small (but really rich, so plenty for 1+). The other two of us got a run-of-the-mill brownie sundae (big enough to split 4-ways) and creme brulee (torched table-side, nice touch).

Bill for 4 deserts and 2 coffee was ca. $40 + tip. 

Plenty of other places on East 4th - try any of those instead (Greenhouse Tavern is always a winner, or Lolita if you are up for a splurge)."}
{"text":"For me it's the buffalo chicken Cobb salad and the chocolate dipped strawberry martini afterwards that's the winning combination but actually almost the entire menu is good. Decent service too. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely Incredible. Drinks and food and service  Definitely will be a regular stop"}
{"text":"Looking so forward to celebrating 42 years with my wife out of all the places to eat I chose the chocolate bar I've had the prime rib before and thought it to be awesome ask for bread which never arrived ask for king cut prime rib med rare only to receive it well wait apologized and returned with a piece medium after talking to the manager hep it's hard to get medium rare after 9pm I said you should have let me know that did not eat it and he still charged me for it    You won't see me again"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it is difficult for me to give a thorough review since all I had were two drinks at the bar, but I can say this place is worth giving a shot if you have never been! Wether you are just visiting, or you live in the Cleveland area, it was a fun experience!"}
{"text":"This should be a lot of fun. Stopped in after a show at the Q - coffee, drinks and a snack. Ordered 2 decafs, 3 desserts and 2 savory dishes. Amazingly dessert came before the savory dishes and items we asked for on the side didn't come on the side. Coffee delivered and by the time we got silverware and coffee service, the coffee was like wArm. Most entertaining was that the ice cream that went with the crepe was delivered 10 minutes BEFORE the crepe. Kitchen was clearly in the weeds. Feel bad for the server but she didn't even acknowledge it. Sorry chocolate bar, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Price isn't too bad, but the service was really slow. I am a cupcake fanatic and got their cupcake trio. Less than desirable the their icing on top was frozen!!! :-("}
{"text":"The chocolate bar is alright. A little on the expensive side. 

They definitely have decent desserts. And I liked the chocolate sandwich but the other food I've had there was not super amazing. Both times I've been here my server has disappeared for long periods of time. Definitely not a place to go in you need to get in and out quick."}
{"text":"The patio seating Is a great touch, but every time I have been here, the service is lacking greatly. I came for the happy hour special to see what it was about and was very disappointed. The happy hour specials had nothing to do with their infamous chocolate martinis, but rather well drinks, which was confusing."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited over an hour for our food when the restaurant was not even busy. We had reservations and our table wasn't even set up when we arrived. Server never brought ketchup or jam until after our food came and that was another 5 minute wait. Server messed up the separate checks. Was super embarrassed we picked that place to host our out of town guests. Very, very disappointed. Will not ever go back!"}
{"text":"Go here just for the drinks or dessert. Food is less than exceptional. Part of me thinks \"but this is what midwestern food tastes like\" in short: bland and flavorless. I had a salad with grilled chicken on top that was flavor-free. The tastiest thing was the leafy greens. My partner had another dish that was not very good and sent most of it back. We were not compensated after sharing we were not happy with that dish by the manager, even when staff advocated for us. 

Not sure if this is what to expect of cuisine in the mid-US, but if it is, stick with chipotle down the block. Front door location is NOT accessible as there are two steps in front of the front doors which pull outward. There are other doors you will have to enter the actual building it is connected to in order to enter through an accessible door. 

Did not use restrooms, which were outside of the restaurant. Bar seems high and if you are in a wheelchair you won't be able to order at the bar ever. $50 meal was not worth it and now we know there is better elsewhere.

Our service was great with the staff."}
{"text":"Our server was great but the owner was a complete jerk. I set my 90% full drink down on a table next to where my friends were sitting so I could turn and talk to them. Within a couple of minutes my drink was removed from the table and when I turned around my drink was gone. The server apologized and brought me a new drink. However, the owner came out to us and told me that because I set my drink down on another table while I was talking to my friends it was my fault that my drink was thrown away. He told me not to do that again and scolded me like a child. The server told us this man was the owner and I couldn't be more disappointed that such a rude individual could own a business in the city of Cleveland. This man has zero tact and class and should not be in the service industry. Unfortunately, he ruined my experience and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I guess, after reading other reviews, that we were lucky we went for drinks and appetizers.

We had a very long break between the wedding ceremony and the reception, which was being held in the arcade.  This was convenient since the out of town guests were staying right here at the hotel.  So, in we went.  There were at least 20 in our group and we had no problem with service.  The nachos were yummy and most of the group had wine or beer.  No one ordered any fancy drinks, but you could smell them, and they did smell good.

Maybe things have gotten better, maybe we got lucky, but we were able to relax before we all had to go get dressed to attend the reception."}
{"text":"I had high hopes walking in here. The desserts were mediocre.  None of the cakes in the display impressed me so went with the molten lava cake and wasn't too happy about it. The plain hot chocolate on the other hand was everything I wanted."}
{"text":"After another visit to add to the many before I love them even more. Recently reviewed and gave them a 4 out of 5 but between the delicious martinis and now trying their variety of warm drinks I'm even more in love. Best reccomendation I can give you is if you go there get some form of a Chocolate drink (hence the name).  Chocolate bar you just get me."}
{"text":"Chocolate bar, I wish you had been better.

Stopped her for part of my birthday celebration. Having never tried this restaurant, I thought it would a great way to get my dessert before I had my birthday dinner.

Luckily, they were super accommodating for a medium size group of peoples. We mostly just ordered desserts or drinks.. so I have no review of the food.

The chocolate bar mocha was okay. A tad sweet and didn't really taste like any coffee flavored. I was actually a fan of the alpine white hot chocolate- that was sure good. I ordered the Belgian mousse cake...which was dry. I also ordered the Georgia peach...which was way too sweet.

I don't know. For a dessert place, they sure weren't impressive. I mean, with a name like chocolate bar....you expect more than average, I suppose?"}
{"text":"I came here again last night for some dessert - the service was in fact great. It was speedy too. If you hate waiting for hours, come during off hours if you can. We tried the chocolate fondue this time - I liked it. It was a huge amount of stuff for $19. The chocolate was a little on the watery side and it was not warm enough, which I didn't have a big problem with. The items include cookies, oreos, bananas (unflavored and sugar coated), rice crispies, pretzels, strawberries, pineapples, marshmallows, etc. I think you can also order scoup-size ice cream to go with it as well, but the waiter didn't give me the price for it and we were too full to add the ice cream anyways."}
{"text":"Not bad but don't think it's something I'd care to go back to. We went last night after a concert. It wasn't too busy (we were seated right away). Waiter got our drink orders, it seemed to take a long time to get them, about 15 minutes and then he came back a bit later to take our food order, would've appreciated ordering while waiting on drinks but he never even came by to ask. He did apologize though when he came to give us our drinks. I didn't care for my martini, the alcohol was too strong in it so didn't finish it. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was good. Waiter took a while to bring the bill though. But overall not excellent, but not terrible either"}
{"text":"The service was great. Server was quick and friendly with everything and the manager came over and talked with us for a few minutes. 

I got a shake because how could I not get something chocolatey at the chocolate bar? That was very rich and came with a chocolate straw. 

What bring this down is the fact that I found a hair that definitely wasn't mine on one piece of my flatbread. I understand it happens, and I carefully ate the rest of it without sending it back or anything, but it's still not good. Also, the bathrooms are public bathrooms outside of the building and down some stairs."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey, but it's totally worth it, especially for a nice treat. I've been here twice and the service is not the best (pretty slow), but I was still able to stop over for lunch in under an hour. I even went just after 12, which I almost never do downtown because of the lunch rush. Of course the martinis are to die for! They are too delicious. I've also had their lunch special, which for under $7 is good deal here. I had the soup of the day (chicken florentine) and the tuscan sandwich. The soup was amazing and  the sandwich was decent. The portion is definitely small, but luckily I got a drink too which filled me up. 

What makes this place the best is the desserts and drinks. For those who just assume that a place should put chocolate in all of its food solely because of the name, you should realize that when it comes to chocolate bar, the drinks and desserts are the specialty. I've had the salted caramel hot chocolate and although it wasn't at all salty (sad for me since I love the sweet and salty combo), it was still one of the best drinks I've ever had. It did cost about $6, but honestly it was worth twice that! I'm definitely willing to look past the mediocre service and the prices for their fantastic drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food that came at a nice pace. However our waiter was exceptionally rude. He was tending to us well but his language towards my family and I was shocking. I would definitely go back in hopes to not have this waiter again."}
{"text":"I'd never go into CB expecting fabulous service. It's not one of their known quantities. We went there during Restaurant Week with friends who'd never been and were excited to try it. The host promptly took us to our table, which was near the back door of the place.

As we sat down I noticed one of the water glasses on the table had dried food stuck inside it. A busser brought over a pitcher of water for us and I asked for a new glass. She brought one over right away and apologized. My husband and I were waiting for our friends to arrive so we were just chatting and looking over the menu. After about 10 minutes, our server, Jay, hollered from a distance that he'd be right with us. I understand they were busy; it was almost 8pm on a Saturday during Restaurant Week, so we nodded and said that was fine. Maybe 15 minutes after that, our friends had arrived and Jay came back over to take our drink orders. He was very friendly and chatty as he took our orders, so much so that my friend had to repeat herself twice when she ordered her martini. After we placed the drink orders, he explained that all of the specials that were available during RW were all prepped in the oven. He said that since most of their entrees are usually prepped stovetop, their ovens were backed up and if we wanted the specials we should tell him ASAP so that he could get our orders in soon. During this, he talked over our table at the customers next to us to say that the manager would be coming over to them soon. To us, he explained that they were upset about the situation with the specials. 

He left to put in our drink orders and we discussed what we were going to order. Our friends decided to go with the specials and my husband and I ordered off their regular menu. Jay came back with our drinks and we placed our orders. We started with the classic nachos (delicious) and our friends had the potstickers. When he came back to check how our apps were, my friend remembered that she had also wanted to order the CB Pasta so they could try it. Jay groaned to himself and said he'd really have to go get a drink somewhere that night since he was having such a hard day. My husband and my friend's husband each ordered another drink. I was going to order another one as well, but Jay was talking as he walked away so I didn't have the opportunity and he didn't ask if my friend or I wanted anything. He came back with the guys' drinks and one for himself and he surreptitiously drank his with his back to most of the restaurant. My husband had to ask for a new glass since his had lipstick marks on it. 

A different guy (who was dressed a little nicer than the servers, leading me to think he was a manager) brought over our entrees with the help of a busser. I had the pork tenderloin, husband had the Cajun chicken pasta and our friends had crab cakes and a flatbread. Everyone enjoyed their food! Granted, it had taken so long to get to us I probably would have happily eaten cardboard at this point. I then asked Jay for a glass of wine when he had time, which actually came over fairly quickly. 

My friends reminded him that they'd ordered the CB pasta, which had never come out. He apologized and said he'd have it out right away; my friends said that he could just take it off the bill. At this point we'd finished our entrees and had been there for over an hour, so they weren't interested in getting another dish. I asked for a box for my leftovers. He came back about 10 minutes later to say that the pasta had been taken off their bill. My friends reminded him that they had ordered dessert, which was included in the price of their RW meals. He apologized and said he would go back there and make them himself. I asked again for a box. Jay brought out their desserts. My friends decided to share one dessert there and take the second one home. They asked for a box for their dessert and I asked for a third time for a box for my food. At this point we'd been sitting with our dirty dishes in front of us for more than 30 minutes, as well as our empty glasses from the first round of drinks. Jay came back with boxes and apologized all over the place. He asked if we wanted anything else (I'm thinking to myself: I want to leave!!!) and we asked for the checks.

We easily could have stiffed him if that's the kind of people we were, seeing as how we were right next to a door and he took SO LONG to bring us anything, including the check. The only reason I'm giving this review two stars instead of one is that the food was good. I feel embarrassed that we came with friends whose first impression of CB was that train wreck. There are so many other restaurants in Cleveland, I'm amazed that this place is still around. Yuck."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night as we were staying upstairs at the Hyatt Arcade,

It was pretty crowded when we walked in but we found a seat in the window area pretty quickly. Was served by an over pushy server who seemed put off when we didn't order food with our drinks.

After perusing the menu we decided on the steak bruschetta and the french onion soup as the couple next to us was having a bowl and it looked good. Waitress came back a minute later and said they were out of soup. Guess it would have been improper to wrestle that couple for theirs so we just got the bruschetta.

It was ok, Pretty much a slice of semi chewy meat on toast with cheese and red pepper. It probably wouldn't even had rated as ok except all it was all I had eaten all day.

I had lots of opportunity to go back, but never really saw a reason. The martinis looked overly sweet. I guess it would be a good place for an after dinner drink but I see the appeal for eating or happy hour."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet (ha! get it?): Not my thing.

Stopped at Chocolate bar with a few friends relatively late on a weekend evening after participating in some other shenanigans on E4th.  

Overall, there was nothing ostensibly \"bad\" about our visit other than the service being a little slow, but there wasn't anything remarkable that stood out to me either.  

The menu seemed to cover a lot of bases, shooting for an all things to all people sort of vibe, which never really excites me.  Various desserts were ordered at our table and all of them we ok, but nothing I haven't had better versions of elsewhere.  

I think Chocolate bar is probably a great choice for certain segments of the population who don't  get out much, and are excited to have a little chocolaty decadence in a \"hip\" setting like E4th.  It also might do in a pinch if you were marooned downtown and wanted to find something to satisfy a sweet tooth.  If, on the other hand, you're not stuck downtown and want to exert a quarter of an effort to get some tasty treats, then you're really not going to miss anything at Chocolate bar."}
{"text":"When I saw \"long-stemmed rose\" on the menu, I knew I made a big mistake coming here. This place was more \"cheese\" than chocolate.

I was initially very excited when I saw the Chocolate Bar open up, having had great experiences with hip chocolate & dessert-themed restaurants in other cities, thinking it would be perfect to have something similar here in Cleveland. As it turns out, my naive enthusiasm was completely unwarranted. Chocolate Bar is waste of a prime downtown location, and huge missed opportunity for bringing something unique to the Cleveland dining scene.. 

Here's what I don't understand: if you're are going to compete on dessert with the other top-tier restaurants on East 4th or elsewhere downtown, wouldn't you want to offer something AT LEAST on par with those restaurants? (You're going head-to-head with Symon's legendary maple bacon ice cream, for chrissakes! ) If you expect diners to vacate their tables at Lola, Zocala, and the Greenhouse Tavern in favor of your restaurant for dessert, don't you need to offer a menu of creative, interesting alternatives??? 

Instead, the dessert menu at Chocolate Bar is pedestrian and predictable, offering the same chocolate-based desserts you can find on practically any standard restaurant menu: molten lava cake, cheesecake, mousse, chocolate sorbet. There's nothing savory, nothing unique. You can find a more compelling dessert menu at Applebee's. 

Add extremely poor execution on top of this, and you've got a total disaster. Our server looked like she woke up behind a dumpster, and acted as though she was mildly drunk. She made Paul Westerberg look \"polished.\" The decor is uninspired and generic (think Panera or Einstein Bagels), and neither intimate nor cool. The music was just awful, too, wandering all over the musical map in schizophrenic directions. It would shift from jazz to rock to 80's pop music in strange, unpreditable ways. (I don't want to end my evening being subjected to the Worst of Steely Dan....which is, technically, all of it.) 

Some of the dishes my friends received were so-so, but my cinnamon ice cream was horrifying. There was a small mountain of whipped cream on top, recalling the Dreyfuss mashed potatoes scene from Close Encounters. I broke out some heavy mining equipment just to reach the sickly-sweet ice cream buried somewhere underneath. And the presentation was unbelieveably lame and childish. I felt like I had mistakenly ordered off the Kid's Menu at Friendly's. 

By the end of this experience, I was so angry I wanted to grab the owners by the collar and smack them across the face for being so dim-witted. I have no idea what market they are trying to capture. The drunks stumbling out the Cadillac Ranch? I was so embarrased about recommending that we change venues to try this place for dessert, that I ate the bill for all my friends. This place doesn't belong downtown on East 4th...it belongs in a fucking mall parking lot.... somewhere easily accessible to the legions of suburban diabetic teenagers, where they can gaze romantically into each other's acne-riddled faces over 12\" piles of whipped cream and sugar."}
{"text":"Three stars for the white chocolate martini I had for $10 and included a rolled white choc stick.  No stars for our server not understanding my husband's drink order and getting it wrong when he served it.  

And of course, no stars for our server disappearing after he served our drinks.  We waited a fair amount of time before we left cash under a glass on our front patio table, and left.

p.s. another bartender we met that night made gagging noises when we mentioned where we'd been."}
{"text":"I have friends from Youngstown and Columbus who have, separately, specifically request this place for dinner when they come to visit. I don't know why or how they've heard of it - I really don't think it's anything special, especially when it's so close to East 4th Street, and all the great places there.

That being said, The Chocolate Bar isn't TERRIBLE, it's just kind of... meh. the service isn't great, the food is nonmemorable at best, and the desserts and drinks are overpriced. 

I've been there for lunch at least 8 times (never by choice - usually for a \"special\" birthday lunch for a co-worker or something) and I literally cannot recommend a single item that I've ordered. 

Servers and hosts/hostesses are typically rude, or at least, inattentive. The last time I was there, I asked for a refill on my iced tea several times, with our server always promising to bring it right away, and then, before we knew it, she just brought the check, no refill. Annoying.

In the spirit of fairness, I can see that the desserts look good, though I have never ordered one, which I guess deserves an extra star rating."}
{"text":"Overpriced considering the quality. Food is a little below mediocre (my pecan chicken was flavorless. Have they never heard of seasoning??) & my friend's Alfredo pasta had way too much garlic and was inferior to the Olive Garden. Drinks are good if expensive. Spiked hot chocolate is very good tho and worth it"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner from 7 pm to 8:30 pm on Wednesday,  May 4th 
The service was slow and the food, when it finally arrived has been overcooked.  It was dried out.  We had Pecan crusted chicken, Pork roast, a filet and crab cakes.  they all were over done and dried out.  The prices would have been considered a little high if the food was properly prepared,  but were exorbitant in light of the quality.."}
{"text":"Was walking in downtown Cleveland, looking for a quiet bar on a chilly January day all by my lonesome, and the Chocolate Bar seemed to fit the bill. And I wasn't in the mood for a stroll around city looking (as per the aforementioned cold), so I ventured inside the establishment, after foolishly wandering about looking for the entrance, but that's more my fault than the Chocolate Bar!

I'm going to warn you at the forefront, I have yet to have the chance to eat any food here, but I had an amazing experience with the staff that will ensure that I always have a soft spot for the Chocolate Bar. After sitting down at the bar (as in, the row of stools situated parallel to a \"bar\" where you place your drinks, foods, and elbows. Not the restaurant in question.) I unzipped my jacket, and then, horror of horrors, off my zipper went. I'm in Cleveland on business for a couple of months, and this was my only jacket. Suffice to say, my brain went through a mental, bitter Midwestern cold fearing, apocalyptic moment. I attempted to find a way to get the zipper back onto the teeth of the jacket for about twenty minutes, while in between drinking a little of their chocolate milk. Then the bartender, who sewed as a hobby offered to help me with getting the zipper back on my jacket. She spent the next hour, in between preparing and serving drinks, helping me get the zipper back on. Later, another member of the staff came over, and helped us figure out the final piece to repairing my jacket.

The two important things to take away here are:

1) Their chocolate milk is fantastic. I don't know what kind of milk or chocolate they used, but it basically tasted like a Godiva bar mixed with 2%. And it was served in a neat-o glass as well. ++

2) The fact that the staff took so much time out to help me with my jacket, is amazing. They certainly didn't have to do that. And boy, am I thankful. With typical 10-30 degree days here, and biting wind chills, if I didn't have a jacket, even for a couple of days until I repaired it or bought a new one, I would have been in a world of hurt. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice in 2 days. I loved the atmosphere and the friendly staff.  The first time I stopped in there was for a drink after dinner. I had a white hot chocolate. It was the best hot chocolate I have ever had. I also had a dessert called dipping berries. It was a bowl of berries--blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and pineapple with a bowl of chocolate fondue for dipping. The chocolate was so smooth and delicious and the fruit was ripe and juicy. I was pleasantly surprised. 
The next day we attended a play in the theatre district and I couldn't resist another stop at the Chocolate Bar. I had my children with me this time. I ordered the fondue for two. The tray was full of fruit, marshmallows, pretzels, rice crispy treats, vanilla wafers and oreo cookies. The children thought this was the best thing ever! hey were able to pick what they want and dip it in the chocolate. They were in heaven. I will definitely be  stopping by there again the next time I am in the area. I won't be able to resist the temptation!"}
{"text":"Service was great and so was the food.  We had a turkey club which was fabulous.  Southwest chicken salad was very good as well as the chocolate bar pasta.  It was sweet but not overbearing.  Great atmosphere.   For dessert we shared the peanut butter panic and the triple chocolate fusion.  We had cappuccinos and were in love with everything."}
{"text":"I only went there because it was at the Hyatt Hotel (which I was staying at) along with my client.  We had some dinner, it was alright, we had the bistro steak sandwich, it was pretty tasty but could've used a bit more steak in the sandy.  The cocktails were alright as well, not anything to write home about.

The service was good, we never had an empty glass.  

Again, it was alright...would go there again but only because I'll be staying at that hotel."}
{"text":"Will never step foot I this place again.  We came in after the Cavs home opener last weekend.  My brother who has had 3 brain tumors tends to  have a little \"stumble\" in his walk after his surgeries.  We sat down, and immediately a manager came and stood at the end of the bar as like she was watching us.  My brother went downstairs to use the restroom and the bartender comes over to take our order & says \"I will not seve him, he's too intoxicated\".  He judged my brother by the way he walked.  He never talked to my brother to see if he was in fact too intoxicated.  My brother was not causing a scene, was not acting crazy,  we simply walked into the bar and sat down.   When he came up from the bathroom & was embarrassed for being \"cutoff\" for no reason.  At that point we had only ordered one drink, the remaining three of us split the drink, paid and left.  We walked across the street where they happily took our money & laughed when we explained what had just happened.  The next day I emailed the Chocolate Bar and didn't even get a response."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hyatt and passed by the Chocolate Bar on our way to The Q. We looked at the menu and thought it may be a cool place to check out. After the game, we stopped by 4th Street Bar & Grill, but only the bar area was open.  We decided to walk over to Chocolate Bar. 

We were seated quickly and given the full menu. We ordered drinks which came quickly. When we placed our order, the waitress said \"I'm sorry, we only serve desserts after 9. I couldn't believe it. Why didn't she tell us that when she gave us THE FULL MENU to look at? We weren't up to going back out into the cold to be disappointed again, so we ordered desserts. I had ordered a glass of wine to go with my meal. I then had to order coffee with my dessert. The wine went to waste. 

There were three of us. We ordered three different desserts and they were all just ok. We witnessed a table of six come in and taking a long time to decide what they wanted. The waitress came over to take their order and then told them that they were only serving dessert. 

What's up with these people? Do they enjoy torturing people or are they really that stupid when it comes to running a good business? I'll be back at the Hyatt in June, but I will stay as far away from the Chocolate Bar as possible."}
{"text":"What a terrific place for chocolate lovers!! chocolate martinis, breakfast with chocolate, food with chocolate dribble, wow!!"}
{"text":"I just got here about 20 minutes ago to have a few drinks before hitting the town.  The staff near the door asked me what they could do for me and I asked if I could be seated for drinks at a table. They motioned towards the window, and I  then excused myself for a moment to use the restroom.  When  I returned and sat in the same area that was motioned to,  the same guy that interacted with  when i walked in, asked me to follow him up to the front to be seated,  as if I snuck in and was committing some crime. Ummmm, dude you Just spoke to me 2 minutes ago. For that treatment,  a star has been deducted.  (Overall,  seemed like a nice guy, but cmon) Now, on to the martinis.  

Chocolate Banana Cream Pie - deliciously decadent. Tastes like rich dark chocolate.  I can't say I recall tasting any banana, still, it was good. 

My awesome waiter, Taylor,  recommended the Coconut Macaroon martini. Yummm! Tasted exactly as named :-)

I can't comment on the food but I will say that,  as this place is ideally situated directly across from a party strip of bars, it's a nice way to start of the evening. I hope you get Taylor - genuinely nice person :-)"}
{"text":"The first time I went here 3 years ago, I thought I was in love. But since then I have experienced the chocolate bar multiple times and it has never really lived up to my standards. Don't get me wrong, I can't complain about an all chocolate menu TOO much but I really expect more from a place with such big claims.

First off, the dessert. It's good, but not great. After the first bite you realize that its similar to something you could have gotten at a nice grocery store bakery instead of an establishment defined by the dessert. You can tell they are plated right out of the fridge/freezer and seem like they are made from a very generic, processed chocolate base. 

I also attempted The Chocolate Bar for brunch and was not pleased. First off, there weren't a lot of chocolate or sweet options, which was my intention for going there. I decided on the biscuits and gravy and they were oily and not very flavorful. As someone who loves brunch, I was disappointed.

Most recently I went to The Chocolate Bar for cocktails for the first time. I was really excited to try the multiple chocolate martinis but was not a fan at all. Really, the drink had the ability to ruin chocolate for the night for me. At first it made me want to order a piece of cake but a few sips in I realized I was just sipping on a confusing mix of sugar that tasted nothing like what I had ordered. (I tried both the S'mores and Nutella).

Overall, the chocolate bar is an experience, but one that I would only want to have once."}
{"text":"Good place for dinner. Was told it was an hr wait on a Saturday night but only took 20minutes. All the martini's were amazing and the food was good as well. I gave them 3 stars due to the service we received when my husbands steak was well done instead of medium rare. They did not want to give him another steak due to him eating some of it from trying to find some pink. They did not want to work with us at all and kept saying he ate some of it and some of the sides. So he ended up getting the jalapeño shrimp and it was ok. Couldn't taste the jalapeño though. I got the chocolate bar pasta and it was very good! All in all was a cool experience and will go again."}
{"text":"Can't beat their variety of dessert-style martinis.  They are pure art-work.  I am not a big fan of their food, however.  Stick with their sinful desserts and drinks and you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Brian was our bartender. A man with a million stories and he's from COLUMBUS - BAM! I knew we were in good hands. :) He had a Russian dude with him behind the bar. Awesome. I wanted my tried and true lemon drop martini - no flack for this order in a chocolate bar. Thank you. I just wanted a cocktail while my BFF was going all out with a Dark Chocolate Chilean Martini. She swears that was the best martini she's ever had in her life ever.  We captured it on instagram to prove it. :)  

We'll be back."}
{"text":"I like coming here when in Cleveland as I often stay at the Hyatt inside the Arcade and this is a convenient place to grab lunch or dinner. This last time I had the Caprese panini and I wasn't disappointed. Of course the meal wasn't complete without sharing the chocolate peanut butter shake with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Loved it here!! Awesome food and atmosphere; perfect for if you are coming from seeing a show!"}
{"text":"I had a great experiene at this place, my server was great. Her name was Tara I believe...
A little pricy but, worth it. You have to try the Black Forest. Any food is good also."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. If I could give it 0 stars I would! This place is terrible. I should have written this review a long time ago when it actually happened! But I didn't have a yelp account. My husband and I went here after a comedy show downtown to grab desert. My husband got a giant sundae and I got a strawberry fondue dish. The strawberry's were not ripe and were a bit mushy. My husband was about 50% through his sundae and as he pulls his spoon up, I'm like \"do not eat that!\" There was a ball of pubic hairs, like I mean a ball. It looked like they had cleaned out a brush, that's how much there was. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen and it had clearly been placed there on purpose. It was No accident. We called the server over and he didn't seem too concerned. He took the sundae off of the check and only the sundae. My husband just wanted to get out of there. I wish I would have taken a picture of it and spoke to a manager. But I was in so much shock and we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night for dinner, had reservations but were not needed.  Got a nice table near the window to people watch which was nice.  The waitress was very nice and helpful as it was my first time there.

The appetizer was the Chocolate Baguette, it was okay, the low point of the meal honestly.  It was very messy, would have been nice if it was chopped up, just cutting it made a large mess.  The chips and hot chocolate dip was the best part of that appetizer.

Drinks were great, creme brulee and choc pretzel martinis are recommended.

The main course I had a steak, perfectly done, and no room for dessert, will skip apps next time and add dessert, they looked good as they made their way to other tables.

Defiantly would recommend and be back soon."}
{"text":"I like this venue. Went here after a walking tour of the Civic area. We were seated right away, and surprise!  Leon, who was our excellent waiter at last visit, was our waiter again!  Request him!  He made suggestions, answered our questions, was patient. My girl friend ordered her first ever chocolate martini after Leon told her about the top three favorites. I ordered Young's Double Chocolate stout which was, strangely, served cold in a warm glass which Leon explained. Both drinks were fabulous! The salad and flatbread were delicious. The prices are the best of anywhere for dinner. We split the bill, which was nicely divided in half. Chocolate Bar has become a favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Chocolate Bar has a huge menu so it's easy for nearly anyone to find something they'd like! Very similar to Cheesecake Factory with the food options and portion sizes. I love their French onion soup, creme brûlée, drinks and brunch. The atmosphere and service could use a little important but over all it's a fun place to go in the center of downtown!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love the Chocolate Bar, but I was disappointed by nearly every aspect of our dinner there.

The service was slow and they seemed disorganized and confused from the moment we walked in the door. It was Restaurant Week, but we had to ask for a restaurant week menu. The server only brought one (we had 6 people) and it had writing on it! 

We waited nearly a half hour for drinks. The drinks did come with an apology, but the whole dinner took more than 2 hours. Half our table also returned their appetizer plates and asked for clean ones!

The food didn't save them. The chicken and chorizo nachos were tasty, so we were hopeful. My steak BLT sandwich had chewy steak and the cheese looked like it had been sitting out- it was not hot and melted. My friend's chocolate bar pasta was not bad, but not really good. It has a \"white chocolate cream sauce,\" which basically tasted like a slightly sweet Alfredo sauce. 

Dessert was the best part of the meal. They caramelize the creme brûlée right at the table. Our chocolate mousse pyramid was rich and smooth. 

It's unlikely I'll ever go back. If I do it will be for dessert only."}
{"text":"THe menu here is so large. Very good dessert martinis. The raspberry truffle, salted chocolate pretzel, Jolly Rancher were amazing. The peanut butter cup was a little on the thick side.  My friends got engaged that night and the staff was amazing. The filet was good, but my husband got the Mexican Pork Loin and that was really good. I wanted to return to try out more items. Everything sounded good."}
{"text":"The good: Really nice atmosphere , - nice soft music - cute decor 
The bad: The service was really not that great - as most people already stated, one of my friends took a sip out of her martini and expressed to the waiter that she didn't like the taste and wanted to know if she could replace it - he wouldn't let her -- Really dude? - So a waste of $10. The menu wasn't that extensive either - not much to pick from - 
The Ugly: So the waiter put an automatic 18% gratuity on our bill when he gave us our checks -- I'm a great tipper and didn't really mind but I was curious as to why the menu said automatic 18% for 6 or more and there was only 3 of us -- I asked him and he claimed its a 4th street rule, all of the bars and restaurants do it when they have to split the check more then way - umm really? I Later called back up and spoke to the owner and she had no clue what he was talking about, I also called a few 4th street bars and no one else does that-- 
I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Worst service received in all of Cleveland. Came here in a large group, ordered 10 drinks and they came out over a span of 40 minutes. Tables behind us were seated after we put in our Order and their drinks came before ours did. 

By the time half the table finished their drinks the rest of the table hadn't received theirs yet. Worst part is they didn't comp any and also put on full mandatory gratuity."}
{"text":"Stopped into Chocolate Bar at 3:50pm today.  There were at least 25 tables available yet the staff seemed very overwhelmed. Waited ten minutes for the red headed hostess to address us.  We asked for a table for three she asked if we had a reservation.  We did not and she said she could not seat us all the tables were reserved. We commented on the number of available tables and her response was \"like I said, they're all reserved\".  She was a total \"B\" who needed an attitude adjustment.  I'm a chocoholic and I would never recommend this place if you are looking for friendly service."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop while downtown. All drinks are made extremely well and damn near perfection.  Especially their martinis. Food is so so. Good to eat if you are there for awhile and get hungry. But I suggest making this your stop for after dinner drinks ie a chocolate martini. Have one of those, go to your show, then hit up the rest of downtown. Oh and service is great."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a nice and delicious chocolate-filled dessert after a show at the Playhouse. We ordered their \"famous hot chocolate\" and the cookies and cream ice cream. The hot chocolate wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better at home- disappointing. The cookies and cream dessert was terrible! The ice cream itself tasted like off-brand store bought, slimy, flavorless cream. Yuck. Oh, and those \"house made fresh cookies\" y'all were supposed to top it with... yeah, definitely Oreos. We could see plainly they said \"Oreos\" on them  Sorely disappointed, don't waste your time or money here. Go buy some good ice cream from the store and enjoy it on your couch!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out if you are in the CLE area. Highly recommend the crab cakes and ahi tuna wrap. Our waitress, Kathleen was super sweet and informative. Since it was our first time, she explained everything on the menu to us and told us all about their happy hour specials. Highly satisfied"}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Friday night(Cavs Finals). Our server Jordan was great and helpful with menu choices. We ordered the nachos, crab cakes, pecan crusted chicken, filet mignon,  potstickers and the peanut butter and banana sandwich.... a little of everything.  The crab cakes were good, but the slaw was not,  potstickers were very good, the chicken was tasty but I  didn't care for the \"salsa\"(it was just diced pineapple). Pass on the nachos, very bland for nachos.  The chocolate peanut butter mud cake was good, but the Chocolate Lava cake was disappointing (commercial), however the ice cream was good.. at a  extra charge. A good atmosphere and service.. okay good.  GREAT DRINKS...but it is a martini bar"}
{"text":"We came here for a \"girls night out\". I started with a cider bomb of some sort (but drank it as a sipper rather than a shot). It was a good way to start off since the rest of the evening, I had much heavier chocolaty drinks. 

Between the 5 of us, we ordered berries and chocolate for dipping, cheese plate, and chocolate baguette. 
Berries with chocolate for dipping - pretty standard, but fun. 
Cheese plate - was 11.25 so I didn't expect any stupendous cheeses, they were pretty standard, but they weren't bad. Came with crackers, pecans, and apple slices. This was a nice way to break some of the sweet of the other things we ordered. 
Chocolate baguette - kind of strange -  basically a chocolate sandwich served with chips and chocolate dipping sauce. I probably wouldn't order that again. 

As far as the other drinks I tried - skip the cherries & chili's spiked hot chocolate - had a nice flavor but a strange gritty texture which is not what you expect from hot chocolate. The waiter did finally catch on to my hints that it was bad and asked if I wanted another drink. Ended up with blood orange champagne - very nice and refreshing after all that chocolate!

Took home a piece of chocolate mousse cake for my husband - that was good. 

Overall this place is what you would expect by the name, service was decent. Fun place to go if you want a chocolate dessert drink."}
{"text":"Before you go any farther, if you're looking for a review about non-dessert food, this isn't it...so skip on down to the next one.

The reviews for this place have been all over the map, with some folks praising this place up to high heaven and others making this place sound nothing short of awful. Hence, I've always been a bit skittish about taking Sheila F. here on a date. However, after our plans to have dessert at Lolita got derailed tonight, we finally decided to hit up The Chocolate Bar.

This place is located in the Old Arcade downtown, which is a very beautiful and historic building. When I was younger, I used to go there and I remember it being very bustling and packed. Unfortunately, the facility seems to have slowed down a bit. In the future, I hope a few more big vendors and businesses move into the Old Arcade and revitalize it! 

We got a \"split\" of champagne and a piece of Kahlua Heath Bar Cheesecake. The split wasn't as big as advertised, but the champagne itself was good. The cheesecake was quite delicious--it came with a generous helping of whipped cream, a rose and strawberry garnish, and a mini eclair--and the presentation of all of the aforementioned items was very artistic.

Onto the service, which seems to be the bane of many reviewers' existence. For most of our visit, we were pleasantly surprised by the service--the server was friendly and the food came out quickly. However, right at the end, we experienced a slightly longer than usual delay in paying for our meal because our server (who was doubling as the bartender at the time because it was late at night) got into a long conversation with two people who appeared to be out-of-town travelers about Cleveland. (He should have told them to go on Yelp to find out what's good!) I didn't get too peeved with this, because interactions like that can make or break a traveler's view of a town, but I was slightly annoyed by the fact that all sorts of Chocolate Bar staff swarmed around me and didn't take my bill. There were TONS of staff there walking around--I honestly wonder what all of them do!  For the Chocolate Bar's sake, I hope they're a bit more attentive during peak hours when guests are rushing to get to productions at Playhouse Square, Hilarities, or Quicken Loans Arena on time.

I'd definitely go back. As others have said, the food prices do look reasonable, and I'd love to try one of the many interesting martinis on the menu! I'll update this review when I do."}
{"text":"The food and service was really great. I had the Filet Mignon and asked for Medium, however they cooked it more like a well done. Besides that, I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I love the chocolate bar. I go there often with the girls and enjoy wonderful food and drinks. I recommend sitting at the bar on the weekend nights. The bartenders are really nice and do a great job recommending martinis. The mint chocolate and peanut butter cup martinis are great. The Sinammon icecream with a shot of goldschlager is awesome! I've only had the macaroni and cheese with pancetta and it was nicely done as well. Although, the prices are a little expensive, it is good!"}
{"text":"Decor: right when you walk in you feel like you are in a chain such as Cheese Cake Factory.  This restaurant is located in the historic Arcade bundling, yet they failed to maximize on that unique location.

Atmosphere: centrally located downtown, you will get the tourist crowds and the fans from either the Cavs or Indiana game.  There is nothing in the interior to absorb sound so it can get quite noisy.  I wouldn't recommend as a date spot, but more for small groups.

Menu: this is where the restaurant misses the mark.  The menu is not creative by any stretch of the imagination. It's just typical higher end chain food.  For dinner I ordered the crab cakes.  The crab cakes were cooked well breaded in panko which provided a nice texture.  There was very little filler, mostly meat.  The cole slaw side was nothing to brag about--a little heavy on the mayo.  

Expense: very affordable and the price is right for the quality and amount of food you get.  Also, the milkshakes and desserts are on the higher end, but after all, desserts are their specialties.

Return factory:  It's highly unlikely I'll return.  There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely a cute place. I recently moved into the area and wanted to go to the Chocolate bar. Since moving, I've been twice. Food is okay. Drinks are fine. Desserts are amazing. We got the chocolate bar foccacia to share the first time around, which I recommend- VERY good. I also got the chocolate bar pasta. I absolutely did NOT like the pasta. It was sweet and awkward. The happy hour was good- i think I paid 5 dollars for each glass of wine, which is great. I also got the shooters in a \"shooter glass\" made from chocolate- what a joke... it was about an inch tall.... never again. the second time, I just ended up getting dessert and drinks (my usual vodka water). The fondue I shared was good, but the chocolate was not warm when we got it- they were apparently out of tea lights.

all in all- it's good- just not great. i'll definitely be going back to try some more."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place zero stars , but it wasn't an option. The service was absolutely terrible. I was so excited to come here with nine of my friends. It took 15 minutes just for someone to come to our table to say hello. It took another 15 minutes to order our drinks and another 10 to get our drinks. The manager was very rude when we had an issue with a drink that was very poorly made. I work in the restaurant business and was extremely disappointed. I would not recommend this place at all. They also served my friend a half full drink and I watched the bartender fill the rest of the drink with soda water."}
{"text":"We had drinks and dessert here after eating at Green Door across the way. I had the chocolate covered strawberry martini after asking for recommendations from our waitress. I also split the lava cake. The cake was just ok. There wasn't enough \"lava\" for my liking, but the martini was delicious without being overly sweet. I also loved the whipped cream and chocolate straws. The service was ok, but our drinks came way after our dessert. I would go back for drinks if I was visiting Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Ah, yum?  Really?  White Chocolate Martinis?  Ok, call it a chick drink.  They were a perfect desert on the way back up to the room."}
