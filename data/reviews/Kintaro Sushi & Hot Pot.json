{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food in town. This is after being here at least a dozen times for dinner with my friends."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch special hot pot with lamb, fish, cuttlefish balls, tofu, enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage and rice noodles. Was $10.99, and waitress was great about getting more water as I got the Sichuan broth and I was thirsty. This is essentially my favorite ingredients between when I visit my family and when I have visited Las Vegas and had hot pot there. Good portions, and definitely enough to be full.  I wanted to check if it was to my liking before I brought my fiancé along as he has not had hot pot before, and I think next time I will get the all you can eat option if I am hungrier or do 2 lunch specials if I am bringing my fiancé.  They also have sushi which I plan to try out at a later visit."}
{"text":"Place is brand new, and we were the lucky ones to try this new restaurant on opening day .  Service is very attentive and the building is extremely clean.  Sushi was very fresh, excellent presentation! We will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"it says all you can eat on the menu, but during the noon, you only can pick seven item for the hot pot! And the hot pot place is too narrow?I will not go again?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! Food is delicious and staff is very polite and attentive. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is gonna be our new favorite place for hot pot. It is so cheap. The food quality is great and quantity is a lot. Lots of variety in the sauce option , that you can mix and made, customized  our own style!! Sushi quality is good as well. Taste is awesome too. Service is awesome, they kept refiling soup.  All of us are happy . Love it! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had came in here many time. The food was good and fresh and the service was good. But this time my servant was so bad and that piss me off. Her name was Hanna. We need to refill water but her isn't come and never come to ask us what we need. We have to wait for the food so long. Then she forgot our order and mess up the order. I was order some pork meat and she bring out chicken meat but at the end she said that we left the chicken over next time she will charge us for that left over. That was a bad service i ever seen."}
{"text":"The food was great! Had a brief discussion and educated the manager on service dog laws--seems they never encountered a service dog before.  We'll likely be regulars!"}
{"text":"So I haven't tried the hot pot portion of the dining experience yet, and have instead partaken in the all you can eat (for 2hrs) sushi and hibachi. All you can eat sounds fantastic, but you don't realize how filing sushi and hibachi actually are until you've ordered and realize you can't possibly eat another round. I ordered two sushi rolls and the chicken and shrimp hibachi and was done. There are a ton of appetizer options (dumplings and such), sushi and sashimi, and different proteins to add to your hibachi. But you better come hungry - like haven't eaten in a full day hungry - in order to prepare yourself, otherwise I feel like you don't really get your $25/meal worth.   My dining partner choose the hot pot, which I would eventually like to try, though it makes me a little nervous to not only choose from all the different options, but to make sure I've properly cooked everything in my selected broth. When I become brave enough, I'll give it a shot.  Either way, the service is attentive and polite. And you are offered oranges or ice cream at the end of your meal, which is nice if you have saved any room for them."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and got both Sushi & Hibachi and the Hot pot. Both were okay.  Sushi and Hibachi at lunch probably is the best deal if you ask me.  Service was great."}
{"text":"A gem! It's clean, has beautiful decor, great ambiance, a large menu, excellent service. The best thing is that the food is delicious and is VERY reasonably priced! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here after picking her up at the airport one Saturday afternoon. She is from Chengdu, Szechuan in China, so she is familiar with hotpot. I am familiar with good food.  The all-you-can-eat tagline will throw you off, even if you've experienced some of the higher end all-you-can-eats in Vegas.  I tend to take notice of how busy a place is, and what kind of a crowd it attracts. For mid-day Saturday, this place was packed, with people waiting to be seated. And my girlfriend commented that about 75% of the customers were Asian.  Hmmmm....  I had the all-you-can eat Sushi, and she had the all-you-can-eat hotpot. And we shared, and we shared, and we shared... Hands down the best hotpot I've ever had, including my girlfriend's traditional Chengdu version, and probably the best Sushi I've ever had.  I got over it many years ago, when foodie-wannabes preaching to me about what food is authentic where, and how you can't have this type or that type of food at such and such a place. Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Great food can be had anywhere, and this is one place where I thought they had great food."}
{"text":"Nice service and very tasty food! The sushi is very nice looking. I like eel sushi and salmon sashimi. Hot pot taste great, the spicy one is not very spicy, but you can ask them to make it more spicy."}
{"text":"I've been to AYCE sushi places all across at this point, and this is definitely one of my favorites.  The reasons the AYCE sushi here is incredible are- -legitimate lobster tempura roll available (not crawfish or anything like that) -cucumber wrapped roll is available -they offer shrimp tempura without vegetables, which is unheard of in plenty of AYCE places -no rice overload -unique rolls to this establishment -high quality sashimi is offered (including actual scallops, not bay scallops) -tempura in rolls is crunchy, fried rolls are actually warm -servers are really friendly and go out of their way to maintain a good relation  Only downside is that service was pretty slow. I ordered two rounds and both took 20-30 minutes, the first was. Cause it was a large order and the second was because one of the rolls took longer to prepare.  Another thing was that the eel wasn't warm but that's not a problem, considering how great everything else was."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch, people are awesome, hot pot is great and the sauce bar is perfect as well."}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised how great this place was for being an \"All You Can Eat\" place. The sushi is very fresh and the rice was perfect. Loved the avocado salad. Service is also great."}
{"text":"Amazing. When coming up to this establishment I thought typical Japanese restaurant and the food would be just \"ok\". Well I was soooooo very wrong. The outside, does this place no justice. Walking in I was blown away. It was clean, very lovely, just all around a beautiful establishment. The people were very friendly and attentive. The gentleman that greeted us was amazing.  This is not a typical Buffet. They give you a menu from which you order the food. if you would like to order more after you are finished with everything that you have previously ordered all you have to do is ask for another paper and the bring it right to you for no extra charge but i believe this is only for the \"sushi all you can eat lunch\". I am not sure if they do this for dinner. Everything that we order was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"It was ok. At $25.99 for all you can eat sushi, and apps, and all that... The sushi was average, nothing amazing. Don't get me wrong, everything we ate was good. It just wasn't \"wow\" for the price. If you can eat a lot then this is for you. If you hardly eat anything, stay home. My son had three orders of hibachi and ate all of them so it was worth it for him. My wife and I had two of the bigger rolls each, and they are plenty big. We also had a bunch of different apps. They only had one flavor of ice cream and it was just a scoop in a cup, no other desserts. I'm definitely super full. Go hungry and get your money's worth. They're pretty liberal about the over ordering penalty, just don't abuse it."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to Kintaro which I wanted to try for a while for my birthday dinner.  It was 5 of us and we were seated right away. The restaurant was moderately filled, but the restaurant itself is huge so it didn't feel crowded.   The server and manager were very pleasant and nice. It was our first time trying Chinese Hot Pot so we had a few questions for the server and she was quite helpful.  They give you a paper menu that you can write what you want / how many you want for the Sushi and a blank piece of paper to write down the numbers of your selection for the hot pot.   We chose Chicken Broth / Chinese Herb for 1 pot and Sha Cha / Chinese Herb for the other.  I've only had the Koreanized version of hot pot / shabu shabu in Korea before so I wasn't sure what to select to put in.. But despite that, the soups turned out quite well. I would totally utilize the sauce station next time and add some more seasoning since some of the soup bases can be a little on the bland side.   The sushi took a bit longer since it was made to order. When the sushi platter arrived, we were really pleasantly surprised at the quality. The sashimi was thick, larger cut and fresh. The nigiri sushi had a good fish to rice ratio and the rice was cooked well. Not too mushy or undercooked. Looking back on it, you can probably get additional soy sauce for dipping at the sauce station but the server was kind enough to get them for us as we weren't aware of it.  All of the rolls ordered were AWESOME. So much better than your usual buffet fare and I'd even go as far as saying it was better than some Japanese restaurants around here.   The hibachi and tempura items were also very good and since some of the guests didn't like raw sushi, it was nice that they had salads, hibachi, fried rice and noodle dishes available in the menu. They even had low-carb options for the sushi and sashimi is always a good option so I wouldn't hesitate to visit even when I go back to my usual low-carb diet.  Ice cream was really good as well, and the bubble tea was delicious too (according to the guest who ordered it. I didn't try it myself).  They give you slices of oranges for dessert at the end.   The server was very attentive, asked if we wanted to order more and we didn't feel like (unlike some other all-you-can-eat made to order places) that we weren't welcome to order more.   Overall,  Food was 5/5  Service was 5/5  Atmosphere was 4.5/5 (The floor was super slippery - I was practically skating on it)   They offer lunch options that are cheaper on Saturdays too, so we're planning on trying that as well. :) Hopefully they keep this up. :D"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a snowing winter night, hoping that hot pot would warm us up. We tried the Sha Cha and Spicy Sichuan-based soup. I think that the soup lacked overall flavor, and I felt like the Sha Cha just had a thick layer of oil from the chili oil. HOWEVER, the cool thing is that you get to share hot pot and sushi in case one person wanted soup and the other wanted sushi! The sushi was good. They have a variety of sashimi, nigiri, and handrolls. I'd have to say that the eel nigiri, seaweed and avocado salad were over the top amazing and my favorite. Despite mediocre soup, I rated them as a five because the food came out fast and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Sitting at the hospital after food poisoning from Kinyaro. We ate there Thursday, admitted Friday and just getting discharged. My son had a great experience with the sushi (the reason we went), but my friend and I had the steak fried rice which made us both sick. It was the only place we ate together in the prior month. Service was just adequate. A little too much hovering and warning about waste, which I guess is a problem, but not one we had with my 18 year old son. The shrimp and chicken in my hibachi was somewhat chewy and overcooked. Nice decor. Wouldn't eat anything but sushi there."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the restaurant. The main future is certainly the expansive menu that surpasses the other sushi houses I have experienced. They have their special rolls that are in the names of Vehicle makes. I tried the BMW and Mercedes; outstanding flavor and was served quickly. The presentation was on spot. I wanted to try the lot of everything; as good as it is; I cannot afford $26 pp all you can eat that frequently. That being said it is worth the price. I ordered chicken tampora; teriyaki chicken; sweet potato roll, chicken roll, California Roll, Noodles, Edamame; and Chicken steak Hibachi. The hibachi was cooked to a great taste, serving size was incredibly fair; not too large as so you cannot enjoy anything else as Toko in Streetsboro/Kent really loads up on the fried rice (not that I am upset about a large serving). The hibachi does not cost extra either and is included in the buffet and is unlimited.  The sushi was very good; considerable to finer sushi houses I have been to around the country. There were 6 pieces to each roll and they were a little larger than I am used to which is also a plus to me. So many options that trying it all in a few trips would be a challenge.  The setting at Ridge Park Square at the old Hong Kong buffet is an interesting choice; however they have renovated the entire interior and it is stunning. I do want to try the hot pot in the near future. I went on a Wednesday and it was not that busy. However I am attributing that to it being a Wednesday and I was told during the weekend there could be a wait up to an hour which is really good to hear since this needs to stick around. The service was from an obvious trainee so it was okay but I got served by the manager more than the actual server; its not a big deal and they were not afraid to ask if you wanted more which was welcoming since you did not feel rushed. I will add some pictures I took to accompany this review. I cannot recommend this location more and here's to great success from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not recommending this place for hot pot buffet. They don't have a lot to choose from the menu. There was no tofu rap, no lamb, no shrimp. We ordered squid but never got it. The fatty beef wasn't so fatty. The only good thing about it is the sause bar. I will not be returning to this place. Hope that helps."}
{"text":"I have been twice for lunch hotpot and dinner sushi.  Lunch hotpot: I loved it so much we went back just a few days later. There is so much variety and everything was super fresh. The broth were well seasoned and flavored. The make your own sauce is really what packs the flavor in. Our service both times was attentive and friendly. I crave this now!  Dinner sushi: higher moderate quality but def quantity. Lots of variety between rolls, sashimi, nigiri, apps, soups, noodles and much more. Make sure you can eat what you order to avoid the up charge! Totally understandable and they are very upfront about it. Service was not as good as during hot pot...we struggled to get drink refills."}
{"text":"Who can deny the paradise of sushi and hot pot? Kintaro have all I wanted in one place. I think they opened not too long ago, and transform from a Chinese buffet restaurant. As we walk in the restaurant, we are greeted by the manager and asked us do we want sushi or hot pot. We opted in for the hot pot. For both sushi and hot pot, they do have the option for regular dinning or AYCE option.  For ordering, they provided a sheet of colorful menu, along the little note pad and a pen. All you need to do is to mark the number on the note pad. As for the broth option, you can either do an individual little pot for one pot, or get a bigger pot for two broth. Food came out fairly fast and I love they put the food in a ginormous plate. That way, there can be extra room on the table. As for the dipping sauce, you will head up to the sauce bar. And self-serve yourself with 10+ sauce and condiment to go with your food.  Even though I didn't have a chance to try their sushi, I'm in love with Kintaro already. I wish they will open one in Columbus. Food is good and service is attentive. What can I ask for more in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and tried the all you can eat sushi. Overall, it's just very average sushi but it's worth it for the price. If you do the lunch buffet, the sashimi isn't included. The place is large and you can also do an all you can eat hot pot.  For the AYCE sushi, they give you a menu and you check off what you want. They have a good selection of appetizers, nigiri, hand rolls, special rolls, tempura, teriyaki, hibachi, etc. It took a while for the sushi to come out. They were all consistently sized, which is good. Salmon and eel are always my go to. However, the rice was dry. Again, average quality sushi, but can't complain because of the price. Overall, the food is what you expect from a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I was impressed by the wide range of selections on the dinner hot pot menu. Great options for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"$25 for all you can eat sushi or hotpot?!  Yes please!  I've been wanting to come here for a while now after seeing all the great yelp reviews, and man I'm glad I did!  First off it's about a 5-6 mile drive from downtown, but I don't mind I have a car.  When arriving we were greeted by a very nice gentleman and seated right away.  We decided to go with the all you can eat sushi even though I was torn because I love hotpot too.  The waitress handed us the menu and explained we could order whatever we wanted, but try not to order too much or you could be charged extra for taking leftovers home.  The menu had a great selection!  You don't just get all you can eat sushi either...the options also included soups, salads, appetizers, hibachi, tempura, noodles, fried rice, teriyaki and ice cream!  Omg how to choose?  We ordered the edename appetizer and several sushi rolls to share.  Wow I was surprised with the quality and freshness of the sushi!  Definitely the best I have had since moving to Cleveland!  I was also impressed with the presentation as everything we ordered looked beautiful.    To sum things up I definitely got my $25 dollars worth of food here!  I asked my husband to roll or carry me to the car, but he wouldn't lol. Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm craving sushi again!  Next time I come though I'm going to try the all you can eat hotpot :)"}
{"text":"Still agree with my previous review, but since then they removed the $11 lunch hour special and implemented a $15 all you can hot pot, which for me is not as good of a deal.  I got plenty full at $11 and am bummed that they took off those delicious little sausages.  Still love their fish though.  I'll still come but not as often- $15 is a pretty fair chunk of change and I don't like having to force myself to eat just to feel like I'm getting a reasonable deal.  Especially if they reserve the right to charge $12 a pound for uneaten food."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and was surprised to find such an all you can eat restaurant near where I stayed. We came in around 9:30pm and was quickly seated. They have the options of all you can eat sushi/sashimi and all you can eat hotpot. They even allow your group members to choose different options so that you can share. Between the 5 of us, we got 3 ayce hotpot and 2 ayce sushi. The servers are friendly and our orders came out in about 10-15min after ordering. They have a sauce station where you can mix your own dipping sauces for the hotpot. The hotpot meat comes frozen but it was still good. My favorite meats were the beef and lamb, pork was too chewy for me. The sushi rolls were good and sashimi was fresh. Great place to stop by if you're ever in the mood for hotpot/ sushi. While we were leaving, we saw a party of 3 came in close to their closing time but they were promptly seated and served. Great food and service! And there's plenty of parking in the lot. Definitely will come again if I'm in town again in the future."}
{"text":"i tried both the Hot Pot and Chicken Teriyaki.   Hotpot's ok. DO NOT CHOOSE the spicy soup though, they are VERY VERY VERY spicy.. i always get the Sa-cha soup, its not too salty or bland and my friends like it.   Chicken Teriyaki, just ok. I give it 3 stars because they need to work on making the chicken softer, i like my meat soft. The taste... well, you can make the the taste stronger, its too bland. Probably add more sauce like Hoisin or Oyster just sayin. I took my left overs home and thats what i did and tasted better. Also, the long grain rice used.. wasnt sure if it was undercook or its just the quality. In my opinion, i like eating the regular Japanese rice just cause they're fluffier and softer or Jasmine rice are ok too.   The restaurant itself, i like the ambiance. Place is clean since theyre brand new. Not too bad for date nights. I would go back here again to try the unlimited sushi next time."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate marriage of quality and quantity. The ingredients are super fresh. The Sushi is amazing. I also give high marks for presentation and quality. Bottom line as a sushi restaurant Kintaro over matches everywhere in northeast Ohio. Then, there is hotpot... who would think to look in northeast Ohio for Chinese Hot pot! It is all you can eat as well.  Jay the manager and Cora whom is frequently our server go above and beyond to make every visit here special... as such I am in often"}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat sushi deal is lots of fun for a group! Lunch is an especially good value as it is a $14.99 vs. $25.99 for dinner. There is a good selection of both traditional and Americanized/specialty rolls. The menu for the ayce sushi also includes tempura, appetizers, teriyaki, fried rice, etc. I think the only difference between the lunch and dinner menus is that lunch does not include sashimi (both include nigiri)."}
{"text":"I did not think I'd see then day when I'd visit an AYCE sushi place. Well, today was that day.  My takes-   The decor: Much nicer than expected. Place seemed clean. Very spacious. Decent looking bar right through the main entrance.  The service: Fast and friendly. No complaints.  The price: $15 for lunch for all you can eat for sushi and other common Japanese food is a good value for most (great, if you can eat many rolls).  The food: Overall, the sushi was ok. There was nothing wrong with it, but it's just decent. Very similar in quality to the normal suburban strip mall joints. I do like that it is made to order and not just stilling on a buffet table. The tuna/avo hand roll was the best item I tried. The tempura shrimp was bland and overly battered. The other kitchen items brought past me to other tables looked very mediocre.  Would I go back?: To try the hot pot, yes. For sushi, I *might*, but would rather hit up Umi or Mizu, if in the area and given a choice."}
{"text":"This dinner was my first experience with hot pot and it was great, mostly because of our server who spent the time explaining everything about it. She was patient and funny with her answers to our hundreds of questions.  Our group got the all-you-can-eat hot pot and sushi.  And we ate a lot.  I stuck to the hot pot getting various menu items to create an endless combination of bowls.  Our server even created us sauces from a mixture of flavors from the sauce bar.  I washed this all down with a fantastic bubble tea. I thought I ate all I could eat and then the server asked if I wanted ice cream and for some unknown reason I had to have it too. I have never felt so full - it was kinda awesome and gross."}
{"text":"It worth BIG ZERO. We have had a horrible experience! Very very bad quality of food including beef, fish and soup broth! Everything was tasteless. When we complained to the manager he ignored us and answered a phone call !!!! They asked us for an extra charge for the \" waste food\" because we didn't eat that horrible food!! In our way out that same unprofessional manger ran towards us because he thought we didn't pay!!!!! Seriously!"}
{"text":"This is the only authentic Chinese hot pot restaurant that I am aware of in the area. It tasted just like the hot pot I grew up with and the selection is incredible. All of our food was fresh, and there is a good selection of seafood, meat etc. for the 24.99 buffet price. I would recommend going for lunch unless you can really eat a lot, as the 7 items included for lunch is about as much as I can eat anyway. The Sichuan broth is great! Chicken broth was a bit bland. There's also a little make-your-own sauce bar that I appreciated. We also had a beautiful sushi boat because my father accidentally ordered too many rolls. The sashimi was fresh and delicious. Wasn't as big of a fan of the rolls. No limit on sashimi, so you can really get your money's worth depending on what you order. I would highly recommend kintaro as a hot pot restaurant. I read a review in which someone got sick from hot pot. You have to be careful to avoid cross-contamination as you are cooking raw food at the table. Food-borne illness is a risk, but that's not the fault of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best hot pot restaurant in Midwest. It's exceptionally clean inside with great service, fresh meat and veggies, friendly service, and a fancy/brightly lit decor. Your table can do both unlimited hot pot and unlimited sushi for just $1 extra per person which I would recommend!"}
{"text":"If you ever want to indulge, I highly suggest coming here for the lunch buffet! They offer both hot pot and sushi all you can eat deals for $15 (lunch). Dinner moves up to about $25/pp.   Both hot pot and sushi are good options and worth the buffet price. Sushi is not bad for midwestern buffet quality fish. They definitely put in effort with the rolls and nigiri. The rolls have a good balance of rice, fish and other - very important!  We went the weekend of Lunar New Year at around 1:15 and had a 40 min wait time. It's packed on the weekends so be prepared to wait, especially on holidays. Most other times, you can get seating pretty easily.  The place itself is classically Chinese in its over the top fanciness, gold and neon LED lighting. It looks nice and clean though.   Be careful not to overeat because they'll charge you for leftovers!"}
{"text":"I went here expecting the prior business at this location, a mediocre Asian buffet. What a fabulous surprise to find all you can eat sushi for a very good price for lunch! The beverage is separate but there is miso soup and other apps included. The guys next to me kind of overdid it and shared with the rest of us so they did not have to pay for waste. Everything I had was good! And they make their own dumplings which is a real plus for me!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Good, authentic Chinese hot pot. Definitely hits the spot for those cravings. The lunch special is definitely the way to go. More than enough food."}
{"text":"Can't beat all you can eat sushi for $15.  The sushi and hot pot here is great along with the friendly waiters and waitresses.  It's a very comfortable environment and is a great place to go for anyone craving good sushi.  I have found my new AYCE sushi spot in Ohio!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I did the all you can eat hot pot and my husband did the all you can eat sushi. I am stuff and happy for life right now. The staff was super friendly (Jenna was a great server) and the food was came out fast and fresh!!! Will definitely be back here again soon."}
{"text":"Service is wonderful. Interior design is pretty modern and eye catching with the bright blue lights and all.   Hot Pot - I've tried three times in total and had horrible experiences every time. Honestly, I just don't think hot pot is for me since everyone else enjoys their experience. You get the menu and write down your items and soon they'll bring you a pot with your choice of broth (either individual or shared amongst friends). It takes only a couple minutes to warm up the broth and soon your choice of ingredients will come out for you to add to your broth. They also have a bar with different sauces and little ingredients (lime, lemon, eggs, parsley, etc.) that you are free to use however you so choose.   It is all you can eat and there are more options during dinner, which of course will cost more. This also applies to sushi.   Sushi - it's more about quantity rather than quality. If you're searching for quality of taste, this is not the place for you. It will taste like what it is meant to be, but nothing noteworthy. After all, it is all you can eat. They also provide hibachi, udon, rice bowls along with other food options you may choose from.   I cannot wait to return and eat all the sushi my tummy can take! See you guys soon. (:"}
{"text":"Good sushi (especially for an all you can eat place!) and good hot pot as well. It's a fun place to go to with a group of friends."}
{"text":"We love this place.  They have hibachi that they make for you, hot pot, and sushi items.  Very good menu and large menu!  They have all you can eat or you can order from the menu.  Very nice decor inside and Jay the manager is very nice!  It's our new fav place to eat."}
{"text":"Unlimited sushi was pretty good , service was great - especially for a party of 12 people."}
{"text":"Went here today and had a great experience! YOU CAN SHARE ALL YOU CAN EAT HOT POT AND SUSHI WITH A FEIEND!!!! The waitress was wonderful and patient with us.(first timers). The food is great as is the service. The only reason I give 4 stars is because the menu and how everything works is a bit confusing. Theres a rule about being charged for waste (which I think is cool). But its not really clear as to when they can charge you for waste. Awesome place and I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. My best friend and I both did the all you can eat sushi and hibachi. Everything was fantastic. Our server, I think his name was Ben, was absolutely wonderful. Would totally go again."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the great server I had.. I went for lunch this past Saturday after reading all of these great reviews.. I must be missing something here because my lunch was below average. Thank god I didn't spend any more than $14.99. Miso soup average. Tempura shrimp soggy, cold made with undercooked panko breadcrumbs. Seaweed salad basic. Shrimp hibachi decent. Kintaro roll served room temperature was an automatic turnoff. It was just gross, but my server told me unless I ate some of it, I would be charged a food waste fee? I gagged a few pieces down but will never return!"}
{"text":"Hot diggity pot! This lunchtime meal was worth the trek out to Brooklyn from Cleveland Heights. Kintaro was much more suave than I was expecting from outside appearances, with modern stone finishes and ambient lighting. Even the bathrooms were clean, spacious, and freshly perfumed. A little overboard on the cheesy \"Chinese\" decorations, but hey, they've got to sell their niche, I suppose.   The entire space is separated into two dining areas and a sushi bar, with hot pot tables of varying sizes at the far end. These special stone-top tables have built-in conductive heaters - meaning that they'll heat only the pot and will feel cool to the touch. This sorcery does not extend to the pot and soup itself though, so don't be deceived and be sure to blow on your food before eating it! You can control the boiling intensity using the dials on the side of the table, or directly on the table for communal stovetops.  We were a little confused by the hot pot pricing, but here's what it boiled (hehe) down to: $25 all-you-can-eat (AYCE), all day, or $10.99 for the lunch special, which gives you a choice of soup base + 7 menu items (with no duplicates, so no double fatty beef, and noodles do count as 1 item). We were given little slips of paper to write down our orders for the lunchtime special, and then in short order our pots of soup base came out and were set in our individual inlaid stovetops. The ladles were long enough so that they wouldn't drown in the pots when left alone - hurrah! We got up to fill up on sauces at the self-serve station. There's a solid selection of traditional spices used, feel free to mix and match in different bowls! TIP: I also got a separate bowl of green onion and cilantro to throw into my soup, and some lemons for my water.   In not so short order (probably 20 minutes later, as they brought out all our party's orders at once), we were presented with individual plates of the raw hot pot items. To our very pleasant surprise, the meat/fish balls were handmade in-house! Instant credibility boost. The slices of meat were also very high quality, perfectly fatty and not too thin or frozen like some other CA Bay Area chains I've been to. Each of the 7 items was given in ample quantity and I believe for most people the lunchtime deal would leave you satisfyingly sated. Few in our party would have been able to eat more than 2x this quantity to get to make the AYCE deal worth it.   Besides the actual delivery of food, the staff kept busy refilling our water glasses and restocking the soup broth, which is my main sticking point at hot pot places. So good on them! Even though it was pretty busy as a Saturday midday, we felt everything was in reasonable order and had a satisfying diner experience.   Our sole mission here was to consume Chinese-style hot pot, so we didn't touch the sushi. From other friends who did taste it, the verdict was \"decent\". What would you expect for AYCE though?"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Good quality veggies and protein for hot pot and the sushi was fantastic."}
{"text":"The sushi CAN be fresher. I felt like the sushi ingredients were from Costco and the raw fish had a freezer taste. They have a 10.99/lb food waste fee, so if you go, order small & many times rather than once and a whole lot. The waitress Vivian was super duper nice- I wish I had more tip $$. Otherwise, I came out of the restaurant REEKING of fried Asian food. I came home and changed myself and kids since we STUNK like fried food. Gross. The restaurant was clean, but I would prefer paper napkins over cloth any day. The menu is not really kid friendly. The food was good. Some of the sushi was just plain gross- I didn't like the ingredients. Will stick to Philadelphia roll. The hostess was rude but smiled. He had us waiting 15 minutes for a table when clearly more than 1/2 the restaurant was EMPTY. May or may not come back.... who knows."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat hot pot and sushi place I have ever been to! Lunch buffet is only $14.99 for either sushi or hot pot but if you come in with more than one person, you can choose one or the other so you can have both! The staff actually encourage you to do that. I will start with the hot pot - if you love hot pot because of the meat, this may not be your best option. In my opinion, the chicken, pork and beef meats are not the best quality. The beef slices contain too much fat for me. However, anything else such as the vegetables, fish balls, tofu, clams, squid, noodles, etc are delicious!! As for the all you can eat sushi, the menu has a very large variety of options for good quality sushi!! My favorite rolls are the Hond and Audi rolls. I will definitely be back to this place! Come hungry, NOMZ."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I didn't have high hopes. Now, it's definitely one of my favorite sushi places in the area. They have a fairly extensive menu and I've never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"I found myself hungry and with time to spare around lunchtime a few weeks ago, and decided to satisfy a sushi craving at Kintaro.  They have an all-you-can-eat deal for $15 that seemed to good to be true, but I can't eat THAT much sushi anyway, so I went with the three rolls for $10 combo.  The spicy tuna wasn't very good, with a weird texture and not much heat.  However, I enjoyed the yellowtail avocado roll and the shrimp tempura roll was delicious.  I realized after the fact that I should have also received a soup, so I can't tell you what that's like.  The restaurant was clean, service was a bit slow but very polite, and prices are obviously excellent.  I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Kintaro, but I wouldn't say no if I was in the area more often."}
{"text":"Very good, fresh food and very affordable prices. The all you can sushi dinner is a very good deal. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The BEST place to get hot pot (or shabu) in Cleveland. You can do family style or your own pot, and it's all-you-can-eat. The options for hot pot are more extensive at night, and I would recommend going for dinner.   If you've never done hot pot before, I would go with someone who has, preferably someone Chinese. I can understand how it wouldn't necessarily impress you if you don't know how to mix the sauces, or pick out only \"safe\" meats and veggies, or if you overcook the hot pot. This place is legit - no further evidence is needed than all the hoards of Asians at the hot pot tables.  (PS) My husband did their all you can eat sushi. It was good, but to me, sushi isn't what makes this place special."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????6?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Such a good first time experience.  The restaurant was beautifully decorated, staff was wonderful, food was fresh and delicious.  I hope the location doesn't deter people from coming, because it's definitely worth the drive, and it's right off of 480 on Ridge Road.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time since it was last a buffet i dont eat sushi so i was hesitate to eat here but glad i did there rice i know is the best rice ive had out of ever chineese resturant ive ever at the inside looks really nice alot better scenery from the previous owner if you go here defenitly try the rice i promise its good"}
{"text":"Made to order buffet.  The food is amazing.  Will definitely frequent this place.  The Nissan Roll and unagi is fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Jeep roll and it was awesome. I would highly recommend this place to all my sushi lovers. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi spot!! Can be a little pricey around dinner but it's well worth it!! I haven't tried the hot pot but i am looking forward to trying it soon!!!"}
{"text":"Walk in and get good quality sushi fresh made (not buffet) all you can eat for $26! At first we were skeptical about the quality having been to many sub-par all you can eat sushi places but I have to say Kintaro definitely impressed me.   Service staff was consistent, friendly, and attentive.   Sushi was good quality, fresh, and the correct temperature.   Selection of fish, appetizers, and non-sushi items is great for those who aren't avid sushi eaters.   We now choose this sushi restaurant over others because this restaurant is cost effective and good quality."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever have. We waited over a half hour during lunch for chicken nuggets and fries for my toddler, an additional 30 minutes for our sushi, which was missing items, and my sister waited 20 minutes for a drink I had to remind our server she ordered. When we asked for a manager and our check, we were told it was an additional $15 for our food waste. As someone in restaurant management, I am appalled by the service and will never return."}
{"text":"Finally a place that gets sushi correct! Portions are not the idiotic American size.  Miso soup was excellent, as was shumai. Scallop sashimi was perfect, as the raw scallop had an almost floral note to it. Mini Cooper, Lincoln, and Tesla rolls were the perfect balance of flavors.   Only complaints: too much rice with the beef teriyaki (which was very good), and the hot tea was too watery.  As noted, they will charge $11/lb for food waste, and I 100% support this, from experience of ayce places where food is wasted with little regard to the fact that some people have no food to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I were hungry and found this place.  They have two all-you-can-gorge options:  sushi or hot pot.  One catch - if you don't eat everything you ordered they can charge you back a fee; that spooked us but we went for it anyway.  It's not cheap!  $25 per person.  But the menu was quite extensive and varied to include appetizers like edamame, and main courses like teppanyaki, tempura and ramen - same wastage rule applied.  The food was excellent.  Hubby especially liked the shrimp teppanyaki which included grilled vegetables and rice but was a small, modest portion and size.   We were advised to order a little bit at a time, which was helpful to gauge how much we could really eat.    We ordered three rolls and they were all delicious.  Near the end we ordered the beef teppanyaki under the assumption it would be the same portion size as the shrimp teppanyaki but, it wasn't!  It was nearly double the size than the shrimp!  We didn't know if this was intentionally done to zap us on that wastage fee but hubby was determined to finish everything including every grain of rice.  To boot he threw in a bowl of ice cream for dessert, which the only flavor they had was butter pecan - none for me thanks.  We ate plenty but I had that nagging feeling we should have ordered individual menu items instead of the $25/pp.  I didn't figure out the math, but we probably would have come close to that with everything we ordered.  Hubby recommends this as an occasional nice place out.  We both recommend trying the AYCG lunch menu, which they told us was about half of the menu items but also much more reasonably priced at around $12/pp.  The hitch there is they only offer that M-Th."}
{"text":"Great value, great food, but not a 5.  Overall 4 The value is 5 Quality of food 3.5 (ranged from 2.5-4.5) Service 4.7 Aesthetic 4.2  Tip: don't get the strawberry ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"Kintaro Sushi & Hot Pot is an interesting place with quite a bit of potential.  A free standing building in front of Lowes, you would never know that this was recently a Chinese Buffet; they have remodeled the place to look very Asian modern, lots of browns and tans with tiles.  The overall effect is upscale and cool with a nice bit of class.    While Kintaro has several all you can eat options, it is not a buffet, rather you are served at your table.  I've tried Kintaro several times for the weekday lunch $14.99 all you can eat Sushi and Hibachi.  You are given a single page menu which you check off what you want.  There are a couple of limitations: you eat all of what you order; they will not modify any items and they will limit how much you get at a single time.  I tried a bunch of apps and other hot items, including the teriaki squid, the hibachi shrimp, the spring rolls, shumei and fried squid app.   The Shumei and squid app were both nice and relatively small, nothing special, but nice and the right size so that you are not filled up.  The Teriaki Squid was a larger portion of squid with peppers, onions and brocolli in a decent sauce; the portion size was a bit too big for this type of dining, it will limit how many other items you can try.   The Hibachi  shrimp was a more reasonable size, with a side of fried rice and a nice creamy sauce.  Overall the hot foods are good and well made, but nothing really special.  I have tried quite a number of the sushi items, Nigiri, small rolls and larger rolls.  The sushi menu has actually expanded a bit with them adding a number of items including more types of nigiri sushi.  The sushi was better then the buffets, not as good as the fine Sushi places around town, but good.  The rice to fish ratio is ok, I would prefer a bit less rice but I understand why it probably will not change.  The fish that is used is of good quality.   I was more impressed with the nigiri sushi which tends to showcase the quality of the fish being served, with the Tuna, White Tuna and Smoke Salmon all being very good.  The regular rolls are good, although I would wish that the spicy rolls were a bit spicier.   The large rolls are interesting, but tend towards using tempura frying and sauces to add flavors, rather then letting the flavors of the fish come through.      During my first visit, I had a big issue with service, which was extremely slow, a huge problem when you are doing all you can eat table service.  In addition I did not get all of the items that I ordered each time.  I did talk to the manager who told me that they were short of servers , but even so I was sadly disappointed with the server I had.   On the later trips, they seem to have resolved these issues, with service being much better, with food coming out in a more timely manner.  I also limited the number of items I ordered at a single time so there was no issue with with missing items.  A couple of other notes, all beverages are an additional charge, there are a number of other options available from the all you can eat menu.  There are hot pot options at lunch and dinner.  The sushi options have grown, you will not find anything very exotic here such as soft shell crabs, uni, scallops and the like, which I would love for them to add, but those are expensive items so I understand why they are not on the menu.  The improvements in service, have made Kintaro an excellent option for all you can eat sushi, especially at lunch when you have plenty of time.  Although not cheap you get high quality sushi and other Asian cuisine with good variety.   I have also heard that the hotpot option is very popular, so I will have to give that a try."}
{"text":"Sat here for well over 15 minutes without a single person coming over. Finally got up and left. I've eaten here several times before and it's decent for all u can eat sushi at $15 before 3pm but service has always been slow. This was enough for me and when I approached the manager at hostess stand to explain I've been sitting there and no one came over.....he said nothing. Just stared at me. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Service: 3/5 Average service. You may wait for your drink but it doesn't soil the experience. Unless you are impatient (not a bad thing), then don't come here.  Food quality: 7/10 Szechuan hot pot is actually spicy and the sushi has been very good and extremely consistent between visits. But there is no option for higher quality tunas or specialty options. If you want a uber high quality sushi place, this isn't it. The hot pot varrity is good and veggies are fresh.   Extras: 5/5 The have a  variety of sauses for your hot pot and decent drink selection, But the lunch pricing is 15$ for unlimited sushi.  Overall: 15/20 A Safe environment to Gorge yourself and a good place for safe sushi. Also, the price cannot be beat."}
{"text":"I was skeptical driving up. I thought we where at a Ryan Steak  House. When we went inside it was a little overwhelming. It is a big place that has many options. Once we settled in and figured out what we wanted it took minutes for them to set it up. The food is fresh and plentiful.  The bar is lacking selection. We split a sushi and hot pot. OMG it was incredible authentic and priced reasonably.  It is my new place to go. $25 a person is so worth it. I hope they get more liquors in the future. This is a solid 4.5 stars. It would be a 5 if the bar was better."}
{"text":"The sushi and hibachi here is DELICIOUS. You cannot beat this price either! You get actual service-to and from your table-not the buffet style where anyone can sneeze all over your dinner & etc. the sushi is in normal portions and truly unlimited for 2 hours, the lobster is actual lobster and the ginger dressing tastes housemade and is so good. There is only one catch to the all you can eat 2 hours-if you have excessive food waste they will charge you $10.99/lbs for EXCESSIVE food waste. Example: you order one of everything and you eat 1/4 of your order, you will be charged $10.99 per pound for everything you didn't eat. If you leave a few bites/a reasonable amount behind you won't be charged. You can't take anything home if it is from the all you can eat buffet either. And depending on what you are ordering you may be better off just ordering off the regular menu (i.e. If all you want is hibachi and want to take your left-overs home). I will be going back here again in the near future!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved our experience at Kintaro. They let him do the ayce sushi and I did the ayce hot pot. The best part was that they let us share with each other. The waitress was very patient, helpful, and considerate and brought food out quickly. They let you modify the size of orders if you are concerned you won't able to eat it all. ingredients were fresh, the selection was amazing, food was delicious, and i would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I really love Kintaro! This is my first yelp review in years. The price is amazing for such an extensive menu. Great for a big group. I usually opt for the AYCE sushi option but the hotpot menu is good too. However, I would prefer more flavors for the actual broth. For the sushi, the quality is great and the taste is even better. I highly recommend (at least try it once, you won't regret it)!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited Kintaro three times for lunch, and it has been a good experience each time.  When you walk in, the host will ask if you've been there before, and I believe this drives your service assignment because the first visit was the best as far as service went.  The second time, the server was a bit lazy and I had to go hunting in order to get some forks, and the check, for example.  The third time, the young lady assigned to us was very sweet but (1) did not bring any kind of plate to rest hot pot ladles on, (2) provided nothing to put empty clam shells in, and (3) looked at me like I was the man in the moon when I asked for a soup bowl.  Seeing as a common way to end a hot pot meal is to cook your noodles and eat them with your broth, as a soup, this was not an unreasonable request.  Also, I had made the rookie error of forgetting to break up my ramen noodles before cooking them, so I needed some extra help.  She did eventually bring a small bowl, at least bigger than the little condiment bowls that were initially offered.  Let me reassure you that fear of average service is no reason to stay away from Kintaro.  It is an amazing place.  If you are new to hot pot, read up a little about how it is done, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.  This being my third hot pot meal, I was much more relaxed than earlier visits.  I went with Szechuan broth today, because I love spicy Asian food, and with all seafood and low carb vegetables in order to minimize the toll on my post-holiday diet.  I had fish filets, cilantro balls (which are fish based), marvelous little clams, squid, a bunch of cilantro (which was great with this broth as a soup green), bean sprouts, Enoki mushrooms, black mushrooms, and ramen noodles.  I wish that they would put udon noodles on the lunch menu.  While waiting for the food to arrive, I made my own sauce of sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, and green onions.  I also got some Kintaro sauce, which was great and would work as an only condiment.  I did much better at managing my broth this time than earlier visits, just kicking up the heat a little when adding food, then reducing to a simmer as soon as it started boiling.  I didn't have to have any liquid added, which helped maintain the flavor of my broth.  My sushi-eating wife loved the fish filets (as did I) and helped me with them, and I helped her with her sushi.  Sharing is much of the fun.  So I ordered more filets, along with Fuchow fish balls.  I found the Fuchow fish balls a little tough, which may have been operator error on my part.  I preferred the cilantro balls and the homemade fish balls, which I have had on other visits.  Some of the clams had full digestive tracts and so were a bit gritty.  This is not really a complaint as some people like them that way, a la A. Zimmern.  Just an FYI.  After eating everything but a smattering of vegetables, I made a soup of them with the noodles and some of the broth, which was delicious.  I felt like I got good value at $14.99 for lunch, and I feel that $24.99 would be okay for dinner with the expanded menu.  So, a slight downgrade for service, which I think is management's best opportunity to improve the business.  Kintaro is a must-visit if you love Asian food!  I went on about hot pot but the sushi and hibachi choices are very good as well."}
{"text":"First time going was for lunch. The place is beautiful inside. I also love the condiment bar! Everything was delisch! We had some different sushi rolls, chicken hibachi, tempura mushrooms, soup, spring rolls, ice cream. The spring rolls are just ok, will pass on those next time. Our sever/waitress, Cindy, was great. Very friendly and helpful with ordering! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"5 stars just for the hot pot buffet. I did not try the sushi buffet. Even tag also seems fresh and attractive.  I'm here just for business trip. Cannot find any other place around to have hotpot. Especially hot pot buffet of this style.  Parking is in the plaza free.  Cannot beat little sheep Mongolian hot pot but this place service is good the soup base is good. The spicy base tastes good. The vegetables are pretty fresh. Lamb taste awesome. You can tell that by your meat lovers' eyes. The big clam is off my selection next time. Watercress is so fresh! Also all the other vegetables!   One bad thing is they don't carry even couples of fruits..... just orange... hopefully they would have watermelon in the future! I did not taste the ice cream since after having such gravy food, it's quite unhealthy to eat anything so cold. Bad for your stomach and your digestion system!"}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi place I've been to. They give SASHIMI on the dinner menu. The sashimi pieces are smaller so just multiply your servings by 2! A lot of their specialty rolls have cream cheese so be careful. Too much of that can really do you in. The appetizers are good, so is the salmon teriyaki."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the quality of the food, the all you can eat dinner price at first appears steep but after seeing how much high quality variety was offered I was content with the price.  The plating/presentation of the sushi was fantastic.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This an interesting place to eat. I like the all you can eat on sushi, hibachi and hot pot. The dinner price may be a bit but worth the experience. Some don't like the wasted food policy, but I understand it. Seems to lack depth in flavor, but I don't know if that's a cultural thing"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious--what more could you ask for? We don't get the overly fancy rolls so we order off the menu. This is one of our local go-tos."}
{"text":"Fantastic price and amazing food! We always order off the menu, as it's significantly cheaper than the all-you-can-eat. Unless of course you are ordering a lot of the higher priced rolls."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with a friend and we got the hot pot.  Food We chose to get a large hot pot with two broths - one side was the Chinese Herb and the other the Sha Cha Soup Broth. It's a bit hard to describe the taste of Sha Cha but it's savory. Note, it does look like you can get individual pots if you don't want to do a large communal one.  We then proceeded to get double the meat - the fatty beef and the pork slices. We also got double the Fuchow fish balls and the Homemade fish balls. One has a a filling, I believe it's the Fuchow, and I much preferred that one. We also got chinese cabbage, all of the mushrooms, fried tofu, cilantro, tofu skin, potatoes, watercress, rice noodles and potato vermicelli. I thought the amoung of meat didn't seem to be much but when eating everything you definitely don't feel hungry. But if you're a big meat eater you may have to order more.   Helpful Tips -Wait for the pot to boil. -Put in the things that cook longer (ex: potatoes, melon, corn, etc.) and also put in the mushrooms - that'll give the broth extra flavor. -There's a sauce station where you can make your own sauce mix - don't be scared to experiment, it can turn out delicious! I did that for one of my sauces. The other I stuck with the pretty traditional sauce combo - sesame mixed with the chives mixture (it looks kind of gross but I promise it's delicious). I departed a bit from the basic mixture by adding garlic because you can't go wrong with garlic. -They have raw eggs at the sauce station as well - they're delicious in the hot pot! Put them in to get them hardboiled, crack them into a spoon and poach them. I'm partial to poaching them since you get the flavor of the broth as well!  Overall Thoughts I'd give this place a 4.5. The only reason it's not a 5 is that I wish their meat selection was larger - different cuts, some innards, etc. I definitely recommend this for lunch with friends but it's definitely not something to rush through. If you only have an hour - I'd say come back when you have a bit more time. The service was fast but you're cooking this yourself and you can only cook and eat so fast. The place was very clean and well decorated. I also think I'd strictly come here for lunch, $14.99 is a great price for everything you get but the dinner price seems to be a bit expensive unless the selection is a lot bigger and there's dinner-specific food you want to try."}
{"text":"We did all you can eat sushi at lunch and it was amazing !!! Coming from Cali it's hard o find good sushi out here. Definitely impressed and will be back again soon"}
{"text":"If you are a black don't even try to get a job here. Unprofessional, rude and just plain mean.  I was hired here as a server.  I was told by multiple employees that if the owner was the one who interviewed me(a stand in manager did my hiring process) i wouldnt even have been given an application because they \"dont hire black people\". Once I completed training I was told I was going to be called with my schedule, weeks pass and I never get a call so call them they told me they \"hired too many people but  would be called so I could be a busser each weekend\" , again I was never called so I just gave up.  I went here to eat a couple times and there were no new servers only the bus boy who they moved up to be a server. Horrible service I was treated unfairly as an employee and a customer."}
{"text":"Really fun spot for groups. Unfortunately, recent visits have included cold tempura rolls and less fresh tasting crab and other fish. Worse, when I didn't want to eat the sub-par rolls, I was charged the fee for failing to finish my order. They were very nice about it, but I didn't feel good about paying extra because the food was poor. I'm sad to post this, because I had been here several times and enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"We experienced a slight panic when we first sat down, trying to figure out the best way to order. To help you effortlessly glide through the whole hot-pot experience, here's how:  1. Come during week days lunch time     On weekends it is reported having to wait for 1 hour to get a seat.  2. Get the $11 per person hot pot option.      You can get sushi anywhere else. You'll only get to experience fun hot pot experience here. in Cleveland area.  3. Pick individual hot pot, or communal big pot      Individual pot: you cook your own, eat your own ingredients. Not sharing with dining partners. Communal big pot: aka family style. Your dining partners and yourself will collectively cook all your ingredients in the hot iron plate in the middle of the table, and share food.  4. Eat person gets to pick 7 ingredients from the photo gallery menu      All ingredients come with pictures. No guess work here. I recommend seafood over meat, because you almost force them to present you with fresh seafood. The pre sliced meat however are all frozen...feels like frozen, packaged bulk meat you get from Costco.  5. Pick your soup base      For non-spicy eaters, go with chicken broth option. Everything else is spicy.  6. While waiting, visit the condiment stand, and concoct your own dipping sauce(s)  7. Server brings the soup pot to the table, and turn on the heat for you      Make sure to learn how to control the temperature, so you can crank it up or turn it off later. (Shouldn't be difficult anyway)  8. Cook away!"}
{"text":"I'm actually super sad to write this review! I loved Kintaro and thought their lunch special for $10.99 was awesome! I recently went back this week to discover that they have increased their price to $14.99. Although it's unlimited, I personally can never even finish one serving, let alone get a second, so for me this price isn't really worth it anymore. They also severely cut back on their menu, from 60 items to 40, and there's no more udon! Not my udon! Why, kintaro?? Why!? They also used to give you banchan with your meal (appetizers like kimchi and cucumbers), but they seemed to have stopped doing that as well. If you can put food away like a professional eater, you might still find this deal worth it though. For me, unfortunately, I'll have to start looking for a new lunch spot. #breakingmyheartkintaro"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat close to home! Tried the all you can eat menu a few times and then decided on the hotpot on our last visit. I'm disappointed that I hadn't tried it sooner and the sushi is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Yummy !   The food is served fresh as you order it unlike buffets where the food just sits under hot lights      it is all you can eat including sushi but pace yourself there is a large variety  of delicacies ranging from sushi to hot soups as well as fresh to order hibatchi     Don't forget about about the great appetizers as well the service was incredible and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So, I tried the all you can eat sushi this time and I was really confused because most of the reviews said that the sushi was really good and the best that some people have ever had, however I didn't get that same \"wow\" experience. I found it very mediocre and gummy. I still think Ginko in Tremont has the best sushi so far in Ohio."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Came here for sweetest day. Hubby got the all u can eat sushi which is all u can eat apps, salads, sushi, hibachi, teriyaki ,soups and ice cream. I got the hot pot. Asian fondue.  We shared . We enjoyed the hot pot. But next time will get the all u can eat sushi menu. For all the appetizers salads soups hibachi teriyaki. Soooo worth the price.  $25 for dinner but worth it. Lobster sushi roll was sooo good. Hibachi was good. Soups and salads on point. Hot pot, we got pork, beef, clams(which were huge and really fishy) crab, lil neck clams and mussels. Meat is very thinly sliced. So cooks quick. We made our own sauce at the sauce bar too. Oyster sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce with garlic and green onion mixed together.  We dipped our meat from the hot pot in there. Overall great experience. We will be back. They do have an ala cart menu as well. But spend the cash. In the end u eat way more than $25 worth of food. Its alot. Hot pot for one is a ton of food. Even the sushi all u can eat is a ton a food. A bit too much for one. If they gave smaller portions, id be able to try more things! Hey Jalita"}
{"text":"My daughter and I stumbled upon this place less then a month ago and have been back 3 more times. So delicious and fun. I always order the hot pot  and  she orders the Japanese menu ,then share. Love going ,staff is friendly and it would be a  great place for a large group."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! Everything I've tried has been delicious. My only complaint is the way the waiters and waitresses watch you eat, if someone at your table got the all you can eat and you didn't they watch you the entire time to make sure you don't eat any of their food! Very uncomfortable! Other than that it's worth a little awkward staring."}
{"text":"Good place! The Rangoon, soup and dumplings were all good appetizers. Sushi I would say is above average considering It's all you could eat, would actually say just as good as Mizu (dare I?) Shrimp Fried rice was tasty and the ice cream was great! I didn't get Hibachi because I feared an all you can eat it wouldn't be good but now I feel like I should have! Would recommend."}
{"text":"You cant beat all you can eat sushi! but make sure you order just the right amount or they will charge you 10.99/lb of extra food you didn't finish. the rolls are a descent size so I would suggest you start off small and go from there. $25 for dinner and I believe the lunch price is $15 which is a better deal if you can make it. they have a variety of different options to ones take and also hibachi. I would bring sushi lovers to this place!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal, high class all the way around. The sushi is very fresh and tasty and most importantly plentiful. There is a wide array of different types of sushi from nigiri, handrolls, and regular rolls. Some of the specialty rolls are actually named after automobiles which is unique in its own regard. I would highly recommend Kintaro to anyone who loves sushi. I also heard the hot pot isn't bad either maybe next time I'll try that but after having the sushi it'll be difficult to divert from that."}
{"text":"Very good hot pot. I have not tried the sushi buffet yet, but I had a very good experience here and I will come back soon. The whole restaurant was very clean, which was a bit surprising but very enjoyable. I highly recommend this place for hot pot."}
{"text":"I've only been here three times, but each time has been just as lovely as the last. Their food may be a little pricey, but you pay for what you get. The quality and portion sizes are fantastic. I've ordered the all you can eat twice and I left very full an satisfied. I've had their sushi, hibachi, soups, and appetizers and I would order them all again!"}
{"text":"What a surprising gem for Chinese hotpot around the Cleveland area! Kintaro offers authentic eats, with nice decor, good service, a quality environment, and a large space. My boyfriend and I have been here twice for dinner AYCE hotpot. The restaurant is a great go-to when you're hungry, craving Asian food, and not willing to bother with long wait times.  Firstly, the ingredients are fresh and the fishballs were surprisingly high quality. Wow that Fuchow Fish Ball (????; for those unfamiliar, it is a fish ball filled with pork). I have not had such fresh Fuchow fish balls before with such delicious flavor! The portions are also very generous. I've had their fatty beef, and while I personally prefer my beef to be thinner, it is good quality for AYCE.  I've gotten the chicken broth both times and it has been absolutely light, with just enough taste. As a nice plus, my chicken broth came with some Chinese herbs like goji berries (the orange-ish raisin-like fruit) and red dates (the sweet, wrinkled looking fruit) to add some additional flavor and nutrition. My boyfriend had the Sichuan Spicy soup base. This is not spice to mess around with. Sichuan spice emphasizes a numbing heat rather than the usual spicy heat others may be used to. Unless you are familiar with the spice, I would recommend trying something else, or mixing it with another base if possible. It is also a bit on the oily side, which may be upsetting to some stomachs.  The service is great, though admittedly hit or miss. Our first time, we had a younger waitress who did not walk us through how to order (we needed to ask), and she was not as attentive or helpful with our food. Our second visit was absolutely phenomenal, with Joanne as our waitress. She came over constantly asking us if we wanted to order more food, refilled our pots, and provided us with plates and switched them since my boyfriend had shellfish.  I was also super happy that there is a sauce station (YAY) with plenty of options where you can get eggs and other delicious condiments to accompany your hotpot.  Overall.. for its price, the environment, and the unique offering of such delicious hotpot, my boyfriend and I are very happy to have found a key restaurant to frequent and return to! The only \"downside\"? It's AYCE and they serve delicious ice cream at the end (ask for it, if they forgot to offer it to you), so I will need to watch my weight.  For newtimers: - Write your orders down (you can write the number) on separate paper [not the menu]; you can indicate serving size next to each (for example, 1/2 serving, 2 servings) -  You can ask for individual hotpot bowls, or have hotpot in the center to share with the group (up to two types of broth) -- Remember, you will be sharing a broth with others, so if you don't like some flavors your friends have ordered (e.g., tong hao cai or lamb), it may be worthwhile (though maybe less fun) to stick to your own - In my opinion, the service was fast enough where you could separate your order out (especially since they are raw ingredients); if you are not familiar with the serving size, and you tend to eat less, I recommend starting conservatively with 2 meat servings and 4 or so other additions. I've ordered 2 servings of beef and 6 additions .. and have been overly full each time; I may order half servings instead at my next visit so I can still have more options (we were a party of two- is less of an issue with more friends)  For people new to hotpot overall: - Chinese hotpot is usually eaten during the cold seasons, and is a way for groups to gather and share food around a hot pot to keep warm - Condiments: At home, I've had shacha sauce (soybean oil, garlic, dried shrimp, fish), which tastes like BBQ sauce, and some people will mix this with raw egg or peanut butter. The world is your oyster and there are plenty of condiments to choose from, so experiment! The dumpling sauce (vinegar and soy sauce) with sacha and green onion was delish - Usually, people will put in vegetables (especially the ones requiring longer cooking times) first, and cook meat individually. Use the soup ladle with holes to hold your meat and watch it to prevent overcooking. Beef is easier and faster to cook (you can get away with some redness), but make sure you cook other meats like fish, chicken and pork well - Hotpot is HOT- blow well or your tongue will get burned - Remember hotpot etiquette if you're sharing: pull the food you put in out, and cook with your ladle (try not to use chopsticks with uncooked meat) - At the start of hotpot, people usually dip their cooked meat in condiments; you can ask for an extra bowl (or take one from the sauce station) for a separate soup bowl. People usually have their soup (with or without noodles) at the end since the broth will have all the flavors from the meal at this time; it is also less salty since additional water was added - For ingredients, I like: fatty beef, Fuchow fish ball, fish tofu, spinach, and udon noodles"}
{"text":"Hot pot is something I had never done before! It is like fondue with fresh meat and vegetables baked in a broth. The sushi is also surprisingly good too! My favorites are the hummer roll and the Mini Cooper roll. Fun experience to do with a group of people and kids love it too because they can cook their food at the table!"}
{"text":"The food is quality. I still can't get over the fact the price of AYCE sushi or hotpot for the price they are offering at such a high quality. Though it was a bit of a drive for us, from Akron we made the trip twice in two weeks. I've been to many Hot Pot and sushi places and they are offering top quality spectrum at a buffet price. I mean what else can you ask for? We had a total of 15 people and they are more than happy to accommodate us. There was a bit of a wait since it is such a good deal. This might be my favorite place or at least top 3 anywhere I've been to because of the value."}
{"text":"Just what it says-- all you can eat sushi. Nice place for a late nosh. Great decor, and also has a private room for groups."}
{"text":"Hmmm..... Went back about two weeks later for Lunar New Year weekend. We wanted to try the hot pot. Just so you all know, there are NO LUNCH SPECIALS ON SUNDAY!! Their menu says that, but I missed that fact. Regardless! We still ate there. Food was still quality, and sooo many options. I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day! I still think the time limit should be 2.5/3 instead of 2 hours though.  The reason I went down in rating and feel the need to review again is because this was like an entirely different experience. My server, Cora, was really bad. Like the kind of shit attitude that lets you know she hates her job, but instead of quitting takes it out on customers. Every question was answered with exasperation. Every request with an eye roll. At times she was completely MIA. She really is making a bad environment for diners. Get lost, Cora. Like why are you ruining my day because you're cranky?? As far as I can tell, she works in the hotpot section. So I think you're safe from her if you sit anywhere else.  p.s. The szechuan hotpot broth was super oily. The shacha broth was good. Cora got upset when we didn't want oil for the hotpot broth and asked to switch."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and outstanding food.  We we're greeted in the traditional way by the extremely talented chefs.  None of the staff were in their phones and it was all service and genuine concern.  Food and drink were prompt and detail was attended to.  I will make this a frequent dining option.  A+."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. All you can eat sushi doesn't scream class but I assure you this place is as classy as it gets. Decorated beautifully, you are immediately comfortable here. The all you can eat sushi menu is out of this world and includes so much more. You can get hibachi, soups, salads, appetizers all for $14.99 at lunch! The sushi menu was very big and had everything you could want. Service was wonderful and staff couldn't have been nicer. This will be the ONLY place we go for sushi from now on!"}
{"text":"In reality, I'd give this three and a half stars. I went in for the lunch buffet with a friend.   The sauce bar is good. There's lots of options so you can experiment. They also have eggs at the bar so be sure to grab some for your hot pot!   Service was good, they came and poured water into our hot pots and did a good job keeping our drinks full.  Broth itself was tasty. However, the all you can eat wasn't quite what I expected. There's only two worthwhile meat options. I would have liked to see a few more options like lamb or marinated meats. The quality just wasn't there.  Also, they forgot an item at times when bringing things out but we reordered what was missed so no harm there.   Parking is plentiful here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only do they have quality sushi, but for the all you can eat price you're more than getting your money's worth. My boyfriend and I just stopped in looking for just another Chinese buffet, but we're already planning our next visit with friends. Plus I think it's really creative that most of their maki rolls are named after car brands."}
{"text":"This place is totally worth the all you can eat sushi special. Their sashimi and hand tools were stellar. The specialty tile were not exactly my favorite but much better than I have found in most of cleveland. Can't wait to go back and try their hot pot."}
{"text":"For my first hot pot experience, I think it was a pretty great one! I picked Kintaro because I have some picky family members with me and our group of 5 was able to settle on all-you-can-eat hot pot and all-you-can-eat sushi. We split a big pot of 2 different broths (szechuan and chicken broth) and a bunch of various meats and veggies. The soups were delicious and it's basically like soup fondue in that you cook your meat and veggies in the boiling broth and then eat them. It was a lot of fun, and very tasty! The all-you-can-eat sushi was super high quality. These aren't just your standard hand rolls or basic rolls, you can get super creative rolls as well. We found something to please everyone, and next time I come back to Ohio, this place is definitely on my list!"}
{"text":"Maaaaaaan.....  Let me start off by saying that I'm not a big hot pot fan. I live my pho and my boiled greens with pork but I just can't get into hot pot. With that said, I came here for the sushi so stop with what you're thinking in your head.  My cousin came into town so on his last night, we came here before he left for home. Some of the other guys in the party had already been here but this was my first. There were 8 of so we got 4 hot pots and 4 sushi so we could all enjoy it without them having to watch over us and us having to watch over our shoulders. It worked out great. I don't know if they offer anything else besides the \"buffet\" deal but it's gotta suck being the sushi chefs at a \"buffet\" place like this. The hot pot menu is pretty vast from what I saw. The sushi menu is pretty standard fare, as I would expect. Selection wise was a lot better than I had expected though. You get to choose from sashimi, nigiri, hand rolls, and rolls. They even offer Hibachi dinners you can order. The portion on that is rather small but it's fine as it's a all you can eat. Overall, I was pretty impressed but I don't know if I ate my money's worth. I only ordered sushi and it took forever to come out. While waiting, I ate some boiled meats since I was hella hungry.  Would I come back? Maybe. I'm coming from Akron so it's a long drive after pigging out. I was told there's actually a 2hr time limit for customers but with how long it takes for sushi to come out, I would hate to get booted because of the time limit and more than half of it was spent waiting for my food. Again, we came in a SLOW weekday night and we waited a bit. I can't imagine the wait on a busy day."}
{"text":"Eating Japanese-style hot pot at Kintaro can be an interesting culinary experience, even if the quality of the food is just okay. The restaurant is family-friendly, located out in a stripmall and filled with massive tables and booths.   But the garrish decor is not the only reason why you'll note this is not a fancy restaurant.  Nor is the troth of peanuts at the entrance.  The booth seats are deeply broken in, the chopsticks are cheap and will splinter, and the electric burner in the table won't heat evenly.    Nevertheless, we enjoyed adding a dozen tasty meats, noodles, and veggies to our pot.  Be adventurous and try out some of the less familiar items.  Just be careful, it IS possible to create an unappetizing mess.  Be sure keep an eye on you additions as they take only a minute to cook through, especially the meats.   Remember that the sauces are for dipping.   I would order these again: balls of fish (caution: they get very hot), taro, cabbage, black mushroom, lotus root, chinese lettuce, bean sprouts, tong hao cai, tofu skin, turnip, enoki, watercress, and wood ear.    I would definitely not reorder bamboo shoot (its from a can), the corn cob (popular, but too starchy), frozen tofu, or whole shrimp (not worth the mess of shelling them at the table).  Many of the items come to you frozen: clumps of noodles, seafood, and some vegetables with ice on them. It would be nice if they even went to the trouble to defrost them first!  Anywhere else it would be scandalous to serve frozen food where it was meant to be fresh, but at Kintaro that seems to be the norm.    Lastly, the soup-base was very disappointing.  The six options are made of the same powdered mix, which is also available in crystallized form at the sauce station.   I recommend eating here at least once, just be sure to keep your expectations reasonably low."}
{"text":"I have only been one time when the restaurant first opened and that one visit was amazing. The prices were great and food/ sushi tasted fresh! Staff was super friendly and didn't care that we brought in McDonald's for the kid that was with us and is a very very picky eater. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I went there last Wednesday w my friend, have a big hope that this place gonna impressed me because my group of friend been there before and they loved it. I'm not too picky about my food but things at least need to be right, the server gave us papers to write on our proteins and veggies for the hotpot. We wrote the number down nice and clear, even separated it out meat, seafoods, balls and veggies. We put down beef, lamb and pork stomach.. but then when the server brought out the plate of protein, there were liver and kidney on it. All the veggies were messed up and missing mushroom. So entire order we wrote down I don't even know if they even look at it or just threw stuff on there whatever. I know it's buffet place... but you guys brought stuff out that we can't even eat like pork liver and stuff? Then you gonna charge extra fine $10 per lbs if we didn't finish the food? How is that make any sense? Please at least the people in the back should remember all the numbers so won't mess up people orders. Also the most grossed me out was on the instant noodle they brought out to us, there was mold on it! Green mold on it and I even told the server to look at it and she said omg there is mold, she brought me a new one but I can't even eat it.  Overall, it was just okay. Hope you guys improve on these mistakes, I just wanna let you guys know, if you still want customers to come"}
{"text":"This is not a buffet, but an all you can eat made to order sushi and hot pot restaurant. We both had the all you can eat sushi, along with grilled calamari, hibachi shrimp and two drinks. Very good food and very reasonably priced at 14.99 per person, not including drinks. So glad we had this for lunch so we had the rest of the day to wear off our food!  Waiters and staff are all very accommodating and happy to explain any questions you might have. Restaurant was clean, decor was nice, and restrooms were clean as well. We will definitely go back with friends!"}
{"text":"While not cheap, it does offer something that is relatively rare--all you can eat made-to-order sushi and japanese fare.  Unlike other such restaurants, they do not (in general) overload portion sizes on side dishes like the salad or soup.  It is easy to mark your selection on a large menu sheet and ask for another as you make for round 2 and maybe even 3.  I thought their sashimi had extremely small portion size--like 3x smaller and quality was OK.  Their sushi was well made--they don't overladen the rice but still not up to par with the best.  On one serving, their sushi roll was excessively large--I thought it was wrong to make one portion that large for one person.  Overall, very good for all you can eat but the quality still is not up to par with a la carte."}
{"text":"I just could not get over the smell of this place. It almost ruined my appetite. I opted for the buffet style menu and was not too happy with the idea of paying so much money for the food but any left overs would be tacked on to my bill as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in with family and a friend for a sit down 'to-order' dinner (not the buffet) to give it a try since they re-opened as Kintaro. I'm disappointed to say we were all let down by the service and the food, but especially the service.   We all had the miso soup to start and all 4 were cold. The fried squid app was the Sysco Foods frozen variety that look like fast food onion rings, also cold. The spicy tuna roll and salmon roll I had were a joke ... I've had better spicy tuna roll from Giant Eagle in the evening, if that tells you anything. Shrimp tempura roll was just ok; nothing to write home about. My mom and brother were not impressed by their dinner either or that it took 45 minutes for it to come out, and we all agreed that the place on Brookpark across from Sam's Club is 100 times better than this. The herbal tea we had was served cold and came in a can, when I was told it would be hot tea. We asked to split the check and they had 3 items mixed around on the wrong check  -_-   ... come on, at least get the bill right.  I didn't even bother to point out the check thing and just tipped my regular amount, accepting that  this was a waste of our time and knowing that I will not be back.  From now on I'll just stick with my two favorite Asian restaurants on the west side: Mizu Sushi when I want sushi and Thai Kitchen in Lakewood when I want  Thai food ... simple as that. If anyone else finds better than those two, I'd love to try them out."}
{"text":"Good food horrible service. 7 of 9 people in my party received food accordingly. One never received and the other waited 1 hr 20 min. Never an appollogy. Never had an answer why is wasn't being made. Checked several times to double check the order but always said it's on the way.."}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi. Went with a group of 8 for dinner. There are plenty of options for sushi, sashimi, hibachi, teriyaki, appetizers, tempura, etc. The quality of food was pretty good and fresh. I wonder if the lunch sushi buffet has a different menu since it's much cheaper..."}
{"text":"I love this sushi buffet - the staff is super nice, the rolls are varied and delicious and I always leave here stuffed. I really like how you can order pretty much anything off the menu and you're guaranteed to get something good."}
{"text":"All you can eat Sushi.... Need not say more....the food is great and the presentation is outstanding. Bubble Tea (strawberry) us the best!! Everything is fresh!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm hot pot. I love hot pot and have been waiting for CLE to get a hotpot restaurant for some time (and am too lazy to buy the hot pot and all the ingredients myself, so having a restaurant is quite nice).  It's a large restaurant- one side is for the sushi/hibatchi and the other side is solely dedicated to hot pot. The tables have the electric burner in the middle as well as accommodating individual hot pots with individualized controls, etcera.  The waitress was Chinese and proceeded on speaking Mandarin to me the moment we sat down. haha. Luckily I can understand enough, but am pretty horrible on responding, so I just answered back in English- and the waitress switched to English for me. haha.  We did not follow the other yelp reviews and went for dinner instead. It's just hard to make it out to this area during lunch time (and seriously, who has TIME to leave work for lunch???!). Anyways, the dinner price is $24.95 (or $32.95 if you get the premium seafood stuffs) for all you can eat hot pot. So, come hungry. You'll have a time limit of 2 hours and if you waste food, they'll charge you by the pound (I mean, it makes sense, right? Just don't be wasteful!).  There are various soup bases to pick from- I always like having a mixed soup hot pot, so we got the sha cha flavor as well as the Sichuan spicy (which...was pretty spicy!).   You then proceed to look at the menu and write down on a piece of paper (kind of like dim sum style), what you want. There's a large assortment of meats (ranging from fatty lamb/beef, liver, stomach, chicken gizzard, etc), large assortment of seafood (crab, clam, mussels, fish fillets, etc), typical balls you cook in hot pot (various fish balls like cuttlefish or homemade fish balls, beef balls, etc), and other items like many different veggies, lotus root, fish tofu, wood ear, etc etc, the list is quite huge. To me, you don't even need to get the \"premium\" hot pot special, because just the general is fine.  Off to the side, there's also a station where you can get various sauces and toppings to go with your food.  We got: - Fatty lamb - Fatty beef - Fuchow fish ball - Cuttlefish fish ball - Homemade fish ball - Fish Tofu - Wood Ear - Watercress  All were very good- I was impressed with the cuts of the fatty lamb and beef and our favorite was definitely the homemade fish ball and the fish tofu. We got second plates of those.  Overall, I thought the hot pot was very good. I thought the soups could be a tad more flavorful (maybe I've been spoiled from hot pot restaurants in different cities), but for the quality and amount of food you get (I mean, it's all you can eat- it's practically a buffet), I thought it was good. I think it's probably a BETTER price and choice to come during lunch, but if you're busy working ppls like us, we don't have time for that!   If it's cold and you're craving some good warm healthy food, check out this hot pot place- and probably come for lunch to get the most bang for your buck (but I do think it's worth the dinner price- just come with a big appetite!)."}
{"text":"So this place used to be a Chinese buffet, and we came in today not realizing it had changed to more of a higher end Japanese/Sushi/Hibachi restaurant..... At first we were confused about how/what to order.... I kind of wanted to leave... Thank goodness we stuck it out... We ended up with the all you can eat sushi and Hibachi menu ($25.99 each)....  Once we figured out the ordering process and started getting the food, it was amazing!  Really high quality, well prepared and tasteful food! Out waiter was really kind and patient with us... The location was beautifully redone inside - very clean, sleek, and modern.  They do need to add a kids menu option. The experience is a bit different, and I assume there will be some growing pains, but I think this place is fantastic overall.  We will be back!  Note:  I'm personally not a fan of sushi, I primarily ate Hibachi today.  We did try some of the sushi and it was better than I'd expected... I think a big sushi fan would LOVE this place - and it's super deal!  They also have a Hot Pot option, where you cook food in broth in a pot at your table, looked good, we didn't try it, but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"When I heard there was an all you can eat hot pot place close to home, I was sold already. I was even more excited when I got up there and saw all the different kinds of meat and vegetables and sides that there are available and how fresh all the ingredients were. The person running the front is always really attentive, especially considering how busy it has been every time we have gone and when we have been waited on the service has always been great. My favorite things to order are the Szechuan broth, the beef and the pork and their homemade fish balls. I haven't ordered the sushi there ever because I have never had any more room after eating hot pot. The broth is always good, but it think there is a lot of salt in it. Only down sides are when ordering the fish for the hot pot it has always been mushy and not very edible so definitely pass on the fish! Besides that, the hot pot has always been good if you are looking to eat hot pot without having to go through the trouble of making it at home!"}
{"text":"This was 1000x better than any Chinese AYCE buffet!  While you still get AYCE, it is made fresh to order and yu don't have to be concerned about all the people hovering over the food or handling utensils.  The quality of the sushi menu was very good.  They also offer hot pot and other cooked foods.  The cost was about $25/person but if you love sushi and can consume vast quantities like me then it's worthwhile."}
{"text":"I love this place and come here weekly.  I will do the 'AYCE' sushi option and start with a few apps/salads before digging in to sushi and sashimi.  I love that this is made to order, not buffet, and the plates that come to the table are BEAUTIFUL. The team does such a great job and everything looks wonderful, is well balanced and constructed, and is high quality.  This sushi is good not just compared to other AYCE or buffets, but it is good to other sushi places in NEO period. Great quality.    The only part I don't care for is that the 'specialty rolls' tend to be a bit odd and are very similar to each other. I wish there was a little more variety here and a little less shrimp tempura + spicy mayo and eel sauce.  But!! The spicy scallop roll, beautiful sashimi, and regular rolls more than make up for it.  (The music is a little loud...)  I only tried the hot pot once, which was spectacular, but hot pot can never win a competition against sushi. :)"}
{"text":"I found this place on the Yelp app coming from Ohio and was looking for a place to eat dinner and was craving AYCE sushi and found this place with high ratings.  This is the real deal, high class all the way around. The sushi is fresh and tasty and most importantly plentiful. There is a wide array of different types of sushi from nigiri, handrolls, and regular rolls. Some of the specialty rolls are actually named after cars which is unique and a nice spin on things. They have red tuna sashimi when I went, which lots of AYCE sushi places don't have it and was happy when they did. I ordered tons of that.  I would highly recommend Kintaro to anyone who loves sushi. I also heard the hot pot isn't bad either maybe next time I'll try that but after having the sushi it'll be difficult to divert from that.  Other then that, I will be visitng eating at this place again when I am passing through most definitely."}
{"text":"We went for the all you can eat sushi. We were so surprised by the tastiness and freshness of the sashimi! The special rolls were okay, but nothing to write home about. Anything that says \"crab\" alone will be imitation crab, FYI. But there are real crab options like the spider roll. We will be back for the hot pot :)"}
{"text":"This used to be a buffet and it was, at best, questionable. They have completely transformed this space and it is beautiful! Actually, I was quite impressed and you can tell from my reviews that's hard to do. ;-)  The hostess, server and manager were all very friendly and helpful. We wanted just sushi, so we ordered individual rolls. Every roll was fresh, delicious and was served very quickly to us. We'd love to try all-you-can-eat for $25.99 sometime, but today was not the day.    The best part is that the rolls were a lot less costly than the place we normally go (which, btw, doesn't even serve sushi on Mondays, which is why we ended up at Kintaro!)  So glad we tried this place, it might just be our new go-to for sushi!  My only complaint is that they don't serve iced tea. I like a cold, unsweet tea with lemon to accompany my sushi!"}
{"text":"I arrived at this place at a saturday evening looking for a good all you can eat sushi buffet. I went here based on the reviews and the pic as well. Soon as you walk in the hostess tells you about the all you can eat sushi buffet which is $25.99 per person or you can get seated with the regular menu. I decided to get the sushi buffet since I was very hungry and in the mood for sushi. Once seated the waiter brings out the menu and explains the rules. You can order as much appetizers as you want and the hibachi's as well without any charge. The sushi you order has to be mostly eaten but you can leave a few pieces out. They charge you $10.99/lb for food waste and whatever they charge you are able to take home. I started out with the dumplings, edamame, and spring rolls. The edamame was bland and it was very furry which was very unusual for me. The dumplings were okay but the spring rolls were very delicious. Once finished with that I ordered the Mercedes Benz, Lobster and California. The lobster was very delicious, but the Mercedes Benz was okay. They do give you about 12 rolls or so for the speciality rolls and for the classic rolls they give you 6. So be prepared to expect more on the specialty rolls. Since I was quite full I decided to order the udon beef noodles as well and the chicken and shrimp hibachi. The udon beef noodles were thick and the broth was very flavorful. The hibachi was amazing as well! Overall I got full off the all you can eat sushi buffet and as well as ordered a lot. The sushi portion gives you a lot but the flavor in the sushi wasn't as good as i thought. I think the price is little pricy but the food quality is really good. I would defiantly come back here for the food but maybe not for the buffet."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time today! We did a hot pot and AYCE sushi. They let us share. Everything was top notch and amazing! The hot pot was so much fun and it was some of the best sushi we've ever had! Our server was lovely and was so kind to help explain everything to us several times. :) She really helped to make our first time experience a great one! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first foray into Asian Hot Pot and I have to say I'm a new convert.  I wasn't really sure what to expect but my expectations were far exceeded.  Our server helped explain how the ordering worked - pick your broth, pick your noodle option, and then pick your meat, seafood and vegetables. Once you place your order they will bring out some pickled cucumbers and tomato and some peanuts to snack on before your hot pot arrives.  Most people around opted for the shared pot in the center of the table with split broth, unfortunately my dining partner was allergic to fish so we opted to two separate pots.  There are many options in the sauce bar to make a customized dipping sauce.  Unbeknownst to me beforehand, you really don't drink the broth - it's similar to fondu, it's just a vessel to cook your meats and veggies inside.  The Shacha broth was nicer than the chicken broth but I'd like to try Szechuan next time.  I would say to skip the noodles, too filling.  The meats were very thinly sliced and slightly frozen, which is to be expected given the thinness of the slice.  The crab was good as well, the shrimp balls were just okay, and the pork balls I didn't particular like.  I would like to try the fish balls next time.  Bok choy and Chinese cabbage are a great filling addition, you can also get lettuce to make little wraps with the meats.  During dinner you can order as many items and as many times as you want, two things to remember you have a 2 hour time limit and there is a 10% charge per pound of waste. I will definitely be back to try the lunch portion since I found dinner a little too pricey for the amount of food I was actually able to consume, which wasn't much since after one plate that included noodles I was pretty full."}
{"text":"Very authentic hot pot. Went there for 10.99 lunch special and it was definitely a good deal for what I got. You are allowed to choose only 7 items but it was enough food. Personally I feel like if I was able to get full from the lunch special, it would be a waste of money to go for their all you can eat hot Pot at night for 25 bucks. The quality and quantity were satisfying. If you are a student at case you also get 10% discount. The service was excellent. I would totally recommend this place if you want some special Chinese hot pot experience."}
{"text":"FINALLY. OH GODS FINALLY HOT POT. My parents who live in NEOH can't stop talking about this place. Their friends can't stop talking about this place. They happily drive an hour to get here.  The portions are extremely (Extremely! 2 meals p/p for _not_ \"all you can eat\") generous, and everything is incredibly fresh. The meat is unfortunately disturbingly fatty, and the broth is salty but not very flavorful -- but I say this being hopelessly spoiled because I come from the San Francisco Bay Area where there's a really great hotpot joint on every corner.  I'll happily come back here (as if my parents would give me a choice!), but I do hope they trade impossibly large portions for higher quality food."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place out! Got seated and then ignored for 20 minutes. So nope."}
{"text":"Came here for the $10.99 lunch special. This is a great deal for the amount of food you are given. Our group of five had a choice to either share two large pots of broth or to each have our own smaller, individual pot. We chose the latter.   I decided on the sha cha broth with rice noodles, chicken meat, frozen crab, shrimp balls, fish tofu, dumplings and quail eggs. We received complimentary side dishes that were similar to Korean banchan. Our server was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full. They will also refill your broth if needed.   Altogether, a pleasant experience. P.S., remember to check in for a free beverage!"}
{"text":"Holy Asian jackpot. This place on the outside may look like a typical Chinese buffet... But do not dare Judge the book by its cover. It is absolutely not that. This is not a buffet, all the food is ordered them made. This is my favorite all you can eat sushi place. And I am a sushi snob. Although it is not the highest quality it is the number one place you can go for all you can eat sushi. Then there is the all you can eat hot pot... Which is high-quality. So I love to go here when it is time to pig out. I REGRET NOTHING."}
{"text":"This is for the ayce sushi but I'm certain their ayce hotpot is just as good if the sweet sauce bar is any indication.  This is one of the truest ayce sushi places I've been to.  No restrictions on sashimi!  No per order limit!  My friend and I sat down for dinner and ordered over 30 pieces of sashimi.  The salmon was nice & marbled...mmm.  Their hibachi is also part of ayce (its actually quite a big menu), and we each got an order and it was a perfect complement to our fish gluttony.   It is definitely worth the cost.   I wish there was a place like this in my home town. :("}
{"text":"Sushi quality is great and the portions are perfect. It is all you can eat, but I love that it's not a buffet style and they make them as you order. However, if you \"over-order\" and don't eat it, they charge you for the wasted for they tell you. $25.95 for all you can eat sushi dinner with apps and desert included. Pretty fair."}
{"text":"If Chinese style hotpot is what you're after, Kintaro won't disappoint. They have pretty much anything you'd want to compliment your hotpot: tons of greens, noodle options, different types of meat and fishballs, root vegetables, thinly sliced meat, seafood, etc. They have four broths to choose from: Szechuan, Chinese herb, Shacha (a satay style base), and chicken broth. Our group ended up trying out the Szechuan and the Chinese herb. Personally, I wasn't so impressed with the Szechuan; it tasted really one note with a high level of spiciness but almost no flavor. The Chinese herb however was really good; it was a good balance of light and flavorful, while still allowing you to enjoy the flavor of the add-ons. They also do have the mix your own sauce bar, so you can pick and choose different sauces to compliment your hotpot items.   I was surprised to find that Kintaro has really improved upon the space which was formerly Hong Kong King Buffet. The setup is largely the same, quite spread out and open, but they've added more high end decor, and of course the installed table burners for the hotpot. The service though was sort of hit or miss; the servers didn't take the best initiative to make sure our hotpot was filled, nor did he check back often for refills. Given that the customer is paying $25 for the all you can eat experience, I do think this is an important component, and I wish they'd do a better job of preparing their staff to anticipate the guests needs. There is a small upcharge if you don't finish what you order (I believe 10%) which is pretty fair. However, I feel like they purposefully don't really bring you as much as you order, which is sort of annoying. If the guests weren't being charged for extras, I could understand, but given that upcharge, they really should bring everything the guests order. I didn't try the sushi on this visit, but that's largely because I rarely care for AYCE sushi... to each his own I suppose. The rest of the hotpot add-ons were pretty much on point though; I love how much they had to choose from, and while it isn't the most high quality cuts of meat, I don't think detracts from the experience since Kintaro is more about quantity over quality. I feel like $25 is pretty standard for this type of AYCE, but I would definitely try to come back during lunch when they offer the same deal for just $11. Given there really isn't any comparable hotpot restaurant in the Cleveland area, I think this place satisfies, and it's definitely worth a try, especially if you've never had hotpot before."}
