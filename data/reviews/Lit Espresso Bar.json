{"text":"Simply THE BEST. The pizza is leopard speckled perfectionnnn and the coffee is seriously good. Their espresso drinks are smooth and often pleasantly surprising, packing a punch of citrus or chocolate or another note dialed in to blissful perfection. SERIOUSLY THIS PLACE IS LIT!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee places. The cappuccino is fabulous. I enjoyed the coffee as well. I've been here a few times now and the staff are always friendly and no one is rushing you out the door. I hope they expand their snack menu."}
{"text":"Went here for some coffee and tea with my boyfriend. He said the Americano was awfully made (the girl that made it probably doesn't know what she's doing or has never tried her own work or something). The iced tea that I had was good, but under steeped in my opinion. This place could use some work..."}
{"text":"The pizza in this place is as good as Queen Margherita Pizza. Very tasty. I had the Funghi and my husband the Margherita. We taste tested both, Mmmmmm! Service was amazing. This will definitely become my go to pizza place as it is very near my home. My only slight complaint is that the chilli oil was a bit bland and really needs to soak up some flavour from some chilli flakes. Very clean and modern, with a great atmosphere for lunch, and really good background music too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and food. Love the vibe and the service is awesome! Happy to have an independent option."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Cheese was fresh. The fried Mushroom salad was also a big surprise.  Overall great experience, will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Walking down Bloor St, I came upon LIT. The server was very pleasant and sat us down. Decided to split a pizza and salad with my better half. Had the mushroom pizza. It was magnificent. The cheese was top notch!! Also they provide some Chili Oil in case I wanted to add some heat. Sure did. Pleasant neighborhood place to grab a pizza and wine."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favourite coffee places to frequent. The latte is excellent, as are the baked goods. The pizza is good too. I wish they had sandwiches, such as a caprese or boconcini sandwich, or tuna. I would come a lot more frequently if there were more offerings other than pizza/salad. The decor is trendy and nice service."}
{"text":"Dropped by Bloor West Village which seems to be inundated with coffee option, where this used to be a coffee desert only a few years ago. Atmosphere is comfy and unique to lit. Started with an ice coffee and had a cookie, both were pretty good. Staff is friendly. I think they have a winner."}
{"text":"Went in to give the pizza a try and the place looks spectacular and the service is really good. Really has a lot of potential. 
We got the margherita pizza. The dough was chewy and seemed to have a bitterness to it. Tomatoes were a little too acidic. Basil on top was really old and not fresh at all. 
This place absolutely can do much better but needs to get it in gear. I think they realized after we got our pizza that the basil was bad and went out and got some. (Not for us - just to replenish their stock is guess)"}
{"text":"We had the margarita pizza for lunch recently. It was good, but there was a harsh bitter taste to the crust... We love pizza, and expect the charred crust, but the taste of this one was just too bitter... It was like you could tell the pizza would be good if not for the harshness of that black dough... The people were very friendly and it was lovely to sit and chat with other diners, but rarely do we not finish a pizza..."}
