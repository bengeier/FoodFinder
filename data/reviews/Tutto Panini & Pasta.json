{"text":"The owner makes some great home made pasta dishes. Highly recommend trying the Rotolo!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are generous and their pastas are simple and delicious. I was so impressed by their tomato sauce, it was perfect - light and fresh with small chunks of tomato in it. The owner is very friendly and is willing to customize orders for your preferences. 

I ordered a veal and eggplant sandwich and was dissapointed. Maybe I came on an off day, the veal was dry and the eggplant was too chewy to eat.

 I have had their pasta and LOVED it. There is an option to get tomato, alfredo, meat or rose sauces. I will definitely be back for more delicious pasta."}
{"text":"There are veal sandwiches and there are veal sandwiches. This place was more than exceptional!The owner  was friendly and accommodating the food was great and the salad waa like it was picked minutes after i placed my order. This is a hidden Markham gem and a must try. Call ahead on Thursday and Friday as the specials vary.You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to have some lasagne, but unfortunately they didn't have any available. So instead, I ordered the special. Veal sandwich with all toppings. The sandwich was massive, it was as large as my big head.
Sandwich was great. Extremely messy, don't wear a white shirt eating this. And make sure you can afford to take a nap right after."}
{"text":"Tutto is a small friendly shop with about seating for 10 people inside. They also have a fridge for prepared pasta and food. I ordered the veal with mushrooms and peppers. Overall the sandwich was good - nice soft chewy bun but I was kinda of disappointed with the toppings as there wasn't much. The veal was tasty but the rest of it was so-so. I guess I have been spoiled by the giant veal sandwiches at St. Lawrence market."}
{"text":"Tutto Panini & Pasta is newly opened in the strip mall at the corner of Markham Road and 16th. 

A good option if one has a craving for some Italian sandwiches in the area. 

Veal on a Bun ($5) is one of the grand opening special which was quite tasty. Free onion and pepper toppings with other option for $1 more.

Tutto is a decent place if you want something fast and decent for lunch. Opens till 11 pm on weekends!"}
