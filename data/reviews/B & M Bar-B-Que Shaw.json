{"text":"I like a sense of adventure so I went to the place with the bullet proof glass to get my -Que on. I ordered the pork shoulder dinner with baked beans and fries. They give you a ton of pork and it's good not, not great.  Beans are okay and fries sucked. In terms of Cleveland's overall BBQ I'd give it about a 4 (on a scale of 1 to 10. B&M  is a solid 5-5.5. I'd go there again. Trythe red velvet cake, too. It's really good."}
