{"text":"I ate there recently when I was in Cleveland on a business trip.  I'm a \"food tourist\" and found out about HSW from Man vs Food.  What I loved: the Polish Boy!!!!! OMG that was sooooo good.  The fries, coleslaw, and their unique bbq sauce just work with the polish sausage to create a one-of-a-kind taste treat sensation in your mouth!  It was so ridiculously good I talked some business colleagues into going back with me a few days later and they were pretty impressed.  One of them had the fried chicken (with their signature sauce on top) and he said it was damned good.  I also tried some of their ribs which were okay -- I was expecting better considering this is a bbq/soul food joint but they weren't as tender as I expected.  That said, they weren't bad.  On my second trip, I tried the Polish Girl (which is the Polish Boy plus pulled pork on top of everything else); I was surprised but I preferred the Polish Boy over the Polish Girl. It's not that the pulled pork is bad --- it's great --- but it's one too many flavors in my mouth at once.  It wasn't bad but it just wasn't necessary.  What was so-so: the decoration and atmosphere is that of a run down old restaurant.  That said....WHO CARES???  I come for the food, not the decorations.  You want decorations? Go to the Cheesecake Factory.  It's a dive but it's reasonably clean and it wasn't that bad.  The neighborhood isn't great but I went during the daytime (by bus, no less) and felt reasonably safe.  Nobody gave me the 'evil eye' even though it was pretty obvious I was \"not from around here.\"  The service: the people behind the counter weren't all smiles and energy but they got the job done and the food tasted good. Before going there, I read all the Yelp reviews and a lot of people are trashing the employees and their attitude.  Again, it's NOT the Cheesecake Factory with some chirpy employee who acts like your meal is their mission in life.  These people would probably rather be somewhere else.  But I wasn't ignored, they were reasonably courteous (again, it was VERY clear I was a tourist from out of town), and the food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time, done cleanly, and it tasted great.  If Cheesecake Factory level service is super important to you, you won't enjoy this place.  In short, come for the food, not the decorations and the service (which isn't that bad, just don't expect to be treated like a god).  If I ever have another trip to Cleveland, I am going to HSW again.  PS They do sell the bbq sauce in bottles and I brought a few home to try and recreate the Polish Boy."}
{"text":"Had another Cleveland first the other night at Hot Sauce Williams, the Polish boy!  Dag, soooo good!  The sauce is the boss here too, and I'm totally gonna buy a bottle of it next time I stop in.  It was a Monday night around 9pm, but they still had a security guard sitting at a table near the entrance.  Not sure what they were expecting to go down, but along with the sign on the front door requiring anyone wearing a hood to pull it back before entering, didn't sound like it was anything pleasant.  The larger old woman sitting behind the counter was probably scratching her head as to why I was there, but was delightful nonetheless, continuing her singing after I'd placed my order.  Can't wait to get, like, 5 more!"}
{"text":"This is probably going to be one of my favorite places that I stopped at on my cross-country trip...thanks yelpers for letting me know it's worth going to the shadier part of cleveland (which isn't THAT bad) to get my grub on.  The two things you have to get when you go to this joint are the macaroni and cheese (my husband says it's the best he ever had and he's a snob when it comes to fatty foods) and the fried chicken (this was so juicy and flavorful on this inside and deliciously crispy on the outside). OMG, seriously run there is you have the privilege of being in Cleveland.   Oh, and a few other pointers: Cornbread was not good at all. I didn't try the coleslaw because it was super lathered in mayo. We also had the pulled pork sandwich, which was really good too. The bbq sauce is flavorful, but not hot at all. I liked it on the pork, but I'm glad I didn't get the fried chicken drenched in the sauce - better on its own."}
{"text":"SLOW SLOW SLOW!!!  I'm a vegetarian but was the driver for my group of friends.  I didn't' mind that there were only a few side dishes that I could order. But, I ordered fries and it took 25 mins for them to have them ready for me.  My friends enjoyed their chicken but we were all upset about the 25 min wait at a \"fast food\" restaurant."}
{"text":"So torn. I love their food. We wanted a polish boy. Yelp says open until 1:30, it is 10:26 pm and drive thru dude says they're closed. What? If you're normal and visit during normal hours, I gave hsw 5 plus stars. But consistence is nice too."}
{"text":"Without a single doubt the absolute best fried chicken I have ever had. Ribs were good but not crazy noteworthy or anything. Historic Cleveland establishment. Go here."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday evening and there was a line about 10 people in front of me. I ordered a 3 pieces white dinner and was expected to get my food within 10-15 mins; however it took me about more than half hour to get the food. It's fair to say that efficiency was not their priority. Despite the service the food was absolutely amazing. Great value with great taste. The chicken breasts were tender and not too oily. The sauce was top natch."}
{"text":"I like to do Man vs. Food tours whenever I visit a city for work, and while planning for Cleveland, Hot Sauce Williams and their Polish Boy definitely made it onto my list of must eats. Man oh man, it did not disappoint. That Polish Boy is AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of your typical hotdog with coleslaw, not so much hot sauce or putting fries on things. But I'm telling you, this thing is spot on! The hot sauce wasn't too hot, the fries melded together with everything else in a special and tasty way, and the slaw and kielbasa were delicious. You have to try it if you get the chance. No wonder it's a signature Cleveland food.   I did do the drive thru (after reading other reviews this white girl didn't want to risk going inside by herself late on a Saturday night) but didn't have any issue with a long wait - maybe 3 minutes tops. Glad there were no harassing panhandlers around either. I was bummed they were out of banana pudding but the strawberry cheesecake was ok.   Bottom line: go get yourself a Polish Boy!"}
{"text":"Let me just apologize to the food gods right now for having taken 20 years of my life to finally try this hometown legend.   I had heard that their fried chicken was possibly the most delicious thing that could ever touch your lips but my god.... I'm speechless. I've had so much amazing fried chicken I can't even think, but Hot Sauce William's was so far above anything I've ever tasted. It had the perfect crisp yet the chicken was moist n juicy n the breading was heavenly not to mention his signature hot sauce was sooooo &@*!%# delicious it isn't even funny. I had the 3 piece dinner special for about $9 to go and some is still left in my fridge eagerly awaiting tomorrow morning. Leftovers have never sounded so good!  Two huge thumbs up! I'll be back next week!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived about a mile from this place for most of my life and have eaten here a lot.  I really want this place to be a hidden gem, but it isn't.  I could get by the dirty interior, rude service, and long wait times if the food was something special.  But the food is nothing special. The sides are often cold a bland, the fried chicken is what you get at the prepared food section of a grocery store, and the ribs are tough. The sauce is like sugared ketchup - there is nothing \"hot\" about the place."}
{"text":"Omg!  I have been eating there of and on for years and the quality has just gone down.  I don't know why but the meat seems to be of lower quality and poor cut.  The service is no longer stellar as it used to be.  I ordered a simple rib dinner and the ribs were stringy and tough and the fries were mush.  I dont like to give poor ratings but this is just not the level of service that I know hot sauce used to give and it needs to be rectified."}
{"text":"Decided that I had to check this place out since I am a huge fan of Adam Richman and he featured it on Man vs Food. He also wrote a section on Cleveland in his book, 'America the Edible', and he name drops this spot.   My fiancee and I were not disappointed, it definitely hit the spot. I loved the sauce. Ryan tried the Polish Boy which basically a kielbasa, with sauce, and cole slaw piled on top. The french fries are smushed in on the side, but definitely a tasty experience overall. I heard that the wait on the ribs was 30 minutes so I opted for their fried chicken which was crunchy greasy goodness. For a fairly quick bite I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I had to try it once but didn't enjoy the food much. I ordered a polish girl and a couple of pieces of fried chicken. I also went through the drive through which may have been a mistake as there was a bit of a long wait and confusion. Nothing too bad but not worth a repeat visit in my opinion."}
{"text":"I should have known this order would be wrong when I called and ordered wings and asked the young man who answered the phone \" how many sides cone with the wing dinner and he responded and said none.I told him your website says it conrs woth two sides...then he put me on hold and forgot I was on hold so I drove up to the drive Thur window.... Unprofessional!!!!! At least learn your menu...."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was wickedly delightful. They would get the fifth star but the restaurant needs some update and the staff needs to be more pleasant."}
{"text":"Driven past that ostentatious sign out front plenty of times but a little reluctant to stop and try their food. Should have definitely stopped by earlier.  2 words: FRIED CHICKEN. Ridiculously good. The chicken looked like it had been sitting under the heating lamp a little too long but it was super crunchy and super juicy. I have no clue what they put in it but who cares.  Mashed potatoes were awesome. A little runny for my taste but delicious goodness. Cole slaw was good but a little too much sauce and not enough crunch. Definitely have to get back there when I get a chance.   Order cafeteria style and if you don't know what you want they'll be happy to help you out. Then grab a seat and enjoy your meal. Strangely enough they have a vending machine in the dining area so I guess it really is like a cafeteria."}
{"text":"As a Clevelander this place is legendary! The location on E.125 is the best in my opinion. Chicken, ribs, polish boys, okra, mac n cheese, and the sauce!!! It's all good!!"}
{"text":"I love dives and this has it all: mauve and sea green walls and electric pink trim complete with what appears to be an empty domestic entertainment center. In the back is a smoker that looks like it's been converted from a WWII tank. The patron who was taking to everyone like he was on speed (but apparently wasn't because he was chowing) felt the need to tell everyone \"it's all about the sauce, any moron can fry chicken, I can fey chicken, this place is all about the sauce.\"  I ordered the rib and chicken dinner with fries and coleslaw. They asked me if I wanted sauce on everything and I got the sense  that, that was the thing to do, so I did. While the sauce is quite tasty, it's way on the sweet side. Definitely overkill having my fries swim in it. Next time I will opt for the black-eye peas. The chicken had a nice crunch and the sauce went well with it's greasiness and the ribs were fall off the bone good.  It receives high marks for being one of the messiest meals I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"You can't place a phone order after 5 pm. You have to go there and sit forever waiting on your order. I've decided to just go to B&M's."}
{"text":"Hotsauce Williams is a small little BBQ joint located on Carnegie in Cleveland, Ohio.   The food: Absolutely delicious. I have never had a single item I did not love from Hotsauce Williams. While the quality of some of the food isn't top notch, it TASTES amazing. The fries seem like they're frozen, but when they're drenched in the house BBQ sauce they taste great. The slaw is absolutely delicious, and I don't even like coleslaw. All the meats are delicious as well. What it really comes down to is the fact that everything is smothered in their BBQ sauce, which is delicious. I give the food itself a 4 out of 5.  The service: the staff is sometimes very apathetic and slightly rude. There's a lot of young people working there, maybe relatives of the owner, I can't say, that don't really seem to care about their job or whether or not they're giving you good service. I have heard many people complain about the staff there, though I've never personally had a problem with them. The demeanor of some of the younger workers is a little off-putting. I understand it's probably just a part time gig for them while they attend school or something, but it's good to have at least a decently positive attitude at work, especially when dealing with customers. This is balanced only by the owners friendly and happy personality. Every time I've seen him there he always asks me how I'm doing and makes a point to come over to my table and ask how the food is. I give the service a 3 out of 5.  The atmosphere: honestly this is not the cleanest place around, by any means. The place looks a little old and run down, which gives it a sort of mom and pop shop feel I suppose, but you would think they would put a little money into updating the building/decor a little bit. The place is sometimes packed, sometimes completely empty. They give you enough space for seating and the lighting is sufficient so that's a good thing. I give the atmosphere a 3 out of 5.  Overall I rate Hotsauce Williams at a 3.3 out of 5. This is not the place you go when you expect a five star meal where someone is gonna car park your car for you and give you a foot rub after you finish your slaw and fries. Not at all. This place is more about the food and for that reason I'll definitely be back again. I would recommend this restaurant to someone who really enjoys BBQ food and isn't too picky about service or atmosphere. Needless to say whether you're a native to Cleveland or the Greater Cleveland area, or whether you're just visiting from out of town you definitely have to check this place out at least once!"}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break and I waited for 20 minutes just for a polish boy! It was pretty good but waiting for the very slow and rude staff was frustrating."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place who knows how many times and between that sparking my curiosity, along with my bf taking about how good it is, I figured one of these days I need to give this place a go. Well, that go happened recently after moving the first batch of boxes into our new place.  Between carrying heavy boxes up a steep, long flight of stairs and just plain sweating off calories standing in the heat (gross, i know.  Sorry), I figured I would treat myself to this messy, greasy deliciousness.  And now I'm glad I did.   When we walked inside and I looked at the menu for the first time, I was a little overwhelmed - mainly because everything looked so good and I couldn't make up my mind on what to order.  But in all seriousness, they have quite a few combination platters to choose from, so ordering may take some time.  I settled on the fish, shrimp, and fry combo - the boyfriend went for the chicken, rib, fry combo.  Both were excellent choices.  Be sure to work on those biceps before you come here because the boxes of food they give you weigh a ton!  You get a massive amount of food for a great price, everything came out fresh and hot, and the sauce they pour over everything is AMAZING.  I was an overly stuffed/sauce all over face girl when we left, but it was absolutely worth it.  So don't wait as long as I did to get your grub on with some excellent BBQ because you need to know what you're missing out on.  Oh - and FYI - don't wear anything nice or white to this place.  And if you have young children you might want to borrow one of their bibs because the eating is quite messy."}
{"text":"I love the wings and the sauce just tops it off the best. I'll be going back next weekend for sure."}
{"text":"Despite being slathered in their sauce, this fried chicken surprisingly maintains its crispiness and isn't the least bit overpowered by the flavors of the sauce. Actually, the sauce compliments the chicken so well that it had me asking for more- I even bought a bottle of their original sauce for the road since we were just visiting Cleveland. Of the two sides that were ordered, the mac n cheese tastes similar to a homemade baked dish packed with cheesy goodness. The fried okra was decent, but was coated in so much batter that I could barely taste the okra. In addition to the good food, the service is also worth mentioning- everyone behind the counter was hospitable and made for a great first visit to Hot Sauce Williams"}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had the laziest service. We ended up throwing 35 dollars in the trash. If you like getting sick or experience all time lows check this place out!"}
{"text":"My bf ordered a polish boy dinner(7.99) he corrected him 3 times that's it's a polish boy combo not dinner. He wanted sauce on his polish boy (60 cents) I ordered a wing dinner (8.49) I wanted Mac and cheese with the dinner (1.49) I wanted sauce on my chicken and wings (1.25) the dinner comes with a beverage I wanted bottled water (1.25) ... That was the last straw I asked why was there a fee for water when it comes with a beverage he told me if I wanted I could have a cup of water ... I politely declined and left. I'll pass next time I'll go to B&M"}
{"text":"Mo was the manager/server.  She was excellent.  I was visiting my hometown and had to take my other non-locals here to experience the BEEF polish boy.  I ordered the Perch Dinner with Double Fries....gotta have the sauce on the fries.  It was excellent, as always.  Great crust to the perch.  A lot of fish for 8.95.    We were treated to desserts, such as sweet potato  pies.....homemade pies, not that frozen mess.  I couldn't eat all of my food.  Really nice sized order.  The BBQ sauce is the best.....but the packets of hot sauce are no good.  Stick with their homemade , signature SAUCE."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I been dying to try this place for sometime, but never found the motivation to go until we saw the Anthony Bourdain episode when he was in Cleveland. We ordered the Family Meal (Full Slab, 8 Pcs of Chicken and 2 sides). When we ordered most of the sides were not available so our choices were limited.  I've seen their slogan around town \"Voted #1 for Ribs\" so we were excited, but after taking our first bite into those saucy ribs, we looked at each other and said \"meh\" as we have had better. The chicken on the other hand, drenched in BBQ sauce, was interesting. It was saucy yet crispy so it was an interesting dish, we probably favor the chicken over the ribs. The family meal is large so make sure you have plenty of mouths to feed, as for us we'll need to hit the gym for the next several days to burn off the calories we just packed on."}
{"text":"I can see why this would be a neighborhood hangout: Everyone is friendly and seems to know each other; basketball games on the one TV so this hardly qualifies as a sports bar; and great food at reasonable prices. I had the Sunday dinner of brisket with three sides - candied yams, black eyed peas, and fried okra - wonderful. My only complaint is no beer and water comes in communion sized glasses."}
{"text":"1st time visitor. Portions were great and the personable service really gave it that home feel. Had the Rib Tip....my oh my, shut my mouth.  What was that devine creation?  Go get you some now! Good food + nice price = great atomphsere.  Enjoyed learning their history via the cook during her lunch break. You know if Samuel Jackson and Charlie Sheen dine there it's gotta be good."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today to get a chicken wing dinner for my wife.  After it took this young lady 10 minutes to take my my order.  She tells me its going to be a few minutes on the wings to cook.  So I had time to look around at all the celebrities to visit this staple in Cleveland.  I also had time to see how ran down and dirty this place was.  Dirty tables, floors, and walls.  Ceiling falling apart.  It's obvious they don't put money back into this dilapidated falling building.  30 minutes past I finally get my order.  The older lady gives me my order.  I asked don't I get a drink with my platter.  She told me it doesn't come with a drink.  I know the last time I was here I got the same thing and I got a drink with my food.  Matter fact this time I got coleslaw.  Last time I didn't.   Bottom line I'm all for supporting my community, but if you can't do better I'm taking my money elsewhere. But I'll give you another star because my food was good."}
{"text":"The Rib Dog sandwich was an interesting dish that consisted of two of the juiciest, best tasting ribs I've ever eaten wedged between two hot dog buns.  The sides were a slaw that wasn't two wet which sat well since the fries and ribs were drizzled with the establishment's famous sauce.  The sauce was zesty but not too spicy.  Having grown up eating barbecue in South Carolina, Hot Sauce Williams is a place that can scratch my itch."}
{"text":"Gut rot. 1/4 meat, 1/4 fat, 1/2 sauce, that pretty much sums up the ribs at HSW. Not the cleanest place I've ever been. It's not good...at all. Yech!"}
{"text":"This place was extremely unorganized. Orders came out slowly and at least half of it was wrong. The air conditioning must have been broken on our visit because it was over 90 degrees in the dining area. The food was pretty good and the only thing keeping this review from getting a one star. We ordered the rib tip sandwich but they came back 15 minutes later and said they were out so we ended up getting the pulled pork. While the food was good ( I would I say 8 out of 10) it wasn't nearly good enough to overcome the disappointment. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Cleveland... best barbecue sauce in the world. I always take out-of-town visitors here and get a bunch of fried chicken to go.  My friends and I come here every few months to clog our arteries with the awesomeness that is Hot Sauce. The fried breading on the chicken is so amazing that I inhale it into my stomach every time... the chicken is so moist and tender that it melts in my mouth... the sauce is so flavorful and unique that I put it on everything. Yes, the location is ghetto... the ambiance is ghetto... the service can be unreasonably slow at times. But the food is what keeps me coming and what gives HSW 4 stars.  Overall, if you want legit fried chicken in Cleveland, I highly recommend Hot Sauce Williams."}
{"text":"I was going to do 1 word to describe this, but couldn't decide between YUCK, GROSS or DISGUSTING!  Take your  pick.  I'm going to go throw up now."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that this place did not live up to the Man V. Food hype. I think I have been to better buffets before.  Terrible customer service earned them one out five stars. Extremely rude and inconsiderate server. Took us ten minutes to place our order when at the front of the line. She decided to have side conversations while we were still ordering.  Food: I ordered the Polish Boy and Dark Meat Chicken.   Polish Boy: Polish Sausage, Coleslaw, Fries, and BBQ sauce on a bun. It was drenched in sauce, making the bun soggy. It was not bad but was not all that. The sauce is not very good for BBQ. It is runny like Open Pit and has a little zing to it. Adam Richman was high when he said this sauce was incredible.  Chicken: Very good chicken, dark meat. The breading was very crispy and the meat was juicy. I enjoyed this part of the meal.  Overall, I would not return. No place should treat their guests with such arrogance and ineptness. I think I would rather take my money to Popeye's, its most comparable match."}
{"text":"Hot Sauce Williams has some pretty poor BBQ, mediocre fried chicken, and an odd sauce that they'll put on either one.  Of course then there's the polish boy. I'll explain.  This place has become a Cleveland landmark, probably more from visits of Anthony Bourdain and ManVFood than anything else.   There are a number of similar spots in Cleveland and you have to respect it for what it is.  It's not the kind of place that's trying to win competitions here.  It's more of a fast-food style cheap BBQ.  On our most recent visit we got a polish boy and some fried chicken.  A polish boy is a kielbasa, fries, coleslaw, and sauce on a bun.  It's an unrefined mess and it's pretty tasty.  In my opinion their chicken is so-so.  The service seems to be down to business.  I wouldn't describe my experiences as overly friendly.  If you're an out-of towner I suggest trying it for what it is.  The polish boy is uniquely Cleveland.  The neighborhood is characteristic for much of the east side of the city.  It may not be pretty but it is what it is."}
{"text":"My fiancé and her friend got food poisoning last night. They ordered the beef ribs... Not fun and not good. I got the fried chicken which was great and i feel ok. Service is kind of shitty like other reviews have said, some people are just not positive. I guess i wouldn't be working at a BBQ place till 1:30 in the morning. I will NOT be going back. Food poisoning is a really bad thing, which means they aren't doing proper food handling."}
{"text":"The chicken was good, not the greatest in the world but definitely in the top 5. The chicken was crispy, moist, and it had a tangy-Chinese chicken like taste.   Ribs were ribs, not bad, not amazing. Candied yams and collard greens, same deal.  Also had the Polish Boy, probably will never eat that again. Not because it tasted bad (it was better than I expected), but because it was just too much soul all in one package (fries, sauce, and very creamy cole slaw slabbed onto a beef dog).   All in all, if I were to do it again I would just get the chicken wings, sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed.  It wasn't bad, but not worth the hype surrounding this place.  I thought that the best thing that I had was the coleslaw. I don't like coleslaw.    It wasn't terrible by any means, but the ribs were not nearly as tender as they should be for a place that is \"famous\" for them.  I grew up and Cleveland, and somehow never tried it, always thinking I could go later, and when I found i was moving, I was worried when I went there I would love it, and hate myself for not going there all the time.  Luckily I was wrong, and have had better ribs all over the country."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by here to try the Polish girl sandwich featured on Man vs. Food.  The sandwich was tasty but the service is terrible.   Like others have said in there reviews, the service is extremely slow.  The waitresses walk slow, talk slow, and were inattentive.  It also took almost 30 minutes to get one polish girl and fish sandwich (because they ran out of the popcorn shrimp my friend wanted...) which is pretty slow to me.  Our waitress even disappeared during the middle of our service and it took us a extra 20 minutes to get our bill after we were done.  The restaurant is also an eyesore, the pink and light blue color scheme is even more offensive to the eyes in person.  I won't ever come here again but if you plan to come here, order to go!"}
{"text":"The place gets one star for being a barbecue joint, one star for good service, and one star for edible food.  Hey man on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. Order the rib tips combo with Coleslaw. There was plenty of meat on the rib tips, they easily pulled away from the bone, but the meet was very chewy. The barbecue sauce was a bit tangy, like an open pit type sauce. Typically I'm not a big fan of open pit, but this stuff complemented the rib tips nicely.  Had a side of coleslaw. It was a bit on the warm side and was nothing special. Actually had a bit of a twang to it. I'll be interested to see how I feel in an hour or two..."}
{"text":"It's great that they are still open. It seemed like they could never take a call in order. I haven't been there lately. Hopefully they can work hard at being successful. They should do some upgrading of their lobby and kitchen."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for BBQ and decided to go here because of the proximity to my house and the fact that they have been around forever. Worst idea ever. The pulled pork sandwich was disgusting. I took two bites and fed the rest to my dog. Rightfully so seeing as it tasted like dog food. The sandwich was overpriced. I was hoping for a side but they had no variety. The place looked like they need some serious updates to the inside and to their menu. I wouldn't recommend it and will never go back. There's too many other restaurants on Lee that deserve my money."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am not one to line-up to sample any food described as \"spicy\" or \"hot.\" Luckily, Hot Sauce Williams signature bbq sauce is not spicy as the name originally suggested to me.  I had the ribs, coleslaw, and french fries, all drizzled with the mild bbq sauce. As you might expect, this was a generous portion of smoky ribs and I did not even come close to finishing the meal. This was fine with me, because now I have leftovers for lunch! The rib dinner, combined with a Pepsi, totaled approximately $10. My friend purchased the chicken dinner (fried chicken) with mac and chees subbed for the coleslaw. Substitutions are a slight up-charge, but it seems worth it to me for home-style mac and cheese. She chose to have her bbq on the side. You must request this, otherwise that ladle of sauce drops on the fries and all. The three of our meals totaled around $30, and if I could make one suggestion to anyone reading this, it would be to try the \"family meal\" which seems to include an insane amount of food (I guess enough to feed a family) at only $28. It is probably a good thing that the 3 of us chose not to share the \"family meal\" as I don't think any of us need that much mac and cheese, ribs, and fried chicken! I was going to suggest that anyone thinking of ordering food for the first time visit the Hot Sauce Williams website but as I write this entry, their website does not seem to be active. Ordering may be a little confusing for a first time customer stepping up to the register as their menu is not clearly visible. However, if you come armed with the information I have given you, you should be all set. Get the family meal if you are ordering for a group ($28? Why not!). And if it is just for you, try the chicken dinner, coleslaw, and mac and cheese (slight up charge for the mac and cheese) with sauce on the side for approximately $10. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give them more stars but let's focus on the obvious:  The mac and cheese: Tasted like someone left it out under the heat lamp to the point it was fermenting. A very sweet taste to it...like it was off.  The chicken: It was ok and all but nothing special.  The Po Boy: It was good. Just nothing special really....meaning it doesn't take an iron chef or a recipe to be passed down to make that right.  Fries: Meh  Sauce: Really good but on rather bland and dry food, its just ok.   Atmosphere: Ghetto and cold (temperature and vibe).   I would like to give them another shot, but, at best, that just means they are inconsistent if I like it next time......"}
{"text":"Pretty solid / cheap chow. But not BBQ Line moved fairly slow but i didn't expect fast food. Staff was polite and playful  I ordered the chicken/ribs combo. ($10) -The chicken was pretty tasty, but the sauce poured all over it made it instantly soggy. -the ribs are smoked/grilled then BAKED. that said they had good flavor and texture. -the sauce is just plain not good. tastes like sweetened tomato juice. it worked okay on the ribs but ruined the chicken. -mac n cheese is meh -greens are cooked sweet. not my style.  Def work a quick meal if you are in the area, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Hey now...this is good BBQ...for Cleveland!  It's definitely a down-and-dirty BBQ joint.  The interior is pink and blue--not exactly the most appetizing colors.  If they bother you that much, there's always the drive-thru.  When you walk in you tell the lady at the counter what you want (from the single sheet of paper on the counter that shows the menu).  She takes your money, and then you pick up your food at the other end of the counter.  It's kinda like a school cafeteria--food is under hot lamps and kept hot in foodservice trays.  Just about every booth in the restaurant has ripped and patched \"pleather.\"  Classic.  Service is very sllloooowwwww.    I had the pulled pork sandwich--tender pork nestled in between 2 slices of white Wonder bread and topped with a slathering of Williams' own bbq sauce and coleslaw.  And I got a small side of macaroni and cheese.  Both were very tasty.  We also got some fried chicken and that was damn good."}
{"text":"I know others have been moaning about their service, but our experience last Sunday was great.   We were disappointed about the dining room being closed, but the drive through was open and the staff were very patient with our endless debate about what to order (our son can be finicky). They even chimed in with recommendations when they told us that Fried Okra was unavailable.  The food was incredible -- and really messy in the car as we scarfed it down on our way back to NYC. We had Polish Girls, Mac and Cheese, Black-Eyed Peas and a Pork Shoulder sandwich. The sauce is really special.   We strongly recommend it to everyone. Great food, great service, really cheap."}
{"text":"The chicken was good, just good.  The hot sauce isn't 'all that', in my opinion.  The fries were nothing special and the mac and cheese was greasy.  The staff was not at all friendly or welcoming.  Oh, and since when is a chicken sandwich two pieces of chicken on the bone and two pieces of bread?  Take it off the bone and put it on the bread yourself?  Want the hot sauce on the side?  It's an extra 65 cents.  The coleslaw was okay.  Maybe other locations are better......"}
{"text":"As noted in my check in, this place has the BEST polish boys and wings. But they have terrible service. I try to support black-owned and love to seek out food places that are local to the cities that I visit, but there is a serious lack in service and standards of this restaurant.   My first time visiting, about a year ago, we foolishly decided to \"dine in\", which natives later told me was something to NEVER do. The dining area is very run down and service was terrible. Thank goodness the food was delicious, because it was turning out to be one of those experiences from hell.  Returned today for a polish boy before a concert and tried the \"drive-in\". The mic and menu were defunct, so we pulled to window, honked, and waited. The food came quickly, but again service left much to be desired. The ending highlight of this craptacular spectacle was us returning the paper menu to the worker, and him throwing it on the ground in front of us haha.  Go with very minimal expectations if you're up for a true Cleveland shenanigan!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken and ribs dinner with green beans and fries. All delicious. Pretty much as close to being in the south as you can get in Cleveland.  Served in foam carry out trays, fancy. The only thing lacking was the service but really I expected that."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype!  After seeing this location on Man vs Food I had to check it out for myself. I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions.   The place is definitely a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.  The employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her.   It took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would definitely call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.  The chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes. I'd much rather go to Zanzibar for their delicious honey fried chicken. Hell, I'll even take Church's Chicken instead!"}
{"text":"This place is oh so tasty!!  The great thing about their chicken is that, you don't even need their hot sauce for it to taste so good.  With the hot sauce, the chicken goes from good to great.  The pieces of chicken are typically big, hot, and filling.  Truly hit the spot if you're wanting a taste of the south, up here in Northeast Ohio.  The only problems I had with this place was that they close the dining room in the afternoon on Sunday (luckily they have the drive thru open) and the sides aren't seasoned well enough.  Overall, this place is must try place."}
{"text":"The location on 79th Carnegie, is a hot ghetto mess. I am ashamed of what the establishment has turned into. Maybe I'll try out superior or Lee rd."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome, it is in a pretty bad neighborhood and the dinning area isn't the most up to date. But the food definitely saves the day. If you are looking for a mounted menu, you won't find one. They have a paper menu on the front counter that has seen better days. The prices aren't bad and the selection is your standard, when it comes to a soul food spot. I ordered the 2 piece fried chicken meal, with sauce on the side (because I'm not the biggest fan of spicy). The chicken almost feels as though it was made tempura style, the crunch is very different but very good at the same time. The fries are your traditional crinkled cut, no standout seasonings were detected. I am not a fan of cole slaw so I donated mine to the trash can (seeing as though you cannot substitute sides). When I asked how much the can sodas were, the cashier replied \"man these suckers are expensive $1.50 a can.\" Being that I am a punk when it comes to spicy foods I had to purchase one. I was pleased to learn that the sauce isn't all that spicy and I could tolerate it with the help of the expensive soda. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Cleveland. Fried Chicken 1-5=5. Fries 1-5=3. Sauce 1-5=4."}
{"text":"Originally saw this place on Man vs. Food.  I definitely like the food here and everything is pretty good. The chicken, the ribs, the hot links, and the sides are delicious. I particularly like the po boy. I think it's something like a hot dog or hot link in a bun, topped with cole slaw, french fries, and covered in sauce. And it's around like $4 and some change. For less than $5, it's a value and really good.   If this place was a little closer, I would definitely come by more often"}
{"text":"Went late evening...door was locked this time. (Wasn't locked the last evening I went.) Parking lot full of cars that's not at restaurant. So I go to the drive thru, there's a piece of card board on the speaker that says nothing (very unprofessional.) Sat there a few minutes not knowing what to do. Went to the drive thru and placed order there. Prices were a lot more than the prices listed on line which is what I was prepared to pay.   Between the drive thru speaker and not keeping up on current prices on their website, seems like they just don't care. So for now on I don't care to patron. I'll take my business elsewhere to someplace that shows the customer they care and stay professional. I'm not going to keep patronizing places that doesn't have any sort of professionalism about them. There are tons of restaurants of there!"}
{"text":"The polish girl was good overall but the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. The fried chicken was also a plus."}
{"text":"I walked in just after 11 a.m. on a Friday. The lunch rush hadn't happened yet, and the place had a sprinkling of customers. I wasted little time in ordering their Polish Boy ($3.99): a deep-fried spicy kielbasa is placed on a bun, topped with cole slaw, french fries, and their house-made sauce.  Deep fryers do such awesome things to food. I enjoyed the snap of the kielbasa here. The sauce and the creamy slaw packed great flavor -- and made this Polish Boy a bit messy. I don't think I had crinkle fries since my elementary school days, so a bit of nostalgia there. I ate my food in the car, so I felt compelled to bring out my \"namby-pamby\" side and eat it with a fork. The bun could have used some toasting, but that's my personal preference.  I didn't get many smiles from the staff when ordering. Not sure if it was just too early for the crew, or if they were just too busy getting everything ready for later, but I feel that a lack of flashing pearly whites must be mentioned here.  Hot Sauce Williams has a multitude of delectable offerings. It's too bad I only had a short time to enjoy this experience. Hopefully I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"It's a no-atmosphere soul food joint.  You're going to be lucky if the staff doesn't actively mock you before shoving the food across a sticky counter in your general direction.    Thus, there is but one reason to come here: the food.    As you can see from my quintuple-star review, that food is reason enough.    Cleveland is superior to Detroit in many ways, but Detroit generally whups us when it comes to good, stick-to-your-ribs soul food.  Thankfully, this will do quite nicely.    The fried chicken is amazing - a light, crispy crust that's so tasty you could strip it off and eat it on its own, the chicken cooked to a juicy perfection.  The ribs are a little tough - though that's a style issue, they make them that way on purpose because some folks like chewy ribs (I prefer fall-off-the-bone), and there's not a lot of bark on 'em.    Fortunately, they will ask you at the counter: \"You want the sauce?\"  Hell yes you want the sauce,  Peppery without being blatantly hot, flavorful, why the hell did you come to HOT SAUCE WILLIAMS if you don't want the sauce?   Might as well go to Six Flags America and not buy a flag.    Anyway, the mac and cheese is soft but flavorful (no broiled crust, alas, which would bring it to perfection) and sticky with real cheese.  The mashed potatoes are saturated with butter, and a little chunky.  The candied yams are a little dry - I won't lie - but still nice enough to gobble through.   And it's cheap.  $9.99 will get you enough to last you through lunch and dinner.    If you're looking for haute cuisine, well, maybe the hideous pink building should have warned you off.  You come here as a food ninja - you sneak in, snatch the chicken from the master's hand, and get the hell out with a full belly.  It works."}
{"text":"There wings are 1.50 a piece and small I ask for fresh ones she told me no I see y they always close and dont make any money They rude ghetto the beef polish boy cold fries cold sauce nasty"}
{"text":"Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland institution... Put in other words- you have to try this place at least once.   The sauce isn't for everyone. It's a vinegar based sauce with a little heat to it. I absolutely LOVE it but I know others who prefer a thicker sauce. I normally go with the 2 piece all white dinner with the sauce on everything. The fried chicken is some of the best in Cleveland. The fries, slaw and bread are all solid and for what you pay ($6.99 for my meal) you get a ton of food. The inside of the restaurant is very old school-- definitely not a place for suits and ties. It has a drive thru which is super convenient, especially considering the area it is in."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! I got the pork plate which is shoulder with slaw and bread covered in sauce. Came with fries that I had them add sauce to. Just amazing. I've had bbq so many ways and I appreciated how unique and delicious this spot was!"}
{"text":"It seems they care about their food. Tried a polish boy (it's food, I swear). It had great taste but messier than a Hollywood divorce..with kids. Couldn't be happier with the hot sauce, chicken and ribs. Ton of food for a little money. No public restrooms, fake flowers on pink tablecloths in an old fast food joint. They still yell their orders to the back. So why are they on the travel channel? They actually care about their food."}
{"text":"I love Hot Sauce Wiliams. Well, I love their food. Their service is very hit or miss.  Though HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ.   Where HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.  For drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer  Though I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.  If I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.  If you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment."}
{"text":"Best soul food I've ever had...this restaurant is one of the must-visit attractions of Cleveland. Best cole slaw I've ever had and the fried chicken dinners are one of a kind. You have to try it to believe it!"}
{"text":"Used to go here and the food was good, tried again after not having it for awhile and I should have kept driving past. The food was AWFUL. They changed the sauce...... taste like ketchup and sweet and sour sauce mixed together. It was disgusting. Just a disaster. Will NEVER go back to ANY hot sauce williams location."}
{"text":"Um, can I just say that I want another 15 orders? This stuff is so so delicious. It has had rave reviews from all sorts of TV shows and I had to try. So last night, after a full weekend of eating, I decided I could just put on some super loose eating pants and go and get my fill.   We ordered the rib tip meal and the thigh snack. The rib tips were well cooked and the SAUCE! That is the winning ingredient. The ribs themselves were a little bit tough at times, but that sauce is really what makes your mouth water. We also got the macaroni and cheese as a side and as a not usual fan of mac and cheese (I KNOW, I'm the devil for saying such ludicrous things) I wasn't expecting to finish the ENTIRE tub by myself. My boyfriend wished he acted faster, because he just got a small taste.   What you have to be careful about when you go late at night is that they close the doors and you have to order in the drive through. The intercom doesn't work so you drive up to the window and order. They take about 5 to 8 minutes to get your order. During that time, there will be homeless people that approach you. If that's not your scene, you won't score some awesome ribs. The environment its in is not great, but the food will surely make you want to come back."}
{"text":"By far the greatest place to visit. Been a fan for twenty years and until you come here you aint had real BBQ"}
{"text":"If you don't like this place, chances are you don't know what good barbeque is.  I had the rib tip dinner (Off menu btw). This is a good alternative to the full rib dinner. It is still a ton of food, but not quite as much! The sauce is delicious.  As of 27 Feb 2011, you get a free plastic Pepsi 'Courtesy Cup' if you buy any one of their sodas.  Yes it's dirty, informal and right in the middle of an extremely sketchy neighborhood. IMO Cleveland needs more places like this. There are way too many places that wish with all of their might to be located in Manhattan or LA. Guess what? You're in Cleveland. Now ditch the valet and the uppity atmosphere, and give me some food."}
{"text":"Where do I start....My family & I went here on Saturday night and ordered 2-4 piece chicken dinners & 1-2 piece chicken dinner.  We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait!!!  The chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh, drumstick coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about  heaven!!!! You can get the sauce on the side though if you're not too adventurous.   Now the service, that's another story.  Let me just say they need a tutorial on  customer service.  I'm a person who believes in second chances, so we tried this place again on Sunday and the service was the same....The only thing that changed was the table cloths?.....The reason why I gave this place a 4 star is because of the food but the service could use a lot of upgrading!!!  I would suggest that you call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food, it's like watchin' paint dry!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for sure. I'm always willing to drive out here for a polish boy or short ribs. I'm not a fan of coleslaw, but theirs is top notch! They give you white bread with your ribs- my friend who lived in the south was very naustalgic about this. Great place, always get your fries with sauce!  It is NOT cash only- you just need to have an ID and be the person the card belongs to"}
{"text":"Got takeout from here last night.  The good: The Po Boy is solid.  Very tasty, as was the Mac N Cheese  The decent: Chicken Sandwich -  Just so you know, as we learned, a chicken sandwich here is simply fried chicken on the bone with two slices of wonder bread.  So hence, not really a chicken sandwich.  The skin could have been crispier, it seemed a bit too spongy, maybe old oil?  Not sure, but it was just ok.  The sauce that comes with it is more of a tomato based typed hot sauce, sort of a mix between hot sauce, tomato sauce and bbq sauce which I liked, but my wife didn't care for.  The Green Beans were average.  The bad:  No sweet tea, the tea they have is a can of Nestea.  Also the drive thru service left much to be desired, the person taking the order was hard to understand and a bit rushed. The food did come out quickly however."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fried chicken and found the ribs to be rather tasty. I love soul food!"}
{"text":"As a former resident of the city I was hoping to get a polish boy Cleveland style that would get me through until I return. Not here. I give a lot of leeway for rib joints but if I could give 0 stars and still review, I would. Never again. I mean how hard is it to put a fresh polish boy in a bun top with fresh fries some sauce and coleslaw??? For hot sauce Williams it must be an astronomical feat. All the time standing around the should be cleaning etc. but not. If I get sick I'm calling the health department. Someone should anyway. So very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"First off, yes this place is pretty ratchet and in a sketchy neighborhood. If you can get past that, its definitely worth a stop. I had the polish girl, with the pulled pork. The pork itself was kind of tasteless, the BBQ sauce kind of overpowered everything for me. The sauce was also a little too spicy for my liking, but not terrible. The mac and cheese was mediocre. There are other better dive restaurants here in cle for BBQ, but this place isn't terrible."}
{"text":"I wish there was a no star button. After buying a wing dinner last night I spent this morning sick as a dog. I don't know what's happened to this place over the years but they need to go ahead and close the doors!"}
{"text":"I am a Cleveland resident. I have been to Hot Sauce Williams many times and I would normally describe it as being just okay. It is a decent rib and chicken joint but I've been to many that are better. I only go there because I don't have a car and it is right near a city bus stop.  I visited on Friday and I must say I was extremely disappointed. When I arrived there a woman was standing in line. I sat down because it was very hot and I wanted to rest for a second before I ordered. I asked my boyfriend to go find us a menu. The woman who was in line suddenly became angry. She yelled \"I guess no one's gonna help me.  I've been standing here for 10 minutes. I'll take my money elsewhere\". She stormed out angrily. My boyfriend then came back stating that he could only find the second page of a menu (which only showed family meal deals). We looked over it but found that none of the items were good for just two people so we took the menu back to the front counter. We stood there for about 10 minutes when finally a worker walked up to the counter and rudely said \"What?\". We asked could we get the other page of the menu to which he replied. \"Nah. That's all we got\" and walked away. During our time there we witnessed 2 other customers treated the same both of which left.   We remembered Uber existed and we caught an Uber to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Considering \"Gin\" or Aunt Gin as I call her since she is the sister of my grandfather (Beasley/Williams) and is the owner of this restaurant, I have to give our family restaurant a perfect score. The sauce should be bottled its so good and one thing for sure, our quality of food has never changed since day one (see Whitmore's if you disagree). This restaurant is a pink building located in the \"hood\" of Cleveland, OH but no one gets \"gangsta\" around the Bar B Q...it's just not Kosher! I always loved their ribs. No games, lots of meat and plenty of sauce with little attitude about it! Prices are general $7 - $10 dinners, $6 - $8 sandwich meals. Cleveland is the only city that serves barbeque fries which is when they take deep fried French fries and drench them in barbeque sauce....ummmm good!  Hot Sauce Williams is the best, but then again anything produced by my family I will deem as the best.                                     ***Buyer beware of the \"Itis\" ***"}
{"text":"I've been going to Hot Sauce Williams for the past 15 years and this place is going down hill big time!  The service continues to get worse and the attitude of the workers is piss poor.  They ignore you and can be very rude as well.  Also, the place is very dirty and I would love to see the health inspection report.    I will admit there Sauce is some of the best I have ever had.  The wings are just not as good as they used too, but the Polish Boy is still very good.  The Mac n Cheese is very overrated and DO NOT ORDER THE RIBS.  They are like chowing down on a gristled piece of fat and that has the texture of rubber.  My friend tossed them away they were so bad.    Very sad to see an Cleveland Institution goes down the tubes like this and hope they can improve but that's the last they have seen of my business.    P.S-Don't even bother going through the drive thru unless you have 20 mins to spare, no joke."}
{"text":"Hot Sauce Williams is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine :) My favorite dish from here is the fried chicken and ribs dinner. For sides, I get the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. They give you sooooo much food for just under $12!   The servers work only behind the food stand, so you pretty much have to clean off the tables yourself. You may at first be deterred from this place by its lack of cleanliness, but the food is so worth it!  One thing to keep in mind, they don't provide free water, but a bottle of water is only $1.   Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of buzz about this place, especially given its feature on the Food Network. Having lived in New Orleans for some time, I was both curious and eager to give HSW a try. (New Orleans is famous for some of its fried/comfort foods.)  The Bottom Line: this place is rather magical. If you love fried food that is slathered in hot sauce, then this is your place. To be honest, the fried food offers a one-dimensional taste experience; however, the food presentation is beautiful...in an ordered-chaos sort of way.  There's a menu, but you pretty much just get whatever they have available (I.e., whatever is sitting in the warmers behind the counter). I tried the fried chicken and the famous Polish Boy sandwich -- a fried kielbasa topped with coleslaw, fries, and hot sauce. I also \"sauced\" everything, allowing the kind worker to paint all of my food with the ever-so-sweet-tangy-and-delicious HSW hot sauce. The food was hot, and amazingly, the chicken was as crispy/tasty as some of the famous fried chicken of New Orleans' Willie Mae's Scotch House and Dooky Chase. (Huge success!)  The decor is the best part of HSW. The restaurant is appears to be a bit rundown, ostensibly dirty, and some of the windows are adorned with iron bars/mesh for safety purposes. While this may seem to be a negative, it is not. These details, coupled with the ambiance of the restaurant's neighborhood, offer the adventurous and hungry an authentic City of Cleveland dining experience.  Grade: A"}
{"text":"Went a few months ago and was not impressed. We read many great reviews but we did not have the same experience. They were out of ribs and other items so we settled and the food was sloppy and not very tasty. We left and ended up finding something to eat."}
{"text":"The chicken isn't what makes this place great.  It's good but it becomes something different entirely when you smother it in the signature sweet, juicy sauce.  My God, I'd smother my limbs in this and eat my own arms.  It's that good.  Get that and some of the mac n cheese and you're in heart attack heaven.  But it's so good you won't care!  Also, all this crap about \"Oh i might get shot\" or \"Don't venture here at night\".  This is Cleveland, kids.  It's rough.  But I'd rather venture into a rough neighborhood than spend my time kickin' it at Applebee's in the safety and comfort of some designed suburb eating crap ass Jack Daniel glazed \"riblets.\"  Do yourself a favor, venture out of your comfort zone and get some good chicken...and extra sauce  You'll be super happy you did."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna say that I hated it...but, it was close.  My husband and I were I Cleveland to see the Raiders play the Browns. We decided to eat at this restaurant, seeing that we love man vs. food and Adam seems like he has good taste.   We pulled up, and the outside of the building was old...like really old. But, we're from a small town, and we know some of the best food is served in the strangest places. So, we decided to give it a shot. We walked in...and it was a pink explosion. They had everything from pink walls, to pink tablecloths.  Even after that, we thought...\"Okay, we can get past decor'. We're not fancy people, we just want some really good food.\" We were hoping that the food/service would make up for the atmosphere. However, we didn't even think we would ever revive food, considering that we sat for 25 minutes before our order was even taken.  When our waitress FINALLY got done checking on all her 3 other tables, cleaning, stocking, checking the kitchen, and anything else she could think of, we finally placed our order. Which was a miracle seeing that the menus were hard to read. By that time, two MASSIVE (I'm talking aunts, cousins, kids, grandma, the works)families walked in.   Instead of turning people away, politely explaining that there was no room to seat them, they let them stand in the dining room, waiting for seats. We literally had people crowded around our table standing...it was severely uncomfortable. Not to mention the noise level with all of those people in the same small space.  When our food got to our table, it was good. It was VERY good. My husband loved the ribs, and my chicken was to die for. However, it was wasted on the atmosphere. There was no possible way they could have made food good enough (delicious as it was) to make up for the time, energy, and experience we had. We both left with a headache.   If you want some good food, you can find it there. But, you're gonna want to call in a carry-out order."}
{"text":"You've probably driven past their hideously ugly pink and blue building hundreds of times and have never stopped in. Well, you should remedy that.   I'm not big on this type of food at all. I would never in a million years order ribs because I don't like to get barbecue sauce on my face. I like healthier more inventive food, snobbier food maybe? But damn, Hot Sauce Williams is good. KFC or whoever has NO business using \"finger lickin' good\" -- I think HSW should steal it.   My family was all about going to the rib cook-off yesterday. When it started to pour nobody wanted to go anymore. Hot Sauce Williams was our next choice. We were very happy that it rained.   I ordered the fried chicken and rib dinner. I couldn't NOT have ribs at HSW. It came with 2 sides. I chose collard greens (of course) and cole slaw. My brother and I also split a pork shoulder sandwich (cuz we're fatties). Yep, the one that was featured on No Reservations. Everything was very tasty. The fried chicken was the best I'd ever had. I can't say I've actually eaten that type of fried chicken many places before but it was so effing good that I wanted to make out with it.   My only complaint with HSW was the girl working the register. She could have been more polite, maybe even a tiny bit personable, or perhaps ... I dunno....helpful? and not a complete bitch? We were almost afraid of her.   I'll be back for sure. I just hope the Trunchbull isn't working."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Nooooo!   In the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items.   Granted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else.   G Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?).   The fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.    The buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served.   The sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be).   It isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a \"Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant\" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname.   The service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread.   Sort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks.   I'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to do with this place... A couple of my friends took me here; they said they come here every now and then and enjoy it. But...  when they took my friend and I, I was a little less than underwhelmed. We were the only four people in the place (except for one guy who came in and tried to sell us pirated DVDs) and I was the last to order, but by the time my catfish dinner arrived everyone else had already finished their food. It took them almost 25 minutes to make my food. So for 25 minutes I had a good long look at their heat lamps. I watched several flies and fruit flies land, fly around, and then re-land on the coleslaw and fries. Needlessness when my food actually did come up, I was in no hurry to eat either of those two sides I had gotten. I will admit that the catfish itself was tasty, but the atmosphere completely took my appetite away. The one garbage can in the dining area was overflowing with food bits and dozens of fruit flies, so when we decided to leave (about 5 minutes after my food came), I had to take mine to go, but then my friends had to just set their garbage next to the overflowing trashcan because there were no employees in sight. Also, the parking lot and surrounding area was super sketchy. If the catfish hadn't have tasted alright, this place would have only gotten one star."}
{"text":"The first time I had hot sauce Williams I didn't understand the sizes. So between 3 people we ordered like $40 worth of chicken on our way from cleveland to Columbus. By the time we got there, all the chicken was gone. I have never eaten a tastier chicken in my life"}
{"text":"I'm so tired of this place not paying attention to simple instructions. I always order my food with light sauce and they always PILE it on.  I'm sorry but at some point I would really like to be able to actually taste my food."}
{"text":"I had always seen this place growing up, but I never actually tried it until this past Christmas! The fried chicken was probably the best I have ever had; worth every calorie! I had the sweet potato fries and they were great and crispy.  Everyone was really nice; the cook even came out and took a photo with us when I told him that I was visiting and had always wanted to try the place! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a rib diner. The presentation was lacking to say the least. The ribs, fries, and bread were stuffed in an undersized box and drenched with sauce (everything had sauces on it and a lot). Because of the small box it made eating difficult and not very enjoyable.   Personally I like my ribs cooked low and slow in a smoker; these ribs didn't appear to be cooked that way. Nonetheless, the ribs were tender with good flavor. Additionally I thought the meal was fairly priced with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Impromptu trip to Cleveland that my boyfriend planned himself. First place he surprised me with was stopping here :). We had the polish boy hot dog- that was featured on man vs food. First let me point out that the polish girl is the hot dog featured on man vs food- although they call it a polish boy. ANYWAY... It was amazingggg. One all beef hog topped with coleslaw, their own tangy hot sauce with some BBQ flavors as well, fresh cut fries and pulled pork.... I didn't think I could eat the entire thing when I saw it- it was huge! But I loved it so much I engulfed it entirely! The sauce is the best. I had to actually go back in and get more sauce to go.   Their fried chicken looked incredible so I HAD to try it- I just ordered three wings in order to see how it was. The breading on the outside of the wings was incredible- they weren't too crunchy and almost tasted beer battered.. Amazing.   We had awesome customer service- everyone was helpful and friendly.   I read some reviews and saw that some people were afraid to eat here and suggested drive thru... I guess that depends on when you go. I went on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed so we couldn't eat in the restaurant- but I would have gladly. There weren't any sketchy characters at all, everyone was friendly. There are sketchy people no matter where you go , so don't let any negative reviews like that turn you away from this place! I loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"oh God....I think this may be my first review where I add the tag line \"for Cleveland\"....I'm so sorry that I have to use it here...  So, this is decent BBQ....for Cleveland.  Decided to commemorate MLK Day and a former Yelper by patronizing Hot Sauce Williams.  We had both been wanting BBQ all day long and figured today was just a good a day as any to give it a shot.  Reading the previous reviews, I found it quite funny that we wound up getting the exact same thing as Amy T. and her dining partner!  Ribs, coleslaw and fries for me...4 pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese and fries for my gluttonous dining partner ;o)  But, getting to the point of ordering was an ordeal in itself!  We walked in and there were no menus posted....looking around for a couple of minutes, I was almost ready to go up to the girl behind the counter and ask her \"so, what do you think we should get\"...but I was kind of afraid to do that because of the response I envisioned in my head *cringe*.  So, I was pretty thankful when we finally looked around and found some printed up menus of their offerings....but, in what kind of order did they put these things?  There was no rhyme or reason to half of the menu, very confusing.  Ordering was an event in itself, I started ordering with one girl and then she just walked away in the middle of my order, and then another chick came up and kind of finished it....I mean, I agree with Stef C. on this one, would it kill you to put a smile on your face and actually act like you enjoy getting paid??  Pluses, it was cheap, and it was fast, we had our food in less than 5 minutes and were out the door to enjoy it at home.  Portions were HUGE, holy crap you could feed a family of four on the two dinners we ordered, neither of us could finish our meals.  Sauce was decent, ribs were a little grisly, chicken was pretty good....but in all reality, eating BBQ in Texas and Georgia has ruined me.  HSW is decent BBQ, for Cleveland.....this place would be out of business so fast in any of the Southern states due to the attitude you receive behind the counter and for the simple fact that it's just not that great when compared to some of the great BBQ places around the country.    Let's just say I think my BBQ craving is over until summer comes around and all the Yelpers can get together and do a proper cookout."}
{"text":"Finally decided to see what all the hype was about and ended up pretty disappointed. First of all, I love hole in wall restaurants. I can tolerate a lot if the food is worth it but I'm not sure this is the case. This place is just filthy and unkept. Service, while friendly, is totally unorganized and slow. I noticed a cook walking around the kitchen in socks ¯\_(?)_/¯  The dining room is a disaster. Again, filthy with no ac or airflow. They were out of ribs and pulled pork so we tried the polish boy and fried chicken. The chicken was good but had been under the lamps for too long and the Polish boy was just some BBQ sauced slop. I really wanted to like this place but if they don't even want to pretend like they care about cleanliness or food quality and ride that tv hype I won't be back."}
{"text":"I thought this was a made to order establishment , but the food is prepared in advance and sitting on warmers like at a buffet. I was disappointed by that because the prices are kind of high compared to similar establishments that  cook to order.  The food was just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again especially since the sides that I had aren't homemade.  The service was average. Nothing more, nothing less. The building could stand to be updated or at least change the lighting."}
{"text":"I shamlessly admit to straining that tin foil that comes with my rib order like a rag to get more of that tasty bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Went for the second time on Thursday 7/29/2010, and Danielle, the completely indifferent cashier dropped the ball on my order, and I had to wait 40 minutes to get a bloody catfish sandwich  Don't get me wrong, fried catfish was outstanding, but being treated like trash will insure I don't return, which is unfortunate because I am very loyal to my favorite eateries.  Below was my first experience.  I'd heard good things about this place on Yelp, and it was okay.  I had the fried chicken, which was actually pretty good. I regret letting them douse my chicken and fries in the bbq sauce though. There's something that just doesn't gel with fried and bbq chicken. I really did enjoy my mostly sugar orange-pineapple drink. The coldslaw was boring.  The ambiance was nice, but the server(s) who took my take out order couldn't have given two craps about customer service. I'll give it one more in the hopes that my experience will be redeemed.  The food came out relatively quickly though."}
{"text":"Location: sketchy  Service: cold (like we were bothering them) ; drive thru speaker didn't work so had to remember order at window (a little difficult as first timer)  Food: polish boy was delicious !!! Rib tips were ok   Though the polish boy was very good , it does not out weigh the shady area and unwelcoming service."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken out there. Skip the hot sauce, it isn't hot, and is frankly pretty disgusting. The various sides on offer are mediocre. There is a high likelihood of there being no food in the restaurant, especially later in the day, so call before going. Seems like it's takeout only in spite of having a large restaurant space."}
{"text":"This is one screwed up place. Take your food . But they won't have what you want. put some out of the bottle hot sauce on it and serve it with crappy service. And over price it by about twice what it should be. There ya go. Went twice. Sames stuff different day."}
{"text":"Painful to watch this slow disorganized mess try to handle just a few orders at once. Took 30 minutes to get our food and that was because we accepted other chicken pieces than what we ordered because they said it would take longer. Short story long: if you're in a hurry this isn't the place for you.  On a positive note; the ribs were very good even with a little too much of their hot sauce on them. But the ribs weren't incredibly meaty. The chicken was nicely fried, but they put a bit too much hot sauce on it. The fries and mac and cheese were good with the hot sauce.   An odd mix resulting in a 3 star experience"}
{"text":"Though I would love love loooove to give HSW a five star rating, if only for its legendary status, I can and will not. This particular location is filthy and if I had known that before calling to place an order I would have thought twice. I had to peel my shoes from the floor with each step I took towards the service counter and it grossed me out to no end.  All in all, I will not be returning unless some changes are made. The three stars I give HSW are for the massive portion of crunchy fried okra (I'm a country girl at heart), and the friendly yet professional demeanor of the ladies behind the service counter. The service I received at HSW is its saving grace."}
{"text":"Stopped by hotsauce williams for some takeout today after my hubby's cleveland clinic appt. Read all the hype & was so excited to try it. The drive thru speaker doesn't work & you can vaguely read the menu. They were out of cod. So I ordered a tilapia sandwich(5.50), combo 2chicken & 2ribs w/ coleslaw & macaroni & cheese (12). My hubby got the polish boy(5.25). Well overall we were DISAPPOINTED! The polish boy was SUPER SALTY & the frozen crinkle fries they slapped on top were a soggy mess! My tilapia sandwich was a paper thin breaded piece of fish w/ 2 mashed pieces of white bread on side. So, I put the fish on a bun w/ tartar & a piece of lettuce. It was good. DON'T ORDER THE MAC & CHEESE! It's almost inedible (reference picture). Slaw was warm & kind of soupy, but had flavor. THE RIBS ARE THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY ARE WORTH IT. Pretty meaty, slight char, pretty tender (meat wasn't falling off bone though), & the sauce was a nice balance of sweet & spicy. The fried chicken was decent. Essentially I paid $22 for 2 ribs because that's the only thing I was truly satisfied with. I won't be giving them a 2nd chance sadly..."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but it just had too much going against it. I'm not sure if it's a chain but we tried another place with the same name but that was either closed for the day or forever, we couldn't tell. We found this one a little bit of a drive away and figured we'd try it out. It's supposed to have \"the best ribs in the state\", but I'll never know as after ordering them, we were told they were out of ribs. We had the pork shoulder which was OK but I was looking forward to ribs. We're not from the area so decided to eat in, lucky for us we were one of the first there for dinner as they only have 1 table. Drinks were \"you can buy them from the machine there or cross the street to the convenience store and pick something up\". There are too many other better BBQ places around to bother going back, maybe it's good if you live nearby and can do takeout?"}
{"text":"My first stop when I got to Cleveland was at Hot Sauce Williams, restaurant on Cleveland's East Side, which features a variation on a polish boy that includes the addition of smoked and barbecued pork shoulder to the sandwich, was featured in June 2010 on the Travel Channel's Man vs. Food. Host and food enthusiast Adam Richman tried their Polish boy, which featured the restaurant's signature hot-sauce.   The place is a bit divey.  The neighborhood questionable.  There was a homeless man out front asking every one for money.  I didn't feel unsafe, however, and the ladies were really helpful. Being from the Midwest, I didn't understand all the menu options and they were quick to explain.  When I looked around the bright pink, run down restaurant, I saw quite a mix.  A couple young girls on lunch break, a small black family and a cluster of little old white ladies in another corner.    I came strictly for the polish boy.  A big time foodie I ALWAYS have to try the local delicacies.  The Polish Boy is a sausage sandwich native to Cleveland. It consists of a link of kielbasa placed in a bun, and covered with a layer of french fries, a layer of barbecue sauce or hot sauce, and a layer of coleslaw. While the sausage is typically grilled, some establishments will quickly deep fry the sausage after grilling and prior to assembling the sandwich.  The sauce, ladies and gentlemen, oh that sauce! It was delicious!!  After eating I headed out back and talked to Willie, who has been manning the ribs for 38 years.  Give him a few bucks if you have them!"}
{"text":"Coming here, I had high expectations for this place.  Then I decided to drive by, and I realized that there was a chance I could get shot, despite only being 1/4 mile from the safe haven of the Cleveland Clinic.  Part of this place's success is its proximity to the Cleveland Clinic.  They have a section of the front wall dedicated to when Robin Williams visited after getting heart surgery in 2009.  Next to his frames on the wall are those of Adam Richman, whose visit made this place a nationally-known restaurant.  The floor of this place is filthy.  There are some places where you could probably eat off of the floor; however, you could probably catch a really bad disease doing so here.  The tables weren't much better, either.  Now, to talk about why this place is famous:  their food.  They're best known for their fried chicken and their Polish Boys.  I opted for the Polish Boy, and asked them to put their hot sauce on it.  The Polish Boy is essential a hot dog covered with cole slaw and fries, as well as cayenne pepper seasoning.  The slaw and dog went well together, and were actually complemented by the cayenne pepper seasoning.  However, I thought the fries were a little too soggy for my liking and the hot sauce actually took away from the overall taste of the sandwich by dominating it.  If you opt to not add any hot sauce, this should be one of the best Polish Boys you can find anywhere.  Stefanie C. mentioned that their fried chicken is A-MAZ-ING, but I was unable to try it.  If you are in the area on either Euclid, Carnegie, or Chester, you definitely need to stop by."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I ever had. Went with 12 people and we ordered almost everything on the menu. None of us were disappointed. Well worth the stop. Collared greens were awsome ! Sauce was delicious"}
{"text":"First time going there. A little slow but worth the wait. We got a Polish boy and girl (intrigued by the addition of pulled pork on the girl). Truth be told, we didn't want to eat in so we got it to go since it was not super clean but most because there is no air conditioning on.  The guy in front of us ordered a slab of ribs which is ALOT of meat but said he was working down the road and had never been there. In fact, most of the conversations I heard was that of ppl eating there for the first time. The sauce is the real deal and will definitely go back to try the fried chicken. BTW, the cost of our boy and girl was less than $12.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Seti's truck wasn't around so we decided to head to a restaurant with polish boys that didn't have wheels. I'm really glad we did that - the combo of the polish...girl...was delicious!  It had the added pulled pork on it, the combo of flavors, perfect.    What the fam really loved was that sauce.  I'll probably never be in Cleveland again, but I'll dream of that sauce.  We got the fried chicken, stuck the sauce on the side...but I can see why people just have it drenching that chicken.  Glad we did get it on the side, though, since it was glorious to dip everything into it.  Almost ordered another fries just as a vehicle for the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Man the hating on this place is unreal. Is the parking lot a minefield? Yes. Service slow? Yes. But hush your mouths about the food. This is some of the best stuff in the city. Ribs cooked near perfectly, meaning there is resistance to a bite. Great sauce. Coleslaw was crisp and sauced well. White bread is well, I mean bow good can it be really? Fries could certainly be improved upon. Half slab dinner for $13? C'mon, that's a steal."}
{"text":"Came in for a polish boy and girl, wings, and fries. Took almost 30 mins for the order to be ready. I wasn't impressed with my meal. There was no pork shoulder meat on the polish girl. The wings were ok but the sauce was off. Didn't taste the same. While waiting for my food there were a lot of flies inside which made me weary. There were even a lot of dead flies on the ground. I'm a fan of whole in the wall spots to eat but this was a disappointment. At least the area to wait for food can look and be more clean."}
{"text":"Maybe Mondays are just bad days. Went for the fried chicken. I had a breast - dried out boneless breast ; a thigh - super crunchy but greasy beyond belief and so over cooked that thigh meat had receded it its hardened shell; and a wing, also overcooked and greasy. The coleslaw was ok, but not enough to save the day. The candied yams tasted liked canned yams in the liquid they come in. Maybe they ran out of the butter you need to make candied yams. At least the coke was cold. Oh, I almost forgot the sorry excuse for a corn bread muffin that it came with -dry, mealy and tasteless. By far the worst thing I have ever eaten in Cleveland. I hope the fried chicken is better in Memphis."}
{"text":"While in town we wanted to see what this place was all about after seeing that Man vs Food was here. We came late afternoon and it was pretty quite. You order from a large board and then watch as they load your plate. We had to wait a few for the fries.  Prices were higher than expected. Chicken plate was good, but greasy.  Bbq sauce was yummy!!! Very simple restaurant but historic given the pics on the wall!!!"}
{"text":"The taste of the BBQ is great (and I just recently visited Memphis), tangy but not spicy. But, the pulled pork sandwich (which was recommended by several people) was served on a standard piece of sandwich bread. It did nothing to help the BBQ and it got soggy before I even walked back to my table. The flavor was awesome and served with coleslaw right on the sandwich. Plenty of food with the fries. I left stuffed!  The dining room could use a little love, but it has a divey charm to it. I will be back for sure, but I will try something other than the sandwich. Thanks for having me!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! All the is good. I seen it on one of the food shows so I had to try it. I definitely will go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland tradition! I will always stop here for the fries with sauce!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best BBQ in all of Ohio, maybe even the best in the country (yes I know I need to eat it down in Memphis, Texas, and the Carolinas first to claim that.)  They have a thin sauce, which I like far more than the thick sauces, which is the most flavorful and succulent BBQ sauce I've ever had.  I have the Polish Boy which hit the spot.  They need to open a location downtown so it's easier to access and sees more traffic.  They would make far more money in a location like this too."}
{"text":"This is rated way to low, a true Cleveland Classic.  The fried chicken was amazing, when you have a cheat day or you want to indulge without remorse grab a few pieces here. Really good and not greasy.  The sides I always get are the Mac n cheese, rich and cheesy. Then my other fav are the greens, they have a lot of flavor.   I had several desert items here and you can't go wrong they are all good eats.  Overall great soul food restaurant that will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"3 stars seems about right.. Interesting pink decor. The chicken was very good, hot and flaky.  Ribs were a disappointment. Almost 19 bucks for rib, chicken combo. Expensive."}
{"text":"Never tasted a worse barbecue sauce anywhere.  I got the signature ribs and sauce, with fries, & slaw.  The sauce had a tang to it that I should have recognized as spoiled, and the ribs were dry.  And to make matters worse, all of my fries were covered in the sauce?  Our waitress was very nice and helped guide us through the menu.  However, the food and cleanliness was substandard for a supposed Cleveland Icon, or any eatery for that matter. Lots of fruit flies and the itsy-bitsy spider enjoyed watching us eat from our window sill."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The wings and fries were not that fresh and very little chicken came on the bone. The sauce was ok. I like Open Pit Bar B Que's (Cleveland, OH) sauce better because it's sweeter. I tried this because it was on the travel channel. It really wasn't that good. I like Harold's Chicken Shack in Atlanta and Chicago way better when it comes to chicken and sauce."}
{"text":"They do not keep the hours they advertise, service is rude, food is cold, such as  shame."}
{"text":"Asked for a polish boy with extra Cole slaw and extra fries and was denied and told \"We don't do that here\"... I will never go back..."}
{"text":"I love their fried chicken with their house made hot sauce on it. It is the epitome of southern fried chicken. The coleslaw is great and creamy. Fries are your standard crinkle cut fries but great to dip in their sauce.  I am also a fan of the polish girl and polish boy (Cleveland staple). I like the sauce but their ribs are a little fatty and not meaty, therefore I personally don't order the ribs. So that is the food. Now the atmosphere is not that great but you can't expect a fancy atmosphere and as long as you know what to expect in the neighborhood then you are fine. Now the service is another story. Expect an attitude, rude servers and someone who is just downright annoyed that you are bothering them by making them have to work by preparing your order.   They also run out of food and no matter what time it is they won't be making any more because once again it's too much work. I therefore have to call to make sure they have certain types of  food like chicken breasts before I come as I live 30 minutes away and can't tell you how many times I made the drive and was told they are out of white meat and don't plan to make anymore. They also close early if they don't feel like being open anymore. I actually had them turn the lights and drive through system off on me when I drive up an hour or two before their official closing time. So to sum up, the food is great, service is horrible so if you go in expecting someone to not like you to get some great BBQ then you will be happy."}
{"text":"Not impressed ... I got the 3 piece chicken dinner with green beans and coleslaw. The coleslaw was cool? Green beans were bland, the chicken was cooked perfect very juicy and crispy but that's where it ends... I got the sauce because if the reviews... I'm still waiting to see what the fuss was about... Maybe it was the location, maybe the other locations are better. I will not be a return customer. I wish I would have gotten the po boy. Oh well I'll never know what it taste like because I just don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"In town for Indians game and decided to try Hot Sauce Williams BBQ on Carnegie.. We ordered Polish Girl Deluxe, Polish Boy and 1/2 slab of Ribs... Ribs were covered in a delicious sauce... The ribs were huge but not very meaty... Grisly and majority of the bones had more gristle than meat... Fries were below average.. Typical crinkle frozen fry... The sauce is good but if you get the sauce with the fries and/or your polish girl or polish boy.. They totally drench your sandwich and fries so they become  a soggy mush. The sandwich was ok, however don't expect to pick it up.. So much sauce on it bread falls apart ..I don't mind a messy sandwich but this sandwich was water logged with sauce... No knives just plastic forks makes eating open face sandwich difficult...While I was there I asked for a cup of water was told they don't have any... The interior of the place is below average, tables were dirty restrooms were dirty(woman's restroom closed)!! The service was slow, people not very friendly... Overall disappointing experience for a so called \"Cleveland Original\". Maybe their Fried Chicken is better. I'll never know because I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep my review short and sweet!   Polish Boy and the wings, OFF THE CHAIN!  Nuff siad!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight for the first time and it will NOT be our last! The fried chicken is best I've ever had  and my ppl are from South Carolina! His sauce is very very good! And the owner was very hospitable and spoke to us about the  history of this famous restaurant. They will be taping on Rachel Ray's show next week! Kudos y'all!"}
{"text":"Although the outside is a little scary the food is to die for. I ordered the family meal and it was absolutely amazing!!!!! The fried chicken with the sauce poured on top was enough to satisfy even the bigger BBQ fanatic the ribs were amazing and the Mac n cheese is baked and very good as well. One of those places you'll become a regular."}
{"text":"We've driven past Hot Sauce Williams any number of times, always on our way to some other event, always promising that we'd stop \"next time.\"  Well \"next time\" finally arrived. And we are kicking ourselves for taking so long. The fried chicken was the best I've ever eaten - juicy and tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. The ribs were tasty, as was the sauce. The macaroni and cheese is only beaten by the memory of mac-and-cheese from a sadly defunct soul food restaurant (it was so good we called it \"crack-aroni and cheese\"). The yams and baked beans were also excellent.  The restaurant is counter service, with a spacious, beaten-up dining room. Considering that the dining rooms in the soul food restaurants where we ate in Atlanta consisted of picnic tables and benches, the decor seems fitting. The service was perfunctory, but not rude.   In sum, delicious food that's SO bad for you - definitely not daily fare, but the choice for soul food here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you're from Cleveland and you have never been here, you are really missing out. This place is legendary. It's small and shabby looking. But the food does not disappoint. I almost always make a pit stop when I visit home. I always ask them to drench my fries in their sauce. Their ribs are to die for as well. The area is kinda sketchy though. I prefer to go when it's daytime"}
{"text":"We went in just around 4:00 pm and there was no nor was there to be any pork shoulder. I asked.  They might have it tomorrow.   It is the top sandwich on the menu.   I ordered a polish boy, the bun was STALE, sausage luke warm and fries were soggy.  My friend had a two piece chicken dinner.  He liked it  This place is just worn out and poorly run.  As we were leaving there were many people in line.  I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Gross! I could make ribs better at home. The ribs are super dry yet covered in a layer of fat. The sauce is good, just enough spice with a little kick. The fried chicken is awful. The breading is so saturated in grease that the breading nor the chicken have any flavor but grease. The cole slaw taste like bargain tub at any off price grocery store.    The fries are under cooked/ possibly microwaved. So over rated. Cash only."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped here on our way home from vacation. I wanted a polish boy, but Seti's is closed on weekends. This place had a good rep for theirs. I had the polish girl (polish boy with pork shoulder). It was tasty, but didn't think its size justified its price. Paid over $9 for something noticeably smaller than a regular hot dog. Yeah, it had fries and a can of soda, but still.....The sauce was good, but don't expect it to be hot. We waited a long time in an empty restaurant for anyone to come up to the counter to take our order. She saw us, but kept wandering around not really doing anything. Seemed like they were out of everything. No chicken sandwich, no corn fritters, no fried chicken breasts, and a few other things the people behind us ordered. The woman taking our order acted like we were bothering her and that she was doing us a huge favor by doing her job. There was a cheap boom box blaring awful music you coudn't get away from no matter where you sat. I don't care one way or the other about decor, but if you do, don't go here. Table cloths look like cheap shower curtains a 4yr old picked out, and there is a cheap entertainment center in the dinning room. Who puts an entertainment center in the middle of a restaurant, lol? All in all, the food tasted good, but wasn't the best value, the service was crap, and the decor was laughable."}
{"text":"Can't even review because no one will.ANSWER the phone during THEIR listed business hours! Called multiple times; very gross and highly unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Chicken and sides were fantastic.  I like my BBQ better but neat place with good chicken."}
{"text":"Sweet merciful Fried Chicken and Polish Boys!  It is absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"I'll review this place regardless if I just that is been permanently closed. At least their other location will still be open. Being from out of town of course we decided to dine in. They had a huge dining room but very outdated. They had an area where you could tell was where all their condiments were supposed to be as well as plastic silverware but was all empty. We were the only ones dining in, but they did have a lot of take out. It was non stop. I really don't blame them, I wouldn't want to eat in that uninviting dining room either. But it's not that big of an issue to have to knock down their rating. It's all about the food baby!    I ordered their Polish Boy combo. Basically their polish boy, fries and a can of pop. They ask you if you want sauce on your fries but they don't tell you..\"for an additional charge?\" It's ok though. Probably would of paid it. Polish boy itself was very good. This is one hot dog that I'm not able to eat without silverware. The polish sausage was delicious topped with Cole slaw, fries and their special bbq sauce. We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese. It looked and tasted weird. Nothing much else to say about their Mac and cheese.   Like I said before, it's unfortunate that this location closed down. They served delicious food and was conveniently located  just outside downtown. I'll have to start going to their other location."}
{"text":"Decor and service leave much to be desired, but the food is worthy of 4.5 stars. I've eaten at both locations several times now over the past year, since moving from San Diego, and I think the food is very good.  The fried chicken and Polish Boy in particular are awesome.  The ribs are just average. good sauce, but not super tender and have not been smoked enough for my taste."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken and ribs but the polish boy is the best.  Service seems fine to me.  No inside seating."}
{"text":"My good friend, a native Clevelander, described this spot as a Cleveland staple. In town for a Cavs game & we gave it a try!   My BF & friend had the pork shoulder & it looked great. They loved it, I tried it & wished I ordered it. It's on white bread & looks a little mysterious but it's delish. I ordered the chicken ...I waited....& waited for this stupid chicken. My friends & BF were done eating by the time I got my chicken *sigh* not cool. Luckily I got my sides first which were mac n cheese (dry and tasteless) and greens (ok). I was so excited for this place & what a bummer. The chicken was juicy but had no flavor. I am a white girl that grew up in Pittsburgh, I'm not asking for much in terms of flavor but my God this was tasteless.   Let's touch on the location, def off the beaten path. I felt as if I were at a fire hall. The decor reminded me of a low budget bridal shower. It's positively outdated which is fine, it's a dive. I wish the food made up for the detoured drive, long wait & weird set up."}
{"text":"My favorite spots are dumps. This joint is no exception. Food's great. Staff are cool. Value is there. I would like to know the origin of the fried chicken batter recipe because it bears an amazing resemblance to B&M BBQ's sweet tempura like quality. Cabbage was a bit chemical fire tasting. Granted I came in later in the day. I have to think this place rules at say 11:15 AM and 6:22 PM. I need to call ahead to see what time the pans hit the steam table. You know what I'm sayin'?"}
{"text":"I have been going here for at long time and its one of few places I can overlook bad service because I love the food. The wings are great, best wings in Cleveland but the best offering from here is the barbeque sauce. Better service and it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I haven't seen this much pink and aqua since the days of Miami Vice! The decor of Hot Sauce Williams doesn't look like it's been updated since the 80's-esque crime drama either.   Yeah, I get it. Bourdain went here. An episode of Man vs. Food was shot here. East 79th & Carnegie has never seen so many white foodsters flocking here because their favorite TV-foodie says it was good. It's an institution to some. Criticizing it would be akin to criticizing your Mom. Despite all of that, I will still go on record as to saying that Cleveland STILL doesn't do good BBQ. At least no public place that I've found yet does.   Hot Sauce Williams is kind of overwhelming. A lot of locals seem to come here. They know what they want even before they arrive. As you enter, a line forms, similar to that of a fast food counter. Place your order, pay, wait for the already prepared food in chaffing dishes to be sauced and packaged and eat it either in the dining room or take it to-go. But wait; there's no menu on the wall! Luckily I found a stack of paper in the dining room that resembled a menu. In no specific order or fashion, the piece of paper spouts off an assortment of food offerings and prices. A different piece of paper that's plastered to the wall says something about substituting sides will cost an additional 85-cents.   The typical dinner will include fried chicken/ribs/pork.etc, a side of slaw, fries and bread. I ordered the chicken dinner. The slaw looked way too liquidy for my tastes, so I upgraded to the mac & cheese. The chicken, smothered in hot sauce was bland, un-crispy and tasted like it was sitting around for a while. The fries were packaged frozen cottage fries (not fresh cut) with their signature sauce dumped on top. The mac and cheese was overcooked and so tender, it almost melts in your mouth. I'm not sure pasta should dissolve like that. They were unfortunately out of cornbread when we went, so we got slices of Wonder bread to go along with our meal. The whole dinner, packaged in a Styrofoam to-go box had to be rubber-banded together because it was overflowing with food.   The meal was good in a sloppy, messy, down-and-dirty kind of way I guess. That's the way most BBQ is meant to be eaten I suppose. I was just completely underwhelmed by the whole thing. I do BBQ at home in the summer. I have a wood burning smoker where I smoke meats of all varieties. I make cornbread in my cast iron skillet. I love greens and mac and cheese. Needless to say, I've had much better at home and with not much effort. I know the potential for this type of cuisine and I'm not giving this place any sort of break because it's a so called \"Cleveland institution\". Cleveland deserves better BBQ."}
{"text":"Forget about the place and service (which were fine) and let's talk about the food!  The Polish Boy was good, but the fried chicken was AMAZING!!  And the sauce was killer!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump trust me I know dumps and this is one when one car is in the parking lot smells like trouble went in a chicken was staring  me in the face saying  take me I been here for a minute..I left cause I value my life and stomach..Eater bware"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I ate here because it has been that long. Well it will be my last... The menu on Yelp quotes one price so a slab dinner 19.95 when I pick up my food it's $29. The girl at the register rude even when you call in to order  tone very dry... Food over I should have saved myself the trouble and gas and just pulled out my own grill!"}
{"text":"This place is really bad. The food is sitting precooked on a very dirty counter under a heat lamp. Everything is soggy and messy. The whole place is filthy and the employees have a terrible attitude. Yuck."}
{"text":"Sauce spicy and blan absolutely no flavor the decor screams dont eat here plus the entire staff is moody not to mention chicken wings are 1.50 a piece a true rip off!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars for the fried chicken alone. It is amazing. It has this super crunchy crust that is totally unlike anything I've ever had on fried chicken before. It's like having your chicken thoroughly egg-battered and then friend crispy. The result is positively delicious.   I love the ribs too. They don't boil their ribs before cooking them, so if you like 'fall off the bone' type ribs, these are not for you. These are good ribs to knaw on. They were also impressively big.  I almost docked them a star for borderline surly service and lack of A/C, but at this price ($30 for four people +leftovers) I can hardly complain. They'll have to be much grouchier than that to keep me away from that fried chicken.  Things that were great: +Mac n cheese +Fried chicken +Sausage  +BBQ sauce  Things that were not great: -Not terribly friendly (to us) -No diet in the soda machine -Greens were only so so -The sausage ends up too soaked in slaw and bbq sauce to actually eat with your hands. The bun will just fall apart. -Zero ambiance. They could use the services of a carpenter and a painter.  Final note: this review is for the pink location on Carnegie and does not apply to the Lee Rd location, which was only mediocre IMHO."}
{"text":"hot sauce williams is amazing, but it is certainly not a place to go for a low calorie meal. fried chicken, st. louis style ribs, mac n cheese, sweet potato pie, etc. it's all awesome. the fried chicken is done perfectly! my mouth waters just thinking of this place. its a simple place, you order from a counter and can either take your food to go or eat it there. all that matters is the food is killer!"}
{"text":"Mrs. Doubtfire was here!  No really Robin Williams dined at this location.    The Fried chicken is crunch in your mouth drippy kind of good!   My favorite meal is the polish girl.  it just screams \"Eat Me!!\"    polish dog piled high with pulled pork, crinkled fries drenched in slaw and oh so good tangy HSW sauce.   Oh how the sauce enhances the taste, Makes you want seconds  Now when you eat your hot Polish Girl, you have to be gentle it tends to get sloppy.  I ease on into it.  I always end up with a mess on my hands and face.  wipe down needed after this Feast.  Sometimes I settle for the polish boy, a little less mess and take it all in kind of treat   \"Ease on into it\""}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The food came very fast. Almost seemed like fast food. I ordered the polish boy. I haven't had one since I was a kid. Brings back a lot of memories."}
{"text":"I found the ribs here underwhelming, they tasted a little overcooked and tough.  However, fried chicken is really good here. Not overly breaded, perfectly fried, and the chicken itself is warm and tender. Get the sauce on the side, since I'd imagine you are getting takeout and the last thing you want is the chicken to turn into a sloppy mess by the time you get home.   Wait times have been surprisingly long (on the order of 20 - 30 minutes) despite how there is almost no line. If you come here hungry and stare at the food while waiting, this will be torture. At least they give you so much food that it still amazes me to this day how they actually manage to fit it in the takeout box.  Eating here regularly is ill-advised, if nothing else because I would prefer to not require the services of the world famous (and strategically close) Cleveland Clinic cardiologists and cardiac surgeons."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BARBECUE IVE EATEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! We came up to OH for a wedding and ventured out to get some of the Man v. Food- famed food, and it didn't disappoint. Definitely worth making the trip up from Maryland."}
{"text":"This is a spot for after a night of clubbing. It will be packed with people ordering wings and polish boys. A polish boy is a polish sausage topped with french fries and cole slaw and bar-b-que sauce. Wings are served with sauce too. You can also get fish and ribs. It is pretty cheap. The women who take the orders are smart alecs who can handle the varied crowd that they service nightly. Everything is carry out so call your order in if you can."}
{"text":"My friend and I were talking about this place and we decided to get a quick take out order for lunch.  He hadn't been here in years and I haven't been here ever so we headed out.  I was curious because it was on Man vs. Food and if Adam liked why shouldn't I?  Inside the restaurant I saw pictures of celebrities that have visited which included Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Williams and other celebs hanging on the walls.   I tried the po'boy and chicken/rib dinner.  The BBQ sauce was tasty with initial sweet and then hot tones, slightly delayed.  As you get more into the meal the heat starts to build up.  It was good and probably the best part of it all.  The same sauce was used on basically everything that is served there.    The po'boy was a mess so I used knife and fork to eat this.  The sausage reminded me of polish kielbasi which had snap and nice flavor.  You either like it or not and for me there was a lot going on.  You have french fries, BBQ sauce and coleslaw happening at once. Have a flexible pallet if haven't had this before.  I thought this was good.  The ribs were okay, maybe on the tough side  Did we get leftovers from the day before?  As we were leaving, we didn't see the smoker in use at the back part of the parking lot. The chicken was tasty and was slathered with the same sauce."}
{"text":"When I moved here from KC I was excited to find some great local BBQ so I starting asking everyone I met where their favorite was ... This place was mentioned by multiples so I thought it would be the first I tried.... Sooooo disappointing ... Looks like a dump outside but that's never stopped good BBQ before ....Food is sitting in hot plates/warmers under a cafeteria style covering sitting there for who knows how long ... As unappetizing as this was I went for it and wished I hadn't ... Served in to-go containers absolutely drenched in sauce (mind you I like sauce as a KCer) but it was soggy, and not in the fall of the bone type of way .... Wtf were there so many photos of famous peeps on the walls for??? I would never go back here.  I get CLE isn't known for BBQ but how is this known as their best? I feel sorry for everyone that has no idea what they are missing out on .... Let it b known I've had amazing BBQ in Texas, Oklahoma, Memphis, Chicago ... I'm bias to KC but crap is crap and this was crap."}
{"text":"I am from the south originally and this would get no love in the bbq mecca of the world.  I am not sure what people do with ribs in this town, but I have to imagine it is using high heat and flames until the meat has no other options than to crumble.    I love the charm of the place and they are making it their own, but overall the food was okay with a lot of the flavor coming from over seasoning.  I would eat here again, but it is not a place that I will seek.  To each their own...it's just not my style of que and I wanted to like this place as I am still seeking a \"real\" bbq restaurant in this town."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken and sides.  I had tried some of their ribs at the Taste of Cleveland last year though, and wasn't too impressed since the meat was a little tough and the sauce, just OK."}
{"text":"Superb chicken with service that is a little on the slow side.  Hot Sauce Williams has very good fried chicken.  The pieces are huge and very crispy.  You can have the restaurant's famous barbecue sauce on the side or served on the chicken - personally I like the chicken better without the sauce on it.  The ribs are decent, but in my opinion the chicken is the winner here.  The only reason I didn't give this place 4 stars was that it took quite a while (more than 30 minutes) for me to get my chicken both of the times I came here.  While I appreciated how fresh the chicken was, I thought that the new batches of food could have come out more quickly.  Also, the serving could have been more efficient.  When I have time to wait though and want to buy a large tray of fried chicken for a party, this will be the place that I will be going to."}
{"text":"The hot sauce tastes great! I picked up an order of a wings dinner with sauce, plus a polish boy, for less than $15. The wings dinner came with 4 jumbo chicken wings, 2 slices of bread, coleslaw, and fries. I had to try the polish boy, which was impossible without a fork, and I gotta admit it was good.  I called ahead and was told my order would be ready in 10 minutes. The girl on the phone was very friendly. I showed up 20 minutes later, but my order hadn't been put together at all. They put my food in to-go containers and bagged it up after I got there, so it doesn't seem to make a different if you call ahead.  I thought the price was great for the amount of food (it was enough for 2 people). And the sauce is too tasty. I would definitely get the wings dinner again!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is slow.  This means do not go there for a quick to go food.  I ordered a side of \"mac and cheese\" and fries.  The \"mac and cheese\" was already prepared but it took them 20 minutes to get my fries.  There was no sense of urgency amongst the entire staff, they just assumed everybody came to spend their entire day in the restaurant waiting for food."}
{"text":"This is a funny place.  Being from Youngstown, and not Cleveland, I went here after my Cleveland Clinic appointment, because I saw this place on Man vs Food.  I went there for one reason only...the Polish Boy.  The service staff was really under-enthused to wait on me...even though I was only 1 of 4 people in the whole joint.  The 1st lady who I said hi to pointed me in the direction of the stack of paper menus, without saying anything back to me.    The Polish Boy, was not on it.  But after asking the lady at the counter, they DO still have it available.  It's a kielbasa on a bun, topped with fries, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce.  The TV show also added pork shoulder to the sandwich, but for some reason, they didn't put it on mine.  It was awesome nonetheless.    The place was a dive, doesn't look that clean, and it's located in a not-so-great side of town, and the service was lacking any personality.  However, the Polish Boy was GREAT.  I would definitely have this again.  I hear their other food is good too, but the PB is all I wanted.  3 stars for the food.  0 stars for the service.  Letter Grade:  B"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! Just had to throw that in right off the bat.  Since every single other review has been for the original location, I thought I'd give the East side some love. While I didn't have the sass the other people have had with the staff I chalk that up to being Southern, as there's something about a Southern boy saying \"please\" and \"ma'am\" that tends to quell the uppity types.  So being said that I'm a Southerner, life is rough in Cleveland when it comes to getting solid southern style BBQ. Now make no mistake, HSW is no Memphis rib joint but in a pinch and devoid as I am of options up here it made a pretty decent substitute. Sure they've got all the southern staples - ribs, chicken, catfish, pork - but there was just something missing.  My buddy and I each opted for the Pork Shoulder sandwich - a large scoop of shredded pork with their traditional HSW sauce, a scoop of cole slaw, and all encased between 2 pieces of white bread. That last bit was a nice touch - everybody Southern knows the value of white bread in BBQ. What made me happiest was seeing 2 things on the menu I wasn't expecting: fried okra and peach cobbler. Both were pretty tasty, but one order of the okra is enough for a few people to share as they give you a ton of the little guys.  They don't take cards, cash only, and expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your food to pop up once you've ordered. There are no fountain drinks - only a couple of Coke machines so if you're dining in make sure you've got some extra cash for those.   I've had considerably better BBQ, but not in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland and just had to try a Polish boy- but it was Saturday so Seti's wasn't open. Decided Hot Sauce Williams would be a decent alternative given the circumstances. All I ordered was one Polish boy for $5.25 from a not too friendly set of workers and was given my order in 2-3 minutes.   The first thing I noticed was that this could not be eaten by hand. I picked up the dog and the bun immediately fell apart from being drenched in sauce. I managed to get a bite of all the flavors and they mixed fairly well but nothing special. The hot dog had good beef flavor but tasted like it had been sitting around for awhile. The fries were regular crinkle fries like you get in an Ore-Ida bag and the coleslaw had a strong mayonnaise taste, but I really liked the hot barbecue sauce put on the dog. Overall despite not being assembled of the greatest ingredients I think the polish boy was better than the sum of its parts and actually tasted pretty good when you were able to get a bite of all the elements."}
{"text":"Manager, please delete this review after owner of Yelp has read . . . Thank you.  Well, let me tell you.  I love he food here!  However, I had a costly-to-owner and manager, and a terrible experience today (well, the 12th a Wednesday), and they need to know if they want to keep customers!!!  Who knows how many people just walk out because of the rude and slow staff - I'm sure they do it all the time and just don't tell the boss.  Here is what I am trying to communicate, and I can find no other way.  Website non-existent.   My would-be communique: You lost 3 customers in a row today, August 12, at about 4:30, including the 2 ahead of me and then me.  I would have spent around $20.  The two were mother and son, and who knows what a growing boy eats?!   The 2 in front of me (no one else in line or the restaurant) waited and waited even to be acknowledged let alone waited on.  There were 3 employees - a man and 2 women -who saw clearly we were there.  The customers and I chatted pleasantly for a good 5 minutes.  They got tired of waiting - for anything.  They left.  I was now the only customer.  One would think that their seeing 2 walkouts would have prompted them to action!   The 3 of them stood directly in front of me at the register!  They did everything to pretend I wasn't there.  Could they not have said \"we'll be right with you\"?  Totally ignored me and instead counted tickets and chit-chatted about.  There was plenty of food, so they were in no crunch.  I'd have spent $20 - LOSS.  Mother and son, who knows? - LOSS.  I go to your place because it's usually great and I am a frequent Clinic visitor. Frankly, I would fire all three of these employees if I were you.  You've got a great business, but who knows how many customers walk out.  RUDE EMPLOYEES might be chasing away more than you know.   Susan Bednar"}
{"text":"The drive thru speaker is broke and you have to order at the window, so you will not have the benefit of a menu.  The polish boy, ribs, fries and sauce were really good.  The only disappointment was I got there late at night and no more chicken wings ...but we will go back"}
{"text":"Delicious Fried Chicken! Though the name is Hot Sauce Williams Barbecue Restaurant, this is the place to get fried chicken not ribs. Their ribs are so so to me. The fried chicken, however, is heavenly. Their sauce is wonderful too but I always get it in a cup and put on the chicken sparingly cause the chicken is top notch without it. The crust is perfect. After eating chicken here Popeyes, Churches and the rest of those national franchises' chicken taste awful to me. Love their excellent down home side dishes too. Four stars and not five because of the ho hum customer service (sometimes) and poorly put together menu. A side note, no matter what time I come into this place the clientele is always around 60 percent Black and 40 Percent White, with more Whites eating in the restaurant and a higher percentage of Blacks taking out."}
{"text":"The huge downfall that this place has is that it is not organized at all. You place your order and they ring you up, then you find out that they ran out of what you ordered (on this particular day, they ran out of hot sauce and chicken wings). You then have the cashier shouting the orders. You are done right, just wait for your food to be called? No. You constantly repeat what you ordered to the person actually making your food and then they ask the cashier again to make sure. I don't know my order? Am I trying to get more food then what I paid for? Why didn't you ask the cashier in the first place?  I don't know why this place gets so much hype. Maybe its because the midwesterners don't experience great barbecue but this is average compared to the barbecue in Memphis. Not worth the drive unless you are dying for barbecue. Just writing this makes me want to drive 12 hours to Memphis to get some pork shoulder, ribs, and slaw."}
{"text":"I've had food from this restaurant numerous times throughout my life in Cleveland. Hell, it's one of our notable eateries. We used to get this food days prior to Christmas so we can feast that day. This will mark the 3rd year that we haven't done it. And here's why:  I understand that over time, things change but Hot Sauce Williams changed for the worst. The meat has gotten to the point where it's either underdone or overcooked. The sauce is absolutely putrid. It was good until they decided to bottle their sauce and gotten too lazy to actually make it, they just use the bottled stuff. Every bottled sauce is largely watered down and makes food taste horrible. You're best off making a decent sauce from scratch, experimenting and let flavors soak in.  The service has gotten worse and so has to people there. Why hasn't the health department stepped in, I don't know but I literally feel the need to bathe by just looking at the building. The people are very rude, spewing out offensive and unacceptable language at a restaurant and give you an attitude when you try to correct their mistakes.  All I can say is there goes the neighborhood in terms of barbecue. Very disappointed to what they have become and the quality of their food. Just save your money, buy your own meat and barbecue yourself. You'll be saving more money and gain more food and more satisfaction to your own culinary talents."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED??  A year ago I would recommend anyone visiting Cleveland to come here.  NOT AFTER TODAY!!  I used to LOVE going here!  The Polish boy was one my personal favorites.  Today, I was on my way home and just happened to come by Hot Sauce Williams so I pulled in.  I knew I would have to wait at the drive thru but ...WOW!  15 minutes??  I should have just parked my car and went in.  Drive Thru is a BAD IDEA at this establishment.  I pulled up to the speaker and a piece of cardboard was over the speaker and written in marker saying \"STOP! Order here!\" I ordered and I will come to find out that the prices on their outside menu are WRONG and MORE EXPENSIVE than listed! (I didn't know this but I will explain later). On top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. I ordered the Polish Boy combo and small size fried okra.  I had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before I arrived at the window ( I made a mental note changing radio stations because when I arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' as I kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80's channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one).  Do not think of this place as a typical 'fast food' drive thru.  You order and you will WAIT but they don't tell you that which can be a good thing.  This can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn't seem like it was 'fresh' in least bit.  In fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside BEFORE the drive thru customers because I actually watched 3 polish boys being made while I waited for my single polish boy because I guess the people inside took priority and they had only ONE person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages.  While watching someone else's food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!!  I gave her my money and at first I just simply thought the tax was high so I asked why my total was $11.98?  Apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are WRONG!  The RUDE employee didn't tell me anything.  She just \"handed\" me a receipt.  Instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99!  I told the lady this and she just said, \"It is?  I will have to change that.\"  She walked away and I NEVER saw her again. Well, what about you OVERCHARGING??  I was already upset waiting for food so I turned my car off to save gas until I arrived at the window. I was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. Coke in a can. As I was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! WHAT!! This is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? You AVOID them!       Finally I received my food.  They had ANOTHER employee hand me the food and this worker was a male.  I was actually able to talk with him and say that I was overcharged. He was not helpful or even courteous in ANY way! He said, \"I can't help you, I don't work with the menu.\" I kept telling him, this was WRONG, you can't overcharge customers and you can't treat people like this! Again, like a robot, \"I can't help you with that.\"  I heard enough. \"If you can't fix this or help and NONE of you are willing to help without me making a scene then I'm DONE with ALL of you!\" He replied again, \"I can't help you\" and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window.       I'M NEVER RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! What happened?? The employees don't care! A year ago this was a decent place! They even have photos of Robin Williams (I miss him so much!) visiting there with his family.  What happened? I don't know and I WISH I could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the LOWEST rating. I had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will ALWAYS be overlooked by this horrible treatment! THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT AND ATTITUDE! Even the food changed in my opinion. My Polish Boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy.  Worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. It was watered down and tasted old if that's possible. I WILL NOT RETURN."}

This place falls well short of service and decor excellence so you have to be prepared for that when coming here. The location is also not ideal. By that I mean it's not located in the best neighborhood.   Now, with that being said, the food definitely makes up for it. And whether you're a Clevelander or here shortly from out of town, this institution is worth a visit.   We ordered the Polish Girl, 3 piece chicken dinner, Mac and cheese and greens. First, I'll start with the chicken, and quite simply the BEST I've had. You will find yourself breaking off pieces of that super crispy and delicious skin and dipping in their signature sauce (which should replace ketchup everywhere!) If you're like me and tend to stay away from pieces of white meat with the fear it will be too dry, fear not, the white meat pieces are just as tender as the dark pieces which is always a good sign of perfectly fried chicken.   Now the Polish Girl. Wow ok. You will keep your hands clean because this is a fork meal. This is a spectacle of meat-in-tube form. A kielbasa covered with pork shoulder, topped with fries and that sauce! If your that crazy, get the slaw on top of that! The beauty of this tangy sauce they make is that it an pretty much go on everything.   The mac n cheese was so-so, but I'll never eat fried chicken without it. The greens are epic. Even if you don't really like greens or if you've never had them and don't think you'll like them, get them. They're amazing.  That being said, if you want a kick-ass comfort, stick-to-your-ribs meal and want to throw everything you know about dieting out the window and you can look past the horrific pink and blue, dated and a little grimes decor and don't really give a hoot about service as long as they bring you the glory that is being made in the kitchen, this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything here other than the fried chicken but the fried chicken is great. Good price, too. It comes with a \"hot sauce\" that really is more tomato based than spicy. The building/location is kind of tacky/ratchet."}
{"text":"First let me start off by addressing the negative dine-in reviews at this establishment.   I think of Hot Sauce Williams as one of those places where you would never imagine eating your food inside. It's more of a pick-up and go. I mean..really..once taking a look a the decor, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO? Kind of reminds me of several of the Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. Yes, there are places to sit and eat, but why would you?   It's a take-out centric establishment  Now getting that out of the way I can say that hot sauce williams has pretty good wings. Probably not, \"OMG THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD\", but they're good.   Ribs can be hit or miss..and I'm not a polish boy fan, but I can defintely say I've been coming here for the wings for over 10 years.   Just try it out with an open mind..and opt out of dining in if you're easily disgruntled by the surroundings. OH YEAH..and mostly everyone who works there has an attitude problem out of this world. It's not gonna stop so you may as well just remain numb to whatever interaction you have...because more than likely it won't be pleasant."}
{"text":"Disgusting.. don't go here. Food used to be good, but who knows what happened. Last time I went in a bunch of \"kids\" were working. I used to go here all the time. I ordered wings and they were literally inedible. Tastes nothing like the other locations.. this place has changed for the absolute worst. I can't believe it because I grew up going here. I mean it's just chicken.. how the hell could you mess that up so badly????"}
{"text":"If you don't like this place, you're racist.  Just joking.  I had the fried chicken and ribs dinner, which included a breast and a wing of their unbelievably crispy and delicious fried chicken, two large ribs, which were tender and smothered in tangy bbq sauce, and a side of mac and cheese and baked beans (both great).  As many on this site have written, the decor and location aren't the best, but don't let that discourage you.  If you're in the mood for southern style soul food and in Cleveland, check out Hot Sauce Williams post-haste."}
{"text":"Hometown Favorite.... Best Bbq in Cleveland. I only go home once maybe twice a year so when I'm here, I HAVE to indulge. The great thing about this visit was I received 3 free wings with sauce because it's my birthday month. You can download the Spot On app to earn \"spots\" for free meal items from various resturants. So on top of the 3 wings I had coleslaw, fries with sauce and 2 slices of bread. It's really a carry out resturant but I sat and ate there with the one table they did have. Lol If you ever in Cleveland, you have to check them out."}
{"text":"HSW is the best.    Best fried chicken north of the Mason/Dixon. I have enjoyed HSW many times over the years.   Tried the ribs for the first time, delicious.   Great food, will be back again and again and again.  Thank you HSW for offering this fine food in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Yes while featured on several national food TV shows Hot Sauce Williams relies heavily on their reputation more than anything.  Don't get me wrong, the food is tasty just not to the level that one would believe watching the television shows."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars for food. DELICIOUS fried chicken, beans, and pork ribs. And I mean, delicious. Wow. Did not expect that out of a place looking like HSW. Got a smoker in the back, and with the looks of smoke rings on the ribs, you know they're doing it right.ac and cheese was ok, polish boy was good, and so was the fried okra. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I was really interested in this place because of the Man vs Food and other foodie reviews and publicity.  To say that its in an interesting section of town is an understatement.  The location is a bit rundown and the interior might need a good scrubbing.  When I came in at 1245p, there was no fried chicken ready, no greens and it didn't seem that they were ready to serve customers for lunch.  The place was pretty empty though.  I asked if they had any chicken and it was 6 minutes until it was done.  I'd wait.  Ordered the two piece and mac/cheese and cole slaw.  Total for that was about $10.  Food arrived... no frills.  Cole slaw was darned good, wished there was more.  Mac & cheese was nothing special.  Chicken was great.  Not especially tasty flour coating, but the chicken itself was PERFECTLY DONE.  Not 1 degree too little, not 1 degree too much.  Melts in the mouth.  For the food, I'd give it a 3.5 stars.  The decor gets one star.  But food trumps decor..."}
{"text":"Well, it's definitely overrated, based on expectations from various food shows, but that doesn't mean it's bad. I had the Polish boy combo meal- Polish boy, fries, and a drink. The fries were pretty unremarkable. I'm pretty sure they were just OreIda frozen fries. The Polish boy was actually a lot smaller and skimpier than I thought it was going to be. I had fasted a little bit, so I was a little let down. That being said, it was still plenty of food and the sauce really is amazing! Seriously, smothering my sandwich and fries in the sauce made up for anything that was lacking. It's not a fancy place, but I liked that about Hot Sauce Williams. In this age of Cleveland celebrity chefs and pretentiousness, it's refreshing to go to a middle class place in a decidedly non-trendy neighborhood. I'll go back again, just with slightly different expectations."}
{"text":"They changed the sauce. My friends and I used to go here in the 1980's when wings were .25. Clean location. Slow service, lacks preparation when it's dinner time. If the employees wasn't taking containers of food home, maybe it would be food prepared. Place needs a manager, a lot of people just standing and looking, while someone other than just 1 person that don't know how to take orders and cashier too. Cashier is very slow and makes a lot of mistakes."}
{"text":"Gross food, gross atmosphere, rude employees. Got the pork shoulder sandwich. It looked like a plate of soup with sauce and coleslaw and soggy bread. The meat tasted old. Dining room was atrociously dirty with a boom box on too loud. I don't understand how this restaurant is a Cleveland staple or how it was on so many TV shows. Never would I go back there. Felt sick afterwards."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place was. I heard from several locals, as well as great reviews online that this place was incredible.  This place is in the middle of the hood. Nothing wrong with that, but the place itself looked like a dilapidated shack. The building, parking lot, signage, doors, chairs, counters pace, everything was dirty, dingy and dank.   On top of that, THERE WAS NO ONE THERE! When I first pulled up, I though they were closed, there was one car in the lot and the lights were very low. For a place that has reached national levels of notoriety, I would expect it to have at least a few people there.   The service. Horrible. The girl at the counter was extremely disrespectful and had a stank attitude. I really debated walking out but since I had been excited for the food all day and drove for 25 mins to get it, I had already put in enough emotional investment to stick it out.   Lastly, the food. I'm from a place in NY state where \"Garbage Plates\" are a local food legend. The \"Polish Girl\" was Ohio's equivalent. It wasn't good. It was a just a mess of food. The collards, not good either. I wanted to try the potato salad, but they said it wasn't available. I didn't dare touch any of the other meats because they looked like they'd been sitting out for quite some time. The menu I read from was literally a white piece of paper that had crunchy bits and sauce all over it, from so many people touching it.   What a disappointment this place was. Save your money and time. Don't bother to go."}
{"text":"I genuinely love this place.   My one request is that this place should start a delivery service. The neighborhood isn't the best, and since all my friends in Cleveland are Case students, no one is really inclined to answer my fried chicken hankering at 10pm because to them, the fear of getting shot is too damn high (but I think i could die happy with some HSW in my hands)."}
{"text":"The chicken and po boy was amazing. Possibly the best I ever had. Get it with the sauce loaded on the chicken and fries. Staff was super friendly.   I will come back next time I am in the neighborhood I visited because it wAs a nice walk from the Cleveland clinic. Probably not the best idea at night but during the day it was great."}
{"text":"Wished it was better.. After watching man vs. food I decided to stop by, décor was not that homey and welcoming, and the neighborhood was bad, but nothing I haven't been around before.  The ribs were very fatty and grisly, it was disappointing and I didn't get enough sauce and when I asked for a little more they wanted to charge me, the coleslaw was awesome!  I noticed a hair in my food and it turned me off to the rest of it, so i threw it away , I wont be returning... sorry guys"}
