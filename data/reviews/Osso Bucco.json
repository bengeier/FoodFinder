{"text":"It was our first time here.  It's actually a much bigger place than I expected. We went on a Thursday night so we expected it to be a little slow. But surprisingly there were quite a few people there and the appropriate number of staff to attend to all the tables. 
We didn't order any apps since we didn't want it to be too late a night. Most of our group enjoyed the food. I ordered the butternut squash agnolotti. Ohh em gee! Soo good! Definitely get this if you go. 
The service was pretty slow considering the number of people there. One thing that I didn't like much was that the waitress didn't really offer any suggestions when asked. I usually like getting the staff suggestions since they've usually tried much of the food. But oh well! 
Overall, do give this place a go. It's a great spot :)"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. And never have I been dissapointed ( only when I can't get a table because they're completely booked!). I have ordered the calamari, the muscles, a varieties of pastas  but by far the best thing they have is their osso bucco. It was tender, flavorful, well seasoned. Also the vegetable risotto that it came with was just delicious. the food is always fresh. and the staff is always friendly. I will be coming back as long as they are there!"}
{"text":"Their food is incredible! I'm not usually a fan of Italian food because in most places, I find it heavy and unflavourful, but they do it really well at Osso Bucco. Only complaint as in the reviews before is the service. It's hit or miss. Basically if it's busy, you have to chase down staff to get water refills/the bill etc. 

My favourite dish on their menu is the fettucine goat cheese!"}
{"text":"Interesting find in our backyard. First time at OB and due to our tight schedule, the Mrs made reservations and preordered each of our meals in advance. The food was ready within 5 minutes of our arrival! I'll have to try this at other restaurants especially when the kids are in tow.

Ordered the Lobster Linguine which I'd say is above average but as a previous poster noted...not much lobster. Or perhaps it was overpowered by the cream sauce. Not a deal breaker...would certainly order again. 

The portions were quite big. The Mrs had take home. Our 7 and 3 year old shared a plate of penne pasta who ended up eating 1/4 to half their plates. Not sure how I did it. Somehow I managed to clean my plate and have a little room for desert. Was close to ordering the caramel crunch but was so glad I decided on the tiramisu. Probably the best tiramisu I've ever had. Loved the texture, presentation, and taste. 

Glad to know this is close to home. Time for bed. ;)"}
{"text":"This house must be cursed. There have been at least 4 different restaurants at this location in the years I've been driving past it.
  This one is thoroughly average. The food is passable, not exceptional. The service is also erratic.
  Oh, and their website does not work. There is no way to access the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible atmosphere and poor service.

My wife and I have enjoyed a number of dinners at Osso Bucco first in their original Brampton location, then at the Milton location and now at their revised location in Brampton. All I can say is that we won't be back to the Brampton location. We were excited to try the Brampton location for the first time. 

Our reservations were met with a disarray of clutter in the entrance and a table that overlooked garbage cans and empty bottles of beer.

Worse, we had our first experience of poor service ever at Osso Bucco. The server was inattentive, forgetful and not very good. If this was our first experience with Osso Bucco, we wouldn't go back. Instead, we'll just stick to Milton."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian Cuisine is about using simple, fresh ingredients creating a home cooked meal. Osso Bucco serves Italian food that is modernized while retaining its classic flavors.  

During my last visit, I had penne primavera as my entrée and Caesar salad as my appetizer. The Caesar Salad tasted fresh and started my dinner perfectly.  The penne primavera was well-seasoned and the pasta was cooked al dente. Along with the amazing food, the service is friendly and always ready to help. 

Osso Bucco is one of the best Italian restaurants I have tried. If you desire delicious Italian food, sally forth towards Osso Bucco."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Italian food and Osso Bucco is excelling on satisfying my taste buds. VERY generous portions, and yes, I insist on the word VERY, because it's HUGE! To the point that you will be rolling out of the restaurant or doggy bagging the rest for your next day lunch. Their pasta taste really good, and their panna cotta is to die for! The only negative remark I would have to say is that service can be slow. Few time, we waited almost an hour for food to come. Brought some friends with little kid there once, bad idea, the kids got very hungry and it was a very bad experience. I hope they can improve that so I can give them a 5 next time."}
{"text":"My Order: Butternut Squash Agnolotti (Absolutely delicious, but it's one of their specials so you might not be able to get it in the future ;D) 

Pros
- Their food is usually top notch. We got the Seafood Pasta (which is rich of calamari, mussels, shrimp...) that I loved; and granted, that's a lot because I'm not a big seafood person
- They have specials from time to time; I took a chance and got the butternut squash agnolotti which was very flavorful and yummy! 

Cons
- We didn't get our bread until AFTER we got our meal; that was annoying... especially since we were ravished
- The waitress didn't swing by very often so we didn't get our water re-filled (not even once), it also took a while to order and get the bill

To be honest, I enjoyed their original location on Bovaird. The restaurant was smaller but the service was amazing. It might have to do with the fact that the new location is bigger (?) The other time I went, the party I came with was also bigger. Either way, I love their food. But their service leaves a lot more to be desired."}
{"text":"Osso Bucco is a nice little family run Italian place. You can expect that the regular menu will have all of the classics well represented - spaghetti, chicken parm, etc. There is also a HUGE menu board of \"specials\" - at least 10-20 items. Personally, I found the chalkboard specials menu very hard to read, so would have preferred a printed copy.

Dinner starts out with bread that's been drizzled in herbed olive oil. I'm carb-avoiding right now, so I didn't try it but it smelled and looked good. My entrée was so/so - I went with the classic chicken parm and it was just ok. The breading fell off pretty much right away and the red sauce appeared to be little more than crushed tomatoes. Kind of blah and boring for me.

Service was so/so as well - my dining partner added chicken to his dish and it was missing, so it had to be remade. Our server was very friendly but mostly absent and drinks were not replenished. That said, the place was packed on a Wednesday night so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I have come to this restaurant many times, but recently I have been ordering from their restaurant as the wait times for dishes is usually long when you sit in. 

I have always enjoyed Osso Bucco's food in the past. They serve fresh made pasta, and their homemade sauces are well balanced and delicious. They serve large portions with a lot of meat or fish. But this experience wasn't as pleasant. I ordered the Spicy Mussels and the Lobster Linguine. IMO there was too much cream added to the mussels and the lobster pasta was bland and lacking in lobster. As always however, the pasta was perfectly al dente.

I'll order again, hoping this was an off day!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Server was friendly. I will definitely go back. Had the veal loin with goat cheese and risotto as a side. Phenomenal. Tiramisu was great too."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant and everything was very good!  The salads were excellent and everyone enjoyed their main course.  The food prices are very reasonable - especially the salmon, which was very fresh.  I've paid much more for much worse salmon recently.  One downside is the wine prices are marked up a bit too much."}
{"text":"Been going to Osso Bucco for a while now. Food is delicious. Portions are big. Price is right. Only down side is that food takes a little too long to come out.  But worth the wait.  Must try the Seafood Pasta! Lots of muscles, big scallops and shrimps. If you're looking for appetizers, try the spicy muscles. If you're looking to try this place on a weekend, make reservations at least a day before. It gets very busy!"}
