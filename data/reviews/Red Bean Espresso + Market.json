{"text":"Best coffee in Bloor West Village and carrot cake is out of this world :)  Iris is sweet & friendly - LOVE this place, go almost everyday :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The owner Iris works morning til night, every day making great espresso and cooking up the most divine sugar-filled treats. The cafe is roomy enough for Mummy's to meet up for a coffee with a number of strollers. Iris is very welcoming to children and my daughter thinks she is the most wonderful cake making lady she has ever met! Iris has recently started \"Mommy Mondays\" where you can have a 12oz Latte and a baked treat for only $4. She also has \"Tooney Tuesdays\" where a 12oz Latte is only, you guessed it, $2! Iris also makes yummy sounding soups most days, but I haven't tried these yet."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  The lady who owns it is very friendly and always helps me to get my stroller in and out of the door.  Me and my friend go here quite often for the amazing brownies and cookies (that are made by the owner) and even if I am just walking past, she recognises me and waves.  Great food, great service and great coffee."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill between errands today and decided to spend it at this cafe after being drawn in by the $2 latte special. I'm not generally a fan of lattes; they're expensive and I like my coffee strong, but for the price I figured I should give it another shot. I'm glad I did! Thick foam, not too hot, and just strong enough to give my brain that caffeine hit it needed. Yum.  I didn't stay long, but really loved all the sunlight pouring in through the big front windows. The owner was also really friendly and sincere, but also let me sit and read in peace (not sure how well that would work on the Mommy Mondays mentioned in an earlier review, but today I was the only sitting customer). The baked treats looked great though I abstained, and apparently there were also soup and sandwich offerings as well - the latter a choice between ham and roast beef, so I'm not sure about veg options.  I'm in the High Park area infrequently, but would definitely return."}
{"text":"The actual coffee is good, or at least better than most coffee shops in Bloor West (Baka being probably the exception).  The d√©cor is ok,, but there is something unsettling in the vibe.   I didn't like that the coffee was more expensive than other speciality coffee shops in the city.   The owner said she made her own pastries, and granted I have only tried the cherry almond pie, but it was sufficiently awful to have completely destroyed any desire I may have had to try the other pastries.  How does one mess up something as delicious sounding as cherry almond pie, one may ask?  It's a bit of a complex question, though I suppose that smothering it in more cinnamon and sugar than a Cinnabon cinnamon-bun would probably be a part of it.  I love sweets, but I think I got three cavities just from the first bite.  I'd say, go there if you must, but only if you must, as there are better places within walking distance."}
{"text":"A nice coffee shop that serves a good cup of coffee. Compared to some of the other coffee shops nearby, its atmosphere is bland, but is naturally bright due to the huge windows up front. A plus for some folks is that does serve gelato as well."}
{"text":"High ceiling and spacious vibe, Red Bean is wheelchair/stroller friendly as long as you don't mind having the washroom past the kitchen at the very back. There's not a lot of seating but the little that they have is comfortable. I would prefer a little more interior lighting in the space for dark cloudy days like yesterday. The darkness somehow makes it look more empty. The cute purple flowers in mason jars at every table did give a touch of coziness, though.  My americano was pretty damn tasty and well worth the trek while being pelted by ice cold rain. No regrets. I'd do it ten times over."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in high park area hands down. Where can u find an Americano for only 2.40 these days? Far and few places. And that's just one of this gems perks. The staff is very friendly and conversational. The setup is lovely w wooden tables and counters. And the specialty drinks (my fave is Americano by far) are the perfect pick me up after class, work, etc. it's a must try when in this neck of the woods and it's a hop skip and a jump from the high park subway so why not?"}
{"text":"On an incredibly busy day at High Park, this coffee shop was a breath of fresh air. Not crowded, simply and elegantly designed, with very friendly and polite staff. The drinks were a bit cheaper than average, though a bit on the small side. They also serve gelato in the back :). Looking across the street at the packed Starbucks... I have no idea why ppl didn't head over to this place instead!"}
{"text":"Other than Starbucks across the street, and a gross Starbucks near Bloor and Runnymede, I couldn't find a local indie coffee shop anywhere except Red Bean.   I like the space in here, but it was really stuffy and warm with the sun pouring in the large glass windows. Lots of people in here with their laptops, and looked at me as if I was intruding.   I had 2 hours to kill with my book, so I sat outside on the slated sidewalk basking in what's left of the sunshine in the fall.   I moved inside later to the communal table, joining some other workers. Encountered a group of Russian/Ukranian ladies who came with their own pastries and made their own sandwiches while they bought their own tea.   Small selection of Pastries here, but what they have was good. Nothing was wheat or gluten free."}
{"text":"I would give this place a lower rating if I could.  The coffee was meh, nothing special and way over priced.  It was noon and they had no food selection left.  But the service was the worst Ive had in the city. Dealing with such a passive aggressive hostess is not worth any cup of coffee.  You couldnt even pay to step foot in the cafe again."}
{"text":"I enjoy the coffee at Red Bean, but it is hard to read or do work there. It is often very loud (especially on weekends), there is limited seating available, and, as others have noted, there's a cap on how much time you're allowed to spend in the cafe. This is a strange policy given that it is an 'Espresso bar,' which suggests you would be able to sit and enjoy yourself.   Hit Red Bean up for the coffee, but perhaps not for the ambience."}
{"text":"Very nice place and quiet. Owner is pleasant and friendly. Great coffee and fresh homemade  pastries."}
{"text":"We just moved to Bloor West Village from Roncesvalles and I was lamenting the fact that there weren't the same level of independent coffee shops in the neighbourhood. I had heard a lot about Coffee Tree and although it is certainly above average, it is no Lit or Dark Horse.  We were pleasantly surprised by Red Bean. Though still new-feeling and somewhat limited in hours of operation (I like to go for an early-morning Americano), Red Bean has great promise. From the minimal but 'under-the-top' and kid-friendly decor, to the scrumptious and unique-but-not-weird baked goods, the friendly and clearly hard-working proprietor, Iris is doing everything right. Offering almond milk as an alternative, real-tea chai and a black Americano just how I like it: slightly frothy, dark and round.  Admittedly, I like coffee fairly minimal, so I would need to defer to someone with fancier tastes to assess the drinks with longer names Also, I don't really pay attention to how much things cost, especially when my wife is paying.   Iris is on the verge of bringing in Italian Gelato which will be a boon when the hot weather really hits, with plans to extend hours.  For now, though I say hoorah! Coffee problem solved."}
{"text":"Frequented there all summer long for Italian gelato - it's sooo good!  I truly love this coffee shop but rarely stay inside. I don't feel like coming there to work (I feel more comfortable in Starbucks or Timothy's with my laptop), but I must admit Red Bean serves great coffee and ice cream"}
