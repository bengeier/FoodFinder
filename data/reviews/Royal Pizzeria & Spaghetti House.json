{"text":"If you want to take a trip back to the 70's, most of the place hasn't changed since it's inception in 73.   This is what I call 'Georgetown good', outside of this small town you would find a 100 better places. 
Prices are high, staff is friendly.. Mediocre pizza at best."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!   
Amazing customer service, nice family run restaurant. 

This is a great example of customer service that you can't find and will not find at any other pizza place, they accommodated me allowing me to bring in my gluten free crust and topping it with their amazing ingredients. Even though they don't have gluten free pizza on their menu.  

The portion sizes are big and the topping on the pizza are very generous. The non gluten free people with me loved their pizza and lasagna. 

It's hard to find a mom and pop shop like this that serves great food along with great customer service. 

A must try for people in Georgetown or Brampton."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 medium pizzas and wings. 

First I was told the incorrect total on the phone so it was $10 more at pickup. 
Then I waited an extra 15 minutes longer than the time they gave me for the food to be ready. 

I sat and watched them over-fry the wings until there was nothing left but bone and sinew ($9 for those). 
The crust tasted like the cardboard box it came in, and the toppings were pretty much non existent. 

The worst pizza in Georgetown."}
