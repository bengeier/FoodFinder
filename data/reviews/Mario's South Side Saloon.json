{"text":"Mario's is a decent bar that doesn't charge a cover and has a TON of space.  This place fills with college students from wall to wall (and that says a lot since this takes up the space of two store fronts).  Reasonable drink specials (if you're down with domestics).  Not somewhere I would recommend if you're trying to talk with friends, but a great place to meet people.  Mario IS Pittsburgh's college bar."}
{"text":"The bouncer will not let you in with a valid out-of-state id. Beware."}
{"text":"Mario's is always a go-to bar if you can't decide where to go among the dozens and dozens of other bars in Southside. This place was my Saturday Afternoon hang out for lunch, college football, and 1 dollar Blue Moon drafts. Food wise, typical bar food, I always get the cajun chicken sandwich and the french onion soup and it never disappoints. I give it 5 stars for being a great local bar with a great staff for happy hour or a couple drinks on a weeknight. Friday and Saturday nights are packed with people, which is normal, being a Southside staple, but it might not be for everyone. Especially if you're over 23 and tired of that scene. I can't count how much money I've spent on the Mario's jukebox(s). All and all, I love it."}
{"text":"Great place! I came in to watch the Blackhawks game and Ray was a stellar bartender. Also had the pub fries, with bacon and cheese...yum!"}
{"text":"No more wing night on Mondays? Correction: no more food specials at all due to price increases? It's a shame to hear this... Used to love coming here after work to hang with my buddies and grab a beer. Will be looking elsewhere for my week night hangout."}
{"text":"it gives off a great vibe of variety with all the different floors! I like going there with friends on the weekend; we can always count on having a good time at marios"}
{"text":"I love Mario's South Side Saloon! This is a must visit bar when I'm in town, and my childhood friends still in the Burgh frequent this place often. The food is incredible. The nights are fun, the drinks are large, and the proprietors cool. During football season you can see Steeler Jeff Reed film his show. Crowd is fresh, bartenders cute, waitresses hot (or so I am told)...come on...what's not to like? (They are under new ownership, and they've totally redone the place, too)  Spent my 26th birthday here...set up a balcony table, served my cake, got free shots from the owner to celebrate! Awesome guy!"}
{"text":"Rolled in during a trip to a Pirates game.  Great service & an absolute jumping crowd.  We were told after 11:00 the place gets jammed and like clockwork it did.  Great people watching spot.  Get upstairs if there is room and watch the Magen down below."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are visiting Pittsburgh and we went to Fat Heads for dinner (see my Fat Heads Review if you haven't been there).  Afterwards, we were looking for a bar where we could watch the Pitt-'Nova basketball game and then have a few beers.  We came into Mario's becuase both of us were full and didn't want to walk on a full stomach from Fat Heads.  When we walked in there weren't many people there so we were able to secure a good spot, which helped out later in the night.  There are two parts to this bar, im not sure what the other bar is called but it's a smoking bar while Mario's isn't.  I'm not a smoker so I really appreciated that it was a smoke-free zone.  We proped up on a ledge towards the back of the bar in direct sight of the bartender so he came over very frequently to check on us.  One of the owners was standing next to us and we were chatting with him for an hour or so and he's running a great establishment.    There is a good amount of TV's positioned behind the bar so if you're going there to watch a game you won't be disappointed.  We didn't eat so I'm not sure if the food is good or not.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I could definitely make Mario's my home bar."}
{"text":"Nice location. Good service. Except the bathroom cleaner poured out my ENTIRE drink while i set it down to take a bathroom break, when i came back to the sink he ran away when i asked him why he poured it out!! I went to the second floor bar to find compensation, and the asian bartender told me he did not believe me. Poor service no trust. No way to treat a respectable customer who bought 4 drinks"}
{"text":"I was just outside Marios with a group of friends. It was raining heavily and there was noone going in or out of the bar. It was a completely clear entrance. We tried to stand under the awning to prevent getting completely soaked and the really gross, very overweight bouncer named Jim forced us to stand in the rain while waiting for our Uber for less than 5 minutes. He forced us to stand in the rain as he blocked the entrance with his torpid body. I complained about the fact that he would not allow us to stand under the awning while waiting for our uber so as not to get completely soaked, and he flipped us off. All I can really say is that I would hope the owner of the establishment would hire different bouncers. Jim was extremely unappealing in every possible way, NOT just physically. He was just a fucking dick who forced us to stand in the rain."}
{"text":"We were planning on going to Southside Pittsburgh today, so being the good organizer that I am, I  decided to research restaurants in the area.  I pinpointed a few great places to eat through Yelp.  Then my wife  decided to ask a merchant in the area good places to eat nearby.  That's when  everything went awry.  Marios is a mediocre bar at best.  It is not very appealing as bars go.  It looks like it has been around forever and has never been updated.  They had good prices on beer, and meal prices were good.  The food was good but certainly not great.  Our waitress was pleasant and probably saved me from going over the edge.  Although it was the the worse place I have eaten, I won't be returning...even if my wife insists."}
{"text":"Rude staff.  New to the area and asked about the wheel.  Spun it and landed on jager and asked to spin again, and told I had to take what it landed on.  Bartender then slammed glasses and walked away and ignored our group and didn't take our drink order.  From a former service industry worker I felt it was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time. Adam was great! Attentive and friendly. Will definitely come back. Thanks fot a great night"}
{"text":"We've been in Pittsburgh all weekend and have barely found anything edible. We came to Mario's for a beer and some football but were absolutely blown away by the food. Juicy wings, great sauce, dynamite pierogies and chicken thumbs that you can only dream about. Plus our waitress was very personable. Although her favorite actor is Vin Diesel, it really didn't take away from the meal at all.      Still here 7 hours later with a waitress change and Tori is pretty sweet as well, still miss my Mel girl tho."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 1 star because I had to at least give one. Literal worst dining experience I've ever had. I waited an hour for my food and when it finally came out it was horrible verging on inedible. boo."}
{"text":"Great place for food, drinks and sports. It's a very popular place and can get crowded for hometown sporting events. Saturday night was $2.00 blue moons."}
{"text":"My friend went there after midnight on the eve of her 21st birthday (21 at midnight) and they wouldn't let her in.  The bouncer was being rude, so I mentioned to one of my other friends that he was an asshole...and he must have heard me cause he lunged at me like he was going to take me out!  (Mind you I'm a non-threatening 5'2 female)  So before I even knew what was going on, my boyfriend intercepted the bouncer and they brawled it out on the sidewalk for a minute before the fight was broken up.  That bouncer is lucky he didn't lay a hand on me cause I would have kicked him in the nuts.  That bar sucks anyway, so I'm glad my friend didn't spend her first legal night there."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the Frozen Four, and we randomly came across Mario's when we were walking on Carson.  Mario's is a younger-mixed crowd.  I'd say the average age was mid-20's, but I saw people in their 50's too.  We're in our 40's.  It was a Thursday night, so the place wasn't packed, but there was a good crowd.  Drinks were mid-priced and the service at the bar was good.  The bartenders poured a fair drink and they were attentive.  Patrons were friendly and curious about us out-of-towners.  Even the younger patrons wanted to know where we were from and wished us luck in the Tourney.  The locals were very appreciative of the tourists in town for the hockey tournament.  Mario's is a classic bar, nothing flashy, but I'd go there again."}
{"text":"There was literally a cockroach in my food!!!! I tried to take a picture but they took my food back before I could! This place is disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"There are many good things about Mario's. It's awfully spacious which means you can easily get a seat at the bar or a booth when just going on a random night or during the day  The staff are very friendly and the food is surprisingly awesome. Between the tater tots (hello) , fried pickles and my all-time-favorite, the Golden Gate Turkey, you can't go wrong with your pick.   Drinks are strong and beer selection is wide. Go there on Wednesday night for trivia. They also have a bunch of TVs if you're into sports 'n at.   Only downfall is that it does get super packed on Fri & Sat nights, but who doesn't on Carson St."}
{"text":"Each Wednesday, Mario's South Side Saloon plays host to Team Trivia. Last week, we went for the first time and had a blast. We didn't win, but if we did, our pre-trivia meal would have been covered, since the first place receives Mario's Gift Certificates.   Before trivia, I feasted on one of the burgers, the Cow Tipper. The cow tipper is a hamburger with avacado, red and banana peppers, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Despite not being asked how I wanted my burger cooked, it turned out medium-well. The burger was thick and difficult to get your mouth around, but each bite got a little of every ingredient for a consistant meal. I wish the avacado would have been on top of the burger instead of under it, because it left the bottom bun soft and mushy. The curly fries were a good choice for a side, especially seeing the sweet potato fries were soft and greesy (how, I don't know). In the end, I was pleased and learned that I need to see more movies in order to compete in Team Trivia."}
{"text":"From Chicago with Love!! Was here last weekend on a business trip (on a Friday) and man, this placing was JUMPIN! Good times no doubt I'll be back when in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"I visited here two years ago and had these delicious fried pickles so when I was here again, I knew I had to have them. They were better the first time. This time a bit soggy. Also asked bartender for the nightly specials and he said there are none. We had already looked online and saw half off pizzas. He apologized but he should've known!"}
{"text":"Half off drinks from 5pm to 7pm and $5 happy hour menu. Need I say more?  Doubles on doubles on doubles on doubles. Mario's is smoke-free and Blue Lou's is smoker friendly, so take your pick. And don't miss out on live Ron Jeremy entertainment on Friday evenings. I spent years and years of my college time running wild here, but now that I'm past that, I like the happy hour crowd/time just as much. This is especially exciting when you've sadly realized that you're too post-grad old for goblet night.  If you want local Pittsburgh drunk fun anywhere from 5pm to 2am, this is your spot. And they have the best bartenders who make everything extra strong. Just an FYI though, if you're past 24 and there after 10pm, you'll most likely be the mid-life crisis in the corner."}
{"text":"There's a reason no one's reviewed this yet, and that's because this is a horrible, horrible bar.  The patron are rude AND nondescript. There's always a fratboy 'we didn't know what else to do tonight but wanted to pick up girls' vibe and the bathroom lines are so so so long on weekends. And the wait to get drinks can be pretty freaking long too.  It gets one star only because they do have alcohol."}
{"text":"We stopped by Mario's South Side Saloon tonight. We went during Happy Hour, so the bar area was a bit crowded and noisy. Lively music was playing at a high volume and the Penguins game was playing on the large TV's. Once we were seated at the only empty booth, a server came over to our table and pleasantly greeted us. She smiled as she provided each of us with two menus, telling us that one of the menus was for Happy Hour.  Since many appetizers were only $5, we decided to start with the cheese curds. A nice portion arrived quickly and was accompanied by a small container of ranch dressing. The curds were served in a small cast iron skillet and were garnished with fresh cheese shavings. They were quite good. We both ordered the steak salad, which was large and flavorful. The salads were topped with a large amount of steak, along with crispy fries, cheese, tomatoes, eggs, and sauteed onions and peppers. A large piece of garlic bread was served on top of the salad.  Overall, we had a great visit tonight. The food was great and the service was very good. We'll most likely be stopping here again in the future."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate bars because so few stand out from any others. This one wasn't bad, but the service (as is true for most crowded bars) was average. Certainly, I've seen worse. In fact once I got my cheap Miller Lite, a server kept coming upstairs where we were situated to see if we wanted more. The atmosphere was loud, but man where the hell were all the girls? It was like dude central. They had some TV's that were huge so that was a plus, but there wasn't dancing or anything, it was a bunch of people roaming around drinking at a decent price."}
{"text":"\"This world needs a new plague\" - Dwight K. Schrutte   That's how I felt after my last trip to Mario's. Perhaps it was because I was the only sober person on Carson Street at 1 am on Halloween but I have never been angrier at a bar ever. To start the doorman was an ass. I can't blame him all that much because I would be pissed too with the amount of \"21\" year old asshats coming through the doors but at least TRY to maintain some professionalism. Same with the bartenders. Ok I get it you are busy. But you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake. Also use you head. Don't spend so much time on the drunk sluts who order 10 drinks one at a time and don't tip. My biggest complaint however was the clientele. So many assholes that for the first time I honestly hoped a place would spontaneously combust with everyone inside just for the good of humanity. I wish I could say that this was unusual but this seems to be the same story song and dance every weekend at Mario's.   You may ask why this review is getting a 2 star. I must grudgingly say that Mario's does have some redeeming qualities, just earlier in the day. The decor is almost \"Cheers\"-like. Lots of wood and stained glass. The service, when the bar is about empty, has always been at least pleasant. The food is ok too. Nothing great; standard greasy bar food.   All in all this place is a passable bar prior to about 10 pm. Otherwise avoid Mario's like it was giving out free Ebola injections with every admittance."}
{"text":"Marios is your typical Southside bar.  It is usually packed later on in the evening on Friday and Saturday nights. I recommend going early to grab a seat at the bar or upstairs (they have a really neat upstairs part of the bar that overlooks the downstairs).  The bartenders are friendly and quick to get you a drink.  They usually have great drink specials. Saturdays are $3 Blue Moon drafts although they did run out early on in the evening. The drinks are pretty reasonable priced (shots too) and they usually have a nice list of draft beer."}
{"text":"parking in the southside isn't as difficult as i thought it was going to be.  check down the side streets and you're sure to find a spot within 10 minutes TOPS.  mario's is a great spot for some appetizers and drinks.  the happy hour on friday was a little loud and the bar music was competing with some dude singing and playing guitar in the other room.  here's the thing, the chicken nachos were $4 or $5 during happy hour and my cocktails were $2 a piece.  this is a steal!  you can't make chicken nachos at home for $5.  the nachos are served with sour cream and salsa and i was pleased that the waitress brought a little cup of each for both me and my man.  we love mario's especially at the happy hour price.  yummy nachos, strong drinks, chill atmosphere, cheap prices is our equivalent to a great night out.  i recommend eating in the bar area.  the tables in the other area (where the dude was singing) seem claustraphobic."}
{"text":"The Chinese girl bartender is terrible. A rude person to all customers even when I tipped her very well. She does not deserve to work here and brings the place down. She clearly hates her job and doesn't wanna be their so get her out."}
{"text":"I visited Pittsburgh a few weeks ago for the Indianapolis vs. Steelers game...the game rocked.  This bar, did not.  I am a pretty easy to please girl.  Give me drinks, give me bar food, give me fun.  This bar barely accomplished the drink part!  There was a large group of heavy drinkers with me.  Most of us were drinking normal, easy drinks including vodka tonics and Miller Lite.  Our server greeted us but then was long and lost only reappearing every 20 minutes or so, took FOREVER to take our order and eventually pissed us off so bad, we tipped her $2.00 on an over $200 bill.  As close as we were sitting to the door, we could have escaped without paying and gotten away with it and my drunky friends really wanted to.  Having been a server in the past, I did my best to tally up the bill and we left just enough to cover before bolting out the door.  Not only did she not bring us drinks quickly, she didn't bring the right mixed drinks the majority of the time.  Even after REASSURING her we would be a good table, leave a hefty tip and be big spenders, she avoided us like the plague.  Was it busy ...YES, but DO YOUR JOB.  Avoid your small, stingy tables who aren't ordering food or drinks and wait on the ones with gusto who have promised you big rewards for adequate service...or don't and get left with a $2.00 slap in the face.  Our food took over an hour to come out....we ordered sliders, mozzerella balls and BLT sandwiches.  I'm not sure what the hold up was with the dinner portion but needless to say, with empty drinks, my little crowd of 10 was getting pissy.  It is too bad, too b/c the food didn't suck but one could not PAY me to return to this little hell hole on Carson Street.  There are way too many other fun options and the service ALONE killed this place for me.  Miss Waitress knows who she is...and even though her excuses of being very busy and having tables in all areas were supposed to make us feel sorry for her, after awhile all she sounded like was the teacher from Peanuts...wah wah wah wah, STFU and DO YOUR JOB...I hope your boss reads this and does something about it, b/c I'm fairly sure that it is just a lack of interest in your work that made our experience SUCK so bad.  Never. Again."}
{"text":"So, Mario's is your average southside bar. Maybe a little more sports barish than others, but nothing special. Drinks are cheap if you get the specials, and the food isn't bad.   Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"Mario's sells food? Now see, this is what happens when you make the same bar your last stop of the night every time you go out. You miss important tidbits of information.  I've never had a bad experience at Mario's, but then again, I've also never come in without a Pens jersey on. People are really, really nice to you in Pittsburgh when you're wearing Sidney Crosby on your back.  Mario always has great drink specials. Everyday is beer related except Tuesday, so if you're trying to turn up then always remember: beer before liquor, never been sicker! Liquor before beer, you're in the clear! $2 wells means Mario cannot be your last stop on a Tuesday. I've realized that the hard way.  This is a two story bar, but if the Southside is not hoppin' (which is rare), the second floor will either be closed off or so damn boring there's no point in going upstairs. There's usually a good mixture of young professionals and UPitt seniors in the lower floor, so if you're a mingler you can stay near the main bar and make new friends.   Mario's isn't for everyone. It's just one of those bars that will rub a lot of people the wrong way; they're unapologetically Pittsburgh and they thrive on being a Southside icon. But it's also one of those bars that will have a special place in your heart if you love it. Mario's will always have a spot with me. Now where's my captain & sprite?"}
{"text":"Probably underrated in being the best burgers in town.  Big hearty fresh ground burger topped with a cheese-covered option of your choice. Alpine burger, mushroom carm onions, Swiss and bacon is essential.   It's a really good burger.  Snag that with a bowl of French onion soup & you can't go wrong.   I really like their wings too. Honey-habanero is not too hot, but has a nice sweet-hot taste.  I also dig their spicy ranch, because it's chipotles mixed with ranch dressing and it's off the chain."}
{"text":"I LOVE MARIO'S! I visit Pittsburgh at least once a year and I make sure to visit this spot every time!   The staff are awesome and personable! Even when it's super busy, you can still get a drink in reasonable time!   I like how there are levels that welcome smoking and other ones that do not. (I'm a non-smoker and appreciate this quality!)   It gets rowdy there, but that's part of the South Side fun!"}
{"text":"I used to come here every Wednesday night in college for the $3 goblets of Miller Lite. My how the times have changed. I didn't know what to expect for a weekday lunch but I was really pleasantly surprised at the food and service!   Came for lunch around 11:30 on a Thursday and apart from one other twosome, we had the place to ourselves.   Service was very prompt with our waitress approaching us immediately and getting our drinks in a pinch. I chose the Santa Fe chicken sandwich and my companion had the steak salad. The sandwich was HUGE and half of it was more than enough for the meal. The flavor was really tasty with a little bit of heat but nothing crazy. For my side, I had the sweet potato fries. They were amazing!!! Crinkle cut with just a little char and some type of cinnamon sugar dusting which I'm sure put the nutritional value at a negative 5 but tasted phenomenal!!   The salad was large and looked really good as well and was served with a delicious looking piece of garlic bread.   I was impressed. Good food, good service and the price is right. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've never been here for dinner, only Friday and Saturday nights after 9pm.  The drinks are pretty reasonable.  Decor is pretty cool inside. It has 3 floors, the top of which has a treehouse feel! Fun place to go with friends and have a drink. The lines outside wrapped around the building speak to how popular it is!  Too crowded at times for my taste though."}
{"text":"Waitresses are really rude here absolutely never going back! Had several different encounters where I was pushed just so she could get through! And she was so rude when I tried to talk to her! Not a fan. Bad service."}
{"text":"1.12.18 - my friends and I are at Mario's enjoying ourselves on the second floor. The male bartender with the left arm sleeve and beard tending to the far right of the bar was so rude to our friend it was appalling. Who wants to go to a bar with bartenders that are so mean and unfriendly? Don't recommend coming here because the bartenders are disrespectful. And I've been on Maury...."}
{"text":"Bringing me back to college days- Marios is the less dungeony cousin to the old Playwright in New Haven... Actually I feel that the entire Carson st. street is very similar to the crown st. area in New Haven.   My first time in Pittsburgh led me to conclude the following- A. Big Big folks B. Friendly folks smoking cigarettes C. Jag-off is a word equal to the NYC Guidish term \"haahd-On\" D. These people love bridges almost as much a cigarettes E. People can recognize Johnny Rod from W.A.S.P. F. Dont order a Vodka tonic and expect to talk to chicks G. Deconstructivsm at its best! -describing the urban renewal of the past 50 years and well as the internal organs of the heavy drinkers and smokers."}
{"text":"I had the sliders per the bartenders recommendation and they were very good and if you like Blue Moon, it is on special on Saturday.. Very pleased with the quality and price."}
{"text":"Very nice place good selection of draft beers and happy hour. Been here a few times and Adam the bartender is awesome! Very personable and informative for travelers. Recommend this place over the kitchen bar across the street. Food is good and pizzas re very good."}
{"text":"Mario's, why you gotta be SO loud? Obviously bars will be loud. I'm 23 -- I can deal with above-average noise levels, but this is just ridiculous. The first time I came here two-ish years ago, at least I could appreciate the music that was being played, but when I was here this past weekend all I would think was WTF? There's a jukebox and I've got to assume that's the problem because the music that was playing was extremely random and extremely bad.  The things that really redeem this place for me are a) the food and b) the prices. I guess in Atlanta I'm used to ridiculously high prices for not a lot of food and paying $5+ for a semi-decent beer. When I saw they had a $2 Blue Moon draft special I was floored! I can't even get a bottled Bud Light for that price at most bars where I live. My favorite local bar at home has Blue Moon on special for $4 (it's typically $5), so $2 seems like a steal.  My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed our appetizer (cheese and bacon fries) and our sandwiches (I had the Italian Hoagie and my boyfriend had the Pgh Pastrami). We were so full from the fries that we both only ate half of our sandwiches. We took them to go, but accidentally left them at the place we were staying at while we were in Pittsburgh and we were pretty upset we didn't get to enjoy our leftovers. :(  Our server was really great and super friendly. It was crowded, but she checked on us frequently and made sure we got everything we needed.  I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Maybe not at night, though. All they need to do is turn down the music so I don't have to scream \"WHAT?\" every time one of my friends speaks and I'd give this place five stars!"}
{"text":"An hour at Marios is like being inside an episode of Real World/Road Rules Challenge.  There's people making out, fist fighting, throwing drinks, falling down etc. pretty much everywhere you look.  If I was still in college, and this was the only place that would accept my fake ID, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been there many times with friends who live in south side...on of the better bars iv been too...just wish they would ban smoking in Penn..."}
{"text":"I had to make a stop here while on a mini crawl with some old college friends.this was a bar we ended up at a LOT in 2008-2010, when we were 21-22. The bar is exactly the same, still smashed full of college students. It was too crowded for our taste now. We didn't even get a drink lol. It was nice to reexperience the ambience, but we were ready to \"grow up\" and move down the street to a different bar."}
{"text":"this place is a party!!  amazing scene.  it's busy.  and great deals.  next time i'm back in pittsburgh: ALL BE BAAACK (Arnold)."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for the day and I met up with an old friend who was going to take me to the South Side. We ended up at Marios.  Its a pretty cool looking place with a lot of room to hang out, drink and watch the game. The staff is friendly and they work hard and there are enough tv's to catch all the highlights.  They offer beer in numerous sizes which is a cool touch. The bar also has a decent array of brews for you to sample.  They off a large 64 ounce boot filled to the top with your favorite brew. I obviously had to try this and went with a very large serving of Yuengling!"}
{"text":"At one time Mario's was the place to go in the southside, when it was the only thing in the southside.  But now the food is below average and it's just for a place for drunk immature assholes. There are better places to go now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Happy Hour spot in all of Pittsburgh, and I have been to many. I have become a regular. I know all of the bartenders and staff. During happy hour, most mixed drinks, and beers are all half off. They also have $5 appetizers which are great too. I usually get the chicken nachos which is so big I usually need help finishing them. The bartenders are polite and can make you pretty much anything that you are feeling in the mood for. On Fridays, they have a gentleman that plays cover rock music. It sometimes gets a bit loud, but he is pretty good and plays requests. If I drank and ate the same amount most places, my bill would be double the amount. They pour strong drinks(most places in Pittsburgh does though. They have a variety of draft beers and bottles. Monday is wing night with $.40 wings which are great, I usually just go with the hot buffalo. You can't go wrong with these. I wouldn't bring kids here, but is good for every one else. Juke box is playing most of the time. I go here all the time and will continue to go here. It gets very busy during nights on the weekend, so I tend to stay away during that time. They definitely run a good, profitable business here. It is a sports bar, so they have many TV's to watch games on."}
{"text":"We did not come for the food only drinks on a Saturday Afternoon.     We were warned this placed is flooded by college kids at night - which seemed interestnig and we were thinking about coming back for the comedic affect.      We did get our comedy for the day at this place.   When the bartender ran a purse out of the establishment to give to another person (who she thought left it).   The funny thing was that it was not that person's purse.  Any way the beers were cold and tasty.  We did not eat there but others were.    they have a spin wheel which determines the shot you will need to drink.  I would go back but be warned - this place will get much younger as the night progresses.  Atmosphere - Traditional Pub during the day - good craft beer selection - easy going / fun  Cost - normal - about $5 per craft beer  Service - Great - Our server was great.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Will I go here on a weekend night out?  Probably not.  BUT, I will go during football season on a Sunday if I get there early and get a spot to sit in.    I have to say I was pleasantly surprised when towards the end of the football season we decided to give Mario's a try for some Sunday football (since my husband's team not going to be on local TV).  We had a few great times!  Good service, good bar food, and no drunken Ed Hardy wearing punks starting anything (minus one time actually, but that reflects on these idiots and not Mario's).    I may not see the inside of Mario's until closer to September, but I will be back :)"}
{"text":"The four star rating is based primarily on the food I have had here.  Mario's definitely has some issues, from it being freezing or a sweat box inside, to it having an odd smell.  The bartenders are not the most friendly either.  However, I have had some great times in this bar and it is a staple of Carson Street.  It is a fun place to watch a game or just to get some drinks with friends.  Make sure to spin the wheel.  Now to the food.  I have never had anything at Mario's that I did not think was very good.  For appetizers I would highly recommend the buffalo chicken dip.  It is hot, creamy, and has a delicious flavor.  It comes with flatbread pieces which are crispy but soft on the inside and go perfect with the dip.  They used to have a spicy crab dip which was one of the best dips I have ever had.  Wish they would bring it back.    For my main dish I have ordered a burger the last couple of times.  Years ago I remember they had very subpar burgers.  They weren't fresh and had a generic taste.  However they have made some changes and now have some delicious burgers.  The burger I ordered last time was more cooked to medium than my preferred medium rare, but this did not make that big of a difference because the burger was juicy and had a great flavor.  The meat tastes like it is ground fresh daily which makes a huge difference.  The bun they chose was also a perfect choice and held up everything well.  Finally, their fries were fresh cut style and very good.  They also have some of the best ranch dressing around...perfect with the fries."}
{"text":"Waitress spilled beer on my friends shoe by accident (to the point where his shoe and sock were soaking), BUT they do pour decent drinks and did have $2 blue moons the night we came. We couldn't see the football game from the booth we were sitting at because it was too crowded.. come here after you've pregamed"}
{"text":"A place that does wings and makes its own dressings - plenty of room to breath and walk around! Not the typical Pittsburgh crowded elbow to elbow but lavish space. Food is excellent and staff is on point along with drinks- not the best parking on Evenings but with every great plus there has to be a minus."}
{"text":"My sister's friend's apartment is literally around the corner from this place somewhere on Carson street. To describe Carson street in a nutshell . . . . it is the Williamsburg of Pittsburgh. Maybe the more rowdy and care-free artsy form of Williamsburg with a few more grown-ups thrown in between.   Anyway, the menu of craft and regular beers here was excellent. They even had Bell's Oberon! Which does not sell no matter how hard you try to search for it in New York. I know this, because the distributor hates New York and refuses to sell here. Oh, Michigan. I love you. Anyway, they had additional fancy things like Atwater stout, East End IPA, First Amendment, Framboise on tap, Leinenkugel, a couple Penn ales I'm unfamiliar with. But you know what? I had 3 pints of fancy beers. Guess how much it came out to? Only $10! I thought it was a mistake it was so cheap. They also had Blue Moon as a special of the day on tap for $2. I'm simply amazed. Anyway, the rest of our group also ordered a bunch of chicken wings which looked pretty good and came in a large variety of sauces and spices. The bar is pretty relaxed and divey. Both an upstairs and downstairs. Definitely a Pirates/Penguins fan bar.   Don't forget to check out the bathroom. The doors are wide open and oddly the men's and women's you can easily peer into on when coming down the stairs. BUT they have chalk board walls in each stall! How exciting! See inserted pictures! And the sink is pretty innovative as well. It's like a shelf but the water just magically disappears in its rightful place!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are great here, I wish there was a better beer selection though. Very few beers on tap, so it makes for a scarce selection for beer drinkers. Bartenders are a lot of fun and the wheel spin is a trickster, you may end up drunk off of it."}
{"text":"oh south side bars, you are so sneaky! from the outside, most bars look like a dive bar  with some tables surrounding the actual bar. Walking down E. Carson on a Saturday, most bars seem like they are filled to capacity.. that is one reason why i've never stepped into Mario's. I always thought \"what you see (from the front door) is what you get\".   We stopped in last night after my sister's graduation and heading to dinner. There was a decent crowd of us.. my sister, bobby, a few other graduates, her friend who was celebrating her 21st birthday and about 6 other people. Since I live in south side, i had a feeling most bars would be dead on a tuesday night. Mario's was our second stop and there was a nice little crowd in there for it being tuesday! I love how there is a little upstairs \"loft\" area. We hung out there most of the night. On the other side of the buidling, there is a whole different bar, another loft area that needs to ANOTHER bar! Holy cow. I never even knew. (of course 2nd bar upstairs was closed since it was a weekday)  There was some karaoke going on. Since there was a fun crowd, karaoke was actually interesting & fun, especially when the entire bar full of slightly tipsy people were helping the guy sing \"thinking out loud\", lol.   I had to work the next morning so we kept the drinks minimum. I only ordered a captain & coke but it was deff super strong and well appreciated.   4 stars for a cool, chill environment and strong drinks!"}
{"text":"If you want to see what heaven is like, go to Mario's.   There is honestly no need for any other bar on the Sahhhside. Karaoke night, live music, $3 32oz gobs, always $2.50 Yuengling bottles, $.39 wing night, shot wheels, a dozen or so TVs, extremely friendly bartenders, Will down in the men's room, the frequent Kung Fu Joe visit. The ONLY problem is their Duquesne stained glass window is covered up by an old occupancy sign.... let's see some more Dukes love!!!!!  Also, new food menu. Not your typical bar food.... it's an amazing menu in terms of selection and food quality. Build your own mac n' cheese. Enough said.  And JimKim."}
{"text":"Mario's is by far my favorite happy hour spot in South Side. You can't beat half price drinks and $3.95 appetizers, which is their happy hour special. I have never left there with a bill higher than $20 for 2 people... which for my boyfriend and I can include but not limited to miller lite ($1.75 each), hoegaarden ($2.50 each), double captain and coke ($5.00), large chicken nachos ($4.95), spinach dip with pita bread ($3.95... this by far is the best spinach dip I've ever had), as well as wings, mini hot dogs, pierogies, etc.... Such a great deal.   Now I will admit that I rarely go to Mario's UNLESS it's happy hour, so my opinion I suppose is fairly biased considering happy hour crowds are generally more laid back and reserved and it's not as packed as I've seen it late night on weekends. But I must say, I love this place. I love the atmosphere, the staff, the food, the drinks... and as long as I work one block up, this is where you'll find me at least once a week from 5-7."}
{"text":"Customer service SUCKS!  FOOD SUCKS! I ordered nachos. Simple. They were chunked together with some type if cheese!  Makes it impossible to eat neat! This place sucks if you're an adult. Please ask me to send my bad experience video! Please!"}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan of Mario's! Last year I was quite the regular. I knew all the bartenders and would come for every Pens game or football game. One main reason I would frequent so often was because it was my hangout where everyone knows your name and I wanted to catch the Hockey players when they were out. OK I was a little star struck but it wears off!  This bar was voted best college bar and sports bar of 2010 so I think that says a lot. Last year I was in party mode and if you are into that scene here is where the meat market takes place. Jocks and those chasing jocks from neighboring colleges pretty much live here. It is a busy bar almost any night of the week so if you want to be immersed in a crowd and you have someone visiting from out of town bring them here instead of some dead dive bar.  I believe that Mario Lemieux owns this bar so it is decorated in player Jerseys and sports memorabilia. The space is big so you will always have a view of the game no matter where you are. TVs are all over. I prefer to sit at the bar but if you want to do that, get there a little earlier, very early if you are planning for playoffs. They have tots! I love tater tots and they've got em' yumm. They also have many more apps and bar food. I don't consider it to be fine dining it's comfort food that tastes good with beers. Goblet night, $2 beers during game time, trivia, random goof off night, tasty shooters(blue sweet tarts)...those are the things that make Mario's shine. I have to get my game face on because Mario's it's ON!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times... One of my favorite bars on Carson st. It gets crowded on the weekends! Huge bar with plenty of levels. Food always looks and smells good but I am yet to try it. Good deals on drinks, not too expensive of a bar. Reasonable prices and attentive service make Marion's a great place to start the night on the town.   I do not like how the floors get sticky and aren't regularly kept squeaky clean.  Waiters and bar tenders are pretty attentive and helpful, no complaints on service.   Mario's is a solid 3.5 star bar. I rounded up here."}
{"text":"Went in to celebrate nieces 21st birthday and have a couple drinks. Place was busy for a Sunday night filled with young college students. It was entertaining to watch the drunk kids flirting among each other. Service was ok once they acknowledged you. I had a beer which was fine but family members had mixed drinks. Glasses were not clean, poor drink quality but not sure what we should have expected from a place filled with college kids. Cleanliness was ok and the staff was friendly. Prices were a little on the high end especially with the poor drink quality. Do not plan to return and don't recommend."}
{"text":"One of the most overrated bars in the South Side, I rarely ever have a good time here.  It gets shoulder to shoulder on the weekend.  I mean to the point where you can't even move a few feet around you.  How is that fun??"}
{"text":"Used to here often when I lived here. A PGH landmark. Ignore the haters. Enjoy it for what it is and you will like it."}
{"text":"Tater Tots. Yes, this bar has tater tots on the menu. Need I say more?   As a note, I avoid this and most uber-crowded South Side bars after midnight on a Friday or Saturday. You're either there to be drunk or to be seen - not to get good service.  However, if you head to Mario's for happy hour, you'll get a good crowd, good prices on their decent draft selection and some tasty apps. Their insanity wings rival any other bar in the neighborhood (ahem... fatheads) for their level of spiciness. Their nachos can make a dinner for 2. If you stay after happy hour, the prices are still pretty reasonable and the bartenders are still pretty nice. It's a great place to watch a Pens game or a college basketball game.  Overall, it's a good weeknight bar with classic hardwood everywhere, nice bathrooms, and TATER TOTS."}
{"text":"I couldn't even have a good time here. Way too overcrowded, to the point that I had to stand in place and drink. Moving even slightly would cause me to bump someone else. What fun is that? I don't see the excitement in this place, nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is awful. It screams trash. The place is dirty, the service is awful. I would not recommend this to anyone. Go to Local across the street..."}
{"text":"I asked for my coat back, because the bartenders and waitresses told me in the beginning of the night that they would hold it. When I asked for it back, they told me they didn't have it and didn't know where it was for 5/10 minutes all of a sudden when I started asking more questions and spoke with the \"managers\" my Coat appeared. Moreover, they then proceeded to tell me I had to leave the \"bar\" and pushed me out!"}
{"text":"Classic Southside stop Flirt with attractive college Drunks while being crushed."}
{"text":"Fun bar for a younger crowd .. Not my cup of tea I'm laid back lounge gal.. Lol"}
{"text":"Went with a large group on Friday afternoon to watch NCAA basketball games. Sat in the balcony upstairs and had a great view of all 5 games on TV. Ordered the Yinzer-rogies, which were incredible. Great atmosphere for watching sports."}
{"text":"First experience at Mario's. The bouncer let me in with my real SC ID. Went to the bar and the bartender accused me of using a fake ID. (Granted it has some wear and tear). Handed it off to several employees. An oriental male by the name of Jim took my id, ran outside without my permission to the neighboring bar. I walked out and showed him 4 other cards/licenses with my name on it. (General contractors license, health insurance, debit card, dental.) Jim proceeded to pull out a pocket knife and threaten to cut my ID in half. He then told me to leave immediately. I asked for a manager he told me to come back tomorrow, I went inside and found a manager. At this point Jim walks up and tells his manager I came outside and tried to fight him..... the manager tells me to leave, and the entire staff tells me the ID is fake. I then walked across the street and had a Pittsburgh police office call and verify my DL #. The service was non existent (waited for 10 min before I approached the bar with no server - then the above incident happened) AWFUL STAFF - HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL - BAD SERVICE - WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Mario's, good food, love there Sunday brunch. GREAT deals for happy hour but overpriced otherwise. Service has not been the greatest the last couple times I've been there and I have just been going there forever. For sure a must go too!"}
{"text":"This place was overcrowded, overhyped, and overrated. It was just a bunch of racist people in their own clicks, drinking and playing shitty ass music. The whole place smells like old man cigar smoke, fish, and feet. They don't even dance at this place. It's just a typical, lame racist college bar. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner for the first time after years of hearing about it. We decided on sharing appetizers.  We had the pork sliders, perogies, and mozz sticks. The mozz sticks were burnt slightly, but still okay. The pork sliders were great. Tons of pork, awesome slaw, and a crunchy pickle. The perogies were the highlight. Perfectly sautéed and slightly crisp. Plenty of caramelized onions, and sour cream. Sub par beer selection, but overall, I'd be back."}
{"text":"Good old Mario's. This place is known to everyone who frequents the southside. I've never been here for the food so I can't really comment on that. But I can say that I never really can see this place serving food. The building it's self is two big rooms. There is a upstairs seating area as well to hang out or just look down at people. The prices are what you would expect for southside. There's not really any great specials on drinks. There's not really any entertainment here as far as pool or darts goes. It gets crowded fast on the weekends even with being such a big area. There is a shot wheel for the daring to risk what they will get. The dj usually plays bangers to get the crowd hyped up but also hits you with the unexpected. The bathrooms here suck and are usually dirty and going down the steps is extremely cramped to the basement. The staff are friendly from experiences I've had here in the past. Overall if I'm in the southside I don't go out of my way to come here but I'll likely return with friends."}
{"text":"Came for lunch the other day....food was good, but service was pathetic. Server/bartender was much more interested in chatting with his friends than providing service, we were the only people at a table, and we had to either stand up and walk to the bar or wave our arms to get any attention, too many other bars and restaurants on Carson to put up with this again,"}
{"text":"Perhaps I hated Mario's because I am older than 22 or perhaps it is because I felt like a pin ball being shoved between dude after dude.  It also could have been the Philly in me not being able to relax in a bar that has large stained glass windows dedicated to Pittsburgh Sports (I felt like I was behind enemy lines).    Either way, the cheap beer was not enough to woo me into liking Mario's.  The music was too random to be ironic.  I am not good at math, but I do know that the ratio here of dudes to girls = sausage fest.  We had one beer here and it took all my might to not throw some 'bows."}
{"text":"What you'd expect out of a bar on Carson. Decent food and a good selection of brews. Service was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks after being on the road for a good 6 hours and had a nice time. They were playing 90's music when we first walked in (nice!), then that switched to top 40 on the speakers later on. Crowd was fairly young (20's-30's) and the place was lively on a Monday night. Quick bartenders, nice beer selection.  But they really need to re-think the bathroom attendant situation. The men's bathroom has no attendant, but the women's has not one, but TWO. To quote Amy Schumer, no one is ever like, \"Ooooh good, a bathroom attendant!\". But these were particularly off putting. I didn't know they were attendants right away. They were sitting talking together, listening to their own music, not wearing any uniforms (not that any of these things are the real issue). I went to wash my hands and discovered there was no soap, when suddenly one swooped in with some, and before I was even done washing my hands said, \"And just a reminder ma'am we do work for tips so anything you give would be greatly appreciated\". I've have never been ASKED for a tip before in my life. Not cool. Especially when someone has removed the products I could have used myself so I'm forced to accept theirs. The second time I came in they didn't even remember me but told me how gorgeous and fabulous I was before giving me the same line. We cut the night short after that, it was a really weird, awkward situation."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why this place is only 3 1/2 . We stopped in for lunch,  both ordered burgers with tater tots. Food was great, atmosphere nice & service decent. $20 for 2 ppl. Doesn't get much better and I can't wait to come back and try more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"In from out of town, we needed a spot to hang. A local recommended this place. Great call! They have a shot wheel that we took too much of an advantage of. Great hang out spot with a decent beer selection. The bartenders were a little fed up with us which I don't understand because we had 3-4 girls with us.   Oh well, I'd go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Mario's is better on weeknights. It gets waaaaay too packed on the weekends. Monday nights they have live music. It usually sucks!"}
{"text":"It's your standard sports bar but everything I had was good each time I went.  All the servers were pretty friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Looking to spin the wheel? Count me in! But I'll pass on the food next time. I had the veggie burger, it wasn't very warm at all when it came out. It tasted pretty bland and I'm not exactly sure what it was made out of, the bun was good! The tots and fries were good, but you would have to try pretty hard to mess those up. I feel like the food used to be good, but not this time. The others I was with agreed the food was just okay... maybe we needed to drink more? I'm not really sure what...   It actually kind of smells like poop today, gross. How do people come to work here?"}
{"text":"Decent food and good drink specials. We were in from Chicago during Stanley Cup finals and the staff was awesome in providing us a place to catch the game!"}
{"text":"As many timed as I've been to Marios I don't think I've ever tasted the food. If you are in town and you like beer in large quantities stop by and drink a 'yard' otherwise this is just another Southside bar. If you are getting a yard you will have to put down a credit card for security deposit on the glass (be careful the glasses are expensive)!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's Most Popular Bar. My first time to Pittsburgh I didn't know where the place to be was, This is the place to be! The place gets wild on Friday and Saturdays after 10pm. They usually have a line but it moves fast. This bar is multiple floors and it is a blast!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, always a good crowd. You can catch some of Pittsburgh's athletes here as well as out of town players. It's a good time."}
{"text":"Went on the Fourth of July for drinks. The place had a good vibe and we took advantage of the shots wheel. The security were very nice to us at closing time, and the drinks were well priced. I'll definitely be coming back here my next time in Pittsburgh :) the girls bathrooms were horrible, but that's hard to avoid, and the security guys were very cool about us using the guys bathrooms before close haha."}
{"text":"I went here to watch a Steelers game.  That was a poor decision.  The food was fried to a crisp, tasted awful, and was overpriced.  To top it off, our service was slow - we were dying to get out of there and couldn't find a waitress.  The layout is awkward so it was impossible to get a good view of a TV.  We stayed long enough to finish our meals and pay, and then we left for The Bar - a place that can be proud to call itself a sports bar.  I won't be back to Mario's!"}
