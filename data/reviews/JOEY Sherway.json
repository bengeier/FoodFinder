{"text":"What a waste of time and money !!!! Just finished \"birthday\" dinner. Had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. And still waiting for a birthday cake....even asking 2 times....don't go here...."}
{"text":"I like this place, the staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. The food is exceptional, it might be slightly overpriced but it makes up for the ambiance and the customer service."}
{"text":"Really loved the chicken and beet salad - yummy uncomplicated dressing, moist chicken, fresh and delicious.    Loud hip atmosphere.  Great service.    Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to the Sherway location and I must say it was by far the best service I've had at Joey before!   I was there for lunch with my cousin to plan out her baby shower. Our waitress Tina was very patient and friendly with us. We spent about 2 hours there planning and Tina was kind enough to check up on us every so often.   The tandoori chicken flatbread is my all time favourite here. We also tried the chili chicken and one of the salads which were okay.   At the end of our lunch our waitress surprised us with a free dessert! We had the apple crumble and it was very good. Would recommend it to others!   I will definitely be coming back to this location next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went for drinks after work with some friends and it was packed. We kindly asked the front staff for a table for a party of 12 in the bar area and were seated within 2minutes. We all were well taken care of with excellent service not to add we had plenty of amazing waitresses constantly keeping tabs on us making sure our glasses were always full of fluids..   Appetizers were amazing a bit on the pricy side but we'll worth it for the amazing atmosphere and fantastic eye candy. We do eat with our eyes... Ladies and gentlemen.   I can't complain this is our first experience and I would gladly return for some amazing drinks and finely tuned appetizers."}
{"text":"Sub standard food and service with an above average price. Wait staff dress code not appropriate for young families. Stop with the black tight dresses and focus on food and service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my mom, cousin, and aunt.  The atmosphere was great!  We were seated quickly even though it was family day weekend. Our server was great as well.  We were introduced to the \"appy\" hour menu, and I have to say it was DELICIOUS! My mother, who does not like raw fish, really enjoyed the ahi tacos!!   I would visit again, and probably take both my mom and dad there for the appy hour!"}
{"text":"After having a less then agreeable first experience at Joey (we waited 1 hr and 10 mins after being told it was a 30 min wait), the first time, my girlfriend and I decided to give Joey another try and bring the kids after seeing Santa. We were told that they offered  a kids menu, however the options were not listed on the menu. The waiter gave is a list of choices and we ordered for the kids.  My kids ordered a juice, pasta with tomato sauce and an ice cream for dessert. The pasta dish was on the small side, and so I had to order another for my older son.  I was in complete disbelief when I saw the bill. $4.50 for an apple juice, $9 for kids pasta and $6 for an ice cream. My child's meal was almost $35. With alcohol, my meal cost less!  My entire bill was $93 for two kids under the age of 8 and myself (I had a salmon bowl and a beer). Completely outrageous and misleading. If you are going to charge extortionist prices for kids, have the decency to put it on the menu!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now - great atmosphere, modest uniforms for the staff, great food options. I had the Steak and Sushi, a delightful combination, a chocolate lava cake on a recent visit, and I really enjoyed them. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I've  been here many times and have to say that the staff that I have come in contact with each time are amazing. Have not been to any other restaurants where customer service is this good. Keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Frequented this location for dinner several times and been very happy with the experience. Overall, the quality of food is excellent especially when you consider how reasonably priced all the dishes are.   My absolute favourite is the Ahi Tuna Salad - seared rare tuna topped with greens, crispy noodles and avocado in a slightly sweet ginger cilantro dressing. It's so delicious and definitely worth trying! It's been hard for me to avoid choosing this dish every single time so I haven't yet ventured further into their menu however as an app I do love their sushi cones. I've also tried their Penang Prawn curry and loved it however it's a bit heavy for me. My husband usually goes for their sliders, steak and burger and even though he can be a bit picky at times, he seems to be genuinely happy with his selection every time. The food is always consistently prepared and presented.  As far as drinks go, I'm partial to their super sonic gin & tonic which is well made. They have drink & app specials from Sunday to Thursday from 3-6 pm and 9pm-close where a limited selection of drinks are half off. And yes my g&t is included in that which is great! I also like their non-alcoholic grapefruit elderflower soda. My favourite dessert here is the individually baked apple pie with vanilla ice-cream. It's so good! Please try it if you are a pie junkie like me :D  It's always been busy whenever we've gone so our second or third drink orders can sometimes get a tiny bit delayed but that's understandable. We've never managed a reservation since our plans are always last minute but at the most we've had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table. It's worth noting that once we were seated very close to the main entrance and it was quite chilly. Since then we've tried to get seating in the lounge area which has been more comfortable.   The hosts and servers are all genuinely friendly and accommodating, which just adds to the experience. It's one of our favourite restaurants because of the atmosphere, consistently good quality food and great value for a guilt-free night out that doesn't break the bank!"}
{"text":"good food, good service, good atmosphere....what else you want?  we sampled a lot of the options (burger, wings, pasta, calamari....dessert), and we liked them all. can't wait to go again.....oh,  it's kind of expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"We live in the area and frequently eat out. We have heard great reviews, so tried to show up once only to find that there was an hour long wait (Thursday evening) and decided to make a reservation for a late lunch on a Saturday instead.  When we rang to make the reservation they said that it wasn't that busy and we shouldn't expect a wait, but we chose to reserve for 3pm (an hour later). When we arrived, it was quite busy, but no lines. They asked if there were any minors dining w/ us when we made the booking and must have made note somewhere.  When we arrived, we were promptly seated. We had seen that they had vegetarian selection and knew of a vegetarian to enjoy their meal. We didn't know that we had to request a separate menu, but made that assumption when there were few options listed on the main menu and went to ask for the vegetarian menu. They gave us one to share between us (a table of 5).  First person came 'round to take our drink orders and let us know that our server would be over shortly to take our orders. We ordered 6 drinks (including 2 ice waters). We received 3 correctly, then one luke warm water (no ice), one iced tea (instead of water) and a partway through that mess, another gentleman came by w/ a caesar salad in place of the alcoholic caesar ordered from the drinks menu.   We asked the person who took our drink orders if they had a kids menu and they said \"no, but we can make kids portions of the regular menu items.  When it came time to order, we ordered a vegetarian burger from the vegetarian/gluten free menu (as it's different to the one listed on the main menu), a butter \"chicken\" soy meal from the vegetarian/gluten free menu, as well as a kids portion for the youngest and 3 items from the sharing/appetizer menu (2 vegetarian, one chicken w/o oyster sauce due to an allergy which was an option listed on the vegetarian menu, so should have been an easy swap out). We were hyper conscious of stressing the vegetarian needs as the waitress continued to say \"chicken\" in place of \"soy\" and the allergy, as we understood that the vegetarian menu was the only place that the \"oyster sauce\" free version was listed and we had ordered meaty item without the oyster sauce. So much so, that I offered to write the details down because I wasn't sure they \"HEARD\" the food needs, especially with a life threatening allergy. The waitress declined and read out our order which was accurate.   She returned to the table to let us know that they would not make a kids portion of the butter soy \"chicken\" and that we could have our typical choices of pasta, pizza, salad, actual chicken nuggets, salad and fries. We settled on a kids pasta w/ alfredo sauce and asked for cheese which we were informed already came on the pasta. We asked if we could order her garlic bread or something to accompany a pasta and she said they don't do that sort of thing.  Before the meals arrived, our oldest daughter said \"it better not come out w/ meat because I am starving and I don't trust that the order was taken properly\", so as soon as the food began to arrive, I snagged a piece of her \"soy\" to check it and it was chicken. A manager and wait staff were already rushing back to the order desk near the kitchen to double check it. I followed. If that wasn't accurate, we needed to be certain the oyster sauce free dish was really done correctly. They assured me they were on it and I returned to my seat. Seconds later, the manager came over to apologize and lifted the dishes off the table to have them remade as she said she'd rather not take the risk (thankfully), apologizing all the while. We were pretty hungry and stressed at that point, so fought the urge to make a big deal about the lack of cheese on the pasta dish and anyone that had a meal began eating.  After the food left for replacement, another manager came over to check on us and we explained that there were a number of issues w/ our orders, but that someone else was already taking care of it. She apologized and offered us a round of desserts for the trouble and said she would communicate that with the other manager who would later return w/ our freshly made new meals.  When the meals arrived, most of the other food was finished and they did come around later to take an order of 5 desserts which we were not billed for.  To be completely fair, the food was good. We all enjoyed it when it finally did arrive. The space is nice. I don't think it's meant to be a family restaurant, otherwise they'd have had proper kids menu. Food portions were good. Sharers/Appetizers could be a bit bigger, but they are tasty and fairly priced. Staff were pleasant enough (we had dealings with FIVE of them!), apologetic and quick to remedy the issues.   That said, the meal experience was a total bust. We enjoy going out for the experience as much as we do the food. This experience was subpar and we probably won't choose to spend our money at Joey's in the future.   Sure hope things get better."}
{"text":"Great upscale place and wonderful food and outstanding beautiful servers that are so pleasant.  I took away one star just because when I asked for sprinkle of Parmesan the told me you have to pay extra.  Really!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Spanish payella, tandoori chicken flatbread and calamari was great"}
{"text":"Coming to this Joey location was quite the experience! After visiting the Don Mills location, I was quite excited to visit this new venue at a mall I visit quite frequently (Sherway). I have to say, I was very impressed with the layout and the hospitality I received while dining here, especially within their opening peak.  Upon entry, the hostesses were not only extremely polite and accommodating, but they also provided my boyfriend and I small appetizers and a menu to keep us occupied since they were certainly a full house (especially in the lounge, where we requested to be seated).   Once seated, our server by the name (I believe) of Austa was quick and completely attentive, taking our drink orders immediately and attending to our every request promptly. I have to add that she was extremely entertaining and humorous as well! It's great knowing that this new establishment has taken the time to hire great quality servers such as this individual. My experience here was definitely heightened with the service delivered by this young lady!   I hope the pictures provided do justice for the delicious fare they serve here! It's a fusion of Asian and American, which was quite tantalizing! The presentation of everything was seriously impressive as well. The Caesar salad was just what you would expect anywhere, nothing exceptional but definitely lived up to its name, but everything else was outstanding!  I will be returning to this location, absolutely, and I hope I can request this server when I return."}
{"text":"Hand-pressed burger was top-notch. (Super messy, because it's loaded to the brim, so would not recommend on first date, lol.)   Upstairs patio was lovely in the late evening and a great atmosphere overall. Our server (Shante) was funny, sweet and attentive (without being overbearing!)  If you make a reservation, you don't have to wait (duh.)"}
{"text":"Tried calling to book a table (though not very necessary) but kept getting their machine. Was however able to easily book a table online.  I did also get a follow-up call for my reservation which was impressive.  Our server was great and definitely more attentive than those who would walk by.  Asked another server for ketchup which I never got.  Though our server was mostly attentive, the bills were mixed up, for the most part.  Wasn't as big a deal since I was with my close friends, but there were just 4 of us so the glitch could've been easily avoided.  I can understand if it were a much larger party.  Otherwise, the service was very good.  Hawaiian Tuna Tacos - I'm such a sucker for ahi tuna tacos so I had to have it.  Though the tuna was kind of fresh, it lacked flavour.  Perhaps it needed some kind of sauce or perhaps the tuna needed a little bit of a marinade.  I'd probably order it again though. 4/5.   Yellowfin Tuna Salad - Minus the cilantro, I would probably order this next time (was a friend who ordered it). Was a generous serving and the dressing was very refreshing.  Also loved the crunch from the noodles.  5/5.   Ahi Tuna Club - Was incredibly flavourful and the serving was actually pretty generous.  One thing I do wish was the tuna steak having a little bit of a thicker cut.  Because the steak was cut at less than half an inch, it was overcooked.  The times I've had an ahi tuna club sandwich or burger, the thick was much thicker and was lightly seared leaving most of it raw.  The ratio this time around though was the complete opposite.  However, the toppings were delicious.  I could do without the onion rings in the actual sandwich and would have rather have that on the side, however It was accompanied by some shoestring fries that were perfectly crisp.  I did pick out the rings and ate that first. A little bit on the greasy side but it was really good.  Overall, it was a really good dish and I thought it met its price point. 5/5.   Ravioli With Lobster Cream & Grilled Prawns - One of the most delicious cream sauces I've ever tasted at a restaurant.  Was a little on the rich side but it was so tasty!  It was a friend who ordered so I didn't want to take any of their shrimps as there weren't very many.  So it's not exactly your typical portion of pasta.  This is definitely something I'd order for myself in the future. 5/5.   Apple Pie - One of my girlfriends kept raving about the apple pie.  She literally would not shut up about the pie the entire night.  I've been friends with her for over 20 years and never have I seen her so excited for a dish, so of course she had to order it.  I did have a bite of it and I can see why she wouldn't shut up about it.  Pies are individually baked and was of course  served with ice cream (her choice was vanilla versus maple).  Was perfectly balanced as the pie itself already had some maple on it.  Definitely a must-try if you have a sweet tooth. 5/5.  Molten Chocolate Cake - Was also very delicious and not overly rich.  If you love chocolate and chocolate cake, it's also a must-try.  The raspberries were also a nice touch and added great flavour. 5/5."}
{"text":"Love it here! Food was amazing with a lot of Asian influences. We got 2 orders of Calamari Fritti (a lil pricy but we love it! it came with 3 battered asparagus and it was a nice touch) Hawaiian Tuna Tacos(tiny but tasty) Steak & Sushi (Steak sauce was on the saltier side), truffle yam fries ($5 on happy hour!).  The servers are also personable and they are dressed in decent uniforms unlike other restos like this (yes i think you know other place im talking about with servers in black ultra mini skirts lol).  One downside is the washroom; it's upstairs. If you are feeling tipsy, it would be a trek to go up...  Overall we had a good experience and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner this evening for the grand opening. My party was given a booth by the bar with the open concept kitchen behind us which was cool! Caesars are good here, however served in a short rather than tall glass. Ordered calamari, bacon cheesebuger, sweet potato fries, California Chicken Sandwich. All were good, especially the chicken sandwich. They charge for chipotle mayo which usually comes with sweet potato fries instead of their regular mayo. Guess not here. Waitress also shorted me $5 when paying and brought it to my attention last minute as we were leaving. Weird. Will return again in the Summer when they open the rooftop patio. 3/5"}
{"text":"Great calamari. Came here when they first opened and they had a few kinks to work out but overall the place looks gorgeous and it was pretty busy. I enjoyed it and hope to come back again in a couple months when they have everthing running smoothly."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant on a Monday at 6:30 pm. Service was good and efficient and the food was very good. I had the steak and frites. Had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table and they weren't very busy at the time. Overall a very good experience. I'll go there again"}
{"text":"So you love good food! (check)..good ambiance (check)...eye candies...(lol)- (check)...you will love this place!! I had to wait 30 minutes + to get seated on the top floor....that too on a Thursday evening (no weekend my friends)..but it was a game night..I understand!!  Staff is amazing! They are attentive..despite of a house full...full marks here!!   We ordered hot wings (yum)...Korean fried cauliflower ( I swear, will never try it again)...Calamari fritters (other said it was great- since I don't eat it)...Virgin Mojito (good for me)...Superfood 500 (beacuse I love salads...and it was very good!!)  Fellow companions on the table..also loved whatever they ordered...Herb Crush Salmon! Chicken & Steak,Wine and beverage...see people...can't remember all order from a table of 5 ....moral of the story is....its a 4 star from my side!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Joey's twice so far, most recently for my brother's birthday last week. Not only was the service very attentive (the night manager and servers we had were awesome) but the food was delicious. Must have's are the Japanese Gyoza and the Lettuce Wraps for starters. You will think you've died and gone to heaven when you try their Molten Lava Chocolate Souffle. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoy my Sunday lunch here with the girlfriend. Sherway Mall is challenging to find parking on the weekends.  First the environment reminds me a scene out of a movie. The energy was great, the staff all looked amazing and the smell of the restaurant was delightful. We were greeted immediately and there was no wait for a table. We requested a booth.  This place is great for families and accommodating large parties. We were served by a young gentleman. Advised us about the specials  of the day. We ordered the lettuce wraps and the Miso Ramen Noodle Soup. If you have been following any of my previous reviews, you know I'm a huge ramen noodle fan. Let me tell you, to find a great ramen noodle bowl of soup in Mississauga that is delicious is RARE. Seasoned well and was absolutely delicious. I loved every bite of it.   For the Lettuce Wrap order, my girlfriend asked specifically no cilantro. Unfortunately the order came with cilantro, it was disappointing. We waited another 10 mins for an appetizer. At this point we were already eating our mains. The manager came out and apologized on behalf of the server, the server took full ownership of his error and apologized as well. It was great seeing accountability in their customer service. No monetary compensation or discount was provided for their error. As to the flavour of the lettuce wrap, we found it was overwhelming with their sauce and not enough meat, but still was delicious and the crispy noodles were perfect.  Our server was professional but seemed a bit new to serving, he repeated 3 times in different moments about the deserts how their ice cream is made in hour and is fresh within 24 hours.   Overall, the environment is great, food was delicious, service is good. New restaurant to Mississauga, their on the right path but their are always room for improvements"}
{"text":"Great food and decor, but horrible service. Washrooms are up three flights of stairs."}
{"text":"Really great albeit expensive fillet mignon, cooked perfectly rare with a translucent purple interior and not a drop of blood"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend and really liked our food. We got the Korean fried cauliflower, which was surprisingly really yummy (tasted like chicken). We also got the lobster grilled cheese as well as the hand pressed burger. Both were really well done! Wasn't a fan of the fries it came with; it tasted like those store bought frozen McCain fries. The service and atmosphere was really good. A great place to go watch a game, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Joey's locations across the country and my favourite still has to be on the West Coast.  Popped in here for dinner prior to going to the movies, it was me and 3 girls. We were seated in a timely manner as we had made reservations in advance as it was a Saturday.  I had taco's for dinner and they were over cooked, soft taco's should be sitting around for the sauce to seep through and make the shell soggy.  Service was okay, there were two specific times we were looking for the server, once to get a top up on water and a second to get cutlery.  With Sherway having so many great restaurant options, this place is not on the top of my return list."}
{"text":"Had lunch there last week and sat at the bar with a friend. The place got busy very quickly as there were many groups there having their company Christmas lunches.   Lots of beers on tap and being seated at the bar, I saw lots of different types of drinks being made and the bartenders and waitresses were kept busy. Even thought it was busy, the staff were quick and efficient getting the drinks and food out.   The restaurant is like many of the downtown Toronto bar/restaurants that serves good food and drinks. The place looks higher end than the regular chain restaurant and likely caters to a business crowd seeking a bar scene after work. Lunch, 2 beers and a coffee came to $40 each person, before tip.   I will definitely return in the summer to check out their upstairs patio and the good looking waitresses."}
{"text":"Went there for late lunch with family. Interesting modern decor, but they sure need to get their act together. Service is really bad. Server was late, We ordered to two different people, drinks were really late (how long does it take to pour two glasses of wine?) and it took a while to take our order for food.   Eventually, they messed up our order and brought the wrong items, and they didn't even apologize or compensate us about it. If they can't get their act together at 4pm, I can't imagine how bad it is during rush hour..."}
{"text":"I came here late at night with my momma dukes and their attention was brought fast to us but also careless at the same time because they seated us at a very dirty dining area although we were seated fairly quickly.. At least clean up.  There were straws and bits of food I was stepping on..it was really gross but I tried to not let it bother me.  While we were deciding what to get on the menu...we were served a couple of glasses of water ....a bit of time goes by and we're just about ready to order, our server came and I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad and it was super delicious! Crispy noodles, cilantro sauce , a little too much dressing but nonetheless was good, the tuna was amazing! It all tasted fresh!! I literally devoured it in 5 minutes! It was plated a little messy but tasted quality fresh so it's all good!...   BUT as the night went on after the salad, it was downhill from there...my mom ordered the Steak and Mushroom Jus and I ordered Ravioli with Lobster Cream and Grilled Prawns. It took literally an hour to come out!!!! Our server was trying to distract us with conversation but we were very upset, we wanted our food. I turned around and I can see the kitchen staff walking around carelessly. Apparently they overcooked the steak either way we lost our appetites. When the dish had come out, it didn't taste all that great, the lobster cream was super thick and full of oil, the prawns were decent but its the sauce that  killed it because I got sick of eating it with all the thick cream. My mom barely touched her food. We were both very upset, no matter what the time, the business should be running as it would be during the day. Management should watch the kitchen staff and quit slacking. It will disappoint many trying to have a good night out.  Mind you, I've been to Joeys during the day and it was excellent service AND food! Everything came out on time and tasted delicious but maybe at night, the service isn't the same. I would think if you're open that late, that you're energy is strong and focus is enough to run through the hours of the day , I guess not ..maybe the workers arent being fed or whatever it is but I was disappointed during that night."}
{"text":"Even though their food is nicely presented, and atmosphere upscale, Joey's service is terrible.  It is obvious that they hire for a \"look\" and not getting customers served in a timely manner.   Most of our meal came out cold and we rarely saw the girl that took our order.  Unfortunate because the flavors of the food were quite good."}
{"text":"Came for my actual bday with the bf because we happened to be shopping here. I didn't even realize they had a Joey's at Sherway, so I was pleasantly surprised. I do enjoy the other locations (yorkdale and shops at don mills). I felt this one was consistent.  Food:  Hot wings - The presentation was fine, but it would have looked more appetizing had it been on a slightly smaller plate. Chicken wings themselves were juicy and tender. Marinated with franks red hot. Came with blue cheese dressing. My personal preference would be for ranch or dill. I will ask them if these are options next time. I also wish it came with some carrot and or celery sticks. Server brought us a bowl of hot water and there expanding wet naps which I thought was cool.   Filet mignon - Came with crispy mash potatoes and veggies. I always thought these \"crispy mash potatoes\" were a bit strange. I'd be happy with just regular mash potatoes instead of these \"fancier\" ones. Not comparable to going to an actual steakhouse, but the dish was still good over all.   Yellowfin tuna salad - Consistent with the other locations. I love this salad. The dressing is so simple. The salad is well balanced with the perfect portion of veggies, tuna, nuts and dressing. I don't think I could get tired of having this salad.   3x Sangria - It was good, but not as good as having it during happy hour ($4.00 at happy hour, $9.00 all other times ). I also noticed that they put more fruit at the other locations (unless they stopped doing this too). The sangria at this joeys only had an orange slice and no other fruit.   1x Henderson's best - First time trying this beer. I really enjoy amber ales over all other types, so enjoyed this one thoroughly.   2x corona - The lime wedge in the second corona was too fat and was a struggle to put into the beer bottle.   Service: 20 minute wait for a dinner table, we had no reservations as I don't ever plan anything for my actual bday (normally lands on a weekday). They took my phone number and told me they will text me when the table is ready.   We decided to have some drinks at the bar while we waited. Luckily there were exactly 2 seats left.  As we ordered some drinks, we told the bartender we were waiting for seating elsewhere. He was nice enough to give us the dinner menus to look at so we can decide what to eat while we had some drinks at the bar. He also let us know that we can settle the bill as soon as our table was ready (making a smooth transition).   As we were seated at our table, we noticed it was slightly small.. Maybe I felt this way since two ppl just vacated a large booth right across from us. I felt bad for asking since our server had just seated us, but she checked with the front counter to make sure we can move and they let us without any issues. Moving seats did mean we had a new server though.. too bad because she was super sweet.   Our next server did take some time to come around, but it was fine because the first girl already took our drink order. We also had some time to appreciate the brickwork and large art piece hanging in front of us.   Once he finally came, the whole service went smoothly. He was a bit chatty, but I can't knock a server for being in a good mood or for actually doing their job well. My preference is to have a little more privacy, but I'm sure other ppl really enjoy this type of service.   Everything came out quick enough and he made sure we always had drinks. He even brought out an extra round of drinks when we actually declined, but I don't blame him because it was really loud in there. I genuinely think he just misheard us. We also didn't bother correcting him or sending them back, so yolo.   Final thoughts: I enjoy joeys over most other likewise chain restaurants. I would come back to this joeys if I happen to be in the area. The wait was not too long, food was all consistently good (with other locations) and the service was exceptional.   Note to self: Stop snap chatting and take regular photos. Took some quality snapchats, but yelp won't let me upload."}
{"text":"Came in here for a few drinks on a Tuesday, we were only drinking vodka sodas, so I can't leave the most comprehensive review, but just wanted to say that Sam: you were great.  Dear Joey's,  Sam is great!"}
{"text":"Just had the Yellowfin Tuna Salad ($19.50) and it was absolutely dynamite!  My wife wanted to try something different and what a great choice suggested by their server. Just as they said on their menu: Seared rare, mango, peanuts, avocado, crispy noodles, cilantro ginger dressing. Fantastic combination!  We will definitely order this the next time around!"}
{"text":"I find this location much slower to serve and waiters/waitresses less attentive than the Markville location.  Been here twice now, both times no spoon with my soup and have to flag someone down before the soup gets cold...  No decaf at 8:40 pm- it's 8:40 pm- you gotta know you're gonna get decaf orders- \"ran out\" okay guess I'm going to Tim's.  Waiting for my lava cake- going on 15 minutes now- have one spoon and two people- hmmmm.  17 minutes and counting for the bill- going to the Keg next time."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. A little overzealous at times, but someone was always ready to help and serve us when we needed it"}
{"text":"I've been to the Joey at Yorkdale and Eaton Centre and I think after visiting the Sherway Garden location for the first time last night that it is my new favourite location. We got there around 9:30pm on a Friday and it was very busy, I wasn't expecting the volume. The hostess informed us that the wait could be an hour to an hour and a half and we were okay with that. I wasn't starving, we really just wanted to get some drinks and catch up. We waited outside of the restaurant for about 30 - 35 minutes and then saw an opening around the bar so we grabbed it. Soon after sitting there we were sent a text that our reservation was ready.   I got the Pesto Shrimp Flatbread (my favourite appetizer) and a 9 oz glass of the Bodega Malbec. Amazing pairing if I do say so myself. The waitresses were very attentive, got us everything we needed and our food arrived quickly. For the amount of people in the restaurant it wasn't extremely loud, I didn't have to yell at the person beside me. The music was awesome too.   I even got a chance to check out the awesome patio upstairs which was a nice touch for this location. I will definitely be visiting this location more often."}
{"text":"One of my go to restaurants! Joey Sherway is an amazing restaurant whether it's a date or just grabbing a bite and a drink with friends! The staff are always kind and courteous, with managers like Cody and Jess (the ones I've met) I can see why the staff are so great! Definitely go if you haven't been and if you have go again"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 10 to celebrate a birthday. Very underwhelming food and drinks. Service was good however and they appreciated our comments.   This was my first time at a Joey restaurant and if it's indicative of the chain I certainly won't go back.   Drinks - I ordered a Mojito, which it turns out they have no idea how to prepare. They simply added rum to soda water and thew in the mint. They obviously don't know to muddle mint/sugar/lime. A restaurant of this size should hire bar staff that knows how to make cocktails. My friend had the 'special' blueberry mojito and it was the same lack of preparation, as they just threw in a few crushed blueberries. I sent mine back. The replacement Caesar was much better although for a double was kinda weak.  I ordered the salmon entree. The salmon was well prepared and tasted okay but the side Crispy Mashed Potatoes disappointed. It was about 2 oz's of potato puree with a side of grilled veggies. It came with a spring roll? on top of the mash. When I finished the measly portion of potato puree I cut open the spring roll...which turns out was more potato puree in a Phyllo wrap. This was what they considered crispy which was anything but. A soggy potato puree wrap contained another 2oz's puree. Who the frig came up with this lame idea?   My wife ordered the Butter Chicken which is false advertising to say the least. What came was a bowl of vegetable medley. It was definitely the same mix of vegetables that they grill and serve as a side dish. So this bowl of veggies sat in the \"Butter Chicken\" where nay a piece of chicken could be found at first. At best we think it came with 2oz of chicken in the entree. Another friend had ordered the same and it was a repeat of veggie medley with hints of chicken, in a butter chicken sauce. Also, the menu said it comes with Naan but what came was Papadum.   Other friends ordered the Fish Tacos which were a hit, as was the Tuna Tartar salad. Seems like this place does a decent burger and fries and some salads.   Know going in that this is a chain restaurant and expect the same underwhelming experience that you would get at a Jack Astors. If you live in the suburbs this might be the start of a boring movie date that you want to fake a night or two with. This restaurant is just like those dates, where you fake it on the outside but deep down inside is hollow, empty and lacks any substance.   Joey's is a cafeteria with slick varnish and girls in tight dresses which may be fine if you're the dumb jock dating the cheerleader looking to get to third base tonight."}
{"text":"I wanted to hate this place, I really did. I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants - the fake servers, mediocre food and above-average prices.   I was pleasantly surprised by this Joeys. Service has been good, as has the food, however the prices are what you would expect for a chain. The bartender, Sam, who we have had on two occasions is very sweet. She even bought a guest a birthday card the last time we were there - definitely went the extra mile.   The ramen is much better than one might expect. Very flavourful with a hearty portion of chicken and a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. The chicken tasted like it was from a backyard barbecue and had perfect grill marks while still retaining all of its moisture. I will probably get this dish again if/when I go back - it was that good.   The retractable roof on the second floor is worth another visit to check out. Sherway is definitely stepping up its dining options with the addition of Joeys and The Keg. Overall, an above-average spot for a post-shopping refuel."}
{"text":"Their food prices are slightly higher than average but I would say it's worth it. I had the Tuna Sashimi Salad which was played beautifully and tasted amazing. It was surprisingly filling, I wouldn't have wanted more than what I got. We had 7 people at our table which was a little squished. I would have preferred some elbow room. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, we never had to flag her down. And although the food is pricier than some other places, the drinks were very reasonably priced. The special on Sundays is $5 Caesers. It's not the type of place I would go to often but it's great for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Relaxing casual and fine environment and I like the food portion here, not too much, especially for ladies. Foods are usually prepared neatly and service is wonderful. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place! I was quite surprised at how nice it is inside. The wait staff is very friendly and with so many tables you shouldnt have a problem getting seats. Food was very good! I had the bahn mi and it was very tasty. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience at the JOEY over the last few years and have been here many times as it's close to work and home. The food is always consistently good. Chain restaurants aren't my thing but I really love this place. I brought a friend for a celebration dinner who had never been to JOEY here last night and had sub par service which was embarrassing because I had raved about this place to my friend before we got there.   We were at the end of a servers shift and had a different server for most of our stay who didn't seem to happy to be taking over our table at all. Not warm at all. We were either rushed with questions to order dinner or not attended to at all, to the point where we had to a neighbouring server twice to order a second round of drinks. No water refills while our glasses were empty. Dirty appetizer plates left on our table for a long while. Once the server realized we were not happy we were provided with complimentary champagne and smiles - a little late and more alcohol was not necessary on a Sunday night at that point.   Disappointing - please don't seat people in someone's section if they are off and another server isn't interested in provided a great experience. We had other options last night and should have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm going to tell you a personal account of their Exceptional Customer Service. First of all, I would like to say that anyone doubting this story is free to contact me to fact check what I am about to tell you. Last month a good friend and I were seated at the bar about to watch the World Canadian Juniors (lose). We had been at the bar since 6pm enjoying the atmosphere, with cold Guinness on Draft when we ordered two steak dinners so we could enjoy the game. At the moment our amazing perfectly cooked steaks arrived, both medium, we were informed that they had run out of Guinness on tap. When I asked to speak to the manager I was hoping to simply point out politely that we are regulars and how disappointed we were. The manager, Cody took full responsibility and offered us his honest explanation of missing the order window. He admitted it was totally on him and he graciously excused himself. He walked away. While we continued to eat our fine steak, we said the only thing that could make this meal perfect was a pint of Guinness. We even chuckled that perhaps they will comp us something. Surely had we been anywhere that has customer service focus, some gesture would be made?  The more we discussed it, the more disappointed we were that nothing had been done. Then we joked that if we were on 5 star resort they would go and borrow a keg from the next resort over. Anything to keep the customers happy right?  About 10 minutes passed when Codyappeared before us with two cold Guinness draft beers and when we asked what happened we realized he had gone out of the restaurant when he excused himself. What did he do?  Something fantastic in our eyes. He went to the LCBO and bought us Guinness!  We whaled and hi-fived him!  It was a brilliant customer service move. He took a bad customer service situation and made a huge positive out of it. The other patrons at the bar literally clapped when they realized what had happened. To Sandra and Corey and all the awesome employees at this great establishment I say (with a slow clap) BRAVO!"}
{"text":"There's no real surprises when it comes to Joey. It's a chain all over the city however, when it entered in the Sherway mall it was an exciting addition due to the lack of options in the area.   After a men's fashion show at Saks last night I was getting a little hungry. Decided on Joey as I hadn't been inside this location. We were sat instantly and despite it being a Wednesday at 8:30 this place was PACKED!!   Started with the pork dumplings which were the opposite of flavorful and then had the rainbow roll and baja fish tacos. Both of those items were delish. There's not a ton of wine options by the glass but we managed.   Now, I thought the dumplings were going to be the downside of the night but unfortunately that service is HORRENDOUS! I understand busy but we sat there with no food left, no wine and no water for approx. 15 minutes before our server returned. At that point I had lost momentum and quickly called it a night (God only knows when she would have returned if I ordered anything else...). So, no more wine, no dessert...so sad but perhaps when this place is a bit more dated, operationally it'll run a little bit smoother."}
{"text":"Joey has always been my go to restaurant for any type of celebration. Every time my boyfriend and I visit, we order the ahi tuna tacos and calamari to share. I get the CAB prime sirloin, and he gets the filet mignon. Ahi tuna tacos used to come in 4 pieces, with a crispy taco for base and seared tuna on top with wasabi mayo. However, they recently changed their menu, and this became the Hawaiian tuna tacos, which comes in only 3 pieces (my boyfriend and I had to split the third piece), with the same crispy taco for base but topped with raw tuna and filled with rice. As a regular customer, I felt ripped off, and really disappointed because they aren't nearly as good as they were before. The calamari comes with asparagus on the side - pretty good but nothing too special. Both steaks come with crispy mashed potatoes, which are absolutely amazing (I don't know why other restaurants don't do this). The steaks are done pretty consistently, never undercooked or overcooked.     Food is good quality overall, but I find that the service is inconsistent. There was one time we were seated in the lounge. We had just finished our appetizers, and I dripped some sauce on the table. The waitress quickly wiped down the table with a napkin because she didn't want me to dirty my white blouse, which was very sweet of her. However, the last time I visited, we were in the dining room, and it was difficult to wave down our waiter. There was also some dried food stuck on the glassware. Since then I've had the suspicion that we get better service in the lounge, and always ask to be seated in the lounge area."}
{"text":"Joey's was an overall decent experience for my family and myself. In spite of making a reservation, we were made to wait for 10-15 mins till we got a table that was unoccupied from the time we'd entered the restaurant.  The burger and chicken banh mi sandwich are really good.  Initially the menu looked small and as I read through all the dishes I realized it's good enough to have limited options. However their wine selection is pretty vast. Approximate cost for 5 people is around $90-$100 that excluded drinks, appetizers and dessert.  Would I go there again? Yes I would."}
{"text":"The service here is always fantastic everytime my family and I come here - never once have they disappointed. Some of our go-to items are the yam fries, tuna salad, salmon rice bowl, baja fish tacos, filet mignon. All the food items we've tried are always tasty. The tuna salad is very refreshing with an Asian style dressing. The salmon rice bowl is charred nicely and the variety of vegetables add the perfect crisp. Also, we love to order the steak with a side of mushroom soup and drizzle it over the rice"}
{"text":"I swore I'd never eat at a Joeys again after the second time. I had gone to both Yorkdale & Eaton Centre locations and gotten two different dishes, and both times was unimpressed. So this time I caved only because a coworker brought me here and I didn't want to pick a different place (ha).  I got the baja fish tacos. They caught my eye first even though its something I normally wouldn't consider getting, especially at a place like Joey. I'm glad I did though because they were delicious! So now I plan on giving Joey as a chain a few more chances to redeem itself, especially this location being close to home and patio season around the corner."}
{"text":"Steak & sushi was a great experience but service s a little bit weak. the evironment s fancy."}
{"text":"El restaurante Es lindo si quieres tomar una copa de vino  La comida deja mucho question desear  Una gran desecion.  Precios juatos pero no recomiendo la comida Sin embargo lindo para tomar UNOs drinks  Buena terraza!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to have dinner here because she was craving their tuna salad. I've only been here once two years ago and it didn't impress me so I never felt the need to come back.   We ordered sliders to start, steak, and tuna salad. The sliders were good, my sister enjoyed her tuna salad and the steak was okay. I ordered medium but basically got well done... I probably should've ordered rare in order to get medium lol. I really liked that Joeys uses shoestring fries as that's my preferred cut but the cook was a little heavy handed with the salt.   I'll probably come back here when my sister is craving the tuna salad again but I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"One of good JOEY's restaurants. We had a birthday dinner here. The food and service is good. The waiting time is the same issue with any location. Overall it is a nice place to go to."}
{"text":"Great experience at JOEY Sherway! We've been to the locations at Shops at Don Mills and Eaton Centre, but the Sherway location was definitely our favourite. The architecture and decor of this location was amazing - so chic yet casual! Great mix of industrial and modern decor.   The service was fast and the staff very attentive. I found that the restaurant had a less pretentious vibe vs. the other locations that we've been to.   As for the food, we had the lettuce wraps, chili chicken and crispy mashed potatoes for appetizers. For the main, I had the BBQ Salmon Bowl. Everything was delicious!!! I would highly recommend the lettuce wraps and crispy mashed potatoes. The chili chicken was tasty, but not ground-breaking. The BBQ Salmon Bowl was also tasty and enjoyable but nothing particularly special. The presentation for all the food was amazing - the blend of colours was fantastic.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food tastes great! But the salmon portion is small, but what irks me is there is no portion control. My friend's salmon was noticeably bigger and thicker.  The line up is insane! Always over thirty minute wait.  I guess it's worth it because taste wise, the salmon with crispy mashed is great and the tuna tataki salad is awesome!!! That's my favourite and I guess it's worth the wait for that. Large portion and very tasty.  Overall, in comparison to other chain restaurants, the main entrees are great! The appetizers are just average.  Portions are smaller.  But taste is better than other chain restaurants."}
{"text":"If you never had authentic butter chicken and are okay with mediocre quality, then this dish is for you!  The sauce wasn't creamy enough, had the consistency of soup. The chicken dish also had some vegetables in there so it tasted more like a stew than an Indian dish.   Both the rice and naan were rather dry, but this went great with my soupy chicken.   I would return to try something else, but say no to the butter chicken!"}
{"text":"Okay no.   I've been to Joey's many times and it's actually one of my favourite chain restaurant compared to like Earls, Moxies etc. But this recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth.   I was a party of 3 and we booked reservations for 8pm and two of us arrived 8pm on the dot and was told our table wasn't ready. We weren't seated until 8:20pm.   Besides that everything else was good, our server kept checking up since we were still waiting for one.   Anyways I got the Lobster Ravioli and two of my friends got the Chicken Parm one with tomato sauce and one with Alfredo. Literally 5 mins into our meal my friend saw a fruit fly walking on her plate and didn't know what to do so she squished it and we called our server over to let her know we found a bug in her dish and that's when things went downhill.   She was really confused on what to do and because she was confused we got confused. She even asked if we were sure that it was a bug that we found and we told her to look at it because it had wings. Then we got frustrated because she kept asking if we were sure that it was a bug and kept asking if we wanted a new order, we assumed that she would've just taken the dish away and automatically redid the order but my friend was frustrated and told her to just leave it.   My friend started to eat far away from where the bug was because she was hungry and the manager came and addressed the manner and we said it was fine and she ended up taking the dish away. My friend was left sitting there with no food when we were literally just starting our meals. I only ate like 4 pieces of ravioli and ended up stopping because I lost my appetite after all this.   The server covered my friends meal and her drink which was a good intention so we appreciate that but just how everything else was handled is going to make me take some time away from Joeys."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is high quality and delicious. Staff is very polite and the restaurant is beautiful!  Also located in a perfect location. This is the go to place it you're looking for good food, nice ambiance and a fun time with friends."}
{"text":"I went to JOEY Sherway celebrating with my boyfriends family. We waited less than 5 minutes to get a seat (make sure you get your name on the waitlist online!) The place is beautifully decorated inside and out. There's also a rooftop patio for the warmer days.   Food was great! We got the Pesto Shrimp Flatbread ($15) as an appetizer. It was unexpectedly spicy, but good if you can handle the kick! I was disappointed they didn't have the Beach salad at this location -it's one of my favourites! But, I got the steak & sushi ($26.50) and it was amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking but was on the saltier. The 8 piece rainbow sushi is amazing and melts in your mouth.  For dessert, we tried all of the three options they had -couldn't resist!.  My favourite was the Molten Chocolate Cake ($9). The perfect and warm lava cake went well with the ice cream. The apple pie ($9) was very good too! Warm and flaky crust with perfectly sweetened apples.  I've been to quite a few JOEYS and my favourite remains to be the Don Mills location; because they offer lobster grilled cheese and the beach salad. This location is definitely a close second though!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I love everything on their menu, especially the Spanish Paella, Bombay Butter Chicken and Peach Bellini!"}
{"text":"Flawless! So far this place has become my favourite hang out place, especially late night for bear and delicious meals."}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars. If ever, however the service my wife and I received tonight was exceptional. Tonight was our anniversary and we decided to hit up Joeys, even though we were here two weeks ago, tonight the staff hit it out of the park.   Tonight we were served by Jonita and she was amazing, she was so hospitable she made us feel right at home. When she found out it was our anniversary, she took it upon herself to bring us two glasses of  Prosecco - twice!   Our dinner was also exceptional as I had the New York strip lion, that was cooked to my liking. The side dish of deep fried mashed potatoes was orgasmic!!! Well done.   Overall, we were pleased with our experience....more so than two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, it was mediocre at best. We will definitely come back real soon, and hopefully be served by Jonita, she deserves some praise for her service."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday evening no wait was seated right away. Our server was friendly and attentive she offered a sample of the drink I wanted to make sure I liked it.  The Frosé was delicious tasted like frozen wine! But I did expect a little more based off the price of the drink.  I ordered the California chicken sandwich. Which is a grilled chicken sandwich with spicy mayo and bacon. It was filling! Tasted fresh and flavorful also enjoyed fries."}
{"text":"I was here for an early lunch the other day.  I was starving!  The restaurant filled up quickly as it approached noon (get here early if you can).  I ordered the spicy chicken banh mi sandwich and sweet potato fries and they were delish!  My DC had the burger and fries (it looked pretty substantial) and the lettuce wraps.  Everything was pretty tasty and the resto is nice!"}
{"text":"Great service here. New winter menu so I tried the spaghetti and meatballs. Very tasty with the ricotta cheese. Meatballs were very large. The only thing I wish was that the sauce was a bit less thick. It was a heavy meal."}
{"text":"I think this location has more staff than it needs. For a party of 12, we had two servers. Didn't think it was necessary - none of them checked up on us anyways after we got our meal. Service overall was good though - friendly and always smiled!  We ordered the rainbow roll, pesto shrimp flatbread, and shrimp lettuce wrap to start. I think these apps are better at the Yorkdale location - especially the lettuce wraps. The rainbow roll rice was mushy- but I still thought it tasted pretty good.   For main - I got the salmon. It's ok - nothing special and the piece of salmon was so small. Huge margins on the food ( what you pay vs what you get is not worth it ).   My biggest feedback is that we ordered bottles of wine (they have good wine selection), however, they did not give us a wine chiller. They just put it on the table...and when we ordered a second bottle - they did not replace our glasses.   I would go back - but I think the sandwiches and appetizers are better than the pricier dishes. Keg is right next door so if I'm going to pay $30+ for just my meal, might as well go there."}
{"text":"Two-and-a-half stars.  This looks like a typical mall restaurant: Lots of tinted glass windows, booths, and young women dressed in short black dresses. A modern dining cliche.  The service was good. The food prices were a bit on the high side, and while the plating looks nice, the portions are small. I had the herb crush salmon with mashed potatoes - soft, garlic mashed as well as \"crispy\" mashed (wrapped in a crispy shell) and \"today's vegetables\" (there were hardly any vegetables on the plate)  The food was good, but not outstanding.  I can't say that there was anything wonderful about the place, nor can I think of anything that's terrible. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again, but the experience was okay."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Joey Sherway for his birthday dinner. I used their website to make reservations a week prior to today and the earliest dinner slot available was 4:30. This was perfect for us because we don't like eating late. Anyways today they called to confirm the reservation which was great. Upon arriving we were a little early (4:20) and they were still prepping the table which was cool with us. Shortly after we were seated at our table and given menus. A girl came around after five minutes to take drink orders but our server Christina took TEN minutes before she even came to see us or take our order. Needless to say we weren't very impressed with the service. When she did finally come she was very nice and knowledgable regarding the ingredients of the meals. Which was great because the pasta my boyfriend was going to order apparently was a fusion of Japanese flavours (something that the menu did not indicate) and contained strong flavours of seaweed (something he happens to highly dislike). He ended up ordering the butter chicken and I got the Baja fish tacos. For an app we ordered the calamari which was soooo delicious. Our food came very promptly to the table and everything was really tasty and decently priced. Once we finished our meal the plates were all cleared off and again we waited another solid 10 minutes before we finally were exhausted of waiting. I asked a passing by waitress for the bill and I guess she went and talked to our waitress and she finally came back. Overall we give Joey Sherway a 4 because the service (minus the food delivery) was sooo slow. They needed more wait staff because the lines at the door was ridiculous and you had people like us patiently waiting to leave. Something definitely worth management looking into"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day and the food was satisfying yet basic. I had the baja fish tacos with fried fish, shrimp, and guacamole in a soft shell, however it was served with hot sauce?! Ideally, one would expect salsa on the side, but no - it was hot sauce. But apart from that, the taco itself was alright - I give it a 3.   Apart from the food, service was great and the place was packed. I might come again."}
{"text":"Good food good service. The wait staff is very attractive- just wonder if they are looking for that when they are hiring. Fun but a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Service is always great here. I usually come at night to watch the basketball games. Even better when you hit happy hour for their 4 dollar beers!"}
{"text":"In summary:  excellent and attentive staff, tasty food, fun atmosphere.  Probably not suitable for families based on age restriction for lounge (longer wait time) or large groups (unless you can get a reservation) great for double date or couples.  Bar has a great vibe.  We have been to the JOEY at Yorkdale before and this one was even better.  The servers team serve and they are very attentive.  The pace of the meal was a little too quick for us but the food was great.  I had the tenderloin (filet mignon) with their signature mash potatoes that come in the form of a spring roll (covered lightly with sour cream, bacon and green onion / chive?) and their yummy shoe string French fries which are my favorite fry out there (in lieu of the vegetable).  The wife had the butter chicken which was very good and a large portion.  We actually started with the rainbow sushi (maki) roll which had a very decent grade of tuna and a great flavour profile.  The food was very well priced for location and quality.  All the staff were very friendly, attentive, and inviting as if they wanted our business (a rare thing imo).  The wait time on a Saturday at 7:00pm was 1 hour for the dinning room though.  We opted for the lounge and were told a 25 min wait.  8 minutes later we were seated.  We sat at the bar and the staff introduced themselves by name and asked for ours (and remembered).  Needless to say the staff seem very well trained for improved experience.  Nothing was left to sit on the table dirty for someone to clear as all staff seem to clear if/when they walk by any table.  Overall the staff were also very attractive by design it seems.  No complaints.  It was fun to be able to see the massive kitchen at work.  I counted 25 just at the front line.  To a fault they serve very fast but it is far better than the alternative.  We were in and out in about an hour and a half with three courses, pre and post dinner drinks.  If you go as a family the lounge is restricted to 19+ so wait times are long based on what we heard by other patrons.  I would recommend this to most.  The age group is younger but diverse, atmosphere is modern, food is tasty, decently priced, with excellent service.  A pleasant surprise for a great experience."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5.  I've been to the other Joey's establishments at Yorkdale and Don Mills, and my experience here was pretty on par as the other Joey's.  However, the bartender who also took our order was top notch with her customer service.  That was the stand out for me.  My gf and I came here on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed.  We stood waiting at the hostess desk for about 5 minutes wondering when one of the 4 girls behind the counter would acknowledge us.  I decided to just say hi, and hope someone would attend to us.  They automatically thought we had gotten a text to say our table was ready instead of thinking we just walked in to get a table. After all that my gf and I saw chairs by the bar and I asked if those were first come first serve.  She said absolutely.  So we went ahead and seated ourselves there.  The chairs were comfy and the bar wasn't too busy so it was great.  One of the bartenders took our order and she was very attentive especially with my order.  I ordered the fish tacos; however, it does come with shrimp and I am allergic to shrimp.  I told her about my allergy and she made sure that I was just allergic to shellfish and not fish.  My gf ordered the lobster grilled cheese, to sabotage me of course so I couldn't try any of her food (lol).  The food took awhile to come out.  My gf's sweet potato fries were cold when they arrived.  There was a confusion when bringing out my fish tacos.  The server had two plates of fish tacos and wasn't clearly communicated that the one she gave me was the no shrimp one.  It was sorted in under 5 minutes though and she did in fact give me the correct plate.  The hostess and the bartender were very attentive and apologized repeatedly. The bartender also checked up on us regularly, which is where most of the stars are going.  My fish tacos were better than I had remembered. They were definitely tasty and the tortilla was a little crispy so it didn't get soggy at all.  My gf's sweet potato fries were so pinch.  If you compare it to a bowl of regular fries, you would agree.  I mean she's paying $2 extra, she could at least get the same amount as regular fries.  She also said the lobster grilled cheese was smaller in comparison to the other Joey's establishments.    Kudos to the bartender for taking such good care of us.  Very friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was amazing and the service was great and great atmosphere and the best food I ever had so I high recommend this place and it's great for party and gathering!!"}
{"text":"This is only my 2nd time at a Joey; the first time visiting the Markham location.   Suits and Luncheon Ladies seem to be the clientele. Service was prompt and friendly. Paella tasted like it had been sitting pre-cooked for a bit (was not made to order), and the seared ahi tuna salad was over dressed, and had too much fish sauce flavour.  I mentioned the over-dressed salad to my server and she passed my feedback to the kitchen.   The place is nice, and is that ideal feel of an evolving Sherway Gardens in the beat of suburbia.  Ultimately not bad, and a nice place to bring your Mom for lunch."}
{"text":"My cousin took me here today and I was really impressed by the ambiance and the decor. This definitely a unique place and probably the most impressive dine in restaurant I've been to in my 1 week visit to Toronto.  The food is spectacular. The place is clean. The prices are on the expensive side, but worth the quality I guess. Comparatively speaking they actually have good value for a typical family restaurant in Toronto.  I was very disappointed that we didn't get Happy Hour Prices. Our bill which was around 100$ could have been about 10$ cheaper for items we ordered off the happy hour menu.  After paying I notified the waitress and she apologized. I wasn't looking for the money back, but she wasn't too clear about wanting to make the correction. I didn't feel it was worth the effort and I also had a guest which I wouldn't have made a stink like this with them around.   Not Appreciated!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that our trip to Joey Sherway didn't get off to the best start, since we checked in just before our reservation and didn't get our table for another 15 minutes or so - despite the fact that the table we did get was sitting empty the entire time.  (Service was otherwise quite efficient and friendly, so I'm not sure what happened there.)  Anyway, after perusing the extensive menu, I finally decided to go with The Butcher's Sandwich (\"smoky jus, crispy onions, dijon, rosemary salt, Certified Angus Beef\").  This is actually a far better sandwich than I was expecting. (It's certainly a cut above other chain joints like Kelsey's and Montana's.) I was a little worried when the dish first arrived to the table, as the bread looked way too crusty for my liking. But it was actually pretty perfect: it had a certain amount of crust but was mostly soft and delicious.  The beef was definitely the star attraction here. It was juicy and flavorful, and even better, it never became difficult to chew (as is sometimes the case with this kind of meat). The accompanying mustard and crispy onions proved a perfect complement, and the jus was good but perhaps the weakest element in the dish (i.e. it wasn't smoky in the slightest).  The shoestring fries were addictive as hell, too."}
{"text":"This was great but now it has failed and very sadly. I ordered a dinner at this place and it just sucked. My food was under cooked and when I said something they did not remove it from my bill or even cook me a new plate. Instead they took the same piece of food and just reheated it. The service is just not good, I am not going to come back at all. This place was so amazing but it has sadly fallen. If you want just drink then it's the place to come but to eat here, well I would NOT waste my time or money."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and better than average food and music on a Friday. The protein burger and yam fries were the perfect touch for the Paleo enthusiast. The bartenders were efficient and friendly and kept both the newbies and the regulars feeling special. Very good experience."}
{"text":"This may actually have been the worst restaurant experience of my entire life. I wish this was an understatement, I really do; the staff were very nice, the atmosphere good, the food overpriced but not bad. But they are so completely in over their heads trying to run a restaurant.  We were a polite and well-mannered group of about 12. It took almost 30 minutes after ordering our drinks for me to receive an underpoured beer in a dirty glass - and it was the wrong beer. Most of our meals arrived soon after our first round of drinks. One person's meal lagged behind, arriving \"in just a minute\" - for almost 30 minutes. She ate after everyone else. Nobody ever checked on drinks, empty glasses all around, we had to try ordering from other staff as they bussed our table. There were a few beers on the menu I planned on having but I only managed to order two.  When we asked for our bills - which the servers had been running separately, by name, since the start, at their own suggestion - it actually took over 45 minutes. Longer than you could ever possibly imagine, with everyone already three hours into a very long meal and eager to get home.  Various servers and managers stared at a screen trying to get the bills figured out. At one point they even came back and auctioned off some beers they had lost track of. Finally they processed everyone's credit card except mine, and I had to chase them down to pay while others had already left.  TL;DR, sat down at 6:45 for post-work dinner and drinks, only managed to have a burger and two beers, and still didn't make it out until 10:30. With good service and food that lives up to the pricing, this could be a good restaurant, but I honestly can't see myself ever going back to find out."}
{"text":"It's JOEY, but hey it's at Sherway.  Good vibes, good restaurant as expected from JOEY.  A good restaurant experience similar to the other JOEYs that I have been too - Shops on Don Mills, Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale.  Good patio and great place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Note:  There is NO direct access from the mall.  You have to exit through Door 3, walk outside the mall, and use the separate restaurant entrance.  Sorta dumb.  Service - 3/5 Food - 3.5-4/5 Atmosphere - 5/5  Disclosure:  I avoid going to chain restaurants, but sometimes it's unavoidable when you're in a group and the majority wants to eat at Milestones, Pickle Barrel, Earl's, Moxie's, etc.  Inevitably, I'm bound to bend...  I'm just always suspicious as these places seem more about the atmosphere, loud music, scantily clad servers that look like they're out on a casting call, and less about the FOOD.  Anyway, I was greeted by a gaggle of hostesses in LOFT-style gray dresses.  They were friendly and one was particularly very engaging, asking if it was our first time, if we wanted anything, etc.  A group of women who were in front of us got mimosas while waiting, but we were not addressed.  Ok, but somewhat awkward seeing how we were literally right beside the mimosa women.  Seating did not take long at all, as per hostess it was approx. 15mins on a Saturday, after lunch service, around 2pm.  Aside from the Apps/Steaks, prices seem to average ~$15.  Menu consisted of a mix of Asian-inspired sushi dishes, including gyoza, Dragon roll/sushi cones, sandwiches, burgers, & steak.  Menu's online, so no surprises on the pricing.  FOOD: Yam Fries - $9 + 0.75 for grana padano.  No one mentioned that there was an extra charge for the cheese.  Serving was on the smaller side, decent for 2 ppl, but pricy for portion that arrived.  Yams aren't expensive, just don't charge for the cheese and we'll call it even, non?  Farmer Market Chicken Salad - $16.50, good flavour, would've been better with a bit more chicken in it.  Barely visible.  My bf had to dig pieces out when I asked where the chicken was.  Baja Fish Tacos - $15.5, REALLY GOOD!  Came with 3 tacos.  Apple Pie w/ ice cream - $9, this came recommended, especially for sharing, but honestly, it was just ok.  Sounded better than it tasted.  It was slices of apple on top of a filo pastry.  Ice cream had a really good texture and apparently it is made every morning!  SERVICE: I think they're still working out the kinks.  Joey is one of those places where there's a bunch of people who are wearing specific uniforms and each person with a specific uniform does a specific duty.  The girls in gray greet/seat you, someone takes your drink order/tells you the specials, a chick in a tight black tank serves you, another guy brings the food to your table, etc.  So during my lunch, I was told the wrong price for one of their drink specials (it was subsequently taken off the bill), there was a loooong wait for the dessert, & a loooong wait for the bill.  By loooong, I'm talking at least 20mins.  Apparently our bill was given to another table & there was something finicky about the billing system.  Other than that, most of the workers seem very friendly and upbeat.  VERDICT?  Fun atmosphere with BOOM 97.3-like music playing, upbeat and friendly servers, food was actually pretty good, I don't think you'll be taking home any leftovers as portions are \"just right\", & prices are a bit higher than food court.  Also worth mentioning that I felt as though there was soo much wasted space on the second level.  Washrooms are also on the second floor which means you hafta go up 2 flights of stairs to access them.  It would've been nice if there was a private dining room on the second level."}
{"text":"I'm sure there's a reason but no direct access to the mall seems not logical. The baja fish tacos are great but lost a little love when my fitness pal said they are 650 calories. #wegetyoumoving #idorun"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 4.5/5 Great restaurant all-around. Good place to visit for lunch before shopping at Sherway, or after shopping for an evening dinner. Only had an issue one time, with a dish not meeting its usual expectations, however the manager reached out to compensate.  Food: 5/5 Never had a dish I didn't like. Today I decided to try something new and get the Ahi Tuna Club Sandwich, as per a friend's recommendation, and I left wanting more. I had it with a side of Caesar salad, which was an additional $2 up-charge. Portion sizes are fair. I left feeling satisfied.  Service: 4/5 Just from observation during dinner service, all of the staff are very friendly and willing to provide recommendations to diners.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Very lively and premium atmosphere with LOTS of seating. However wait times can get pretty long depending on time and day, despite the abundance of seating. There is a large outdoor patio on the second floor, great for summer days. The restaurant has a diverse crowd of business professionals, to couples, to families with children.  Tips & Recommendations: -California Chicken Sandwich highly recommended -Ahi Tuna Club Sandwich highly recommended -Washrooms are on the second floor, elevators are available for those who require -Plenty of parking, as the restaurant is located on Sherway Gardens property -No indoor access between JOEY and the mall -Lunch Time Friendly? Yes -Date Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding however service lack big time. Came her solo and sat at the bar. Appetizer was not put in and was later comped. Then ordered dessert and it also was not put in."}
{"text":"Went to Joeys for a company Christmas dinner at the Easton Centre location and it was just okay. However I must say this location was much better. Everything was fresh and presented well. We had the Baja tacos to start, pretty good but not amazing. My husband had the hand pressed burger and I went with the ravioli with lobster cream & grilled prawns. The burger seemed too large and it kept falling apart! Super messy and frustrating to eat. However my meal was very good. It had the perfect consistency of sauce and flavour. If you're a pasta lover like myself, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Last September, we came to JOEY at Sherway Gardens to send our two co-op students on their merry way back to university. Our team had to vote between two restaurant choices. This one won by a convincing margin!  I made reservations over the phone. The person said that she would send me a photo by e-mail of the exact table where we would be seated. I was impressed! You also got an e-mail reminder about you reservation.  We were a group of eight. We got there, I gave the hostess my name, and we were led to the table. Yes, it looked exactly like the photo!  Both co-op students ordered the filet mignon that came with grilled zucchini, crispy mashed potatoes, and blue cheese butter. Everything looked so good that one of them let me take a photo of it. It helps that we are all foodies.  I went with the miso ramen. It was so good! It tasted authentic.  There is a lot of variety on the menu. I think that it would appease even the pickiest person.  The two students had indicated that they were going back to school to our server. All three of us ordered the molten lava cake that came with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberries. Their plates had raspberry and chocolate sauce that said good luck. It was a nice touch.  The molten lava cake was delicious. It is probably one of the best lava cakes that I have sampled in years.  The washrooms are on the top floor, which means that you have to climb a set of stairs to get there. I saw a couple of folks in their sixties slowly make the ascent. I don't know whether there are elevators for accessibility. I hope so!  It was a wonderful farewell for them and an excellent lunch had by all.  (32)"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great food. Went with my parents and my son. They even had high chairs for up to 37lbs kids (high chair attaches to table). Relatively loud (music) but I didn't mind that. Still able to have conversations. Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"Oh joeys. You need to step up your game with the menu and meal execution. The only thing that keeps bringing me back are their flat breads but other than that and their lobster grilled cheese their menu items are so lackluster. Sliders...dry. sushi cones are good but they shove a lot of rice in there. The steak I got wasn't how I ordered (medium well instead of medium) and it was just meh. No real flavour and was dry. My bfs steak and sushi wasn't that great either ..although the marinade on his was good. The sushi had way too much rice and has that fishy taste which means it wasn't fresh.  Like come on. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst Joey ever! Really bad service- asked for water refill and never got it. Waitress disappeared for over 30 minutes. Food is overly salty! Wi"}
{"text":"JOEY Sherway just opened about week ago. I've been to the other two locations at Eaton Centre and Yorkdale and have always had good experiences there! JOEY Sherway definitely met my expectations!   Service and Environment  Like their other locations, JOEY tends to get really busy during peak hours. So it's best to make reservations, if not their wait list isn't too bad and you can shop around the mall while you wait! The service was good but unfortunately a bit slow.  Food Spanish Paella:  This was my first time trying this dish and it was absolutely delicious! The paella was very flavourful filled with shrimp, chorizo, and chicken in a lobster saffron broth. The rice also had a nice caramelized crust on the bottom of the pan.  Sashimi Tuna: Seared ahi with mangos, avocado, and an asian inspired dressing. It's a great salad dish mixed with a lot of Asian fusion flavours."}
{"text":"The food here was okay. I just had the Superfood 500 salad because I was craving healthy at the time - it could have used a boost of flavour, but I still enjoyed it. There are a lot of other intriguing items on the menu I'd like to try too, such as their sushi and salmon rice bowl.  What stood out for me about this restaurant was the service. Our server was over the top friendly and made it a great experience. I'd come back again because of this."}
{"text":"it's an okay bar or restaurant. Food was okay but very beautiful or delicated...morden decor"}
{"text":"Love this joeys - atmosphere is chic, drinks are tasty and plenty of eye candy around! Like anything at Sherway, be prepared to wait. I've never come here on a Thursday evening and have been able to snag a seat (at the bar or otherwise!) usually a 2+ hour wait. Every time, I end up heading to the Keg next door and indulging in my martinis there. Other days are usually better and wait is not as long.  Food is pretty good here too, the drinks are better."}
{"text":"The food at joey's is always good. I just took off one star because they got rid of the lobster grilled cheese sandwich (basically my life). I had their house-made veggie burger w/ sweet potato fries & I have to say, it looks great, but was not good! I consider myself a veggie burger connoisseur, and I've had way better! The four stars is for all the other great food they have here"}
{"text":"Always a good time at JOEY!  It was my sisters birthday and we got a nice big booth ! The server was amazing and so friendly and outgoing! We ordered 2 calamari appetizers and the tandoori chicken flat bread YUMM! Everyone got steak or salmon for their meal. The plates were licked clean! LoL The ambiance is amazing- super trendy and cool! You know it's cool when there is an elevator in the restaurant !"}
{"text":"My first experience with Joey's was at the Yorkdale location but because I live closer to Sherway and frequent this location more- my review will be based solely on my experiences at this location.  I think Joey's is a great place if you are looking for delicious food, drinks and a great ambiance. It's a breath of fresh air from other major chains as you can actually have a decent conversation with the person next to you as you are not competing with the music. I especially love the layout of Joey's and how open concept the space is. Booths and tables are spacious, comfortable and inviting.   Most of the time you are waiting for a table because their restaurants are usually situated in hub spots. Although the restaurant is large, they only have seating on the main floor (unless the patio is open), so, prepare to wait. The waiting isn't draining at Joey's because a lovely hostess usually comes around with some champagne (YASS!) and some yummy food samples. I think all restaurants should adopt this sort of hospitality. Hungry folks that are waiting for a table aren't always the most pleasant but give me something to nibble and sip on and my \"hangry\" attitude will slowly diminish.     The Patio is an absolute MUST when it's open. I cannot explain how gorgeous it is and although the view isn't much (over looking the parking lot) it actually is a beautiful site on a nice day. They have large high top wooden tables that actually have comfortable chairs, a rustic vintage table with throws if you get a little cold and a cute couch/booth table set up along the side. The space is so inviting; you almost forget that you are at a restaurant.  FOOD  Food wise, I haven't been extremely daring or adventurous. If you are ever looking for something to sink your teeth into without feeling the aftermath of \"guilt\", try their Veggie Burger. Trust me, as a burger gal, this shit has changed my life. I even googled the recipe to make my own version at home. It is absolutely delicious and has great texture which sometimes can be a miss with a veggie burger. The almonds and beans are a perfect duo and add a nice crunch to the burger. The only thing I would suggest for the Veggie burger is that they calm down on the cucumber. I think I had about 5 slices in mine! Aside from that though, 5 stars for this piece of work. It also comes with a side of skinny fries enough to feed a village.  Their calamari is a delicious starter and is extremely crispy but not greasy and is paired with fried asparagus and fennel (yes that is the mystery vegetable, it is not an onion folks). If they had an appetizer of just the fried asparagus, I'd probably order about 3 rounds because it's just THAT good (hint hint). Who knew that fried asparagus would be a hit?  A few girlfriends of mine shared the Pesto Shrimp Flatbread once upon a time and it was simply, mouthwatering! It has a spicy kick and the toppings t work well with each other. This is a great option if you are looking to share some starters with a group.   Their baja fish tacos in my opinion were just OK. It lacked in flavour and just overall fell short.   And last but not least, I left the best for last. A month ago we took a girlfriend out for her birthday and we split the molten chocolate cake as a treat and I'm not even joking when I say that all three of us were grunting with every single bite. This piece of heaven is paired with a house made nitro vanilla bean ice-cream. Damn. If only I could express the joys that my taste buds were experiencing into words. If I am ever craving a dessert, I wouldn't even hit a dessert place, I'd drag my ass straight to Joey's for this.   STAFF Overall I have never had a bad experience with their staff. They are usually friendly, knowledgeable with the food and drink menu and always offer samples when choosing wine which is something I like to see at restaurants. I typically grab a drink at the bar when I am waiting for my table and the gentlemen and gal behind the bar are ALWAYS super friendly, attentive and quick. They truly make the experience pleasant.   Joey's is slowly becoming a favourite spot of mine and I'm excited to come back and perhaps this time try something new ;)."}
{"text":"Can't believe it I haven try this place since I moved here two years ago. To be honest, the name of the restaurant did not sound delicious to me. But it turned out, I definitely want to go back there again!   It is a higher end restaurant/bar. They have many categories of food. From Asian to Mediterranean. My mom had this amazing tuna salad, it had a very nice performance. The tuna was rare with a nice golden touch on the outside. The salad put together with a very balanced flavor and texture.  I had a steak and sushi dish. Also it had a very nice touch. The steak was marinated in a soy-sauce-like sauce---this was a little bit too salty for me. But the sushi was really good.   We also had another two steak dish. Both came with very unique mash potato covered with spring roll covering.    Yam fries was good with fresh garlic in it. This definitely added a different taste in my mouth!  I definitely will bring my friends over next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner on Saturday nights. Despite being very busy, they have excellent service. They have some interesting fusion type of food on their menu. I had their deep cauliflower that was a bit too sweet. I also had a salmon bowl which was excellent though I wouldve liked a bigger portion."}
{"text":"Joey's is one of the hippest restaurants in Etobicoke. Love the atmosphere here. The staff is courteous and good looking, especially the bartender, Audrey, she was my eye candy of the night."}
{"text":"While attending a meeting at Sherway Gardens we decided to have lunch at the new Joey's.  Upon our arrival we were promptly greeted with a smile at the hostess stand and seated nearby.   Several servers came to take our drink order. The drinks came quickly as did the refills. We ordered (2) 500 salads and one steak frits. Everything was good and prompt.   Overall we really enjoyed our lunch and we will tell others.  Good Luck"}
{"text":"Pretty delish lunch here today, ordered the paella. Wasn't spicy to my taste but I liked it. Hint of tanginess and delightfully seasoned with spice, lemon and vegetables. Served in a metallic croc pot, gives the dish an authentic Spanish flair. Joey's has great ambience too and the host came over to our table consistently to ask how everything was."}
{"text":"Went for New Years. Service and food was great. Happy hour is always an added plus. Everyone loves their meals. Highly recommended. Joeys is consistent no matter what location you go to. Sherway is no different."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday around 6pm on a Saturday and it was quite busy as one could imagine.  We got Pan Fried Gyoza to start. They were delicious and well seasoned. I got the Ravioli With Lobster Cream & Grilled Shrimp... It was so good and very rich! I got to have a bite of my friend's Paella and that was also tasty as well.  The food was great and the service was good. I'll definitely have to make a visit here again soon!"}
