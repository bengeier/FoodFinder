{"text":"With food trucks, there are three main qualities you look for: speed, cost, and food. Normally, you get to pick two. If it's fast and cheap, it's typically only decent. If it's solid and fast, you'll pay for it. With Sugar Daddy's you get it all. Great food, turned out fast, for a price that isn't a $18 grilled cheese. Plus, it's food you actually *want* to eat at a food truck -- you know, not a gourmet avocado salad that is not exactly going to pair well with your fifth beer at Food Truck Friday. The sliders are nuts. The sides are nuts (get the \"amaze balls\"). And you'll get back to your group faster than the huge line elsewhere. Get at it."}

Dang. These Southern Belle loaded fries... are bomb.com. Literally SO GOOD!!!!! Perfect mix of fries, pimiento cheese, pig candy, and spicy ranch were literally 10/10. I love pig candy- my husband makes his own and this might actually rival it. The cheese was perfectly melted. The spicy ranch could have been a smidge more spicy to balance the sweetness of the bacon, but I'm still not complaining. We also got a side of the normal ranch (both ranches homemade). For $7 and needing a snack, this was legit awesome. 

One small complaint was that the wait time was at least 25 minutes and there were only 2 orders in front of us. So maybe either have buzzers to leave and come back when food is ready, or try to find a way to speed it up a bit (especially just for an order of cheese fries). 

Overall, i can't wait to try their amaze balls and sliders next time we cross paths. Great job, guys!!"}
{"text":"Trying all the sliders - totally worth it!  My favorite was the Mac Daddy, but probably because we just moved back to the Carolinas from Colorado and I was missing some of that good old southern mac & cheese.  The Amaze Balls was true to its name... amaze balls.  If you're into sweet, savory, and the perfect combination between the two, Sugar Daddy's is where you need to be.  My husband really enjoyed the Pig Candy from the Sugar Daddy slider - if he could buy it by the bag, he would. ;)

If we lived closer to the area, I would definitely be visiting this food truck often!!"}
{"text":"Went to Sugar Daddy's at Lucky Dog, and it was worth it! The Sugar Daddy slider was my personal
favorite, followed by the Token White Guy. The Sliders are fantastic, but don't forget about the sides!! The Amaze Balls are appropriately named and were SO DELICIOUS!! The Bougie Lady fries hit the spot. I love that all the sauces are homemade and makes this truck unique. Definitely with a stop!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that everything tasted really good. My issue is with what you get for the price. The sliders, while delicious, were pretty measly. The sugar daddy slider is basically a kings Hawaiian roll with a spoonful of pimento and a third of a piece of bacon. Not very filling. They're version of a jalape√±o popper was good, but again, it was just three balls. For what it's worth, I'd be willing to try something like the loaded fries to see if that is more worth the price, because again, it was good food."}
