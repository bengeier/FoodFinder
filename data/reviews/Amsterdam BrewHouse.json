{"text":"The best part of this place is the view. We sat close to the open doors and could watch people walk by and a great view of the water all afternoon. The service was good, but the food was pretty pricey. We both had salads (no meat) and they were around $15 and pretty small. Unique options, with sandwiches, salads, pizzas, etc. Hubby thought the beer was alright, but go on a nice sunny day for the view."}
{"text":"It's nice to sit on the patio in the warm weather and watch the planes fly into Billy Bishop.  The interior of the restaurant is quite spacious and has a nice atmosphere as well.  Food is pretty good for bar food."}
{"text":"It's a Solid spot on the water to grab a beer or lunch or dinner. Perfect place to grab a drink before the Jays game and then walk over! Inside or outside on the patio will be sufficient."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place when we just want some chill time. I have 2 young kids and they like this place. The place has a nice vibe but don't expect top notch service. Kiddies like the pretzel and wings, hubby and I love their beer. The wait can be long but we just manage our expectations each time we go."}
{"text":"I returned to the BrewHouse this season, hoping service had improved since last year - it hasn't. Very disorganized, six clueless hostesses standing around yet not enough waitstaff. Had to argue with about 5 different people, including the manager, to get a table on the half empty patio - being told something different by each person. Otherwise, beer is OK (when they're not out) and food is also just OK - stick with the pizza. Friend in the group got food poisoning from the fish and chips. I'd rather buy a bottle from their beer store and take it in a brown-bag on harbourfront than to put up with this place again."}
{"text":"To give 1 more star, or not to give, that is the dilemma. I guess it's 4-star worthy. But on a rainy, cold March day, the view is not as exciting as I'm sure it is in the spring/summertime.   Overall, the atmosphere and d√©cor are really fresh and contemporary. There is a real charm and that's why I'm sure I noticed lots of business parties going on.  Our waiter was really friendly. He chatted with us ladies and remembered many details from out conversations all night. It made up for the fact that he kept getting our drinks confused! No harm, no foul. We all got what we ordered eventually!  My pizza wasn't as great as I'd expect from a wood-burning oven. I got the brewmeister's sausage pizza, and it was really sweet. Sweet sausage and caramelized onions just made too sweet of a flavor for me... but I should have known, I guess. I wish there was a build your own pizza option, cause I really wasn't digging the chicken and brie, loaded potato, anything with mushrooms, yet I wanted more than the classic. If I could have created my own pizza, I would have maybe given this place a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Walked out before we even made it to ordering food after experiencing truly abysmal service. Very disappointing, as we were looking forward to sampling the beers and had decided what we wanted to order.  Here's what happened: walked in, were greeted and seated promptly. Took quite a while for a server to come over to even ask what we wanted to drink and let us know which of the seasonal beers were on draft and also provide food menus. Finding out the seasonal beers led us to rethink our beer choices, so we only ordered water when the server came over and then figured out which beers and which food we wanted to order.  And then we waited. And waited. And waited. For at least 20 minutes. We saw our server go over to several other tables, but she never came back to us with our water... or to take our beer and food order. The last straw was when the table next to us put in an order for their second round of beers, received their beers... and still no server coming to take our order. So we walked out, after receiving... nothing.  It's too bad, because the food and beers sounded good and the location is lovely."}
{"text":"I love this place for its views, service and beer. The food is decent. Friendly staff, amazing views of the lake and a nice selection of Amsterdam beers."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss...First you cannot beat that patio in the summer time! It is a beautiful view of the water and perfect for an afternoon out.  Service can be great or horrible food can be great or horrible all depends on the time and the day.  Really wish there was more consistency but each time is a surprise.  The sangria is tasty and you can never go wrong with a flight of beer.  Poutine can be delicious (if you are there when it is not busy-and it is cooked properly) Overall, if you are looking to enjoy the view and you are willing to risk the chance of a bad experience it could turn out great!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Burger and fries were both cold when they arrived. Fries come in a tiny Little bowl that you might use for condiments. it took awhile to get another burger and 2nd one was lukewarm. I ate that one as I was starving. It wasn't bad. Wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Sometimes the best things come when you least expect them and this was certainly true for Amsterdam Brewhouse. I must confess that I did not try any of their craft beer which is presumably what this Brewhouse is famed for as I am not a lover of beer. I visited hoping to obtain a decent bar dinner with a good plate of food and a refreshing drink and that is what I got in the form of fish and chips and a very enjoyable berry cocktail. The food and drinks menus were actually noticeably extensive with a nice range to satisfy any palate.   However, my friends and I happened to be famished and feeling greedy that night so we ordered a another main dish having scoffed down our first. Our waitress, who was jovial as well as excellent at her job recommended the pizza, especially as the oven they use to cook the pizza 'has been shipped all the way from Milan' which she says makes the pizza that much better. So we ordered a classic pepperoni pizza to share and lo and behold it was practically mind-blowing how something so simple tasted so sublime. I do not recall ever having any pizza have that effect on me. It was so delicious I could have eaten a whole pizza myself despite already having eaten a main dinner that night. For me it provided the perfect balance of a light and crispy base with evenly distributed toppings of an ideal cut exuding flavour that does not go overboard but is finetuned to complement the dough just right. It is safe to say that my friends and I were flabbergasted and delighted by this sensational pizza.   Who'd have thought that a Brewhouse would serve up the best pizza? Not me, but I stand corrected. After all, often the best things come from the most unlikely of places. This one will live long in my memory."}
{"text":"Don't know how this place is rated 2.5 stars, it's legit.  Love the location on the water with the adirondack chairs, the back patio is a solid place to drink and watch sports and the beers are delish.    Honestly wish I lived up here for the fact that I could come here for some Sunday funday football action.  Bsd with 3 different guys working there too, all cool dudes.   Big fan of their French fries with the garlic dipping sauce and raspberry beers, will be back fo' sho"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.   You'll need to arrive before noon to get a spot on the patio, which is right along the water and will get sun all afternoon.  There's a covered patio area too.   The smoke house burger was very good and the fries (regular and sweet potato) weren't bad either.   They have a good selection of beers and had various flight tasting options, which was nice."}
{"text":"I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this bad experience was because they've only been open 2 weeks and I hope I'm right; it has potential. I arrived here with 3 friends on a Saturday night and the security asked us whether we wanted inside or out. We said out and he said it would be a while, even though we could clearly see tables right there on the patio. We said \"inside\" and walked into a (huge) nearly empty restaurant. We went to the back patio,where, surprise surprise, plenty of chairs and tables. And I mean plenty. We took a seat and a waitress came over right away. I have no complaints about the server herself, she was sweet and friendly. We started with drinks; 2 friends got beers which they liked, and myself and another friend got the blueberry lemonade, which neither of us cared for. It tasted like a fake blueberry syrup, my guess is that it was maybe Smirnoff blueberry vodka? Anyways, my boyfriend ordered a poutine right after his beer and it took 35 minutes. And it came without a fork when it did come. The waitress comped it for him because of the ridiculous wait. However, it was good. We also ordered another poutine about 10 minutes after my boyfriend had ordered his and it took just as long. That one was on the bill.   Lastly, the first time I went to the washroom there, a bunch of toilets were clogged and my stall had no toilet paper. The second time, there was throw up on the floor and in the sink and still clogged toilets. This place was NOT busy and to me, there's just no excuse to wait that long for a poutine and to see washrooms in that condition.   The place is beautiful and has a great location right on the water. I hope they can work out their kinks but I'll be honest, I'm skeptical to return."}
{"text":"Liked the selection on bears. Schnitzel was so tender and the Montreal meat sandwich was so yummy. Atmosphere live and filled with young people. View was nice. There were some fireworks visible from our table. Service was just fine. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was our first stop during our weekend trip to Toronto, and it kicked the trip off on an awesome note. Our group had poutine to split (when in Rome and all..), I ordered the \"kale & all his friends\" salad which was delicious and the rest of my group had burgers and wings. No one was disappointed! We each also opted for flights of beers in order to experience what the brewery has to offer. The Randler (similiar to shandy) was refreshing, and we were also fans of the 3 Speed and raspberry wheat. I enjoy lighter, crisper beers while my IPA loving husband raved about the Fracture and Boneshaker IPAs. After filling ourselves with food and brews, we took the free tour. While it is a smaller tour when compared to others (the Steamwhistle nextdoor for example), our tour guide Helder was knowledgeable and enthusiastic and we had a blast sampling even more of the beers that Amsterdam has to offer. Overall, it was an incredibly fun afternoon!! Just wish we could get some of these beers in the states!"}
{"text":"Ventured here on our first night in Toronto. Was a nice night so we decided it would be a good location down on the water. There is a back patio and some windows but I wouldn't say they play up their views.  My main issue with the BrewHouse was the timing. We ordered fairly quickly and only ordered a pretzel as an appetizer, a children's mac and cheese and two burgers. We asked for the mac and cheese and pretzel to come at the same time so placate our daughter. 45 minutes later (after constant assurances the food would be right out) we got the two burgers. 10 minutes after the burgers we finally got our pretzel (as dessert I guess?) and my daughter's meal. It took way too long and it came out in the wrong order.  Quality of the food was good. Burgers (for being cooked through to Ontario standards) tasted great. Pretzel was delicious and our daughter enjoyed her food. Drinks were cold and they had a great kid's cup (almost like a crayon).  Service was polite and attentive, however, despite the assurances food was coming right out it took close to an hour (while other tables sat after us got their food).  I might be back if I was in the area on a visit to Toronto, however, not sure I would go hunting it out in a city with so many choices."}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Try the honey siracha! Steph and Sean....best bartenders of all time."}
{"text":"We were here last night with a large group. The service was very slow. When the waitress finally came around she would say \"sorry, I had to catch up with my other tables\". At least we got an apology. I ordered the fish and chips, they were the worst I've ever had. The smokehouse burger arrived cold and everyone who ordered the veggie burgers gave it a thumbs down. On the upside, the beers were tasty and at great price!"}
{"text":"Great location, definitely a tourist trap but to be expected. Was there tonight and had a table on the upper deck overlooking the water. Food was ok, beer was meh and $$. We were a table of 4 and stayed for approx 3 hrs after work. Then things got weird. Our server came back 5 min after we ordered our next round and said \"I've served you 6 rounds and can't bring you any more drinks. Do you want some more food?\". Truth be told, only one person in our party had 6 drinks, the rest of us had 2-3 and we had all had appetizers and finished full meals just minutes before. Ok I know what you're thinking, that guy who had the 6 drinks was out of control and needed to go. Not the case. He's 6'2\" and 200+lbs ... he was in no way showing signs of intoxication and we were in no way causing a disturbance. In fact the patio was 3/4 empty at the time. Anyhow, we asked if there's some policy that requires her to stop serving a table after one of the patrons has had 6 drinks. She said \"no, it's a personal call\". Look, I've seen people cut off before for good reason but this was a joke. Maybe she just wanted to close out and go home, I dunno. Either way, we basically go kicked out for nothing after dropping nearly $300. That sucked and so did our server."}
{"text":"I attended this location last night for a friend's 30th birthday. We had reserved the upstairs because there were quite a few of us. Our first round of beers took about an hour to receive. The first issue was a miscommunication between servers and one thought the other was taking care of us, no big deal, these things happen.  After our order was finally received we waited an approx. additional 30 minutes before we saw any drinks. After the first round was received though, we didn't have to wait as long. Seems things just needed a bit of sorting out.  What did make the evening unpleasant was when the first server brought up the soft drinks and coffee before the beer. After handing my friend a coffee, he asked, \"So, when are the beers coming?\" We had been waiting a lonnnng time at this point. She did NOT appreciate this question and gave him such a nasty look without saying anything for several seconds. Finally, she said, \"They will get here when the bartender pours them.\" Eye roll. Another prolonged dirty look. This is probably the worst service I have had in recent memory from a server. Shockingly rude. If impatient customers offend you to this degree, you are probably in the wrong industry because you simply won't enjoy your job. As a former server, if you're not feeling it there, you should probably leave.  Surprisingly, all other servers that evening were attentive, friendly and polite, particularly the guy who was serving us all night.  The manager even came over at the beginning of the night to congratulate the birthday girl. But the rudeness of the female server was very disappointing and kicked off the night on a bad vibe. Thankfully, we didn't see her after that."}
{"text":"I would stay away.  We went with a group of 4 to watch Game 7 of Ducks vs. Kings.  After asking several times, we were officially told that they were not going to be putting on the hockey game on one of their 10+ televisions.  They could only have two events on and the Jays were playing and someone had requested an OHL game.   Was told \"this is not a sports bar we are not required to have that game on.\"    Service was generally slow and food was just fine.  The only plus would be the location and view but otherwise would list this as a stay away."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! We tried the oysters (they only have on weekends) and they actually made me an oyster fan. Both kinds were from PI and not gritty at all. Crab croquettes and pretzels with cheese dip were great too. Refreshing beer and fun atmosphere mad it a great first stop on our Toronto trip!"}
{"text":"These reviews don't lie, this place is not worth your time.  The BrewHouse itself is in a really great location on the water, and could be a fun spot to hang out.  I've been to the restaurant twice with friends.  Both visits were at night during the week, and featured progressively worse service.  On our first visit, the wings arrived cold.  On our second, the burgers were served 1 hour and 40 minutes after ordering, only half of it correct.  Leave this one for the tourists, there is much better to be had in Toronto.   PS: I too am confused about the waiting list when there are always empty tables to be seen."}
{"text":"Service was Our Server Amanda the Mermaid was the best !!! Ever..... Our food was cold they turned it to the kitchen... Then they brought out cold food again ... Twice .!!! The manager Mike came out this time took my plate back to the kitchen. Brought my plate back out hot and perfect!!! Made up for all the inconvenience of this dinner after a long day of sightseeing threw out Toronto... 5stars for Mike and Amanda ... Will give the restaurant one more try before we leave"}
{"text":"We were a group of four on Sept 30 for lunch. My wife asked for her fries well done and crispy. When the pale and limp fries arrived, she mentioned to the busboy, who made the delivery, that the fries did not look crispy. HE THEN REACHED INTO HER FRIES AND STARTED SQUEEZING THEM. WE WERE SHOCKED. To make matters worse, that busboy harassed us throughout our meal. I WROTE AN EMAIL A WEEK AGO to the Manager (the only business card available at the front) asking to discuss this. Then I sent a reminder. ZERO RESPONSE. I am not one to run to the review boards but this place is scary. I do not recommend going there. Food is below average, service is unlike anything I have ever seen. They don't want to call me back but the health inspector is welcome to reach out. Gross place, avoid. Nice building and location, if you don't mind creepy, rude and inappropriate people in your food."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing the same place as others, but I quite liked this place.   Service seems to be an issue with others, but our server was excellent and very friendly.   Foodwise, I've been twice and its been good! Schnitzel is nice and the steak frites is a solid hunk of steak. The pretzel is tasty and comes out nice and quick, which is key for an appetizer.   And finally, the space is well done. Good place to meet a bigger group of friends."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from some local beer enthusists. Upon arriving at the resturant, we were informed there would be roughly a 30 minutes, but we could leave a number and they would text us when there was a table available. We ended up doing that, which gave us some time to peruse the surrounding waterfront area.  When our seats were ready, we were greeted bt a friendly young waiter who informed us about the beer selection. They had a nice array of samplers ranging from light to hoppy, and the beers were all delicious.   Our food was brought out in a decent amount of time. I ordered the brisket burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and topped with a delicious aioli. The fries were a nice portion, not too much in comparison to the burger and they were just as awesome as everything else.   We finished it off by splitting some desserts. Our table ordered strawberry shortcake and chocolate torte. The shortcate was very light and tasty and the torte was dense, decadent and chocolatey (and flourless!)  Overall, it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"The Amsterdam BrewHouse just opened this Saturday and we decided to check it out as it was a rainy afternoon. Here's our first impressions of the place:  THE GOOD - nice layout and decor with mixed array of seating available for different party sizes, including an outdoor patio with bar/lounge - extensive food and drink selection - highlights: six brewed in-house craft beers, excellent poutine (fresh cut fries, not that salty, light gravy, big cheese kurds), plenty of tvs to catch the game  - friendly and attentive service from our waitress  THE BAD - disorganized and misinformed staff as inaccurate information was given out regarding seating, wait time and food availability. Eg. told that they were at full capacity and wait time was around 40 min but wasn't the case when we talked to the hostess and were seated within 3 min  THE UGLY - after finding out there were actually no seats at the bar, the bartender rudely told us that we could grab a beer and have it outside?!   Not sure if, 1) he realized that it was raining and 2) it was the waitress who had brought us to the bar to seat us in the first place. Again, there seemed to be miscommunication and disconnect between staff - did not like our beers and only finished half of it! - ordered the Kawartha Lakes Raspberry Wheat beer and one of the in-house brews called Fracture, an IPA. Found that the Raspberry Wheat beer did not taste sweet at all like Fruli, which was described to me by the waitress as being similar; it was bitter. The Fracture was a little bit too hoppy.  However, despite our mixed first impressions, we enjoyed the atmosphere and there seemed to be a good menu selection so perhaps we might re-visit to check out the beer tour and try something different."}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover, a tourist, or want to check out a cool restaurant Downtown; Amsterdam Brewhouse is the place to be.   The waiter described every beer that we ordered off the flight sample testing and was very personable.   I love that the menu is mostly if not all locally produced foods, I ordered the veggie burger and sweet potato fries, so tasty and filling. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and Brie pizza, delicious!!!   A great atmosphere to share with a group of friends, so bring along friends and relatives from out of town to get a taste of Toronto.   Prices are reasonable, no complaints!"}
{"text":"We waited for 50 minutes. The burger and fries quality was below average and pizza (little italy) was just ok... I also did not like the beers. To me it's not worth the long waiting time. Will not come back again"}
{"text":"Have wanted to come here for some time and had an afternoon free, so made our way over. Before sitting down to eat we went on the free \"brewery tour\" to find out more about the company and the beers that they brew. The staff member that took us on the tour was entertaining and informative.  We headed into the restaurant to have lunch following and were happy to sit near to the lake. The patio is under construction right now, so not as nice a view as it would be during other times through the year. We each chose one of the beer flights and enjoyed all of the beers! The food was fantastic, definitely the best food we have had while out in some time.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful! Great experience and we will plan to come back in the summer when we can sit outside and enjoy the lake."}
{"text":"Getting in this place is a nightmare and I still don't understand why. I was there with my boyfriend tonight and we just wanted a table for 2 on the patio.  On our way in, we walked by 4 empty patio tables so we didn't understand why the wait was out the door. When we got in near the host stand, there were about 6 other tables in my view alone that were empty as well.  People kept coming over to the host stand asking why it was taking so long and the host staff were SO RUDE. The one girl was throwing attitude at everyone and people kept asking her why she was seating people who just came in before people who had been waiting for over 40 mins.  Her excuse was \"oh, we tried to find you\"  This one man was livid and yelled back \"I've been standing 6 feet away from you for 40 minutes!\" She then miraculously found him a table. Go figure.   When we finally got to the host stand, we asked for a table for 2 and she said it would be an HOUR! For a table for two. The place is massive!  We were so fed up that we left, walking by a bunch of empty tables on our way out.  It's so bizarre to me that that they have tons if empty tables but they just watch customers walk out instead of filling them?  The only reason this place even got a 2 was because it's stunning! Beautiful location and gorgeous design.    I won't be back though. There are a million places in Toronto where you CAN get a table."}
{"text":"Was treated poorly by the wait staff and the food was not worth it. They see people only as dollar signs, tourist trap."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. I got the pizza since the fish tacos photos that I've seen online did not seem appetizing. The one thing that I do like is the environment. Its next to the lake so you can sit outside and view the lake if you want to. The building itself is huge too if you want to sit indoors. Would recommend for the scenery not much for the food. I dont drink beer so I cant comment on it. SErvice was also very good."}
{"text":"Look for something else! You have been warned!  Half the beers on the menu not available, service horrible, kitchen \"is running late\". After we waited one hour on the food we decided to leave and find a better dinner alternative."}
{"text":"I took the family here prior to a jays game . We arrived 2 1/2 hours prior to game time giving us plenty of time or so I thought. The service was the worst I ever received . It took 20 min to receive a menu.   We placed our order and waited over 1 hour no food. We asked our waitress to check on the food she never came back. Finally found a supervisor to help get our food . The fries where cold and the burger overcooked.  We will never come back !"}
{"text":"A group of us regularly gets together every few months to try catch up with each other and we take that chance to try out a new restaurant / bar. This time around someone suggested Amsterdam BrewHouse. What an absolute let-down.  First, the pros. (1) Stunning location: A  big patio along the waterfront is golden.  (2) Nice bar: the interior is beautiful and (3) there are plenty of tv's to watch sporting events and UFC fights. (4) The beer selection: lots to choose from!  Cons. (1) The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the Nut Brown Burger and it was tasteless. Two beef patties (which wasn't outlined on the menu and is too much food anyway), swiss cheese, grainy mustard, roasted mushrooms and NO FLAVOUR. How do you do that? I was not impressed and didn't each much of it. A $15 burger dish should at least match a fast food level of flavour (I was expecting more, but the bar has been lowered).   My friends ordered the following - Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken (verdict = meh, I've had better) // Margherita Pizza (verdict = meh, it's alright) // Shnitzel (verdict = it's okay) // Duck Grilled Cheese (verdict = pretty good) // Scotch Eggs (verdict = tastes ok, but made poorly). All in all, a pretty pricey choice for medicore offerings.  (2) The service is lacking. We weren't asked how we enjoyed our food at all. The server dropped off the food and picked up the plates when we were done. I also waited close to 10 minutes to get condiments for my burger, and COLD burgers make the bad burgers taste even worse. My friend ordered a flight so that he could try a bunch of beers he was curious about, and when it was brought out, the server notified him that they were out of 2 of the 4 beers, so they just swapped in whatever they wanted (which were two beers he already had). Not cool. Why not tell your customers that you're out before placing the order? When I let the server know that I wasn't happy with the food and that I'd like to speak to a manager about it, she offered me his card. Really? There's no one on site to speak with customers?  (3) The pricing. You're paying for the location, not the quality of food.  I much rather post positive reviews and urge you to go places where I've had a great time, so that you too can share in that experience. Unless you eat before-hand, I'd only go here for a beer or two to take in some sun along the waterfront. It would also be a great place to take someone from out of town that's into craft beers, but seriously, eat somewhere else first.   Thumbs and big toes down."}
{"text":"I came with a large group of friends for a combined birthday celebration. We booked the table in advance and jokingly made a special request for signs at the table for the birthday people. They obliged with a tastefully done sign that read \"Cheers! To the children of summer love\", which was a nice gesture.  The service was good and the food wasn't too bad overall. My friends liked the lemon chicken schnitzel and brisket cheeseburger. My order of pan-seared tuna sandwich was a bit of a disappointed because it was missing that quintessential crispy browned  surface. The food portions were also a bit on the small side, but with some appetizers and beer, one could get reasonably full.  Paying the bill as a group is always an issue. They put the 18% mandatory service charge on the bill, which is almost standard these days. However, they don't do split bills, nor can you pay the bill with more than two credit cards. This was a bit frustrating because why else then should I pay the mandatory service charge?  I was going to give 2 stars, but the location (right by the lake) and the signs from the special request warrants the third star. Come for the view, not for the food."}
{"text":"This place has some ups and some downs.  I love the location in the summer and my preference is to come for a beer and sit in one of those Muskoka chairs on the patio and watch the action on the lake.  The food is alright, nothing to write home about.  The service tends to leave a lot to be desired - slow to greet/take order, forgetting cutlery, never bringing napkins, not knowing the menu availability well (2 different servers mistakenly told me there were no oysters while I could see other tables getting oysters - I did get mine in the end and they were OK). This isn't a horrible place by any means, but there's nothing impressive about it."}
{"text":"Great location.  The space is beautiful but is completely overhyped.  We were a 2 top and waited for 15 min in line when there were visible spaces available on the front patio.  The security guard let us inside th restaurant where we had to line up again to see the hostess only to be seated at the very seat I had been staring at while waiting in the first line outside!  Beer is as good as to be expected. The food was quite disappointing, good concepts for creativity, failure on execution.  I ordered the Duck Grilled cheese with a side poutine made with their 416 gravy.  The food arrived and the poutine was cold and extremely bland. The 416 gravy was flavourless.  As for the duck grilled cheese, it too was extremely bland and dry.  it is rare that I do not finish a meal.  This was definitely left unfinished.  Overall, this place would be great for a pint on the patio. That's about it."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if the place was kids friendly before I went, but it actually was!! We were seated on the tall chairs so the kids wouldn't  be able get on and off the table easily, which was good. The pizza from the kids menu was tasty, not the pasta though. We two adults shared \"three amigo\" with beer, the dipping sauces were too spicy with not much flavour. I wish they could just have nachos instead. Overall experience was good, definitely gonna go back. Love the selection of beers. Like the interior design."}
{"text":"Hey Amsterdam Brewhouse... Stick to making beer, because you sure as hell don't know how to run a restaurant. Way too busy. It's utter chaos in this place. The food is sub-par compared to even the most boring chain restaurant (save yourself some time and money and go to Kelsey's or dare I say it... Denny's).   Final note... And I'm not making this up... We found a huge toenail in our gravy. MmmMm."}
{"text":"Bad service. Our waiter didn't come to check in on us. And when we asked the hostess for our check or to help find our server, she brushed us off and gruffly replied that she won't know who our server was and we should just wait."}
{"text":"I was here this evening, with about 6 other people. The service was not very good. The beer was delicious (as I expected it to be) however a few of their seasonals were not available, though I don't necessarily hold that against them. The food was mediocre.  I'll likely be back, but mostly for the beer."}
{"text":"Great experience here. The greeters and servers were all friendly and enjoyable to interact with. The beers were flavorful and exactly what we wanted. Would definitely go here again and recommend for anyone traveling in the Toronto area looking for a good brewery. I loved my Classic pizza, my boyfriend gave the Southwest Chicken pizza a 2/5."}
{"text":"They make a mean duck comfit poutine. I wasn't a fan of their beer selection though"}
{"text":"Warm place in a cold winter evening. Great selection of beers. Food was flavorful and satisfying"}
{"text":"Another great place for pub food that will probably never have no seats! This is my second time coming here. The first time was when it first opened and just revisited recently for a friend's birthday. Great experience both times and I personally think the food improved since the last time I ate here. Which is not usually the case for restaurants as I feel many just goes downhill as the time goes.  We started off with the pretzel (~$6) and yam fries (~$7). Both were salted which made it extremely tasty. The pretzel was very soft and came with two dipping sauces, one that was caramelly and the other was mustard. We also tried their beer flights and I'm a fan of this as I can sample a number of beers in one go. As for the main course, I had the salmon salad which was ok (~$15). Personally, I would have liked the salmon to be warm. A notable mention for the burger and ribs as they were both very juicy and came in very generous portions.   Service was alright, the server did seem a little pushy at times, but overall it was a great experience and would be back especially during the summer time for a drink at the patio!"}
{"text":"The food is good the only problem is that when I went I had to send my food back because I found out that they kept my meal under a heat lamp however it was right on the lake which was fantastic service was a little bit slow overall it was okay"}
{"text":"I've tried here twice and both experiences show this place needs improvement.  The pizza's and burgers are great, though the sweet potato fries are soggy.  The patio is excellent, and service once you have a table is good.   The downfall of this restaurant is that they cannot manage the large space.  The first time there my wife and I were told there was a six couples waiting list for a table for two for the patio.  Imagine our surprise when we walk outside (we were seated at the inside bar) and noticed they have an outdoor bar the hostess never mentioned and there were 15+ empty tables for four.  After talking to management  we were seated outside along with the other waiting couples.  Then this Friday I went with a group of co-workers.  We were made to wait inline only to be seated in a mainly empty restuarant.  I really like want to like this place, but they need to learn how to manage the space."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!  I have never seen anything like this....  What a joke.  My husband and I decided not only to give this place a second chance...but a third chance too and all I can say is...this place is the worst!  They've got one hostess seating their enormous line up of guests which means that in order to even get in and get a seat, you must wait 20-45 mins.  After your 20-45 minute wait you walk in to half empty, under staffed restaurant.  First of all - might they think that a number of hostesses may be required in an establishment as large as this one?  Why are all of the guests just standing in a line when the restaurant is EMPTY! Honestly...  The last time we were there we were with a large group for Sunday afternoon drinks and lunch.  My husband and I sat without a drink for 35 mins....  I had to ask our waitress for a glass of water 3 times.  Do you think she finally brought me a glass?  No.  Each time we have been, the food is staggered.  The first person at our table got their meal and then 30 minutes later the last person got their meal.  Not to mention that they forgot a meal or two along the way. After everyone received their meals we still hadn't even been given cutlery so that we can eat our meals...That turned out to be another hassel...  While half of our table was sitting there without drinks mid way through the afternoon, one of our family members got up and went to the bar to order a drink instead of from our waitress.  What did he find?  5 Waitresses standing there, playing on their cell phones....Yep, playing on their cell phones while we all sit there with empty glasses.  This place needs some serious help.  It is poorly managed to say the least and I would not recommend giving them a dime until they get their act together and learn how to operate properly and efficiently. There is no excuse for service like that in Toronto.  We gave them 3 chances...never again.   Oh and in regards to the food - it's not even good."}
{"text":"Nice location, pretty bad service ... Waited half an hour for a table, only to wait another half an hour to be acknowledge by the server... Killed my appetite"}
{"text":"This place gets a strong 3 stars. The atmosphere was wonderful and the food was great.   The hostess staff service were excellent and although there were long lines they handled the crowd well.   My server however was awful. Took us about 10 minutes to order 10 minutes for our drinks and she brought one of us the wrong thing.   We had ordered the yam fries and 40 minutes late and 5 follow ups they still had not came. The manager was kind enough to comp the fries for us but either the waitress was over worked or just awful.   I did like the experience but as other reviewers had said getting reasonable service is a challenge."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and snacks after skating at Harbourfront this weekend. Once inside, everyone in my party opted to order food with drinks. While the majority of the food was good to great, both the veggie burger (sent back - completely fell apart, rice based with zero flavour and on a bun ... who needs that many carbs in one dish!) and the crab cakes ($14 for 4 tiny crab cakes ... more filler than crab, over cooked and served with tomato sauce to keep them from rolling on the platter?) were underwhelming. Server was kind enough to refund the burger and replace it with another option.  Great venue, lots of seating options. Great beer on tap and lots of other options if beer isn't your thing + free tours (you can sign up in advance or if there happens to be one when you are there, you can join).   Will come again to take advantage of the amazing city / lake views but will choose food more wisely."}
{"text":"All in all, we loved the brewery - specious with wonderful lake views, nice staff.  The food was great too, which we didn't really expect.  We had lemon chicken schnitzel and a smoked half-chicken.  The schnitzel had a spicy kick to it and went really well with the beer.  The half chicken was smoked for about 8 hours and was amazing.  My husband never eats chicken skin, so this was the first time I see him make an exception.  We would definitely recommend both meals.  For beer, we ordered the flights so we could try.  The IPAs were a little too bitter bitter for my taste, but my husband liked them.  The reason I'm giving a 4 star is for the noise level.  We happened to visit when a basketball game was on.  The place was extremely loud - definitely more loud than an average sports bar.  It was a bit difficult to hold a conversation.  I will definitely go again, but this time hopefully not when a game is on."}
{"text":"I have been to Amsterdam about 4 or 5 times and have tried several items on the menu. The selection is not very large. The only thing I have really liked is the burger, everything else is simply okay. I would suggest coming for the beer and just having an app.  They are really busy in the summer so plan ahead before your visit to wait at least 30 minutes, 45 to an hour if you want patio. The patio is nice, but the service is very slow so do not plan on it being a quick bite to eat. Once they lost our place in line and the server simply said they were very busy so they make mistakes. They must hire a lot of seasonal employees which would result in hit or miss service. Because there aren't many great places to eat on queens quay I would recommend this place for the neighborhood, but not as a must stop in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food is awesome beer is awesome game always on! And pretty reasonable with the US Dollar to CD dollar discount....."}
{"text":"Good for groups Pricey for food Perfect if you plan to go for a walk on harbour front Beers had too much fruity taste for me. We ordered many"}
{"text":"Young and fun crowd out on the back patio! The atmosphere was beautiful and the staff was kind to us! Maggie was our server and treated us so well, we really enjoyed her service. The food was tasty, but the serving sizes were not huge. Enjoyed the few beers I tasted in the flight, especially the in house brew!"}
{"text":"Worse customer service from hostess Leigh   She was rude.  complained to management but I don't think they even care about their clientele based on his response   however Steve was a great waiter"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews for the Amsterdam BrewHouse. I do agree that the staff could be better trained, and things can seem chaotic at times, but I'd expect that for a place that just opened its doors.  Pros - their beers are fantastic, and I love doing the tasting flights - I found the food quality to be good (albeit a bit overpriced for what you get) - fantastic atmosphere and great patio  Cons - there have been some nice servers there, but they are not well trained (yet) - at times its a bit chaotic and line ups can pile up behind a host who doesn't seem to know whats going on  I'm sure they will work out the \"new restaurant kinks\", but even still, I love going there and I love the beer."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place from what others have said. But I think the view and patio must be blinding the positive reviews.   We arrived as a group of 11 to a mostly empty front patio. There were others sitting so we rearranged a couple tables to fit our group and were told it was closed. Only later did we realize it was only closed because the server wanted to go home early.   Inside we saw a great spacious and mostly empty place. We were told the back patio didn't have space for us and they used their touch screen computer to try and find us a place. We all looked at each other and chuckled since it was quite obvious there was plenty of space for us. Instead of giving us a nice booth they assembled a table under a dripping set of overhead pipes. By now we were more annoyed by the service so we said nothing of the dripping.   We were then told that as a large group we would be charged mandatory gratuity of 18% and that we could not have separate bills. So we're paying an automatic service charge for less service. Nice. Three of our group were so frustrated by this, they left the table and headed for the bar.   It comes time to order and probably 30%+ of what we wanted to order was not available. On a Saturday night. Did they not expect any customers for the weekend? Cheesecake - sorry, not available. Signature beer - sorry not available. Sampler of beer - sorry two not available of the four in the pre-defined sampler.   Thankfully the beer at least was good. The waitress must have realized by the end that we did not have a terribly good experience and only stayed for one beer, so she split our bills anyway.   Although I'm sure I will end up here again to have a drink on the patio, it won't be my choice. I look forward to some real competition in the area."}
{"text":"Hello Amsterdam team!  My sister-in-law booked a table for ten people last Saturday, April 18th at 8:15 pm. All the visitors except me and my partner live very far from downtown but they decided to come all the way to see us (we live across the street from Amsterdam).  We arrived at 8:15 sharp and the hostess took us to our table that was happily occupied by another group of people without any reservations.   We had to wait over 45 minutes to get another table. We just stood there and waited and kept getting \"Apologies, just a few more moments.\" When we finally got the table, which was still filthy from the previous guests. A couple of waitresses came to clear and wipe some parts of the table but not the one in front of me. I said to the waitress, \"Can you please wipe the table?\" She said, \"I already did\", even though there was clearly an empty can of beer from the previous guests right in front of my face. Another waitress came and kind of cleaned about 25% of the table but, again, not the beer can in front of me.   What else should I say? That the service was unacceptably slow and my evening was spoiled? That I already told this story to pretty much everybody I saw over the last week and I met a lot of people?   If we didn't have 8 people with us, my boyfriend and I would just had walked to another one of dozens of drinking places at Harbourfront.   We were your faithful clients but clearly those times are over.  You made multiple mistakes over the course of one evening and what did we get? You are sorry. Wow! How about 20% off the bill? How about a couple of free drinks for everyone?   I am also sorry. I will avoid Amsterdam as much as possible and encourage everybody I know to do the same.   A well-managed place is the one that is well-managed when there is a line at the entrance. This is Harbourfront guys, not suburbs. If you can't manage the tourist volumes, move somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had 40 minutes to get to the Jays game. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. Great beer!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the bad reviews fool you. We had great food, great service and awesome beer. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  The wait time was 30-45 minutes at the main entrance.  We went to the side entrance and were seated within 15 minutes.  Our waitress was very pleasant and took orders from us quickly and was very attentive.  2 out of 4 of the flight options weren't available due to some beers not being available.  That wasn't a big deal to me but now reading through some of the comments I can see this happens regularly.  Hubby and I ordered 2 different flights of beer which I really enjoyed.  Then we ordered sweet potato fries for an app and they were really good.   For dinner we ordered the salmon salad and beef ribs.  I enjoyed my food but I had expected the salmon and boiled potatoes to be hot on top of the salad.  Everything was cold which was a bit disapponting.  The salad dressing was the only thing with flavour.  The beans salmon and potatoes had no seasoning.   My hubby's beef was delicious but there was barely any rice to accompany it.  For $26 I would have expected a bit more food on the plate to eat.  Overall the atmosphere was beautiful and I would probably go back.  Might go for apps and beer instead of dinner though."}
{"text":"Venue is large, beer choice is excellent (it's a brewery after all), the bar has a nice shape.   Always a good spot in a really nice location with patio on the lake (almost...)."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try this place for a while, but I was so let down!   The beer selection is good and (in addition to the stellar location) probably the only redeeming quality of this restaurant. However, the food is incredibly mediocre and overpriced at that. Among the few underwhelming menu items selected, the wood oven pizza was by far the most disappointing...being embarrassingly undercooked.   The service was also very meh. Everything felt very rushed and sloppy. Side plates and cutlery were forgotten several times, bussing was slow, our server fell off the face of the earth, and for some reason our server could not manage to find a place to charge a phone. But what I don't understand is that there seemed to be so many servers just standing around socializing together rather than actually taking care of patrons. I am all for having fun while you work, but not at the expense of the service that guests are essentially paying for!   And lastly the kicker: Upon finishing our food, with a round of beers still untouched, our server (without asking us if we would be ordering anything else) requested we settle the bill at our table and move to the bar if we plan to continue ordering only drinks. I understand that to some people this may seem like a reasonable request, but it really isn't. It's restaurant-talk for \"GTFO we have a long wait-list and you've overstayed your welcome, campers\".  The exchange felt very awkward and unwelcoming. Basic hospitality etiquette would be to offer us a free round in exchange for freeing up a table for their wait-list...especially since we ordered tons of food and alcohol. So instead of putting in any more orders, we banged back our drinks and quickly vacated the table to make way for another group of suckers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST EXPERIENCE I have EVER had at a restaurant!!!   I had gone to the restaurant part of the brewery with 8 other friends and from start to finish was a complete disaster. We had to wait forever to even get into the building, they didn't even call us when our table was ready, we had to go up and ask. Finally we got seated at least 30 minutes waiting for a table (when more then half the restaurant was not full)  When we got to our table, we had no service! We had to ask for menu's, waters and ask for a server. Finally we ended up getting service but on behalf of the manager who barely could get us drinks and things in order. After waiting 2 hours, we finally started to get our food. Some of my friends didn't get their orders correct. Some other friends didn't even get their food at all including me.   When we had complained about how bad the service was, the managers were rude and not willing to do much for us in order to make us happy. After about 3-3.5 hours in the restaurant on everything going wrong, they were rude to finally offer us a discount on our meal.   I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. My group and I were not the only people in the place that were unhappy. There were multiple tables around us that were complaining about many things as well. Being in the service industry myself, I would expect more for an establishment.  Completely unhappy and ruined our well planned out evening to reconnect with friends.  Please do yourself a favour and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Terrible reception :( the lady at host desk was so impolite and unwelcoming.  The place is also so loud, my friends and I had a hard time hearing each others."}
{"text":"I just went here two days ago for the first time and it was FANTASTIC! I'm not necessarily a die hard Amsterdam fan or anything but this was such a fabulous location!  There are two out door patios, one of which overlooks the water (Beautiful!) The line up was long so we opted to sit inside and I'm actually very glad we did! We may not have had as much of a chance to check out the awesome interior, otherwise. Very spacious and clean.  SERVICE: Our server was SUPER nice and didn't mind playing along with some very bizarre questions from our party. What a great sport!!! You don't always find such friendly staff as her. Our table was checked on frequently, given everything we needed (I asked for mustard and she brought me a bottle of it. Way to work your way into my heart!!).  I quite enjoyed my experience there, and I will definitely be back with others."}
{"text":"Beer = great  Inside = great  Patio = great  The food and service at this place are outright horrible though. Grade school interns could do better. Things with buns or tacos seem to always be stale. Beer takes 20 minutes to come, often no head left by the time it arrives.  Food whether it's an appetizer or main doesn't matter, will be over an hour. I've been there when it's packed and when it's empty and it was the same thing. I'm pretty easy going and not hard to please (specially when on a sunny waterside patio sipping beer) but this place just can't perform very simple pub tasks.   I'm going for 1 star just because they're messing up on such simple things. It's not hard making burgers and bringing them to a table but they just can't do it. I hope management wakes up and fixes this because the place has TONS of potential and Harbourfront has needed a pub/patio"}
{"text":"Kids going back to school, not enough staff... Slow service. Great location but managment doesn't know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really nice location be the water. Got their at 7is on tues evening and it was already busy. Originally wanted to sit on the long patio by the water but decided the line was too long so sat at the front patio.  Waitress was very helpful with beer choice and the two I tried I liked very much  We ordered the fish tacos from the appetizer menu and the brisket sandwich.  According to my partner the tacos were \"o.k.\"  but the brisket sandwich was not good - it was ridiculously sweet; shredded with a bbc sauce. So much so I only ate half (and they really are not that huge ) Came with some kettle chips that tasted drowned in beef fat ( some weren't even crisp ) although I will admit that once I stared dunking them in siracha hot sauce they tasted way better!!  The place inside is enormous so, although our server was pretty good, overall the service is slow.   So the 3 stars are for the beer, location and atmosphere.  I would steer clear of the food."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went for dinner after work with some coworkers. Sat on the patio, waited twenty minutes to get more than one menu. She snapped at my pregnant boss that just wanted to get a hot chocolate. It got cold so we wanted to move inside. It wasn't that busy, but our waitress told us to settle up with her and go wait at the hostess podium... with our drinks.   She also fucked up our bill and tried to charge us twice for a drink we thought. When we had the floor manager look into it he said 'he didn't know how much we had been drinking already'. I was pretty insulted as we had just gotten off of work and were obviously not intoxicated. He was a bully and just generally a prick.  All in all, pretty much the worst pub experience I have ever had. I wouldn't recommend this place. Which sucks, because I love Amsterdam beer."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to eat in Toronto! The wait staff were awesome, the beers and drinks came quick, refills for sodas were automatic, the food was delicious (we ordered the poutine, Swiss mushroom burger with Caesar salad, seared tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries, and kids chicken tenders and fries)and the price was spot on/ not to mention the great view of the harbour!"}
{"text":"i usually am not down for going to touristy places, but my friend and i decided to go for it, and enjoy sitting in a reasonably priced restaurant on the lake during the first day of our trip to toronto, as we were staying very nearby.  the service was kind of slow, and they acknowledged that they were short-staffed.  still, i didn't appreciate that my chicken and brie pizza arrived cold.  it was not bad though, and i don't mind cold pizza ... i can't remember what my friend had, but suffice it to say that the food was nothing special but satisfying at the same time.  it was my first time having some kind of beer sampler - i can't even remember the lingo that was used, because i never heard it before - which was nice, although many of them arrived warm (or warmish), and although i like beer, i prefer it ice-cold.  don't go out of your way to visit this place but don't avoid it either, if you're in the neighborhood looking for a spot to relax a bit and eat a bite."}
{"text":"Waiting list system doesn't work. I waited for 15 minutes. I got the text message saying that my table was ready. And then, when I came into the restaurant they mentioned it was a mistake. That somebody took the table. And I had to wait again... 15-20 minutes more."}
{"text":"Waited an hour to get service  here once seated in dining area. Got up and left. There was no acknowledgement or apologies from staff either."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with family and friends and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed. If you've tried Boneshaker or Amsterdam Blonde while out in the city or from the BEER store and LCBO you know your in for a treat if you try one of the other craft beers. They have an option for \"Beer-in-a-bag, with a shot of Jack\" Do it. It's fun.   The thing I like best about the menu is that it's one page. I hate being overloaded with too many items to choose from. The food is worth the visit as well-last time I went the entire table ordered the same thing. It was a burger made with brisket. I've tried other items as well and they were all pretty tasty. Portion sizes are pretty spot on, I've never left too full or wanting more.   The ambiance is my fav part. They have 3 bars to sit by, lots of dinner seating on 2 floors and the restaurant sits right on the water. You can watch boats pass by and planes taking off and landing...I happen to love sitting on the wrap around patio to watch the flights go in and out. Last but not least they have a store attached where you can purchase the beer they make on location if you decide to take the party home after dinner. All in all I will go back again, even if just for another Beer-in-a-bag.   I'm giving 5 stars based on service, location, ambiance and of course the beer."}
{"text":"That was a bust. Sat at our table for 22 minutes without acknowledgement after being seated. Other waitress wouldn't help us, said she would find our server, but didn't. We just left. Complained to the manager on the way out. Shoeless Joe's next door thanks you for your pitiful service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome beers. Can never go wrong with a beautiful view of the lake either. Service seems to be worse each time I visit. But the amazing food and beers keep me coming back for more. Awesome before a blue Jays game. But can be very busy also so com"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I do live close by so I have came here a couple times with friends . Food is really good (pizza and the lemon chicken schtiznel )  if you go to the restaurant during the week... it seems that Saturday Sundays are the busiest we have been twice Sunday during the day and waited over an hour for our food ! But I must say the food is really good ! Service is good we had a girl named Michelle? Or Melissa last Sunday she was very knowledgable and gave us some samples of beer to try before we made a decision also we went once and sat at the bar and the bartender with a long beard is amazing he knows so much about the beer it's pretty cool!  Boneshaker IPA is my favourite and they always have fun adventure beers to try ! Overall this place is good you just have to realize when you go to a beautiful restaurant right on the water when it's 25 and sunny outside your going to have to wait your turn and wait a bit for your service ! But other then that it's a great atmosphere !"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. It's an amazing space inside and the patio is right on the lake. The beer is great too. When I couldn't make up my mind over what to order, they offered a sample which is a really nice touch. Unfortunately the service got very spotty after that (maybe it got busier?) and I ended up not getting my drink for about half an hour. Our server was MIA so I found the manager and he sent it over for free. Upon leaving, the server not only still charged me for it but marked it down as a more expensive beer. Yikes! However, I still came out with a great impression of the place and am writing my service experience as a one-off. Definitely recommended for the view and for how delicious their Boneshaker beer is."}
{"text":"Average pub/ale house that had decent food but nothing spectacular. Probably wouldn't come here more than once. It seemed popular because of the location on the harbor. We tried 2 beer flights and didn't love any of the 6 different beers we tried. The buffalo cauliflower bites, mac & cheese croquets were good! The chicken wings came in different levels of spiciness, and the waitress told us that the \"ghost pepper suicide\" was ranked 2nd to \"honey sriracha\" in spiciness-- so don't let the names fool you. Tried the honey sriracha and it wasn't very spicy."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It took 45mins of being ignored when finally I had to approach a server myself to ask if we could order some food."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with friends last week on the patio! Lovely views! The food was great but the service was even better! I didn't catch her name but she had a lovely Irish accent, I think her name was Shawna. Will be back again definitely!"}
{"text":"What an amazing location on the waterfront with prime views of Lake Ontario. Plus the wraparound patio is absolutely amazing on sunny and warm days if you can manage a table.  Definitely a good spot for people watching by the Harbourfront and seeing all the beautiful ships and boats sailing by.  Amsterdam beers are brewed onsite and they have quite a good selection to suit all taste buds from light to dark, crisp to bitter, plus they having tasting flights so you can sample a variety of beers if you cannot decide on just any one beer.  Flights are a great way to sample the ample selections of beers that Amsterdam has to offer.  I dare you to test your beerbuds and try all the beer flights.  The menu is varied and food selections will satisfy any palates.  I've been here on numerous occasions and rarely  left disappointed with quality, portion or taste of the food.  I think I may have tried most items on the menu to comfortably say the food is pretty tasty and I never left feeling hungry, plus with reasonable prices that won't damage the wallet too much.  Service has always been friendly and I never had an issue with the staff.  There may have been times when service was a little slow, but considering how busy the place can get, it was always reasonable timing and they would always acknowledge their delays as necessary.  I was recently here for an event and the staff handled our group with friendly service, professionalism and always with a smile.  From the hostesses to the servers and bartenders, it really is great service and good hospitality.  I'm definitely a happy customer and cannot wait for patio season!"}
{"text":"This place is way too big and feels very empty when not busy. It was cold, they must be trying to save money on heating bills when not busy? The waitress forgot about us 3 times.... Food Sucked, beer was great. It was the winter so I couldn't check out the patio which I heard is great. Cheers."}
{"text":"Drink/Food - 3 stars  Great beer selection when they're not out of what you want (previous reviewers were bang on about the flight substitutions) and an OK menu featuring nouveau pub food whose execution is inconsistant. I wish the menu were smaller and focused on doing a few things very well than a large menu that does a lot of things just so-so.  Venue/ Location - 4 stars  Beautiful space. Patio can't be beat. Beer shop on-site as at Mill Street.  Service/ management - 2 stars  After four trips to Amsterdam over the course of the 9 months they've been open, I remain unimpressed by the service and management of the restaurant and bar. The issues other reviewers pointed out months ago continue to plague it now.   On my most recent trip, we were a party of 8 on a weekend and it took close to 2 hours to get seated, then another hour to get our food. A longer wait is of course expected for a large party, but the restaurant was not full, and I saw several large tables sitting free for the duration of our visit. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Food was nice, decent service and very nice beer! I wish it was not raining and we could have used the lake front patio. The location would have been ideal but even the interior design was quite nice."}
{"text":"Fries were kind of cold and food was alright. But if you are looking for a good beer, Amsterdam has you covered."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly after they opened on Sunday morning. We were seated near the fireplace with a view of the lake.  Brisket sandwich was great with poutine.  We will definitely be back to this eatery next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here before a blue jays game on Canada day expecting we would not be able to get in but we were seated right away outside. Nice outdoor patio with nice view of the lake. Originally came here for the beer but decided to grab some food before the game. Got a flight to try some different beers and the waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful. Beers were good but nothing stood out in my mind. For food, my boyfriend and I split the  the southwest chicken pizza and fish tacos. VERY happy with the food. Fish tacos were the best I've ever had with the perfect amount of toppings on each taco. Pizza was a good size (bigger than a personal pizza, about the size of a large dinner plate) with the best BBQ sauce. Waitress was nice and friendly even though we are Red Sox fans :) Overall, very happy with the food and service."}
{"text":"This place seemed perfect. I came with a group of seven, the hostess agreed to play the playoff MLB game we asked if they would show. They had over 20 TVs all playing the same thing. We ordered, the food was great, then before we got our food they changed the channel. We asked if they would change it back, but they told us that \"they couldn't play big games or too many people would show up.\" We asked a few more times if they could change it back, but after no response we decided to take out business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mercedes was the best server we had in a while. Even did the thriller dance for us. Service was amazing overall and the drinks were great"}
{"text":"Terrible experience after the Blue Jays game on Sep 10. Our group of 6 stood in line for an outside table for over an hour. The seating staff were totally confused and incompetent. They use a manual system to track where you are in line. They couldn't keep track of the groups on the list or explain the decisions they made. Many tables sat open while the staff debated about what to do. Management should clean house on the staff as they are losing significant revenue due to their incompetence. Our group eventually walked away due to how we were communicated with. Worst experience I have ever had waiting in a line at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited 3 hours for a table for a special evening with friends (was told our wait would be half an hour), once we got our table service was awful. Took another half hour to get drinks. They kept saying they were very busy but there were open tables everywhere and they were seating groups of two at tables meant for six. No apologies on the long wait either for the table or for our orders. Ruined what was supposed to be a fun celebration."}
{"text":"We stopped here after driving for 4 hours from Michigan! We all came very hungry and ready for a drink! Waitress was a slow but accommodating with a 8 person table. She had some recommendations for food which we took her up on. The pretzel dip was bland, the actual dip was not very tasty but came with different breads and crackers. We got the poutine which I would definitely recommend. We ordered pizza and it was okay nothing special. What we got frustrated about what the drinks were diluted. Several of us got gin and sodas and has to ask for another shot or two to be poured, which took 20-30   It is a cool restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Didn't love the food or the service. Probably will not go back again."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as we stand on the curb outside Amsterdam Brewery looking for another bar. Our party of 6 arrived at 5:30 pm to get a spot on the patio. Granted it is Friday. Over the course of an hour, we watched dozens of groups around our size stroll on in. At 6:30, the hosts told us that they could seat us at two separate tables that were back-to-back. And no, they said, we would not be able to move the tables or chairs. They half-heartedly tried to sell us on the tables by saying nothing else would become available for a while.  My friend had a voucher from the manager because the last time he ate here, his burger was dry, stale, and had lettuce outside of the bun. Judging by the attitude here, that level of service is the norm.  I blame this experience on ourselves. It was our mistake for coming here for a waterfront patio  instead of going to Against The Grain in the first place."}
{"text":"The help seemed a little confused when we got there... with the line in front, and with the seating. Finally, we sat down. The dishes on the table were dirty. The beer I ordered came to me with lipstick already on the glass (gross). The meal was pretty good and the waitress was nice, but we waited a long time for the waters we ordered...... because they said they didn't have enough glasses!!!! And the bathrooms were dirty, too."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but only popular because of its location and decor. If you're looking for great service this is not the place for you. Have been several times, food is good but always takes forever, open kitchen concept is nice but not effective when seeing the staff fight.  Tried the restaurant again today at around 6pm only to be highly disappointed from the staff again. Hostess was too busy on the phone to even acknowledge us. Waited a true 5 minutes before another staff member came over to seat us. Once seated, waited 15 minutes before We stopped one of the numerous staff members to see if we could order. Highly disappointed in the service - the restaurant wasn't busy, highly staffed and everyone is too busy talking with other staff members to even pay attention to the guest coming through the door. Recommendation for management - your staff is not ready for the upcoming season.  Anyone interested in going to this restaurant - I highly recommend only going for drinks, disregarding the hostess and only sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"First and foremost - the service is HORRIBLE. In an area where you need to excel at providing a great customer experience this place falls flat on its face. I've been several times over the summer since they first opened and let me tell you they actually find it acceptable that their food takes over an hour to come out (even though we're talking about mediocre pub food and not gourmet dishes). They will literally tell you this sometimes at the door. Their management could care less that you've been waiting 45 minutes just to get your first drink order in. Simply unacceptable. Granted they're new to this and I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt after the first few weeks of opening but 3 months later and about 5 separate visits and they still can't figure out how to get food out on time or drinks for that matter.  In addition to the food fiasco is the fact that they consistently seem to be out of the majority of beers on their menu. Keep in mind that their beer selection is almost only AMSTERDAM beers. You know...the brewery that this place is actually a part of? Couldn't make this up if I tried people.  Don't even waste your time complaining to their management because all they'll tell you is there's nothing they can do about the slow service and the state of complete confusion their staff to be constantly in. Really? That's the best you can do? After waiting nearly an hour for your servers to figure out who's section it is? How about telling us you'll fix the problem, buy as a round of drinks and get us some service that's deserving of the tips that your staff seem to think they're entitled to.  The patio is a joke. For some reason they've decided to employ utterly useless bouncers to stand around to try and make this place look important. How about you take that money and hire some staff that can get the food cooking in under an hour and serve tables promptly? I can't count how many people I've watched up and leave in disgust after waiting forever just to get some service!  It's a shame because as a local resident we're all hoping for some good local bar/restaurants to come into the area but ones that actually care about repeat business and don't assume everyone's a one-time tourist. You'll soon find you need to rely on the locals come the cold, long winters where the patio and tourists won't exactly be bustling."}
{"text":"This place is a very large with a fun atmosphere. I visited while in Toronto for business on a cold, snowy Tuesday night in January. The bartender, Alex (Alexandria), greeted me with a warm, friendly smile. She easily answered my questions about the beer and steered my towards a very nice IPA. The food menu provides plenty of choices and should please everyone. I selected the Smoked Ribs and I was very satisfied. The meat fell of the bone and the smoky taste was just enough to satisfy.   During my meal, Alex continued to check on me to make sure my food and beer were good, again, with a genuine smile and brief conversation. When it was time for another beer, Alex let me taste of few other options which were were all very good.    I will definitely stop in here again on my next trip to Toronto. It has a great combination of friendly and efficient staff, great food and excellent location. You can't go wrong. Thanks to Alex and her co-worker Mary for making me a fan! I hope I can come back in the summer."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Amsterdam for a hot minute because 1. I love me some AMS and 2. because I had one of their beers at another watering hole and LOVED it.  coupla things- They do not appear to carry all of their beers...this is just odd so Im assuming I missed something...would have helped if our server was actually present...(ill get to that..). The Amsterdam brew house actually has 2 locations which lead me to believe that they started at this smaller location, blew the eff up, and opened the bigger location where they now brew their beer. I could be wrong but Im usually not.  The food is excellent.  The service iS HORRENDOUS.  This is actually a theme in the breweries here as we had a similar experience at Mill St. as well. She started off ok...but then she straight up disappeared. For entirely too long. And when we asked other people (2 in fact) where she was or if they could just give us our bill, we were completely let down as both (why we had to ask 2..) completely dropped the ball!!!   When our server finally showed herself again she came to our table to tell us 'Im so sorry this is the worst day ever'    This is where the server/patron line HAS to be drawn. Listen, as a 32 yr. old woman myself, I know shit happens and I do absolutely care about others, however, when Im trying to enjoy lunch with my friends I kind of just need you to do your job. You need to be professional and go tell that sob story to your boss, and see if they can cover you. You don't get sympathy from the 4 people that just spent $100 and have been trying to find you so they can leave for 45 minutes.  the food was excellent and we want to return which the ONLY reason we didn't just ditch the bill. Thats how bad it was."}
{"text":"I know I am writing this review in January, but my memory of this place is still fresh!  One summer day I finished work early on a Friday and my train was only coming at 4PM - had something like 3 hours to burn, so decided to walk here and have a couple of beers before I head back home.   The day was indeed perfect for a beer outside. 25C, pleasant breeze, not a cloud in the sky. The patio was L shaped with a side perpendicular to the lake and the other one facing it. The only thing between the patio and the lake is the actual harbourfront walkway - hence you are basically by the water. This is arguably one of the few places in the city where u can sit, have a beer and have an obstructed view of the lake. They had setup muskoka style chairs with nice umbrellas right on the patio facing the lake. It was incredible. Spent several hours there enjoying the nice view of the lake and the breeze. And a couple of beers. Amsterdam is one of the more reputable Toronto breweries and their stuff is good. Perfect way to complete a beautiful afternoon.  Did not eat hence cannot comment, but their menu was traditional with burgers, wraps, fish and chips etc. Most of the people that were eating around me seemed to fully enjoy it.   Love the place, will make it a tradition to go back there at least once every summer."}
{"text":"Love, love, love it here!  I've been here a few times. Disclaimer: I am not much of a beer drinker, so this is an amateur review!  +Lovely view of the lake +Good service all times that I have been here +I like the vibe in general! ~Always really busy, but have never waited ages to get seated + I am NOT a beer drinker, and I found two beers that I liked! + All the food I have eaten has been AWESOME! Pretzel bites- yes. I had an amazing pizza there before as well.   Try the sampler if you aren't sure what to get, beer-wise!"}
{"text":"A really nice venue. Beautiful building and interior set up. I had the schnitzel which was excellent. My son had fish and chips which was also excellent. The beer was great too. There are 2 reasons why I couldn't give it a '5' this time: 1. There is NO change table in the men's washroom. It's 2016 for crying out loud! and in my mind, that is unacceptable.  2. I wanted to buy beer at the store after our meal but there best and local brew, the 416, was not available for purchase."}
{"text":"This place has great location(obviously) and few okay beers, the rest is just bad. I've been here once when it first opened and second time just a week ago. The first time was alright, I ordered lamb and it did taste okay but it was small and overpriced.  The second time I ordered fish and chips, replaced chips with a salad. The fish was literally tasteless, I tasted nothing! Now, the salad that i ordered, came in a TINY bowl, probably small enough to only fit an apple or even smaller. Yes, without exaggeration, the salad was that tiny...two bites at most. It was soaked in balsamic vinegar, i thought there was more vinegar in the salad than lettuce. Here's the best part: I also had to pay $2 EXTRA to get it instead of fries! My boyfriend got the fish with fries in that same miniature bowl. All this took about 30 min to arrive to our table and 30 min after we were done to get the plates out of the way and to pay. Overall, I think its an okay place and would probably give you a better experience if you go on a weekday when it's not as busy and for the beer only!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not much of a beer connoisseur but felt that this restaurant offers a solid variety of international and draft beers at affordable prices.   The food was generously portioned and pretty standard. Nothing too special. They offer standard bar food like fish and chips, pizza, poutine, burgers and sandwiches.   The main attraction of this restaurant is its location, view and patio. The restaurant is situated right beside Harbourfront Centre, Ann Tindal Park and faces Lake Ontario. Its spacious patio is a great place to take in the beautiful lake view and breeze and enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"Beers were good and food was good, nothing really special. The feel was more commercialized, but I still enjoyed stopping in for a visit."}
{"text":"Good beer, nice view, but horrible service (and this is something I personally value).   Our waitress literally refused to move our table from the patio to inside the restaurant, despite several tables being available. It was extremely windy to the point that one of our beers fell down, but she still refused. I have no idea why...but my guess is that she would then have to share her tip with the other waitress. Looking back she probably should have accepted a smaller piece of a bigger pie!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give this place more stars!   Beer selection was incredible and love the location.. the food was also amazing! Try the beef dip sandwich if you go there its so good!   Definitely planning on coming back alot this summer! :)"}
{"text":"Sucks ! Very poor management ! Completely unprofessional ! Had to wait for 20 min while the restaurant was empty ! Don't know how long they will continue with this attitude ! Stay away !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some beers as I had already eaten dinner.  First off, if you had ever been to the restaurant that was previously here you would know how much of an improvement (at the very least, in decor) the Amsterdam Brewhouse is.    I arrived with a friend around 7pm on a Saturday evening and the place was abuzz.  We were told there would be a 20-30min wait for dinner but we were only grabbing drinks so were invited to seat ourselves at the bar.  There is one bar by the entrance and another in the middle of the restaurant by the kitchen.   I can't comment on the quality of the food but I seriously think it would be significantly better than the old restaurant that was here...the food was disgusting lol.  I ordered the Richmond & John flight tour to start which is a sample of their lighter beers.  Service was very friendly and I loved the atmosphere.  Good for groups, dates, or just stopping in for a pint.  You can make resos online which I would recommend if you plan to dine here on a weekend.  This is a great addition to the waterfront resto selection and I can't wait to come back and enjoy some beers on the patio once the weather warms up."}
{"text":"I'm so torn on this place. On one hand the location is great, with a huge dining room and a fantastic patio in the back, and they serve their namesake brewery's beer which is really good. On the other, the service is atrocious and the food is really hit or miss depending on what you order. I would generally stay away from the starters but some of the mains are alright.   Unfortunately, this still probably makes it the best place to go if you want to sit on a patio right on the lake. It seems restaurants in Toronto see the lake view as a substitute for good service."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer! Enjoyed the view, staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Right on the water this brewhouse has incredible scenery along with a very unique decor to draw in tons of people. However, the let downs of this brewery were one after another. For a place that brews it's own beer in house and sets the menus they were out of nearly half there own branded beers. As well, the waitstaff was absolutely horrendous, they had no sense of time and left us waiting and wondering on countless occasions. This quick lunch we had planned took a hard turn to a two and a half hour affair due our MIA waitress."}
{"text":"Seemed like the waiters and waitresses here made a conscious effort to not make eye contact with a single table as they walked by. Multiple servers would walk down the aisles without even attempting to look anywhere but straight forward. I had a fish dish, the serving size was tiny, and the fish tasted very bland with little flavouring. My friend had the tacos, the whole dish probably had less than an ounce of meat. In summary, the service was utter garbage and the food was not remotely close to being good enough to make up for even 20% of the terrible service. This place is plain BAD."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at reasonable prices, great view of the lake and servers were attentive.  A must to go in the summer. Reservations are highly recommended.  Try the pretzel and the Brussels sprouts delish! Burgers are amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, with every intention of visiting again and again. Was the service a tad slow on this particular visit? Yes. But to our servers credit, she was very upfront about it because they were extremely busy. If you go and you see a lineup at the patio, don't be fooled - they move through their wait pretty quickly. Kudos to the management who also acknowledged that our food was taking awhile to arrive and comped our dinners."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars except the wait staff isn't familiar with the menu.  We asked some questions about a few dishes and our waitress couldn't answer confidently. Great location, nice patio, good vibe, great food, amazing beer.  Sausage pizza was awesome.  I loved that the kids meals were actually large enough for my 11 year-old son. Lately we've been ordering for him off the main menu cuz servings are small, but not here! Dinner, drink, & ice cream for $8 and he was happy."}
{"text":"I went here on a sunny day and the line up to get in was insane! We had to wait more than one hour in a huge line up outside the door.  However, once we got in, the waitress was very friendly and tried her best to work as quickly as possible (it's super busy)  Good food/drinks and decent prices!  will def come again :) ALSO: for some reason YELP states that it closes at 10, but its actually open much later than that"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Service was great and good was good. Smokehouse burger was out of this world along with the ciders they have (not a beer drinker) pizza was okay but would recommend more of a pub food."}
{"text":"Not bad for what's available on the waterfront, but it's expensive and the food is average. The patio is great, but you better get there early to avoid the lines. Luckily we've missed the line the three times we have gone. The views are nice if you're on the back patio. Service is so so. I think it's a better place for drinks rather than food. The fish tacos I had were pretty good. Cauliflower bites were good too."}
{"text":"A+ service in super peak hours, awesome margarita and great brisket sandwich. This is on top of the great beer selection. I was impressed!!"}
{"text":"Whenever there's a large group of friends that wants to go somewhere, Amsterdam always makes the shortlist.  You get your choice of front or back of the bar or upstairs.  The front is made for watching sports with large screens showing different games, whereas the back has a great view of the lake, and is more for hanging out.  There's also an upstairs which also looks good but seems further away from the buzz of the crowd.  And what a buzz. On game days, the place is always hopping, while on off hours, the place is quiet enough to carry on a conversation.  Right now the Spring Bock is the seasonal beer to try, and it's hoppy and bold.  Hoppiness is a theme with most of Amsterdam's beers, which shows in their Boneshaker as well.  Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Testify seasonal beer made with wild yeasts, and the taste is strong yet sweet with fruity after notes.  Can't wait for summer to roll around so that we can try the patio and a new batch of beers."}
{"text":"Lots and lots of beers to try and the menu WOW so many food options!  The wait staff is great.  They take their time explaining all the beer choices and they are just as excited as you are!"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR BILL. Great location. Good service. Very quick at lunchtime but food is mediocre and prices inconsistent.  The veggie burger is a scoop of rice mush on a bun with lettuce and tomato. Menu said it had herbed cheese but I didnt taste any.  Price online was $11 but I got the bill it was $13 + $2 for the salad which I didnt know was a substitution. Who charges $2 extra for salad??  Be sure to double check your bill."}
{"text":"Went here on a sunny summer afternoon and let me say the patio is sooooo nice! First I love Amsterdam Brewery beer, 3 Speed is my favourite! It's a pretty light beer. If you like very hoppy beers I have also tried Boneshaker which leaves a pretty bitter after taste if that suits your tastes! The nachos appetizer has really good guac and green salsa and the half chicken is pretty flavourful!  The atmosphere of the patio was beautiful and the waitress was very nice! Overall I would come again to just chill outside with friends!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were just here enjoying the weather. The best waterfront patio, but Be prepared to wait even in weekdays esp if you have a large group. My boyfriend got the brisket sandwich and I got the veggie burger. I was impressed with the veggie burger- tasted like a real patty (a little sweeter) and fries were amazing! My boyfriend's brisket was tender and flavourful , just how it should be. They have a great beer selection, I recommend going with the tasters! 9$ for a light beer flight and you get 5 good size samples of their light beers. (8$ for one beer)  Service was excellent and vibes were great as well. Definitely come here on a nice day!   Quick note, I didn't ask- but I didn't see a dessert menu or options in the menu."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant with gorgeous views of the harbourfront and Toronto Island. My boyfriend wanted to come here to try the beer and spend an afternoon near the waterfront, and it was very enjoyable. We shared a beer flight of four different beers, a margarita pizza, and I got the frozen sangria while my boyfriend got the patio punch. Honestly, we weren't expecting much from the food but the pizza was delicious and really tasted fresh! The beers were ok, but I was glad to taste them for the inexpensive price. The drinks were a bit pricy but were unique and delicious, and you got your money's worth alcohol wise. Our server Jacqueline was so delightful, helpful, an just generally pleasant the entire time. Made the whole experience that much better, I will be back next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great waterfront location and good beer. Haven't tried the food yet.  Tip - In the summer, if you want the patio, come early!"}
{"text":"Being fans of Amsterdam's craft brews, we ventured down to their waterfront location for lunch one weekend.  The menu was varied -- little bit of everything, but we especially loved the pretzel bread and IPA-infused cheese sauce.  Family-friendly, good beer, and water views means we'll be back."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! By far the best server I have had in Toronto. The ambiance was welcoming, and the menu had a lot of variety."}
{"text":"Waited in line for an hour for table out on the patio but the view was worth it!  Beer was great!   Cocktails were great!  Try the buffalo cauliflower, you won't be disappointed!  The wort reduction on the brewmaster sausage pizza was very interesting and delicious!  Try and get a seat on the upper deck if it's nice out!"}
{"text":"We went  here after the many places that recommend this as  best patio. It was so busy any tables were 30 mins waits. Slow service. The staff didn't care as much. My son was given a cup that all kids were given but without any straws. I asked for a straw and was told we are out of sippy cup straws. While more and more kids went by with those cups and were serving new kids. The food came cold and the fries were what was left over from the bottom of the pans. Not good and would not recommend for the service or food. Sad for a restaurant that size."}
{"text":"The nice thing about this place is the setting. Great location, beautiful inside, cozy in the winter, breezy in the summer. Obviously a solid beer selection, and it's fun to get a taster pack.   My gf and I are vegans though, and though we don't expect to be catered to, it'd be nice to have a few options on the menu, even just 1 or 2. I mean, this is why we don't really eat here. It's very meat-centric. I think the pub would be wise to cater to more tastes."}
{"text":"My sister and I came by for dinner and decided to order a bunch of apps instead of mains. We got: - tortilla chips - salsa, salsa verde and guac - shrimp tempura maki 10 - Soy gastrique, wasabi mayonnaise and pickled ginger - beer battered fish taco 12 - Halibut, fresh roasted corn, house pickled red onion, tomato, avocado mayo, fresh coriander, black beans, soft white corn tortilla & chili mayo - boneshaker cheddar dip 13 - Toasted pretzel breads, pickled vegetables. 13 - old fashioned  - three caesar (two of them doubles) with cocktail shrimp - a beer - three shots  The food was seriously \"meh\". Our beer battered fish came out cold and soggy, shrimp tempura was a mouth full of rice and the cheddar dip didn't have much cheddar flavours and it was so runny.  The drinks was... just drinks. You can't really mess that up. However, the old fashioned was made with loose ice cubes so it was watery really quickly.  Probably won't be returning despite the amazing service we had."}
{"text":"I would literally move to Toronto just to be close to this awesome restaurant! I celebrated my friend's birthday here a couple nights back, so we were a fairly big party of people. However, we were seated within a reasonable amount of time (upstairs where the view outside overlooks the harbour... VERY nice!), our waitress was quick to bring our orders, and the food and drinks were great! Highly recommend trying the frozen sangria. Hope to return here soon!"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much when visiting Toronto we went twice!  It is right on the water located in a great spot downtown but that makes it always busy especially when the weather is nice.  The line for outdoor seating was about 20 or so deep and the wait for a table inside was pretty long on both a Friday and Saturday late afternoon so we decided to sit at the bar. Those bartenders work hard and were quick to get our drink and food order.  I went with the raspberry wheat beer and my fianc√© ordered a sampler.  They have about 4 different samplers you can pick from each with four,  5 oz samples.  We loved getting to tray the pale ales and I highly recommend the Radler if you like sour beers. I also ordered a beer sangria which if you have never heard of is a must try.  Red (or white) wine with fruit, a sweet liquor and the raspberry wheat beer-watch out it was strong! We went with a large soft pretzel for an appetizer which goes perfect with the beer samples. It comes with a delicious mustard and a sweet wort dipping sauce (tastes like caramel and what a great use for the by products from brewing the beer). For my entr√©e I went with the chef's salad. It came with blue cheese and bacon-for the price I was a bit disappointed of the size.  Dan went with a pork sandwich which came with fries. He upgraded to the poutine fries served with gravy and cheese curds. It was so yummy!  I must stop if visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Also they have really good beer. Mel was my server and she was on point."}
{"text":"We went here on the fly on a Sunday evening and although the wait was long to get a seat on the patio, it was worth every minute. had an awesome view of the lake, and billy bishop airport.  had the \"light beer\" flight and it was okay, wasn't a huge fan of it.  I'd definitely come back to check them out for food and other beer options!"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday and took the night to sleep on it before posting my review... hoping to calm down... it didn't work.   1) The door girl is absolutely clueless. She basically kept going in and out of consciousness as I was asking her simple questions. I know it's hard to hire good help sometimes, but you could train a chimp to be more hospitable than her.  2) They were out of many beers... Seriously!? Its a BREWHOUSE. Am I missing something? Above all else they had ONE job... HAVING BREW AT A BREW HOUSE.  3) I ordered a burger. The staple of any pub-style restaurant. They can't mess that up right?... Wrong, it was as dry as cardboard.   4) The icing on the cake. At the bottom of the bowl of dip that comes with the Beef Dip Sandwich was an old bread clip. Ya know, the plastic thing that keeps your bread bag closed.   This place is pretty new and needs to realize how important first impressions are. I will never go back and it looks like that is a common theme in the reviews. Some advice... Close it down an re-open when you are more prepared."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place but is a major tourist trap.   $18 for a small dry pizza. If you're going to charge high prices, make sure it's worth it.   Beer and service were good."}
{"text":"Super hyper uncompromisingly averagely average. Not terrible and not very good. It's a place that serves food and drink that is located close to the rogers centre. The service is pretty ok I guess. Pretty much just writing this review as a reminder that I ate there that one time and it was neither good nor bad.   Pizza, wings, lettuce wraps. That what we ate."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant that I know of in the city. Useless staff will constantly interrupt your table conversations. The menu doesn't have many choices and after going a few times with groups or friends, no one has liked their food and no one wants to return. I wish another restaurant would replace this catastrophe."}
{"text":"With a beautiful view on the water, stylish decor interiors, and a large selection of beers, does the Amsterdam brewhouse hit the spot? Sadly not. After a lovely night stroll along Toronto boardwalk, my lady friend and I decided to stop in for a quick bite and pint. The Friday crowds were huge but the restaurant is huge - it's actually TWO floors. There were plenty of open tables but not enough organization/communication to get us sitted in a timely fashion. Their beer selection is varied and if you're a big beer connoisseur you'll have a good time. And that's all the positives I can say sadly. We ordered some appetizers and it was disappointment after disappointment. The fish tacos tasted like they came out of a microwave and the chef didn't put enough seasoning or sauce. I tried to chase the nonexistent flavor away with sweet potato fries. Sadly the fries were soggy and equally underseasoned. Lastly their famous pretzels were nothing to write home about ... so I won't anymore. If you want a good view with a good beer, this is a good option. But you'll need to drink a lot of beer to ignore the underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Meh.  This is a 4+* place for a beer and hanging with friends on the patio. Hard to beat the view of the lake.   The food is generic and fine (hence the 3*). The broccoli is worth trying.   Their core beer is good."}
{"text":"One of the nicest patios in the city.  It is massive with plenty of umbrellas, a covered area and beautiful views of the water.  We ordered the Leaside beer flight, apple butter BBQ chicken wings, Boneshaker cheddar dip (with pretzel bread) and Nova Scotia crab cakes.  It was all delicious.  I asked for the wings extra well done and they were perfect.  The crab cakes were the best I've ever had.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The place looks really nice inside, great bar selection. The food is just okay, however there were a few things that made our visit a bit unpleasant.  BEWARE anyone who is GLUTEN FREE! My girlfriend ordered the fish taco's that were labeled gluten free, however when they arrived they were breaded and the server told us the \"GF\" symbol on the menu for the fish taco's was a typo.sso she had to order something else after my meal came. Also the bus boy was overly ambitious. Constantly picking up our unfinished drinks to judge if he should take them away from the table. He took one of our drinks away, without us noticing, before we were done!  If you just want some drinks it's a good place to go, just hold on tight to your glass!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I went with 2 friends over the summer and had a great time. We all had sample sized beers and and I had their berry mojito while my friends had tall beers. The variety of beers was not too overwhelming. Service was okay, took a while to get someone's attention to order because we were seated outside.   For food I ordered the burger and my friends ordered the fish and chips. Portion wise, they were pretty big and overall the food was good too. Super filling and yummy.   I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Cool spot! Had lunch was a tad bit pricey the the drink was fresh and tasty right in the water also and had great music to add to the ambience"}
{"text":"I live in the area and finally got a chance to sit down at the Amsterdam Brewhouse. There were a couple things that I found to be a little off and thus why this place gets a 2 out of 5.  1 - Beer Prices For a local microbrewery, it seems the prices for their beer is a bit high. Especially for the Amsterdam Blonde $7+ a pint. I know the new place is fancy and all but were talking about Amsterdam Brewery here. You know, the beer that is considered the cheapest pitcher on most menus in the city? As well, no pitchers here as the rest of the city has them!  2 - Clueless Executive Chef Secondly, I just have to post this picture of the executive chef's caesar salad. I mean are you kidding me? This is supposed to be innovative to make someone cut their own salad and just slap dressing on it? I think this might have even been $11 dollars.   Comedy."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef dip sandwich. The texture of the dip was questionable- almost as if it needed to be melted. The meat to bun ratio was pretty low on the meat side. I also had more onions than meat on my sandwich. The restaurant does offer great views and patio seating. I chose to sit inside because there was a long line just to join the waiting list for the patio. It's hard to comment on the service, as every person who tended to our table was extremely friendly. But, service was far from prompt. It took a good amount of time for our waters to come out and additional time for sodas to come after."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business and it was a beautiful spring evening so we decided to eat near the lake at Amsterdam Brewhouse.  I tried their Spotted Cow wheat beer and it was okay.  My dinner however was great.  I enjoyed the brisket cheese burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  The aioli sauce complemented both well.  Wait staff was super pleasant and attentive.  I noticed a number of items on the menu that looked intriguing and hope there is an opportunity to go back and try.  Busy even for a Monday night and I suspect can get quite loud in there when the crowd is hoppin'."}
{"text":"Ok, so admittedly the harbourfront doesn't have a lot of options, and this place looks dazzling in comparison.  It has a bit of work to do to be best in class as I've definitely had better beer and better food at other brew pubs, but it certainly has potential.  The outdoor patio alone is worth the trip, it's an absolutely beautiful view.  I've found the service good on both occasions I've been, even though my server wasn't working the patio and only came to check on me once or twice after my meal arrived, the other staff were very attentive and obviously worked well as a team.    The food the first time I went left a lot to be desired.  The wings had good flavour but the suicide sauce was barely hotter than mild, still tasty.  My beef brisket burger, however, tasted a lot like Wendy's to me; which was fine because Wendy's is my favourite fast food burger, but seriously was unimpressive at a brew pub.  The fries were also a little cold and soggy.  The second time I went was altogether much different.  I had a small ceasar salad, which was good but nothing special, and the college st. pizza, which was AMAZING.  Another reviewer said good things about that same pizza, the one with arugala on it.  For me what made it great is that they add the prosciutto after it's cooked so as not to dry it out.  I hate cooked prosciutto as an ingredient, and overall the flavour was top notch and the dough was delicious as well, one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  I am sad to say I still haven't found a beer that I love, lots of positivity surrounding the raspberry beers so perhaps I'll try that.  The complaints I've noticed about them being out of certain beers is likely due to the fact that a lot of their options are from small batches, but that said there were 2 or 3 that I wanted to order the first time I was there that they were out of on the regular menu... so yes that sure is a problem.  All in all I'm willing to give this place time to shine, I think it can."}
{"text":"I've been here only a few times. Considering how near by I live and how much I love beer, that in itself is telling.  The selection of beer (particularly craft beer) is impressive and the constantly changing. The decor (something between log cabin and ski chalet) is quite nice, as is the view of the lake.  However, the food is definitely sub par, both in selection and quality.  Service here tends to be tolerable, though disinterested. One odd and off-putting feature is the omnipresence of mangers (?) who patrol the restaurant like casino pit bosses."}
{"text":"I really love this place, more so now that I've ventured further into it's massive belly than just the front bar area. A-dam hits every point and knocks it out of the park IMO.  Venue - absolutely massive, iconic, beautiful. This place could pass for a hipster banquet hall if it wanted, which makes me curious if they host large corporate events or weddings here. I mean the main dining area has two floors with the upper being open to the lower. Add in the aesthetic of seeing the massive floor to ceiling glass enclosure of the live brewing tanks on one side and the having a near panoramic view of the Toronto harbour/waterfront - it screams 500+ likes on Instagram ha ha.  Service - They've got you covered even when they're slammed. There was a wait for a table when I arrived recently but they seated us at the bar, took our phone number and sent us a text as soon as a dining table was available. I realise this is standard protocol at many places but I felt like I wasn't left standing or to wonder at any point. Once we were seated our server was amazing - funny, helpful, and not just there to take an order and move on, she genuinely enjoyed just chatting and hanging out (at least that's how it felt) she made great suggestions about must haves and what you should try next time, especially for my friend who was just in from the USA and who was a first timer at the brewery and in Canada!  Beer - I don't need to say much about this, we all know they make and A-DAMN good beer here. Many do skew to the hoppy at the LCBO/Beer store, but at hte brewhouse their selection of easier drinking options and fruity summer infusions was vast. I had an orange/citrus beer that was perfection (as well as some old faves).  Food - Wow. Wow. I had the SMOKE HOUSE BURGER ($15.50) which is a cheese burger made with smoked cheddar, bacon, buttermilk marinated spent grain onion ring. It was a mouthful of flavour and super juicy (like the kind that runs down your hands. Yum! My friend decided on a \"lighter\" choice (lmfao) and had some freshly shucked oysters as well as their HAND-CUT POUTINE ($8) which is made with massive Ontario cheese curds, and a beef gravy that was thicken with one of the by-products (name escapes me now) from the brewing process to thicken it up. The beef flavour of this gravy was so intense i felt like I was biting into a roast beef sandwich with every bite  - amazing. Easily the BEST POUTINE, I've ever had (sorry Montreal and Ottawa).  X- factors: out door patio on the water. Done.  Love this place, will be back and bringing friends when they're in town  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"- beer was good (but that's expected in a brew house that serves their own stuff) - great location and beautiful space (inside and on the patio) - hostesses seemed ditzy and unaware of how to greet and separate customers that are looking for patio seating vs. indoor seating - poutine is terrible. (even adding duck didn't make it better). it was cold, and gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds - many of the comments here on yelp say the same thing about managerial staff... and i'd echo that sentiment. was surprised to see a baggy pants, sneakers wearing, untucked shirt dude come and direct the hostesses during our visit... you can be professional and still be casual, man!"}
{"text":"Like the wide selection of beer and patio was fine. Service was fast and  food was very good too. Long lines to the patio should be anticipated."}
{"text":"Everything we had was pretty good. The Bloody Mary needed more Tabasco. The view on back patio is great! We had the veggie flatbread and poutine which we thought was delicious !"}
{"text":"Buffalo cauliflower, good beer, good food and water right outside the window. The Buffalo cauliflower was awesome, but I will never get used to Buffalo sauce in Canada. It is not the same. The veggie burger was quinoa and beet and it was ok. The ice cream that comes with the he kids meal is pretty awesome too. All the adults enjoyed the once cream. Check this place out. It is worth the parking search."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for dinner, pre game, or anytime of the day. Good food and beer, and the service/atmosphere is top notch."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!  The atmosphere, service, food and location was just astonishing!  Really spacious. Customer service was amazing right when you entered the restaurant.  My friend and I ordered oysters and a tuna burger (Forgot the name) We had more than a dozen oysters (Just because they were that amazing)  They were very meaty :) It is a good place to come in the summer for sure so it is not too cold :) A MUST TRY FOR EVERYONE!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful day to sit on a deck. Forty minute wait. Expected with the sun beating down on the large crowd. I'm seated. Fifteen minutes before I'm asked if would like a beverage. I wanted something fresh to toast the weather. I thought a bourbon lemonade might be a nice way to say, cheers. Wrong. I like bourbon. What a gross perversion of a grand spirit. It's another half hour before we get an order in. My red wine came 10 minutes later. Something inside the glass other than the grapes. I try to scrape it off the inside of glass. It's now at the bottom of the glass. Another 15 passes. I go to the bar hand the wine and order a white. No can do. Need the server to take the wine off the bill and take our order. Ten minutes later. My wife heads to the bar. She's no wallflower. Five minutes later she has two glasses of white in hand. \"Drink your free glass if wine\", she says. The manager made it right. Paid for nothing. He says the computer system is down. That's all that needed to be said. Our lovely server on the other hand. Jim Pattison, Canadian mogul, looks at the numbers of his sales team monthly. The lowest earners he imparts advice. Maybe this job isn't for you. Find your passion and do that. Indeed."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. I did not even know of it until we stumbled across it while out with our dog on a harbour front walk.  When we gave our name for a table, we told them we had a dog so sitting around the edge would be ideal, as we can tie him up and still keep an eye on him. We gave them our number so we could still roam around the area while we wait. When they informed us that our table was ready it had only been about 7-8 minutes and it was through the use of a text message which I thought was a cool touch.  While tying up the dog our waiter came over and advised us which spot would be best to attach him too. He also had a nice big bowl of water in hand for the dog which I loved.  The patio was beautiful and fairly busy with a great combination of shade and sun.  We started with the crab cakes and then split a chicken and Brie pizza. Crab cakes were amazing and not traditionally, which I like. The pizza was fairly good, could have used a bit more sauce but now I am just being picky.  The beer selection is incredible, I had a fantastic german wheat beer and followed it up with a sangria. My partner had a caesar and then joined me for another sangria. The beer was amazing, the caesar was good and the sangria was the best that either of us had ever had. It was in a big wine glass jam packed with all kinds of fruit and was great for a hot summer day.  I've been saying lately that I hadn't received any exceptional service anywhere I had been for the last few weeks. This place changed that. Our server was a young fellow with tattoos on his right arm and a nice citizen watch on. He was attentive, to both us and our dog. He was timely, friendly and on top of everything but not overbearing at all.   All in all this was the perfect stop in on a beautiful walk around the harbour front and I cannot wait to go back. Food wise this place would have been about 4 stars but the fantastic service stole the extra star with ease."}
{"text":"This is my first experience at this establishment and I have to say that it fell short. We arrived at 715 and was told that it was a 59 minute wait; no problem we went and grabbed a drink at shoeless Joes and made sure to be back within the time frame. Upon arrival we were told that we were not on the list so we go inside to rectify the situation only to be told that NO ONE will be seated until the kitchen is accepting orders again. They have a line up out the door, empty seats inside and a kitchen full of food that is not moving. What happened tonight I do not know but someone has dropped the ball. We are now seated two and a half hours later only to sit and wait another 45 minutes for a sever to acknowledge us. Whatever the case may be this is unacceptable in every sense of the word. We have had four staff members walk by our table and still have not been acknowledged. As busy as a night gets, there is no excuse to not greet a table as to make them feel welcomed, especially since they have chosen your establishment to spend their dining experience."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this type of massive 500+ capacity restaurant. On one hand, I think the recent proliferation of \"mega bars\" (Real Sports, etc.) within walking distance of the Rogers Centre, the ACC, the financial district and the waterfront is a positive for the city, both in terms of tourism and serving the exploding condo neighbourhoods. On the other hand, these massive restaurants often fail in their execution.  The BrewHouse certainly gets some things right. The outdoor seating is great, even if most of the tables don't really have any water views to speak of. It's a great summer vibe out there nonetheless. Also, the service was better than I would expect for such a big place.  As you might expect, the beer is the real star here. In addition to the mass produced Amsterdam beers that have been available for some time, there are many craft and seasonal beers. It was my first visit, and it was for dinner before a Jays game, so I didn't order anything too adventurous. The Boneshaker is quite good if you're looking for something hoppy. For something lighter and fruitier, the Market Pale Ale is nice.    In terms of food, I had the smoke house burger, which was decent, but the kettle chips that came with it were soggy and almost inedible. We later saw that they had a huge line of kettle chips ready to go out with each order. This type of production-line food preparation, while possibly necessary to serve 500-800ish people, really diminishes quality. In terms of cost, the food isn't outrageously expensive given the location, but don't expect anything amazing.  Many have complained about epic lines and wait times, but I'd imagine this will be less of an issue over time. We went on a Friday just before 5PM and got a table for four outside without any wait. We left around 7PM and there were still plenty of inside tables left. I would imagine in the winter months that they plan on attracting more of the local condo residents and those going to events at the ACC to fill the inside, since it's a big space to fill.   All in all, this is a welcome addition to the waterfront and a great place to pre-game before a Jays game if you get there early enough."}
{"text":"Food & beer were ok.  Worst service I've ever experienced.  Took 1 hr to get our drinks (had to remind our waitress), another hr for half the mains, had to remind our waitress again that we hadn't received all our food, and then had to wait another hr for the rest of our food (arrived just as we were getting ready to leave).  Waitress was completely inattentive and unapologetic, she kept trying to blame the kitchen (how she thought it was the kitchen's fault we didn't get our drinks is beyond me)"}
{"text":"Hey everyone I've been waiting for my food for an hour. I'm probably going to eat the bones of the chicken wings when it finally arrives. IF it ever arrives."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the burgers were average. The beer was great but took forever to receive. I know people rave about this place so I am giving it the benefit of the doubt that we just had a poor experience. I will probably return again if I am ever in the GTA. The atmosphere was beautiful and the patio overlooking the bay is unmatched. The place definitely gets busy so be prepared to spend some time here."}
{"text":"There are some really good bites here and some duds as well. Try the buffalo cauliflower-- probably the best appetizer I've ever had! You can even use the excuse you had some vegetables that day. The beer is really fresh and some are brewed on site (or so they say). This place can get really busy so finding a seat anywhere can be a challenge at times."}
{"text":"Went to amsterdam brewhouse on a Thursday for lunch. We sat inside as it was raining. It wasnt busy and we got seated right away. We had the mac and cheese croquettes to start and a flight of beer. And we also got the beerwurst sausage pizza which was enough for two people to share. The food was good! Our waitress Maria was great!"}
{"text":"Great location, food is good, and the beer selection is really good.   It's a nice place to get together with a group of friends or for a work event, but I don't think I would ever come here besides something like that.   I got the beef brisket sandwich with fries and while it was good, it didn't stand out for me and I felt like it was overpriced for what you get, though I'm sure there rent is not cheap. I also got the king and Portland beer flight and liked most of the beer in the flight, except the last one but that will always be different depending on what they're making."}
{"text":"overall, it was an ok experience. My first time trying this place. We had to wait 15 min to be seated which was good considering how busy it was because of the game. I was pretty disappointed with the menu items. Ended up getting Thai curry or something (without the chicken) which tasted pretty good but not enough rice in my opinion (and way over priced!). The view is amazing tho. I think if I go back I would eat on the patio or balcony for sure and try the pretzel! It looked good."}
{"text":"SUCKED!  When we got there, there was a dude standing at the entrance letting us know that they had a \"system malfunction\", and you had to pay with cash, and food would take an hour.  With this in mind, we crossed the street to Rabba, I ate a banana (to ward off hangriness, the angry feeling you get when you get too hungry) and returned, ready to see what would happen.  We sat at the bar.  It took 10 minutes for anyone to smile our way, or come over and say hi.  Not a good sign, but we were taking everything with as much empathy as possible, given their \"system malfunction\".  When we did get served, service was very strange.  In the middle of ordering, she just walked off - I have never, ever seen that in all my entire life of eating out.   Food did take a long time to come out, as warned.  I enjoyed my fish and chips quite a bit, but my dining companion said his schnitzel was \"the worst\" he'd ever had.  The beer was pretty meh, and not served cold (I had the Richmond/John flight).  Given that we live in a city full of great places to go, this place is clearly here to serve the tourists walking by, and should not be a destination for anyone who wants to enjoy themselves.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I love this place Right beside the water so obviously a great view and the decor is spot on. The place is pretty big and it's pretty lively and a great visit. We enjoyed our whole stay. The service was fast and inviting as well  I sat at the patio with my friends and enjoyed the beer and the view.   We each got the local beer flight tour.  4 5oz beers of local favourites."}
{"text":"Amsterdam Brewhouse is a large restaurant, bar and brewery located right on lake Ontario. It offers gorgeous views and craft beers in a laid back atmosphere.   The place is absolutely huge offering two floors of both indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived mid afternoon to be met with a 20 minute wait. Upon seating our server came over and was super friendly which seems to be the standard in Toronto (love this city).   As for the order we went with the fish tacos which were delicious and the Ontario brisket burger. It was o.k. but nothing special. Would have loved to have checked out their beers but was too darn dehydrated after a weekend of partying. Oh well, maybe next time. One thing I did notice is that there was an American burger on the menu. The description read.... piled high with processed cheese. Yuck! Not sure if this was a crack at America but didn't really think it was cool. We are for sure better than a processed cheeseburger.  Overall I would come back."}
{"text":"Fun place to go! We were exploring the waterfront area and ran into this BrewHouse - saw it had decent reviews - and decided to go in! There was a bit of a wait, but we found a seat at the bar to have a drink before our table was ready.   The bar was out of 3 beers, which wouldn't be a huge deal if there were more than like 12 beers to choose from. They were also the only 3 fruity beers which we really enjoy. The service at the bar was good - nothing amazing but definitely not bad.   After we got seated at our table, we ordered Poutine (excellent) and our main entrees. I got the Korean pulled pork tacos - they were fine - nothing amazing, not a lot of flavor, but weren't bad, and were definitely filling.   The service was really nice and friendly. Our waitress was excellent, and she did everything right - unfortunately the kitchen didn't listen to her and the sauces we asked to not be on our food were still on our food. We decided to just deal with it because of how busy the place was and how long it would take for a remake.   Overall - really fun atmosphere, definitely go here for the ambience and the view from upstairs - beer and food were fine. If you're only in Toronto for one night, find somewhere else, but if you're in for a bit, this is a good place to go for one of your nights."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a late night meal. We were starved and I knew the reviews were mixed about this restaurant. I ordered the soup of the day and it was amazing!  I would give it 5-stars. The soup was a tomato base with vegetables and it really hit the spot. I highly recommend it! The best part was the soup was also both gluten and lactose free.  My friend had the chicken wings and he said they weren't that great. He said they were tolerable though.   The venue looked really nice inside and was huge. I never would have expected it to be this big.   The restaurant also looks like a great place to host parties due to its large size.  Our waitress was also really nice. I would try going back to test other dishes.   I averaged the rating to a three since my dish was amazing and my friends came in at around a 2-star rating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I would call this place a good bang for your buck (considering the quality of food and the view of the lake), if you live nearby. If you have to drive in, be prepared to dish out $10-$15 for parking at a nearby garage as there's no street parking available.   Taking the parking cost into account, it did make me think twice about giving this place a try. I sucked it up and decided to give it a shot regardless, and I wasn't disappointed. We did have to wait in line for a while to get a seat on the upstairs patio (which has a beautiful view of the lake) but again, that was worth the wait for the view!   Onto the food - I got a \"Mushroom Swiss Burger\" with a side of \"Yam Frites\" and tried one of their beers too (\"Raspberry Wheat... Wasn't a huge fan of it but worth a try). The burger was a good portion ($15) and it cost an extra $2 to get the side substituted for sweet potatoes. The quality of the side was pathetic however, and I felt they were very stingy in that regard. But the quality of the burger was surprisingly good, and I enjoyed the meal overall (the lake view probably helped).   Overall, I would recommend this place to a friend. I will bring my fianc√© here at some point for a nice night out in Toronto as well!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to dislike this place mainly because I can't stand the fact that it has line ups in the summer and that it's so touristy, but this place is pretty good.  It's walking distance from my place, great service, they have delicious beer, and all the food I've tried here is pretty good too. There isn't a bad seat in the house and it's great for big groups.  In the summer time, a nice spot to grab is the muskoka chairs around back facing the lake.   Recommended food items:  Buffalo cauliflower bites - spicy and semi-healthy Pretzel -  great for sharing (or not) Kale salad - shredded kale with parmesan - delicious! any of their burgers - can't go wrong, although the veg burger is an interesting patty  Beers:  3speed is more...my speed (ha!) but if you can't decide just grab one of their many beer flight options."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of this place and I can see a lot of potential but the staff really needs to be trained better. The hosts seem to be all over the place and I experienced one bartender that was trashing american beers in my conversation with him. Now I have a huge problem with that. I love trying all different kinds of beer and I'm from the US. There are tons of craft breweries in the US and some of them do have exposure in Canada. I was very offended but I still returned again. I have been here 3 times and this is how I gave them 2 stars:  Lost 1st star with the hosts being super disorganized and not having cohesive information among them.  Lost 2nd star (should've been 2) from the ignorant male bartender that I experienced in the outside bar.  Lost 3rd star because I saw signs for Toronto Beer Week and when I asked the bartender about it he didn't know, so he asked another bartender and she didn't know. So he said I'll go ask my manager and I'll get back to you. When he came back I had to ask him again about it and he said no one knew anything about it other than what the sign said, which was located in the middle of the floor behind me. All it said was that they were holding a brunch one morning. A lot of help that is since it's a citywide event! We went to Mill Street Brew Pub the following day and the manager there gave us the whole background and history of the event and gave us a little booklet that showed us in detail, every bar, brewery, and brewpub that was participating in this event and where they were located. Sooo much more help than anyone at Amsterdam Brewhouse.  They kept 1 star because they do have good beer  They kept the 2nd star because the couple times I've had their food, it was good.  Overall I will avoid returning to this place if possible. Sorry, I know this place is still kind of new (even though I think it opened the beginning of July), it's been open for almost 3 months and I think I'm done with visiting this place."}
{"text":"We lucked out and as we got on like they asked for a any party of two to be seated and since all the party's ahead of us where bigger we got seating right away and at a perfect seat on the deck over looking the view from the restaurant. I enjoyed a flight if beers that I really enjoyed because of getting a little of everything. We order the Brie chicken pizza, poutine and brisket burger. The best being the pizza. This was just awesome. Great crust and everything on it was just so good. The burger was good but I find for the price it was not very big or loaded with toppings. The poutine was good but could of used a little more cheese. Over all the food was good but it really was the service and setting that really got me. Some of that being luck and nice weather. I mean this was an amazing view for a good dinner."}
{"text":"Finally made a stop here.  Great location and local watering hole for anyone living in the harbourfront area.  The restaurant is massive inside with two floors and large tv's around the bar - great for sports once the fall hits.  The patio is equally as nice with a large section on the side with it's own bar and a number of deck chairs facing into the lake.    Anyone coming here in the next 2-3 months is going to face awful service.  They are still ironing out the kinks, and there are a lot of them.  The wait staff all seemed a little clueless and completely disorganized.  We waited 20 minutes before anyone even served us and our waitress although very friendly was vocal about how it's a mess right now.  I went on a Wednesday night and I could just picture the chaos on a weekend (hint: don't go here on a weekend!).  After this break-in period, this has the potential to be a great spot.  I tried one of their signature brews and it was delicious.  Others had the flight (a tasting of 4 different beers) and also enjoyed it.  I really enjoy wood oven pizza and ordered the brewmaster sausage.  It was OK, but not great.  I also saw on the place mat that they offer free tours, similar to steamwhistle which is a nice touch.  A few items that jumped out at me next time were the pretzel and the beer battered fish and chips (battered in their own 416 brew).  Considering what the Toronto harbourfront has to offer right now, after they fix a few things this place will be the best patio spot by the water."}
{"text":"A huge space, right on the water, a name known to beer drinking Torontonians.... how can they wrong, right?  It is wrong, very very wrong.  Major Problem One - BYOE (where E is for Everything). I have gone here for dinner twice.  The first time was on the Monday of a long weekend, so I attributed the fact that the waitress had to run down a list of foods (with associated menu items) they had run out of, to a busier than expected first long weekend.  Tonight's visit had them out of 4 or 5 BEER selections..... IT IS A BREWHOUSE!  The waitress brought over the standard condiment caddy missing ketchup.  Being a ketchup user for my fries (requirement) I pointed out right away it was missing ketchup.  She said, so we're actually running low on ketchup so if I find one at another table, I will bring it by.  Letter in my meal, I noticed 7 or 8 giant ketchup bottles sitting on the counter in the kitchen.  I'm pretty sure there was bus boy or low ranked kitchen staff to fill up a few smaller table bottles to go around for customers.  Major Problem Two - Keep hot foods lukewarm? Both dinners here, I received my food cold - well lukewarm, but considered cold in the food services standards. Having watched the movie \"Waiting\" too many times, I never send food back for any reason.  Plus who wants to wait another 30-40 minutes for their food.  If I received my food nice and hot as it's meant to eat, I'm sure I would have a great review for it.  Standard pub food with twist in a cool space in the busy waterfront area.  Management really needs to pull up their socks or if not, hire someone who has actual (management) experience in the food services industry.  I really feel sorry for the wait staff because they are just the messengers.  My husband and I never cheap-ed out tips, but there may be others who do.  It is clear where the problems stems from.  Had great potential, but a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Staff is cool.  View is incredible.  Very touristy spot, which is annoying.  You won't find anything extraordinary here, but if you're down by the waterfront and need a beer or a bite to eat, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Amsterdam has always been one of my favourite Toronto breweries, and I've always felt that there should be more pubs & patios along the waterfront, so I was very excited when I heard the brewhouse would be opening. I tried to go twice before, but both times I was planning to go with a group and called in advance, I was advised by the hostesses that there was \"no wait, but a large line-up outside\" so we went to another spot.  On Sunday I finally went with a group of 4. I should have known from the line-up it would be a bad experience. There was a line-up of at least 25 people outside with a security guard and not a hostess or waitress in sight. The security literally keeps you from walking in to the hostess table and then admits you to walk inside and wait in a second line. While we were waiting for 25 min in the hot sun we saw at least 4 tables for 4 on the patio that were empty but had not been cleared and did not see a single server the entire time. When we got to the hostess desks they had 2 hostesses with one computer (the second seemed to be doing nothing but looking around). We were advised that the line-up was only for the back patio, and we could sit wherever we wanted - but the security wouldn't have let us in to do so! I had to ask the hostesses to send runners to clear off the tables because they seemed clueless that they all were open.  We took a table on the patio and waited, and waited, and waited. I went to ask for a server 3 times before one appeared, with no menues. We got out own menues. The beer selection was ok, but not amazing. My first selection was out of stock and I was told it would \"never be made again\". The menu looked fine for a meat eater, but as a vegetarian I found the options lacking. What pub doesn't have a veggie burger!? I ended up sharing the raw energy salad (which was pretty good - goji berries) and eating a pretzel. The server checked with us in terms of putting in the orders as appetizers or entrees because there was a long wait between courses - clearly kinks to be worked out! Our glasses ran dry after each pint and stayed dry for 10 min in between waiting/finding servers. When dinner came I had to go inside to ask for a 3rd set of cutlery.  Overall, management is horrible. Set-up is more like a nightclub than brew pub. The service was terrible and the dinner was overpriced for what it was. Nice location, I may come back on a weekday for a pint, but certainly not with a group or for a meal.   Management needs a serious wake-up call!"}
{"text":"Not as central as some might like it and busier during the warmer months, as Harbourfront is jam packed with people, with so much going on, cruises, concerts, outdoor events (word on the street) and people wander down after Jays games etc  However, even if you're not a big walker like myself, its on the Spadina / Queen's Quay streetcar route (509/510) and if you're coming from outside the city, there's plenty of parking around Harbourfront.  They have 2, could  be considered 3 patios, out front, along the west side and right along the water...not surprisingly, the latter 2 are the most popular and the waterfront side especially, is worth the wait.  Inside, the place is massive, 2 floors, used to be a fish house til summer of 2013. Its a fun, buzzing atmosphere and because of the high ceilings, its not too loud. There are tv's everywhere, I've watched many a Leafs and Jays games at the front bar, which has a massive tv on the wall, behind the bar. The beer taps coming out of a fire hydrant is a creative touch, as is the mural on the wall to the right of the bar, made up of beer caps.  Of the 1/2 dozen times I've been, the service has been great, took fam in town from Cali on Thanksgiving Monday, we sat on the side patio, 23 degrees and although they were shortstaffed, our server Hannah (we found out she was also a supervisor) and tripling as a bartender was great, fast, friendly, recommended beers to everyone based on what they were looking for. My personal fave is Big Wheel, but the Blonde is nice too. If you're not sure what you like, they have the sampling option, where you get smaller versions of 6 different kinds, great for sharing OR all to yourself.  On the food side, I've had the poutine, summer ravioli, classic cheeseburger and the roasted vegetable pizza. Not the cheapest ($17 for pizza, $14 for burger) but all were yummy,  would recommend any of them.  All round great experience, which keeps me going back for more!"}
{"text":"loved the food, loved the people. They have a fantastic patio option!   Instead of ordering the \"Chinese-inspired\" dishes, I would recommend trying their salads out. THOSE were pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, great beer, attentive service, a bar with TVs showing sports and loud music!  I can totally recommend this place with american cuisine and bar food. They don't mind if you bring kids."}
{"text":"A great place to eat with nice decor, good food and a variety of delicious beers. On a hot summer day, this is a place to  go and cool down for a bit with a nice lake view. I went with my dad and we will be coming back again!  Pros: -They have a good selection of beers and the pairings between drinks and food made everything taste better. -Food was filling at an inexpensive price. I got a burger with fries for around $20 (I wasn't able to fit the burger in my mouth from it's size!) -The music set a vibe for the whole place. They even played Eminem which fit in with the atmosphere really well! -The bar is first come and first serve so we found a seat after 5 minutes of waiting. -The patio view is beautiful, it overlooks the lake.  Cons: -Wait time is long! I was told that it would take about 45 minutes to be seated for 2 people (this was on a Saturday evening). -The plate I was given after being seated was not cleaned properly and had old food still on it."}
{"text":"Out with friends after a night on the water. My first impression of the restaurant was that a fellow physically blocked my way into the entrance of the patio area while I was headed toward the front door of the interior of the building, and requested whether I wanted to go inside or out. I suppose this is a tactic to ensure proper seating in active areas, but it certainly felt quite confrontational. I finally made it in and we were given seats. We were not provided with food menus, only drink menus. Also, I suspect another tactic to encourage you to think about drinking first. We were only there to grab a bite. So for 5 minutes of trying to flag down someone, I finally called out to a waiter with empty hands and advised him that we did not have menus and were waiting for a while. He turned his gaze to a table that needed bussing, thought for a while (hmmmm) and advised that he would get our server. How about menus first? Finally our server made it over, took our order, memorized it rather than write it down and left. 5 minutes later she returned to try to memorize it again. This time it stuck...well except for the sweet potato fries she offered me.  All the food tried was tasty, soft pretzel, smokehouse burger and  fries. I didn't have the heart to make her exchange my fries. My friend told her but only an apology.  So, good food but very young uninspired service. Enough places around like this to look for a better experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We got the Korean pork tacos, crab croquettes, and pear salad. All goodness. Typical brew house beers and flights. Hipster decor. Super dirty washrooms killed the mood. According to my husband the men's room had a sticky floor (and it was only noon). In the women's room, I tried 5 toilets before I found one that wasn't backed up and had toilet paper."}
{"text":"This place proudly advertises it has 500 tables, but don't go if they seem full. We waited more than an hour after we ordered and never saw a bite of our food. The waiter told us the kitchen was backed up, but the tables around us that ordered when we did were almost done eating and still nothing. Our waiter went to get the manager when I asked for the bill w/out the food. When the manager came out several minutes later, he went to the wrong table. Go to the sandwich shop next door. The beer I DID have was tasty, HOWEVER if you are going to be a brewhouse you Might want to have more than just TWO of your 'Specialty' brews available."}
{"text":"Try the local beer flights here! 4* overall. They make the beer onsite here which you can see through a glass wall from where you sit. It's a shame they had sold out of the raspberry wheat beer we wanted to try. We didn't eat here but it's a nice view of the waterfront of Lake Ontario with all the boats."}
{"text":"We drove to Toronto at a bad time - QEW was closed, the streets around the hotel were closed and we had no snacks. I could have eaten my hand... it was like we had to drive to Vancouver. We arrived at our hotel and this restaurant was just a short walk away. We were seated right away for lunch with a nice view of the lake. Service was slow to start and it took awhile to get a waitress but after she took our order all went smooth.  I started with a flight of beers, the pretzel and then the Poutine (what else do you eat when in Canada?) My husband had the Classic Ontario Brisket Cheese Burger which was huge.  He had to take 1/2 home as the Poutine was more than enough for a meal for me and him!  We did go back to the Bar one night for drinks and the service at the bar was much better!"}
{"text":"On a business trip to big T and a friend recommended this place; it did not disappoint. Unfortunately, I was only able to sample one of their beers (IPA) but it was a good one. Not overly hoppy, but plenty of flavor to satisfy any IPA fan.   I ordered the fish & chips and it was great. Came with two kinds of vinegar and Siracha (upon request). That doesn't normally happen, so I was pleasantly surprised.   Todd was my waiter and he was super; Funny, informative, and obviously loves the beer and atmosphere here. It's right ON the water and offers an amazing fun vibe.   If you are coming to big T, like beer and fun, you HAVE to come here. You won't be disappointed.  If you come in the summer, sit outside."}
{"text":"Awesome location and a great selection of beers! The service was also wonderful and we enjoyed our lunch.  FWIW - when we went we had to wait around 15 minutes to get seated."}
{"text":"The beer is good - the food not so much. Went here for dinner with 4 friends recently and had a lovely time but there are better places to eat in this city."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or a miss. There are times when I come and the food and drinks are amazing and times where it is not so great.  The most consistent thing is the service - which is always good. If there is anything wrong with your food or drink, the waiters will make an effort to make it right again.   My favourite beer is the blonde for that crisp, fresh, cold taste. And the bbq pizza is also one of my go-to's.   It is a good place to experience if you are in the area and it has a really nice patio in the summer.   Make reservations because it does get busy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here many times and it is great. Beer is excellent among my favs Downtown Brown, Raspberry Wheat and Cruiser. I have tried a number of dishes here and my first choice is Smoked half chicken. I have tried pizza and it is quite good. Among appetizers pretzel is a winner and chicken wings are second. Among desserts cheese cake is the best.  In one of my past visits I had an issue with a long wait but the manager handled it very well and left me wanting to come back.  I love the patio, it gets a bit crowded in summer but you have this nice view of the lake which is so relaxing. Seating area in the second hall close to windows with lake view is my best and I don't mind waiting extra time to be seated there or making a reservation in advance to make sure I get my fav seating. It is very cozy and welcoming.  The service is very nice and attentive most of the time, even at the busy hours it doesn't get too much delayed. Only one time I had an issue but I think it was individual case with a certain waiter.   I will definitely come back over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"We came to Amsterdam Brewhouse off of a recommendation for a friend.  While it has a few things going for it, our experience was worse than most and I likely wouldn't go back.  While the location is impeccable as it's located on Lake Ontario overlooking Toronto Island, the food was just okay, and the service downright horrendous.    Whether you are seated inside, or outside on the patio/deck, views of the water are awesome.  That said, it was a struggle to even get water to the table - they initially brought two waters for 4 people, and a water refill took another 15 minutes as they had to \"order\" the water from the bar.  Everything from waters and drinks, to apps, food, and the check, all took seemingly forever.   We did see our waiter with what seemed to be 15 other tables but all-in-all it the entire operation seems mismanaged and they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner at this place. Even though it was super cold out and hard to get to by tax transit the fireplace and lakeview made up for it. Found out they have free tours on Saturdays! I'll be bringing my friends here when it warms up outside.   We ordered the ribs and fish and chips. Ribs were pretty good and fish and chips were medicre. The staff were very helpful and offered suggestions on the types of local beers to try. They were incredibly fast with our food it came instantly after we ordered. Never had food come this fast before...even faster than fast food restaurants! They also had staff circulate regularly to take away empty dishes so the service was excellent.   The only down side like I mentioned was walking here from the ttc stop outside in the freezing cold and also the price is a bit on the higher side. Paid around 90$ for two people with drinks, no apps, two mains and a latte. I'll be back though! Love the lakeview!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times - most recently a week ago.  This is a place that depends almost entirely on its location for its clientele.  Which is to say, don't expect much after the scenery.  There's nothing absolutely awful about the Amsterdam Brewhouse, but there's also nothing spectacular once you get past the lake.  Service is spotty to bad, likely due to the fact that it's so busy.  Food is average but borders on overpriced.  Beer is all local to the brewery and tasty but the $8 pints add up.  Overall, while you may enjoy the sunshine and the water views, you'll likely get frustrated with everything else.  Is it worth it?  Sure.  It's one of our waterfronts only decent patios in the summer.  Just know what you are getting into.."}
{"text":"Large waterfront brewery near the blue jays stadium. This place looks like it has capacity for nearly 1,000 people. If you are just having beers like my group was there is no wait otherwise food can be very slow especially in and around game times. We were told even the fastest appetizer would take over 30 minutes to come to table.   Beers were good, there was a selection of decent size. We enjoyed the Hefeweizen especially. It had a perfect orange color."}
{"text":"Used to be Pier 4 Storehouse.....an boat/captain themed interior and loggy looking decor and atmosphere.  Not any more.  This is a new place freshly renovated. Line up and the crowd was a little insane. We took the lake side patio I  shade which was a good table with a nice view of the lake. The noise was something I couldn't handle.  Order beer in a growler, and the sweet chili rib ends for appetizer (our waiters fav). Wasn't a big fan of this dish. Too hard and sweet to go with light beer.  What I did like was, they seem to serve the right glasses based on the type of beer. Which a lot of places don't practice.  Their burgers looked really good but I didn't have the appetite for. Will definitely give a try if I'm in the area. Service was good. Wait staff we're too busy bu took time to explain the menu beers and recommendations.   \"SWEET CHILI RIB ENDS Pork rib ends braised in lemongrass, lime leaves and ginger tossed in that sweet chili sauce, pickled red onion & chopped cashews.\""}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice right on the water and the food and beer is great. We tried the pretzel and the brewmaster pizza. Both were great and the IPAs I tried were wonderful. It would be a regular hangout if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Average.  The place is huge and if you're lucky... but only if you're lucky... do you get a seat with a view of the Harborfront.   Pros:  - It's huge (capacity wise), and the music is Top 40 but it's AWESOME.  - The vegetarian burger was black bean and rice which is a good, filling combo. - The staff is pretty friendly, for having to deal with the amount of people they do every day.  Cons:  - It's dark in the Autumn. Like dark enough to not be able to read your menu dark.  - The wait is often long and they did say they were understaffed during our visit. They should probably fix that.  - I don't like paying extra for sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The brewery is very huge. I was there on Sunday night and it was very crowded. But it just took few minutes to take a table. They offered many options of beer for every taste, brewed-in house. We got tour flight beer i.e. we could have four samples of four different beers.  The food was good for a brewery. Totally, it is a nice place to hang."}
{"text":"I have been to Amsterdam BrewHouse a couple of times.  Given its location, the best part is definitely the lake view.  It is perfect for a nice warm summer day, so make sure you grab a seat close to the windows or out on the patio!  But once you get pass the gorgeous views, the place is nothing special.  They do have an extensive selection of craft beer, but the food is just average."}
{"text":"The service and location were great.  But the food, as delicious as it was gave me a tummy ache, so they lose out on food preparation standards.  Beware as I had the lobster rolls and lemon meringue in a cup.  Not sure which one was trouble but I would stay away altogether."}
{"text":"Came here with the boyfriend to check out a new restaurant as we were downtown.  When you walk in it is very specious and inviting. They have huge breweries off to the side and they even have a second floor that accommodates more seating.  We were seated right away because it was a Tuesday evening.  We started with the drinks menu and ended up ordering their Flight Tour drinks which consist of little pints of beer that allows you to try different beers that they have on tap.  I decided to try their John and Richmond Flight Tour which was their lightest and crisp flavours of beer and the boyfriend went with the Front and Bathurst which was mostly amber beers and a maltier flavour.  For food, I was interested in trying their Seared Tuna Sandwich but because it was close to Christmas they sold out of tuna so I decided to try their Chicken and Brie oven-baked pizza which had white sauce, mozzarella, brie, smoked bacon, chicken, baby spinach, and roasted garlic. It was a delicious thin crusted pizza and considering my favourite cheese is brie I couldn't really complain but it was a little on the salty side. The boyfriend went for the Smoke House Burger which came with a cheese burger, smoked cheddar, bacon, with a black and tan onion ring and a side of fries.  After finishing out food, we both agreed we'd come back again.  After a couple of days, we went again another day after work one day because I wanted to try their Seared Tuna Sandwich.  This time I was able to try it!  It was delectable and I finished it in a couple bites and as my side I had their soup of the day, which was their Cream of Chicken Soup with Rice.  Again, delicious soup but a little on the salty side.  The boyfriend decided to try their Classic Ontario Beef Brisket Cheese Burger.  Custom grind of locally sourced fresh beef brisket, brioche bun, white cheddar, and scallion aioli with a side of their house salad.  He mentioned that the salad was over-dressed with too much balsamic vinaigrette.  Once we were finished with our entr√©es, we got our bill and were pretty disappointed.  They charged us an extra $2 to upgrade to a house salad because it only comes with their fries as a side and anything other than that is an extra charge which the waitress forgot to mention.  The soup was also $2 extra and if we would have known that the salad would've been the same amount we would've both ordered the soup. On top of that, they were a little busier than the last time we came in and the waitress took forever to get us our bill and to bring the credit card machine over.  It was as if she was not able to multitask and she could only serve one table at a time.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience here but my second encounter wasn't too satisfying. I like that they have a wide variety of beers to try but the only disappointing thing was that the food here was salty and the extra charges for the upgrades.  Next time, I think I'll settle for coming here for drinks only."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, but TERRIBLE service.  They were way understaffed for how crowded it was, and on top of that our server was pretty forgetful - no one came to our table to get our drink order or even tell us it would be a while for at least 20 minutes, my mom still didn't have her glass of water (her only drink mind you) for at least 10 minutes after the food came (I had to ask the hostess when I saw her seating another table), and we had to ask for something else to be brought to our table three times.  My mom is also on a strict diet so her pizza order was a little complicated, and the waiter took time to make sure it was written down correctly (I think) and it still came out wrong!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the dishonesty from the one server. My father and his friend were sitting on the upper level. Upon leaving the restaurant, his friend checked his bill and saw that he was charged  $700.00 for tip. Shocked, they went back to the restaurant and the manager quickly came to apologize and claimed the machine must be broken. They found it hard to believe the wait staff had no idea about the large tip after checking the receipt. We're disappointed since this is a high traffic area, great for drinks after watching the ball game. After a few drinks, one may not recheck their bill after leaving the restaurant. We will be sending an email to head office."}
{"text":"Amsterdam brew house is DOPE A.F!!!  Excuse the profanity via acronym but I was shocked that I had zero knowledge of this places existence. It is exciting to re-live that night via yelp.  It is located right on the waterfront with a 2 level patio. View of the Island and you see boats cruising by. With the skyline clearly visible as your background. People walking the harbor while you enjoy your craft beers and their menu is pretty extensive. Wings were proooooooper!!!! I enjoyed the sriracha bbq - which was unique and delicious.  Pretzel Buns- YASSS!!!! salty buttery and so easy to handle with the different beers. They do not serve pitchers but hey pint to pint you can switch up the flavour- so the idea works. Come early enough and you can buy beer straight from their retail outlet to go!   Only thing- be a little easy on the visible drinking. There is a giant police station right next door. Dont fall for the trap!!!"}
{"text":"This place is Massive!!! Its gets packed here before a Jays game so make sure you come early to get your seats or make a reservation if you can. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat on the patio then the view is definitely worth it!  The food is your typical bar food with burgers, fries, tacos, and other deep fried goodies. So do not come here expecting culinary greatness.  The real reason you come here is for the alcoholic selections and they have Plenty of those! Everything from beer, more beer, some cocktails, and even more cocktails.  Overall a great place to come for a quick bite or a sweet view of the toronto harbour!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the location is great and the big commercial bar vibe acceptable. I'm a real fan of Amsterdam Boneshaker but not so much their other brews. On this visit we were encouraged to try an experimental brew that was interesting but not necessarily totally successful. Amsterdam gets full marks for trying new taste profiles.   But I had a poutine here that was... awful. Maybe more that awful, it was a criminal act, a slap in the face, a farce wrapped in a cruel joke served with some-sort of gravy.  Dusty fries, gravy that was trying to be fancy but flopped, and the cheese was melted on the top - it had been under a broiler? Who does that to poutine? I am no poutine snob but I have had my fair share of it and this was unacceptable.   The reason I know for sure that this dish was objectively, and demonstrably bad was that I was out on the patio on a cold spring night, and I was starving. I would have loved literally anything that came my way.   I recall having lunch here a while back and thinking that the food was passable but no great shakes. What is about restaurants whereby proximity to the lake front is in inverse proportion to the quality of the food? Do they think everyone will be distracted by the view?   The service was good, considering that the place was very busy."}
{"text":"Location: On the harbour front, so perfect on a nice day, especially if you're on the terrace.   The place: Quite large and spread out over two floors. They also have a terrace. In terms of decor, it's your typical bar feel - dark, brown, loud music. Personally, I never, ever wait in line to get into a bar, but my friends really wanted to come here so I sucked it up. Note that it gets pretty packed on weekends.   The goods: Apparently their beer is amazing - I'm not a beer drinker so don't have any first-hand experience, but my friends sing Amsterdam's praises. I ordered a chicken + veggie burger that was served with fries. The burger was pretty big, but the chicken and vegetables were barely lukewarm, while the fries were crispy but lacking in flavour. One of my friends ordered the tortillas with salsa and guacamole and she enjoyed them. Personally, I found this entr√©e to be very lacklustre - the guacamole was good but had a strange taste that we couldn't pinpoint (some kind of spice, no doubt) and the salsa was dull. My other friend had a burger and enjoyed it - something to do with steak.  Service: Our waiter was super friendly, but sadly, not very attentive. The place was pretty busy, though.   Price point: I don't remember what I paid but I think it was around $16, which I consider a little pricy for a burger. Note that this place is right smack in the middle of the tourist zone therefore prices are likely jacked up. You can probably find a place with better bar food, elsewhere."}
{"text":"Over priced. Its just a nice place near harbor front."}
{"text":"This place has great beers. Their Bonecrusher IPA is really hoppy and smooth. We ordered the pizza and pretzel bread which were both delicious. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were here last night and it was packed! We managed to get a place by the bar and honestly that was the best thing ever. We had an awesome bartender, he guided us with out beer sampler! For $8 it was worth the money! My favorites were the bone shaker and the fracture, something very dark check out downtown brown which is very hoppy.   We also got the chicken wings with the Siracha sauce, and we almost died those things were the spiciest wings I've ever had. Spicier than the suicide sauce I thought. Anyways we had an amazing time here especially with the service and the quality beer. I would def come here again!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe place is not rated 5 stars! The food was awesome as was the service. I had the tuna burger, which is cooked rare, and was unbelievably good."}
{"text":"ROLLERCOASTER of a night but ended happily as our kind waitress made ammends.  Food: 3/5 (hit or miss dishes) Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Cost: 2/5  Food: food is so flipping weird at this place, we for dinner. Options are pretty open but the prices made very little sense 15 dollar AAA beef burger vs 22 dollar ravioli??   The restaurant took short cuts and made food taste bad at times, most of our night consisted of nice food but twice they had made a horrible faux pa.   1) the green curry was by far the worst one i have tasted in my life. Fragranced but tasted of nothing with a huge over spicy ending. Got my whole table mad.  2) butternut squash ravioli a 22 dollar dish smelt of perfect truffles and silky pesto sauce left me gagging as they substituted PUMPKIN FOR BUTTERNUTSQUASH lol.  Service: honestly whoever employs waitresses and hostesses needs to be fired with the horrible waitresses and hostesses lol.   My hostess was unresponsive having customers chase after her (blonde girl) and completly unresponsive and not helpful to the situation.  Waiter young asian lady, was equally undertrained and had very little knowledge of the menu. Giving customers false answers or made up ones.  Only the last waiter after we moved tables for our uncomfortable pregnant friend that we had a glimmer of joy. She was professional and caring. She was a blonde haired girl who waited tables st the back  Atmosphere: well decorated and furnished but extremly loud. Had an upstairs,patio and game turf in the restaurant. COOL  COST: With such fluctuating costs, its not worth being disappointed after our last meal as having a good dish is as easy as winning the lottery. Only by chance."}
{"text":"The beer tour was fine at $8 for four 5oz beers.  The food was ok.  I had the chicken brie pizza, not bad but I have had better pizzas for half the price.  The building was crowded, loud, modern and clean.  Wait staff was very friendly even though they were busy.  Go for the beer not the food, or if you care more for ambiance over food."}
{"text":"When you go to Amsterdam BrewHouse as a Torontonian, expect to be surrounded by tourists, and expect a bit of a wait for a table.  You are going for the beer, sun's rays, and to people watch in a pleasant outdoorsy atmosphere.  YOU ARE NOT GOING FOR THE FOOD.  The fish and chips are an over battered flavorless mess, and the \"chips\" are big chunky potato wedges.  The burgers are also a fail.  Maybe there is something else that tastes palatable.  If you find it let me know."}
{"text":"I went there 2 weeks ago for a birthday dinner party. We had 12 people in our group. They where 30 minutes behind our reservation time. We where to sit outside and they said sorry its going to rain and we want everyone in side. NOT!!! no rain at all. Be care they add the grat right to the bill.  then service was not the best, food was medium. to loud inside."}
{"text":"Yesterday's visit to Amsterdam deserves 4 stars for food, service and atmosphere. We got lucky - in the past I would have rated some experiences here a 2 star. If you don't come at peak time and you choose wisely from the menu, you're guaranteed to have a better experience.  On this occasion we arrived at 2 for a late lunch. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out quickly. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Korean pulled pork on a bun. The pulled pork was tender and seasoned perfectly. The slaw on top was fresh and had a great variety of vegetables. If you order fries, request the scallion aioli. It really takes the fries to the next level.  Overall our experience wasn't spectacular, but it was a good meal with great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't yelp this place before coming in otherwise I would have been frightened off by the 2.5 stars! For us the food was a 4 and the service a 2. I got the brisket burger and my boyfriend got the mushroom, both were delicious. The bun to patty ratio was perfect, I'm not a huge fan of a big bun getting in the way!  Service was meh... Apathetic overall. In the beginning they told us to wait while they set up the table but when we got there and sat down we noticed the paper drink menus were dirty and had food stuck to them. It took so long for anyone to come by after that we considered leaving. The food menus were also crumpled... Non-paper is better environmentally but if you're gonna go this route please don't reuse them until they're gross...  I think this place would be great if they worked out the kinks with the service!"}
{"text":"Sat on the second floor of the patio. It was a little crammed at the top as we were seated next to the bar so my boyfriends view was of the bar and mine the water.   Delicious food and drinks. Definitely will come back again!   Update.  Ribs are very dry and barely any meat on them. Also, side dishes are expensive. Caesar side salad, which was about a cup of salad was $6 ."}
{"text":"Awesome location  Good luck sitting on patio long lineups  Sat at bar for lunch on busy sat afternoon  Lots of tvs for the sports games  Burger and craft beers hit the spot"}
{"text":"Visited Jan 27, 2018 Amsterdam is a great family oriented restaurant, there are not that many restaurants in this area. Some craft beers are made on-site, check out the store while you're there. They rotate the selection every few months.   Pros - Amazing service, warmly greeted at the hostess table.  We were walked to our table on the 2nd floor with no wait time even though it was a Sat night and the place was busy.  Beautiful views of the water! One of the unique things about this restaurant.  Veggie meatloaf sandwich tasted great.  Smoked brisket sandwich was amazing as well.   Cons - The restaurant is a bit big and can get loud.  Parking is a bit hard to find sometimes, there is some parking along Robertson Crescent or try the hotel parking garage.   Gina and Andrew went above and beyond to make our dinner amazing. Gina even drew a special message on the back of the receipt, wow! Will definitely be coming back again.   Damage - $37 after tax pre tip."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some drinks and food on opening day for baseball. Yankees vs Blue Jays. Flew in in the AM, found this brew house as we walked thru the area by the waterfront.  Have a good selection of in-house beers to chose from. The food was good, had a brisket sandwich and a side of poutine. Sat at the bar, bartender was great. Would stop by again if I travel to Toronto for a hockey game or baseball game.  Yankees won, by the way."}
{"text":"I like this place! I've been here a couple of times after work on Friday and they are generally quite busy. There is a line up, but it moves quite quickly. I believe they take reservations for bigger parties.   It's the perfect place to be on a warm, sunny day, with the lake breeze - watching the planes land. Beautiful!  The service is good - no complaints! The servers are attentive but not overly intrusive (ie. Checking in every 2 mins). I like being left alone to chat and relax.   The food is good, and they have some interesting combos. Although I wasn't a fan of the boneshaker cheddar dip. Also, an array of beers to pair with whatever you are eating.   Definitely a go! in my book."}
{"text":"Pros: Sat a large table quickly, good flat bread, nice views of the lake, tasty beers.  Cons: Could have used more lettuce with the lettuce wraps, extremely long wait for the patio.   Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: This place is huge, it's got a sports bar/pub kind of feel.   Food/drink: ordered the Richmond and John flight. It comes with 416 local, natural blonde lager, raspberry wheat, and adventure brew. Ordered a pretzel which came steaming hot. It's paired with grainy mustard and some maple based sauce which I much more preferred as it balanced the pretzels coarse salt.   Service: service is a bit lacking. Our server asked for our initial order and never came back. Though it was busy it didn't look like they were short in staff."}
{"text":"Overcrowded, overhyped, long lines, bad service, and poor quality beers make this a venue to avoid. Although the view of the harbour can be a nice spot to sit, the slow service and bizarre beers are not enough to make it worthwhile. There are a few \"pretender\" craft beers here that attempt to mimic higher quality variants but appear to be made with low quality ingredients. If you must check it out, I certainly would not wait in line for it."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars* Checked out the massive space while downtown. Great location as it is right by the water. Beautiful space with high ceilings.  But I am the type if customer who cares less about the packaging than what's inside the box.  While no expense was spared, such a big space needs more bodies to service customers without making them feel they are constantly waiting. Waiting to be seated, waiting to order, waiting for the food to come. They are exceptionally speedy when you ask for the bill though. I've also never been to a restaurant where you have to doggy bag your own leftovers (Chinese restaurants are the exception).  My friends both ordered beers while I got water, my water was forgotten.    Then there's the food. $16 for a burger - it better be damn good. The good - beef is cooked medium rare with some pink. The bad - the burger is so tall you get lockjaw trying to eat it. The ugly - the brioche bun is so dry I feel like I'm eating cardboard.  The $7 plain poutine is also a fail. I'm kind of glad we don't splurge and go for the duck poutine because if you can't even be the basics right, you need not venture further. The gravy is barely there (my guess also is that it's chicken gravy) which means the curds are not properly melted.   The only one decent thing we eat is their Margherita Pizza. Nice, thin and crispy crust.  I personally would not return. This place will no doubt live on because of location but I'd rather go a little off the beaten path to Against the Grain."}
{"text":"Stopped here twice while in Toronto with two differing experiences.  The first time we stopped in, we ordered the charcuterie board, Brussels sprouts, and the poutine. The food and service were excellent. The beer was decent, nothing really stood out.  On our last day in Toronto, we stopped back in again for a midday pick me up. We ordered coffees and desserts and waited. And waited. All the while, noticing our waiter socializing with others. We got our desserts without the coffee. Finished desserts, no coffee. My flourless chocolate cake was decadent. Finally, coffee arrived without an explanation.   Maybe they don't keep coffee freshly brewed? If so, communication goes a long way."}
{"text":"Flights were awesome! Best beers I've had so far in Canada. The food was great: ordered fried Mac N Cheese croquettes and Korean Pulled Pork Tacos. Both dishes were phenomenal just that our food didn't get to us 100% fresh, it was room temperature. Our waitress at the bar is very nice and friendly just everywhere so hard to get that one on one service. The music is dope. The vibe is dope. Such a good after work place, hangout place, and weekend fun place. My first time here and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"What a great summer spot. I adore the patio, right on the water - so relaxing.   This place does not have wifi. So, don't anticipate being able to enjoy an afternoon on the glorious patio while working on the laptop."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink before the Jays game but not a good place for food. I ordered fish tacos, buffalo chicken pizza and a poutine. The fish tacos were probably the worst i've ever had...overcooked fish and the tacos did not fare up to its size. The pizza was burnt and the poutine was smothered with too much gravy.   Overall, service was decent but I probably wouldn't come here again due to the lack of quality with their food."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to check out the beer scene in Toronto and had this place recommended by a tour guide. When we arrived at around noon, there was still plenty of seating and we were greeted by their friendly staff. For lunch, we had the chicken and brie pizza. It was OK. I appreciated that it was hot, but it was a little thin for my taste. My husband did a flight of beers, which he enjoyed for $8.50 (not a bad price for four 5 oz pours). I tend to like darker beers and there wasn't much of a selection with regard to dark beers, but it is summer so I'll forgive them. I tried their brown ale, which was pretty OK. My two favorite parts about this place are that the seating is great and my dessert was delicious. They have a lot of comfortable chairs inside and they have an incredible patio on the water outside. For dessert, I ordered a key lime pie that comes in a glass. It was SO delicious. Probably one of the best desserts I have had in awhile. In sum, definitely a nice place to have some food in Toronto."}
{"text":"You know what? We love this place in the summer.   You know why? Because the patio seating by the water is amazing.   You know what else? The chicken schnitzel is the best damn thing on the menu! Deliciously paired with some fantastic potatoes, saut√©ed bitter vegetables and crispy flavorful capers. Chef nailed it on this one!  Not to mention, cold crisp 3 speed lager? Don't mind if I do!  We'll be back. Over and over. For the view, the schnitzel, and the beer.   Love it."}
{"text":"Went there after a work meeting today and sat on the outside patio before dinner. The service was attentive without interrupting our conversations. There were 4 of us and 2 tried a couple of flight of their beer samplers.     We then moved inside for dinner however the server transition from patio to dinning area was not so good. We waited quite a while for someone to come over and take our order. It got better from there. No sooner had we ordered, the appetizer arrived and moments later, seconds really our main course arrived. The food was good, the service dramatically improved once someone took ownership for our table.  Would go back! Advice: arrive early, this place gets busy from 630 on."}
{"text":"Excellent location, service, food, and selection of beer and cider! Tip: if you don't want to wait an hour for a table walk right in and sit at either bar inside or outside. We found two chairs outside and had a cold drink in hand within 10 minutes! GF and vegan options!"}
{"text":"As a lover of craft beer, it's hard for me to see a brewpub and not stop in. Amsterdam brew house has the makings of a great beer stop.  Lunch was needed, but beer even more...the lakefront is awesome, but adding a nice cold beverage is even better...as a fan of dark, bold flavored bees, the downtown brown has a smooth barky start, and a perfect nutty finish.  Paired with a burger, this hits the spot. Now for the food.  Brewhouse food is in a tough spot, how many people go to eat the food, they go for the beer, and grab some grub.  Don't get me wrong, the food was very good, but very brewhouse. Maybe it is just the nature of my family, but we tend to do burgers, fingers and salads.  All were very good, but I'd rather, when you finish reading my review, know the beer is very, very, tasty...and the food is good.  Also, as a cyclist, the use of bottles as wheels was very cool...picture attached..."}
{"text":"Great/unique place to visit while in Toronto. I especially loved the frozen Sangria-never have seen this before but it is a great idea. It is served with Sangria frozen slush and along side it a small carafe of wine to pour/mix in amazing! Also have a small gift shop-merchandise was very cute!"}
{"text":"The view and setting of the BrewHouse is incredible, whether you're on the patio or dining inside. You're right by Harbourfront, with the view of the CN Tower. I shared a beer flight with my boyfriend for only $9, which for beer fanatics is always fun! Aside from the beer, which I have no complaints about, the Buffalo Cauliflower was our favourite. The prices are decent, not too expensive but not cheap either - pretty reasonable for Downtown Toronto. However, the burgers weren't the best option and our waitor took his precious time and kept us waiting. Hopefully, future customers won't have to wait and ask other waitresses to call their waitor!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up I don't drink beer so this review is on the food and what little I know of beer haha :-)  So our group of friends decided to come here on a Sunday night for one of those catch up dinners. After reviewing the menu online, I was quite excited to give this place a go! The place itself is very nice and I can picture it very lively when it's not a Sunday. When we arrived we were greeted right away and showed to our table promptly. Our waitress was nice and super knowledgeable on the types of beers. Thankfully, for the non beer drinkers they have ciders and coolers as well as soda!   The food was good! My boyfriend was forced to order the Southern Smothered ribs so I could catch a nibble without ordering it myself. For myself, I ordered the Ontario brisket burger. It was good, I'm a fan of the scallion aioli but the actual meat seemed to be a tad on the dry side? As for the southern ribs, my boyfriend pretty much licked everything clean. The ribs were so so for me and the cornbread was very dry. Now, the collard greens were alright and different from what I'm used to. They had some form of vinaigrette on them and it added a unique flavour to them.   Final Verdict? It was a good place to come to with friends. Would come here again to try some other menu items and I'm sure it's fantastic if you enjoy the beer! They sure do have quite the list and different types! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Best service , long lineups, but when seated we were greeted efficiently, and courtesy. the prices are worth it, the food was great. pretzel was nice! and rest  our food was gourmet quality! nice staff, best atmosphere. was worth the wait! will go there any day! happy customer we are! good job!!!!"}
{"text":"During the evening walk around harbourfront. There were a festival that happened in the area.  My heels were killing my feet so I needed to find a closet place to rest them. I sat next to a small white bridge. Over the bridge, I saw a big sign... And I knew ....I'm heading to Amsterdam.  There were two lines for the outdoor patios. One in the front and one in the back. My friends wanted to face the lake so we lined up for the back. There were about 15 people in front of us. After 10 mins of waiting in line and anxious to be at the patio. We decided to go inside since we never been before.  No waiting time by the bar deep inside the restaurant. And it was a nice spot too. About 180 degree view of the lake, kept warm inside,  no waiting for tables, and best thing is having quickest service!  Found the fish taco a bit bland. The ribs were good. Oysters were good. The sample beers, I tried all the rows except for the top row. The price was awesome, $8 dollars for 6 type of beers. In the end, I forgot the pain and i'm glad my feet didn't gave up on me during the walk over to Amsterdam."}
{"text":"Been there on a quiet weekday afternoon. The staff was very friendly, even offering free samples, the choice of food looked good and the beer was really great! Quite a choice of self-brewed flavours! Also, the music was good and on the big tv screen soccer was shown. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to see the Toronto water from and a good selection of beer flights. Two levels of space both good for smaller and largers groups or simply a moment to look out over the water. We came on a Saturday in the summer time and despite larger groups of people, we only had a 15 minute wait.   The waiter was super friendly, informative on suggestions regarding the flights. We were not disappointed. The menu looked really interesting but unfortunately we were between meals.  Come for a nice time with friends, a beer and a great view."}
{"text":"You might not think much from looking at it, being a brewery restaurant, but Amsterdam's restaurant is actually excellent. The food is not just spectacular for a brewery, but it's really good in and of itself--there are a lot of great restaurants in Toronto, so when I say this is among the better ones, I know that'll be surprising to many.  The best thing about Amsterdam is the patio right by Lake Ontario--it's a beautiful view, they have a fantastic location at the best part of the waterfront. The patio is, unfortunately, often packed during the summer, especially on weekends and holidays when tourists rush into the city--but their interior is absolutely massive, and a perfectly fine place to eat, with lots of tables having an excellent view of the lake, just separated by glass. Every time I've gone and found the patio full, the inside was busy too but so cavernous that they still managed to seat me immediately.  The drinks are, of course, amazing--they were Amsterdam's wide range of delicious beers. I love the Downtown Brown, and the Big Wheel Amber. They also have decent wine and a very nice cocktail menu--their sangrias are lovely by the water in the summer.  The food, like I said, is great. Amazing crab cakes, and the sweet potato/yam fries are to die for. I love the beef dip sandwich as an entr√©e, but I've seen their pizzas and burgers and they look amazing too--there's so much I want to try from their diverse menu.  Service is quite good. They have a huge amount of wait staff, service holds up well when busy, which is something considering the sheer size and popularity of the place. Orders come out pretty quickly, I've never felt forgotten/abandoned which is becoming a rarity these days.  Prices are maybe a bit on the high side, but it's a somewhat touristy place on the water, so that's to be expected. Not unreasonable by any stretch, though, for the quality. Portion sizes are perfectly fine, average or a little bigger depending on the dish, I'm always happy with the amount I'm served.  Very easily accessible by public transit--the 509 harbourfront and 510 spadina streetcars stop at Rees St and Queen's Quay W, about a 1 minute walk from the entrance, and run in their own dedicated lanes, so it's a very fast, reliable ride to/from Union Station--maybe about 5-7 minutes, and cars come every few minutes. There's also an excellent separated bike trail with lots of bike parking rings, and there are multiple Bikeshare Toronto docks nearby (at York, Simcoe, just west of Rees, at Spadina, Dan Leckie...I could go on). Radisson hotel is next door with a parking garage, and there's a Harbourfront Centre parking garage just east, too, with Electric Vehicle charging stations."}
{"text":"Great location and beer. The food isn't terrible but not great either. The service can be patchy. Sometimes I have had to ask several times for a water and it does not come. It is like the servers are only interested in selling alcoholic drinks. May be worth repeating your requests."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a long delayed flight and finally arrived at our hotel. We weren't interested in looking for a restaurant, so just walked over to this place.   As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated by the friendly manager. As usual, I cant remember names...but our server was young, attractive and super friendly. I ordered the grilled chicken burger/sandwich. It was perfect and not too over-seasoned.   The beer menu was quite extensive and hard to choose from. Our waiter was able to help us figure out the right one.   We wanted to return, but unfortunately didnt have time."}
{"text":"I don't usually travel downtown to eat at restaurants but this time around we were a group of people and we had arranged to meet here.  This place is really cool.  Im not much of a drinker so I did not reap the benefits of the beer samplers but I am an eater and took full advantage of the menu.  First off I have to describe the view from the patio.  Literally steps from the water.  Great view of all the planes landing and taking off from the island airport and great view of all the boats passing buy.    I had the sweet chili rib ends as an app and they were great very juicy and tasty.  I followed with a brisket burger and it was super tasty and very very good.  The ceasar salad was lacking dressing but non the less still decent.  Our server was on the ball and provided great service.    My only complaint was that the apps and the main courses arrived at the same time leaving us feeling crowed at the table.  I truly recommend that everyone tries this place."}
{"text":"I'm not high-maintenance in the least and have worked in the service industry so I know the minimum expectations a customer has. How about a smile from your server. Or understanding that were celebrating at ur establishment so were in a good mood in a group-- from the hostesses to our main server just a sour experience - not a smile all night, Constantly rushed by them, no checkups during the meal ( so were waiting to order more!!!!!) and cleaning up dishes when we weren't finished --- ie I ordered pellagrino so don't take the glass if half full!!! I'm drinking your overpriced water!   I always roll my eyes when friends ramble on about bad service at a restaurant --- but now I know they can ruin your good vibes!!   Avoid this place if other local options are available. however, food is good, prices competitive and decor cool -- I'll end on a positive note!"}
{"text":"Really nice location and ambiance. Appetizers and beer selection are solid. Would recommend the cheese dip and chili chicken. Main course is really weak. Their signature (mega bux @$26) dish, the braised short rib was terrible. Dry, rough, fatty and full of gristle. Beef dip was cold and way too fatty. The one dish that was up to snuff was Fish and chips.They did try to gracefully apologise via comp dessert. At least the service was alright."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. We sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice. We ordered a bunch of munchies. I've never had poutine before but was told it was a 'must' while in Canada. It was good. I'd rather have crab fries back home though. The pork tips were the best thing we ate. The sauce on them was very good though I found the one I ate to be a bit dry. The buffalo wings were cooked to my liking. The sauce was good but didn't read as 'buffalo' too me and it was very salty. We also fad the crab cakes. My husband liked them a lot. I didn't like them at all. Maybe it was because I didn't like the red sauce they sat on? I ting know. I will say that their beer was very good. Many of the beers I had I toronto tasted like pilsners no matter what they called it. At Amsterdam brewery their IPA tasted like IPA.   All of their beers were delicious. If I'm ever back in Toronto I would stop in for a beer."}
{"text":"From reading previous reviews, I'm glad we didn't order food to hold us up for the afternoon.  All we had were beer orders so our waitress was there more often than not.   With that being said, great location/views.  Downtown by the lake catching a nice breeze while drinking 20oz. beers is my idea of a great afternoon.  Nice view of CN Tower from our table.    A must try for any visitors."}
{"text":"I admit I was a little wary about Amsterdam from some of the reviews, but the closeness to Rogers Centre, the menu, and just trying some new beers convinced me to check it out with my brother when were were up here for a baseball game. I am really glad we did.  I made reservations with OpenTable for when they opened on a Saturday, and even though I probably could have gotten a seat without them, we had a prime back corner near the water table waiting for us. There is a some construction and while it seems like the patio wasn't going to be opened, it eventually was. I was just fine inside. I enjoyed the comfortable chairs!  The bar was very spacious and it seemed like a good stop if you weren't looking for a full meal.   Our waiter Shawn made the meal. After seeing us wearing \"enemy\" team apparel, he was super friendly and we talked some baseball as he was at the series opener the night before. I was disappointed that about 4 of the beers, mainly the IPAs that I wanted to try, were out, but Shawn recommended some others.  He got our order in super fast and we had no worries getting over to Rogers Centre before the game. Took a little time to get our 2nd round of beers, but nothing major.  My brother enjoyed two Downtown Browns, while I went for the 416 and the Raspberry Wheat. All were good, great for easy drinking, and affordable!   My brother and I were both stuck between the two same items, the Ontario Brisket Sandwich and the Open Face Steak Sandwich, so we ordered both and then split them. Both were very good. Not huge meals, but made from quality ingredients. Steak was cooked well, but seemed to get cold really fast. I am not sure what the cheese on top was (goat cheese?), but it was a nice compliment to the onions and mushrooms. I think we both liked the Brisket sandwich the best. It melts in your mouth. Both the fries/sweet potato fries were a good sizes portion and fresh cut.   I will recommend to others coming to Toronto for a good, easy, casual stop! Thanks again to Shawn our waiter for the extra prompt and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I've come here one time before this and I was just counting down the days until I could come here again!   I suggested booking this restaurant for my mom's birthday. We were a party of 6 adults, two kids and a baby.   They seated us in the back by the patio entrance. It was perfect for us because it was away from the blaring speakers and television screens, so it was \"quieter\". I put that in quotations because it was still super loud and I had a bit of a headache after coming out but it's a sports bar so it is what it is. From where we were sitting you still get a pretty view of the lake, which is nice!   We were served by a waitress-in-training. Even despite this, she was great (friendly and prompt) and came to check in on us a couple times. The host at the front said to let the waitress know it was my mom's birthday because they'll do something special( which we did) but nothing happened. We didn't mind so much because we were all tired from having a busy day but I'm curious as to what the \"special\" thing would've been!   I started with a Classic caesar which took FOREVER to come out. Our waitress apologized and even came beforehand to let me know it was going to be a while so I appreciated that a lot. I get the bartender struggle.. It was a beautiful day and everyone was ordering drinks!   As for the food, we all shared our food so I got a little taste of everything...  Seared tuna appy: yum! I could've ordered two of these. The presentation was also beautiful.  Mac and cheese poppers: delish! Not a fan of the tomato smear on the plate though...   Ribs: SO dry. The sauce was good but not enough to compensate for the sawdust that was passed off as the rib meat.. However, the coleslaw (tasty- I would buy this if they sold a big take home package of it), cornbread (yummy but a bit on the dry side) and beans (love the bacon bits) were delicious. I would order those sides on their own if I could!   Fish tacos: OMG you just have to order these! I wish they came with more because they are kind of tiny in size. But I also do have a huge stomach so maybe that's just me lol loved this appy!  Cheeseburger: full of flavour with a nice soft bun. I would order this again. They also have a side of the steak fries, which were super on point!   Kale salad: I'm sorry but this was the worst plate. It was literally just chopped up kale and dressing. Like, let's get a little creative here and put some baby tomatoes or julienned carrots or SOMETHING. I felt so bad for my mom, who felt bad leaving leftovers and forced herself to try to finish it. I would try the Chopped Salad or Pear and goat cheese salad instead.  Salmon plate: I didn't have any of those but my grandma loved it (and she's picky!)   The kids had the chicken nuggets and fries: the chicken nuggets were nice and tender so I stole a few of those :)   I took a star off because the ribs were horrible and were my main dish so it kind of ruined my meal for me. I didn't finish my ribs and didn't want to ask my family for more of their food that they were already sharing so I went home a bit hungry still. However... All in all, I would come back here again but for patio drinks!!"}
{"text":"the lineup for the patio outside was extremely busy.  of coarse its a prime area, touristy and when the weather is good you cant imagine it not busy.  i mean i came on a tuesday and it was a packed patio.  funny snough inside was not busy at all.    with that said afted lining up outside for 10mins in an unmovable line we decided to get seated.  it was a pleasent surprise the satmosphere, decor , wooden modern charm.   tge place had a vastness to it a bigger than life feeling.  very well executed.  its 0eobably one of the only few places that cam drawn in almost any crowd and type of person. appropriate for famillies and also 20-40s.  the waitress we had was seeming to have been having a day day.  .my bf asked a question about beer pairing and she medely pointed at the menu and said, its all there by letter.  very effortless and poor customer care.  at another point we had asked a waitress for help who apparently was a manager and we did not know she got our waitress who all of a sudden said, \"is there a problem here?\" as if we put in a complaint....about her which was her own imagination.  all in all customer service was 2.5/3 out of 5 because my group of friends experienced her as rude.  but we believe everyone has bad days so thats okay and we hope she feels better.  foodwise everything was excellent."}
{"text":"We visited twice already and it's great!!! The service was good, but the food was excellent! Great beer selection, the view to the lake (or screens if you rather see sports) is awesome, and the atmosphere is captivating."}
{"text":"Good location but that's about it. I ordered the veggie burger which turned out to be the worst burger I've ever had. Just a pile of mush, with no taste. It actually looked so bad that I thought it was a joke. Everything was cold, including the fries."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. The food is incredible and the beer is superb. Wondeful atmosphere to have an amazing time with your friends and family."}
{"text":"The food here is just okay.  I've been here twice (both times on my trip to Toronto) mainly because it has a great view of the water and a great beer selection with different tasting menus.  The restaurant itself is really spacious and an all around fun vibe- this would be a great spot for any type of group party, or to watch the games.   The food is traditional bar food- pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, etc.  I've never tried anything that was really mind blowing so I'd recommend coming here for a few beers and going somewhere different for a great meal."}
{"text":"At this time I've been waiting for more than 1 hour for the dishes. Nobody has given a word about the delay. I have seen people living the resturant without eating. I will never come back."}
{"text":"I'm actually shocked by the high ratings of this place... so many servers working but I can't even get my water until 45 minutes of sitting and saying \"excuse me!\" to every waitress and waiter walking by but continually getting ignored. They have maybe 1 waiter for every 10-15 tables which is not bad at all, I've been a waitress and could handle this well enough so I don't empathize with this awful customer service. If all your people are new, have them shadow somebody not run around like chickens with their heads cut off. Ridiculous for a western place, I've had better service at those dingy Chinese places. The food was just okay, expensive for what it was and definitely did not make up for the shitty service. Definitely would not recommend and will never be back."}
{"text":"Very nice building and location. Service was very bad however. We requested an outside table but were told it would be 40+ minutes, but the whole time we were there saw multiple open tables outside, some even left uncleared. We waited too long for an inside table just to be sat at a table, not waited on, and finally moved to another table. Service was still poor, things were forgotten and very slow overall. If it was properly staffed I imagine it would have been a much more pleasant experience. Lots of potential but a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love a good IPA and there were a few to choose from, so I got a flight! Food was excellent. Staff were very kind. Would love to go back when it is nicer out so I could sit on the patio."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on Saturday afternoon after biking to cool down, and had wonderful service and shared 2 flights of beer. Overall, we really liked half I would say, and the other half were good just not one we would order a pint of.  Did not eat while we were here, but the menu sounded great and bartender had a lot of suggestions which was great!  Would absolutely come back if we were in the area. Great location, sit at the bar on the back side so you can see the water more."}
{"text":"We decided to play tourist for the day and spent the day in downtown Toronto. We stopped for lunch at Amsterdam Brewhouse. We managed to snag the last available table on the patio (not facing the lake, we were on the north side but were happy to spend some time in the shade on this hot summer day). We enjoyed ice-cold Somersby cider too. I had fish tacos with fries for lunch. It was awesome! The fish tacos had beer-battered fish with some spicy sauce on it that was so good! My friends had pizza and salads and enjoyed their choices as well. With a location right down on the lakefront, this restaurant cannot be beat. We had a great server as well."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the grapefruit beer was so good we went back a second day just for the beer!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. I was told it would be a 15-20 min wait for a table but it was really only 5. Great selection of brews and the menu is nicely paired with suggestions that would help your palate teuely appreciate the brew house experience.   The place gave me a camp dining hall feel that seemed to perfect with the lake view. Next time I will do the tours as I will not bring my Daughter.    My Daughter ordered the the bow tie pasta that she enjoyed it just seemed like alot of water due to the veggies in it. My Wife ordered the smoked brisket which was....WOW..Meat pulled apart very easy, awesome flavors. I got the half chicken dinner that was an awful lot to eat. Great tasting sauce. I liked the cornmeal muffin as well as the beans.   Like I said I will most definitely come back but this time....I'm doing the tour and having a few more flights."}
{"text":"Perfect place for dinner. The beer selection is wonderful and top notch. The ambience is amazing as the interior is classy pub style and sits right on the water so you can look out and have a perfect view while you eat. You can also opt to sit outside and really enjoy the easy access to nature. You seriously forget that you're even in a city here. The food is spectacular. You're looking at $20 range meals and $7-8 beers. The service is a tad lacking as my friend explicitly asked for no ice in her pop but was given ice anyway--rookie serving mistake. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Loses a star just cause it does get a bit overcrowded and service slows down, but they are trying their best. Recommended dishes: Pretzels and Boneshaker Cheddar dip, fish tacos, fish & chips. Buffalo Cauliflower is good but gets lost in too much sauce. Skip the brisket sandwich. Take some time and do some of the beer flights and enjoy the lake front view."}
{"text":"For the price, this restaurant doesn't justify that with their food or long waiting times. I would not go back. The food was fine, but I did leave hungry and picked up a slice of pizza after leaving down the street. I shouldn't leave a $35 meal hungry for more, The price $35 is before tip and just a main and 1 drink. My server was somewhat rude almost and overall the only thing I loved about this restaurant was the view. Also, the line to wait for the patio is right next to the dumpsters so it smells horrible and is disgusting standing in line for a restaurant 3 feet from rotting trash."}
{"text":"2 things make this place special: Their lovely patio on the Toronto waterfront, and free beer tours!  Lets start with the beer, as after all this is a BrewHouse.  While the bulk of Amsterdam's beers are made in their Leaside warehouse, they are brewing several local seasonal beers on site. One such beer at this moment is a Raspberry Gose charmingly named Loretta, as well as a quality hoppy lager named Farewell Tour. These beers are only available on tap at the Brew House (and apparently occasionally, but less likely, in the attached retail store).  They offer free tours every day which are available by registering through their website. The tour lasts about 30 minutes. You start by sampling a beer, having a discussion about beer ingredients, types and processes. They walk you through the brewing area so you can see the fermenting tanks up close. Once wrapping things up, we were given another sample of another on site brewed beer. Its a high level educational introduction to understand more about the inner workings of beer brewing, but also Amsterdam Brewing itself specifically (things like brewing schedules, ingredients, use of beer supplies in their kitchen recipes, etc), so I definitely recommend giving it a go if you're coming here.  Now, on to the restaurant itself.  The place is big and beautifully built. 2 stories of interior seating, a patio out front, as well as a large patio that wraps around the side and back of the building, including the second floor patio. These back patios are really the place to be, as they overlook the water and provide a lovely afternoon destination. That said, expect to wait. By the time we were ready to get a table on their patio (1:30pm on a Saturday), there was already a 30 minute wait.  Once actually seated, service was friendly and on point. We settled in with a couple of flights... The only thing I'm not a fan of in this case is that the flights are pre-decided groups of 4 different beers. They had about 4-5 different combinations available but I personally like when I can hand pick each of the samples within. Given how busy they get, I understand if they want to keep things easier for ordering and serving, but I can't help but still prefer being in the control seat on these things.  Foodwise, this place is 3 stars. We had a few apps and a pizza, and admittedly the only thing I was more impressed by was the Boneshaker Cheese Dip, which came with a handful of tasty fresh baked pretzel rolls and toasted crostini. This was tasty and a good afternoon beer accompaniment. The rest seemed pretty run of the mill in the grand scheme of things. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were the weakest link of the bunch.   So, the verdict?  GO HERE! Do a tour, sit on their patio and sample a bunch of beers. Just don't make the food your main reason for coming."}
{"text":"Recommended by a sightseeing bus driver.This was an okay place.Didn't have a beer so can't say anything about that. but they did have samplers.I think it was 3 for $9?Food is overpriced.Had the ribs and they weren't really good.Fries were burnt.Service is okay.Waitress was slow.She was too busy socializing with her colleagues.She also seems to be clueless about the city she lived in so if you're a tourist I wouldn't recommend coming to these people for information.Next time I come to Toronto I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Key lime pie in a cup was very good. Wood oven chicken brie pizza came out fresh and tasty. Beers are expensive if you're an American but consistent with Canadian prices. Sampler of four 5 oz beer samples was 8.50."}
{"text":"My second visit and my second time being not impressed with the food. Stale bread and over cooked meat is the worst. Otherwise great beer and great location."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new go to waterfront hangout spot. I've been to this building nearly 20 years ago, and the renovations/remodelling done by Amsterdam Brewhouse are very extensive - the place is very hip, trendy, super busy, and has an excellent vibe.   The lakeside patios (there are 2 patios on the lakeside - downstairs and upstairs, and one sort of looking nowhere, by the boat slips / bridge), are excellent, the service is super friendly and not rushed, and while the food is generally pub fare style, it is very fresh and decently tasting.    Finishing off with a great selection of beer (although they tend to be out of stock on certain things), the place is an absolute winner - will repeat, many times."}
{"text":"Very cool location by the Harbourfront which was convenient after watching a Jays game (though we left the game as soon as we could to head over here to ensure we got a good spot!). Chose a section that had a spectacular view of the water and was kind of outside (but not really?) and since the weather was still cool that day, finding fleece blankets in our seats to use was a welcome sight. It felt very cozy actually and was an interesting way to indulge in some food and beer."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this place! I stayed at the Radisson next door and walked over to sit by the water early before the restaurant had opened.  My boyfriend noticed the adirondack chairs on the back deck and wanted to go back later in the day. Well... we went back 3 times. In one day. Yes, 3 times, to the same restaurant, to the same chairs.  We were in HEAVEN.  He had the Blonde Lager (our first waitress Katie said it was an award winner) and I had the Raspberry Wheat.  Yum, yum, yum.  We didn't eat the first time around since we were going to the Yankees-Blue Jays game, but came back after the game for our chairs & a snack.  We had the Mac & Cheese Croquettes and the Watermelon & Feta Plate. I won that round with my order of the Watermelon & Feta Plate (which I have recreated for the past 2 days' lunch). On our third trip back that evening it was late and we needed a snack.  We had the Margherita Pizza.  Light, easy to split between the 2 of us although I think I could have eaten the whole thing.  I am dreaming of the crust, something about it was just so fluffy and good!    100% cannot wait to go back the next time we are in Toronto.  We've deemed it \"our spot.\""}
{"text":"Very nice locale. The staff was very busy and appologetic for the wait while still happy.  The menu and products were good, but uninspired and nothing to write home about. Everything was ok, but just that.  The beer selection was quite substantial, but there are plenty of other restos that have the same and a far better menu."}
{"text":"Well located and large open floor plan. The food is fresh and tasty and not to mention the amazing selection of beers on tap. We stopped here when on a short stay Toronto and it was probably the only stand-out restaurant compared with some of the other places we dined. The staff are friendly and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"Great location! Decent beer collection and good food sums up this place. We sat at the far end overlooking  the lake, view was pretty amazing. I ordered a pizza which was good.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went there as our business team were holding a Summit in Toronto, and we needed a place to eat before our big day the next day.  The good: Food is pretty tasty (I had the chicken veggie burger, really nice). Heard beer was good. Entrees were delicious. Our waitress was always smiling. Busy nights.  The bad: Can be loud. You will wait A GREAT DEAL before giving your order and just as much before receiving it. Bathrooms badly indicated depending where you sit in the place. Can be busy so you might be waiting for a while.   Food was good, experience less. If we did not wait 60 minutes for our meals, this would have had a better rating."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in downtown Toronto HOWEVER, do not expect a good service on event days. We were four people tonight and no one got a glass of water. We ordered a cider which usually comes in a can and there was no glasses with it and when we asked for glass he said \"oh, ok\"!  We finished our beer and wanted to order another one when it took him 10-15 minutes to ask us if we wanted another one but we were done with our food by then!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food was great. Service was ok, the server was kind of busy but the place was not that busy. Maybe they were under staffed."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot. The food here is awesome, you're on top of the water in downtown Toronto, and the atmosphere is awesome! Highly recommended spot for either a casual dinner with friends or a corporate setting!"}
{"text":"I only went there for drinks so I'm not reviewing the food. I went to the bar and asked for gold tequila, the bartender did not ask what kind I wanted and generally she should pour generic tequila. She decided to trick me and poured patron, which I saw but couldn't stop her already. So with my next drink I specified that I wanted Jose Cuervo tequila. Here's the thing though, I asked her for a tequila sunrise and she's like how do you make that. Wait what?! Did a bartender at a bar just ask me how to make a tequila sunrise?! I was totally baffled. Lastly when I got the bill I found out I was charged 20 dollars for the one shot of patron. That bartender needs to be fired and not work as a bartender. I hope the management sees this. This happened on Saturday night last weekend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my time at Amsterdam BrewHouse. Our waiter was very helpful and nice. I tried their burger which was decent and tried their beer samplers which were really good.   I like the aura there. Music was good, the place is nice and big. Looks quite nice and my fiance enjoyed herself there as well. Would definitely go back.  Definitely try their beer samplers."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy this place. But to be out of your only IPA and your pretzel, either smacks of incompetence or lack of care towards your patrons. The summer season is just starting  and you can barely deal with early season crowds, doesn't bode well. Compounded by a 20 min wait for the beer I would not have preferred let's just call this not your best showing."}
{"text":"A great location on the water and a beautiful interior will greet you as you enter into this restaurant for the first time.  I was surprised at how much space and seating was available inside.  This place has a lot of potential.  As a brew house they have a wide range of beers to choose from in a variety of styles.  Want hops, malt, dark, light?  They have something for pretty much any taste.  Can't decide?  Try one of the four beer tasting flights that are offered.  And you are free to mix and match for yourself on the flights if there is something specific you'd really like to try.  I came in on a Monday night and the place was probably only a quarter full.  Service was prompt and courteous for me, but I do note some of the other reviews, and see where the size of this place could really get away from servers and host staff on a busy night  if they don't have the experience to handle it.    One thing I really liked is that the menu also had a good variety of dishes to choose from.  Some times brew pubs focus on beer variety at the expense of food, but that is not the case here.  For the food itself, I have a mixed review.  I tried the Lobster Chille Rellenos to start with because it sounded interesting.  They use jalapenos instead of the classic poblano peppers, making this dish a kind of twist on jalapeno poppers.  In my opinion they would be better served using the poblanos, as the heat from the jalapeno overpowered the sweetness of the lobster.  The dish also wasn't seasoned very well.  I wouldn't order it again.  I also ordered the short ribs, which were delicious.  Hearty, full of flavor, and cooked perfectly... this was a wonderful meal on a cold winter night.  Unfortunately, the side of green beans was under cooked and under seasoned.  Even though it was just a side, it's these little things that to me make the difference between a great experience and one that is just okay.  I'm a big believer in attention to detail.  There is enough potential here that I'll give it another try and hope that next time the food will all be up at the same quality level."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaas, I am SO glad we decided on this place as our first stop in Toronto. It's got a great location: right on the water in the heart of the Entertainment District. There is no parking (which is to be expected in an area like this) so we paid $30 at a public lot, and that $30 allowed us to stay until 7am the next morning - not bad! Anyway, the atmosphere inside this place is really funky, yet comforting. It doesn't feel generic at all. They have an awesome light fixture dominating the whole place, and a really tall, pretty bar setup. What made this experience so great for us was our server, Max. He was so, so friendly and really knowledgeable and passionate about the different beers they offered too. You could tell he truly knew the answers to the questions we asked and gave us his honest opinion about his favorites. Oh, and I LOVE that they offer wine and mixed drinks in addition to just beers. Perfect for someone like me, who enjoys the atmosphere of breweries, but not the beers so much ;) The prices definitely aren't cheap, but they're not horrible either. For that reason though, we decided that we'd each choose an appetizer as our meal. I went with the poutine which was very, very good, and also like a regular portion size, so, win-win. My boyfriend choose the buffalo cauliflower bites which were also really good, and a lot better than either of us expected. The flourless chocolate torte was our dessert of choice (it was my birthday, after all) and it was definitely very dense. Nothing wrong with it, just not my personal preference. The presentation was outstanding though! Awesome atmosphere, awesome menu, and awesome service."}
{"text":"Ok food, fresh drinks, great location.  This place, especially with good weather it's really crowded, there can be a long line outside, so be ready to wait for a table.  I like seating at the patio because you are in front of the lake and you get the whole breeze."}
{"text":"Gorgeous location right on the water. Big cool industrial space. Great food. The kale salad was huge and all chopped up and delicious. The crust on the pizza was soft and excellent. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Seeking refreshment after tooling around the city, our group decided to hit Amsterdam Brew House for beer and chow. Not a bad choice - while we were told we would have a 30 minute wait, we ended up only waiting 5 minutes and were seated rather quickly.  Menu has a ton of beers making the samplers a welcome choice. The reason the restaurant didn't rate higher was the lack of several advertised beers - nothing like being in a brew house...where they make their own beer...and having them tell you they're out of it. Must be good, I would have liked it better if they kept it on hand. Oh well, next time.  Food was good - the pizzas hit the spot and the spicy wings had a sauce I ended up using for pizza crust. Prices were on par with other places in Toronto - not cheap, but not overpriced."}
{"text":"While the newly opened place had great potential (location & promising menu), what will drag this establishment down is the bad front line management and lack of staff training.  What's with the lineups?! A security staff is making people line up outside. Someone in our party had to use the restroom and got in, asked the actual hostess inside what's with the lineup. The hostess noted the line outside was for indoor dining and there were only 2 parties ahead of us for patio dining - well this did not make sense as no one even bothered asking all those in the line their preference on where they'd like to be. And here's the kicker, there were lots of empty tables both inside and out!   Nevertheless, this 'insider' information allowed us to bypass the outside line and we then proceeded on to wait at the front bar.  I might as well have worn Harry Potter's invisible cloak this day!   The plan was to have a pint at the bar while waiting. In the whole 15 minutes, the bartender either ignored us or was simply wearing her x-ray glasses as she saw through us. When we were finally given a drink menu (after moving around the bar, first on the left, right, then settled at the centre when a spot opened up), we got called to our patio seats, so we proceeded on to our table.  We got seated and was left waiting for another 20 minutes. We were guessing on who might be our server judging on who was waiting on the table next to us, and no one acknowledged us the whole time. So we resorted to trying to flag someone down (called over to no avail so had to resort to a louder than usual voice) to get someone's attention. Our server, Jessica eventually came along (which we thought was because she was finally told to do so) and took our drinks and food orders.  Overall: with lots of other touristy restaurants in the area, I would never again have the patience to wait for seating at this place (yes it's hip right now, but with very bad service/staff training it's only a matter of time when locals will realize how bad the place really is). Yes, it's pretty bad, that I'd rather go somewhere else next time.  Word of advice: if you have to wait longer than 15 minutes for seating, you're better off going somewhere else where you'll actually feel like they want your business. Their food is comparable with other restaurants in the area, so you won't be missing much."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly staff! Our waitress even wrote a list of fun things for us to do with our children while on vacation. Toni was so great and engaging. Flight of beers was really good and a great way to taste some different varieties.  Weather was hot, but cool where our table was as we sat outside on the upper deck. Will definitely come back next time we visit Toronto!!"}
{"text":"AWFUL service. 6 of us went and we waited 45 min for food and another 40 for the bill after we were done. Totally disorganized. Got our drink and drink and food order wrong. Didn't clear the plates. Over charged us. So bad. Food was average. None of us will ever be back."}
{"text":"It was very cold outside. People were hogging blankets and they were sitting there with the blankets for a long time. The poutine was great. So were the pretzels and the wings. It was very loud inside the restaurant. They had great beer. Great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Veggie burger was awesome!! We also got the pretzel which was massive.  My boyfriend got the fish and chips.  We liked that they don't over salt the French fries!  We also tried a few beers and like them all.  The wait staff was nice and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"This review is for their beer tour only. I booked a brewery tour to fill up my day because I was in between events and my friends and I were looking for something to do. Hey, free beer tour with samples at the end? Sign me up! Lol.   The tour actually isn't that long or involved much walking. They just take you behind this glassed area where the machines are to explain the process of brewing. Our guide was really nice and personable. I got to try like 2-3 beer samples and it was interesting to smell the kind of wheat used in some of their beers. The guide we had was funny too, telling us about the history of beer and a  St. Patrick's day story about how a few guys actually got into a beer barrel lined up on one of their racks. Apparently, that costed them about $16,000+ and 3 years of time! Now they keep those barrels empty. Lol.   Overall, decor looks really nice and relaxing. My friend even booked a holiday dinner because she liked the vibe of the place. I don't know about the food though, haven't had the opportunity to try that yet."}
{"text":"Best service and awesome beer, not to mention beautiful location on the Harbour!! First time in Toronto and would highly recommend again and again! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful lakeside patio, attentive wait staff, and absolutely delicious burgers! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After a quick wait in line we were seated at a table with a direct view of the water, we watched boats and passerbys all afternoon. We had blankets provided to keep us warm as we were in only shaded areas which was a nice touch. I ordered the red wine sangria and the Amsterdam blonde which were amazing! Highly recommend the red wine sangria, it's absolutely delicious. I then ordered the fish tacos and Buffalo cauliflowers. The cauliflower was amazing I was scraping the dish clean I couldn't get enough! However the tacos were really plain, sadly I had to put ketchup on it to give it some sort of flavour. My BF got the burger which was really delicious, and his brother ordered the poutine which was the opposite unfortunately. It was essentially a giant bowl of fries, 2 cheese curds and 1 ounce of gravy - it was $8 worth of soggy fries which sucks because all three of us are poutine enthusiasts. All in all would definitely go back, would def tweak my order next time though."}
{"text":"Ok worst food I've had in a long time!!  The beer is okay but I can go to Mill Street and get way better food and just as good beer options!   The food was over salted under flavoured.  Just everything tasted either too salty or totally bland!   The staff was friendly but I came to eat :( so as nice as they were, it didn't solve the problem.   I will not be back let's just say that."}
{"text":"I noticed a lot of people gave this place a bad review because of the service. Its a very busy place and i can see how that can happen, although thats not an excuse, they should hire more/better staff.   i consider myslef lucky since i didnt have a bad experience and i actually loved my good. I had the chicken Shchnitzel, was cooked just right, not dry at all. and the side dishes were very good as well.   one of my friends had the wrong pizza delivered to him and had to wait a very long time for his food to come, but everyone else seemed content.   the outside area has a very nice view when the weather is nice (which is almost never in Toronto) so again, as a visitor i consider myself lucky since it was a very nice day.  I probably wouldnt go back there just because there are plenty of better options around town."}
{"text":"Loud, busy, staff lacks customer friendliness.  I chose 5 different beers.  They were out of around 6-8 including the 5 I chose.  I settled on the Natural Blonde Lager.  Meh... My wife had the Raspberry Wheat.  It tasted like raspberry jello flavouring added to a light beer.    We didn't bother to stay and try the food simply because we wanted a table outside on the water and that was not going to happen any time soon.  Considering the service, my hopes weren't that high anyways.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is the prices are pretty fair."}
{"text":"Love this pub. Incredible atmosphere, uber friendly staff, excellent tap selection and you can't beat the location. I think this may be my favorite pub in Toronto."}
{"text":"Terrible idea of not having reservations. We dined here Saturday afternoon.The hostesses was rude and unprofessional. When we showed up, the line was so long so I went to the front to ask if we need to put our names on the list. The hostess rudely replied \"yea go back to the line I'll come take your name. 15 minutes later, she walks past us and the people behind us in line asked if they could put their names on the list. The hostess replies \" oh didn't I put your names on the list yet? I'm so sorry I'll just put you guys ahead of people.\" This makes no sense and is absolutely unfair to the people ahead of us who have been waiting for over a half hour. Maybe you need competent staff to represent your business in a more professional manner. After such a long wait, the food arrived bland and burnt. There are several other competitor eateries that offer far more appetizing food & pleasant customer service to where we'll be taking our business to this summer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in one night in December, and we were surprised at how much we loved it. We sat at the bar. The place won him over largely because of the hockey showing at the bar. We ordered a cider, a caesar, a pint and a flight. Our bartender was super friendly and attentive. I definitely recommend this place for a quiet, casual drink."}
{"text":"This is a really cool restaurant with a great atmosphere. The food was top notch; we ate buffalo cauliflower app, 1/2 smoked chicken and a classic pizza. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar and my experience only with rear bar and staff: Great staff at rear bar. Beer is great and staff is helpful.  Nice views.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"I had a flight and the blonde was my favorite of the 4. A wheat ale that's nice and light. We had the margarita pizza and the Cobb dish. Both were absolutely delicious. This place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great location and service. They had a very good double ipa beer and make a good mojitos. The atmosphere was fun and up beat. Perfect place to catch sports because it has big screens every where. I give it 4 out of five because we ordered pizza and it literally had no toppings. It was thin crust with light sauce over it and oregano sprinkles. I was starving so we did not send it back."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go here because the Yelp rating was 2.5 stars.  But we lowered our expectation to get to sit on the water.  And boy are we glad we did.  It was a top notch experience from start to finish.    First, they said it was 20 minutes to wait for a table on the water. It was a relaxing (and shorter than 20 minutes) wait as they take your text number to inform you. I love that convenience.    Second, the atmosphere was so awesome.  Lots of people, nice view of the water, tables are far enough apart to be private, huge deck with lots of seating.    Third, the waiter was nice enough to let us know the french fries are not vegetarian.  While as a vegetarian, I am sad that I can't have the fries and would vote for them to use veggie oil, I was glad he let us know before the order was put in.  Along with the service comments, we were pleasantly surprised to have extra pretzel sticks show up without us having to ask when we had way more cheese than pretzel.  Nice!  Finally, the food was good.  We had the pizzas and the crust was just the right thinness with a little crispiness.  I love the one with arugula.  My only complaint was the Kale Salad was a little light on the dressing,g but easily remedied with an extra side of it.   Ok, now really finally. I just got the raspberry beer, but if you like beer they have beer flights.  I always love places with drink flights, so there is that too.   In the end, I'd definitely go back as it was a completely enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Service: Great Food: Great Atmosphere: Great View: Fantastic Stewardesses: Fantastic Stewards: Fantastic Price: Can hurt the wallet"}
{"text":"I ate here on my last day in Toronto, and I loved it! First I had the sangria with white wine. I loved how the wine came in a separate glass so you can add how much or how little. For food, I had the smoked half chicken. It was delicious. The chicken and sides were all flavorful. Great customer service, and an overall excellent experience."}
{"text":"The setting saved this place from a harsher review. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but fish and chips, fish was dripping in grease.  My son had chicken fingers and were overlooked with little flavor and came with what appeared to be habanero BBQ sauce.  Glad the boy didn't try it first!  Their IPA was pretty good however.  Hot pretzel (mustard and sauce was good)served as a fantastic teether for the baby until the food arrived which, thankfully arrived very quickly."}
{"text":"I could go here everyday for its location alone, secured along the Toronto Waterfront it is a beautiful place. Huge tall interior with exposed wood, multiple levels, beer vats on display. It is GORGEOUS! Plus the view of the water, closest thing you can get a cottage in the city.  I went there twice within three days and this is where my criticisms start to come into play. This place is brand new, opened about a month ago, and they clearly haven't worked out their inventory very well. So many beers and a huge selection of food (including onion rings and pizza) were sold out on my initial visit. On my follow-up visit, the supply was a little better but they still didn't have some of the beers (many of which they only make and serve there), however our server was great for providing recommendations.  Here's what was the best:   Goedemorgen--comes in a funky big bottle, which I shared (twice) with a friend. The server described it as \"drunk pears and peaches floating in beer\" but to me it was more like thick apple cider with beer and hard liquor mixed in. It was kind of amazing and at 10% made me a little warm and fuzzy.  Rye Baltic Porter--fantastic! It was so smooth and chocolately and full of rye it was kind of like a milkshake or a rye beer float or something. Even though its a porter I didn't find it too heavy.  Pretzels--like I said, food options were limited, but I did try a pretzel and maybe it's because i've been craving a soft pretzel for like 5 years but it was fantastic!  Retail shop--you can go next door and buy singles of many of the specialty drinks including raspberry, chug chug!  WRAP IT UP: Amsterdam Brewhouse is a gorgeous and original place with a beautiful cottage-like atmosphere. I highly recommend spending an afternoon drinking by the lake, but bring the $$ because it's a little on the steep side."}
{"text":"Who rates a place based on the size of their lines??? These reviewers need to grow up.  There are only 2 criteria that any logical person needs to know when looking for a great place to eat or drink: 1) How good is the quality of their food? 2) How good is the quality of their drinks?  That's it!  I'm not a fan of Amsterdam's generically sold beer, but their craft beer is very very good. And so is their food. So quit crying, and realise that the lines are due to the...try not to let this blow your mind...popularity. It's popular because it's food and drinks quality is outstanding."}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is the view. Definitely a beautiful place to come to for drinks or dessert. I would not recommend it for food. We ordered quite a few things off the menu - wings, pizza, burgers, fries and everything was just average. In addition, the waiter said that the burger has to be 'well-done' because it's against Ontario laws to serve anything under well-done. I definitely do not think that this is accurate - I have had burgers at many places in Toronto, served 'medium'."}
{"text":"Awesome hip  hangout, with amazing views, quality service and tasty treats. Bacon Brussels sprouts are delicious. Along   with the flights and main course. They are a very busy kitchen but extremely organized."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes sitting down ready to order and our server never showed up so we left. We flagging a few people down and they either said they weren't our server or that they'd come back. Lame."}
{"text":"The view and the size of the place is pretty spectacular. The have Muskoka chairs lining the back patio so you can face the water and have a pint.   Wonderful beer selection, and our service was actually great. I noticed many complaints about the service, but we were well taken care of, and our server was training another girl.   I had the pretzel ( i wanted to treat myself) and it was the best soft pretzel I have ever had. Hands down, BEST.   They had just updated their wine list and it wasn't made yet so I didn't get a good look at what they had to offer, but they are a brewery offering a wine list - I imagine it would be decent.   I'll be going again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a somewhat grey Saturday this August that ended up giving way to a burst of sunlight after about 1pm. But that did not keep my little group from sitting at the patio area to make the most out of the fair weather and to enjoy the view of the lake. At first not knowing where we actually going to meet I ended up waiting inside at the bar and taking a good look around. The ambience does make feel like I'm at a restaurant inside a big brewery as I could see big tanks one side that certainly held beer in it and the spaciousness of the place itself seemed to extend quite a stretch into the back. Only when I was told by one of the staff that there was a separate entrance to the patio did I quickly make my way there. I'm not a big fan of beer so I decided to start off by picking the Sweetwater Squeeze Radler which was a mix of their house soda, blood orange juice and a beer base. It ended up tasting great with the beer and orange juice complimenting each other in flavor and hue, with bits of raspberries and strawberries drifting within the concoction.  For me, one drink us usually enough to keep boozed up for the day but as the conversations among us got funnier I decided make the most out of the moment by going for a second round and ordered an Amsterdam Adventurers brew. Being able to empty out a second 20 oz glass definitely showed that I had become a fan of their brews.   However the food requires some consistency in the quality of the presentation. Of all the dishes that were ordered by our party the pizzas turned out look the best in the apperance and I don't remember any of the two people at our party ever making a complaint about their pizzas.  But the first experience of enjoying a drink with friends is memorable enough to get me to return for another fun time soon."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks and the waitress recommended us these beer selections:  * (416) LOCAL LAGER * 4.2% ABV, 20 IBUS  * NATURAL BLONDE LAGER * 5% ABV, 15 IBUS  It was displayed in two rows in mini beer glasses, it's cute.  The drinks were okay but service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"great location! beer is good, but available wherever.  never seen or had Fracture IPA.  good, I just hate that they served it to me in a juice glass.  roasted veggie pizza.  it was good.  wife had sausage pizza she enjoyed it.  service was good.  nothing was awesome.  not cheap."}
{"text":"Pretty good good and great place to watch sports at the bar. Kitchen was pretty slow is only knock. Didn't try the beer."}
{"text":"This place was probably my favorite experience in our 3 Day long weekend in Toronto.  We were blessed with good weather but the scenery the service the food and the beer was all absolutely outstanding.  It might have been great to have better swag in the store so we could bring home a memory that was a little light,  but I will be back there every time I possibly can.  Outstanding"}
{"text":"Was in town for a cannabis convention and a large group of us wearing cannabis gear was blamed for something we didn't do.  Management accused our table of doing blow and actually kicked us out last night because they found residue inside of the bathroom stalls   Of course they blame the cannabis guys because surely we're all druggies, right?"}
{"text":"Such a great place to be with group of people! i booked it a day before the party and it was amazing. Shawn, and Mary was great servers. I had Kate booking this for me. It was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Lovely patio overlooking the water and large indoor dining space! They have a good selection of beer and menu, including smoked meats.   I ordered the fish tacos, with battered haddock - I would recommend this dish!"}
{"text":"I really love this Amsterdam Brewery location, and have been here about two or three times now.  Every time that I have visited this place it was in the evening time, and it's been packed every single time.  Despite this, the staff has been able to accommodate even with a larger group.  I think this is probably due to the large size of the venue, and the well organized staff that keeps things moving along swiftly.  The prices are a bit high on the beer and it's only available by the pint, which is definitely a downside. The food is average, but I have no complaints about it.  This venue is right on the water and has a fantastic view.  This beautiful view and the atmosphere of the place is what really has me coming back here."}
{"text":"Great beer, nice view and food was decent. Service is a bit slow, but staff was friendly.  We ordered the Social Platter (Flat bread, pretzel, chicken wings and pickled veggies), the wings were yummy, but the best part was the pretzel. The cheese was a bit odd tasting, but the pretzel made up for it. Then we ordered the fish and chips, fish tacos and the salmon nicoise salad. The fish tacos were amazing, the fish and chips not so much, too greasy and not fried enough. The salad was good.  The best part of this place is the view, it is right on the water."}
{"text":"After several visits to this place, I have finally gotten around to writing a review.  My last visit, which was yesterday, I wanted to sit on the patio, the wait was not too long either. The staff was very friendly and willing to move me to another spot as requested. I got a spot on the upper deck right by the water; it was great.  I always have one of their flights, a chance to sample several beers, and their yam frites. They never fail me.  It is the standard bar/pub fare otherwise.  I have had their pizzas before and I liked them.  Next time I want to try their crab cakes."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly & nice. We ate at the bar & the bar tender was very efficient & knowledgeable of the beers. The bratwurst on the Oktoberfest menu was simply AMAZING! Try a flight to sample the beers. It was rather crowded for a Wednesday night so I assume it's a popular place."}
{"text":"Had dinner on the patio tonight and near the end of my meal was pleasantly surprised by droppings from a large spider above me. Drink and food was good but not impressed with the cleanliness of the place. Informed staff about the incident but no response received by waiter or manager. Would have been nice to be acknowledged, waiter brushed off the comment."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night after dinner for some drinks and tapas. Place seems packed so we waited for a table for 4, around 15 mins. location was prime and on the waterfront, but because we came at night we were not able to enjoy the view.   When we were called in for a table, the server took us for a LOOP around the whole restaurant (which is fairly large) to find our table, which turned out was right beside the entrance. Once seated we noticed a HUGE spider on the ceiling, but it soon disappeared off somewhere.   We ordered beer flights and appetizers to share.   Beer flight has bang for the buck at 8.50 but of the \"Richmond and John\" flight, the second beer tasted like water. A Coors light was better. Of the other 3, two were decent which a good ale taste and not too hoppy. The \"leaside\" had a much better variety. These are all brewed in house so kudos to that.   Food:  Chips and 3 dips: tortilla chips with guac, green salsa, and salsa. Nothing special at all. Only good dip was the guac. Green salsa was watery. (2/5)  Crab cakes: only decent thing we had. Slightly over fried, but it had good crab taste but had a weird cocktail sauce on it. (2/5)  Korean pulled pork tacos: were so dry we had to put guac on it for it to go down. Pork was dry and unflavored. (1/5)  Maybe their mains are better, but pass on the appetizers."}
{"text":"My husband and I look forward to our trips to Toronto, solely for this place! Amazing beer, food and most importantly staff."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places to take someone visiting from out of town for a drink and a bite to eat. The place is massive but the service is always good, and the food is interesting varied enough to appeal to anyone. Flights are the best way to experience the variety of beers on offer, there's frequently specials and unusual options."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great atmosphere. Will definitely go back. Beautiful waterfront area too."}
{"text":"The brisket was good, close to Hill Country Texas BBQ in New York. The grilled salmon ordered by my cousin was well worth it. The beer selection was expansive. Most importantly was the service. After our horrible experience at Watermark next door at the Harbor front, our host Nicole J #1 was very warm, accommodating and took care of us with great consideration. Beautiful view of the harbor.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Really surprised that this place only has 3 stars as I absolutely love coming here! Always have a fantastic meal and last night was no exception. Got the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza which is dynamite. My boyfriend got the chicken and brie pizza which is equally as good and we highly recommend both. To drink, I get the Sweetwater Squeeze Radler which tastes like beer and orange pop made a baby. Really good for those girls like myself who aren't big beer drinkers.   Our server's name was Hayley and she was very friendly and attentive. We couldn't believe how quickly our pizza came out after we ordered! Maybe 5 minutes tops. Had a wonderful overall experience last night and can't wait to sit out on their patio when the weather gets nicer!"}
{"text":"I love coming here in the summer because the restaurant has such a beautiful view of the lake. It's a great spot to bring people that you want to impress. If you can get a spot on the patio or by the window, the ambiance definitely feels more expensive than the place actually is. Definitely make a reservation for peak times though, as the lines can get quite long for this touristy spot. I always ask for a table by the window, even when it's busy. It never hurts to ask, and those tables are the prime location to eat! The waitstaff are incredibly helpful when selecting your food, and they're also great at suggesting beers to pair with your food! So don't hesitate to ask for their opinion when placing your order. I recently went with a friend and we had the Smoke House Burger and Brewmaster's Sausage Pizza.  Smoke House Burger: This thing is huge! My friend had to squish the buns and he still had trouble fitting the whole thing in his mouth for bite. He cut me a piece to try, and the burger was so juicy, paired with some crispy bacon and the cheese added a nice smokiness to it. Really good! It came with some thick-cut fries, (which I suspect were double fried?) that were so crispy! This burger is a solid choice.  Brewmaster's Sausage Pizza: This pizza looks massive when it arrives, but the crust is so thin and crispy that it's quite possible for one person (i.e. me) to finish. They're very generous with the toppings, which is great because all the toppings are delicious. The sausage on it's own is quite good, and you can taste a hint of beer in it. The caramelized onion and wort reduction add a sweetness to the pizza which is unexpected, but welcome.   This is a fantastic hang-out spot on a nice day if you can land a table. Definitely recommend coming though, just make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This definitely goes down as one o the best patios in the city. Right by the waterfront with a great view and excellent atmosphere...I could have stayed here for hours. I highly recommend a flight tour, with 4 different samples of beer. Blondes aren't really my favourite, so our waiter was kind enough to suggest some of the darker brews.  Food I would say was nothing spectacular...I ordered the wings. I do however seem to see good reviews on the burger options, which is what I will be trying tonight when I return!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual spot for dinner and Amsterdam BrewHouse was the perfect place.  The restaurant is huge, but still manages to have a nice atmosphere (impressive bar, and the fireplace is a nice touch), and the location is fantastic, right on the waterfront. There was a big Hockey game that night, so the place was packed, but fortunately, we got a spot at the bar.  I was impressed by the service, considering how busy the place was, I expected to have to fight to get a drink and some food, but the bartender was on top of it, checking on us regularly.  The food selection is nice, we had a Poutine (good) and a salmon Nicoise (the piece of salmon was quite big and tasted fresh, but the overall salad was a little bland.)  They have a nice selection of beers, and offer a few flights at a reasonable price. Lucky we found that place on a game night!"}
{"text":"Hoping that the miscues from my previous visit were an anomaly, I thought I would give Amsterdam Brewhouse another shot.  Everything started off okay. They seemed to be busy as usual with a packed house for lunch. After a brief wait, we were seated upstairs. Hmmm, they had lots of empty tables up there.  My dining companion ordered the Salmon Nicoise salad and I chose a pound of wings with the Thai Sweet Chili sauce. It didn't take long for the food to arrive.  My friend was happy with her salmon and salad, even though she added salt and pepper.  Unfortunately, just like my previous visit, my fork had crusted food on it. The wings had a decent flavour but they were a little overcooked and dry. One piece, in particular, looked like it might have gotten stuck in the fryer for a few cycles. It was noticeably smaller and darker than the other pieces. It was so dry, the bone snapped.I can't believe they put that on the plate.  At least the service was good but I have to call this Strike Two."}
{"text":"A good restaurant brewery bar in a relatively little choice area by the waterfront.  Strategically placed televisions provides a view of the current game no matter where you are sitting. If its warm enough, grab a seat on the porch out back by the water. Two levels of tables usually ensures that there is room when you arrive.    However, if you are placed on the wait list, make sure to go back and check. We waited for 20 minutes and when we asked about our wait list position, our number had 'disappeared'. We had be put back on the list and wait once again. They sorted it out quickly but it was an annoying way to begin the night.     The menu provides plenty of options for beer, with the flights being popular to try a couple of their personal brews. The food is the usual pub grub but made fancier. I ordered the only pasta option on the menu, and it came drowning in oil and not that impressive. I will stick to the beer options next time."}
{"text":"A friend had me try this place. Apparently the lineups are huge in summers. There was a teeny-tiny lineup even though it is not peak season. The Wine was good. Usual. The food was good....I had fish tacos. Dessert - the cheesecake was great! They brought a sparkler for my friend's B'day. The service was great!   The view is great. And if you are a Beer person, this is your heaven."}
{"text":"So, there are lots of mixed reviews of this place, but I notice that the particularly bad ones come from shortly after they opened, which might tell you something of the evolution of this place.   My experience was actually amazing and one of the best large group restaurant experiences I've had in Toronto.  I called in about a week before to make a reservation for 30 people for my upcoming birthday celebration. They told me that while their private room was booked out, they would work to accommodate my group in the South Mezzanine (upstairs). I was a little nervous, as I was making this booking without having been to the BrewHouse (but it came highly recommended from a couple trusted friends) but I made the reservation anyway. They require a $200 authorization for the booking, which only actually gets charged if you cancel inside of 24 hours. Fair enough.  We arrived and were promptly seated in our section, at a giant table just for us. We had a dedicated server and busser, who stuck with us the whole night. These two people went above and beyond in every way. Not only did they do separate bills for 30 (a crazy plan, but given that most of my guests arrived over the course of the first hour it was a way to keep everything on track) but they made sure we always had everything we needed. Our server even stayed an extra hour and a half after his shift was supposed to end, to ensure nothing odd happened if we transitioned to another server.  Our food came out lightening fast, so fast it actually kind of surprised everyone, our server included. The food was all great, with special shout outs for the burgers (veggie and normal), the wings, and especially the pretzels (just get them). We never waited long for drinks and generally just had a great experience overall.   Most of my guests had never been to the BrewHouse before but I know for a fact they will all be back soon. I've always loved Amsterdam Beer and am now sold on their BrewHouse too.   Well done!"}
{"text":"The patio is fantastic. The service is horrendous.   I was seated on \"the rails\" section and was told that a server would be with me in a moment. I guess their definition of a moment is broad and up to debate. As a former server and bartender at other establishments, I have a tendency to time my servers. From the moment I sat down to the moment I left the time was 24minutes of no one coming to me. I even did the arrogant and annoying arm raise when servers passed me and no one came to me. It was hardly busy (it was after 3pm, though the patio was slightly filled even though I counted at least nine staff members circulating the area). After 24minutes I left and passed the hostess who did not say a word to me. I've been scouting some restaurants and bars for a possible party, but clearly this place cannot handle one customer.   I wish I could comment on their beer on tap; it was the reason why I went.   Will not recommend or go back to this place again."}
{"text":"So we'd avoided this place since out first visit because the food and price were solidly \"meh\". But one night, we were tired and it was getting late so we figured we'd give it another shot. Walked in, was seated right away at a table with plenty of menus already on it. One guy came over quickly and took our drink orders which arrived a few minutes later. Then our friendly, but busy waitress took our order. After a not unreasonable amount of time, our pizza and burger came.   The pizza was blanketed in pepperoni which is good. The burger was also fine, but the bun wasn't toasted as requested. Well, I did say she was busy. We also had to ask for condiments which came promptly after our request. After our meal, the waitress was very apologetic for not being more attentive due to having 5 other tables to serve which was unnecessary since soother than the un toasted bun, she did a fine job.  In conclusion, there's still some minor service issues, but the food prices aren't as outrageous as when they first opened so we'll be back sooner than a year and a half."}
{"text":"@AMSTERDAMBH #YELPTO #PATIO #QUEENSQUAY  What's with the subpar reviews?! I think this place is fantastic.   First thing's first:   The Patio: Amsterdam Brewhouse boasts a beautiful lakeview patio. My first and only visit so far was for dinner, so I missed out on some sunny fun. But I can't wait to go back on a fine, warm, noon.   The Interiors: Surprisingly, just as nice as the patio. Industrial ceilings and walls with a dash of really snazzy decor.   The Beer: These guys brew some amazingness - fresh from the tank! I ordered the Sweetwater Squeeze Radler. A beer base topped with soda and blood orange juice. It tasted more like beer topped with Tropicana, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. My friend ordered the Raspberry Wheat. Both were \"crisp\" beers from what I know.   The Food: We both ordered burgers and no regrets. The burger made my top 10. It was tender and juicy, and not overcooked at the slightest. I ordered the Classic Ontario Brisket Cheese Burger and my friend went for the Smoke House Burger (total guy burger, as I called it).   The Verdict: I want to go back now. I want to go back soon.  Ankie Tip: The place is very \"datey.\" Take a date!"}
{"text":"Came here after skating at Harbourfront on a Sunday evening. Arrived without reservation with a large group and it was no problem getting a table. Service was friendly, though our server seemed a bit overwhelmed. Maybe they weren't expecting such a crowd. He didn't bring our 2 orders of pretzels by the time our mains arrived, but then offered to bring them for free, which was nice. They were really good! I had the Brewmaster's sausage pizza - pretty good and a great crust. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. Will be back when the weather warms up!"}
{"text":"The beers are phenomenal. I got a flight for $8 which was a great deal and all were delicious. The decor is very cool and reminds me of Ram in the states. Rustic and urban feel. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the food seemed unreasonably expensive. $11 for a Caesar salad without chicken? If you come just for drinks though you'll be good"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab some beers and food with your friends. I had the Raspberry Wheat beer and the Poached Pear and Goat Cheese salad with grilled chicken. I ate the whole thing--it was good :)  They have some interesting beers here so it's a fun place to try new things."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this lakefront patio restaurant is the wait to get in but trust me, stand in line no matter how long it takes. You won't regret it!  Their food menu is relatively small in my opinion, but they put a lot of effort into the food they provide. The appetizer choices are unbelievable, I highly suggest the Buffalo Cauliflower. For dinner try the smoked brisket dinner.. it's melt in your mouth fantastic. Despite being packed my food came within 15 minutes of ordering, it was a pleasant surprise.   The atmosphere is on fire inside and out. This place is great for sports events, there are a thousand tv's playing all sorts of stuff. If you're looking for something more tame grab a table or muskoka chair on the patio outside overlooking the lake. It's incredibly peaceful.   I'm not a beer drinker but I know the menu is incredibly vast with flavors to satisfy all tastes.  You need to try this place. Make a reservation and get your butt to the Brewhouse. The leftovers almost taste better than a fresh plate!"}
{"text":"Great location with a view of the lake.  I've been here in both summer and winter (once with my kids and once with girlfriends) and had a great time on both occasions."}
{"text":"Amsterdam BrewHouse is HUGE with two stories of space.  There is a lot of natural light and pretty views although we weren't right next to the windows. Just make sure you walk all the way down to the restaurant once you turn onto the side street.  It's behind a larger building.  We came by on a Friday afternoon to check out the beer and have some lunch.  I like that their flights are listed on a menu type placemat- although I would have preferred to chose my own, it was an interesting experience and all of my beers were very good.  We tried the meatball sub, which I've been craving for years, and the fish and chips.  We also tried poutine for the first time... I think the gravy threw me off but it wasn't awful.  Meatball sub was really good and the bread wasn't soggy- bonus for that.  Fish was so light and delicious, a perfect balance of batter on it.  I was kind of jealous my other half ordered it and I wanted to devour it all myself.  We tried the Front & Bathurst flight, and the Richmond & John flight.  We coordinated our choices so there was no overlap and we were able to try plenty of beer.  This was definitely a highlight of our trip to Toronto and we loved it."}
{"text":"I came here for a gathering with a party of 10.  We got to sit on the second floor with the comfy sofas and coffee tables which made it easy for socializing for a large group.  The atmosphere is nice and I'm sure it's even nicer during the summer when it's not all dark outside because you would get a great view of the lake behind the restaurant.    I tried their Smoke House Burger and was surprised how massive it was when it arrived. It's a classic cheese burger (double patties), smoked cheddar, bacon, garnished with crispy onion strings and a garlic mayo sauce.  It was definitely a heavy burger, but well worth the calories.  The side of fries was average, nothing special. There's also a large selection of beers to choose from and for those who are interested in trying different beers there's a sampler where you get 4 different beers to get a taste of 4 of their in house brews. The service here was average, nothing bad, and nothing outstanding.  I would come again if I was in that area."}
{"text":"Great location. Cool patio. Good beer.  But that's it.    Overall, disappointing. Menu is predictable and the food is underwhelming and uninspired. Horrifically noisy everywhere - dining room and patio.    Service is terrible.  They're either hugely understaffed or the staff is not up to the job.  Suspect the latter.  Party of three. Two food menus. Five drink menus.  Most of them kinda damp and wrinkly.  Two water glasses, water not offered to the third person.  Dining room untidy and no attention to detail.  Clearly no coordination between hostess/waitstaff/bus staff.  Had to go in search of cutlery, as there was none on the table and the girl who brought the food disappeared when asked for cutlery and did not return. Absolutely shambolic.  Would not return."}
{"text":"The food is edible but not great. I had wait one hour for them to serve chicken wings. I have a dairy allergy and there weren't many options other than one or two salads. The food was tasteless but the waitress was very understanding. The staff were very nice, but I would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Definitely has the best patio in this city.  The view of the lake on a sunny day is stunning.  Inside the restaurant is gorgeous too; super high ceilings, tons of natural light from floor to ceiling windows looking onto the lake, trendy decor, open kitchen, vibrant bar area.  Friendly, young, good looking staff. Our waiter, Peter, was great.  Helped us make our beer selections based on our taste preferences and offered samples.  Featured beer selection apparently changes regularly so always something new to try.  We shared fresh oysters, fish tacos, lobster rolls and the brewhouse soft pretzel.  Yes, they have tons of meat options, we just felt like seafood.  Lobster rolls extremely fresh and yummy.  Liked the fish tacos too, but usually prefer grilled rather than deep fried and breaded.  Pretzel is a must - served with grainy mustard and some sort of a maple sauce with a kick - so yummy with a pint.  Delicious sauces served with the oysters, some traditional and some surprising like the housemade citrusy aeoli. The place is huge, lively and gets packed.  I recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"Having just moved across the street earlier this year my wife and  i have eaten numerous meal with family and friends at the Amsterdam Brewhouse. Every dish is really god and I love the various beers and the option to drink samplers versus just one beer at a time. Staff is usually very efficient though the have had staffing issues throughout the summer. The only complaint I have is that it is hard to get a good patio spot on nice days - the place is always packed.  Matt, Erica, Tom, Erin, Vass and Alexandra (Alex) are awesome!!!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, which kinda ruined it for me.  Great location right on the water, food is decent and the beer is fine.  They offer beer flights, but will not allow you to customize (have to pick from prearranged pairings) which was a serious bummer for me.  Between the disappointing flights and service, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are bomb! If you like mixed drinks, I would highly recommend coming here.   The small downside is the service. Each time I've been here it takes a bit of time for someone to come to the table. Also the waitresses don't check up on you too often. It's not super bad, but wish they would come around more often to get a drink (especially in this heat)."}
{"text":"Other than the view, there is nothing at this place worth making the schlep for.    The beer?  Nope.  You can get great craft beer at many places in Toronto.    Oh the food.  Nope.  I mean, if you like 3 day old, rock hard baguette with your charcuterie plate, cold chicken wings and poutine that is just meh.    How about the service?  Oh HELL NO.  Over one hour to get the food, with excuses why the food hadn't shown up, rare check ins to see if we needed drinks and another 30 minutes to get our check (I will keep our waitress' name out of this).    There are a lot of great restaurants in the city.  Go seek them because this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Of all the places I ate or drank at in Toronto - this sadly scores the lowest - it's not bad per say just meh!! At the time of writing this I have been sitting here for 15 minutes - food all gone but plates stacked high, drinks all empty - just waiting to pay !!  Great location right on water and great looking place - service is beyond bad !! I am a 20 % tipper if not more but as I write this we are heading towards 10%!! Greeting was slow , drinks took 15 minutes to arrive ( it's not full today ) and beer is okay - not great !!  Just meh !!  Food again meh - oysters not chilled enough and not properly cleaned - had pieces of shell in every one ! Buffalo cauliflower really tasty but like warm - kids Mac  n cheese croquets also luke warm and pretzels had a weird clinal taste !!  I guess the location is the grab here as it sits on the water and to be fair to our waiter who is nice - I think they are just understaffed !!  Okay - not bad , not great - just okay"}
{"text":"food was good. location was also good given the waterfront.  but i took stars away for wait time.   We waited an hour for a burger and a salad... Its a pretty busy spot but thats waaaaay too long for that meal."}
{"text":"Beer is good food is OK, but just because you put a collared shirt on someone they don't get smart enough to operate a TV remote. They definitely don't magically learn how to manage or have any idea of customer service.  10 minutes cycling through channels so that the important part of a game is missed. Useless."}
{"text":"Great service, but horrible food. I had high hopes for this place, but our food (burger, ribs, fries) came out steaming, unusually fast and then lost their heat within 5 minutes. The actual bone of the ribs were cold so they must have been microwaved or heated up when we ordered.   The blood orange radler was really good though! I would only come back just for the drinks and the view."}
{"text":"I am only giving 3 stars because the food and drinks were amazing.. If I were to rate the service I would give service a mere 1 star. Our server Trisha, was an awful server didn't take out drink order till 20 minutes after us being seated. She Forgot to punch in one of our orders and did not apologize.. We had to constantly call others servers and server assistants to go get our server so we can order.. And finally she took like 11 minutes to bring our bills and we had to remind her. It was around 11pm and she had about 3 tables and she just seemed very miserable. She did not seem to enjoy her job... I am no expert but I suggest Trisha get another job.. Because she does a terrible job at serving."}
{"text":"Nice views. Food is just nasty. How can you go wrong with burger and fries? Never again"}
{"text":"Beer is okay. Good is pretty good. I had the brisket burger with yam frites. They were cooked well but nothing too exciting. The service is insanely slow, which were warned off by some locals before we went. Almost like taking care of the guests was an afterthought to the waitress and bartenders. Of you are set on going here it's okay, if you have choices...I'd pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service and good beer, but the sausage pizza was one of the worst I can ever remember having. Soggy and terribly sweet due to the \"wort reduction\", it was almost inedible.   I would go back for beers only because it is a nice restaurant on the water, but the pizza was appalling. Even Pizza Pizza would have been way better than that."}
{"text":"Flies buzzing around us during our meal. Flies buzzing around us at the bar. Friend saved me from drinking a beer with a fly served on top. Nice venue, but there seems to be an infestation problem. Ordered our meals, waited twenty minutes, then was told the kitchen we closed. At least the flies got fed, right?  Nice layout though. Pretty fly!"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party. Couldn't get reservations, but they said to try to walk in as they have a large capacity. We were a large party of about 20 people so I am glad they were able to accommodate us. It was a 40 minute wait, but I arrived 30 minutes ahead of my friends, so it pretty much worked out for us.  Staff: They were great and friendly. The wait staff were all nice and helpful. Food came out in a reasonable time for a large group like us. They even helped us take a group photo even though we were quite disorganized and had to wait for people to get back from the washroom. Overall, thumbs up!  Ambience: It's quite big, with a second floor. It's loud, so it's hard to hear. There's plenty of screens playing the games which was a bonus. At one point, they were willing to change one of the screens closer to our table to the hockey game.  Food: The food was pretty good. I had the Brewmaster's Sausage Pizza and Nova Scotia Crab Croquettes. Both were super delicious. The pizza was a thin crust and didn't get soggy and held it's shape. The croquettes were packed with crab and flavour, with the perfect crispiness on the outside.  Thankful to had found a place that could accommodate a big group. I'd come back again, but parking in the area is an expensive nightmare."}
{"text":"Radler was alright. Boneshaker was good. Food was meh."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger which was excellent. However ordered the apple tart for dessert and it was the worst I've had. They said it was made in house but it wasn't even warm. Plus no flavour. It's pretty hard to get an apple tart wrong, but this was genuinely terrible."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous view from this place! Wow.  We were a large group on a weekday afternoon this week and had an assortment of drinks, meals, snacks. The flights of beer were very popular. I had a couple of sangria a which were very good but then left with a disappointing finish of frozen or canned fruit at the bottom. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was a huge and filling snack.   Our specific server was very attentive. Oddly though other servers were confused by our numbers, made us squish up to take a table away that should have been ours, but then never came back to take the table.  Would definitely go back again for that view and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"What do you do when you have a six hour lay over in Toronto during the first patio day of the season? You find an adorable craft brewery and sit on a patio drinking craft beer of course! The wait list for the patio for Amsterdam Brewhouse was 45 minutes long, and it was gorgeous to stand in the line at the shorefront in Toronto. The actual wait was much shorter, and it was worth it to sit on the patio, watching all the boats and people on the shore.  We sampled their own craft beers and asked the servers recommendations for food. As we weren't in the mood for a meal He suggested we do some share plates: the crab cakes, soft pretzel and 3 amigos chips with 3 dips. What great suggestions! The soft pretzel was by far the favourite! So soft and delicious, served with a grainy mustard dip as well as a maple dip. I would recommend anyone stop by and drink and eat at this really cool and unique restaurant. Would definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"So, some friends of mine and Lee's were working for the week in Toronto, coming from Alabama. I said we should meet for a midweek dinner, and decided that this place would be a good place to go for good beer that's representative of Toronto, and in a location we could all meet at without too much hassle.  I made reservations, which I recommend even on a weeknight. The place was packed, very busy and with a lively crowd. We were quite early (I wasn't totally sure with the drive from Buffalo what time I'd make it,) but they were nice enough to seat us immediately.  They have a nice selection of samplers to choose from, since Lee and I are already familiar with their beers, we both went for one of the full pints. Our out of town friends got samplers, and I was a little bit dismayed to find that one of their popular beers (Downtown Brown) was actually not available! C'mon guys, get someone from the brewery to deliver some kegs. :D  We started out with a poutine, because we had to show our friends this delightful dish. It was a good poutine, with good fries and gravy, and good curds. Definitely a thumb's up from me, although it's rare that I meet a poutine that I don't like.  For mains I got the fish and chips, which was a little bit disappointing, kinda soggy with oil, not really all that awesome, but it was edible. Our friends got the brisket sandwiches, which they seemed to enjoy. Lee got the Brewmaster's sausage pizza, which he mostly enjoyed. Perhaps I just had bad luck in my choice.  Service was really great. Our friends with their deep Southern drawls charmed the pants off our server, who was very attentive and nice. I would definitely head here again for a beer and give the food another shot."}
{"text":"We were seated right next to the bus station, busy walkway, waiters broke 10 plates with shards flying into us. We asked to be seated at a different table, the waitress Ashely said we'd have to go out and wait in line again (15-20 min wait at the door). The most hilarious joke I've heard in a long while. Got up and walked out. This is not how you do customer service."}
{"text":"Server was super nice Poutine was pretty bad Raspberry Wheat was tasty"}
{"text":"This is a huge restaurant! We came as a group of 5 on Sunday afternoon, sitting out on the patio. The back of the patio is under shade which was really nice, very pleasant sitting right by the water. My partner and I got chicken fingers and fries (off the kids menu, $9, great value!) and some beers. Overall decent quality and value. Service wasn't great, we didn't see the server as often as I would've liked, but I think he did the best he could considering how busy it was.  Overall a good spot to stop for a beer and snack (as long as you don't mind waiting in line to get in)!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! I went into this establishment with low expectations, not that it didn't look inviting or because it wasn't busy. To the contrary it was exactly because of these qualities that I was suspect.   With its location on a busy waterfront promenade, this establishment screams of a tourist trap frequented by non-locals and serving up sub-par food for top dollar. I couldn't have been more wrong--at least about the food.   I can't speak to how touristy it is, hell, I was a tourist and went there mostly because it was convenient to the hotel. But the food and the beer was undeniably excellent.  Firstly we had the soft pretzel which was top notch. If you have read any of my reviews you know I fancy myself to be a soft pretzel expert of sorts. This was a top notch bread twist. The sweet sauce that came with it was forgettable, but the course mustard was perfect. We also had the buffalo cauliflower which was the best I have ever had.   The chicken wings were huge, plump and delicious. For dinner I had the green curry and while it was not as good as what you might get at your favorite Thai joint, it was a solid rendition that I very much enjoyed. I did not taste any of the good other entrees but my compatriots had ribs, barbecue and a burger and they were all very happy.   The beer was also great--but when isn't beer great!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Sat right by the water with a group of 6.  Wait staff was fast and attentive, but I am writing this review based on the best cauliflower buffalo wings I ever had.  I also had the pretzel bites.  OUTSTANDING and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The location of this place is so wonderful. I have been here twice and I have to say that drinking a margarita and looking onto the water is blissful. The inside is very well done and trendy, the patio is great with individual chairs for looking out on the lake and plush sofas for groups.  The place gets packed by dinner time, I came on the off hours but when I was leaving the line to get in was ridiculous.  The beer is obviously the star of this show but I came for the food. The first time I came here I got an odd dish with meatballs and egg, the second time I got a sandwich and creme brulee cheesecake! The cheesecake was great, the drinks were great, the atmosphere was great but the food was just meh and that is where this place looses it's points. Both times I have not been impressed with the food, it was dry and flavorless, my least favorite combination. The menu was pretty basic but with every option came a beer pairing, that was neat.  The service was good, waiter was friendly and earned a great tip! I would really like to love this place but I would not recommend dinner here, just drinks, dessert and soaking in the view."}
{"text":"Wasn't a massive fan of the food at this place. The craft beers were fun and they let you taste the beer in a 4 oz glass before you decide which to get. Go here for the drinks, and not the overpriced meal."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Sept 7/14. All in all not bad. The reason I gave it a 3-Star vs a 4-Star is they charged $1.00 for extra dipping sauce!? We ordered the \"Yam Frits with Garlic Aioli dipping sauce. We're cooked like I asked but came with a minuscule sauce. So I ordered an extra. Out server \"Bobby\" (very nice/polite young guy) delivered the sauce but didn't mention the extra $1.00 until the bill arrived. I don't think restaurants should charge so much extra for something that just a part of doing business!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, both times I've been here.  First time, they lost my reservations and were going to question the validity of my reservation and I had to pull up my conversation log of who I spoke to.  They eventually squeezed us in somewhere.  The second time, we didn't have reservations but the restaurant was quiet.  They refused to seat us together upstairs and said it was closed - understandable, but they were rude when we asked to pull up more seats.  They said they've given us all of their seats, when clearly there were more seats elsewhere.  The waitress also refused to allow us to have separate bills.    They have a wide selection of beers, some of which is seasonal.  Beer flights are also available for those who want to try a little of everything.  The food is good, and I like the cheddar dip, which is made with beer in it.  It has an interesting taste.  The pizzas area also good and pairs well with the beer.  One other thing to note is that they do not take reservations for the patio."}
{"text":"Good beer. Food is average+. Best place on the lakeshore for sure. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with a party of 15 for a birthday dinner. Booked at least a month in advance, requesting the patio, but the patio was apparently full. Settled on two long tables in the back, which was still fine, as we had a nice view of the harbourfront.  About 8 of us arrived first, filling up the first table, and literally 5 seconds after we were seated, we were approached by a floor Manager(?) who curtly informed us that if the rest of our party didn't arrive within the next 10 minutes, he was taking our second table away. Wow, WHAT?  Considering that the upper floor of the restaurant was COMPLETELY EMPTY at the time, was that really necessary? (And it wasn't blocked-off for a private party, as only a few people seemed to be seated there over the course of the night.)   The Manager then REPEATEDLY walked by our table for the next 10 minutes, eyeing our empty seats. We ended up spreading ourselves out across both tables, until the rest of our group arrived about 15 minutes later. Anxiety from being watched and monitored by impatient, pushy staff is a GREAT way to start an evening!  Our server was friendly and attentive enough, but seemed inexperienced and clueless. We were told that they \"don't do separate bills\" for groups of over 10, as \"it gets confusing\" and that processing the different credit cards will \"take too long\". Uh, what?  An absolute big load of crock, as the reason they don't want to split the bill up is so that they can slap-on an automatic 18% gratuity on the bill (a rule which I understand is necessary sometimes, but none of us were actually informed of ahead of time. More on that in a moment.)  I explained that a friend and I had to leave early, so I asked for a separate bill - he told me that I could \"just leave cash\" behind and let my other friends \"sort it out.\" We said we had no cash on us, which he then pointed to an outside ATM. Seriously, guy? Can I just PAY how I want to PAY? He eventually relented, and let us have our own bill.   After my friend paid with her credit card, it was only AFTER she realized that the 18% gratuity was STILL ADDED to our total, even though it was only for the two of us, AFTER she had already given him an initial $10 tip!! So basically, our waiter earned a $20 tip from a $60 bill.  Yeah, it's ultimately our own dumb stupid fault for not checking the bill more closely, but if a restaurant is including an automatic 18% gratuity (and for TWO people?!) it's common courtesy to at least TELL DINERS ahead of time.   The food itself is nothing to write home about: I ordered the duck confit poutine, and it was swimming in so much lukewarm off-yellow gravy that everything was mushy and soup-like. YUM. Oh, and the one food item EVERYONE raves about at this place - the deep fried Oreo cookies? They've been now taken off the menu, as informed by our server. *SAD TROMBONE*  The only reason this place gets two stars is for the venue location, and for the beer selection and quality. But I think I'm even being way too generous with that."}
{"text":"View is absolutely the best!  We were watering on the upper deck with a perfect view of the expensive boats coming in to shore.  Food was good - actually much better than o was expecting for a beer joint with such an excellent view.  Our waitress was hard to find and didn't check in with us - so no refills on drinks/beers  which was a bummer....especially when that is why we ate there.  Overall the view won me over!"}
{"text":"This place has a wicked patio and cool atmosphere but I honestly don't think it's anything special. When we got there the line up was packed for the patio so definitely prepare to wait if you really want to sit outside. My friends and I got a table inside and ordered drinks while waiting for other friends. Our server was super friendly and bubbly and gave us recommendations on the menu.  My friend and I split the brisket burger (thought it was dry and lackluster) and wings. The wings are pretty standard but just came with celery and carrots. If it wasn't for being near the water, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here since you can get Amsterdam brews pretty much everywhere in Toronto. Friends definitely came here to be near the water and that didn't disappoint but the quality of food could be better."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times had great experiences with the food. However, I had a bit of trouble today with my reservation. We were running late and I called them but I didn't specify how long we would take. When we arrived, we were told our reservation had been canceled -- that being said, we did still get a table without any difficulty. I would guess that a grey Saturday at lunchtime isn't the most in-demand hour there.  We were a party of four and we ordered to share. For appetizers, we had the pretzel (after reading all the great reviews on Yelp about it!) and sweet potato fries. Both were slightly smaller in serving than I had anticipated though they proved to be good sizes -- any larger and we would have run out of room for the mains. They were served fairly quickly after we ordered, and we enjoyed them alongside the Richmond & John beer flight, which is four varieties of beer (5 oz. each).   For our mains, we shared the swordfish, the pizza, and the ravioli. The ravioli was definitely more on the heavier side, with a creamy sauce and saut√©ed mushrooms, some greens, and sundried tomatoes on top. I thought the butternut squash had a great sweetness to it and it balanced out the very strong flavour that the sauce and mushrooms provided. The texture of the ravioli was also done just right -- not too soft and not too hard. The sundried tomatoes were among the best I've ever had -- incredibly flavourful! The pizza had a thin crust, though it was a bit overdone near the edges and on the bottom. The toppings were prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, tomatoes, and sauce. I thought the pizza would have been better had it not been so baked but generally the toppings were a good mix of flavours and not overwhelmingly greasy. The swordfish was lightly seasoned, topped with a coarsely chopped fruit chutney and served with coconut rice. It definitely offered a good complement to the rest of the meal in terms of flavours.   We ended the meal with the tartufo and the lemon merengue in a jar. The tartufo was as expected -- rich chocolate gelato paired with a strong raspberry gelato. It was served on a sauce -- we couldn't identify what was in the sauce -- and I found it a bit too much actually. The lemon merengue was a layer of crumble at the bottom, lemon custard in the middle, and merengue on top. The merengue was a bit heavier than I expected, but still delicious. It tasted closer to a marshmallow in consistency than a lightly whipped merengue. I would definitely recommend these two desserts, though it is true that the lemon merengue in a jar is quite small for the price you pay.  Overall a great food experience. The waiter was friendly and was just pleasant to talk to! If it hadn't been for the reservation experience, I probably would up this rating to 4.5 stars. Considering there aren't many (relatively) affordable restaurants around Harbourfront that serve consistent, quality food, I would recommend stopping by Amsterdam Brewhouse for a meal."}
{"text":"Great view of the harbour.  The place is very spacious and has a great atmosphere.  I got a flight and a few other things to snack on.  Favorite beer: Boneshaker"}
{"text":"This place is pretty big and is a busy option for drinking along the waterfront at Harbor Place. It's nice that they have their own brews but the burger was below average. I recommend the local 416 beer though as it is light and not heavy."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Upon arriving, I was told it would be a half hour wait for outdoor seating. I put my name on the list and was told I would get a text when the table was ready. I sat at the bar to wait. The bar tender was very attentive and friendly-only positive. After 40 minutes I asked the hostess how much longer it would be. She told me my name is no longer on the list but she totally remembered me. She said the kitchen was backed up and she was not allowed to seat anyone but as soon as she was allowed I would get the first table. She asked me where I was sitting so a hostess could get me when ready. 30 minutes later I went back and asked how much longer. I was told it would be a bit more. When I was told that I walked out. I was completely mislead and wasted over an hour for nothing."}
{"text":"The place has a great atmosphere and the views of Lake Ontario are lovely as well, but I love going down to the Harbourfront area. My mom and I decided to wander in and try this place as we were curious. Great choice! Our server, once we were seated, was so nice. I wish I could remember her name. She made some great menu suggestions but we decided to start with the deep fried cauliflower. I ordered the sweet Thai chicken wings and my mom had the lemon chicken. The cauliflower was delicious. The wings were great. Good size, meaty, juicy and the sauce was a little bit sweet and spicy. Just the right combo. I didn't try the lemon chicken my mom had but she had said the chicken was delicious, the lemon flavour not so overpowering like at some other places. I did try the roasted potatoes and the rapini. They were cooked perfectly. The rapini had some crunch and the potatoes were done perfectly. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and so yummy! To drink I tried the sampler of 5 light beers. Again, the server was so helpful with this because I'm not much of a beer drinker. The raspberry beer is awesome. Definitely my fsvourite! If you're ever in the area check this place out. There are 3 lines: one for the patio facing north, one for the patio facing South and lake Ontario and the 3rd is inside. We ate inside but we'll definitely check out the patio next time."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere; nice decor; Worst server Ever. Our Server, Emily, was consistently unfriendly, uninterested, and made the experience a regretful one. Otherwise good food."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. They clearly are not Toronto proud and should be ashamed for threatening lawsuits on other Toronto Brewhouses.  Sad and I or my friends will ever be back."}
{"text":"As much as I love their craft beer, its not enough to have me return to this establishment.    The place is huge and amazing location, right on the lake front.  The muskoka chairs on the patio are a great touch for people that want to sip beer and watch the world walk or sail by.  But that is where my good experience ended.  Visited early on a Friday afternoon, decent sized group with the intention to eat/drink the evening away.  When we arrived and told them how many in our party, the hostess looked offended that we didnt have a reservation (only 6 of us) and that we would ask for a table outside.  Given how early in the day it was, their patio was empty.  After being seated (we did get on the patio eventually) we got down to the business of sorting out our beer selections. They have a decent offering and have pre-created some flight recommendations. We tried to order some flights but 1 or more of the flavours were out of stock. We asked if we could just substitute or create our own flights out of what they had available ..... that caused mass confusion and eventually we just gave up and ordered pints of what was available .  Disappointing given the reason we had gone was to taste their various beers.  The food was average.  Burgers were large, fris served on the side (in their own cup) with garlic aioli. It might have been good - but none of us tasted it as it had that crusty film on the top that condiments get when sitting out for too long.  A few people ordered sandwiches or appetizers - anyone that didnt order a burger had a LONG wait to get their food.    Getting refills of water, napkins or anything really once the food was served was impossible.    Seeing this wasnt going to be somewhere to stay and drink for the evening we asked for the bill.  I will say they were great to give us seperate bills. the downfall is that their terminals for credit and debit dont work on the patio (something about the brick walls of the restaurant block service).  So settling up  took a good 30 minutes.  Noone in our party will be back, which is a huge shame. Amazing potential, amazing location, amazing beer (usually), but poor execution."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday evening and sat on the patio. The outside atmosphere on the water is enough for 5 stars. The restaurant was busy but we got sat within 20 minutes. My friends and I wanted to try a flight of beer each (we're no beer experts FYI) and our server suggested the Richmond & John for light beer drinkers. Both my friends opted for that and enjoyed the KLB Raspberry Wheat Beer. I felt like exploring a little and tried the King & Portland flight. I enjoyed it and would probably have the Downtown Brown again. For food we shared the buffalo cauliflower bites and two orders of the fish tacos. The cauliflower was awesome and the tacos were good but a little messy to eat. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Was too crowded to wait for a table. All I wanted was to try the beer anyway, so I went into the store attached to the restaurant. Restaurant has a great location on the water. I'm sure outdoor dining or drinks on the lake must be nice. But again, I was just there for the beer. And with 3 kids and husband not willing to wait for a table, I hit the store. 3 beers only cost $8, that's a craft beer bargain anywhere. Brought them back to hotel to enjoy, and I did! Bought variety: Cruiser All Day Pale Ale (loved), a Blond Ale that was a little bitter for my personal taste and Boneshaker IPA, very tasty.  Only speaking about the beer, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I would go here to drink or nibble again instantly. I love the space, and the location on the water, and when breweries are combined with restaurants.  One of the reviewers called the beer selection \"dismal\" because they mostly carry Amsterdam brewed beers. Uhhhh it's the Amsterdam BrewHouse, I'm not sure if you knew that or not? haha The beer selection is really varied, as you've got your lighter beers, and your IPAs, stouts, raspberry wheat. There should be a beer for everyone here. I would recommend the Flight Tour samplers. If you are looking to get smashed on the cheap go for the Leaside flight tour as it has the higher alcohol content. I would definitely recommend the Fracture IPA though... very tasty beer! Also, my friend got the sangria and it looked mighty tasty, so if beer isn't your thing there is always that.  I grabbed the poutine when I was there, and got it with the duck confit. If I got it again I wouldn't get the duck confit as it wasn't as shredded as I expected, and it came off a little rubbery. Overall the food there is overpriced. This place would do huge business I think if they modeled themselves off of some of the brewhouses I have been to in Portland. Cheaper eats, and a happy hour, and this place would be 5 stars probably, but they seem to be catering to a higher clientele or just trying to pay off their probably ridiculous rent on the water.  Looking forward to trying it again. Has four star potential."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Saturday and the wait time took about 40-50 min. Aside from that, I couldn't complain about anything else. The brisket burger was so good and you definitely have to try one of the sampler beer choices they offer. Canada can do beer well!"}
{"text":"Came in for a flight and a quick bite to eat. The food was fantastic. I ordered the poutine and the Ni√ßoise salad and my sister got the pulled pork sandwich. We cleaned both of our plates!   I also ordered the flight with mostly IPAs and enjoyed all their beers. The only thing I didn't like about the flights is that you couldn't mix and match... I don't want to necessarily try 4 IPAs... I want to try beers of many different styles :/"}
{"text":"The honey butter bbq wings were phenomenal!!!! OMG! So  glad we stopped in to get some shade! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Nice beer over here I really enjoyed the tasting round! My BBQ pizza tasted great and I had a good time."}
{"text":"Great patio on the water, and always a great selection of house beers and seasonals.  Also, love the pretzels!  One of my favourite summer spots!"}
{"text":"First impressions are everything and Amsterdam does not make a good first impression. We approached the hostess outside and were asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside. No HELLO or greeting. Ok. So I said either were fine and she just had no idea what to do with me and pointed me to the other side of the building to sit on the patio. We went around, saw the line, and came back. She then pointed us inside.  So I don't live in Toronto but I don't think that the restaurant culture is very different from Chicago. It would be kind of standard if a hostess greeted you, told you about your seating options, SMILED LIKE A HUMAN, and generally made an effort to make you feel welcome. None of that. That hostess could not be bothered to do her actual job.   Food was fine, the radler I had was good, the inside of the place is nice. But Amsterdam REALLY needs to consider who is outside representing them."}
{"text":"Very cool brew house and sports bar. The bar area has a bunch of TVs as well as the back bar and upstairs seating areas. Unfortunately, we were seated in the restaurant area which only had limited views of the bar TV. This was a bit of a negative but that was about it.   The beer selection was really good having several versions of different craft styles, and also offering draft and/or cans on several varieties. Side note, most of the draft beer at my hotel, the Westin Harbor Castle came from here. That was a cool bonus. They also had some unique takes on classic drinks. I'm a big fan of Bloody Caesars, and make it a point to drink them as often as possible while in Canada. The rest of the year I have to make myself at home. Here, instead of the traditional Old Bay rim, they used seasoned roasted beer malts. Interesting.  The food was pretty good. Got the large soft bavarian pretzel. It came with a stone ground mustard and then a special house dip made from wort, maple syrup and caramel. Absolutely addicting. Almost wanted to get another pretzel just for that. We also got a lemon chicken schnitzel and a chicken and brie pizza. Neither was spectacular, but both were very good."}
{"text":"Liking the new brew house!  We took the tour and had a bite to eat here before the Jays game and it was worth every second.  The tour guide was friendly and down to earth.  We learned a lot about the brewery's history and the brewing process.  Then we were promptly escorted to our table by some of the friendliest and accommodating staff in the industry.  Wish we could have hung out in the muskoka chairs on the patio facing lake Ontario.  Next time!  Sampled a few flights and had one of their fresh salads.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This evening we met friends for supper at the Amsterdam BrewHouse.    It was snowing and cold when I got there so it was nice to sit by fire.  Gord ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich.  He said it was good.    I ordered the Smoke House Burger (without cheese) and it was delicious!  I would definitely it again!    Michelle was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a hot new restaurant with an awesome patio in my neighbourhood so I invited a friend from out of town to have dinner and drinks there.  It's a good thing we can laugh at the whole thing.   1. We waited in line OUTSIDE for over an hour with no host/hostess service 2. Once a table was ready we were told it would be about an hour wait for food (we waited so long that we said sitting right on the water would be worth it) 3. Once we sat at our table it took approximately 20 minutes before someone even cme to get our drink order 4. But once we got our food...it was AMAZING!!    What a shame that such a fantastic location, with great beer and great food has such major kinks in their operation.  This place has amazing potential but I think they may have opened way too soon with inadequate staffing numbers and now a large number of digruntled patrons as a result.  I will return for sure because it's my neighbourhood restaurant with a tasty menu but they have got to get their act together or this 3 star review will turn into a 2 star."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome customer service our server Gina made us feel welcomed and recommended great choice for beer pairing with the food menu definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends at Amsterdam Brewery we also had a lovely view of Lake Ontario to add on to our experience. Our Waitress Gina was also very nice. Would definitely go again. I enjoyed the American Burger along with a Beer flight in Richmond & John"}
{"text":"This place is in a huge building.  The ceiling is 2-3 floors high.    There are booths and tables.   Very large, lots of room.  Excellent for group lunch/dinners.    The menu has a pretty good selection.  I had the seared tuna sandwich for lunch.  Very good.  Also had a beer, also very good.  I typically am very picky with in-house breweries.  You also have views of the marina.  I'd have to give this a 4 based on service, decent beer, huge open restaurant, decent menu, and  the view."}
{"text":"Good beers nice atmosphere warm and friendly staff food was adequate not understanding I would go again just to have a nice relaxing dinner with friends or family"}
{"text":"Meh, not my favourite brewery. It is huge and very impersonal. I came here with my sister to try some beers. The place is HUGE. It would be great for large parties. We wanted to sit on the patio, but unfortunately, it was pouring rain so we sat inside at the back bar. The chairs were comfortable. There were no hooks under the bar. Service took a bit long, especially just for beers. There was a lot of staff and the place was decently full. $7.50 or so for a 20oz pint of beer. My sister had some carbonated blueberry thing (cider?) on tap. It was disgusting imo. Didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that.  Washrooms were a bit gross and most missing locks. There was a fan blowing in it, I guess because it was so humid, but the cord was in a puddle of water which I stepped on.  I wouldn't suggest this place, but I also wouldn't be opposed to going again and checking out their patio."}
{"text":"Good beer and decent pizza couldn't save this terrible experience. (Although they were out of one of the beers in the flight I ordered, similar to other reviewers.) I received the worst service I have ever had in Toronto. I've lived here since 2005, so that's saying something.   The transgressions were all passable initially. Despite telling the staff that I had no phone and my friends were coming to meet me, no one told my friends who arrived looking for me that their dining companion may already be there. I found them at the bar after I went searching for them when my waitress told me she was to busy to check with the hostess ( fair enough).   Our waitress was nice and I have no complaints.   Where it all went south: we were on the patio and it started to rain. Our server asked if we wanted to move inside. We said sure. I offered to settle the tab before we moved. She thanked us and charged us for our food and beer. A manager brought us upstairs and sat us. Where we were left for an hour.   After 20 minutes of everyone around us being served while waitresses explicitly avoided making eye contact or acknowledging our lifted hands, one of my friends managed to throw himself in the aisle to ask a waitress if he could order a drink. She said she would find our server. 20 more minutes go by. Nothing.   My other friend found the manager who sat us and asked him if we could be served. He apologised and promised to send someone. 20 more minutes go by. Everyone around has already been served and paid. When the last table in our vicinity had paid and no server had even looked our way, we decided to leave.   The worst part: we approached the same manager who sat us to let him know how ridiculous the experience had been. He apologised. No mention of \" we could serve you now\". Just \" I'm really sorry\" as we walked out. He misunderstood my friend telling him about the server my friend had asked to find our server so he could order a drink. The manager looked at him and said \" You never asked me to order a drink\". He was rude, gave no remedy and snapped at my friend because he misunderstood him.   I will never go back. We tried to ask a server and a manager for help ordering in a section where we were placed by the manager. No one helped us and when we pointed out the terrible service, we were treated rudely and still not offered service."}
{"text":"Its an ok place if you get the patio, kinda dont like you only can get the beers they make.  I had the brisket burger and it was two patties and had good flavor, found it kind of dry though.  I would personally explore other options if in the harbour front area."}
{"text":"After taking a trip to Toronto's islands, we wanted a beer and a small snack.  We found this brewery and decided to try it out.  We got two different flights ($9 each) and shared their pretzle.  Their beer here is delicious and so many different options to choose from. My favorite was their Brown Ale.  Their pretzle is perfectly made and their sauces were yummy - a honey sweet sauce and a grainy mustard. As a pretzle lover, I super enjoyed this one.  The environment was fun and busy - beautiful view of the water.  Staff was friendly and service was quick!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent food, great apps and drink selection. And it's right by the water, what more can you ask for :)   We had crab cake (A) sweet potato fries (A+) , sushi (c) , cauliflower (a), Ontario burger (c).   The brunch Caesar was awesome! It was like a meal :) with meat, shrimp, asparagus."}
{"text":"Wow, that view. So, rule number one: ask for a table on the patio.  This place is massive. We came for lunch and the patio wasn't open yet. Fail. They sat us at a table near the windows, so it wasn't a total loss. Beer-wise, I had a Raspberry Wheat and a Spotted Cow Fieldberry. I'm a light beer girl and these were great for me. For eats, I ordered a dozen of oysters. They use Rodney's Canadian, I opted to split it half east coast and half west coast. They were $3.25 a piece. Personally, I usually only will do $1 oyster specials when I'm out, but I figured since I was in Canada that I needed to try these. Love the fresh shredded horseradish that came with it. I also got the hand-cut poutine. The gravy on it was delicious.  If you're in the area, this is a great spot for drinks and to enjoy the water views. Don't forget to 'gram it.  I mean if you didn't post it on the IG, did it even really happen? :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay and the service was fine, however the line was so long. Didn't worth 45 mins wait."}
{"text":"Four of us came here last Sunday after the Becel Ride for The Heart & Stroke Foundation so we were really hungry.  Although the restaurant was huge, the place was packed and very busy on this sunny beautiful Sunday afternoon. The indoor seating, and both the outdoor front patio and the outdoor seating by the water in the back were full.    I ordered a glass of wine and the Brown Butter Lobster Rolls: \"3 lobster rolls with apple fennel slaw, brown butter aioli, snap peas, fresh terragon\", with a side of \"simple salad\".   I have had lobster rolls before at different restaurants and know that lobster rolls may seem small.  The bread was delicious and very fresh, and overall, the lobster rolls were tasty.  I did enjoy it a lot more than the lobster roll I had at Rock Lobster and would order it again.  For dessert, we shared the Hand Held Lemon Merengue Pie in a Jar: \"home made lemon curd, hand whipped merengue\".   It definitely had that home made quality but it was delicious!  Would order it again next time.  Our server was friendly and attentive during our entire meal, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is lively with beautiful views of the waterfront.  I wouldn't hesitate to eat here when looking for a restaurant at the Harbourfront and will return since I live in the area."}
{"text":"Well run place. Staff are super committed to customer service. Patio over the water is very very nice. Food is good and a lot of options. And of course a fantastic beer selection. Got to see for a tourist. For sure."}
{"text":"The events here are always something else and over the top. We came for the NYE carnival which had performers, cotton candy and old time carnival games for attendees which went over real well. The space is pretty great for events like this but for the most part, its a dining and educational experience for sure. The menu here really does reflect it's brewhouse flair with focus on complimentary foods that go well with most beers for the aficionado or budding cicerones.   This is a great casual place to support local brewers and have a nice time doing it."}
{"text":"Came on a rainy afternoon before dinner for a few flights and a few snacks. The ladies liked their sangria and all the guys loved our flights of beer. Big place, two floors actually with plenty of TVs. We had raw oysters, were OK and two pizzas which were tasty for snacks. Wish we were hungrier for a full meal but overall cool place on the harbor front but hard to find if you don't know what exactly you are looking for."}
{"text":"Great fresh food made in house with tasty home made beer. Great IPA amazing amber pale ale and now for the food. Fresh oysters  yummy crab cakes and delicious chicken Parma"}
{"text":"This place is perfectly located if you're hanging around downtown sightseeing, taking in a concert, or heading to a Jays game (Rogers Centre and ACC are both about a 10 minute walk away, give or take a couple minutes). My boyfriend and I always get a beer flight so we can sample a few different brews, and wait staff is always knowledgeable about the beers on tap. The pretzel bread is a good choice to split with friends, and I couldn't stop thinking about the Buffalo Cauliflower for days after having it the first time. Even though it's a huge location, they get pretty busy if the weather's nice in the summer or if there are events going on nearby, so you're better off making a reservation. The waiters can be a bit obnoxious and slow, hence 4 stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently went here. There was a lineup! It was super hot out so people were hoping for shade. The staff seating people were rude about people asking for shade. When I looked on the patio there was many seats with shade. Plus a massive covered area that also had open air. It was confusing to me why asking for shade on such a hot day was a big deal. We were seated under the covered area which was great. Our waitress came and took our drink order and had brought one of our beers and kept coming back saying the other one was on it's way. I had practically drank all my beer by the time my boyfriends beer arrived. Definitely should have gotten it free. Our food came out and walked past us as the guy made his way down the bar to ask who it belonged to and then he made his way back to us. Our burger was not hot nor longer fresh after its tour around the restaurant. As I sat and observed this was a beyond regular experience. Staff looked at a chart and often brought food to the wrong table. When we were clearly done it took forever to get the bill let alone the machine. Our waitress looked busy so we asked another one for the machine and he asked who our waitress was and informed us he would let her know we were ready, why couldn't he just bring us the machine? He wasn't doing anything. Overall a very poor experience and we were happy to get out of there."}
{"text":"First some context. We went on a Saturday evening, arriving at 6:30 p.m.. There had been an afternoon Blue Jays game, we knew it was dinnertime and it was raining. We had expected at minimum a 30 minute wait to get in.  When we arrived there was a lineup to wait to get inside just to get on the waitlist. We were told from where we were it would be an hour wait. This was not a problem, we were happy to wait and as it turned out we only waited about 30 minutes to get inside.  Once inside we checked in for a table and went to the bar. There was one seat so my wife sat and I stood behind her. We were served in a reasonable amount of time.  We noted it was quite warm and noticed many people around us wiping sweat from their brow and folding up the placemat menus to make fans for themselves. It was uncomfortable at best.  Now we didn't go to the Amsterdam Brewhouse for food, we went for beer and that's where this place took a nosedive. About half the beers listed as on tap were offline. A few of them were available in cans but we had come to sample a flight or two of draft beer. Unfortunately we were out of luck.   We were seated upstairs and the warmth factor ratcheted up to 11. It was uncomfortably hot upstairs. We asked our waitress and she did her best to empathize but clearly she was uncomfortable as well.   We ordered a burger and fish and chips. The food was okay but again, it is all we wanted from this place - okay food and to sample different beers.   TO SUM IT UP: On any other night, this place would earn the 3 out of 5 stars its averaging. But on this night, when you wait an hour only to find out half the beers aren't available (that's something the outside hostess might say \"It's an hour wait and half our beers are offline.\") and the uncomfortable temperature inside it gets a 1 out of 5. We spent less time eating and drinking than we did waiting.   POSTSCRIPT: Restaurants owned by breweries shouldn't have problems delivering their own product to you."}
{"text":"Place looks nice and had lots of tv's so it was easy to catch the leafs game.  Food was okay.  Small portions for what you pay but the premium is from its location.  Wouldn't go out of my way to come here, its a big restaurant/bar, nothing too out there."}
{"text":"Had 2 tasting flights and the beer wasn't spectacular. Pretzel was good, but the veggie burger was not. If not for the stellar location and redeeming pretzel this would get 2 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing location, beautiful renovation of this historic space.  This brewhouse is huge!  With a great set of screens to watch the game and nice decore.  I was very iimpressed with the space and the waterfront view is fantastic.   The wait staff were knowledgeable about both the beers and the menue.  My wood oven pizza was fantastic and my date loved her fish and chips.   I was impressed by the menue itself and can't wait to try more!  I had a couple different specialty craft beers which were delish,  annd everything was really reasonable.   Bottom line, go for the amazing location and venue but stay for the tasty food and good beer."}
{"text":"We had Caiti - amazing server! Excellent beer for craft beer fans. I'd recommend getting one of their flights, and am certain your server can recommend one to match your beer preferences, but would recommend you try some of the beers they make in-house. Food is a little pricey but absolutely delicious and portions are generous. A Toronto favourite!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor. Bartenders were friendly as well as attentive. They have a good selection of beer on tap. I had the spotted cow which is close to a Belgian pale ale, loved it."}
{"text":"3 Stars for Patio Views; 2 Stars for Service/Food   VIBE  The addition of this massive brewery and patio to the Harbourfront is no small feat, I'm sure. It's nice to see something modern -and did I mention there's a huge patio? The views of the lake from the front patio cannot be beat!   There's plenty of space - 500 seats inside and 300 on the patio. I love the Muskoka Chairs and the view is a nice respite from the hustle of the city.   That said, service needs to be improved, especially when serving food. On a non-busy lunch day, I saw servers bring the wrong dish to about 3 different tables, including ours. Food menus should already be on the table, if they're that busy. I had to ask for one -- and that's with both the attention of a server and a hostess. Ouch!   WE ATE/DRANK  Let's start with the positive: the drinks are great. $5 Amsterdam Blonde? Yes, please! Light and refreshing.   I had heard about the mediocre food reviews and well, it's spot on. The lobster rolls were just way too mayo-y. It's also not a big portion (three mini lobster rolls and a small container of chips or fries for $17) for the price. The roasted veggie with goat cheese pizza was a step-up but compared to other pizzerias in the city, subpar.  I hope they can improve the menu, in time.   I'd come back for a brew tour, though.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Meant for brews and views."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday last night.   Security at the door was a total asshole. We walked up because they were already seated in side and the man fully crossed his arms and walked towards us like we did something wrong. On top of that my other friends all had an issues with this security when they were trying to come in.  The lobster rolls and the beef dip were a huge disappointment. Lobster rolls were just gross and the beef dip was made with gravy?? Had the pretzel to start, I didn't mind that however I minded the dips that came with it.   I ordered a sangria and it tasted like pineapple and gin.   The only reason I'm giving it a three is because of the waitress. She looks like that girl from pitch perfect as she was amazing for our table."}
{"text":"Not even going to spend the energy and time to draft something detail. In summary, rude and irresponsible hostesses that doesn't manage their guest list fairly and efficiently. The shaded part of their patio is unbearably loud. Never coming back again :)   And the last time I was there, burnt burgers. You be the judge consumers."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and we were really looking forward to our visit, however it turned out to be a disappointment.  Half of the beers were unavailable (!!!), service was extremely slow and the food was mediocre.  Won't be coming back as there are many better options in the area."}
{"text":"After a long day exploring Toronto I took my family to the Amsterdam BrewHouse for dinner. The location of this restaurant is amazing, right on Lake Ontario in the heart of the Toronto waterfront. The space occupies an old boathouse and has a small on-site brewery.  The inside is very large and offers multiple levels of dining. I really enjoyed the open aspect of the old building and appreciated being able to see into the kitchen and brewing areas. Though the weather wasn't too nice during our visit, there is also a large outdoor dining area.  The bar area offers numerous seats and plenty of televisions. I especially enjoyed seeing playoff hockey on every screen, something that you just don't see back home in Cincinnati. I enjoyed the Boneshaker IPA as well as the Downtown Brown.  To start our meal we ordered something the entire family would enjoy, including our two preschool aged children, the Boneshaker Cheddar Dip served with toasted pretzel breads and pickled vegetables ($13). The kids enjoyed the pretzels just as much as I did. The pickled veggies were all for me, and they were also very good, though not recommended for dipping.  My wife and I split the chicken and brie wood oven pizza, which also featured white sauce, mozzarella, smoked bacon, baby spinach, and roasted garlic ($18). The portion was large enough for two and we still had a couple of slices leftover. The slices of brie were very generous and the toppings all paired well together.  Our entire family had a great visit to the Amsterdam BrewHouse and I would definitely return anytime I find myself back in Toronto."}
{"text":"i've been here 7 times. it's a great place to just hang out, especially imo in the winter.  for me, the service has always been good. friendly. perhaps a little slow.  the food is okay. i'd avoid the sweet potato roll like the plague, but everything else is fine. it's a step above regular pub fare, but it's not haute cuisine either.   the beers are nice."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I can honestly say that I've had a fantastic time and have really enjoyed the food they've served here. I've had their pizza and sandwiches, and while it wasn't mind blowing by any means it was still pretty darn decent. The food and drinks are a bit more pricey than other places in Toronto, but for what I would expect for harbourfront fare I felt it was reasonable.  The service here has always been very friendly and helpful. They seem to know their beers quite well and were helpful in giving recommendations.  I absolutely loved the atmosphere here, which is surprising considering how large it is (aka. how many people could potentially be shoved inside). But I found the tables to be well spaced away from each other and the low lighting made for a really nice romantic experience during a snowy night.  I can honestly say I didn't run into many of the complaints that other reviewers have touched on in this review. I've been to this place twice during December and January, and the service and selection were consistent during both visits.I can imagine this place being less enjoyable during the summer rush, but it still has a nice charm to it that would be there year round.  I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"I really like Amsterdam Brewhouse, even though for me it's quite a bit out of the way. There are decent beers on the tap, ad the food, even though not mind blowing, are good pub type dishes that goes well with beer.  It can get packed on the weekends so reservations are recommended. There are frequently 1000 point tables on OpenTable if you don't mind eating a bit late or early."}
{"text":"Horrible service and waitress times. Good atmosphere.    Took forever for a simple burger.   Average food."}
{"text":"This place is huge! It has a lot of seating, bars, table tops, tables inside and outside. My favourite is sitting by the waterfront in the back. Great music and a wonderful atmosphere before a baseball/hockey/bball game. There menu is delicious. The best app would be the Korean tacos, they are delicious, rich in flavour and very filling. The schnitzel is a perfect choice for an entree, very tasty and has some zest to it! I would highly recommend this place for food quality, atmosphere and fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great location and good beer!  Food: both of us got burgers. They were okay, my boyfriends burger was incorrect. Was supposed to have brisket on it but it didn't. Mine was good and both of our fries were great.  We went there around 7:00 on a Saturday and had a 35 minute wait. Was nice to sit by the water while we waited.  Once inside there was a nice atmosphere and a large tv to watch a hockey game.  Server was very nice, though he was busy and we could tell. He never brought us napkins and when we asked for more water he said \"its gonna be awhile, just being honest.\""}
{"text":"We enjoyed our evening at this popular, waterfront brewpub. The restaurant is massive and decorated beautifully but the food is a bit average and overpriced.   What's really great about this place is firstly, the location. Overlooking Lake Ontario, this is an amazing summer venue for having a drink and enjoying the view from their massive patio, or if you'd rather be indoors, the floor to ceiling windows allow you to still take in the view. Two levels of seating and a patio make this a huge restaurant, however going on a Saturday night without a reservation left us waiting for a little over an hour for a spot on the patio.   Popular among tourists, the prices are definitely reflective of that. We got a couple appetizers for the table; the brussel sprouts and the buffalo cauliflower. These were around or just under $15 each which is a bit pricey for some vegetables and sauce. The buffalo cauliflower was really delicious though and creative, you almost think you're eating wings instead of cauliflower. They were crispy and sauced to perfection. Some of my friends enjoyed the Brussel sprouts but I didn't see the appeal, maybe I'm just not a brussel sprouts kind of person. For dinner we shared the half chicken, nothing stood out as particularly delicious. The chicken had good flavor and was juicy, the portion size was also decent, but again, I won't be dreaming about this meal. We had a couple of beers as well and they have a good selection as well as recommendations for food pairings.   Our server was really friendly and charismatic. He was prompt and everything came out quickly and efficiently. The only other thing was that servers came up to us about 5 or 6 times with food we hadn't ordered, there must have been some type of communication issue somewhere, as we kept having to turn away other people's food.   I probably wouldn't come back here on my own but I wouldn't hate coming back because the atmosphere and restaurant are really cool. I'd probably just stick to drinks though and avoid the touristy pricing!"}
{"text":"This place is just solid. Nice place and great location right on the water. It can get crazy busy in the summer (naturally) but the staff and managers still do their damnedest to meet the demand.  Some people complain that once in a while their third pint takes a little longer to come, so here's my advice: step 1: politely remind your server or a manager (they have walkie talkies on the ears) 2: stop being an entitled little millennial priss.   Another tip: if you come Sunday evening, which is unfortunately my favourite time to stop by, it's luck of the draw if you want to try the seasonal \"adventure\" beers like the delicious Oranje Weiss, as they tend to run out.  So listen, it's a brewpub, meaning that you can't go in there expecting the food to be white glove level exquisite, BUT they do have some truly interesting selections. The pizza is wood oven. Yup, actual wood oven. Not nearly good as, say, Pizzeria Libretto, but that's like comparing gold to platinum; they are two of the same thing (metal) but totally different in every way. Still the pizza is quite tasty. Other than the pizza, they have actual entrees, like the swordfish with fennel, the Scotch Egg, ravioli and so on. Ambitious but still not too bad. My latest visit had me trying the wings with ghost pepper suicide sauce. My dining companion thought they were so hot that she was playing tonsil hockey with the devil, but I could have gone a little spicier. Still tasty, so don't mind me; i'm just a masochist when it comes to capsaicin. Of course they have burgers and they're tasty, but let me stress something: $7 for pints of hand-crafted beer by the water! Boom!  Great place to catch the game after a long bike ride (plenty of bike parking outside) with your friends. What really sticks with me each time, garnering a 4-star review is the sincerity of the service. Everyone from the hostesses, the managers, and servers wants you to have a good time and feel taken care of, and that counts for a lot."}
{"text":"I must admit, this is my favourite brewery in terms of beers so this is slightly biased from that. In fact I'm sipping a Boneshaker as I write this review! The menu is great, and puts a large scale spin on on pub food. This place has some amazing wings and barbecue, and the entire menu has beer pairings which is FANTASTIC. Personally I choose what kind of beer I'm going to drink and then select my food based on that... I guess that shows what my priorities usually are when I'm at Amsterdam Brewhouse! The staff is also very friendly and energetic and pay the right amount of attention without being ever present.   When you're looking for a brewery experience, especially for people visiting Toronto... this is where to go!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times in the summer but went the other night (December) for dinner and drinks with some friends. A really big and airy space with friendly staff and great service. We ordered a lot of food and everything was great. We are all still talking about the Buffalo Cauliflower... definitely get that appetizer! The beers are obviously a hit and the list is extensive."}
{"text":"Used to go to Real Sports Bar for my trips to Toronto to have a few beers and a meal. Needless to say I won't be going there again. Unparalleled service, food, and drink at a more than affordable price. I had the Brisket Burger that was cooked to perfection and went well with the paired beer. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and we had no complaints. With reasonable prices, exceptional service, and outstanding food and drink, this place cannot be beat. If you don't mind waiting, sit outside and enjoy the incredible view of the Toronto waterfront."}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice place with a decent atmosphere and deck but they need to get their act together.  Staff gets 2 stars and I'm only giving it 3 stars because i understand that they're just getting started and they have decent food and beer.   First time i went there was an hour wait and we were told that it was ok to go sit at the bar. While walk to the bar the manager jumped in front of us and said \"where do you think you're going?\" I replied that we were told to go to the bar and he said that we weren't allowed because the seats were reserved. Very condescending and rude. I shouldn't be scolded by a restaurant manager because he's not properly directing his staff.   Second time i went here we got a table and the food was very good as well as the beers. Our server was a bit forgetful and not well trained. When we left the restaurant was only half full but there were about 40 people waiting in line outside...the host never told them that there was a separate host stand for people who wanted to sit indoors. She was the outside host and neglected to ask anyone what their seating preference was. We informed everyone in line that there was plenty of seats inside and another host stand, upon which half the line got really mad at the outside host and stormed inside.  Again, very poorly trained staff.  I'm also confused by the upstairs portion of the place. It's always wide open and seems to just be were the staff hangs out and hides from customers.  When there's an hour wait for a table, why don't the open the upstairs? There's plenty of table and chairs waiting to be utilized.   Give this place a few months and maybe they'll shape up. But until then, only go on off hours and expect the staff to be clueless."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars right across the board. Excellent location and beautiful view of Lake Ontario, great selection of beers and food (you really have to try the Nova Scotia Crab Cakes) and beers brewed right on site. I found the food and service excellent and will definitely be back here. Its a great place to take your family during the day, or a fun place for a date or with friends in the evening.  For me this is a fun cool hip place to have a drink or dinner."}
{"text":"This spot is amazing for their location right on the water, their brew selections, and their amazing food.  I came here with a group of friends on vacation. Two beer flights were ordered. I personally didn't like the beers because I like my beers dark and heavy and the flights were light beers which taste like water to me.  Buffalo Cauliflower was ordered to be share among us and it was really good with the ranch or blue cheese they served, I don't remember which one it was.   I got the Smoked Brisket Dinner which was a 12 hour smoked AAA Brisket and came with brussel sprouts, creamy slaw, and buttermilk cheddar cornbread all on the side. Phenomenal. This is definitely something I'd recommend getting if you do come here for dinner. What they serve you is more than enough and it tastes very heavenly. I somehow finished everything and suffered through a food coma.  The waiting service is excellent. Very helpful, tentative, and liked cracking a few jokes left and right. It just made the whole dining experience a lot better which is how this place earned the fifth star in my books."}
{"text":"Was in town for the Jays game with my girlfriends, we wanted to have a nice meal on a patio before the game. Oh did the brew house deliver, we sat at a lovely table on the patio which we only had to wait 15mins or so for, an extremely reasonable wait time if you ask me. We all decide to try the \"blonde\" beer and we all enjoyed it, and for a 10oz beer the price was perfect. We each order dinner I had the southwest BBQ chicken pizza and it was very good, super thin crust allowed for finishing the entire pizza myself. One of my girlfriends also order a pizza and Brie and chicken pizza and she thought it was great as well. My other girlfriend order the brisket cheeseburger and thought it was very good. Overall we thought the price was completely reasonable for a restaurant on the Harbour Front in T.O   Our only complaint was my friend who LOVES Caesars thought it was a little small for its price point. Overall we all loved the experience and would definitely return to the brew house."}
{"text":"First things first; this place is usually crowded and popular, you should expect a queue when you arrive, especially if the weather is nice. The back patio has an excellent view, however it's usually really noisy due to planes landing on the island. Multiply this with the noise of the crowd, you get yourself a very loud night out.   But the service is really friendly, the staff is attentive. They have a Great vibe.   The food is good too, especially the Yam fries. I however ordered Thai green curry chicken and found the portion size a bit small. I knew I should've ordered a burger or some wings.   The beers are OK. I wish they had some high alcohol beers and dark beers too. Boneshaker IPA is so far their best brews if you ask me.   A pleasant place to spend time with friends, nice beers and good vibes."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto for a date night with the wife and decided that we were going to go Amsterdam brewhouse for dinner. It was a nice sunny day so expected it to be busy. Wait wasn't to bad roughly 45 mins by the time we got in our seats. Wanted to sit on the patio overlooking the water but that line up was a lot longer and we were hungry. The atmosphere here is absolutely amazing.   Service was great from the time we got there till the time we left. We were unsure what to have so we ordered a bunch of appetizers.  Would definitely recommend the boneshaker cheddar dip and the yam frites. Both were really good. Chicken wings were good but nothing overly exciting for the price. Extremely disappointed with the 3 dips and chips. Chips were good but the dips were mediocre at best. Not a big hoppy beer kind a guy so I tried the Richmond and John samples (lighter beer) the 3 speed was good and the blonde was decent. Wasnt a big fan of the raspberry beer but then again not a fan of raspberry anything. There wild card was spotted cow and it was ok but had a little hoppy taste to it. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone. I truly enjoyed my evening here and followed up with a walk down the water front to end our evening."}
{"text":"A great idea. WIth great potential. As of this week, ultimately disappointing.   With a beer selection as fantastic as they have here, why can you not create your own flight? I cannot believe this. I was insulted to see that, in a sampler, I had to drink the beers that THEY choose. As a beer lover, I wanted to drink samples of the beers that I love, not the beers that they chose for me.  It's the \"walled garden\" of beer tasting.  My wife, wanting the awesome Oranje Weiss, was forced to drink a sampler with beer she didn't like.   Anyway, I was surprised by the beer selection here. They have more beer offered here than in Amsterdam's actual brewery! Fantastic  We went there after opening day so that we could avoid all of the service disasters, but our nice waitress still seemed pretty aloof.   Finally, our ghost chili wings were not spicy.   I'll come back in a year and hope that the restaurant is run as well as the brewery.   The Fracture IIPA is really good."}
{"text":"This place is at the best location that you could get in downtown. Right in front of Ontario Lake on harbour front and view is great from here. What better place to celebrate Birthday than here. Huge place and great to be out with friends. Staff is amazing and helpful. We ordered pizza which was perfect and burgers were great too. Huge selection of drinks and they brew there own beer so best place for hanging out and party."}
{"text":"There is no doubt the venue and location are Great. Sitting right on the lake, this is the place to be on a nice day. We went to the side entrance and found a table on the patio. Admittedly it was very busy for a Friday afternoon. Service was TERRIBLE! The waiter seemed overwhelmed. He took our drink order and returned for food order. We asked what oysters were available...he wasn't sure. Said he would let us know. Our meal was ok...not spectacular...just average. Unfortunately after giving us our meal, we never saw the waiter again. No drink refills, no update on oysters, no inquiry on our meal, no dessert and no check. We actually had to go find someone to bring us our bill. Sad...i wanted to like the place but service was not good."}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about this place. My family went there 2 times in a day. First time we just needed to use the \"washroom,\" (in Canada, it's called washroom instead of restroom.) we politely just ordered drinks. The staff knew we were just going to use the washroom, but they still gave us full service. Later we went back there for dinner. We ordered 4 things, chopped  salad, baby ribs, crab cakes, fish taco. Only crab cakes were mediocre, the other three dishes were beyond expectations.They were super fresh and well-prepared. The flavor and presentation were just right.  Again the service was great. Glad to come across this place during our visit in Toronto."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are visiting from the States and heard great reviews about this place.  We were originally supposed to do the brewery tour but we were late so we just decided to have dinner here.  After waiting 30 minutes in line (we understand it's a busy place), we got seated at a high top under the covered patio.   We have been sitting there for almost an hour and quite a few workers have walked by.  No one bothered to acknowledge us.  Finally I asked a waitress if I could ask her a question.  She brushed me off and continued on her way.  After 20 more minutes, a lady who turned out to be the manager, asked us if anyone has been over.  We tell her no, we've been here for an hour, trying to get peoples attention but everyone just keeps walking by.   She said someone would be right over and someone finally came over.  She went over the menu and beers with us and then said she'd be back, but of course after having waited over an hour before we got acknowledged, we put in our order right away.  Who knows when our waiter/waitress will get back to us!!  We finally got our water after an hour.  I've never been to a place where I had to wait for over an hour for the waiter/waitress to come over.  This is just  ridiculous!   Update: Our order was completely wrong.  The only things that were right were our drinks and appetizer.  Pizza was the wrong one, but still delicious.  A plate of fries came out all by itself.  After 20 minutes, I asked the waiter if my burger was coming.  Turns out it was never put in.  And when we did get it, it was cold.  The food and drinks were good, but the service was horrible!  Thank goodness we did not pay full price!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, the selection of beers, but I chose to get poutine and it wasn't the greatest. I understand this place isn't known for their poutine but I wish the fries were thinner, cheese softer, and more gravy. Other than that, staff were really nice and it's a great location. I would come again."}
{"text":"Went here twice over the Canada Day weekend (don't ask).  Overall, it's an absolutely beautiful and large pub, you could throw some seriously huge parties here.  The back deck is nice, unfortunately not too many of seats are directly lake facing, but they have a row of Muskoka chairs set up to enjoy the view, and lots of tables along the side of the venue and front. The interior seats 500 apparently, and outdoor 325.  Being brand new and so huge, they obviously still have to work out a lot of the kinks with service - I won't go into detail, but it was a bit of a nightmare getting seated at our table, and the initial wait for drinks was a bit long - but not ridiculous. Food took exactly 22 minutes after we ordered.  The menu has a nice selection, I felt it was slightly overpriced even for gastropub food. My friend had a $15 burger, which was actually quite tasty, served with fries. You have to pay an extra $2 for salad. Most mains started at $16 and went right up to the $32 range.   Beer selection is a bit dismal, as they really mostly carry Amsterdam Brewery products. They did have a few samplers where you get 4 mini pints for $8, which was a great way to sample a few different beers.  Our server was actually very, very good. Could be upgraded to a 4 star when they get their service straightened out."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The first one, we went Sunday night and we were able to seat right away inside. I like the interiors and the ambience, not so loud music where you can chit chat with your family and friends while eating. But, the second time we went there it was Sat night and we wanted to seat in the patio. And I think we waited for about an hour to be seated and we are not even by the lake we are just in the table near our line. Lol. Good thing is We did not wait too long for our food to arrive. I think it just took them 5 mins maybe.  The burgers are really good, tender and juicy. The fries and poutine were a little bit salty. I ordered the pizza too and it was ok, I kinda like it because it is thin crust. The flight is really cheap for $8 I think for 4 different beers. Overall, I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Was scared by overall rating but since it was by our hotel, we checked it out. Glad we did. Sat on the harbour and watched planes landing on Toronto island and enjoyed the boats. Our waitress, Alex, was outstanding! She was friendly and knew the menu inside and out!  The beer was excellent.  I enjoyed a flight of their craft brews.  The pretzels were great and I enjoyed the burger. A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Had a few beers, roasted chicken with barbecue sauce and swordfish. Good place to hang out just on Lake Ontario. Open till late, goons service, decent food and good drinks. Will come back again when I am next in Canada. Cheers"}
{"text":"Terrific waterfront and fun vibe. The menu was creative with brew flight suggestions.  Our waitress Tayler was adorably lovely too. The Brussels sprouts are a must!!"}
{"text":"Great location by the lake!! Awesome patio to hang in the summer and the ambiance is pretty slick.  Pretty huge and nice staff that help you in the beer selection. But, definitely on the premium side. Per person expense would be $30-35."}
{"text":"This is an awesome menu. To have nonfried fish (hard to find at a pub) and Quinoa! I loved the nice change from standard bar food. The beer menu is very easy to navigate too. The inside is industrial looking with lots of TVs set up on the walls."}
{"text":"Their beer was amazing. I got the Raspberry Wheat beer which tasted like a Yingling  with raspberries. My boyfriend got the Imperial IPA it was delicious as well. Bartender Shane was very hospitable and great at pouring beers. I would definitely come here again to try their seasonal and special brews next time."}
{"text":"Crowded venue, unreasonably long wait, frustrated hostess and grumpy guests made this place a surprising disappointment.   I could go on but I think that I've hit the highlights. Too bad."}
{"text":"Nice location right off the lake. I am sure when it is warm out it is nice to sit out on the patio and have some beers. Really close to the CN tower and aquarium.  My favorite part was the beer flight. They have 4 different flights to choose from all $8.50. I enjoy trying different beers when I travel so when flights are available I get excited! The best out of my flight was boneshaker, would make it a regular beer of mine if I could find it.  I ordered the summer ravioli and was not a fan. I felt like it was missing sauce or salt, just lacked in flavor. I snuck in some fried, which were nice and crisp.  4 stars for the beer, 2 stars for the ravioli."}
{"text":"Buffalo cauliflower is a must order! The beer, wings, location and decor is great. Other food we had was on the bland side. The bathrooms are filthy with clogged & dirty toilets. When we let them know on the way out, instead of apologizing, the hostess got huffy and insisted that they were cleaned every 15\"; NOT cool."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Gorgeous view of the lake, cute chairs and blankets, yummy burgers, and a live DJ. I even came here to celebrate St. Patrick's day last month and had a great time.   However, it seems as though the reception is handled by unprofessional hostesses who make old customers feel very unwelcome. I'll tell you why I say this. We came down here at a semi busy time, but from what we checked, there were plenty of empty tables both upstairs and on the patio on both sides of the restaurant (The restaurant has 2 different entrances). We were greeted by a hostess who told us that the wait time to get a table is about 30 minutes. When we told her there are plenty of empty tables, she said that there are people ahead of us on the waiting list, when clearly there was nobody around waiting to be called! As a matter of fact, we saw a guy who came and told her that they never called his name and he got angry when she said she had called his name and there was no response.  My boyfriend did not like her attitude and neither did I. We ended up sitting at the loud bar, instead of the more spacious area upfront.  Now, I'm not going to ignore the fact that the waiters are very good at their job and that I like their food and beer. That's why I'm giving them a 2 stars instead of 1. You see! A terrible hostess with a crappy attitude can change the whole game."}
{"text":"This place just doesnt get any better does it? We went back saturday night with friends around 12pm hopign to just go to the back patio...but we tell the security were okay with inside. The security guard (like he owns the place) demands we wait outside...so we do... the place is litterally EMPTY inside. We wait 10 minutes as he litterally just stares at our group 6 . So were annoyed with the fact that this was going on and that the place was DESERTED. We should have left but instead we went through the back around the building and low and behold we got into the empty patio. This place is a joke. Were not coming back. Fool me you, shame on me. Fool me twice shame on me. FAIL."}
{"text":"I went here on a beautiful Saturday night. Great atmosphere, good friends and good beer.  Sadly the awesomeness stopped when it came to dinner.  I had the 'Ribs from the Smoker' priced at 26 dollars.  I haven't had worse ribs in Toronto. The ribs were charred, dry, chewy and they tasted awful. If it wasn't for my own lack of willpower to send the ribs back I would have stopped eating at the first one.   I'm not exaggerating when I say I've never had worse ribs in my life. Please avoid wasting your money.   To be fair, presentation was great. Waiters and waitresses were accommodating. I've had food at the brew house before so i'm not reluctant for future visits but i'll never waste money on the ribs again."}
{"text":"Considering the ambiance, location, and prices at this place you would expect a lot better service and quality wise.  I came for my friends birthday on a Saturday night and we were there for three hours. Yes, three hours. She made a reservation and when we arrived, the table wasn't ready yet. We waited a half an hour just to be seated, despite having her called ahead.  When we were finally seated, it took another half an hour to get our drinks brought to us, and another half hour to put in our food order. The place is very very clearly understaffed, as the server knew what he was doing, just didn't have enough time to do it all in.   Once we all got our food, the three people who had ordered fries all had to send them back because all three orders were cold. I had the Summer Ravioli, which was good but considering the price, unimpressive taste and size wise. My friend beside me ordered a Poached Pear and Brulled Cheese Salad and was also unimpressed with it considering the price.   Once we had all finished eating, it took ANOTHER half an hour just to get our bills and pay.  It really is a beautiful location, it just needs to be staffed more appropriately. On a busy Saturday night, there really is no excuse for cold fries."}
{"text":"It's a large bar/restaurant that feels a bit plastic/suffocatingly corporate, but they have an enormous outdoor patio overlooking the water, which is hard to beat. Friday night around 11, the crowd was sparse, likely due to the chilly temps, but we grabbed a tasty coffee stout and grabbed a seat overlooking the water. Real pleasant."}
{"text":"The bartender was incredibly rude. The food was bad and the beer was mediocre. Service was almost non-existent. Took 10 minutes to grab the bartender's attention."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out.  The space is huge and I can only imagine how nice it is in the summer when the patio is open.  Of course the beer selection is great, but there are also other drinks for those who aren't into beer.  The food menu was huge and everything looked tasty.  We went with the buffalo cauliflower bites which tasted like crispy chicken bites.  They were incredible!  The sweet potato fries were on point as well.  Great spot, but a bit out of the way!"}
{"text":"Place is huge, and the ambiance is great. We were in town and wanting somewhere to hit lunch on the water. It's Halloween so needless to say the place was decked out. Some of the holiday decor was well-placed and fun, others seemed a little juvenile. Waiter was extremely knowledgeable and honest. I love when people take the time to tell you with brut honesty things they do NOT like on the menu. In addition to suggestions he made sure to let us know an item or two that weren't his favorites. We split a beer since they're 20 ounces and they pour them in separate glasses for us. Had the pretzel appetizer, it was salty and filling. Split a burger and chicken lettuce wraps. We enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"Great location, great beer, great food and amazing views!  One of the best spots in the city to get together with some friends. This was the first time I had eaten here, as last time I only came for late night drinks.  And BOY was I pleasantly surprised! ...almost regretful that I had not eaten here before.  FIRST OF ALL - THEY CARRY RODNEY'S OYSTERS... and they were divine! They are $3.25 each - whether you choose East Coast or West Coast, so these were very fairly priced.  I opted for East Coast, and oh my gosh - they were impeccable.  I even had my friends who had never tried oysters try one - and they were hooked. Definite must have.  Also, another new item menu is the Mexican Street Corn.  This is one of my new favourites! It's a roasted corn, covered with Coriander Mayo, Fresh Lime, Chili dressing - it was phenomenal. It's a little messy, but it's cut into 3 sections for you.  I'd highly recommend it.  I also picked up the Hoisin Chicken Lettuce Wraps, but it was very underwhelming - this is the reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5).  However, others at the table ordered the Chicken and Brie Pizza (which I thought needed a little salt in the dough), but redeemed themselves in their thick cute french fries and yam fries.   Overall, the food was great.  I've had the beer here before and it's great, so I opted for the Frozen Sangria with Red Wine, and that was delicious, fruity and very refreshing.  The line to sit outside, with a waterfront view was 2.5 hours, and inside, 2 hours - to be sure to plan accordingly on beautiful days/nights in the summer! I am not 100% sure if they take reservations."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a few beers and watch a game. Their beer selection is extensive with something for every taste, and food is very decent. The place is super clean and comfortable, with lots of large TV screens all around. As far as food, I only tried the fish tacos, and they were excellent. Just the right amount of spice and very tasty."}
{"text":"Location location location!!! That's how it's getting it's 3 stars. Great concept and on the lake. The girls that sat us were super friendly... however they don't do wait list, so I had to sit there and physically wait.   Now the server was a super sweet heart, but our order wasn't perfect. I for one do not eat beef, so I requested the veggie patty be used for my nut brown, and I'm a cheese lover so I expected cheese and but it wasn't on my burger and I still had to pay for the nut brown  :(, my other friend ordered a salad with the dressing on the side that was a no go. Dressing was smothered all over. Thier menu lacks an omph and very minimal.   I think if management could do one thing- really push the customization to  your server. She was nice but very unsure of a lot of things.   I'd go back for the patio and the view"}
{"text":"Our server, Nathan, took care of our large group of 11 so amazingly! He was attentive, always filling out glasses and checking in on us, and had an incredibly contagious personality that put all of us in great moods. Definitely would recommend the restaurant and think our server was one of the best! Thank you Nathan!"}
{"text":"This brewery/restaurant is located by the harbourfront, so, they are always busy when it is good weather out. The lake view from top floor patio is the best. This restaurant is good for small to large group. I would strongly recommend to make reservation otherwise you may need to wait 1-2 hours for table. You can either try small portion of different house brew or just go with your most favourite kind. Food is not the best quality which is understandable since it is after all a bar/pub. Also, i noticed they lack of good service. There are paid parking nearby if you decide to drive there. Overall i give 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"After being coerced into coming here by persistent extroverts, I was happy I humoured them.    Ok, ok, the review.   Really busy, good busy, place. Two levels of beer fun. And I love beer.   Outdoor seating is available and surprisingly, our group of 8 was able to snag prime seats without reservations on a Friday afternoon. #winning   Obviously, for starters you need to order beer. For indecisive people, get a sampler. If you know what you like, go ahead and order that tankard.   Food was passable, not amazing but not horrible either. Just...there. But it should be noted that the portion of fries for burgers sucks, as in, minute.   Minus two stars for the fries because I also love fries.   Anywho, beer was great and service was actually great (contrary to the horror stories).  Just don't go there starving."}
{"text":"Really like the beers they brew at the BrewHouse, Blonde and 416 Lager are 2 of my favourites. The food is very good as well, the burger (smokehouse) is one of the better one's I've had, I order that whenever I go.   In the summer, the patio is amazing especially before or after a Jays game. It has a nice view of the lake and patio chairs to just relax on.   I'm a fan! Will come back lots!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??  Their beer flight! Comes in four different combinations, each flight comes with four different types of beers they serve at the brewery. Each flight costs $8.50. I generally like the vibe here because it's facing the lake and you can sit at the patio enjoying the view of the lake as you sip on your drink and enjoy some food. The bar is relatively big too so if you don't want to wait in line for a table at the patio section but still want to sit outside, opt to sit at the bar. You can still face the lake and have a glimpse of people sitting at the patio too. In terms of food, I wouldn't say it's the best, it's okay. We order the marguerita pizza that supposedly used a wood burned oven. I thought it could have been cooked better especially the crust. I thought it was rather soggy and soft and the pizza didn't come out pipping hot so the cheese was solidifying by the time it got to our table. However I would still recommend the pizzas that they say came from the wood oven or the smoked ribs from their cherrywood smoker - food that you can't find typically in another bar or brewery!  LAST TIP?   Expect long lines if you want to sit by the patio, especially during the summer months however the lines go relatively fast. If not, opt to sit in the dining area because it's a big brewery or sit by the bar where there is no line at all and can sit you faster!"}
{"text":"The Amsterdam Brew House has great drinks and a nice atmosphere if you're looking for a large patio. The food is nothing special, I felt like I was wasting my money on something I didn't even like.   The crowd is mostly tourists, don't think I'll be jumping at the chance to go there again."}
{"text":"Location is great, right by the waterfront with a great view. Get there early for the patio as the line tends to get quite long. We went around 645 and didn't get a seat until 8.   Our server was slow and did not provide adequate service. My buddy ordered a beer and did not come for 45 minutes. We initially sat outside and after waiting forever for our drinks, it got chilly, therefore requested for a seat inside. Our request wasn't actually made until 30 minutes later.  The food was actually quite good. I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was quite flavourful and not dry. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  My buddies ordered a pizza and a chicken dish which looked wonderful.   The inside seating is quite spacious with multiple large TVs for sports games - which makes it a good sports bar to go to when the game is on."}
{"text":"Amsterdam is a beautiful space, with an amazing view of Lake Ontario. However, it may not be the ideal place to bring your boyfriend when he's meeting your parents for the first time.  We went on Saturday night and it was packed to the rafters. There was a party going on at a table beside us, and they literally sang Happy Birthday and presented a cake...twice!   Regardless of the fact that I could hardly hear my parents speaking - the evening was lovely and the food was great. They had these huge floor to ceiling doors open onto the patio, so there was a fantastic breeze coming in from the lake.   Personally, I love the beer selection. They have a large menu of all the beers - local, domestic, fruity - you name it, they have it! This made for a great conversation as well. My boyfriend initially just ordered water (wanting to look responsible he revealed later), however he then ordered a beer, followed by another.   My mom and I split a delicious pear salad with goat cheese and spinach which tasted amazing. We also split a fabulous pizza. Between the two of us, it was the perfect amount of food. My dad ordered the \"kale and friends\" salad which we joked about, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken wrap. He said the wrap was sub-par so I wouldn't recommend that. However I would recommend ANY of their salads. They're to die for!  Overall, it is a great place, however I am giving it a three because it seemed semi-chaotic, and the service was slow. The waitress was absent most of the night which is better than being overly aggressive or annoying, but still not ideal."}
{"text":"Smoke House Burger. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Hands down. I had it with the Radler (Blood Orange Beer with house soda so it's really light). Highly highly recommend. Will be back. A lot. :)"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! Our server was funny and polite and the food came out very fast too.  Huge restaurant, lovely views of the lake, and all in all a fabulous time.  Tried several of their beers and their pizzas and burgers were awesome.  Really enjoyed it here!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good...however...they charge three bucks for a small spoonful of parmesean (probably faux) cheese. Get real! Every other restaurant on the planet asks is you want that for free. Beer gets an A+."}
{"text":"I have been to location twice and I have had two different experiences.  1ST EXPERIENCE I visited this location on a Sunday.  It was busy and we still had great service.  The hostess kept is updated with the table status.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartender was attentive and nice. We waited about an hour and than were seated.  We were hungry so we ordered almost everything.  I had the poutine, pear salad and the margherita pizza.  The poutine was exactly how a classic poutine should - lots of cheese and gravy.  The salad ultimately made me fall in love with a pear dressing.  It was a perfect medley of tart and sweetness that was savoury.  The pizza was delicious - thin crust and fresh toppings  OVERALL 1ST EXPERIENCE Very good!  2ND EXPERIENCE The tone of the service was different. The hostess was polite and attentive. The servers on the other hand was not very excited and dry.  The sunny day kept our spirits up.  I had to order the poutine again. I was not too happy about it.   The fries was slightly stale, the gravy wasn't hot enough as the cheese curds were still solid.  The cheese was not stringy.   For the main, I had the Montreal Smoke meat Sandwich.  It tasted great, the meat was not salty, so it paired well with the Dijon sauce.    OVERALL 2ND EXPERIENCE I would still return, but I would just make sure I make clear requests."}
{"text":"Moderarte busy for nice Saturday 10th. Visiting home decided to dine ar Amtersdam, moved from the King W and Portlamd location.  Great location, awesome patio, service was good. The Kitchen needs works, on timing, quality, taste. Half Smoked BBQ generous 1/2 portion, more smokeless than smoked, sides standard. Fish n Chip batter need to be not good,  cole slaw was a after through, Smoked  Brisket again more smokeless and smoked no BBQ sauce came with it.  Dont chopped it, sliced it.  Seem like the kitchen was over stressed due the drain or pumbling issues. Tourist trap, over price, food lacks taste and recipes to need revisited. Great location, and astomphere \"There is no bang for your buck here'"}
{"text":"Went there during Oktoberfest for a beer tour and to enjoy the festivities.  The beer tour is quite short and there isn't much touring since it is a small brewery inside, but it was informative and the tour guide was funny.   We were also informed that they rate their beers on the menu in IBU so you know how bitter your beer will be before ordering.  They had beer steins that you can keep when you order a liter of your choice of beer.  Although the liter beer steins ran out when we ordered I was able to get a half stein glass (take home), and ordered two different beers to make the liter.  I had an Oktoberfest beer which was good with a light hoppy taste.     The atmosphere is a nice pub, but open feel which I enjoyed.  They had a German band playing with some dancing.   Then and there I decided to try the Oktoberfest menu, which was the Schnitzel and pretzel which were both great!  The pretzel was perfect with the beer dipping sauce and the schnitzel was well breaded and paired with a hash-brown with gravy over it.  Although the Oktoberfest festivities were calm, it was an enjoyable time :-)"}
{"text":"I've biked here and streetcared it here and also walked from my friend's place. If you try to park near here it will be difficult or pricey.  Didn't really feel the needed to review this place before because, well it's just a large pub right?  Well no, it's actually pretty nice.  Just to grab a drink, watch a game on some screens, sit by the water patio and have pub food .... I love sweet potato fries btw.  I've seen a lot of people with suit cases here so I guess some are on their way from Porter ? It is a bit of a walk then though.   But the other day I decided to have dinner here after work.  Yum! The butternut squash ravioli was really good! And not overly priced of course for a brew house. Mix if al'dente yummy tasty sauce and crispy onions. I'd have it again. Normally I prefer meat in my ravioli but this satisfied my craving.  I can't comment too much on their beer as I'm not a beer person. They seem to have a good selection.  They do have my sweet stuff though, rose wine and somersby."}
{"text":"For the location and venue alone it is worth visiting.  Right on the waterfront with a fantastic patio and interior, it is tucked away and barely visible from the street.  It has a fantastic ambiance.   The flights of beer are fun, there are four choices each with rotating selections.  We had the fish tacos which were good but not amazing.  They soft shell they were in was too thin and quickly fell apart.  Its a fantastic choice for drinks and light fare - the location, the selection of beers and the interior really make it worth while."}
{"text":"I went to this place for team lunch. I don't drink so I can't comment on the beer. This place can take huge groups, somewhat like sport bar. I don't like bar food that much. The only food item I like on the menu is chicken wings. I ordered the house special burger, the portion is too big for me. First a few bites are OK. Then it got a little bit dry. I ordered fish and chips before, too. I don't like it either. Just regular fish and chip with higher price. I couldn't finish the dish. Anyway, the portion is definitely good. The view is awesome. And yes, you are paying the view for most parts. Maybe I could go there to enjoy the view of lake during summer, but I would not go for the food."}
{"text":"Nice lunch overlooking the waterfront. Great beers, I enjoyed the raspberry wheat with the kale, Brie and pear salad with added poached salmon, my husband enjoyed the brisket and son enjoyed the broiled encrusted cod. Yummy for all. The burgers looked great too."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Music wasn't too loud, view was good and good was great. I ordered a couple flights that weren't bad at all. I also ordered the fish and chips. The fish was fried light bit it was still pretty good. The chips and guac were also really good.   The place was nice and the food was good. For where its located, the prices are really good."}
{"text":"Can't beat the location and view. I've been here twice. Once for dinner on the patio and got a great view of the CN Tower. Second time just for drinks and apps. with a table on the second floor and a view of the boats.   Food is normal bar food. Flights of beer are a decent price and fun to try and friendly service. It's definitely a place I'd take any visitors to especially in the summer."}
{"text":"Spent a leisurely Saturday afternoon drinking the \"Rogue\" and eating bbq brisket with my beautiful wife...very nice!"}
{"text":"A lovely two-tiered patio overlooking Lake Ontario and the Islands, with a cavernous barn of seating inside. As the name suggests, this is a craft beer brewery that serves a good selection of excellent beers and typical pub food.  The beers range for light lagers, through IPAs and bitters to raspberry wheat. Or at least they do when available. On my visit quite a few of the regular beers were not available. If you want to sample a variety, without drinking too much, they do 4 x 5oz floats, giving you an adequate taster of 4 of their offerings.  The food overall is to a standard you would expect from a place like this. Nothing fancy, but fair for the price. I had the smoked brisket sandwich, which I enjoyed enough to make we want to go back for more. My Dad was impressed with the fish and chips, particularly the fish's beer batter. I found the fries a bit too greasy and overly salty for my liking, but other than that, was happy with the meal and service."}
{"text":"There is so much potential here, the location is great, local beer flights fantastic, service was knowledgeable and accommodating though it all took a turn when the food arrived.  This review is mainly towards management to really take the time to review and evolve their menu - I care about local new spots and really want AB to succeed. This is a great place to host special events and try new beers but the food really needs an uplift - I'm hoping as it just opened when I went they're weeding out the kinks.  We had the fish tacos (shell seemed stale, fish overfried, few bits of coleslaw - why?), poutine (seemed it was under an oven light for quite long), bland pizza, chicken salad was ok, salmon was burnt and everyone seemed to enjoy the pretzel which did look nice.  Looking forward to visiting again and giving it another shot!"}
{"text":"The best lakefront patio in Toronto! Plus, the Amsterdam beers rock! Their Caesars are not too shabby either... They also have an awesome bar with a huuuuge screen, the place is crazy busy but we often get lucky finding a seat at the bar. Now, getting a seat a the patio/deck in the summer... that's another story... but totally worth the wait. Haven't tried much of their food, mostly appetizers, and everything has been delicious! See you soon Amsterdam!"}
{"text":"Sat upstairs and outside on the deck overlooking the water. What a nice relaxing view. Started with the poutine and hot buffalo wings. They were both very delicious. I ordered a flight of beer too which was quite tasty.  They were out of a couple of beers which was ok cause there were plenty to choose from.  For lunch I ordered the southwest chicken pizza which was AMAZING.    Afterwards, I went to the bottle shop to purchase some goodies to take home."}
{"text":"Beer was tasty and the food was delicious. Had a problem with the host who was greeting people and taking names. She was rude and spoke to us like we were bothering her. We also has no cutlery and couldn't eat our appetizer for 15 minutes. We expressed our issues to the manager and he was super apologetic and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was better. Thank you to the manager and server for making up for the host's lack of professionalism. Would go here again, even with the not so great experience we had at the beginning."}
{"text":"This place is fine if you want to have an average and reasonable meal near the lake or if you're staying at the Westin. Otherwise, I'd walk up to king or queen st for more tasty options. I had fish tacos and fish and chips."}
{"text":"Ate here the first night in town. So good I had to come back the next night. Had the Pub burger and slaw. With a flight of beers. Really good. Second time I got the pork tacos. These were defiantly  \"get again food\"  another flight of beers to wash them down.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"While the service was good (our server was pleasant and very sweet), 3/4 Chicken Schnitzel dishes were blatantly undercooked and raw.   I can understand steak, for example, being ordered one way and coming out differently but undercooking a chicken dish so blatantly is a clear health hazard and unacceptable. I expect a restaurant to know how to cook chicken sufficiently.   Hopefully the kitchen received some feedback and no one else encounters this issue!"}
{"text":"Love this place !! Been a couple times now . I always get the smoked burger ... So fricken good ! Best burger in Toronto !!! Staff are amazing . Right on the water :)))"}
{"text":"It was a dreary holiday Monday, so we set our expectations low. The patio was only half-full and the hostess seated us immediately, but after 15 minutes of waiting neither we nor our neighbouring tables had been visited by a waiter. That isn't to say there weren't plenty of waiters: they were quietly but aggressively bickering with each other right beside our table. We ended up just walking out without ever being served.  Normally a wait is no big deal -- we'd just move to the bar or something, and the hostess did offer to reseat us in a different area as we were leaving -- but the general attitude was abysmal. I've had so-so experiences here in the past, but this is probably my last visit."}
{"text":"It's a cool place, food and drink is average, it's the great location because if the water. I wouldn't go there because of food and drink as its the location that's going to draw people. The food was overpriced, very expensive night for us.  Service at bar not ideal.  We tried it but don't see us coming to check it out again any time soon.  Mill street has better food and drink but lacking the waterfront. Our waiter though was awesome. Great view of water."}
{"text":"Perfect Patio Location!  If you want a prime patio location, this is it!  I've seen the line for this restaurant and always bypassed it but I finally decided to go. Luckily I didn't have to wait (my friends for in before me).  We sat on the patio, overlooking the lake but in direct contact with the hot sun but we endured. Restaurant was packed so service was panicky but friendly.   Food was really good.  Menu had a good variety of pub favourites. I had the fish and chips, but the fish was really greasy - couldn't finish it. Prices were decent too.  Overall, it was a decent place. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is super busy on a nice summer day.  They have multiple patio entrances, and a MASSIVE interior.   We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed with families, couples, and more - a varied demographic for sure (but who wouldn't want lunch with a beautiful lake view).    We decided to wait for a patio table that was lakeside, and we got a great view.   This was the climax of the visit, as it all was pretty downhill from there.  Service was frantic - there are servers running around everywhere, parties moving around tables without telling servers, and erratic returning of servers (i.e. one would come every ten min. but then not again for awhile).  Their \"beers\" are quite awkward and not \"craft\" beer by any means.   There is something off about them, as if they use syrups and not real ingredients.    I had a \"radler\" which wasn't a true radler, but instead a lager with some syrup added to it.   It irks me when a bar labels their beer with something but doesn't stay true to its form.   They must be trying to appeal to the Coors/Canadian crowd.... blech.  We decided not to stay for food after our lousy beverage experience.   If it weren't for the location I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It's right on the water, and there are many seats that allow you to have a great view of the lake. The service was good and it wasn't too crowded. The kitchen has glass windows so you can watch the chefs cook - you can see some of the brewing process as well. Everything that we ate we loved! I recommend the sausage pizza - it was delicious. And definitely large enough to share between two people. Connected to the restaurant is a gift shop and area to purchase bottles of some of their house-brewed beers. I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"All the food was on point! And the frozen sangria was to die for! Had a great girls night at the brew house. The view couldn't have been better and they had things on the menu for everyone (hint: order the Brussels sprouts!) The service was great and despite the fact that we showed up early they got us to a table. Ten out of ten would go again"}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because of the location and the patio.  A lake side patio is perfect for summer and that's exactly why we went. It was sizeable and had a good atmosphere. However, in my opinion this place is not the best brewery in Toronto and I believe for the price you pay here you could get better else where, the same goes for the food.  A part from that the service was great and we had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Lots of other reviews on the beer and the food here, and I can't add much there, other than that the burger is actually 2 thin patties made \"smash\" style.  Winds up being a huge mess in your hands and on your plate but it's delicious!    I'll just say - in case management ever scans these reviews - that our server Spencer was A++++.  Great menu and beer knowledge, and it was only his first shift.  Super impressed!"}
