{"text":"I love their food,no doubt.  But i was recently disappointed at them when all i had asked for was some extra raitha/sauce,they demanded a dollar. I gave up.  its not about the dollar,heck am ready to pay more for their food worth,but the attitude of front desk/chef to ask for the dollar,it doesnt happen in any decent restaurant or for the matter any other stripmall chinese takeout.  I used to order & always ask for the extra sauce and the folks have complied,Not sure if its the change of staff or new arrogant chef?  A dollar?? Cmon,my order was for 40 bucks."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Zero value for money. For the fish curry, got a bowl full of gravy with half a piece of fish swimming in it. All tHis for nearly 14 bucks. Never again."}
{"text":"I go there quite often for Take out because I work nearby. I find that sometimes they give you really terrible portions, depending on who serves you the take out order. Certain servers will give you 2 pieces of fish in the your fish curry, while others will load up your take out container. The food is OK but I think they can do better in their portions."}
{"text":"My favourite place for South Indian food.. The malabar paratas, Chettinad chicken and king fish fry are to die for! The chicken thali is great too wish they would add a salad though. Service is good, friendly staff."}
{"text":"The place is well know for its authentic south India food.They have a huge variety of dishes.The dishes like mutton suka varuval,chicken masala,biriyani,gee paper dosa and lot more are very delicious.The service of staff is awesome and very friendly.I visited this place last week and left the place with a wonderfull experience and I can say that this is one of the best restraunt  in GTA...I would recommend this place to anyone at any time."}
{"text":"although I'm a devoted fan of subcontinental cuisine I don't know much about southern Indian food, other than dosa. the super friendly servers at Anjappar Chettinad took me on a little tour of the buffet before I got started. so many new and wonderful flavors! chili fish! rockin soundtrack! for $10.99 it's not the cheapest buffet lunch I've had in Brampton, but the food is totally unique and worth the adventure."}
{"text":"Food was extremely good and authentic tasting. The service times could  be a tad faster though. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Indian buffet I have been to- def not worth $15. There were only two non veg dishes, chicken and shrimp curry. The chicken was pink. They gave us a 15% discount for catching that. Dessert was icecream, fruit and gulab jamun. I would stick with the sq1 location, best food ever."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is so good! Literally orgasm in my mouth!!! I love cooking with flavours and sauce, these chefs have the right knack for cooking; mixing and mingling the perfect flavours together. If you appreciate loads of flavour and sauce TRY THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the service sucks ass. It used to be so much better a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a South Indian buffet at a reasonable price. Service is always friendly every time we have visited them. Food is flavorful and not overly spicy. I love their porottas and meat dishes in the buffet along with the idlis."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff who always follow up with you. We really enjoy the spicy dishes and gravy!"}
{"text":"Another great find in a funny, tiny strip mall. The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful when we trying to figure out what to order, also a very friendly couple there telling us that the food was spicy and chatting to us. We ended up getting Idlies to start, masala dosa, Anjappar chicken masala and to cap it off crab roast (nandu varuval) It was a great recommendation from the waitress, the only thing is that it was extremely messy so maybe would think about getting something else next time.  We also went to their weekday lunch buffet. It was a very small buffet with just a tiny variety of food. Small salad bar, some chicken and veggie dishes and a couple of other things that I can't even remember. The stand out for me was their coconut chutney and their all you can eat dosa. I knew it was a dosa buffet but was confused because we didn't see any on the buffet. A kind man explained that you had to order them off the menu. So basically you can order as many as you want and as many different kinds of dosa as you would like as well. They cook them fresh and hot and bring them right to the table for you. My con for this would be that being new to this buffet I wish there was a sign or some sort of indication telling you how to order your food. Also the waitstaff should have told you how the buffet works with the dosa ordering."}
{"text":"Their customer service was so bad that I couldn't enjoy the food. We went for a really late lunch, so we quickly decided on our meal. Every time there was some eye contact with a server to indicate I was ready to order, they looked away and went on to doing other things. It got to the point where I was staring specifically at the register so they would get the point! It took 20 minutes to take my order!"}
{"text":"Stopped short of saying \"I'm a fan\" coz of service. Unlike my other reviews of Indian restaurants where I mentioned they are great on appetizers but not on main course this one reverses the tide. Appetizers are ok but food is superb!. The Veg biryani reminded me of a popular restaurant back in India that had amazing biryani. We went in a group of 17 people so the above rating is actually a survey :)  Bad part, or not so good part, I agree we didnt give much notice for reservation for such a large group but the servers kept us hanging and telling us 10 minutes more at least 3-4 times and didn't care to at least start taking orders or update us. Then few misses while serving first cold biryanis, then missing Idlis, forgot to refill water or check more frequently if something is needed, hasting us out of door (agreed, it was closed but if you see group that's willing to come again you go extra mile err..kilometer)."}
{"text":"Went there after along time and they have done a soft transformation. The menu might be more or less the same but I feel the food quality has improved greatly. Had the veg soups which was great as always. I have never been dissapointed by their soups. Even their mutton soup is great in flavor, even though I wish there was more meat in it. Talking about Mutton, I feel these guys make justice to it out of all the places available in Toronto (including all Tamil take out restaurants in Scarborough) They have a good variety of mutton dishes and they all taste great! The portion size is decent and the flavour is amazing. I also had their dosas which  was good. The tomato chutney could have been better in my opinion (The Saravanabhavan one is the best so far). Their seafood selection is also pretty good. I should also mention that their service was pretty good. Even though they didn't have a table for us when we went in, within 10 minutes they organised something for us. Nights are usually very busy especially in the weekends where Lunch time would be busy as well. But I am liking the improved version. Would be great if the Kaima Idly and other south indian dishes like pongal, upma, kool, appam are included in the menu."}
{"text":"On good days, you can get the best chicken lollypop, sambhar, chetinad chicken curry at this place .. on not so good days, you would be so disapponted that you wouldn't want to ever come back here. That is the major problem with this restaurant .. they lack consistency and it gets really annoying when you expect good food and end up with trash."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about the buffet here but never got a chance to try it, so instead, I thought of going for the Ã€ la carte option. People recommended the dosa but I was in the mood to try the curries and the parathas. I did not regret my choice. I ended up ordering 12 parathas, because they were soo good.  We ordered fish curry, chicken pepper masala, butter chicken, chicken biryani and mutton biryani. My favourite was the chicken pepper. It was really spicy, but I was warned, so won't be pointing fingers. It was more like a workout but yet enjoyable .   The french fries were different from regular ones, they added some kind of masala which made it taste great.   I loved everything here but the only drawback was the price. It wasn't worth the quantity. The mutton biryani was 13.99$. I was expecting a big portion for that price. The quantity will be enough for one person because there was more mutton than rice.   To end this lunch experience we ordered Mango lassi and tea. Loved both!   I would come to this place again to try the buffet because the A la carte was a bit too expensive."}
{"text":"In one of my reviews I had made earlier, I had mentioned that this place was expensive for the quantity they served. I went for the breakfast buffet today, and I only paid 10.99$, which is cheaper than other places I've been to. The quality of food at other places (for buffet) is not that great. Whereas over here, every dosa served was crisp and fresh with that lovely ghee taste.   They had a good variety at the buffet table. They had Idly, Channa, Dosa, Chicken gravy, Coffee, Rasam, Sambar and so on. All the basic dishes from South India.  I would definitely come back to this place. Everything was good, from the quality of food to the pricing.  Unfortunately, I couldn't click pictures this time since I didn't really have time. The breakfast buffet closes at 12 pm and I reached there at 11:35 am. I just went straight to stuffing my face with food. So, sorry about that.   They served coffee for breakfast as well, which was an added bonus. No place serves coffee or tea as part of their buffet menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to start off our vacation in Toronto with a lunch at Anjappar. I was craving some South Indian goodness and my husband suggested this place, after having been to some of their other locations. (Later though, we found out that this is a different Anjappar from the ones he had been to. Still, it was pretty good.)  The restaurant itself was quite cramped. They weren't too busy when we arrived, though the place quickly filled up by the time we were done. We had to wait quite a long while for someone to come seat us, and later, even longer before we could place our orders.  Their menu was pretty huge and it certainly took us a while to decide what we wanted. We started off with a Mango Lassi, which was deliciously yummy. For entrees, I had the Paper Dosa, which was somewhat of a disappointment, though that's not any fault of the dish. The paper dosa, being extremely crispy was a little difficult to eat or soak into the chutneys. I do have to say that that is exactly what a paper dosa is and this was the first time I was having it - I just had different expectations. The dosa was HUGE - table wide - and it came with a coconut chutney, a mint chutney, and sambhar. The sambhar was good but the coconut chutney lacked flavor. As someone who loves coconut chutneys, this was disappointing. But the mint chutney more than made up for it. I just wished they refilled the chutneys. When I tried to ask for a refill, there was no waiter around. By the time someone came by, I was done with my dish.  My husband ordered the Chicken Biryani, which is his go-to in most Indian restaurants. It was quite authentic by South Indian standards and richly spiced, and even I enjoyed a couple of spoonfuls of the biryani.  We also ordered a plate of Chicken 65 to go. Honestly, the packaging smelled very weird to me - I had a bad feeling about the food itself, but luckily once we opened the box, the chicken smelled fine. Maybe it was just the packaging. The Chicken 65 itself was just okay. Having grown up eating this dish too often, I was disappointed that this one tasted nothing like the one from my childhood. It wasn't bad just not authentic enough.  Overall, we liked this place. I know I will stay away from the paper dosa next time - I would love to try their other dosas (they had plenty of options in the dosa category."}
{"text":"Best South Indian Food, especially authentic TamilNadu food. Must try Kothu Parotta and Vanjaram Fish fry."}
{"text":"Horrible is a small word for this place. Service sucks big time. Wait times are crazy.  We checked in at 9 on a Saturday night and they are out of fish, mutton. Seriously!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service 4/5- Friendly & Helpful Masala Dosa 4/5- Real good...crispy...Potato filing perfectly flavored. Chicken Milagu Masala 2/5- Great tasting at first; after you realize the over powering taste of cardamom and other spices.  In their defense server advised prior to ordering dish is spicy. Chicken 65 3/5- Okay nothing special...deep fried chicken with no dipping sauce. Tanddor Roti 5/5-  Made in Tandoor...crisoy"}
{"text":"First off, I am not really a fan of south indian food.  Anjappar actually offers a wide range of tastes from South to North, though.  That said, if I want north Indian I'll probably go to a Punjabi restaurant ;)  So basically, we go back here again and again for the Dosa...  and normally just Masala Dosa (although I have tried a couple of others).  And it is good...  as far as dosa goes, especially since I don't really crave it, but I can enjoy it here.  And I'm sure we have been a dozen times or more since it's opened.  Service is always friendly.  They offer take-out as well but I prefer my dosa fresh and crispy - tends to get soggy in the container by the time I get home.  They also offer delivery with https://just-eat.ca  There is also a buffet on some nights, but haven't tried it.  I'm not that adventurous over here, will stick with old faithful and have the masala dosa.  But there are many other flavours you can try!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who is authentically Indian - born and raised and gave birth to his two (pre-teen and teenage) daugthers in India ...   In his opinion, this is the best Indian buffet around.    I agree that the food is very good but I wouldn't say it was the best Indian food around ... I feel as though I have had better and another downside is that the selection is extremely limited :(  I think there were less than 10 main dishes to choose from and often times, the popular dishes would be all gone.  The most popular dish was most surely the dosa.  The dosa bread(?) itself was very light, chewy, and crispy, with a hint of sour.  It was pretty good ... when you could get it.   The spicy soup (traditional to South Indian cuisine)  was very yummy.  My friend was worried that it would be too spicy for us but I loved it.  I often judge an indian buffet by its naan bread and I can't say I loved the naan.  Too bad :(  My son really loved it though, haha.  He couldn't get enough :)    The place reminds me of an Irish Pub with some Indian embellishments and flair.  The dark wood, the bar, the layout ... all remind me of an Irish pub!    Service was okay ... I felt bad for the waitress.  I think there was only one waitress and she was working the entire room.  Service was a little slow and spotty but you can't blame her.  She was thin and looked tired.  Maybe my expectations were a little too high and this is why I was disappointed.  Not too sure about the prices since I didn't pay but I have a feeling they are probably not too outrageous."}
{"text":"i was in the mood to try something different and decided to pop in here for a bite at lunch.  Luckily it had just opened so there weren't many people in the restaurant and we were seated quickly.  To my surprise their food was delicious and very flavourful - i cannot believe this restaurant was here for YEARS and this was my first time walking into it (I've lived in brampton for over 30 years in the same neighbourhood).  I had the mild Dosa because i didnt now how spicy their food can get, but definitely will try something more medium next time as i realized i can handle more spice than i assumed. I found the Dosa very light and fluffy and definitely not greasy. The waitress was kind enough to explain what all the sides were as well!  Definitely a recommended place, especially for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place as it is another run of the mill Indian restaurant (out of all the gazillions out there in Canada). We wanted to eat south Indian food so gave this place a try.  The pakoras were really oily (and I mean \"really\" oily), the chicken rasam (soup) lacked flavour and was a tad bit over spicy (wait! Does that make it flavorful? Nah, I don't think so), the chicken chettinad again suffered with the same problem, paneer butter masala was too sweet and other stuff I did not bother trying as I wasn't able to make out what's what.  All being said, the sambhar and dosa were outstanding and that's what the 4 stars are for."}
{"text":"not bad for a South Indian restaurant. I didn't have too much expectation as it is a chain restaurant.  Decent food, service was ok. Wish there was more choices of food especially during dinner. Idli was slightly dry."}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order over 40 mins ago. Nothing fancy, just an order for two people. Never received any call to confirm the order. I called to inquire and was told they \"forgot\" about the order. When I asked if it is ready, they said they will need another 30-40 mins! Jesus friggin' christ! What are they picking the veggies and waiting for the eggs to hatch into chickens!?"}
{"text":"Everything tastes really good, but there's no escaping the hotness of the food unless you choose the buffet and take ice cream breaks between plates.  Also the buffet selection is a little bit limited. But when you get bored of that you can order different things off the menu instead."}
{"text":"Anjappar is a gem of a joint that's much underrated much like Chettinad cuisine itself. It's a relatively moderate sized space and has an endearing,  polite and attentive staff. Most of the staff itself is from South India and that adds to the ambience and authenticity of the restaurant.    Anjappar, hands down, serves the best non-vegetarian south Indian Cuisine. Period! Even their vegetarian cuisine is a thing of art,  and make sure you try their Tomato soup. It's creamy, it's thick and it's a perfect blend of tang and sweetness.  I also love their garlic Naan which goes well with the 'Chettinad chicken' or 'Sukka Mutton' (Dry goat curry). If wheat isn't your thing then go for a Podi Dosa as your carb option to eat the meat dishes with.  Their Biryanis aren't all that great, personally, but they're decent nuff.    Also they serve a pretty decadent falooda which is an ice cream float essentially with rose water milk, the semolina balls you find in bubble tea and vermicelli and other goodies. It is an opulent way to end a meal.  All in all its one of my fav places to eat and the dishes pack a punch because of their pepper-y roots. Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Visited for brunch in the weekend. The variety has reduced from what it was before. The taste was not bad but nothing exceptional for South Indian food. The idli, vada, puri, chutney were ok, but pongal, dosa and Chana masala were not up to the mark. The coffee was excellent. I wouldn't visit them soon for brunch, but rather try out something else in Brampton or Mississauga."}
{"text":"Wow,  try the tandoori chicken.  Might be the best checked I've ever had.  Everyone I bring agrees. It takes forever to make,  you wait over 30 min,  but soooo worth it. The salad it comes with is delicious also. Great price. I think it on the appetizer side of the menu.   Servers are very nice and place is clean."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Anjappar like couple years ago and from that point on, I always come here for some good South Indian food. The staff is really friendly and this place is well maintained.  I have gone to their lunch buffet which is really good but its all vegetarian which is sometimes hard for me since I need to incorporate meat. Usually I come here in the evening time, right before the dinner crowd arrives since its not too busy then. Normally I get the chef's special the Anjappar chicken with Aloo Kulcha & Ceylon Egg Parota. Also, I grab the Masala Dosa or the Ghee Dosa which is delicious but mainly I love the presentation, the Dosa comes in the shape of the CN tower lol. To drink I usually grab their mangoshake since its soo good. If the shake hasn't filled me up, for dessert, I either get the fruit salad with mango ice cream or the Falooda. If you want the full Indian experience make sure you try their authentic Indian tea. If your down for something new try this place :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited late (after their buffet had already closed) so this is a review of their regular dine in.   Great food and the staff there are very kind and funny. I personally like my food extremely extremely spicy and they seemed a little confused when I ordered it as such. But once I explained my odd taste in food they were more than happy to spice it up.   The staff were very fun to watch while cleaning up the rest of the restaurant with their singing and a little dancing.   The food was very tasty and came out really hot and freshly made. Prices were reasonable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Limited selection but absolutely delicious. Great value for your money."}
{"text":"My favourite south indian food. I visit this place minimum 3 times a month. So good food. I love all their food. All briyani kothu rotti. Mutton sukka varuval with butter naan. Cant go wrong with their buffet. Lots of food for good price. If u order food its kind of expensive but i really think its worth for the money"}
{"text":"Ordered This off UberEat..  Friggggin AWESOME!!  BUTTER CHICKEN w/ BUTTER NAAN I've been looking for the best butter chicken since my high school days when I first tried it at my friends house. Mission Complete!  Chicken was tender 5/5 Sauce 5/5 Naan 3/5 ( I prefer Garlic)   MASALA DOSA Tried plain dosa the other day and wanted to experiment on the other flavour options. From the reviews I read I was leaning this one based off spice and flavour. The spice lives up to the reviews and there is a kick. Came with a nice soup and what I believe to be Sambar and another green sauce.  Dosa 3/5 Soup 4/5  This place really has me wanted to visit the buffet!   Enjoy"}
{"text":"The reviews seemed good but i must have come on an off day. The food was not up to my expectations, either that or other people have lower expectations.  The service was slow and it was not even a busy night, we almost felt like we were not wanted here.  The plates were barely off the table when the bill came and we took that as a sign of its time to leave since nobody cared to ask if we wanted anything else."}
{"text":"Good place for family outings. Though their food is little inconsistent, overall good food."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a bold statement: Quite possibly the best Indian buffet I've had!   The food here was fantastic, and is the closest thing to home cooked food I've experienced at an Indian restaurant. Coming from Sri Lanka, South Indian cuisine does not stray too widely from some of our dishes and that really came out while I was eating.   You know that moment in Ratatouille when (spoiler warning) the food critic was transported back to his childhood after tasting the ratatouille, well I had a similar experience with some of the food here.   The right amount of spice, affordable pricing, very friendly staff and not an overwhelming choice before you makes this lunch buffet hit you in just the right spots.   The restaurant filled up while we were there with other groups and I didn't see a single non-South Asian face. That could be because of a fact I learnt while there, which was that Anjappar Chettinad is a chain found in a few countries (originating from India) and after having experienced it, I am not surprised at why a lot of Indians covet it. I can only eagerly await my boss taking us out for another lunch here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Trivia: Why Indians eat with using all five fingers instead of the silver?  A: In order to enjoy the meal using all the five senses that is best obtained by the nerve endings of one's fingers :)    i did exactly that and forgot for a moment that i was actually not in India ! Finally i found a south Indian restaurant so authentic that actually serve authentic regional spicy food ! Well, Chettinad is a way of cuisine in Tamilnadu (South of India) where the food is relatively spicier and meats, seafood are one of their specialties. Also one of the special cooking methods of this region is that they finish off the meats by tempering with mustard seeds on top. In India , the mustard seeds are not usually tempered for meats but only for the preparation of vegetable curries.   Do look for white board special as it would be the best they can make that day. we ordered the whole fish fry and believe it or not but this dish was a repeat on demand of ours and friend's 3yr old. It was a hit! For the main course we ordered some fish curry, goat curry and some naans. The goat curry was ok but fish curry was spicy and the best . It is certainly no comparison to any Modified-Indian cuisines in B-lo.  My cute friend who is originally from West of India says that she wouldn't trade anything for a huge Dosa (crispy thin lentil crepes served with coconut chutney & spicy sambar). Usually this is a breakfast thing for southerners so it would be like eating ham & eggs at a Steakhouse for dinner! But it was that good!   Servers are true natives who will guide you well and nothing Americanized or genetically modified about the place or food !!! Can travel 2 hours again to eat here. They have another location in Toronto too."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying South Indian food. The dinner buffet was pretty good and I especially enjoyed the chili fish, egg masala and butter chicken. I can't speak to how authentic it is but my friend who brought us here says they hail straight outta his hometown in India which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This is now my current go-to place for butter chicken. Nobody else has done it better and here are the reasons why:  1) Flavour is amazing. The sauce is not too ketchup-y and I like how they make it a bit spicier 2) Perfect ratio of chicken to sauce, for me at least 3) The garlic naan is slathered with garlic 4) The portion size is very generous. There's usually enough for my boyfriend and I to split 5) Service has always been great  Love this place"}
{"text":"After a long time in Mississauga I found a place that satisfies my taste buds. Service was Excellent and I loved the music being played in the background ,a mix of old and recent Tamil songs .I plan to come here often.Overall felt Great:)"}
{"text":"Busy Indian restaurant located in a tiny plaza by square one. Came here on a Saturday night and the place was overflowing with people until closing time. Lots of people ordering sit-down meals but also a lot of people getting takeout. We had to wait about 45 minutes to get a seat, but we were a larger party so that was fine.  The food was really good and beware that they do not mess around with the spice level. We started with the chicken lollipops which were exactly how we remembered them in India. For mains we orders a variety of dosas which were good, butter chicken, a mutton curry, and mutton coconut fry. All the dishes were authentic and tasted great. The two mutton dishes were very spicy so might want to stay away if you're not into spicy food.  Also tried the mango milkshake which was nice and refreshing.  The service was great - they did their best to accommodate us as fast as possible, and the orders were taken and brought out with no errors. The food was made fresh and came out within 10 minutes.  Would recommend trying to make a reservation no matter what size group you come with, as the place seemed to be extremely busy no matter the time."}
{"text":"My all time favourite restaurant. I have had food delivered. Great taste. Their garlic fish dry is a must try."}
{"text":"Excellent south indian food. Great variety, Courteous staff"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch and ordered the Masala Dosa and idly. They were not bad however the stuffing for the masala dosa was not as traditional tasting as I am use to.   They have a buffet as well. Which seemed interesting but I did not try the buffet.   I have it a 4 star but more like 3.5.  I would prefer if the stuffing was a bit more traditional and dry."}
{"text":"Being from India, I really appreciated the authenticity of this restaurant. The dosa and the thali were both yummy. We also got shrimp curry, which was quite delicious! Would go there again for South Indian food!"}
{"text":"I had been to the Indian branch of this place, so I was very excited to try food here... placed order for veg Thali/meal and masala Dosa. This is what I thought:- Quantity: 5/5 Quality: 4/5 ( it's pretty close to south Indian taste but not totally there yet, but if I crave for south Indian food, I will come back) Ambience: 5/5 Service: 2/5 (the only thing they lack at for me is service, it's slow and the servers really didn't pay any attention to the our order, tried calling a server and reminding her of my order, but she didn't even listen, and when I tried pointing out this thing to their cashier, she was rude and made me feel that it was my fault, no apologies what so ever)  Overall, I feel it's pretty good, but would have been excellent with better service. Will definitely visit for the food"}
{"text":"Good spread for lunch.  Buffet covering fish, prawn, chicken, egg biryani, sambhar, rasam, couple of veg dishes, curd, salad, papad.  Not to forget the dosas which were sparingly dished out. I guess they want the guests to eat other things.  Personally if something is a part of the spread it should be replenished of charged.  Desert had one South Indian item + 5 ice cream flavours.  Coffee was chargeable and average.  Overall average food with below average service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Unfortunately, the dosa and accompaniments that I picked up for a take out lunch were the worst tasting of such I'd ever had. It was so disappointing. On the up side, the staff was super friendly. The buffet looked alright. I might give this place one more try but no dosa for me."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on a whim when I was looking for a good indian food place to try and decided that this was the one. We opted for delivery because why not.  I usually judge the place based on my all time favourite Butter chicken and when I got it for sure this place has it down! It surpassed the other ones I tried and for sure this is where am getting it from now on.  Aside from that dish, we also got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread. The masala was alright, I tasted a better one elsewhere so this one wasn't really my favourite from them. And the garlic naan was yummy. Really generous with the garlic for sure.   And I also got a Mango lassi, I didnt like their version that much so I think I'll skip on this one next time.  Anyway, I have yet to try their other dishes in the future so for now am just giving them three stars. And also the other reason for the rating was because our food arrived late. Am glad I waited a little bit more because I was close to complaining. But other than that, food is decent and I would order from them again."}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant for a friend's party recently. The restaurant is situated in a plaza with a bunch of shops next to a dollar store. It doesn't look too great from outside but once you are in, you will see a real south indian ambience.  They had catered for a large group and we ordered off the menu. Service was pleasant and quick. I really appreciated that. I had the Anjappar vegetarian special (which is a rice thali), i enjoyed the curry and food but i found them all to be oily. My friend had the biriyani and it was definitely better than my plain white rice. However his dish curries. Overall, good restaurant but food may be average to good."}
{"text":"Goood non veg South Indian food . Dosa are decent too . Fairly priced and good place to entertain guests !"}
{"text":"The food here is spicy and peppery, exactly what food from the\"Chettinad\" region should taste like. I have dined here plenty of times and this place always delivers. The chicken biryani is juicy, and the accompanying curries and flavorful. The vegetarian plate meal is a treat, and I really like the \"vettu kozambu\" that is served with the plate meal. The vecchu roti is authentic. The crab soup is really peppery and I highly recommend it. The potato balls (bondas) are great with the mint chutney. The dosas are good although Gurulakshmi is better. Sambhar and rasam are top notch. Some of the chicken starters are pretty oily though, so I would avoid them if you're into healthy living. Servers are polite and dishes are served pretty fast.  I noticed that a few reviewers claim that its a standard south indian restaurant and this is inaccurate. If you walk in, grab a dosa and walk out without actually trying any of the Chettinad dishes that the restaurant is actually known for, you're completely missing the point."}
{"text":"My office is directly across from this place. Our staff is all BANNED from going here for lunch as the management feels that such low quality food will lower the productivity of workers. Lol  I've been here several times: The portions here are normal sized but there is always a very small portion of meat in the curries (much less meat than most other Indian restaurants. I've called them out on this more than once, but they insist it's \"standard\".  They try to compensate for the small meat portions by loading up on the spices so if you're even slightly sensitive, you're almost sure to have digestive track problems.   My top picks for Indian restaurants in the Toronto area are:  Bombay Bhel and Bhanjara  The masala tea here is great and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"We went for dinner. It was crowded even on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. I wanted to get dosa but discovered that they had a dinner buffet which includes dosas. They also had a wide spread of dishes like sambhar, biryani, fish, chicken, idlis and medu vadas. They had quite a few dessert options as well including ice cream, kheer, fruits. The service was great. They gave us extra chutney and raita as the buffet had run out. It just took a bit of time getting our bill. Definitely a place worth visiting."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and loved it both times. I would definitely go more often if the wait times were not very long on the weekends.  Their buffet was amazing. I was craving some vada and idli and it definitely satisfied me. They have many varieties of their breakfast/brunch buffet. Their tea was just perfect."}
{"text":"AWFUL BOILED EGGS!  This is a wonderful south Indian cuisine restaurant in Brampton. Some of the best south Indian dishes. Surprisingly their Chicken Tikka is one of the finest I have eaten. Takes a while to get out. But just superb.   We live their south Indian biryani... Especially the prawn biryani. The only problem I have is they DO NOT KNOW HOW TO BOIL EGGS! They over cook the eggs that the yolk is grey green black. Most unappetising! Chef, take note! You fail on boiling eggs."}
{"text":"We lived in Mississauga for a while and this place brings the heat! My husband still raves about their Mutton Pepper Fry. My daughter loves the lollipop chicken. I've had their tali and it is a proper South Indian tali, sans banana leaf. Good coconut chutney and decent sambar. My husband was stoked to find real Kerala porotta. He ordered it with the Mutton Pepper Fry, which is the spiciest dish I've eaten in all of Canada and the US. It is amazing. I tried the crab curry and it was pretty good too. We really miss this place and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best butter chicken I've ever had. Great food, usually good service (as long as you don't have to deal with the older lady). The only Indian restaurant that delivers to your house. Too bad they're overpriced."}
{"text":"Their mild spicy is actually very spicy for those who are not a fan of chilli. So be careful when choosing ur level of chilli. Awesome restaurant bery great authentic indian taste. Had their fish briani( was spicy) - i loved it. The fish did not have the smelly fishy smell like other briani places I had. Well seasoned.  Took a meat dish masala was super spicy but still great taste prepare ur nose to be running.  Had their lolipop chicken too- it was that great as lolipop. Was ok to eat but not great.  If you are using gps, it will make u skip the entrance to the restaurant lol. Just slow down to look for the entrance"}
{"text":"Horrible music, too loud, really bad sambhar, idli vada, excellent kothu (chicken and mutton) roti. Simple ambience. Decent service. Nothing above and beyond."}
{"text":"The best chana masala Ive ever had- my partner and I are regular customers. Their naans are always very good too. Only con is delivery time (around 40mins-1 hr) but if you're willing to wait then its worth it!"}
{"text":"have only had take out here but the service at the counter is always great!   best butter chicken & naan!!!! have eaten from here close to 8 times, always get the same dish & never disappointed:-)"}
{"text":"Just ordered chicken tikka masala for take out. I got home and opened up the container to find an oily mess with 6....yes 6 small pieces of chicken. For $14 I expected a lot more quantity but I guess that's what you get for going to a second rate Indian restaurant. It tasted like curry and oil. I will never order from here again and I will be sure to tell all my friends to AVOID AVOID AVOID."}
{"text":"Ordered pepper chicken, chicken 65 & poondu kolambu.. All tasted horrible, this is not the quality u get in original anjapaar.. Chicken was tasteless, i guess it was in freezer for a long time. Will never order nor recommend anyone"}
{"text":"I will give no ratings for this restaurant as I went to order for take out today , food can be good or bad but people forget that their is customer service too , like the boy or man who was here today afternoon was not interested in taking the order and his voice time sounded rude too and I asked him to call the manager too but he didn't and I came back without taking food as I don't wanted to create a scene there . Horrible customer service very poor ."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Indian buffet for lunch close to my appointment while visiting town.  I'm glad I found this place.  I have rarely eaten south Indian food, so this was a little different from what I am used to, but I liked it.  Certainly a bit hotter (spicier) than northern Indian. My favorite surprise was the fish curry.  I was a little wary of fish from a buffet but there were no off tastes and the curry complemented the fish nicely w/o overwhelming it.  The kormas were good as was the potato masala, the dosas,  and the prawn pakoras (never had those before).  I was a little disappointed that there was no rice desert available but they had a variety of different ice creams (including mango) and they had gulab jamun balls (which I have always found to be far too sweet for my tastes). Nothing fancy here, just good Indian food fast and easy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very authentic! Their Dosa is one of the best Dosas I have had. Unfortunately because the Dosa was large, I did not order anything else in the menu. My husband tried their buffet which is a huge selection for only $16.99. (Holiday buffet) He was quite happy with the food and can tell that it's a place alot of Indian families would come for a family meal together. So you know it's a great restaurant. I did try their specialty drink called a Falooda. It was very sweet and tasty drink. Overall, a nice restaurant. Would come here more often if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Of all their locations in GTA, this one is the best in terms of maintaining consistency.  We love their crispy hot vada, Vanjaram fish fry (not available daily, can't figure out the schedule), podi dosa and kada dosa. Everything smells, feels and tastes fresh. I know its nothing to rave about but man the lemonade rocked during our last visit!  I'm not a big fan of their buffet though. It sounds economical but its tough to maintain the same standards during 'mass production' I guess.  Service is friendly and plenty of parking space in the plaza.  Give it a try folks!"}
{"text":"I visited this place in Nov 2015. Liked the food & options. Got a chance to visit it again in June 2016. Horrible experience. Poor food quality & taste. They are now out of my places to eat."}
{"text":"On Monday we decided to go for an impromptu work lunch, just three of us.  I suggested dosa (my favourite South Indian food).  My co-worker suggested Anjappar and I'm so glad she did.  We were greeted warmly and shown to a table.  There were two options: Buffet or menu, we chose buffet.  The buffet was fresh and contained many items I was familiar with, as well as a few that were new to me.  We had a co-worker that doesn't eat meat, which was fine since the buffet was about 75% vegetarian.  The dosa with the potato masala was just awesome!  Spicy and crispy!  I also tried other items, like the Lentil Rasam and chili fish.  Everything was great.  Can't wait to come back, with my family this time.  Any chance you can open one of this in Newmarket or even Markham?  That would be even better!"}
{"text":"The Anjappar Chicken Masala really tested the limits of my tolerance for spicy Indian food. It was full of flavour, but damn was it spicy. Their paratha was absolutely divine, serving as a perfect companion to the Anjappar Chicken Masala gravy. Overall the food was alright at this place. The service was prompt, courteous and friendly. I'm not sure I'd be back necessarily. Next time I'm in Mississauga, I'd be more tempted to check out one of the myriads of other good Indian restaurants since this one didn't impress me that much. I haven't tried their buffet, as it was closed, but it could very well be worth the money. Their buffet prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This would be your standard South Indian restaurant with a North Indian menu added.   Food is okay. I had the Mysore Masala Dosa and my girlfriend had the Masala Dosa. Mysore masala dosa was spicy but tolerable. Masala dosa was good. The coconut chutney and sambhar was good. The masala filling was mushy.  Service is really good. We had a lovely waitress who was very responsive and attentive.   Overall, the food wasn't anything amazing but a bit above average. And the prices are quite reasonable as well.   I would give it a 3.5 out of 5 if I could."}
{"text":"We have been to this place so many times, and every single time it has amazed us with the quality of the food. Be it Cauliflower 65, Chilli Onion Dosa, Veg Kothu Parotta, Onion Pakoda, Sambhar Vada, Katharikkai Kuzhambu or even just the buffet. Definitely serves one of the best South Indian food in the area (and probably Toronto). My favorites would be Onion Pakoda and Veg Kothu Parotta. The flavors are great.  While the buffet is good, they haven't sectioned out veg and non-veg separately, so everything is kept together which may be uncomfortable for some.  Where they need to improve is the service which is, sometimes, awfully slow and otherwise slow, in general. So, if you are really hungry and want something quick - don't come here. This is more of a relax dining place.  There is shared parking which is generally available, so that is never a challenge."}
{"text":"I'm a real fan of this place these days, and we drive all the way here if we're craving authentic Indian food. It's the spicy regional Indian cuisine we've been missing in downtown Toronto.  If you go, ignore the same old butter chicken and all the usual commercial favourites. Try the chicken chettinad, porotta or even better - the meals! It's really good and authentic food. This place is my new gem. Bring your best spice tolerance palette along!"}
{"text":"First off I'd like to point out that the food at this restaurant is AMAZING! Great job by the chefs who really keep this place up and running. Great food. Takes you back to Chennai where I'm originally from whether it comes to the food, the ambience or the music. This place knocks it out of the park when it comes to the things I've mentioned in this paragraph.  Let's get to why I'm giving it a \"2\" star rating. Having said all the good things above, the management and service at this place really really really really really really sucks. The managers don't really care about the service or the customers who keep this place up and running. The attitude of one particular male bearded manager was so awful that we considered leaving the place several times. His attitude towards us was despicable and when we complained, this manager had the audacity to undermine our concerns and raise his voice. We still stayed there because it was really late and all other places were pretty busy.  Walking into the place we were not seated properly nor were we given a timeline as to when we would be seated. We had to take matters into our own hands to find extra chairs for our table. We got our table thanks to a couple of women who were considerate enough to move themselves to a 2 person table instead of the 4 person table they were originally occupying.   Again, if there's a way someone can read this and take some action against the poor service would be great! But then again, the food was to die for.  Your's truly,  A customer who loved the food, hated the service."}
{"text":"And update to my previous review: I went here again and got the Mysore masala dosa. The dosa was way too oily despite me asking them to use less oil. The dosa was tasteless too. Go for their curries not for the dosas."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering an appetizer before your main course because they bring out each course whenever they feel like. We were also asked if we would like our drinks (Royal Falooda) brought out as a dessert and after specifying that we'd like it with our appetizers, came out with the mains. Don't bother complaining either because they will just stand there, look at you dumb, say \"oh\" and walk away. So visit this place if you like to enjoy your appetizers hot and main food cold because it will just sit there."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for dosa. I've been to most of south India n have a great tastebuds for south indian food. They serve the best sambar n coconut chutney.  I would suggest to try their idlis dipped in sambar. Had those after a pretty long time abd they are a must for me to take everytime i visit this place.  Mysore masala dosa n uttapam are great.   Bonus:- they serve buffet in dinner  Not so bonus:- buffet is limited and can be expanded.   Suggestion to store:- please start preparing rava dosa too as there are (i hope so) lot of rava fans craving for some nice dosas."}
{"text":"Liked the gobi 65, onion pakoda, ghee dosa, medhu wada, veg thali and mango lassi.. Super food.. Enjoyed a lot.."}
{"text":"Not our favorite Indian in town, but Anjappar wins for the most unique dishes between it's competitors. It is clearly a regional variation to check out, as it could be just the difference you are looking for."}
{"text":"What I love about the greater Toronto area (GTA) is the vast abudnance of South Indian/Sri Lankan/SE Asian cuisine dining choices. This particular one does offer often a few non-mainstream menu entrees. However today I elected to try the buffet, just to get a feel for the variety. I noticed they had goat bone soup besides the traditional 'Rasam' (funny enough the word means juice, but spicy juice as this is prepared mainly with tamarind or tomato as the base along with cumin, black pepper and dry chilli powder as flavoring ingredients). Was disappointed that the bone soup was very lukewarm. They had the usual savory fritters (pakora), paper dosa, parotta (layered flatbread, very soft, buttery and tasty!), chicken chettinad (rich brown gravy), vegetarian choices, curd rice, papad (thin crisp disc shaped accompaniments, made from lentils), choice of two Indian desserts: gulab jamun (literally rose plums :) made by frying dough balls and then steeped in syrup) plus payasum (a classic rice pudding made by boiling rice, or vermicelli with milk and sugar) also available is ice cream. I do like that they offer fresh cut fruits as well. I topped this off with very classic Madras coffee (flavored with chicory), served in a piping hot steel tumbler. Recommended!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy, very authentic South Indian ambiance style place - this would be one recommendation. Allows one to relive the experience, the sounds, constant ins and outs. Heavily laden with spices food, a variety of seafood, chicken ,mutton (goat), vegetarian dishes can be found. Be careful of timings as they close - even though the website may state it is open. Service can be spotty but that is how things work back in the old country."}
{"text":"Glad to find such a nice South Indian restaurant in Brampton. Orderer the ultra spicy dosa, it was killer but very tasty. The place is clean and staff is friendly.   Recommended"}
