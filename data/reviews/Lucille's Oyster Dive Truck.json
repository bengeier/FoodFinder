{"text":"Overrated, the roll was pricy and though there were pretty large chunks of lobster, it wasn't super flavourful or exciting. Unfortunately not many places have lobster rolls so if you're craving one I guess go here, it isn't terrible it just isn't great either"}
{"text":"Guedille de homard en bouffe de rue ? Que demande le peuple ? xD

J'ai eu l'occasion de tester ce truck pendant Bouffon Montréal, c'était une bonne expérience se balader dans le festival en mangeant sa guedille de Homard. Ça change, j'ai plus l'habitude de voir le homard dans une belle assiette dans les restaurant chic's (donc pas souvent testé car cher).

Ici elle est tout de même à 10$ mais c'est bon, vraiment. J'ai aimé ça même si j'en prendrai pas tout les jours contrairement à d'autres trucks.

Mais c'est à essayer une fois =) au moins."}
{"text":"Starting this review with a bang: Deliiiiiiiiiish.

I tasted the Lobster Roll and the Ribs. A huge fan of both. Ribs will have you licking your fingers due to their amazing marinating sauce, and it's tender, so so tender. Lobster Roll was alright, it's too creamy for my taste but it is definitely worth it.

I never tried the other stuff because I went late and things were limited.

But will definitely return.

{"text":"I live in NDG, so had been to Lucille's a few times before, which is really amazing, but a tad overpriced for me.

Anyhow, I was surprised to find they had a food truck yesterday while we were walking around drinking beer downtown. We ordered two crispy fish tacos, and they were so damn yummy. Really good. I wanna go back and find it. haha"}
{"text":"Une guédille de homard classique, goûteuse à souhait! Il faut quand même être prêt à débourser 12$ pour un format pain hot-dog..."}
{"text":"Was a good Lobster Roll, as expected. There is 2 places for a decent Lobster Roll in the city now, MuvBox in the Old Port, and Lucille's.

MuvBox at 9$, and Lucille's at 10$. Your choice

Given the choice i think i would head to Old Montreal, even though i did enjoy Lucille's version, i think i preferred MuvBox's."}
