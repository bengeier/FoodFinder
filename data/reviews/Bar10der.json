{"text":"I always went to the Scarbrough location until they closed it, but I never knew there was one in East york. I would only go on Thursday cause of friends and Karaoke. I will check out the East York location one day, I wonder if the waitresses work there from the Scarborough location?"}
{"text":"Went to the East York Bar10der as we were annoyed w/ the Scarborough location. This one was a lot better in terms of service & also the quality of food. We were strictly here for UFC & ordered from their special UFC menu (Souvlaki sticks & wings). I don't know why we were only allowed to order from that UFC menu cuz they could prob earn more $ including the regular menu for UFC nights. Oh well ...not going to educate them :)   This place was sorta packed so go early! Would come back again for UFC nights!  The tvs are smaller here but they had a few around the room. The Scarborough location is only good for its big screen tv."}
{"text":"The very fact that this place has a five star review makes me shiver. I should say that I did not try the nachos which apparently earned them such an accolade but I doubt they would have made up for the mess that is this place.  Let's start with the nice shall we?  -The restaurant itself was visually nice and very clean - There were five big screen TVs scattered around the bar making it easy to watch \"the game\" -The service was a bit scattered but the waitress was nice.  Now for the bad... - The food is terrible.  I ordered a burger with fries and gravy. The gravy was disgusting and my burger bun was super soggy before I even took my first bite. My friend's chicken fingers were not much better and tasted like garlic powder (which I assume is in the batter) - They didn't carry two of the three beers we asked for (even though they have giant posters for those beers). Apparently they stopped carrying a whole bunch of beers this summer but never bothered to take down the signs. - Our waitress was sweet but super scattered. She spent a good portion of her time in the back talking with the cooks or on her cell phone. When orders did come out she forgot cutlery, condiments and my gravy. - The debit machine doesn't take chip cards  I would probably come here again just for a drink to watch a game but next time I think I'll skip the food."}
