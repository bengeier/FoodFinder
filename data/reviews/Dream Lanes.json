{"text":"Just got home from our first visit there with friends. The place is not that bad, shoes seem a bit old but passable. Balls are not organized by weight but a bit of searching and you'll get what you need.  We had a very bad customer service experience. Their website has coupons you can print and take with you. We were standing near the counter and trying to decide to use the 2 hours for the price of one or the bogo discounts. The guy at the counter said we could start bowling and they would us the coupon that was less expensive when we were done.  We kept our eyes on the lock and after a while decided we'd use the two hours for the price of one option. The problem is that when we went to pay there was a different guy at the counter. He told us the hourly option was pre-pay only. He made no effort to help us out and was really quite disagreable.  This is unfortunate. We live within walking distance but have always gone to Villiage Lanes in Monona. The customer service there is much better... steer clear of Dream Lanes."}
{"text":"If I could select zero I would have. Nothing wrong with the bowling alley, the staff just sucks. Pick another spot to have your event /party/whatever. The staff are extremely rude and not very accommodating. Prices are a bit high too. It kind of explains why nobody comes here."}
{"text":"This bowling alley is all fine and good. I will return. Generally, Dream Lanes is not a very up to date building, technology or bathrooms...but all in all, gets the job done for a good night in bowling. My boyfriends new bowling ball was chipped in their lane, and they fixed it for free in just  a few days and it was good as new. I give them a three because i did have a bad experience once while checking out with a coupon. They made a really big deal about how i couldn't use the coupon since i hadn't printed it out. I was trying to use it by showing them my phone. I think this also shows that they are out of date. Rates are competitive for Madison."}
{"text":"$8 2-hour unlimited bowling specials (shoes included) on the weekends after 8:30. Pretty decent place but definitely shows its age. I have not tried the food but everyone else around were eating something. I saw a lot of pizzas which looked decent.  My one complaint would be that it is hard to find bowling balls with the weight I want and holes large enough for adult hands."}
{"text":"I don't believe it!  No reviews for Dream Lanes.  I get to do another first!    Well I used to bowl here a bunch and I can say that they have a good amount of lanes and we never had a problem with anything there.  There was always a good crowd there and a pretty nice clientele.   They did their best to stay out of our way and offered some great deals for the bowling groups through which I got a new ball and some nice new shoes.   Close to five starts but I don't review bowling alleys too much so I don't have a lot to compare them to.  They were good to me."}
{"text":"If listening to hot jams from the 90s and 2000s while enjoying unlimited bowling for two hours (including shoe rental) for $9 sounds like a great time to you, you will love Dream Lanes on the weekends.   It had been years since I'd been bowling and Dream Lanes seemed a step up from the last place I went. Tables are labeled with what lane they belong to, you can change your score screen's theme, nothing seemed grimy or sticky, and the staff was friendly and helpful.   During the weekend deal with unlimited bowling you can win prizes if you get a strike when a red pin is in the front center position. I managed to bowl a strike on my first roll, but sadly the pin was not in front. Booooo.   At Dream Lanes I had the same problem I have at every bowling alley - not being able to find a light ball with larger finger holes. I have no upper body strength so I prefer an 8 or 10 pound ball, but they are generally drilled with the fingers of children and delicate ladies in mind. My thumb barely fit so I had some really awkward throws where the ball stuck for half a second before releasing - you could hear the pop as the seal broke.   Give me some ball choices for my sausage fingers/weak arms body type and I might just bump it up to a five-star experience!"}
{"text":"I really like this bowling alley. Despite what time I've gone, it's been active with bowlers of all ages. They are super family friendly and are very reasonable with prices. For 3 adults to bowl 1 game, I paid $21. Not a bad price at all. Order pizza and a refill gallon drink from Pizza Pit for $17 to get your belly full while you're bowling. Again, great price.  I do think that there is room for improvement . The alley, facility,  is very outdated and you cant get any Internet connection in your cell phone when you're inside which I why I give them 3 stars.   Aside from that, I love bowling here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"New tv screens, recently redone floors, and a friendly staff keep us coming back. Nice food selections from Pizza  Pit better than average pizza for an alley."}
{"text":"It was the day after Christmas and bitter cold out so the gathered family from around the country need something to do.  So bowling it was and we  were not too surprised there was a place within a couple miles of our in-laws place (we were in Wisconsin after all).  It was not too crowded when we arrived and the front desk staff was helpful getting our big group set up with lanes and shoes.  The bumpers and ramps worked well for small kids so the whole experience was great fun for everyone.  I am only sorry that we were not more hungry so I could have seen if the Pizza Pit pizza is what I remember from the dorms decades ago..."}
