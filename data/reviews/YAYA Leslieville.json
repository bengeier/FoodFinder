{"text":"We had the Avocado Benny, the stuffed French Toast, and the open-face chicken sandwich.

First off, we totally just bumbled in here one Monday morning because why the hell not. It had a good atmosphere and our server was an older gentleman that would have fit in perfectly in the Godfather movie. He gets ALL my stars. He was so courteous, simply the best! 

The Avocado Benny was good, but we were rather puzzled as to why the eggs weren't poached. Yes the eggs are very orange, but I've had organic eggs that were even more orange and so it did not throw me off.

The French Toast REALLY is TO's best!! Ok, maybe not the best since I've not had all the french toast that TO has had to offer, but it is really, really, really good. The slice of bread is perfectly eggy and the filling, the vanilla with just a dash of zest, so light and heavy at the same time. It was delicious. Not to mention the side of berries, I don't know how they got such great berries in the winter, but the strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries are TOP SHELF. So tasty and not at all tart!

My open-faced chicken sandwich was probably the least amusing. I don't eat spicy, so I opted for not spicy spinach, but they just ixnay'd it completely. The toast was hard, and the hummus seemed like it was dried on there, but it was ok. Just ok. One small piece of toast on a plate, I was surprised they didn't put some greens on the side to make it look less bare. Two older ladies sat by us and complained about the portion size, which I actually didn't have a problem with. Yes, probably more on the smaller side of things, but it was just right for me. We're not supposed to eat ridiculously large portions and I left feeling satiated and not bloated.

Seriously, LOVED THE SERVER. He was the best!

{"text":"Yummy! Been here twice and had a great experience both times.

Had the sexy avocado benedict, it was absolutely worth the upgrade! The farm fresh eggs are sunny side up and very orange. And the guacamole blends in nicely with the potatoes and crispy tortilla chips.

It's a small place and they only have two people serving so it can be a bit slow when all the tables are full."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and very underrated. Great food, great service, breezy space, it's perfect."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Super friendly owners and the avocado benedict was great. What else can you ask for on a nice weekend afternoon?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went this morning. We made an 11:30 reservation but still had to wait 15 min..Pretty much until the next table opened up. That's where the negatives finished! I ordered the stuffed French toast..WOW it was delicious! The filling was perfect with just the right amount of sweetness and lemon flavour. Thoroughly enjoyed it! My husband ordered the spicy Mexican eggs which is pretty much a spicy omelette on a bed of tortilla chips with sour cream, salsa and guac. He enjoyed it as well! Fresh squeezed OJ, organic coffee (with free refills), and delicious YAYA hash (potatoes) were the perfect additions. Service wasn't bad..considering how busy it was. We were too busy enjoying the food anyways!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews. They have redone the decor since they took over from Leslieville diner days.  Bright and clean. Lots of wait staff. I was getting takeout but they were hustling to take care of everyone.  I called ahead and they said 15 minutes and when I arrived 15 minutes later my order was ready.  We had the Avacado Benedict and the Monte Cristo with a side of sweet potato fries that came with garlic aioli.  Everything was excellent.  The Avacado Benedict had a nice little kick to it and it was perfectly flavourfull.  The monte Cristo was huge and in fact the portions for everything we had were on the large side. If it didn't taste so darn good I would have only eaten half and saved the rest for later."}
{"text":"Cozy family-friendly restaurant. Immediately greeted by a nice man in a suit. I hadn't made a reservation but we were seated immediately. Service was friendly. Big fan of the French toast - stuffed with lemon mascarpone!! Be sure to try their homemade halloumi!!"}
{"text":"Nae Nae to Yaya

Okaaaay. How did we get here. 

Yaya has been recommended to me by a friend (the friendship status is under performance review) and i was really excited because their menu online seems really great.

I ordered, the French Toast, the Monte Cristo sandwich, side of poached eggs, hasbrown and a biscuit.

The french toast came first and well. It wasnt too bad. The lemon cottage filling was a bit blend but the  read was crisp and tasty.  Then...

The biscuit. A dry, blend piece of cardboard. 

The poached eggs come. And they were cook to hell even tho i ask for medium soft. The waitress start arguing with me about how poached eggs are cook. And well. Google prove me right (thanks the internet)

I then attack the monte cristo sandwiches. A cheddar bacon sweet onion and dijon mustard on brioche breadseem pretty interesting. But it was quite bad. Just a bad flavour mix here. The dijon with the sweet bread doesnt work. Its mushy filled with barely cooked onion. Disapointing.

Hashbrown were soft and blend. Not enjoyable.

Overall yaya is not even reaching the average toronto brunch level. And i wonder what is the chef doing and why people are still going there."}
{"text":"Finally made it to YAYA after almost a year in the East End - it's been on my list to try.

Verdict: Such a charming & lovely place with good food. Loved the staff and vibe. Enjoyed the most relaxing Sunday brunch outside on the mini front patio. 

Food: I ordered the Avocado Benedict - they were cute (first observation, as they come smiling at you)! Taste-wise, they are good. Traditional Benny's? Definitely not. Doesn't have that rich, usual hollandaise sauce. The base was made of potato hash and avocado. So on the lighter side (vs. English muffins). But it's a good breakfast. Very homey.

Note: My friend had the classic Benedict. They were served on scones (vs. English muffins). She didn't enjoy that part. Not sure I'd like scones as the base either.

So overall, Yaya is a lovely cute neighbourhood  brunch place. Probably akin to a brunch your Yaya (grandma) would make for you. Simple and homey :)"}
{"text":"Walked in here on a saturday for a nice brunch. The place is buzzing with life and the vibe is amazing. The service was outstanding and the food was really good. I had the yaya breakfast and couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"We happened upon YAYA when shopping for our pup just next door. The smell and vibe brought us in. As it was a sunny day, we sat outside. But because we sat at the table for two, we were overlooked a bit. Not to dwell. I ordered the Avocado Benny and it was so good. My only issue with it was that I wanted more. It was so mouth-wateringly tasty and delicious. I'm so happy I didn't order anything else on the menu. 
Very friendly staff and we were happy when they brought out water for the pooch and let her sit with us."}
{"text":"Loved the vegan Benedict!  And the chips and guacamole are yummy. Good vibe at lunch and Sat brunch.  But they don't take debit cards."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday to try out the place as the previous restaurant, Leslieville Diner, used to be my weekly place to grab food for take out but sadly closed down.  Once in the door I was quickly greeted by the waitress, sat down and asked for the menu for takeout.
I ordered the all american burger with home fries, brought it home and as I opened up the container I was disappointed to see the teeny weenie size of the burger, the taste was 'meh' nothing really special or tasty about it and as for the home fries, parts of it was cooked  while others was undercooked.  The reason for two stars instead of one was the incredible, friendly and attentive service I received while waiting for my food.
Was really hoping this place would be my new weekly restaurant but sadly I have to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Time for brunch! I rarely brunch, but today was the day. Randomly ended up at Yaya's on a Sunday afternoon. It boasts using farm fresh and local ingredients. Sounds good! A quaint place with a raised seating area by the window. What made me love this place was the TV with a fireplace on the screen. A little corny, but still kinda awesome. 

I cannot say no to Eggs Benedict($14) or coffee($2), so the choice was easy. The coffee was a little strong, but good. Organic and fair trade, of course! Brunch arrived looking fabulous. After my plate's quick photo session, I dug in, but did not anticipate this little surprise; the yolk was bright ORANGE. Confused, I tasted it and it tasted like egg yolk, but certainly looked like it had come from a psychedelic chicken.

We asked about the yolk and they don't know why it's orange. She said the owner picks up the eggs fresh every day directly from the farm. They assume because the chickens are grain fed all organic feed, that it affects the colour. Interesting. I feel like I should've seen orange yolk in my 30-something years of eating eggs.  

It all tasted fantastic, regardless of the freaky looking eggs. The housemade hollandaise sauce was perfect; not full of salt, just creamy goodness. The peameal bacon didn't even need a knife. So good! The homefries and greens were also very good.  

It was refreshing to be at a restaurant all organic/free range/fair trade that wasn't insanely expensive. The prices were comparable to restaurants that were not organic. This just shows that organic doesn't HAVE to cost more, Yaya's proved it. 

Would love to go back! Brunch is starting to sound pretty good now!"}
{"text":"I wandered in on a mid-week afternoon with a colleague. We were warmly greeted and seated at a table for 2 by the window.  Nice view onto Queen St. E, clean & cozy dining room. Service was fast, friendly and efficient, prices are reasonable and the food was delicious.  I had the Avocado Benny w/kale salad, a fair & healthy portion size.  I've revisited several times subsequent with: my sisters, daughter, niece and we've always had a pleasant dining experience.

Christina the owner, chef even came out to introduce herself the first time, and always remembers me each time I revisit."}
{"text":"Tried YAYA for the 2nd time, this time was brunch, first time was for lunch when they first opened. We both had had the lentil soup, nothing special. Because of that i wasnt in a rush to get back for brunch. When I did go back, we had both ordered the avocado benny. Was an interesting concept but I found it a bit bland. Would rather have had a bit of hollandaise (or something) on top to spice it up a bit. And maybe toast instead of natchos. I will definitely try it again, only maybe go back for the french toast or an omelette. Service was fairly quick considering how busy they were."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant! Friendly, small and cozy! Had the avocado Benedict and it was delish... Very different. Sunny side farm fresh eggs, on top of spinach, cubed potatoes and avocado with a hit of heat! My friend had the stuffed French toast... Also delicious... Lighter than you think... I will be coming back here again and again!!"}
{"text":"This place is packed on Sundays! Came a little after the lunch rush around 1pm.

Service is amazing! The staff are friendly and engaging, and the food didn't take long to arrive at our tables either.

Tried the Chicken Souvlaki which had an interesting taste with both hummus and tzatziki, despite the chicken being on the drier side. Definitely need to try one of the gourmet breakfast items next time."}
{"text":"Just driving by looking for breakfast and stumbled on this place - great find!

They offer really tasty, well prepared locally sourced fare with plenty of gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options to satisfy almost everybody who likes food. We had the Avocado Benny and the Sweet Potato Brava. Both are excellent dishes, focusing on flavour, texture and the high quality of the ingredients.
Service is prompt and friendly, food is great, prices are reasonable for this quality fare - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! 
It was a rainy day in Leslieville....we wandered in here and were greeted by warm staff and a great menu. Both me and my partner had bennies, the avocado and the classic. They were tasty and just the right portions. 
At the end the owner came by with a baklava serving for each of us on the house! They were delicious and the perfect size to end a meal with a sweet taste but not be overstuffed. He welcomed us, joked around and made us feel like it was a family vibe.
Great experience, thank you :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast/brunch spot! You can tell their ingredients are fresh and they know what to do with them! I had the stuffed French toast which was light but delicious. My husband had the lean burger which was simple and delicious...amazing brioche bun. The owner/hostess was so pleasant and welcoming. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"very quaint brunch spot - something about the hardwood flooring, fish tank aquarium channel on the tv, and avocado-lined window sill make me feel comfortable here. not pretentious, family-friendly, and really good ambient music. 

avocado benny and the french toast are my go-tos - can always expect fresh ingredients and know exactly what i'm getting each time. 

polite staff and the same, kind man in a suit has been here all 4-5 times - adds to the charming personality of this place =)"}
{"text":"This new breakfast/lunch/brunch business in the former digs of Leslieville Diner, and it's a world of diffidence.

Currently a relatively limited menu, however the two things sampled where both very good, that would be the Chicken Parm and the Avocado Benny, the highlights for both being the sauce.  People that don't think using local ingredients in their food makes a difference should try the food here, obviously not everything is local, don't think I've seen a Avocado tree anywhere in southern Ontario....

Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"Slow. Bad food. It's like this family owned restaurant wasn't interested in owning a restaurant. The patriarch, clad in his oversized suit and tie, milled around chatting with customers, assumedly to charm them. But when there's people waiting, maybe help out a little. And the son and daughter obviously had somewhere better to be and couldn't be bothered to bring over (bad) coffee or cutlery. Crummy decor, terrible music, and underwhelming food, go somewhere else on the strip to eat brunch."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. My husband and I both got the avocado benedicts with poached eggs. The yolk was super yellow, almost orange, indicting that they really used organic eggs. 
I love meat but this vegan dish blew me away! I was so full but not super full. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of brunch spots in this neighborhood, however we stumbled upon this one while strolling in the area.  This is a cute cozy brunch spot with good food to boost.  I had the YAYA breakfast (your regular egg, sausage and hash), and have to say the eggs were exceptional (perfectly done and just different than the usual I have had).  The turkey sausages were delicious as well.  Portion size was perfect for me, however those with bigger appetites might feel it is on the smaller size."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 stars establishment.

I like how they converted the previously Leslieville Diner into a more modern and clean looking brunch spot in the neighbourhood.

The atmosphere feels jovial and upbeat while the menu is compact but offers enough variety to appeal to the brunch crowd.  The windows let me lots of sunlight and they had a video fireplace roaring on a TV near the back.

I decided to go for the toasted monte cristo sandwich which arrived between two large slices of toasted challah bread I believe.  I really enjoyed it but was more intrigued by the stuff french toast my friend ordered.

Service was really casual, friendly, and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time here for breakfast. Without any doubt, this is the best breakfast place in the city. The food is absolutely delicious. Last week I had the regular eggs and bacon and this week I had the eggs benedict. A friend with me had the stuffed French toast and it too was delicious and tasty. I will continue to enjoy this restaurant every weekend as this is my new favorite breakfast place. If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Check it out, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"As promised, tried this spot again and have to see, very consistent with my previous review. Service is friendly and attentive. Not sure I ordered right- frittata was pretty mediocre, sausages were low quality store bought. 

I am a brunch snob and expect more."}
{"text":"This is a cozy restaurant with nice ambience and no line up on a Sunday morning. I was a bit disappointed by the Avacado Benedict since there was no hollandaise sauce, but the eggs themselves were good, and complinented the rest of the meal, the avacado was underneath the potatoes which is a bit weird and counter intuitive. The freshly squeezed orange juice is standard. Overall, it's a solid 3.5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"After seeing BLOGTOs review on their french toast, it became on my to go list!
Showing up on a Sunday morning around noon, I was able to snag the last table (although they do take reservations which is rare for a brunch place on the east end ).
I was treated by a man in a suit and tie... He was probably one of the owners but I think the place is a mom and pop shop, all from the same fam. Their service could be described as overly attentive because we were asked the same questions by different people multiple times. Some people might find it annoying but on this chill Sunday, I thought it was really caring.

While I really wanted the French toast, I was also craving something savoury as well, so my friend and I shared an order of the avocado benedict. All dishes range between $10-$15 and there is a side board with $5 dishes. They also have $5 glasses of wine and organic beer that really can't be beat.

Our food was presented really nicely.. As far as brunch gets. The egg yolks were bright and enormous, sitting on bed of spinach, potatoes, and avocado. Maybe I read wrong but I didn't realize that potatoes were part of the dish, given that tortilla chips was included as an accompaniment. I did find that the potatoes were too much, and not enough avocado... I also found very little spinach, but I appreciate the inventiveness in the overall composition.

Our French toast dish had been sitting for some time and the waitress offered to reheat it for us because it had gooey ricotta cheese stuffed inside. We we so greatful that she checked on us because it made all the difference. The ricotta was a creamy with lemon flavour, but I didn't find it to be overly heavy. It actually reminded me to Chinese style French toast, with the giant thick toast, but with a western twist. I would recommend everyone to try this once if they visit YAYA.

Despite staying almost 3 hours and having waves of people come in, and waiting for a seat, we were never rushed out.

No doubt that this is a lace to check out...minus the crazy east side line ups, with great food and service.
Keep it up"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We were \"Greeted\" by a grumpy waiter that reluctantly came to serve us. We ordered the special - fried chicken and pancakes. The chicken was extremely dry and not to mention that the portion was tiny for $16. \"Freshly squeezed\" juice was out of a regular juice box for $5. That's not OK. Will not recommend, which is a shame because we like the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The owners son kept asking me if I wanted a photo copier for my business while I was eating awkward"}
{"text":"Cute little place with very friendly and warm service. Ordered avocado eggs benedict. Was litte disappointed with the hollandaise sauce because I like it creamy. Would definitely visit again but will try something else next time"}
{"text":"Service was bad and they do not follow through on reservations.  I had a group of 4 reserved for 12pm. We arrived at 11:55am but were not seated until 12:40pm! 
Just before we were seated, a waitress (the daughter of the owner) apologized for the wait and said that our drinks would be free and that the food would be \"worth the wait\". 
My bf and his mom each ordered a ceasar and my mom and I just had tap water (we like to drink water and weren't trying to take advantage of the \"free drinks\" offer). When the bill came out, we were charged for the 2 Caesars. I asked if the drinks were supposed to be free and her response was \"oh, I meant if you guys ordered coffee, not other drinks\"... Rage... She never mentioned that the free drinks were just for coffee. 
We all looked at her in surprise and then she said that she could take 1 of the drinks off of the bill.  Since I was with my mom and my boyfriends mom, I didn't make a fuss about it. 
To top it off, the food was NOT WORTH THE WAIT. I'm not saying that because of the horrible service and lies.  The food was just mediocre and there are way better places to eat on Queen East with better service, better food, and are able to actually keep your reservation. 
Also, after we were seated and about to order, we were then told that we have to switch tables to accommodate a large group who weren't even there yet!!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience at this place, went there a couple weeks ago for a brunch with friends after work, service was VERY slow going the family seems like they don't want to be there, very unmotivated people, the son kept coming up to our table and talking to us while we eat to tell us how good the restaurant is, very uncomfortable! I will not return"}
{"text":"Great brunch here. I always get the eggs in potato and avocado and spicy spinach with tortilla chips
It's awesome"}
{"text":"I walk to work every day and I always pass YAYA, today my friends and I decided to go. We went for some brunch. Very nice traditional dishes as well as basic and easy to understand specials.

The food was good, however it was not worth the 45 minute wait, after waiting 15 minutes to get a menu. People who came in after us were getting served food first and they ordered after us, my friend ordered the breakfast grilled cheese, my other friend ordered the YAYA Breakfast and I got a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich with home fries. Probably the most easiest and effortless things to make!! 

Two stars because; we shouldn't have waited 15 minutes for a menu and drinks, and certainly not worth the wait. The food was delicious and I did enjoy all aspects of the breakfast sandwich, I will remember to ask for cheese next time. Home fries were a hit!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick bite.  Service was friendly and the food was excellent.  My dining companion had the eggs Benedict and found it to be delicious -- \"flavorful and cheesy goodness\" was his description.   I had the egg and bacon breakfast sandwich which was done perfectly.  I especially enjoyed the maple flavored bacon. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday around 11am, was able to sit immediate since it was not packed yet at that time.

However, we waited 10mins to order coz they seemed short in staff, only a lady and a guy working around. 

We ordered avocado Benny, Yaya breakfast and Kale salad. 

It took a good 30min until we got our food. 

But the food was delicious. The kale salad was beyond expectation (usually I don't order salad for brunch, but I was glad I did today! ) 

The avocado Benny was great, with the potato and avocado \"cuddled\" together. 

The only thing was it lack some flavour.

All in all, I gave 4 stars for the food, 3stars for the service, and 4stars for the friendly attitude:)"}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians, plus gluten free options are available. This place is pricer than most places I've been too but the food was delicious. I had the Avocado Benedict; base was avocado and potatoes, topped with spinach and egg. Comes with tortilla chips and spinach. Free refills on coffee."}
