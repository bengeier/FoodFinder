{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here with a family member. Food is excellent, just like at the other Drake restaurants. Very cool atmosphere.  Menu items are a bit pricey for the area, but in my opinion, the taste is worth the cost.   Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Darla B. Second visit --likely last --portions very small and pricey -- soup came in a large bowl and the soup barely filled  the bottom of the bowl  ---very deceptive for the price  the open faced sandwich was on  a tiny piece of rye with lots of topping but needed at least one more of their tiny bread slices to spread the topping --when I asked server for a second slice she replied '' we dont give away our bread ''  bad answer --wont be back"}
{"text":"I popped in for breakfast and was very disappointed to learn that the only offerings sans cheese and cream were a muffin or a plain bagel w butter (that they asked $12 for). The young buck at the cash admitted he didn't know much but still. I was surprised he wasn't more helpful (ask a coworker? A manager?). At these prices, I was also pretty shocked they couldn't make a breakfast sandwich to order without cheese. Another overpriced Toronto fail in my opinion. Sad to see this city lose its soul to overpriced overhyped hoopla. Head up to Dundas West for amazing fare at a competitive price point."}
{"text":"We had a delicious brunch here at the Drake Commissary.  Food was delicious - fresh and zippy tastes.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"\"Eatery, Bakery, Bar, Larder\" - an amaing combination in my neighborhood.The design of the place is fabulous, parking is non-existent, service is friendly but not professional and the food is hit and miss and extremely overpriced.    On my first visit soon after they opened it was very disorganized. They were out of the two salads I was going to order for dinner so I decided to eat elsewhere. There was a reduced price on their morning pastries so I got some to go along with a slice of the lemon tart which was incredible....beautiful pastry and tangy sweet lemon curd filling.    My second visit was yesterday - for take out for two meals.    The broccolini salad had green beans, ancho, garlic and peanuts (incredibly good just needed more dressing - not sure what dressing it did have, if any) @ $12  The Ontario squash salad @ $14 had a MINISCULE amount of 'air-dried ham' - it was almost funny.  A big amount of the skin on squash and a teaspoon maybe of the ricotta salata which was tasteless.  It was supposed to have muscatel but I couldn't detect it.  The salad had no flavorings or dressing so basically it was just steamed squash with a tiny garnish of ricotta salata and shaved ham.  The squash was good and I found myself really really wishing that it had flavorings and dressings that you would expect with a salad.  The brisket sandwich @ $14 was okay but ridiculously overpriced.  Two pieces of bun, tiny amount of brisket, a spoonful of fermented cabbage and a smear of \"horseradish creme, arugula, and mustard\" looking stuff on each bun.  DRY and not worth the price by a long shot.  It should have at least came with a side of some type.    Butter tarts @$5 with the pastry tasting like chewy leather and the filling with a texture and taste like mashed sweet potatoes.  This was the most horrifying food I have ever purchased - I had to throw it out.  It's hard to understand how the same place can put out a lemon tart that is like heaven with a flaky crisp pastry and sublime filling - and then even dare to offer garbage like this butter tart?????  Their lemon blueberry muffin was good though.  I couldn't taste much lemon but there were lots of blueberries and the top had a nice crispy to it and the interior was very moist.  Not sure how they were able to open this place with just a couple of parking spots.  It's a long walk in the winter to street parking if the place is busy and the couple of spots allocated to the restaurant's customers are taken.  And a lot of the front are spots are marked for staff.  This place desperately needs to be less stingy with portion sizes, seasonings and sauces.  And if they can't produce a decent butter tart they need to take it off the menu!"}
{"text":"Didn't start off as I was hoping for. Firstly, I had a reservation for 11:45am - arrived early, and the hostess said it'd be ready shortly. 10mins past, and clearly having a reservation didn't matter. Being seated at 11:55am wasn't the issue, more so why make a reservation if the table won't even be ready by then - it wasn't even busy.  Also, the seating arrangements here are tight to say the least.. barely any arm room, or leg room. Maybe we just got the short end of the stick.  Another note: the waitress was cleaning the table next to mine and sprayed the cleaning solution a my arm. Like come on..   Washroom had no soap - even though it was \"checked\" 15mins before I went in.   I'm done: Pros: the food Cons: everything else"}
{"text":"Cool place but the service is shit. My late night charcuterie board takes longer than the steak frites I had for dinner.... think about that for a second... No one really seems to give a shit about paying attention to the customers. Eye avoidance must be something that is trained with the employees here. Also, Ive attached a pic of their late night charcuterie board. Holy fuck... really? If I just wanted ham and salami I would have gone to Safeway. Such a marginal effort here. Couldn't even beg the staff for my bill while they were busy closing the bar."}
{"text":"Best buckwheat sourdough . $6.50 amazing octopus and wonderful vibe. I love this place. It's on the West Toronto Railpath so mAkes for a great evening including a walk and a visit to Hendersons Brewery"}
{"text":"The evening had a rocky start with about 20% of the menu items not available.  One of our orders (family chicken) was started in the grill later than it should have resulting in a longer wait...BUT the folks at the Drake made up for it many times over by: 1) compensating appetizers 2) even offering free dessert! 3) other wallet friendly savings  The staff was amazing and our waitress was probably the one who really made it a point to value our time and patronage.  Hats off for an awesome recovery."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying there is very very limited parking here, and coming for lunch on a weekday, I didn't expect to not be able to find a spot. Street parking was also packed, so I had to park quite far.  I ordered their brisket sandwich and it was 5/5 perfect pretzel bun, melt in your mouth brisket, and slaw combination. I didn't have a chance to try anything else because I wasn't very hungry, but picked up some croissants to go which appear to be delicious.  Pricing is a little on the high side, I'd expect them to have more fresh juices available vs. the village juicery's offerings- which are delicious but can be found everywhere these days. Overall, although the decor is nice, I don't think there's anything unique on the menu to make me go out of my way to come back here. I think I'll stick to the regular outpost, but it was fun to check out this once."}
{"text":"Avoid coming here for brunch at all costs. The place was packed and the servers were overwhelmed. Our server took our orders immediately and got us the wrong drinks. 2 hours later (no exaggeration) he comes and checks on us for the first time and is surprised that we don't have our food yet. At this point we were starving and just decided to get a croissant from a nearby café then continue on with the day. He still charged us for the wrong drinks and offered a slew of apologies - he had obviously forgot to put our food order through. We had asked for avocado toast which was flying out to all of the other tables in a steady flow from the kitchen.  Really put me off of this place - the number of times I have been here the place has been packed full of screaming people. It's not a very nice ambiance for an outing where you actually would like to converse with someone sitting next to you."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. With any new restaurant, there are some kinks that still need to be resolved.   The good ... Despite some other reviews, I found the prices reasonable. The restaurant style is small portions which is nice because you can try multiple menu items. The menu itself is varied and includes, sandwiches, salads, breads and dips, pizza, etc. which can easily accommodate a range of eating preferences. As you would expect from the Drake, the restaurant is chic with thoughtful and artistic decor. The restaurant is huge with different rooms and a bakery at the front, couches and a patio. I loved the sourdough bread and hummus, chicken curry sandwich and salads.  They gave us 2 free photos in the retro photo booth because we were celebrating a birthday. Also great that there's free parking at the front.   The bad ... The service left much to be desired. Upon sitting down, the waitress walked us through the menu and once she took our orders, she vanished. We had asked that the food be brought out in rounds since we were sharing multiple dishes and had a smaller table. Unfortunately, they took this too literally and waited 30-40 minutes between our three rounds of food. They were slow to bring water and to check up on us. As some of the food is already prepared, they were not able to accommodate substitutions. The restaurant is also very loud! We ordered all of the vegetables and they were all disappointing with the exception of the potatoes.   We complained that the food took too long and they offered us free dessert which we declined. They took off our first round of food, which amounted to $47. We really appreciated the gesture.   Overall, has potential. I wasn't blown away by the food but I loved the atmosphere and would be willing to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Drake Commissary. It is really cute and if you're not careful, you could definitely miss it, as it is tucked away in an industrial area, but I loved it and can't wait to go back. My friends and I dined here for a birthday dinner, and it was super easy to make a reservation (yay for accepting OpenTable resos) and we were able to bring in a cake for our friend's birthday.  I loved the vibe/feel of the place. They have a cool counter up front where they have pizza and other take-out goods. I had a really great salad (unfortunately I forget the name of it, but they have since changed their menu --- another super cool thing!) and miso cauliflower that was really good. We also got a cheese board to share which was nice. The staff are really nice, really helpful, and really cool! I recommend it."}
{"text":"I have now had the opportunity to dine in, and From the look of it every table is unique not unlike the menu which seems to have different desert options on different days. For example they only had 2 of the 5 deserts that I've tried before, this leads me to conclude they have deserts of the day. But I Digress. I ordered the brisket sandwich for myself and the Drake XO pizza for my mom. I had a bite of her pizza and don't think I can look at normal pizza the same again. This pizza though topped with ingredients I would only describe as odd on a pizza, was remarkably good, not the best I've had  but good. The brisket sandwich on the other hand is remarkably good, warmed up perfectly and healthy too!"}
{"text":"Awful service (charged for still italian water that wasn't ordered...), awful old fashioned (tasted watered down), mediocre small portion food at a high cost. Stay away."}
{"text":"An excellent option in the junction triangle. Pate and bread is delicious. Jerk chicken is surprisingly awesome. Brisket sandwich is da bomb. However whatever you order, get the side potatoes to make your day!"}
{"text":"This is a really awesome drake extension. It's far enough away from the downtown core that it's a destination but also close enough to the city that your friends shouldn't complain.   The Commissary has an awesome, classic Drake atmosphere. Beautifully furnished rooms and gorgeous food.  There are basically 3 sections to the restaurant - an order-up to-go counter. A sit down dine-in area. And an adorable work-from-home office space with grab & go foods ready to bring home for dinner.   I'd totally recommend working here from home or grabbing a coffee & snack if you need somewhere to chill for a couple hours in the area. I had a delicious Pineapple-Mango Coconut Chia Seed bowl for breakfast with no complaints. 'd love to see how the atmosphere changes at night."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich is to die for. Friendly waiters. Priced ok. a tad high but lots of reno happening so I get it. Generous portions. Kinda loud....but I'm getting old."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6 persons at 5:30 on Saturday after seeing the Banksy show. We were shown to our seats pretty quickly and ordered right away. Then we were ignored for about 1/2 hour. We asked for water and bread and humus and it came after a while. We saw people arriving after us and being served,  we complained and were told the food was coming, things seemed a bit chaotic, then the waiter changed and the new waiter, Pat, was more helpful. Our food order came around 7:15, after almost 2 hours. It was a family outing, we were chatting and \"bonding\", but I regret not to have walked out. The food was just Ok: brisket sandwich, Kale salad, Niçoise salad, Chanterelles pasta, and a tray of charcuterie with grilled veggies. The bread was good. We had tickets for an 8pm Luminato event and we inhaled our food, took a Uber and barely made it. We won't come back."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great food, big portions, recently priced. The workers are also attentive. Some of the dishes are dishes you can really imagine Drake eating lol."}
{"text":"Awesome place, and in my hood! Yay for more eateries... I love you, Junction triangle.  The decor is tasteful and eclectic, classic Drake style. There's a photobooth in the entrance way, and tables full of canned items (larder) for purchase.   My breakfast muffin was outta-this-world delicious. So simple, so tasty. That chili paste is what dreams are made of. (Luckily they also sell it in the shop...) My friend also loved her blueberry muffin and our iced Americanos were perfectly made and highly caffeinated.   Not a ton of parking. All the Drake reserved spots were full when we arrived and I was hesitant to park in any others. Sweet little patio outside too, although it feels a little like you're sitting in a parking lot, which you are."}
{"text":"What a find! A busy, buzzy, beautifully styled restaurant. We went for brunch and, apart from how fantastic every dish was, it was also exceptionally great value. A real destination. BUT we made the mistake of eating at the drake cafe on queen street and were so disappointed. The location is more convenient but the two experiences were like night and day. My poached eggs were served in a wet skillet. Basically an egg bath. The potato hash wasn't a hash - just roasted new potatoes. The avocado toast was totally bizarre. Jalapeños and dried out segments of satsuma. What on earth? Do not go. Just don't go. I'm still confused how the two are part of the same group. The Commissary stands head and shoulders above the cafe. So much so that after stuffing ourselves we visited the lader and bought treats for the afternoon. The chocolate brownie cookie and lemon mirangue pie are the stuff of dreams."}
{"text":"It was a pleasurable experience to open the door of the old factory building and be hit by a blast of cold air on such a sweltering day.  The pleasure did not stop there. Excellent brunch of fantastic bread basket, brisket hash, hummus, tomato eggplant spread, and special butter. Clearly a happening place. Nicely appointed with cool art. Really good service. Thank you Allyssa.  The hummus could have used more lemon and garlic. The waitress forgot to bring one of our dishes. No big deal. It will be an opp. to go back.  Henderson craft beer , the red on tap , was an added bonus"}
{"text":"The shakshuka was delicious, the brisket sandwich, the quiche and the granola are also all delicious. We came here for brunch on a Sunday. We waited a very long time for our food, but the great service and atmosphere made up for the wait. We would come back again!"}
{"text":"Their cocktails were great, but food was just decent especially for the price. Service was also lacking. Our server disappeared for a period of time and we had to wave to get attention, water was not refilled Etc. It was especially a disappointing since it took us an hour to get to the restaurant, we definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner so thought I would stop by for lunch. This place is new so its good to give them some slack. Servers and greeters were great.   This place is extremely expensive, that was the first obvious thing to notice. Just a sandwich runs from $12-$15 + . Pasta, around $20. It was really unclear that you had to take a number to be served for take out. We came before several people but they got served first because we didn't have a number but were clearly there first.   When paying at the machine asks for a tip, the lowest % being 15% up to a 30% tip. I think tipping that % is a little bit high, especially since its just a take out order. I mean all they did was out three things in a bag. Also have an option for no tip, which should be a given.   Atmosphere was very nice, you would never have thought that from the outside of the building. Everyone in the neighbourhood was really excited to see a bakery opened up, but the pricing is just too much. Still a little unorganized and unclear where to go.   I would deff come back for a coffee and desert, but no more then that. I did buy the Duck Pate when I was leaving. It was really really gross and I threw it out soon after trying it. I also got a sandwich and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Expensive carbs.  Drake Commissary is an overpriced Panera with IG-worthy, vintage décor.  To give you an idea, a baguette (~$5), eggplant dip ($7), coffee ($4), & a loaf slice was close to $30!  Straight up drip coffee, not a latté, mocha, frappé anything foamy/creamy.  More spendy than Whole Foods, for sure!  Came here during a weekday during the day and there was ZERO parking spots.  The lot is shared and spots are marked according to what business that you're visiting.  Despite this, there weren't any spots, so you may hafta park on Sterling...if you find any spots there.  Offerings were baked goods (think:  croissants, muffins, loaf, cinnamon rolls, buns, etc.), square slices of pizza ($6), dips, open faced sandwiches (small side), coffee bar drinks, & I think there was $20 tuna nicoise salad.  So majority of items were carbs.  Not impressed for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is DOPE. The white sangria was off the chain and the pitcher is reasonably priced. All the food was amazing. We shared the brisket, fish platter, pasta and cauliflower and everything AMAZING."}
{"text":"First off, the decor is absolutely gorgeous, whoever they hired to do the design really knocked it out of the park. The swanky Mad Men style furniture, turntables and floor to ceiling marble bathrooms are stunning. The retro photo booth is a nice touch as well.  The margherita pizza was fresh and tasty but the miso cauliflower was the star of the show, amazing flavor. You will not regret ordering this trust me!  I wasn't thrilled with our server however, we had to flag her down after waiting for over 20 minutes to get menus and water. Willing to let it slide as they are fairly recently opened, but would be annoying if it happens again on my next visit. It's also quite loud. Overall, a lovely addition to the area."}
{"text":"I was excited about a Drake location opening in my neighbourhood, but this place is all style and no substance. The interior is attractive, but that's the only compliment they'll get from me. The food is so-so and overpriced.   My biggest issue: the staff will fawn all over you, but are actually ineffective and disorganized.   I took my mother-in-law and partner there for dinner, and the place was fairly full. There wasn't seating on the patio, and the hostess asked if we minded seating at a \"high table,\" which we didn't. She lead us to bar seating, which we declined because we couldn't look at each other (bar seating doesn't work for more than two people, imo). We waited for another table and she lead us to a low, low table (more like a coffee table) with low-slung seating. It's hard to describe, but it would have been very difficult to eat dinner at. We were laughing at this point, and when our server showed up we explained that we'd like to just order drinks and appetizers, and be put on a wait list for patio seating. He said that it was no problem, took our drink order (not appetizer order) and then we never. saw him. again. Someone else delivered our drinks and no one checked on us or took our appetizer order, even after our drinks had been empty for 5 minutes. We asked other servers to try to track him down, but nothing.   We got up, paid at the front, and ordered some pizza to go. That took about 20 minutes, even though the pizza is pre-made.   When we left the patio was almost empty!  The whole thing was a 2-hour and $70 ordeal and the pizza was more like bland cheese on bread."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and menu theme is confusing. The lamb ribs looked interesting but were a mess! The seasoning is a thick layer of goop on top and there's way too much fat and membrane! Lamb shouldn't be served as a rack of ribs (pork or beef, yes - lamb, no!). Only redeeming quality was the server who was extremely apologetic for the bad food experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here for late lunch with a friend and just want to start off by saying it was difficult to find parking. They only have a few spots reserved for customers so we ended up parking two blocks away.   I ordered a chicken sandwich and didn't really enjoy it, the chicken was kind of dry however my friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and liked it. I don't think I would come back because it's out of the way for me however I would recommend it to someone who wants to sit with a beverage and pastry because the place itself is very cute."}
{"text":"Eaten there twice now. Love it!  Great food. Great local beers (supporting several microbrewerys). Good service. Great vibe. After you eat you can get some great things  to go. Can't wait to try their patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Perfect dinner last night!   Yes, it is a tad pricey but nothing out of the ordinary for Downtown Toronto. Not to mention pretty much EVERYTHING, from the salami to the desserts are made from scratch on site using local ingredients. You can 100% taste the difference.  We ordered the charcuterie plate, the watermelon and blackberry salad, the jerk chicken and the miso cauliflower. Everything was fresh and delicious. Portions were filling but not huge. We got the lemon tart for dessert and it was to die for! :) Our waitress, Oliva made awesome recommendations and was very attentive.   Improvements: - There was only ONE washroom. Like one stall for women, one for men and one for families. For a venue that could potentially hold 100+ people they definitely need more bathrooms. - Although it is sharing style, the menu is a bit confusing. It's hard to put a meal together, especially if you don't go out for dinner often.  All in all, a great place for dinner. The atmosphere was perfect, kind of cool, hip and laid back - exactly what you expect from the Drake. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I was served raw chicken today. For an establishment like the Drake this is inexcusable. To make it even worse, it was takeout and I had to come back. What baffles me is that the prep people had to cut into a piece and create slices to create my portion. How they didn't notice that it was slimy, rubbery and red, I don't know. Maybe they did and because it was busy they didn't care. The person at the counter was fine when I came back but when she brought my situation to the attention of one of the prep people, he hardly flinched. I would have appreciated an apology since I was standing right in front of him, but no. They did replace my raw chicken with cooked and offered me a pastry, which I declined. I expect better."}
{"text":"This was on my list to try since it was announced this year... what's not to love about the idea of a place that has a bakery, bar, espresso, slow cooked foods, and a cool atmosphere to enjoy it in.  I will say that the place visually is what you hope all new chill local spots would be like.  Clean industrial modern aesthetics that comfortably sits groups and couples either in sofa lounges, table tops in the dim chill dining area, or by the bar.  The food... is the key missing piece for me.  In a industrial commercial area just east of Junction, you'll find the new Drake Commissary tucked in.  You'll never know this cool spot is here unless you were actively looking for it.  The space is really well done... you instantly feel a great vibe as you walk in.  The hostess is a bit absent minded and passive but she eventually gets the job done.  We were seated comfortably at the bar since the dining area was full and we were only here for espresso and desserts.  The bartender was friendly but super busy as it seem he was the only one doing all the drinks and it was very full for a random Thursday night.  We ordered 2 espresso drinks and 2 desserts coming up to a $40 with tax and tip.  Pricey for just ok.  Tiramisu - It looks pretty with its neat stacks layered as if its an entrement.  I would unfortunately say that is very very dry.  Like sawdust dry.  Equally distracting from its clean lines is the flavour.  It lacks in it.  Campo was much better and that one was just decent.  2/5  Blueberry Frangipane - Heavy and dense... you need a fork and knife to cut into this.  Frangipane usually is a fragrant nutty almond cream mixed with butter and sugar. That sounds lovely... this cake was not.  It felt over cooked ... it was light on almond as well.  The blueberry jam like topping helped it a little. 3/5  Maple Almond Latte - Our first draw was the espresso drinks with its interesting mix of nutty milks.  This one was very very sweet.  I have to admit i love maple but this seemed to be taking maple flavour to the next level. I did appreciate how this wasn't a tiny cup.  3/5  Hazelnut Chocolate Latte - This drink was richer in coffee flavour and had a minor touch of chocolate.  Unlike the almond, it was a better balance of sweetness.  Though it was $6 (more expensive than others in the neighbourhood like Tempered Room), it was a generous cup at least. 3.5/5  Overall, its a great vibe but the quality of the espresso drinks and desserts didn't do it.  We were planning to go to dinner here but with the lacklustre flavour and execution, I think we'll try another place elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood - met up with friends this afternoon for drinks and some charcuterie and cheese boards. We hung out on the couch area and it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Boards were lovely - the real star was the duck liver pate with pickled grapes. Amazing, buttery on their really yummy still warm bread. I will be back for more of that duck pate."}
{"text":"Drake Commissary was on my to do list and now on my do not repeat list. The food was great but the experience meh. I can make great food so when I go out for it I at least expect great food AND a pleasant service / full experience. So what ever was bothering the staff that day they were not being professional enough to hide it. Upon arrival we felt unwelcomed, we were then sat right beside the serving station although there were 10 open tables. We decided to start with just appetizers (duck spread, sour dough bread, olives )and a drink to give it a chance. Although our waitress was more pleasant then the placing staff we didn't feel the atmosphere was worth staying. Appetizers and 2 drinks 45$ Note:duck spread was fantastic and the sourdough bread fresh warm and tasty."}
{"text":"At first glance, I was pretty hyped to come to the Drake Commissary. Everything looked promising, from the menu to the decor. After hearing I would be coming here for a function on a weeknight, it felt like I was meant to try this out.  Upon arriving, the exterior of the restaurant really shows they've really tried to work themselves into the neighbourhood aesthetic - it looks like it belongs in this area. The decor inside gives me a modern take on vintage (does that even make sense?).  The Squash salad is something I haven't tried anywhere else. It had a nice tang without completely ruining the dish. I could've done without the skin, but all in the name of presentation, am I right? :)  The brisket was pretty good - good enough that I ate the entire thing forgetting to grab a shot of it on the plate. All I remember was it was really tender, but the mustard they added was a bit off-putting. Bitter... unpleasant.  The service was mediocre. Food came out extremely slow, and the servers were pretty inconsiderate to a good bunch of the crowd. I didn't experience this personally, but it was audible enough that I felt somewhat uncomfortable.  Fortunately, I didn't have to pay for any of it. I don't think I could've justified spending a lot for what I had that night."}
{"text":"This place was always on my brunch list and I finally tried it. The atmosphere is great, but it did feel like we were sitting too close to our neighbours and that was not comfortable for either tables.  The brunch menu is quite limited. It seems like pastry is their specialty and there was lots of sweet options, which unfortunately I'm not a big fan of. It was an overall okay experience."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Toronto.  We came here to celebrate a wedding reception, our meal And drinks started out nicely and then went down hill fast. We ordered about 7 dishes and only 5 showed up we asked twice for the other two dishes and were passed off to different servers in the end we never received the dishes and the 2 items we ordered were still on our bill and we had to have a manager come over when we explained we never received them.  This experience dealing with the manager was the most belittled I've felt in my entire life and after 5 minutes he finally agreed to take them off our bill.   This was just one example of how bad the service was tonight. Another example was someone in our party ordered a gin a tonic and asked the server for a new one since the tonic was clearly flat as it was from an open can  and our server instead of bringing a new one said she assures us \"without tasting\" that the tonic is not flat. Again we had to have the manager come over instead of just bringing us a fresh drink it turned into another stressful ordeal.  In the end we spent over $600 and were treated like second class citizens needless to say we will never be coming back and spreading the word of how awful this establishment is."}
{"text":"What to try?  I personally loved the roasted mushroom and espresso pasta here! AMAZING. Their menu reads - pasta is mixed and rolled in house with fresh ingredients. I was sold! I also liked their cold platter board too. We had the smoked, cured and potted fish platter and I really liked the dill and sour apple pickled herring. Really unique combination and it wasn't too sour and it had a nice sweet kick to it. I wasn't that big of a fan of their pizzas though. They are shareable too but it's really hard to cut through it and the pizza didn't look that appealing when it came to the table. We had the truffled bianca and I couldn't really taste the truffle in the pizza but I thought it was pretty cool to have potatoes  on the pizza. It's not someone's go to when it comes to pizzas but it's still worth a try! When it came to the drinks, I had the Ginger Rogers. If you're a fan of whiskey but want a sweet taste to your cocktails, this is definitely the one you want to try. Had hints of strawberry in there with the strawberry rhubarb addition and the honey helped with the bitter taste of whiskey. I'll go back to try the other ones since there's quite a few concoctions you can try.  When it came to dessert time, we ordered the banana cream pie and the rhubarb and strawberry frangipane. I loved their desserts! The banana cream pie was really creamy and I liked the vanilla pastry cream on top. It didn't feel heavy, it felt light! But the crust was hard though. That's the only downside to the pie. If they had warmed the pie crust up before serving the cream and toppings, I think it would be a killer dessert. I  liked the frangipane because of the cookie crust. It wasn't too sweet which I really liked and I felt like I could eat the strawberry rhubarb with every bite. Gotta try it out!  Last tip?  They opened for dinner for two weeks now and it's still a pretty new restaurant in town where they are (junction triangle) so go before the en mass goes and check it out yourself. They're open for breakfast lunch and dinner and they also have an open patio too. Located next to breweries too, you can try the breweries out if you fancy it. I have to say, the area is pretty industrial so don't expect anything fancy around the building the commissary is in. By the way, if you drive like me, there's not a lot of parking spots for drake guests in the parking lot unforunately, so you'll have to opt to park on the street which isn't too bad when you don't have to pay!"}
{"text":"I have achieved ultimate hipster status. That is all. First review on yelp?!?   They have food to sit in and food to go and it is all the same. All on display. Excellent smiling, professional, attentive service. Cool chill mod decor.   Their larder section of cured meats and pates for your next charcuterie jam! Well, welcome to the hood!   I also saw them bring out 2 high chairs so they've got you covered any way you come at them."}
{"text":"Food is mostly fine, albeit over priced.  The brisket sandwich is good.  Once I ordered avocado toast with no cilantro, but when it came, there was a big handful of cilantro mixed into the mashed avocado.  If you have that gene, like I do, it was simply inedible.  Luckily my boyfriend took it off my hands and said it was alright.  The service is friendly, but so so slow.  Been here 3 times and it's consistently mediocre."}
{"text":"So we went there for the Oscar's Party which also happened to be our anniversary night. Upon entering we were received by a warm smile. We chose a table of our liking. The ambience was very cool. Our server, Lina, was great through out the night. Courteous and attentive. Now comes the food- For the apps, we ordered a tomato confit. As nice as it sounds, it wasn't the best. Thus we ordered the hummus. It was topped with quite a lot of sesame seeds. The hummus itself seemed a bit dry. Perhaps a smoother texture would have made it better. The kale Caesar salad was excellent. We loved it. The Arctic char was great. As for the lamb, it was cooked to perfection. It was so tender that I didn't even need a knife. Beautiful! But it had quite a bit of a smell to it. Perhaps some ingredient to minimize that odor of the lamb would've made the entree more enjoyable.  They gave us complementary dessert, which was very sweet. And of course the caramel pop corn to go, one can't go wrong with that. As for the drinks, they Maharaja was excellent. What a refreshing drink. I guess the ginger in it did the trick.  Although they pour on the other drinks were so tiny that it seemed silly. Even a double was something like a one big gulp. I just didn't feel like it was worth the money.  Overall it was a good experience. If I go there again, I would try different menu items. And for the drinks, don't count on that bartender."}
