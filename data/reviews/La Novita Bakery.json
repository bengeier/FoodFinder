{"text":"Decided to finally stop in at this place on the way home from work.  I'm glad I did.  Deli counter  is adequate full of the usual meats, and cheeses.  Pricing seems to be inline with grocery stores which was good considering I figured the price would be higher in a smaller establishment.  Let's talk bread and baked goods.  Plenty to go around ranging from freshly baked buns to multigrain breads to numerous deserts.  Nothing is lacking here.  There is a vast selection to please anyone and everyone.  Prices are reasonable on the baked goods.  Small coffee counter and tables.  I will go back and perhaps try some of that freshly baked bread!    Negative would be parking.  The bakery is in a strip mall that can get busy.    Lots of helpful staff!!"}
{"text":"I used to like coming to this place for their pastries but they lost me as a customer after the worst customer service on a custom order cake that cost $65.  Basically, it was my nephew's baptism and my sister in law asked me to pick up the cake on her behalf because she was busy with other things. Once my sis-in-law saw the cake, she said it wasn't what she ordered. She showed me a picture from the company's website and sure enough it was missing piping and a large edible cross on top as the main design. The cake we received was so bare on top. It had some small printed writing and a couple of flowers in the corner. She called the company to let them know. The sales associate who handed me the cake when I went to pick it up said that it was my fault for not checking. How am I supposed to know that the job would be half done!?!? Keep in mind, the receipt clearly states the cake/design that was ordered.  Anyways, my brother and I go to the store and the same associate gives us a flimsy little silver cross to stick on the cake and refuses to do the piping. We show her the receipt and picture of what we ordered and she still refuses. So, we ask for a refund and she refuses that too. At this point, we are completely livid, so we ask for a manager. She says that there's no Manager. Of course, we are raising our tone at this point and guess who walks out? The manager didn't even recognize the design. We had to prove the picture was off their website. You can see the look on his face when he compared the two cakes. Reluctantly, he finally gave us the money after a little bit more yelling. Clearly this place doesn't care about their customers."}
{"text":"Nice little bakery with a deli counter.  In addition to all sorts of Italian breads, they do a lot of pastries and tarts, and the place smells heavenly.  They have a deli counter with great sandwiches, and a cafe counter with a few old gents sitting there speaking Portuguese and drinking espresso with 5 sugars in it!  Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and good breads and coffee (haven't bought any deli meats here, but looks good too)."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. The name is Italian due to the original owners but it is now Portuguese owned. Bread is still great. Most of their cakes are made by LaRocca. Calabrese bread, cornbread, ciabatta buns, sweetbread with coconut are all proper. Definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this bakery when we were looking to take a dessert to a dinner party. Great selection of pastries and breads. The extremely large marble cake was a hit at the party. We also bought a pizza bread thing which was delicious (would have been even better if heated up). A little pricey for some of the pastries but bread and cake prices are good. Great find!"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my house so I am a regular at this Portuguese bakery.  They have a GREAT selection of daily baked goods. Let's not forget the deli counter and a place to sit-down and have a nice cappuccino or sandwich.   The  one thing you will hate about this place is the shared parking with the rest of the strip-mall.   I strongly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I love this bakery.  Years ago i lived just across the street from it and would often wake up to the smell of something fresh baking and i would float on the wonderful aroma like in the cartoons and find myself across the street buying bread that was still warm for breakfast on a saturday morning.  I was passing by this place last night and had to stop in and get some fresh buns and some bread.  Also the cakes, oh are they ever good.  Every time we had an office function my coworkers would ask if i would stop in and grab one from here.  After all these years i am still a huge fan of this place.  Even the deli counter is full of fresh and wonderful cold cuts and the price is right too.  Even though i dont live across the street anymore, I'm going to have to make a point of dropping by more often."}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times in the past three years.  I haven't reviewed them because I felt like I had to give them a few more tries.  I think I've had a bun, a Portuguese tart and an apple danish on my latest visit.  This place looks like your typical European deli/cafe with a few tables, except they have 3 or 4 large booths that can fit 4-5 people at the back.    In terms of selection, they have lots of fresh breads and desserts. I would say they probably have more than Nova.    With regards to the apple danish I had - I really liked the flavours, but I found the pastry itself to be a bit soft and not flakey enough for my liking.    Verdict: It's a good quick bite before or after your commute from the Cooksville GO."}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other day and found this nice little bakery with fresh bread and desserts.  The caramel cheesecake was amazing, my girlfriend had the chocolate cream puff (it had a fancy name but don't remember it) and woke up the next day telling me how good it was and she wishes she bought another.  Lots of deli meat options, not the cheapest but they had a great deal on Black Forest Ham for $1.09/100 grams .  Can't wait to try some of their sandwiches and other desserts, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I walked in while I was taking the bus & grabbed a cannoli. It was tasty. It has the standard array of Italian bakery items (loaves, rolls, sweets), and you'd be good to pick up a loaf or order a cake from them if you need one."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood bakery has been here for years.  Though the name indicates an Italian bakery... It's really more Portuguese. I would say its a 3.5 star place... Definitely a notch above other Mississauga bakeries with some highlights but not quite 4 star material that make me dream of the baked goods.  When I arrived after the lunch hour, this place had at least 9 people just grabbing breads.  There are tons of bread here... Everything from your typical white bread to the crusty Italian loaves to rustic hearth multigrain bread.  The focus is definitely breads and deli meats with a few sweet offerings.  Breads are baked in house daily and the prices are great.  $0.25 for a fresh bun... deal!  Or $1.75 for a huge crusty fresh Italian loaf!    There is a whole deli section and for a moderate sized place, it has quite the extensive selection.  You can make your own amazing sandwich.  Prosciutto, salami, smoked turkey, pancetta, mortadella.. You name it, it's here.  I had a filling lunch so I just grabbed a sweet snack consisting of a Portuguese custard tart and a Silician cannoli.  I was told both were made that day.  They were very reasonably priced at $1.10 each.  The Portuguese tart had a nice deep brown crust that resulted in crispy flakey layers.  Biting into it created little shards of pastry everywhere.  It was definitely fresh but unfortunately it was light on flavour.  I suspect it was made with shortening only.  The centre was a perfect smooth custard that held its shape and had a few smattering of burnt sugar crust.  Perfectly baked and I appreciate the restraint on the sugar.  It wasn't candy like but it was a bit light on the egg flavour.  So it's a good custard tart but not great.  The cannoli was filled with a creamy ricotta and once again, good restraint on the sugar to let the flavour come through but the shell was just starting to get a bit soggy.  So it had a bit of crunch but seeing this was filled earlier in the day, it was starting to get soft.  Overall, the service was pleasant and attentive.  They welcomed you, proactively asked if you needed help, and smiled... This put them above other bakeries where attitudes of grumpy ladies were given to you in addition to your change.  It's not a destination place but if this is your hood... It's a solid bakery to go to and enjoy."}
{"text":"Recently renovated, I didn't recognize the place when I walked in.   I've been coming to this bakery for a few years since it's in my neighbourhood.  It's your fairly regular European bakery - breads, pastries, deli meats & cheese. Prices are average, what you will see at most places.  The pastries are delicious and buns are always fresh.  Since the renos though, they seem to have cut back on shelving a lot of products. The place looks better aesthetically, but your options are more limited with food items now.  I think they are trying to make it more into a cafe"}
{"text":"Found a place to cool down after work. I tried the ham and cheese sandwich with regular black coffee. It's ok. I also tried the pecan pie. It's ok too. There are different kinds of pastries too. There are different kinds of cheese and sausages.  The bread loaves are fresh and is sliced only after you but it. I came around 4:30 and the place was quite. By 5:30, people started coming in and the bread slicer can be loud and annoying.  Ambiance is simple classic coffee w/ pastry shop style. They have TV showing the news.  Staff looks like students but they were very helpful, fast and efficient.  Parking is in front of the bake shop."}
