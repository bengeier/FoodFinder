{"text":"This place stinks... I'm definitely not going to be coming to this place again.. They tried to rip me off for no reason.. I'm not happy"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer and hang out with friends.  The bartenders are friendly and helpful.  The food is okay.  We went recently and ordered the pizza.  Toppings were great but the crust tasted like toasted cardboard.  Absolutely no flavor.  Same with the fried zucchini.  It tasted like someone had deep fried styrofoam.  NO flavor whatsoever.  Use some salt and pepper folks. Great draft list."}
{"text":"Three stars is pretty good for me. I highly recommend this place. Best buffalo chicken wrap in PGH so far (been a lot of places but I haven't tried everywhere obviously)  chicken pesto is fantastic. And hands down best ranch in PGH. For two out of three of those reasons I keep going back.  I occasionally drink there but not often because their food is fairly priced however their drinks are closer to the overpriced side."}
{"text":"Your choices are few if you live in the Squirrel Hill area and don't want to be a designated driver, but fortunately Silky's is here.  Pitchers are not too cheap, but they have an excellent selection and plenty of table space upstairs. Got lots of TVs for sports-watching, colorful locals, and cheesy rock music. Can't do much better than that.  I hear they have good burgers, too, but I've yet to try it as the kitchen closes at 11."}
{"text":"Beers and shuffle board, what more could you ask for ?!?!?! The prices on beers are good Monday through Wednesday when they have awesome specials, but can be slightly more pricey otherwise.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to watch out-of-market NFL games on a  Sunday,  but sadly,  just found out today they no longer have NFL Sunday Ticket.     Food quality here  usually a cut above typical pub fare... Service can be spotty when it gets busy...  Good selection of beer."}
{"text":"Call me crazy - but this is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. After quickly growing tired of the South Side bar scene post-college, and dealing with packed Shadyside bars, Silky's always hits the spot.  It is very unpretentious, and even a little unglamorous, but that's what makes it one of the better bars in the area. Their food is always surprisingly good and modestly-priced, and the draft list is constantly changing.   Although they are listed as a sports bar, it isn't anything crazy like a Buffalo Wild Wings, and definitely won't make non-sports fanatics feel excluded. They are accommodating enough though to put any game on that you request.  The reason I did not give 5 stars is because the ownership & staff often get fussy with anyone who sits at a table and doesn't order from the wait staff (who are often preoccupied or understaffed).   Overall a great go-to bar, and the perfect fit for Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I had a blast a couple of months ago when I was here. The music, atmosphere, everything was perfect for the night out I was looking for. The food is also really good. It satisfied my late night cravings. We sat in the upper floor area and was able to look down to the bar and lower level. Everyone seemed to be having a great time around us which rubbed off on us and made our evening a blast. I've been itching to go back ever since. I really enjoyed being there."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere sports dive bar. That said, there was a balled up paper towel in my soup and the apple on my entree was clearly moldy along with the  apple seeds mixed in the dish... Pitchers of beer were reasonable; come here for beer -- not for food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get wasted while watching sports. I have spent a full 8 hours drinking at Silky's one day. That was a lot of fun. I recomend you try it sometime. You will get a good mix of people. Some Tepper studnts, some locals, some drunk underage kids who think you want to fight them. All in all, a good time."}
{"text":"A tad pricier than the environment suggests... All in all though if you like sports bar atmosphere but with Pittsburgh flavor that isn't too over bearing this place is great.... The Chelsea's are too cute btw"}
{"text":"Quite surprised when we found this bar on Saturday . Nice local bar in Squirrel Hill. Bartender was fun! However when our tab was served up, really surprised ! Drinks and a burger and fries $61 before tip!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to download, join, and write a \"yelp\" after my experience the other evening. When you think of pub food I believe most of us expect greasy burgers and wings, at least something to soak up the excessive  beer. I walked into Silky's (having been there before and leaving under impressed) with that mind set but instead was blown away by the menu.   It contained your standard burger this, nachos, salads, etc. It was also paired with the Chef's daily creations which were mostly heavier dishes. My friend and I settled on New England  Clam Chowder and coconut shrimp as an appetizer followed up by the crab cake sandwich to split. The soup was okay, very filling, creamy, just enough veggies and seafood. What really hit home was the shrimp- five jumbo, succulent shrimp paired with a chutney sauce and strawberries. It was one of the costlier items on the menu and worth every scent. The sandwich was also fabulous,  I dressed it up with some sauce but the patty  was so well prepared it could stand alone in flavor.   To top off a wonderful meal, our bartender Chris was lovely! Plus- Wednesday after 9 they offer $2.75 drafts and bottles (Magic Hat Electric Feel paired nice with the seafood,  kudos to Chris )!  For a typical bar with your  run of the mill atmosphere the dining experience and food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great rotation of draft beers and more than just your average bar food. The perfect place to watch a sporting event. Friendly and hard working bar tenders and staffs."}
{"text":"Average sports bar in a neighborhood that deserves better.  Average food with above average prices.  The service is always terrible here.  I have left on several occasions without recieving my food due to the poor/slow service.  Murray ave grill is a much better place to eat."}
{"text":"Upstairs seating was comfortable.  The draft beer selection was nice and big as were the portions of the food."}
{"text":"Silky's is my roommate's favorite bar. One of her friends is almost sure to be found at Silky's every day, too. I think this is a great neighborhood bar that also serves excellent food.   The place looks like a typical bar. Dark wood, TVs playing sports, a large beer selection... But the great thing is you can come here for dinner too, and be happy with the food. If you like burgers, I recommend the Silky's Burger. It comes with two kinds of cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and raw onions--pretty classic, but well done. The quesadillas are also good. I like that they have a specials menu, as well. I tried the BBQ burger the other day and it was scrumptious. Huge burgers with waffle fries that I can barely finish if I have a drink.   For people who aren't into beer, they do have two ciders on the menu (Woodchuck and Angry Orchard), as well as some liquor options. Other good things to know are that it is decent for groups. There's a table upstairs that we usually have 8 or 9 people at."}
{"text":"I usually judge bars this way: If I can get a real black and tan (Harps and Guinness, of course) it's a good bar. If it costs less than 5, it's a great bar. Happy hour is from 4 - 6 and every pint I got was $4.09 (this may vary depending on the beer of course).  They have a great selection of beers on tap (for those who also think it's important: Magic Hat #9, Blue Moon, Newcastle, and Penn Pilsner Oktoberfest to name a few), and a surprisingly large menu. I had the prosciutto, tomato, and mozzarella salad - it was pretty decent, especially for a little Pittsburgh sports bar. They have a couple nice flat screen TVs for games (that I'm sure you can see from the loft-like second floor seating area), a plus for sports fans. And for non-sports fans it's fairly quite mid-day, you can enjoy their nice selection of music AND talk to your friends. Silky's is great for a pint or a dinner before you catch a movie at the cinematic manor next door."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.  I'm not much into sports bars, but Silky's is a good place to stop at before or after a movie.  And my mom and I did just that, stopping in for a quick dinner before going to see \"The Artist\" at the nearby Manor.    Mom ordered the Fandango Chicken Salad.  Kind of a shame that the nearby Manor isn't on Fandango.com but that's another story.  Me, I went for the Cuban Chicken Sandwich-- chicken breast, ham, pickles, mustard and swiss cheese on foccacia bread!  Pretty good!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this low class trash bar! I got banned from this stupid bar for a stupid reason and it was just because I wasn't drinking and was loitering. The irony was I was waiting for a friend and wasn't ready to order yet. Also because I went by myself to drink and flirting with women, I was banned because of that. It was beyond ridiculous!! The staff there are nothing but scum and I wish this stupid Sikly's bar will go out of business! Unless you like cursing, sports, and drunk/bar tender assholes, drunken assholes in general getting away with so much when they aren't banned either, avoid this miserable place!! Not for the proper."}
{"text":"Great time.  Not sure why.  Perhaps it's the people, and being pretty nicely drunk, but just had a great time.  Nice brews on top, such as East End Fat Gary Nut Brown, cool shuffleboard game that led to some great laughs and frustrating cries, and the old internet jukebox that keeps the tunes rolling (although this night there was a bit too much DMB for my tastes!).  The owner heard we were from NY so he got to talking to us he was from there as well.  And he was visibly pretty hammered himself!  Which makes me think there is a good reason for owning a bar, steady access to the free drink.  Good move Chris!  Wrap up;  Despite such a sparse crowd, this place still had a cool feel, and we will definitely be going back, on our many return trips to the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been here a couple times and really enjoyed ourselves. Tonight we decided to order some wings and a salad to go. The guy on the other end of the phone was nice and polite on the phone told me it would be 20 minutes, ok no problem, i called my boyfriend and told him. He decided to go and pay for it and maybe have a beer until it was ready.  Whoever he had talked to when he got there was so incredibly rude to him, huffing and puffing and rudely stating he had \"just gotten the call\" whatever dude! all he wanted to do was pay for the damn thing! I work as a kitchen manager, ive served tables and have bartended for years i totally understand when things get frustrating but i have never, ever been rude or annoyed that somebody just wanted to simply pay for their to go order and wait for it. RIDICULOUS. And he can hear the kitchen staff cursing and yelling... really nice. I have never ever once thought about writing a stupid review of a restaurant until now. I can't even believe that people would treat a customer like that for just wanting to pay. After that he left, didn't come back for the food ( Because why bother ) and we went somewhere else, and will probably never come back. Over something so absurd."}
{"text":"My fave local bar, ever.  Awesome bartenders and staff, with decent food and ice cold beer.  \"Fist pump\" for Long Island Iced Tea night.    I dig the local sporty vibe to the place. It is also deceivingly spacious: two-levels (upstairs is for eating) and the ceilings are high... the whole place is open, and feels like a cozy cabin.  it's never too crowded or too loud, but gets a nice draw of people.  Great place to watch a game, throw some darts, play some shuffleboard."}
{"text":"I worked up a serious craving for waffle fries ($4.75) last week and discovered that Silky's could fill this void.  My friend and I came in on a Saturday in the late afternoon and got beer and waffle fries while sitting at the bar. The plate of waffle fries was huge and amazing, and the beer prices were average. I would come back here for a burger, as they looked really good.  An older man took care of us and provided fine bar service.  He was the only person for the whole bar, and it seems that you need to walk up to the bar to place any order.  There were also a limited number of seats where you can see a game.  This doesn't seem like a place that prides itself on service, but I would come back for bar food and a game."}
{"text":"You can't ask much these days from a sports bar that is not corporate owned. Lazy wait staff, old fashion TV sets that give you a headache, no beer selection, but Silky's still does it. Hmmmmm? I want to watch the game, eat cheap food that i don't think is being made by Gordon Ramsay, drink beer, be attended to often by staff and maybe just hang out for a pint or two without getting hassled to leave...oh, I want to walk there.   Silky's is a very common Pittsburgh sports bar, but what makes it common makes other bars suck it big. A very large menu for a sports bar, great beer and spirit choices, music that won't ruin the Pens game and fast and attentive wait staff.  The owner is unbelievably approachable and will be happy to change the channel on any TV to accommodate you (It is a Philly bar, so tread lightly). The seating is ample enough for a party of 8 or a quiet booth for you and a friend. Weekly specials change it up and almost everything I have eaten there was way above par for bar food with healthy choices like wraps and cold sandwiches.  The proximity to Forbes and Murray makes it ideal if you want to leave the South Side and Oakland crowds. Always top notch.  Only one drawback. On weekends, good luck getting a seat downstairs in the bar area.  Visit if you've never been, it won't blow your mind, but will become a staple for the same-old same-old."}
{"text":"Pros:  1) good happy hour specials 2) decent food 3) plenty of televisions above the bar for watching sporting events 4) they allow children (pro if you like and/or have kids)  Cons:  1) service is absolutely horrendous 2) TVs are all directly above the bar (so if you're at a high top that isn't facing the bar, you're SOL) 3) they allow children (con if you are a reasonable human being and do not think children should be allowed to run--nay, sprint at top speed--around a cramped, crowded bar)   Overall, Silky's isn't a bad spot, but be prepared to be really assertive with your server or bartender if you hope to get a drink or food order within a reasonable timeframe."}
{"text":"Good bar. Good bar food. Did I mention good bar food? I simply can't say no to wings and they make a good wing! Also they have waffle fries and that's always a bonus. There's beer options and the specials are good too!   Consistent each and every time I've gone. I appreciate a place that delivers consistently and again, I must say those wings are DE-Lish!  Ladies, you're not going to find the love of your life here but you certainly will have a good time!"}
{"text":"I LOVE small neighborhood places like this !   I have stopped in here with friends in the past , but really never ordered dinner. Well , it was dinner time , ( St. Patrick's Day ) And .....Ok , So I'm part Irish. I ordered the Corned Beef & Cabbage dinner special.  This dish was delicious, very well made with the right touch of potatoes and Irish-e- ness.  Well worth the trip for me. However , I'm not too sure that I will have many friends tomorrow at work , if you know what I mean ??  5 Stars Guy's !"}
{"text":"When there are signs in the window for line cook and restaurant manager it is a good indication not to order food. I found that to be true."}
{"text":"I asked for a beer and was given a draft in a plastic cup.  I try to stay away from drafts and if the beer was available in bottle and draft I think the bartender should ask which you prefer.  At any rate received the draft and thought I'd give it a go.  It's been at least ten years since I've had draft beer from a bar.  Big mistake, the one beer made me very ill.  It felt like a mild case of food poisoning.    I don't understand why these places don't care for their draft systems properly.    No food ordered, left the bar for home immediately and spent the next six hours in and out of the library.     With many options in the area, I will not return to Silky's."}
{"text":"A truly great bar for Hillers. It's patronized by locals and students and everything in between. The tender does not pull his pours. The wait staff is funny, friendly, and quick. The fare is surprisingly diverse. The pineapple shrimp salad is great. This is a quintessential sit-and-talk bar."}
{"text":"Silky's the place to go to watch a game and indulge in all the things you should not be indulging in.  Decent beers on tap, Great wings! Tremendous burgers! Golden waffle fries and my all time favorite French onion soup!.  I'm from a little ways north, closer to buffalo and we take wings seriously. I do wish that I could find a 10 cent draft and 25 cent wing special! We call it white trash Wednesdays and that deal can't be beat! So back to the wings. I like them to be extra well done and super crispy, no slimy chicken skin for me.   The burger juices run down your hands and the wet wipes should be abundant. I can't even think about those waffle fries...well seasoned mouthfuls of light airy potato puffs.  The french onion soup had me at the CHEESE! My arch nemesis in healthy eating. Spoonful after spoonful of goopy provalone slightly broiled so you get the cheese bubbling over the side. The best part!  Get a seat at the bar or a high top table, there is always the upstairs but I prefer to sit down stairs where the action is. When it's busy there's not much room to move about, and they don't have the best of specials so it can add up to be a pricey game day. Highly encourage you make it there"}
{"text":"Silky's is a stand-by if you live in squirrel hill.  it has a pretty laid back atmosphere and is usually lively even during the week, which makes it great for meeting up after work for a few beers (wednesday is import night!).  plenty of room upstairs with tables and free wifi is you want to at least pretend to get some work done.    but by far the best thing about sikly's is their mini-shuffleboard table, which is way more fun than you would ever expect if you haven't tried it before (usual rule: losing team buys the next pitcher)."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood dive bar. Nice little hangout. Don't expect a trendy nightclub. It's a bar with a juke box and a great shuffleboard table."}
{"text":"This place has solid bar food all around.  The Silky Burger is still one of the best burgers of all time.  This is exactly the type of place I miss now that I am not in Pittsburgh anymore.  Many a Sunday I wish I had a Silky's around these parts."}
{"text":"I've been to a few happy hours here, and it's a really solid place to get a drink with friends.  I can't recall all their happy hour deals - we've usually gone on Friday and I think their special on that day is pretty minor (like 50 cents off beer or something), but they have better deals on other weekdays.  We can always get a table at happy hour time.  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  Affordable food, which I haven't found to be terribly special, but it's fine as bar food goes.  We've had various appetizers (onion rings, chicken fingers, nachos) - the nachos are HUGE, as I recall - even our group of four had trouble finishing them.  I'm happy to live just down the street from Silky's, and I'd always be up for a return visit for a drink with friends, or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Solid bar food, darts and shuffle board. If they had some more big screens it would be a 4 star."}
{"text":"The tap selection is decent. They had about a dozens drafts including breweries such as Great Lakes and Fat Head's during my visit.  The atmosphere is a bit mixed. Some sections are rowdy (like near the table games) while others are tame (such as the upstairs).  One of the downsides is that the kitchen closes before 11 PM."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. There were cob webs everywhere and it didn't look like the floor had been swept in months. The restroom was out of soap (it happens, no big deal) but I told the waitress before we even ordered. No one replaced the soap the entire time we were there. How was the staff washing their hands? My husband wanted to stay so we ate. Food was good. But I'd hate to see the kitchen."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Immediately seated our party of 4 adults and 5 kids.  Great beer selection. Great bar food with some surprises thrown in.  I had a burger ... I am an admitted food snob and the burger was damn good.  DAMN GOOD I SAY! $2.75 imports on Wednesday make me wish I lived closer than 3 hours.  Tab for 9 folks, with drinks, came to $80? Yes. That is an automatic 5 stars.  Were it that I lived in/around Squirrel Hill, I'd be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Classic dive sports bar! Waffle fries were hands down the best I've ever had. Great amount of beers on tap. Came here for game day but was surprised it wasn't busier. 50 cent wings on game day (wings were just OK). Will definitely be back next time we're in Squirrel Hill!!"}
{"text":"I tried Silky's for the first time yesterday. It's one of the few places in Squirrel Hill I haven't tried, so I decided to check it out. I got the steak salad, a bowl of New England clam chowder, and a basket of waffle fries. When they asked how I wanted my steak for the salad, I said medium rare. But it turned out overcooked and dry. My clam chowder had one clam in it (I think). MAYBE two. It also tasted sour, was too watery, and was more the size of a cup than a full bowl. The only good part of the meal was my basket of waffle fries, which came in a great portion for just $5 and was delicious. I will definitely come back for another basket of waffle fries, but I'm not sure if I'd try anything else.  Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Good atmosphere, great walking distance to everything, decent parking , fries are amazing, menu has something for everyone. A bit pricey. Sometimes understaffed which causes slow service. But all and all a great place and had nothing but good times."}
{"text":"Staff are unfriendly and apparently are worried more about making tips than their actual service. This is referring more to the bald bartender than our waitress. If you pay with a card then they charge an extra 3.5% so bring cash if you can. We used to come here to watch football games and hang out with friends but not anymore. Nothing is worth their horrible treatment and rude attitude."}
{"text":"When I lived in Regent Square this was one of my places to hit with friends for a local night out. Now I'm in Bloomfield and patronize the Liberty Ave location. Squirrel Hill offers basic bar fare and a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"I've literally never been disappointed at this place, great beer selection, fantastic food, huge portions! So far I've had the surf and turf salad and the fish sandwhich. Best coleslaw I've found in Pittsburgh yet! The only issue I have is the trek from the upper floor dining room to the bathroom in the basement haha."}
{"text":"I go  to Silkys four days a week. there are a lot of fun people that work there. I get along with all of them I watch alot of sports....."}
{"text":"Traditional dive with amazing food! The Reuben and Rachel are my personal faves. Huge portions! Love to hit this spot after work. It doesn't get too crowded when I'm there and we like that we can actually have a conversation in a group."}
