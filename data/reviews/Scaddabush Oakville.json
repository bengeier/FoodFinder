{"text":"The fresh mozzarella is to die for, they make it fresh and is delicious! The service and the atmosphere is great. A perfect place to go hace a nice meal and a great time"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, pizza outstanding, meatball to die for, good selection of beer and wine, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place! The food taste wonderful and service is very warm. During lunch time, there are many people. I will definitely take my friends to come again."}
{"text":"Wow,  what a difference less people dining makes! Nice to see this place got some of their kinks worked out.  Came on a Saturday 1pm, no wait,  healthy amount of Ppl eating there but not the 45 minute waiting time I had around 5-7pm when I first went. Server was super nice, got a few apps some pasta,  and a few drinks. Everything was super tasty,  probibly the best Scada experience I've had for food quality out of the 8 times I've gone to one here and at Square one.  The mule drink was amazing,  bartender knew their stuff.   The location is great,  nice and easy to do stuff all in one place,  I ate here then saw a movie.  For sure will come back next time I want to go to Oakville for a dinner/movie night. Bravo Oakville Scada, you fixed all the issues I had from the first time.  Good mgmt,  nice to see."}
{"text":"Well I must say Scaddabush surprised me I  a good way.  I was hesitant to go here as I had heard a bad review from a true d of mine.  But my experience was excellent.  The service was extremely friendly, almost like we knew each other for years.  The food was excellent, particularly the freshly made mozzarella with deli and bread.  This was definitely the highlight and well worth the price.  This is a great spot for date night with the wife and I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight. So no long wait time which is the case on weekends ( know this from trying 3 times). Great service from our waiter Patrick & guest seating hosts, great food, family friendly. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Service was timely and friendly, even with it being a busy night the staff were very attentive . Food was great, we shared the balsamic mozzarella made in house, very tasty and both our entrees were very good. Atmosphere was great, busy place with a classy Italian touch. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was friendly, nothing to complain about except the water bottle my family and I were given. The second one we received was much cleaner. Not sure if this is part of the industrial aesthetic the restaurant gives but It didn't look too safe to drink from. There was a table in front of ours who seem to be there for a child's birthday and from afar I could see the two water bottles on their table looked just as gross. Wish I could've taken a picture without it being creepy since it was a table of 8 (7-9 year old) girls with two chaperones."}
{"text":"I come here roughly once a week when I'm in town.  The food is better here than the previously named restaurant.  However, the re-brand has lost some of its shine since the launch.  This place was packed after the reopening.  That is not so now.    Tonight, I had the chicken and shrimp pasta for the third time.  The first time, it was amazing.  The second time it was good.  Tonight, it was good, but the portion of chicken has shrunk progressively the last two times.  The shrimp hasn't.  Isn't shrimp more expensive?  Maybe the owners are throttling back on the food?  You decide."}
{"text":"The waiter explained that the pasta, mozzarella, and breads are made fresh every morning.  The cheese & bread, and appetizers were quite good. But I ordered the pesto linguine and it was average at best.  Friendly and kind staff. Busy atmosphere, but I enjoyed it. Although, the main course was just mediocre. But I'm definitely willing to come again and try a different dish!"}
{"text":"Franchise....hit or miss. Sat in the bar area by choice. Waitress behind the bar was good. Appetizer was yummy mozzarella. Meals were poor, pasta was good but the spaghetti and meatballs was dry and required sauce...meatball was surprisingly bland. My pasta and sauce in the chicken shrimp pasta dish was good but the cook managed to over cook the chicken breast, requested a replacement breast it too was over cooked. Bottle of wine with dinner was decent. For a franchise it wasn't consistent unlike the Keg which is consistently the same every time"}
{"text":"Met my wife for a lunch break here and we each had a pasta dish.  I had a basic tomato sauce pasta and was unimpressed by their home made pasta and sauce.  Sauce was bland. Barely any salt or even some basil. Some may say it's not traditional Italian to put basil is a tomato sauce, I say bollocks to that.  Traditional is subjective, and relative to a region, but to not salt a sauce properly that's just careless. Unless you eat pasta crazy fast and don't mind the little dots of red sauce all over your face and clothes, a regular sized dish of pasta will get cold before you finish.   They did provide a complimentary dessert because of a personal celebration.  Great service."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 7:45 on a Saturday evening during a drive back home after a day trip. Scaddabush downtown Toronto was good so we thought we'd try this one. I was in the mood for a good spaghetti...only to find out after studying the menu that they ran out of spaghetti, fettucine, possibly penne too. What kind of an Italian restaurant runs out of all three?! I switched to the more expensive steak instead, which was OK but not what I had been craving.  Also, the bruschetta was drowned in balsamic. We also did not see the waitress at our table enough.  We will likely not return to this location but will give the Toronto one another shot."}
{"text":"Service: Amazing! So sweet and polite! Ambience: so beautiful... the antiques and jars were absolutely giving off a great vibe  Food: absolutely delicious and very flavourful  I got the prosciutto grilled cheese with side ceaser salad... it was sooo good!! Like great crispness of the bread and perfectly grilled cheese and prosciutto was properly cooked! Amazing food!  Great place to go with friends and family:) Thanks scaddabush:)"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 1/10 Drink: n/a Service: 3/10 Value: 2/10 Hygiene: 9/10 Aesthetics: 6/10  Came here on a Thursday for a farewell lunch. They only allowed us to order from a fixed menu (choice of pasta/hamburger/salad), since our group was so large.   I ended up ordering the hamburger. I have not been more disappointed in a burger. The patty was BURNT. Aside from it being so burnt you could only taste charcoal, the burger itself was flavorless and bland. I have never had a worse burger anywhere.  It took over an hour to get bread on the table. It took almost another hour to get our food.  If you were going to get a fixed menu, it's supposed to be fast. Instead, the food came out of the kitchen one at a time, and several burgers were burnt as well.   The decor is almost the same as the building it took over (Alice Fazoolis)  The service was poor and they tried to pass on the blame to everyone else. They did offer free meals to a couple individuals. I ended up having to pay $25 for this absolute mess of a meal.   This place is awful and just not worth coming to. I'm sure the food may be slightly better another time, but honestly this meal was disgusting and I've never had such a poor meal. I would not recommend this place at all based on this experience."}
{"text":"Great service, pizza and pasta was great. Nice environment and I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 10 people, and there were some pro's and cons to our visit.  Pros:  -we were seated promptly, despite being a Friday and not having a reservation. -we were seated at a family table, and given a sample platter of pesto pasta to try which was a nice offer  Cons:  -service was slow and it just seemed to be 1 server helping our table, especially when handing the food out and taking orders or paying, an additional server may have been helpful for a large group  -a couple of people in my party had some questions, and the answers seemed to all start with either \"I think...\" \"I'm not sure...\" etc... more knowledge might have been an asset   Food was just ok, service was fine, the overall experience was fine. No major complaints, just some fine tuning would be helpful. The restaurant is seemingly still working out some kinks, but nothing major enough to deter me from returning again."}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight. We sat in the bar area and were served water (the bottle was a tad cloudy mind you), and had our drink orders taken right away. The server was adamant that if we didn't like our beer choice of the Goose Island IPA, that he would get us something else (we really enjoyed it).  We ordered the mozzarella/prosciutto tray to start. Wow. The cheese and fig jam were delicious, the sea salt a perfect balance to the sweet jam, and the bread was fresh and warm. Would order again for sure. We ordered a fresh pressed spiced apple cinnamon to share after our first drinks and it was perfect for two of us--and very good.  Our food came promptly and the pasta was super fresh as promised. Fries were hot and crispy and I really liked the Rosemary garlic seasoning on them. Stuffed meatball sandwich was huge and so tender and flavorful. The chicken Parmesan was pretty average, but still good. I found the Alfredo sauce on my spaghetti was a tad bland. All in all though, we were both very pleased with our meals. The server was very friendly and attentive all night, and had answers to all of our questions.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was the first Italian spot I tried in Canada. I have to say, it was amazing. Everything here was above and beyond. The staff, the food, the service, the decor, all of it. Our waitress, Jasneet was honestly one of the best I've ever had. She was very efficient and entertained me and my family at the same time. It was as if she wasn't even our waitress but like a friend joining us for dinner! If you ever come here, ask for her, she is amazing. But from my observations, the other staff there is amazing too.  One of the toddlers in our party, accidentally broke a glass. One of the employees asked if we were okay and started sweeping up the mess immediately and told us that there was no need to apologize and that this happens all the time. The staff here is very understanding and empathetic.  Food was just as amazing as the service. I ordered calamari and the \"Chicken Limone\". Both were great! I personally, love lemon chicken so I was so glad to see it on the menu here. The sauce that came with the dish was so delicious and savory and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Almost wanted to order another one!  This was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had. Thank you so much Scaddabush for this lovely experience. The next time I come to Ontario, I will for sure, come visit you again! :)"}
{"text":"Whenever we eat out, I would say service from servers is a huge component to the way I feel about a restaurant. I've been to Scaddabush Oakville and Scaddabush Square one... I would say I preferred Oakville before in general but after having Leandra as a server, I'd say I DEFINITELY now prefer Oakville. Leandra was amazing... good conversation but also was not obtrusive. We never felt rushed and if felt like she actually cared. After we walked out, as we started the car, I see Leandra running out in the snow...turns out I forgot my teftovers!  Not the first time I've ever forgotten a container of leftovers, but it definitely was the first a server had run out to give it back. The fact it was snowing/ had freezing rain made it even more impressive. Hopefully Scaddabush knows what great value they have with Leandra! Oh On the ambiance side, nice and calm comparative to it's sister company Jack Astor's . Definitely try the charity bread, it's yummy and they donate a portion to charity. Oh bonus points on fresh made pasta which is supposed to be made daily like their mozzarella . Also like their white sangria... I could probably polish off a pitcher by myself?"}
{"text":"Consistency isn't their forte.  I've been to the Scaddabush near Square one and this is my second time at this location. My latest visit was short of impressive. Their water bottle seems to have seen weeks without proper cleaning; the inside of the bottle was covered with a film of hard water scum. The fresh mozzarella was left too long in ice cold water - cheese was too hard. We got charged twice for an entree and for a salad we did not order. The Italian burger bun was burned while the burger could use some seasoning. Payment process took a good 15 mins."}
{"text":"Very nice place, excellent service and delicious food. Staff went out of their way to make it a special experience. The pasta is very fresh (Penne Carbonara) and the Polenta appetizer was amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Not sure the mozzarella is worth all the fuss. Blood orange soda was tasty. Service was ok, hostess was a little meh. Chairs are uncomfortable. I probably won't go back in the near future but I won't be ruling it out entirely."}
{"text":"Good place for a Friday eve. A bit loud but good music .  Food wine and service was great."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and I really enjoy eating here. I like how this place has that rustic/modern features, with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The table setting is set with old traditional grandmother \"high tea\" ambiance. Our waitress was wasnt so friendly but at least accommodating. The quality of the food is great, we had the flat bread pizza, lobster ravioli, Bolognese pasta and the kids had pasta with Alfredo sauce. It feels authentic and modern at the same time. After the first time I had no intention on coming back. However........  I was obligated to go back the second time around due to a business lunch with my client (they made the reservation). Second time around was great, our waitress was funny, attentive, and patient. We took our time to order our appetizers, and main course. Our food came out hot and properly seasoned. Food was great as usual, taste just like the first time (which is great that they keep the quality consistent). What makes this time different is our waitress informed us with one of there already existing appetizers, the \"variety of mozzarella cheese\" appetizer options. This changes the game for me. Note: this item is ONLY offered in the dinner menu but our waitress said it was also available to order for lunch. We ordered  two kinds of mozzarella. One had prosciutto & fig jam and the other was my obsolute favourite which is spicy, it has hot peppers, cherry tomatoes in a red sauce..delicious!!! I am looking forward to going back and ordering my mozzarella appetizer again. I would have given rate this 5 stars but because of my first experience I giving this a 4."}
{"text":"I was at the Scaddabush restaurant in Mississauga and I had such a good experience- the food there was excellent and looked like from the food magazine. So that was the reason why we chose Scaddabush in Oakville. But it was such a disappointment. I give them 2 stars only because one salad dish with grilled chicken was very good and the manager was nice when he came to apologize about the mix up and offered my friend to change her dish. But other than that the dishes could not compare to the dishes in Mississauga! Tomato-Fennel soup was very oily - it had a thick layer of oil swimming on top, it was so ugly and greasy. My friend said it was also a little bit too bland. I guess the oil was from too much melted cheese, we couldn't figure out. We also ordered Zucchini Butternut Squash Ravioli because I had this dish before (in Mississauga location they came beautifully arranged with lots of hazelnut cream sauce all around) and they were so good but not here in Oakville. Looked like somebody just threw few ravioli on the plate and even forgot the best part - their delicious hazelnut sauce. We mentioned this to the waitres who did not apologize about it but was more like \"Oh, you wanted the sauce? Ok.\"  Like really?! (We did not take a photo of this bland looking sad ravioli dish.) At the end they brought back the dish with very small amount of sauce (that looked like regular cream sauce compared to other location where the sauce was a generous amount with lots of hazelnut pieces). So I asked the waitress where are the hazelnuts; we can't see even one, and she said \"They are infused inside the sauce\", so basically can't be seen- haha! The good part was that the manager came out to apologize and offered another dish because my friend did not know that this dish is spicy (on the menu it does not mention that there are chilli flakes). She got another dish \"Goat Cheese & Beet Salad\" that was also my choice - only her dish looked 100% better as it was brought from the manager. My salads dressing was mostly oil, not the balsamic vinegar, it was pretty bland. After all, I like Scaddabush restaurant but I would choose another location where they pay attention."}
{"text":"Against my better judgment we returned to Scaddabush to give it another try, big mistake. My daughters pasta came way under cooked, I would say it was raw. They replaced it but it took forever, we were all done our food by the time her new pasta arrived. She had about half and we asked to take the rest home, the waitress took the food and didn't bring back the leftovers. After dinner I ordered a coffee, how could the mess that up you would wonder? By not bringing it but yes it was on the bill.   Service is definitely not their strong suit, the food is OK if you like prepackaged rewarmed food that is made to look fresh cooked.   Don't waste your time or money, go some place else."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch this afternoon at Scaddabush.  It's been open since last April.  I'd had lunch there a few times when it was an Alice Fazooli's so I experienced a bit of déjà vu.  I ordered what I usually get at a Scaddabush ... an Americano pizza.  I love love love pizza and they make good pizzas.  Today mine was delicious ... cheesy and loaded with pepperoni.  The chef had neglected to put the Scaddabush spice on it and I was okay with that as I sometimes request it without it.  The service was just okay, though.  My server was pleasant but I felt a bit neglected.  Once my pizza was dropped off at my table, I didn't see her again until it was time to pay, even though there were only a few tables of people.  I could have used another pop but she didn't check up on me to see if I needed one.  I could hear a few of the servers chatting and laughing so I knew they were around."}
{"text":"New to the area so checked out the complex on Winston Park Drive the other night. Not sure who the A. Marie C. Is who wrote from the other day however sounds like a TROLL. This place was great! Food on point (try the Americano Pizza, so Good!), service friendly, great atmosphere. As far as college bar comment, it's probably because she was never invited to one in her \"better\" years. Check this place out, it's a great time."}

{"text":"We visited Scaddabush for the first time last night. It's located on the Mississauga/Oakville border just north of the QEW in the movie theatre plaza.  We arrived at 6:00 p.m. and were told it would be a 45 minute to 1 hour wait. They took our cell # and said they'd text. It ended being about a 50 minute wait.  We were seated in the bar area at a high top table.   The waitress approached us immediately and took our drinks order. She brought us water right away and then the bartender brought over our bar drinks. We had a 'Lower Manhattan' and a Negroni. Both were delicious.   We ordered our food and then waited for about half an hour for the food to come out. 2 of us (we were a table of 4) got our food and then about 5 minutes later 1 more dish came out. The waitress did come over a couple of times in between to assure us that the other dishes were coming. After about another 5 minutes, she said she had checked on the last dish and that it would be out soon. The manager came over about 10 minutes later and apologized and told us it was coming right out. She also told us it would be 'on the house'. The waitress came back and apologized again. The last dish came out about 5 minutes later.   All the food was delicious, so I can only think that this is typical growing pains for a newly opened restaurant and especially since it was a VERY busy Friday night (Good Friday).  My husband had a Caesar salad which was very good, plenty of dressing, right amount of garlic and lots of bacon. He also had butternut ravioli which he absolutely loved. The hazelnut buttercream sauce was creamy and so tasty and there was plenty of it.  I had the 'butcher' pizza with a gluten-free crust. There was plenty of meat on it and the crust was very good for a gluten-free option. I really enjoyed it (and it was HUGE). Our son had the gluten-free penne with chicken and pesto sauce, which he thought was very good and his girlfriend had the gluten-free penne with bolognese sauce. They ran out of bolognese, so she got marinara with a HUGE meatball instead. She also thought it was very good.  The inside of the restaurant is quite rustic, which exposed brick. It also has large chandeliers which although not to my taste, do work well with the decor.  All in all, I can't give this less than 4 stars as our meals were all very good. I'm sure the hiccup with the late dish was just because they're a new restaurant and haven't yet worked out all the kinks. They gave us the late dish for free and and another $17 off because the service was slow, so we honestly can't complain.  The service (other than the one mixup) was really great. Everyone was very friendly and very attentive.  I'd recommend this restaurant and we'll definitely be going back soon, maybe just on a less busy night :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here today. I was not in the mood for anything heavy, so I decided on a soup and the avocado and goat cheese bruschetta. I would recommend the full portion. It was so fresh and delicious. I could not get enough of it. The ambiance was nice and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"In from Texas visiting and have to say service was stellar first and foremost. Tried lunch and dinner pastas and was impressed with the meatballs. Heard the pasta is made in house.  Been open three months. A must try"}
{"text":"Great good, great staff. Love the light fixtures and tables. The homemade mozzarella is amazing. The pizza and scissors are fun. Great place for family dinner or night out with friends. The chandeliers are pretty and the tables and chairs are all mismatched in a charming way. It's comfortable and homey but not in a cheesy way. Staff is always chatty and friendly. They sign the cheeseboard, which is a cute touch.  Desserts are really good but if you have to choose between appetizers or desserts, the apps, especially the mozzarella are the best, so go that route.  This is probably my go to restaurant right now since it's right for pretty much any occasion. Since this location opened up, it's easier to go to, especially before or after a movie."}
