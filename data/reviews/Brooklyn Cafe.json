{"text":"First time at Brooklyn Cafe.  Food was good, service was very good, greeted by owner.  But, way overpriced for a neighborhood restaurant across the street from a McDonalds and the grocery.  Name \"Brooklyn Cafe\" doesn't reflect food or prices ."}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise! This was our delayed Valentine's Day dinner and it was fantastic!  We were greeted by the owner, Martin, who was very nice & hospitable.  I was a little worried because it was close to 6 and we were the only ones there.  I had no need to worry.  The folks started coming in steadily after that.  Our waitress was delightful & knowledgeable.  We both started with a Goat Cheese Salad that had walnuts & white beets.  Very good! My husband also had a terrific Shrimp Bisque soup.  Savory broth & lots of shrimp.  As an entree I had their special Dover Sole that was deboned at the table.  A perfectly cooked and beautifully presented filet served with a lemon/butter sauce on the side to complement it.  My husband had a very tasty Beef Bourginoune (?).  Our desserts were also very beautiful and tasty.  Unlike a previous review, we didn't think they were at all overpriced \"for the neighborhood.\" The quality of the food was excellent and the portions were perfect.  This will definitely be a return destination for us and we live almost an hour away."}
{"text":"My wife and I were big fans of Voltaire so we were anxious to try the new and improved Brooklyn Cafe. We did so Saturday evening and were greatly impressed both with the new decor and the menu.  Chef David simply prepares great food! We love his preparation with fresh and local ingredients. On this visit my wife had the walleye special and I had the veal special.  The walleye was perhaps the best we've ever had (and coming from the Midwest we've had a lot of walleye). Fully cooked, tender, moist and very flavorful.  The veal was as tender and tasty as I could have possible expected. Because of the outstanding nature of our two entrees I almost forgot to mention the wonderful tomato bisque and goat cheese salad we started with. As usual, the service was wonderful, and the price was VERY reasonable!   We'll be back (again and again)."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been long standing clients of Voltaires. When they changed their name we were pleased to find out that the wonderful menu had not changed. My favorite Lydia's Chicken was still on the menu and the beef burgandy is to die for! The new look is crisp and clean with a full bar to compliment your meal. Always a pleasure to dine at this neighborhood, upscale restaurant."}
