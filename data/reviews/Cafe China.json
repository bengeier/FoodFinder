{"text":"One of the better Chinese restaurants out west here.  Spoiled by East Coast Chinese food (where you can actually get duck sauce)  Restaurant is clean and owner & staff are very friendly & accommodating.  Love the Sesame Chicken & Orange chicken.
Actually used them for my daughter's graduation party last year and they were great; lots of food at a great price.
Check it out."}
{"text":"I always come in here for lunch(11-4) and for 6.25 you get so much food, it's awesome. The employees are really nice. Very nice restaurant. I've told multiple people to try this place and none of them have been let down. Very fast, food comes out hot. Never waited over 10 minutes for my food"}
{"text":"Great food. More traditional Chinese flavors. Great friendly staff. Love this place! Will definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was horrible Chinese. Every appetizer I received was fried including the Choo Choo steak...gross. 
I've had egg rolls like these before although those were frozen taquitos.
The Hong Kong chow mein was semi-decent but the sauce was basically watery oyster sauce."}
{"text":"Food is above average, ambiance is good, service is attentive, prices seem quite reasonable. Best wor wonton soup I've had in a long time. Excellent little neighborhood place - may they live long, and prosper!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Come here quite often. The wait staff are so sweet and lovely.... if nothing else they alone are worth coming for. But their food is tastey fresh and served in really generous proportions.   This is not assembly line crap - this is good well seasoned real food with deep flavors and genuine variety."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have great customer service and the food is awesome!!  The Warsaw firsh is my favorite!!  Very generous portions always have a good leftover lunch the next day...or dinner the same day if I'm lucky enough to have it for lunch.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, not from the area and used to outstanding Chinese food. The price is reasonable and server was friendly. Had the combination of sweet and sour sauce with broccoli and beef. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Very good and super reasonsble prices..
Quick service but not rushed.. had lunch special and added a side of S&S chicken with drink under 10.00"}
{"text":"My new go to chinese restaurant.  The ladies who greet me when I come in are warm and friendly.  The place is clean, and always have something to read if I have to wait for my order.  Their shrimp with lobster sauce is so good.  Yes, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Never eating here again. Insects in food. Ordered sizzling rice soup. It had a strange burnt smell to it, the rice looked a little dark, so figured it was just a bit overcooked. Nope, it was the smell of burnt INSECTS. A couple minutes into the soup I found an insect wing floating amongst the rice. Fished it out and started examining closer, found another floating wing, then a bug body. Then another bug body with a wing still attached. Needless to say my stomach felt turned upside down after that. It took a lot of ice cream to get rid of the burned insect flavor in my mouth...   No no, Cafe China, never again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions and friendly wait staff. This is a family favorite. We love to go and have their hot and sour soup which is very tasty or the wonton soup which is delicate and amazing. We usually get one of their combination plates, so there are several different entrees, plus appetizers for less than $10.00 per person.
The food is tasty, the sauces well done and I can't say enough about the terrific staff.
My family and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"China Cafe is clean and inviting the staff is warm and friendly. Food is fresh and delicious.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are good sized. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"The Worst Chinese food I have ever had I worked 10 days in row wanted Chinese 4 dinner take out Came home got in my pjs now it's SO BAD IN getting dressed 2 bring the garbage back Save your money this place sucks"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in city. Awesome food and really courteous staff. I visit this place every other week."}
{"text":"So sad to see them go :( They have been a favorite since they opened. I hope I can find another Chinese restaurant just as good close by."}
{"text":"After all of the positive reviews about this place I was pretty excited to try it. Unfortunately I am yet to find a place that has good Orange Chicken - not a hint of orange in it! Anyway, I wasn't impressed, the fried rice was just blah."}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow, we waited at least ten minutes before asked what we wanted to drink, then asked for two teas and were brought one. Food was over cooked and chewy. I ordered the sweet and sour pork, which was subpar, my boyfriend got the beef fried rice which was not the best but okay."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to go to! The service staff is so amazing! I love how friendly they are! And the food has never disappointed! Their hot and sour soup is delicious! The lo mein is cooked to perfection, it has the perfect amount of flavor. It doesn't overwhelm your pallet but has you lambasting everything all at once"}
{"text":"I tried this place based upon other Yelp reviews and I was very pleased.  I find it difficult to find a decent Chinese take out in my area,  so I drove a few extra miles to Cafe China. I loved the Sesame Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork.  The Black Pepper Beef was also good with a lot of fresh veggies,  but not as spicy as I thought it would be.  The Lo Mein  was also delicious.  I was a little disappointed in the potstickers and egg rolls, but everything else made up for it.  

The staff is wonderful and very friendly.  The restaurant is very clean,  which seems to be a rarity with most Chinese places in the area. I definitely plan to return to Cafe China."}
{"text":"The egg flower soup was delicious, but the rest of the meal was fairly bland.  Service was very friendly. Would have liked to see the whole menu other than just the lunch combos."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Chinese food place to get some takeout, not from the area and came across this little gem! Friendly staff, food was done fast, and it is delicious! I would come here all the time if I lived in the area! I got general tso chicken, the lo mein, chicken and vegetables, all were great. They even threw in a couple egg rolls no charge. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Service was great and my take out was very well packaged. They even packed the sauce in a separate bowl so that my chicken wouldn't get soggy. How nice is that? However....the food is nicely prepared in that everything was cooked, cut properly, and it was warm, but it's super generic American-ized Chinese food. I hate to say it, but Panda Express's food is more flavorful. I ordered a chicken combo plate which came with egg rolls, crab puffs, and egg drop soup. The chicken and sauces weren't flavorful. The soup was nothing special. The only things I really liked were the peppery spring rolls and the crab puffs which should have been called cream cheese puffs. The fried rice is decent too. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting Pei Wei or some kind of creative gourmet fusion. This is nothing more or less than the classical American Chinese food experience - what Chinese restaurants were when I was a kid. 4 stars for food but 5 stars for service with a smile and reasonable prices for lunch, dinner and happy hour. And 5 stars for the Ginger Broccoli Beef! Sad to hear others have negative experiences but I've been here about once a month for the last year and have found it consistently good."}
{"text":"My wife had tried this place when we first moved into the area and said it was very delicious. I decided to finally try it tonight, and I was not disappointed. We had egg flower soup, pork lo mien, and sesame chicken. Everything tasted as if it was made fresh right before it was given. The chicken was tender and breaded very well, with extra sauce on the side. My wife is from the NY/NJ area and said this is the kind of Chinese that you would get in the city. Fresh and authentic. Give it a try...you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. We went to the restaurant and ordered to-go. While we were waiting, we let the babies (both 11 months old and just walking) walk around. The woman who had taken our order, though, brought us some water and saw the babies toddling around on the concrete floor. She warned us that if the babies hurt themselves, the restaurants insurance was not going to over it.... Ummmmmm ok? Other than that, it was pleasant. She offered to help us bring the food to the car since we had babies to carry. Oh and when she originally took our order, she couldn't figure out how to spell \"cashew\" so she wrote it in Chinese: LEGIT."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick Chinees food. Their lunch special runs till 4 and it's a good deal. You get a meal with soup, cheese puffs and egg roll  for less than $10."}
{"text":"New to the area and I've been looking for some good hot and sour soup. When I'm sick, it's literally the only thing that helps. Cafe China's hot and sour soup was 100% out of this world! Best I've EVER had! They're super friendly and the prices are superb! You definitely get more than your money's worth! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Mm mm good. Just had dinner. Everything was fresh, tasty not bland. The Veges were crisp and fresh. The egg rolls had just the right amount of ginger. The tea was delish.  We had the full dinner, one was sea same chicken and orange chicken, the other broccoli beef and Kung Pao chicken. Came with hot soup, crab wontons, shrimp, rice. We are stuffed! Best we have found in West Valley. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and really great lunch specials for a good price. The staff is awlays friendly. The egg frop soup is top notch and they always food out quickly so you can eat their on your lunch break."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place for a year, and absolutely love it.   They are very friendly, and it's very clean inside.  The lunch specials are amazing and plentiful to eat.  Sesame chicken with lo-mein is always a favorite!"}
{"text":"Since our favorite Chinese take out place closed, we've been looking for something to fill the void. Café China may not be our go-to like Pink Lotus was, but it hit the spot. Their Cashew Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Sweet & Sour Chicken were all very yummy. I agree with one of the other reviews that Cafe China's crab puffs were good and are liberally stuffed unlike other places that make you wonder if you actually ate a wonton instead. The shrimp roll was unexpected and tasty while the egg drop soup and egg rolls weren't great. When all is said and done, we would return since it was a lot of good food for the price., but maybe omit a few of the not-so-great sides from our order."}
{"text":"If you are in the Glendale/northwest Phoenix area and are craving good Chinese food, this is the place to go. The restaurant is very clean and nicely appointed, and the staff is very friendly. A quick glance at the prices in the menu will immediately tell you that  your dining experience will be very easy on the wallet. The quality of the food is definitely above that of most of the Chinese restaurants in this area of the Valley. Since I'm often in this area, often hungry, and often craving good Chinese food and have a limited budget,  I believe I've found a new favorite dining spot."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised!  This place is fantastic!  I loved the General Tso's chicken combo.   It is spicier than at most places which, for me, is a good thing!  I highly recommend this place if you are around Thunderbird and 59th Ave!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The place is clean and the people are very friendly.  I ordered the General Tso Chicken lunch combo and I was extremely overwhelmed with the garlic.  Maybe it was an off day....I would consider giving them a second chance given how friendly the staff was."}
{"text":"Neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall. Generous soup portions, hot and sour good but I still prefer Abacus Inn for hot and sour. Chicken curry good, I prefer a little hotter but not complaining.  Lo mein very flavorful.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Stopped here this past weekend for lunch. Have tried 2 other Chinese restaurants in Peoria area. This is #1 we feel. Very clean....greeted pleasantly. Bright decor. Food was excellent and very fresh. Staff very attentive and were happy to serve us. We recommend highly!"}
{"text":"New York style Chinese food - excellent value for combination plates. We're an extended family, prices make going out affordable and food is best I've found in Phoenix since China Doll and Kadys closed. Service is excellent. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"New to area..,found this gem and now found out they are closing for good on Aug 27.,,get there while you can"}
{"text":"My favorite favorite place to go! Love the soup, all of them and all of the food is good. If the food wasnt enough the people and the sevice will be. For years we have been going here and they ask about out family, by name each time. Nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu.  Tried Cafe China for the first time today and absolutely enjoyed my Lo Mein bowl with pork (I chose the barbecued pork).  I asked for snow-peas and they added it at no extra charge.  My friend ordered the Vegetable Egg Foo Young and the portion was tremendous, fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly, inviting and courteous and their Take-Out menu offers numerous dishes.   I'll definitely return...it was THAT good!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my first visit to Cafe China. The first thing you notice is that the restaurant is immaculately clean. The second thing you notice is how pleasing the staff are to you and thirdly the food is solid good.

I tried the chicken coconut curry. The chicken was moist and had a good ratio of vegetables. They made it a perfect spice level for me. It was unlike any curry that I've tried at other Chinese Restaurants so it wasn't what I expected but it was good so that didn't matter. The curry here was more like a tasty light and thin Asian Brown sauce that was lightly curried and topped with some coconut. 

My husband tried the Black Pepper Chicken. Again nicely cooked moist chicken with a good ratio of vegetables and it tasted the way this dish normally taste.

They use a combination of jalapeno peppers and chili flakes for heat in the dishes.

I liked that you can order brown rice here and they are accommodating to people who like spicy!

Cafe China is Good!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to grab a cheap meal.  Nothing special about the food, but I can't complain too much.  Good service."}
{"text":"not only was the pork lo mein lunch great, but they offered me two kinds of pork. for $1.60 extra you can add about a dozen items as extras to your meal. but the real reason for this review was some most unusual service. i lost something i had last seen on the table but couldnt recall if i left it behind or not. when i went back they had not found it but they reminded me i had been to the bathroom and immediately one of the workers put on gloves and started digging through the trash. no go, so after searching my car, purse, the sidewalk, etc. i went back in and they let me sort through the trash myself and gave me fresh gloves too. my item ended up being in my car, sigh, but i can attest to the fact that in my quick view of the kitchen it looked fine to perfect, and they separate their trash to recycle. the area and floor both in the kitchen and by the trash bins was spotless. they took my number in case they found it later, i thought the food was dirt cheap btw. got soup, egg roll, crab puff, fried rice, pork lo mein, requent water refills, and a side of orange chicken that was twice as large as servings at panda express. i paid under $9.00 for it and i will most certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Felt like some Chinese food so I yelped Chinese food and this place popped up. I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. This place is very good and different from any other Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. They offer you a selection of protein and a selection of sauces so I decided to have shrimp and pepper and tomatoes in dark sauce. It was excellent. It came with fried rice and I ordered a beverage and an egg roll all for under $13.00. 

Service was great too. I definitely will be returning to this place and recommend it too."}
{"text":"Found this place quite a few years ago I haven't been here in a while but its still very good. Hot and sour soup as great flavor and the Kung pow 2 was better than I expected!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret!! Amazing service! Excellent food all the time! The lunch specials can't be beat anywhere. And I absolutely love how these fabulous ladies always remember what I love to order and are so courteous and accommodating. If you are in Glendale and want an awesome Chinese meal get over here!! My favorite is the chicken lo mien or the kung pow chicken ask for the special menu they have full of special recipes not on the published menu they will literally make you anything! Try the beef chow fun OMG that was a special treat!!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not bad, not great. Had teryaki lunch combo with brown rice. Flavors were very light, needed more spices, more sauce."}
{"text":"This is a perfectly acceptable chinese restaurant. The food was quite tasty. The rice was not too sticky. The eggroll was not too greasy and quite good. The chicken was very tender. The egg flower soup was not the greatest. The restaurant looked clean and the service was very good and friendly. The food came very fast, kind of too fast. I will probably go again, but get the food to go instead of dine in. I don't think it was a great dine in experience, but the food was reasonably priced and good."}
{"text":"Nice little place inside, people were pretty friendly. I liked that they had a stack of magazines available for you to read while you're waiting for take out.

The food was okay, I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and the sesame chicken - not the best chinese I've ever had, but the price was really cheap which is always nice."}
{"text":"I had an appointment that was pushed back 45 min utes. I was famished and needed something filling and quick. I saw a Burger King, a couple of grocery stores, a Chipotle (I think), and this place. I beelined for Cafe China. Chinese food would fill my empty stomach tank just fine.

I was seated right away and the server (maybe owner) was very kind. She got my order right after getting my drink. The soup came out in less than a minute, sesame chicken lunch special in about five. I chowed down on piping hot, seemingly fresh food. The sesame chicken had the same \"base battered meat\" as sweet and sour chicken, so I was a little disappointed in that. But the portions were perfect--enoguh to fill me up, not put me in a food coma like most Chinese food does. 

I was done eating within 20 minutes and made it back to the appointment with no problems. I hope to try this place again."}
{"text":"There's plenty of parking here. 

The place is very clean. Even the bathroom. That's one of the biggest things about a Chinese restaurant...I should know being Chinese and knowing many owners, investing, etc. I never give up a chance to try a new Chinese restaurant...though, some that I've been to I would think twice again about. This place, wasn't like that. 

The food is delicious and not greasy or packed with MSG like a million other places. The prices are cheap. Service is very good and fast. They don't have delivery but take out is available and like I said, it's fast. They do have alcohol but sadly, no full bar. I like drinking quite a few different cocktails and shots. 

I usually get the Singapore noodles. They're nicely fried and has been delicious every time I've gotten them. Crab puffs are good.

I would definitely recommend this place and would come back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Sad to see them go, this sat August 27th they are closing their doors forever. Let's go make it a great weekend and go have some wonderful food and even better service! Happy retirement to the owners but you'll be leaving a huge hole in my heart that only your fried shrimp can fill. Cheers to cafe China and thank you for all you've done for our neighborhood. Xoxo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Service was excellent. Highly recommend the pot stickers and the orange chicken."}
{"text":"I need to bump this up a star.  Having been here a few times now it really is above average for what it is.  The food is always good, never get crunchy rice.  The service is always quick and friendly.  They go their beer and wine thing sorted out a long time ago.  The only thing I would change now is: I happen to prefer sitting in a chair than a booth and the last few times I have been in they have all 8 of the tables set up in pairs to seat 8.  If one of those pairs was split in to 2 4tops then I would seat at a table rather than a booth."}
{"text":"Solid place, I was impressed. Had a large group and did takeout smorgasbord of several entree items: chicken dishes: spicy chicken, Kung pao, teriyaki, and orange. Shrimp lo mein and broccoli beef. Fried rice was outstanding, and what can I say about white rice? Egg rolls got rave reviews, as did the crab puffs. I've never seen a better organized takeout. EVER. And to top it all off I loved my fortune!  I will insist we go back when we are in the neighborhood. Thanks fellow Yelpers for helping us find this gem!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Came for lunch. Had egg drop soup with my combo which everywhere else is super plain, but here it included some vegetables and bamboo shoots-super good. Also, have brown rice as a healthier option which I think is great. I had Mongolian chicken-very tasty."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe China a couple times now and it's the perfect place to go for a quick lunch. They get you in and out and the service is speedy quick and the food comes out quick. It's never been busy the times I've gone in and the ladies working there are very nice. Their lunch specials are pretty cheap. $1.25 extra for a combo which includes your choice of entrée as well as an egg roll, crab puff, egg fried rice and a bowl of soup (hot and sour or egg flower) I chose the hot and sour and i thought it was delicious-It's the perfect combination of hot and sour."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh and big portions what more could you ask for, everything we tried was great, Generals Tso chicken was crispy and not overly sauced, place was very clean and service was outstanding. We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"My husband would go to this place when it was metro center. The service is still great and food delicious."}
{"text":"We were driving around this part of town and craved some Asian food. I Yelped it out and found this place with lots of good feedbacks so I got pretty excited myself. 

My family and I went here around lunch time on a Friday. As soon as we walked in, the hostess greeted us with a smile. 

We had the crab puff as our appetizer, nothing really special about it BUT compared to other Chinese restaurants, theirs was the biggest and most filled crab puffs I've ever had! I had the Mongolian beef combo, the beef was so tender and the veggies were cooked just right! Not soggy but not undercooked. Their egg flower soup was also great! My boyfriend ordered the chicken chop suey and he was pretty satisfied himself! My daughter loved the lomein and orange chicken (I did too). 

Overall the service, price, food and ambiance was great! It was a nice experience so we are definitely coming back to try some more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Good solid mass market  Chinese American food. Excellent value with the combos. Staff are great.   The food is above average for the price point, service certainly above it.It would be a solid 3 star place.

Tried five dishes, two soups and had no complaints with 4/5 of them. The sweet and sour pork was just not to our tastes,seemed overcooked . Soups came out fast and entrees followed along at just the right interval. 

While it's 3.5 / 5 I've rounded it up to four because the sum really adds up to more than the total of it's parts."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say except that the people on here with anything below a 4 star are just miserable people, or they don't know what good food is. Okay the fried rice is just okay, but the rest of the food is exceptional! This clown that gave theme a one star and said there were a bunch of bugs in his food is full of crap! My wife and I discovered this place on accident and we keep going back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite hole in the wall! Great flavorful food! And easy on the wallet! Monita is my favorite server always consistent and good!"}
{"text":"This place is so great. The staff was so friendly that I tipped almost 45%! The food was delicious and the combos are super big and plenty to take home to enjoy an hour later when you're hungry again. I have been there so often and I now recommend them as the place to go on the west side. Please stop in and sit if you can, you'll fall in love with the staff just like I did."}
{"text":"Not even worth the 1 star, I ordered the general Taos chicken and I could of gotten better from panda express. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Good food, clean and quiet restaurant!
Food was okay, seemed fresher than most Chinese restaurants. I asked for my dish, chicken and vegetables spicy but it was too much so. Nicely served plates, complimentary hot tea, a plus. Multiple servers waited on me, but no one came back to see if I was satisfied and I had to search out someone to give me the bill."}
{"text":"When you first walk in this place you'll notice how clean it is.  For me personally, that's a big deal.  I hate going into places that stink or look like they haven't cleaned in weeks.

We sit down and the nice lady asked us what we would like to drink and since we knew what we wanted, we ordered our food.  This place was real busy for such a small establishment and I could tell she was stressed, but yet she remained cool.

they have these great combo places that are your straight up Chinese food choices.  I opted for some lo mein and fried rice with chicken.  It came with an egg roll (not the best) and some crab puffs.  I really enjoyed the meal.

My girlfriend got something that I dont remember... she offered be a bite of it and yeah... wasnt a fan at all.  I think it was the sauce.

I would go here again.  It was close to home and pretty affordable."}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've tried. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp fried rice and added jalapenos and XO sauce and it was delicious! Its not on the menu but you can ask for it. The beef chow fun was good too but a little plain."}
{"text":"Favorite place for a quick lunch. Very clean, staff is super friendly and attentive. Food is awesome, at a great price for a large high quality amount. Love it"}
{"text":"Very nice environment and clean!  Staff very friendly!  We had an order of crab puffs (very hot and okay tasting).  We also had sweet sour chicken and the seafood delight with brown sauce. My husband stated that the chicken was okay and I have to say mine was as well.  Not too much taste - the server did offer to make it spicy, but I said \"no\" - I'll give it a try.  It was a bit bland - veggies very fresh.  

If we go back, I would try something different.  Lots of take away business though...."}
{"text":"Came here because everyone knows the unassuming spots in strip malls are where it's at. Was not disappointed. 

I don't even like egg flower soup, but I like theirs. 

They recognize that Ceylon tea is for casuals, and serve Oolong instead. Legit. 

The $9 combination plate it was included in was too much food for the price, but still didn't suck. Orange chicken was full of garlic and just the right amount of spicy. Sesame chicken was also great. Crab puffs are above average. The miniature fried shrimp are also a nice touch. There's no way you can finish this in one sitting! 

Only regret is that it's way too greasy. When you deep-fry something, you've gotta at least attempt to get some of that extra oil out! I forgive you though, Cafe China. While I might pursue some other options, like coconut curry, I have a new go-to place for Chinese in the northwest valley."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last Friday, and I was not impressed. The food was mediocre and by far the worst food I have had in a while. On the other hand, the staff was very friendly. The dinning-room was very clean. This didn't make up of the lack in flavor. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! And I've never been when I didn't have the place to myself. Best Chinese takeout I've had in phoenix."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to eat Chinese food ! I recommend everybody to stop by here for lunch always! It's super delicious and the service is amazing, combination 'C' is my personal favorite and I just can't help but love this place everytime I visit !"}
{"text":"Excellent service, awesome vegetable fried rice. Highly recommend this place. Great experience for a first timer, and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Really good food, very reasonable price, very good service, they are the best in this area Fo Sho.  I've tried the sesame chicken,  orange chicken  combo it was bomb.  Going for Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken tonight.  Take out is good ta go as well."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite restaurants and best Chinese food in the area. Customer service is top notch and you won't find a friendlier or more accommodating staff anywhere. Food is consistently good and atmosphere is always pleasant. Food is very affordable and the place is nice and clean. Great for families."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible! Had the mongolian beef with white rice. The service was absolutely spot on as was the food. I recommend this to anyone anywhere. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is \"okay.\"  I had the mongolian beef. It was very tender which I like.  It was really cheap - like $5 or $6.  I got mostly rice and not enough meat though.  A bunch of us from work ordered here.  One woman got the orange chicken and took one bite and refused to eat the rest.  For the record I tried it and it wasn't that bad.  But she didn't like it.  Overall I would say this place is pretty average.  Nothing special that you'll crave but will fill your need for Chinese food if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley and being from the East coast we are picky about Chinese food. Great pork foo young. Very friendly staff and great prices for the combinations where you get a lot of good for your money."}
{"text":"Good food all around but the best feature of this restaurant are their combination specials. For around eight bucks you get two entrees with hot and sour or egg drop soup, vegetable fried rice, an egg roll, two crab puffs and two fried shrimp.

The owner, Monita, seemingly takes great pride in her restaurant and the quality of service she provides. The only thing that this place is missing is delivery service."}
{"text":"This place give you a TON of food for a great price.  The lunch specials are awesome, and the staff is fantastic.  Co-workers and I go here for lunch often because it's so good.  I get teh General Tso's chicken and its amazong."}
{"text":"Great service!! We were not sure what time this place closed when we pulled up at 9:30p. Turns out they close at 9p, however, one of the employees - or maybe the owner - came out and offered to make our food to go if we wanted. We took them up on the offer and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Chinese spot! Food is delicious and the service is wonderful. Very friendly and welcoming upon arrival. Food is hot and ready very quickly n they have even let me place take out orders close to their closing time for my convenience. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"More like 3. 5 stars but I bumped it to four. The food is okay not outstanding and not bad at all. Good lunch specials. A lot of food. I have come to the conclusion that Arizona just does not have any really great Chinese food places. However, I do give this place 5 stars for the service thus the bump. The ladies are the best here. They have the nicest wait staff around. 

Another thing to note is that the prices are pretty good here compared to other places in Glendale. When I am sick their Hot and Spicy soup is more economical than other restaurants. It is not as spicy as I like but they happily give me more hot mustard and chili sauce to add at my leisure. I am good."}
