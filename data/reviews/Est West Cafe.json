{"text":"I've been coming to Est West at least twice a week for the last seven years. The salad selection is great, the prices are very reasonable, and the portion sizes are huge. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem.  Tucked away in the small hydro building food court, this place has been visited by hospital medical staff for lunch since time immemorial.  What defines this restaurant is their \"salads\".  A large \"house salad\" is in fact a vegetarian meal where you can load up on mashed potatoes, pasta, various veggies, legumes, and fruits for around $6.  Go for a salad special and you can get a sandwich or salmon fillet with the salad for under $10 total."}
{"text":"Love their House Salad!  Wide range of vegetables to choose from, including kimchi and cold noodles. I have tried their All-day-breakfast too, freshly served :) Good portion for students.  Very friendly staff.   This place is now one of my favorite in the Grange areas."}
{"text":"Absolute best hidden gem of an eatery downtown! The food is delicious and healthy - and very reasonably priced for the neighbourhood. The staff are absolutely wonderful - Gloria will remember you if you go there often and will always be so happy to see you and welcome you there with such a friendly demeanour.  The healthy, tasty food, Gloria and the great prices are what keep me going back here. It's located in the grange food court and isn't visible from the street, so it remains a hidden gem in the downtown area. If you're nearby, definitely go!"}
{"text":"When this first place opened up I was in mourning for the lost of my beloved Island Foods that once occupied it. Where was I to get my patties on a bun or my doubles? Even if they were served with an indifference so chilling it gave you shivers. I eyed suspiciously at the swift renovations and at the Korean family that buzzed around when they took over the place. Then scoffed at the menu. Western omlets? Sandwiches? They really took fusion food literally in their name.   It wasn't until sitting in class when a friend of mine plop herself down with chopsticks and opened a gigantic box of food, that had been straining to stay closed. What is THAT?  For $5.64, she explained, they take a large container and cram it with every imaginable salad, cold noodle, and Korean panchan as possible. As long as it fits in the box, you can get whatever you like.   Poor (as a student usually is) and hungry (that too) I went back the next day and nearly laughed at the mound and the variety of things they put into my take out container. Is is awesome? No not really.It was good  and it definitely wasn't horrible. For a working student with no money and an appetite it was still perfect."}
{"text":"So much variety for good prices. The small or large salad is always a good option, but I went for one of the \"daily specials\" and got a panko breaded, fried pork cutlet with rice and I still got to add from the salad bar. Only $7.90, huge portion and really tasty."}
{"text":"Love this cafe. An amazingly fresh, tasty, healthy and generously sized salad for five dollars something - with expensive ingredients like asparagus, mango and strawberries, is a treat among all the run of the mill fast food places. The food taste like quality and makes you feel great after ward, and this location makes the salad with better ingredients than other Est West locations."}
{"text":"Best kept salad bar secret in the universe...ok, the downtown core!  Order a small salad, step to the left, and gaze at the wonders through the window!  They had these falafel ball things that were a combination of egg & chic peas--incredible!! Everything is super fresh and the small order was stuffed to the brim; all for $5!!  Crazy-good!"}
{"text":"Great place,  lots of delicious food.  I got a honey garlic chicken,  rice and salad/soup special for 6.99 and it was super filling. The salad is literary a pick and choose of a bunch of things (noodles,  Kim chi,  mango,  coleslaw,  etc). Amazing value for price."}
{"text":"My new favourite eat. Impressed with the quality, quantity and affordability of this little place tucked away in this city's best food court, The Village By The Grange. Wished it opened more than Monday to Friday."}
{"text":"As a stingy vegan OCAD student, this place has provided me many a cheap lunch on a long day - especially when Karine's is mysteriously closed. I always get the large \"house salad\" which is less a salad and more basically anything on the bar in a box, for $5.65, which is a steal. Fruit is always fresh, lots of healthy Korean-ish options. Can't speak for much else on the menu though!   The ladies here also love me and tell me I'm beautiful while piling noodles into my take-away container - what more could you want."}
{"text":"Always a no-fuss and tasty option. Potentially healthy as well if you make the right choices - there are lots of fresh vegetable and fruit choices that I never go for (and that the smiley server will try to encourage me to have more of, instead of fried oily goodness)."}
{"text":"Meh.  I came here in search of the same food I used to enjoy at the Village by the Grange Est West, which is now gone. They have a more cramped space to work with here which likely affects the number of sides they're putting out - but at Village by the Grange I could count on at least two green vegetable options every day (not counting lettuce), while the selection here was far more limited, carb-heavy and less green.   It's a bummer. I really enjoyed the Est West at Village by the Grange, but (apart from a much better job cooking the salmon) this is just not the same."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you come for quantity over quality. Which isn't always a bad thing if you're looking for a cheap lunch place to eat. I came here for their salad bar that I've heard good things about. I ordered the large salad for $6 including tax. It was my first time here so I wasn't sure how many choices I could order but I quickly found out that it was AYCP...all-you-can-pack! They literally filled it to the top and squished the lid over the food. Like I said in the beginning, this special was all quantity over quality so the food wasn't anything amazing but it was fine if you're looking for a basic salad bar with some korean options."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I was at a meeting outside my usual area where I grab lunch.  Come that time I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't the usual boring salads that I normally pass on. I find most salads are mainly lettuce with a few ingredients on top... INSTEAD this salad had a wide range of delicious ingredients ranging from grilled asparagus, brussel sprouts, mango, glass noodles, rapini, and pasta shells etc.  With all these ingredients I naturally assumed the salad was at least $8.00 but I was told it was under $6.00.  As mentioned before this isn't my usual neighbourhood where I grab a quick bite but I may have to take a walk there again soon!"}
{"text":"I am writing strictly about breakfast, as I have not tried any lunch items. The breakfast is available all day, btw. The menu looks quite extensive in terms of soups and sandwiches. They also carry some Korean food items.  The Village by the Grange food court (near Dundas and McCaul) has a number of independent or smaller chain businesses operating there. I enjoy the selection of this food court in general, because the options offer something unique and at a lower price point than many other places.  There are a couple of places you can get breakfast; but Karine's does not appear to be open early enough on most mornings to actually get breakfast at breakfast time. McDonald's is kind of expensive ($3.29 for a McMuffin sandwich, or over $4.20 with a hashbrown patty and a small coffee).  At Est West, for $3.99 I got 2 eggs any way I want, 2 slices of toast (white or whole wheat, and i think english muffin is an option), bacon or sausage (2 medium sized breakfast sausage), and an option to fill the rest of the rectangular takeout container with fruit (watermelon, strawberries, papaya, canteloupe, orange, grapefruit, or honey dew), or home fries.  My order was eggs over-easy, brown toast, sausage, and assorted fruit.  The ladies who work there are bustling and getting ready for the lunch shift in the background. One flashed a quick smile when she caught me trying to sneak a peek at the progress of my breakfast (takes about 5 minutes to fry up). Another one greeted someone behind me who must have been a regular customer.  At the end, when my order was ready, it was bundled with some napkins and cutlery and the lady asked if i needed a plastic bag or if I needed anything else. I accidentally dropped my fork while picking up my order and she promptly replaced it and threw my ground-fork in the garbage for me."}
{"text":"Got severely food poisoned from the steak sandwich at Est West last Wednesday, March 22. If you get the steak sandwich make sure to get the meat well done. I made the mistake of asking for medium and paid the price for a week. I am finally recovering. To be fair, this is the first time I've ever had issues with the food there. In fact, before this incident I quite enjoyed Est West as a quick substitute over making lunch or dinner. Unfortunately, I won't be returning anymore."}
{"text":"Best value lunch in the area.  The small salad from the salad bar is under $5 and you can choose from a variety of fruits, veg and noodles.  You can also get their veggie sushi with salad for $5 - not the best sushi but big portion size for your buck and you can grab and go if you don't have time to wait in line at the salad bar.  If you're feeling like breakfast you can order their breakfast special: 2 eggs, sausage or bacon, home fries or fruit and toast.  Again, under $5!"}
{"text":"One of the best Open Salad Bar!  Lots of vegetables choices. I love their Tofu Ball. Sometimes they have stir fried lotus root in their salad bar. Friendly staff. Very affordable."}
{"text":"Overall: Great place for really cheap, really random and very filling food! Come here if you're looking for affordable food with a wide selection.  Location: It's in the food court right by Queen's Park station.   Price: For $5 you get a small clear box, and $8 you get a large clear box. You can fill it up with as vegetarian much food as it can fit. The selections are really random and ranges from glass noodles, to pasta salad, to mashed potatoes, to fruits. The workers will pack it very full for you. I love this because you can get so much variety, and they don't charge more for each additional side. You can also order a meat + rice for around $10, and stuff it with as many sides as you want.   Food: The taste is decent enough for the price. Everything is slightly on the saltier side.  Service: Very fast, very efficient, right up my alley."}
{"text":"Serves decent food for a quick bite on the run for breakfast or lunch.  They may load up your salad box but are rather cheap charging me extra for jam in my toast as substitute for butter (which costs more in the grocery store last time I checked) and then they give some people free peanut butter at no extra charge.  Inconsistent pricing is not a good business practice.  I also saw them preparing a BLT behind my order and they just chopped the head of lettuce in the order counter to put on the order without washing it."}
{"text":"Found this jewel this morning after reading the raving yelp reviews.   It's tucked away in a food court around the OCAD corridors. I was happy to find a healthy array of breakfast selections. They have everything from green shakes to the classic eggs, sausage and toast combos.   I suffer from iron deficiency so whenever there is a steak on the menu, that's what I'll be ordering. Pan seared steak, two eggs fried to your liking, fresh fruit of your selection (strawberries, kiwi, grapefruit, melon, cantaloupe, watermelon, blood orange, papaya) , hash potatoes and two pieces of buttered toast all for $6.99 + taxes!   There is an army of pleasant and quick Korean ladies working the kitchen; I was able to order and get my meal for takeout in 5 minutes.  Great value for your buck. Definitely recommend a stop by if you're in the neighbourhood.   Accepts cash, debit, credit card (surcharge)."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. Have you ever had the business owner (I presume) of the restaurant yell at you? If you haven't, and don't ever want to, I suggest you avoid this place. Their food is decent for the value but holy moly I wouldn't ever come back here again.  I paid for my Korean Ribs with rice and sides and was waiting in line. It was lunch time and so there was a crowd. Unfortunately, the ordering system was trash here at Est West, because we were all confused about when our orders would be called. I was standing literally in front of the employees on the other side of the food bar and just casually chatting with my friends, when the restaurant owner starts screaming:  \"HEY! YOU! IM TALKING TO YOU! STOP TALKING WHILE IN LINE! LISTEN FOR YOUR ORDER!!!\"  I looked at them, buried my desires to scream back because I have that much more civility, and stared at the other employees. So I asked them, \"So, what am I supposed to be paying attention to?\" You know what's hilarious though? I waited for a solid 3 minutes before my order was called.  So wait...hold up. I paid YOU money, and you yelled at me? Haha good luck staying in business.  It was a terrible experience overall. I will not come back, no matter how value the meals are."}
{"text":"I often get food from their salad bar, or order breakfast items. Why I love this joint? Generous portions Great prices Great variety of fruits, pasta salad, unique korean sides"}
{"text":"First time here from a co-worker's recommendation for cheap and effective breakfast. Will say I didn't realize how much they give (seems little) but you're full for a good chunk of your day after the one meal."}
{"text":"Went to Est West for lunch with a friend today and it was great! I ordered a large salad bowl and they let you fill it up with as much as you can fit in there. Be warned: if you're someone that doesn't like their food touching, you won't enjoy the salad.   I filled mine up with glass noodles, spicy udon (so good!), beets (steamed), potato salad, kimchi (delicious!), steamed broccoli, sauteed green peppers, tofu balls (they're like unsweetened timbits), chick pea salad, and tofu with chilli sauce. They had a lot more options including fresh fruit, sauteed carrots, snap peas, pasta with tomato sauce, pasta with tuna etc.   The total was $6 including tax which was a steal especially for downtown. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Try their $1.00 Banana Bread its amazing. The staff are so personable and friendly . Food is fresh, healthy and affordable which is hard to find in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, and healthy! Perfect for students, and much better than the healthy offerings from campus. For $5, you get a large salad of your choice (steamed vegetables, pasta - glass noodles and the spicy noodles are so good!, fruits, tofu). Their line up gets long around lunch, but the staff are quick and efficient. It's a bit confusing for a first timer: you line up to pay under the \"Order\" sign, then get back into line under the \"Salad\" sine (follow the crowd)."}
{"text":"I work in the building and this is my come-to when I'm working a late shift and the cafe has already closed. The large house salad is the best deal, you get to pack the container full of any of the selections from the salad bar.  My personal favourites are the tuna pasta salad and the broccoli florets (they toss it in some sort of dressing that makes it irresistibly delicious).  You can see into the kitchen and whenever you're ordering a hot dish (eg. protein salad, hot chicken sandwhich), they make it in front of you and always error on the side of being generous; I'm often amazed by their stacking skill.  Debit and cash only, credit cards not accepted."}
{"text":"This is a secret haven for anyone that works in the area. Best bet is to go with a salad small or large. Everyone in my office just asks for a bit of everything and you get yummy food for the entire afternoon for hardly any money. The sandwiches here are pretty good. Make sure to go before noon or after 2 because the line ups are insane. I feel bad for the other restaurants in the food court having to deal with that competition.  The server ladies are so friendly too and they will take care of you with yummy food."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, served quick and in large portions.  They have a counter offering a variety of cold salads and some fruits.  Ever since this place was sold to different owners, the recipes for the some of the salad choices have changed.  They've also eliminated some items such as the mango salad (unless it's a seasonal option) but out of the 10 times I've went.  They never had it, when it use to be available everyday.  The customer service has also gone downhill. The new owners,  I'm referring to the husband and wife at the cash register are rude and abrupt.  You would never see any other employee taking your order or money.  There are plenty of places to eat in the area, that have much better quality food and service with a smile."}
{"text":"Got the bugolgi with rice and salad after 5 on a weekday. The rice was pretty cold and wet and they loaded a ton of the side dishes into my take out container which I didn't want. But I didn't complain. They also dumped a ton of bugolgi on afterwards.  I wondered why they gave me SO MUCH FOOD. Even more than last time but it was because they were closing and wanted to get rid of everything as much as possible. The side dishes weren't as flavourful (i.e. the potato, kimchi, udon noodles) but I did enjoy the bugolgi (though a bit salty) and the cabbage.  Good intentions, good service, but food quality does not increase with portion size."}
{"text":"Love the grange!! Working near by, Est West is an office staple.   Ambience: 3/5 ... food court. Cheesy signs. Friendly people, and clean.  Food: 4/5 Today, had Kim chi, Glass noodles, korean fish cake, and fresh fruit and cut veggies.  Value: 5/5 Get a box ($5.65 in May 2014), have it filled to the brim with assorted cold foods and fruit eat two meals!... or share with a friend."}
{"text":"I actually work in the same building as this place which is the only fast food restaurant I buy from in the small food court.   FOOD: Their food is great because of the cheap price! I don't mean the food tastes cheap either. You can get a big box of salad for $6 (tax included). Now what do they mean by salad? They mean any fresh fruits, vegetables, noodles, potatoes, tofu balls, stir fry etc. they have that day and they will pack it into your box. There's just no meat. If you want meat I would recommend getting a sandwich or their special of the day which ranges from: korean style chicken, beef, fried chicken, etc. All the food tastes decent and again you just can't beat that price.   Service: Not the friendliest bunch but they do have a long line of day time workers to feed. Super fast though.   All in all, I love this place and it's very affordable for the good quality food that they serve. Also they have $5 breakfast!"}
{"text":"Your first time to Est West can be a little intimidating, as you can get stuck in the Subway or Manchu Wok lines, and it's not inherently obvious that you order and pay at Est West on the side closest to the corner of the food court, and then you go back in line to obtain your salad.  But follow everyone else, or don't feel bad about asking.  This place is getting a real following from regulars... I work with a few.  As has been stated by other Yelpers, the main attraction here is the fantastic salad bar.  I'm not really one for pasta salads and creamy side-dishes, but they do have an abundance of sauteed vegetables such as rapini, broccoli, sugar snap peas, mushrooms, and zucchini/carrot/mixed veggies.  I wasn't expecting much, but they were cooked perfectly!  Not mushy, not oily, still very crisp and colorful, and not over/underseasoned.  To add more nutritional punch, there is a variety of fruits, such as strawberries, mango, oranges, watermelon, and cantaloupe.  You can feel good about eating out for lunch!  If you want to beef up your meal with some protein, you can get a salmon fillet with your salad (comes out to $7.90), or the spicy chicken and rice (comes out to $7.33).  The chicken sandwich is also quite tasty, especially with bbq/Sriracha sauce.  The Korean crew behind the counter will indeed take good care of you, and you can't miss them with their bright pink uniforms.  My favorite is the cashier lady in charge who called me \"my love\" once.  Aw!"}
{"text":"They CHARGE 50 cents if you use credit card :(  pretty decent food. tasty and cheap. the lady accidentally packed me \"too much\" of the expensive ingredients, overhead the owner complaints lol."}
{"text":"The salad bar is amazing for the price. Located near OCAD, this takeout place has long lineups but they quickly fill your order. With an order of protein like salmon, chicken or beef ribs, the ladies ask the sides that you want with your order.  The range of items include veggies, pasta, crystal noodles, fruits and other yummy treats. For the price of less than $10, you are easily filled up and satisfied.  It is definitely great value for what you are getting.   They have breakfast as well although I have not tried it.  Although there are many other choices in the food court, it is one of the popular venues.  Give it a try and you won't have any regrets."}
{"text":"My favorite spot near work for a healthy, light lunch. Their sandwiches are delicious, and much like I'd make at home. Everything is fresh, and the soups are particularly good. Plus, the ladies behind the counter are the sweetest people you'll ever meet. The lineups tend to be a bit long during the lunch rush, but it moves very quickly."}
{"text":"with huge turnover rate and awesome fast staff, this place is perfect for lunch. i have never seen a take-out container filled like they do here.   generous amount, lots of choices. only take cash or debit cards.  don't take too much fruits in your salad, takes too much container room :P"}
{"text":"In a nutshell - GREAT VALUE, fast, friendly service, convenient location for MaRS researchers/hospital employees/students, so-so food.  I've been ordering lunch here basically every weekday for the past 2 semesters. I always get their small ($4.20) or large ($6.20) salads. Like other reviewers have mentioned, they truly do pack their salad boxes to the absolute brim!!! So getting a small salad here for lunch is usually filling enough to last me until dinner. Salad selections may be perceived as unique - Asian influences here with the kimchi, green beans, seaweed, soft tofu, bok choy, bean sprouts, etc. I love the tofu balls (they look like falafels) even though they're mostly made of flour, not tofu. Rice noodles and pastas are also available if you prefer something heavier in your salad. The food's a little ratchet? Yes. But for the portion size you're paying basically nothing for and the nutrition (better than manchu wok, mr. souvlaki etc nearby), it's so worth it!! The manager (the dude) is also very nice and all the salad bar staff who prep your salads are also so friendly, cheerful, and so pro at packing those boxes to over max capacity.  Note- they only take cash or debit I believe. And note the closing hours - they close pretty early if you're considering getting dinner here."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only gotten their $6 \"big salad\".  The first time, I found out about this place, I was amazed at how much food you could get for so cheap and was beyond excited to try the big salad that the fellow yelpers have been raving about. I tried it twice and I must say, I never want to return there again.  The selection for the salad never changes and resembles a very poorly executed chinese buffet. There's some fresh fruits (that they dump on top of you meal??!!), a lot of carb heavy food such as noodles or pasta which is slaughtered either in tomato sauce or mayo. Some boiled broccoli, glass noodles, spicy noodles.   Overall, just a lot of carbs in different types of sauces, some half cooked veggies, more stir fried carbs. Also, do not get the tofu balls, its 70% flour, 30% tofu...  The man operating the cash register is quite friendly. I haven't tried their normal food yet, I've seen quite a lot of people get it so I might give it a try."}
{"text":"I like this place for a cheap lunch.   Only thing I've ever tried is the 'home salad' which is just a salad bar of all sorts of goodies, including veggies, pastas, other noodles, Korean sprouts, fresh fruit...etc.  It's delightful.  Never a big line.  Quick service.  They do not accept credit card.  Only faux pas.  There are plenty of places to eat in the Grange, many of them are pretty good.  Don't be intimidated by the outdated decor of this food court.  It's top notch."}
{"text":"so im writing this review as i eat my food from them LOOL  so i have been meaning to try out this place for a while now. i was a little skeptical because idk a lot of the places i have tried at the grange weren't the absolute best and they had relatively high ratings but this was actually pretty damn good  i ordered the spicy chicken combo with tomato soup (there's like two soups you can choose from) , rice, and two green sides: broccoli and green beans. starting off, the chicken is pretty good like it's not too spicy and it's not too salty. just the right amount. the sides were standard but the rice ...idk i have a big appetite and the rice PORTION is so LITTLE IM A BIG GORL but then again it was only around like $7 so i can't rly complain and their soup portion is pretty generous (the soup was alright, more flavour would've been great) but idk for me i prefer more rice than soup  BUT YEAH ANYWQYS STILL GOOD AND I CANT WAIT TO TRY THE OTHER STUFF"}
{"text":"I study and work at OCAD so I'm pretty much eating here at least once a week. I've only ever gotten salads and sandwiches- both of which are usually very satisfying. The sandwiches are basic sandwiches, but they're quite fresh and well portioned. The salad is basically \"fill as much as you can before the lady shuts the box\" picked from an assortment of various vegetables, pasta salads, fruits and side dishes. The place is Korean-run so they'll have things like kimchi, kimchi pancakes, etc. Most of the regular items are good, sometimes they'll throw in something new and it'll be a complete hit or miss (in my experience). This place is great for getting a healthy and relatively cheap meal in the area, and even in comparison to the rest of the Grange. You definitely get your moneys worth. (The best is when your box has gotten so full they have to wrap an elastic band around it just to keep the box closed eurherheherh)   Like with most places in the Grange, my main gripe is inconsistency. Some days you get a better meal than others and there's really no predicting it. Some days you'll come in early and still manage to get an item that smells like it's gone bad (I just bit down on a sour piece of watermelon before writing this review), and some days the lady will just pile on extra fruit for you. All in all though- for the price you pay you never really get a *bad* meal, so it's still always worth it.   SIDENOTE... am I the only one who finds the lady who works at the counter absolutely terrifying?? (is she always there, or is she just always there when I'm there..?) I avoid going at busy points (the golden noon lunch period) just because she gets so much more intimidating when there's a line up behind you."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I do not work close (Wellington & University) but that does not deter me from making the trip up to Est West Cafe for its cheap and delicious salad. I would say that the salad bar is the focal point of the cafe because they have a handful of korean sidedish-inspired items. I need to emphasize that I am not a salad person but this salad bar has had me coming back every other day for it!  The large salad is $6 and small salad is $4, and it can be stuffed with as many items as the container allows, so don't be shy to ask! The salad bar also has a great selection of pasta, noodles, an assortment of veggies, and fruits. I would recommend the following:  - Glass Noodles - Kimchi - Beansprouts - Beets - Tuna pasta (simple but tastes perfect!) - Kale - Tofu balls - Chickpea - Mushrooms  The order and pick-up system is orchestrated by two lines. Line up at the cash register first to pay for your order and then proceed to the next line on the left handside for pick-up. I would recommend heading there early during lunch time because this place gets busy after 12pm."}
{"text":"I come here every once in awhile when I want something healthy-ish and easy on the wallet.  If you want an assortment from the salad bar, just ask for the House Salad. It comes in small $3.68 or large $5.64. What I got is the large. You just ask for whatever items you want until it fills the container.  Tip: I find that the green items closest to the cash (broccoli, asparagus, snow peas, brussel sprouts. etc) are sometimes a little too salty. I usually skip them."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after seeing U of T. Don't be fooled by the good reviews-- this is not a sit down lunch restaurant or cafe, it's a fast food counter in a dingy mall basement. I had an egg salad sandwich, which was good compared to the other options typically available in a food court. DON'T order anything with meat, the chicken in my soup was repulsive. If you're looking for a quick bite between classes that won't make your stomach curl, this is a good spot. The staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis.  It's reasonably priced, healthy food with plenty of choices.  Staff are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I particularly enjoy this for the salad bar..many different options to choose from. Glass noodles, pasta salad and the herb tofu balls are personal favourites. They do prefer cash-tends to be much faster."}
{"text":"Great food for great value!  Tucked inside Village by the Grange, Est West offers a wide variety of fruits and salads along with their sandwiches/breakfast menu. I often find myself coming back whenever I'm looking for a cheap lunch. The tuna pasta salad and broccoli salad are staples whenever I order here. They also have potato salad, tomato salad, asparagus, marinated tofu, etc. They serve some Korean dishes like glass noodles and fish cake that I enjoy. Fruit is fresh whenever I go - watermelon, strawberries, orange, melons... you name it.   The small house salad is around $3.75, the large one $5.65. Definitely a steal for all the food they give you. Staff are friendly and smile all the time."}
{"text":"A small efficient non-franchised weekday lunch choice in a busy food court. This place always seems to have line, even when the other choices in the food court is quiet. But they are use to the rush of people so your wait will not be long.  They are well known for their salad boxes, where you can choose from their open bar of fresh salad/pasta/noodles/falafel. They proceed to cram your selection into whatever size box you've paid for until it's full and may need an elastic to hold together. I've started exploring their other menu options over time, like their western sandwich and breakfast items. They cook everything to order so it takes a minute to get your freshly cooked meal but they are very fast and won't cut long into your lunch hour. A nice fresh option away from the typical greasy food court choices."}
{"text":"Tons of selection, large portions, great value. The other vendors in the food court look on in envy as est west has a huge line up during lunch whereas it's empty elsewhere.  I have to admit if you're a first timer, their menu is a bit confusing. When I ordered a main with a salad on the side, I expected a leafy green salad. Instead, I got a bunch of appetizers to accompany my main like noodles, veggies, pasta etc and they don't seem to limit how much you can get. I could get 2 meals for the price of one! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"They used to be great.  Now not so much.  I bought an apple from them 2 weeks ago and it was rotten on the inside.    I also ate from their salad bar last week and it didn't sit well.   Today, they're just not honest.  I bought toast today and the board said $1.  In the past, I'd be charged more if it's not white or brown bread.  Today I had brown bread and I was charged $1.30+tax.  When I asked why I was charged more than what the board said, the owner said the board prices are 10 years old.  Very disappointed as I used to order from them daily for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Est West is a hidden gem, perfect for a fast lunch to go. The star of the show is the salad: $3 and change for a small, $5 and change for a large.  This Korean operation (there's about a dozen working behind the counter at any one time) has a salad bar that would make any Halmonie proud. Note: the line-up can be daunting, but it moves rapidly. There are actually two lines: one for paying, and then one just to the left for service.  Salad options include: chap chae (glass noodles), tons of veggies (broc, asparagus, mushrooms, beets (!), etc.), cold pastas, potato salad, kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, lots of fruits (mangos, oranges, watermelon), and more.  You may encounter some hastily chopped items: orange with lots of white rind, woody asparagus; but these are forgivable given the high volume.  Protip: if you order the small, they load up both the sides of the square clamshell container. This is a great value, but can lead to disasters upon opening. The large is definitely easier to unload."}
{"text":"This food court gem is a must try. The workers here are so generous, what they mean by salad is actually you can have as many options as you want and get a whole box full of food + a delicious piece of protein. You can choose to not have rice and just stuff your box with various sides instead. The lunch special of a giant meal is only 8.99. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm near the area, I always drop by Est West. I love, love, love their salad bar!  I always get their small salad for $4.20 (including taxes).  They have a huge variety of salad/veggies that you can choose from that they put in the box.  They definitely fill your box to the max.  Lots of variety such as steamed broccoli, pasta, seaweed, kimchi, spicy noodles, tofu, fruits, etc... to choose from.  Great tasting food for a low price....def will come back whenever I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place except that it's super cheap, super tasty, and I am really jealous that I do not live in this Toronto neighborhood so that I could eat here every morning.   The $4 breakfast  gets you two eggs, bacon, toast, and a mountain of fresh fruit. And  the fresh fruit is really the star here. You get honeydew, cantaloupe, grapes, pomegranates and a variety of berries. You easily pay twice, maybe even triple this price at any other establishment.  They even sell freshly baked pound cakes. I've tried the pumpkin one and the banana one, and boy, for each $2 half loaf, it's a steal."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich is perfect and it's only $2.50. Cheaper than anywhere else and it tastes great."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in the neighborhood. Quickly made, fresh and cheap. A very wide selection of food and fresh fruits. I order their breakfast sandwich special whenever I skip breakfast."}
{"text":"Love their generous portions of salads (raw & cooked vegetables, pasta, Korean dishes, fruits, potatoes) and can order it with a sandwich, rice and meat option, or they offer burgers, breakfast foods, baked goods, etc. Great find for student budgets and their location in the Grange food court is usually busy with OCAD students next door.   They also have their first location at queens park station (beside UofT) where I used to frequent very often. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place, used to come here almost every day and it was always busy. Owners are friendly once they recognize you, and it's a fast-pace ordering system which is good for little wait times. Food is always a hit, love how they change up their salad options but the classic items are always there (tuna pasta, asparagus, bean sprouts, snap peas, spicy udon, cold tofu etc). Not your typical cheese and meat western salads, more like a gigantic portion of various Korean sidedishes for under $10. Their sandwiches are also amazing (ciabatta gets you the most filling) and they prep it right in front of you.   Will always be a loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"Fresh salad, generous portions and affordable price. Definitely healthy lunch place in Hospital row. TIP:  Try the fried tofu balls!"}
{"text":"THE best salad bar on Hospital Row hands down. Heads and shoulders above Cultures, Druxy's, and any hospital cafeteria. Est West is hidden in the OPG Building food court, directly connected to Queens Park station. I am eternally grateful to the colleague who introduced me to this place. I feel sorry for the other businesses in the food court. At lunch hour, there is always a long line-up here while the other places are far less busy. But how can they compete? Est West has the freshest, healthiest, yummiest food AND the best value.   I usually get the small salad. I really like the glass noodles, chick peas, broccoli, pasta salad, and fresh fruit. But the most unique item is definitely the TOFU BALLS. They are on the left side of the salad bar and are sadly overlooked by many people. They are lightly battered and fried and taste amazing! Way better than the regular cold, spicy tofu that they also have.   The sandwiches are also great, $5 or less, and you can choose what type of bread, cheese, sauce, etc.   The line moves quickly and staff are always smiling!"}
{"text":"Obscene amount of food for the price. We're talking an over stuffed take out box for under $10. Which just unheard of in downtown... More like suburbia prices.   I got a combo with rice, chicken and salad. Except  salad is a general term that is more like \"get any 5 sides you want\". I'm talking noodles, pasta, broccoli. The \"salad\" alone took up half the box and bigger than most full meals.   Good tasting food at extremely good price"}
{"text":"The Staff here is so friendly and try hard to be funny. I like the effort. Also after pouring my rice, she asked if I wanted more rice...how many places ever asked you if you wanted more of anything? Also very good prices for the day's special and the amount of food is generous."}
{"text":"Whenever I want fast lunch service, more veggies, and a filling meal this is the place I go. For $7.50 I can get a large salad container and fill it up with anything from their salad bar. For $10.15 I get to fill this container with additional rice and meat (I usually go for their chicken options, frequently listed as option #1 on their screen menu on the top left side). As long as you don't mind an often pretty random assortment of food touching each other as you try to cram as much as possible into your container, it's one of the more worthwhile options I've found around the area. The veggies always taste fresh to me and I love their meat dishes. Servers are fast, efficient, and (usually) friendly."}
{"text":"I used to come here alot during my days at university for a quick budget friendly lunch. I went today after 4 yrs and not much has changed. I only come here for the large or small salad which is great deal for the largr portion. You basically get to choose to what to put in your salad box from a wide range of selection. The selection consists mainly of korean influences salad choices such as glass noodles, seafood pancake, tofu, fish cake and other stir fried veggies. There is also a large fruit selection as well. Today there were grapes , papaya, oranges, grapefruit and melons. It is definitely a good deal for that huge meal. There is usually a korean lady who fills up the salad box for you and she doesn't skimp out."}
{"text":"I had a salad earlier in the week from Salad Days located at Bloor and Yonge, and I fell in love. For under $5 I had a Cobb salad that was overflowing with a generous amount of avocado, chicken, feta, crisp lettuce, olives, fresh tomatoes and half a boiled egg. Unfortunately, I work in Queens Park, and making the trek to Yonge and Bloor is not always feasible. So after doing some research, I learned of Est West Cafe located a short walk away from my office. The Yelp reviewers rave about their salads.   You have no idea how excited I was with the possibility of eating a delicious salad for lunch whenever the craving hits. So at lunch time a few days ago, I just about ran to Est West Cafe. As soon as I entered the food court, I spotted them by the long line. I ran over and joined the crowd. While in line I was trying to figure out how the order process went, and it looked like you just told the people behind the counter what you wanted in your salad. So I paid for a small salad and proceeded to scan the options. To my dismay, I had very little time to scan the salad options since the people behind the counter were not exactly patient. So I chose a bunch of items on the basis of what seemed popular. I did not see any meat or cheese options. I think for meat you have to pay extra.   I walked back to my office with my salad in hand, but my excitement had deflated. The salad looked nothing like the one I had at Salad Days, and for the same price I did not even get chicken or cheese! Once at my desk, I had a few bites, and then threw the rest out. It tasted awful! Maybe I chose the wrong combination of ingredients, or maybe comparing this salad to the Cobb salad I had earlier in the week was not fair. Whatever it was, I am not going back."}
{"text":"Great place to get fresh, healthy food. A large salad is 5.95 as of this review. You pick whatever you want such as a variety of veggies, pasta salads, fruit, and cold Korean dishes. I also enjoy their spicy chicken. The portions are generous."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. I've come here numerous times for their famous salads. Just order a \"small salad\" or if you're really hungry, a \"large salad\". You get to pick whatever you like and they fill your container to the brim. The foods include pasta, fruit, vegetables, tofu, chickpeas, and tons of other goodies. This place is usually packed during office lunch hours. If you come, look to your right, those poor servers working at that Chinese restaurant - they never get any business because of Est West Cafe. Yum!"}
{"text":"They provide cheap food and excellent overall value. This place is run by a bunch of Korean ladies. They are all really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place for their mixed salads! They have many choices including kimchi, pasta salad (the than pasta is amazing) some noodles, greens, fruits and so much more. They also pack your container full so you always get a lot for your money's worth. If I worked close to here I would be coming every day!"}
{"text":"This is easily my go-to for grabbing food that's cheap, filling, and tasty when I'm at school. They're located in the food court right next to Manchu wok. You can take it back to the office or sit down at the food court which has plenty of seating. You pay first and then get to make your selection and/or pick up your order when it's ready.  Go during lunch time if you want several options when ordering a large salad. It's only $6 and they are hella generous! Make your selection from a variety of salads, pastas, fruits and veggies. The days I've went they had glass noodles, broccoli, tomato pasta, spicy noodles, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, kimchi, watermelon, tofu, and beets.  I also enjoy some of their combos that they have. Their chicken specials are flavourful and they give you plenty of meat. The chicken teriyaki comes with a cup of soup which is plenty of food. My recommendation for soup is the beef barley which is absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Est West Cafe is a great lunch option in the area. A small house salad is around $3.95. The portion is generous. You can choose from an array of items including raw and cooked vegetables (long green beans, eggplant, asparagus), pasta salad, Korean glass noodles,  potatoes, Korean pan cakes, fried tofu, and fruits.   Avoid the baked goods ($2) at all cost. At first, I was enchanted by the economic banana bread, but I soon realized there is a cost associated with its economy. The banana bread I had was hard and stale. The texture resembles brick. The flavour resembles brick as well. Not palatable in my opinion."}
{"text":"99% of the time, I love this place. The food is great and the prices very fair. You may have to spend some time discovering which ingredients taste good in the custom salads, but once you do, you're good to go. All-day breakfast #1 is a fantastic value as well. Spicy chicken combo is great as well.  What I absolutely hate is the inconsistentcy. It's not often inconsistent but when it is, it's infuriating. I'll list them here:  Most of the staff fill the salad boxes to the brim but a few will leave it half-full. Once I ordered the spicy chicken and I brought it back to work only to realize it was very, very cold and hard. I had no idea what went wrong there. Also, the staff don't speak english well so if you ask for a tiny bit of pasta, they may fill half your salad box with it. One of them didn't know what broccoli was and I had to point it out in their salad bar. Cashier errors also seem common. A few times some of the pasta and broccoli tasted very salty for whatever reason.  Still, the place is generally good."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here the other day. Not exactly a winner. Eggs were weirdly cooked, the toast was burnt, it was lame.  I have to knock this place back a skosh, because while their portion sizes are still massive the food really isn't all that. Still some decent finds, but it's getting harder to find awesome on the menu."}
{"text":"An absolute hidden gem. Super friendly staff (they insisted I take more vegetables!) with a wide array of different sides for about 7-10 bucks. There's no limit so you can try a little bit of alot of different things. E.g. one day I had pork katsu, cous cous, mushrooms, gai lan, kimchi, mashed potatoes, tuna pasta and watermelon in the same plate!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in the building to get a healthy meal.  They are very generous in their portions, especially if you get the large \"salad\"!  You can expect a variety of vegetables, tofu, glass noodles, tuna pasta salad, fruit, etc.  Make sure you show up early in the day, because they start to run out later in the afternoon."}
{"text":"i love it! it's the best lunch spot in the area. so affordable, fresh and tasty. the salad bar is a big hit with everyone i bring there. it's a huge serving for $5.64; they pile it on and the lid barely closes. the variety is pretty large. i normally get like 8 salads in my container. the veggies are really crunchy and the noodles are nicely seasoned. the carbs are decadent like pasta salad and smooth mashed potatoes. there's no lettuce in this salad bar!!! i'm a fan of the jap chae, udon noodles, pasta, rapini, sprouts, beets, asparagus, glass noodles, mushroom salad, chickpeas, brussel sprouts, and of course, the mango salad!! try it, it's busy for a reason."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is so kind and attentive and are happy to be giving you a good meal. The food is fresh and made with care and it's simply an unbeatable value. Ok, I sound like a bad infomercial now but seriously, where else can you get a heaping homemade salad for under $6? This morning I got a delicious home-style breakfast sandwich and a medium coffee for $3.65. You really can't go wrong. This place is my go-to and I have never been disappointed with the quality of the food, the price or the service."}
