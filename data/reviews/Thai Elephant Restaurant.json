{"text":"Nothing special. Spring rolls small and wrapped too tight. Not enough noodles to fill me up. Meals came out about five minutes apart even though we were the only ones in there."}
{"text":"Love it. Great vegetarian and carnivore options. Welcome to West Park Thai Elephant!"}
{"text":"This place just changed owners, so we decided to give it a try. It was amazing! The spring and summer rolls were perfection. The duck soup was filled with meaty duck pieces and a tasty broth. The entree we tried was the beef green curry. Rice was cooked exactly the right way with the spice level of the dish exactly what we wanted. I can't wait to go back for more. The service on our takeout order was also very courteous and the new owner even offered us water while we were waiting for our to-go order to be ready. All in all, this is well worth your money for excellent Thai food."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on our first leg of a cross country road trip after finding out another Thai place we were originally going to was closed. I'm glad the first place was closed because Thai elephant was great!  The decor was nice and it was very peaceful inside. We had a couple apps and entrees and could not have been more pleased with the quality of the food. The service was also excellent. Five stars!"}
{"text":"This review is for A Thai Restaurant, which used to called Thai Elephant. Let's be clear that their menu has changed and unfortunately not as good. Several reviews on Yelp are for Thai Elephant and they should be removed! 
They used to have excellent Tom Yum soup, but now the basil, chives and bamboo shoots have been replaced with cabbage and tomato pieces. The broth seemed like dirty dish water and lacked the fresh spices. 
The Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, and Thai Basil were still pretty good but they have definitely increased the heat level. Usually we order medium heat and it was almost inedibly spicy.
Unfortunately we won't be returning to A Thai Restaurant. Brown Sugar Thai and Thai Spice are better options."}
{"text":"Been there several time for take out for Panang curry, jungle curry, Tom Yam soup and the Siam seafood special. Choose your heat level carefully...\"thai hot\" is pretty damned hot. The menu is genuinely authentic and flavors rich and complex. I was bummed when they removed the shrimp cake app off the menu. No complaints otherwise."}
{"text":"Spicy garlic chicken was amazing just like being in Thailand.  Everything they cook is always delicious I had the pork and basil last time. The atmosphere is like being in Thailand the beautiful thai artwork the waitress and owner are both thai.  Such a peaceful  environment to have dinner.  It's nice to see such friendly and helpful staff who will guide you if you don't know thai food or will spice it up if you already love thai food.  Hands down best and most authentic  thai food in Ohio let alone the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I seriously made an account just to write this review. I have spent a lot of time traveling throughout Thailand. My wife and I have been let down countless times on sub par pad Thai.  Let me tell you, their pad Thai brought me right back to Chang Mai and I can't believe how authentic and amazing their pad Thai is. I will for sure be a return customer."}
{"text":"We are so happy this place opened up in our neighborhood! We have searched for good thai food around here to no avail. We have tried the pad thai (excellent but would recommend ordering extra sauce on the side - especially if it is a to go order as it dried out on me once), the pineapple fried rice (pretty good though not much pineapple to be found), sweet and sour chicken (was ok), Pad Se-Ew (excellent), Tom Kha (good, pretty standard for thai), golden bags (good, but nothing crazy good), and the crispy rolls (great - we keep ordering these every time). 
The staff is very friendly but 3 out of 4 times we have been there (for take out) they have told us \"25 mins\" and when we arrived it took 10-20 minutes additional for our food to be ready. The most recent time I was told \"15 minutes\" and my food was waiting when I showed up after 25 minutes. Just beware it may take longer than you think but they may also be fixing this issue (I hope). Overall we hope this place makes it and will be regular customers!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Authentic Thai food beautifully presented. I thoroughly enjoyed the green curry with rice noodles and chicken. My brother, a newcomer to Thai cuisine, was totally amazed, couldn't get over how delicious the food was. Fried pot stickers were spot on, too. The young man who served us (shame on me I've forgotten his name) was perfect in every way. We'll be back for sure.

{"text":"\"A\" is the name of the new owner and Gun is back!  The food is outstanding and with Gun serving again, it can't be beat!  We travel from the eastside of Cleveland just for this taste of Thailand.  It's well worth the trip!  I had my usual Pad Thai but others in our group had other meals and they all raved about the food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we really wanted to like this place. Ordered from here twice, and once got really great Thai food and once got no food at all after dealing with them for over two hours. The food is great, so I'm sure dining in is fine, but don't order delivery if you want food in less than an hour (or at all). We called three times to check on our order and in the end wound up having to get a pizza because our food was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"The 10 percent off coupon at check in was not honored so that was not cool. Food was good"}
{"text":"We went to the Thai Elephant for lunch to celebrate my birthday.the server was extremely polite with a big smile when she greeted us. We told her it was our first time there so she explained how to order. you pick a dish and then the meat to go with it. Everything was nicely presented and the food was very flavorful. The cost was very reasonable for everything we received."}
{"text":"This place ruined my birthday meal. If I could give negative 10 I would. My boyfriend & I came to thai elephant looking for some duck & they only had duck curry, so i thought what the hell lets give it a try its my birthday right.. Wrong, when the lady came from the back with my duck,my boyfriend said this bag is really light. But i still didnt check till i got home cause we were in a rush. Got home opened the bag to a half filled small container of duck skin no meat at all 1 tomato,2 bell peppers,4 pineapple chunks swimming in curry sauce for 15 bucks. SHAME ON YOU THAI ELEPHANT FOR RUINING A LADIES BIRTHDAY MEAL, & DAY FOR WAISTING 15 BUCKS ON YOUR WORTHLESS FOOD!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO THAI ELEPHANT. 

ps.. I didnt take a pic cause i was too pissed off!!"}
{"text":"I should have listened to the other reviews before ordering delivery. It stated 25 minutes for delivery online. We only live 3 minutes down the street but I'm sick and wanted some soup delivered. After an hour of the order not even being picked up, I called Uber eats and they told me the guy just picked it up and is in route. It took another 25 minutes before we received it (again we live right down the street.. I could walk there faster). So we finally got it. And it was missing half our order! We ordered two noodle soups and we only got the noodles! No soup! What am I going to do with plain rice noodles. So then we call and they tried to say that's how it comes! I'm sorry but what! Soup has a broth! And I've eaten plenty of Thai noodle soup and every time I've had broth. Will never ever go back! Which sucks because we just moved out here and left our old Thai restaurant behind! Grrrrrrr

Update:after my husband got home, he took the noodles up to the restaurant to show them. They ended up giving him the broth and a piece of cake. So that's cool. But still not going back. It's too expensive for such a headache"}
{"text":"Healthy portion sizes. Great tasting food. Timely service. Highly recommended. Awesome for date nites."}
{"text":"I normally would not add my two cents - but I am so mad about the money we spent for what we got, I need to vent and warn people.
My husband  ordered our food over the phone by looking at the online menu.  
Fresh Basil Rolls - $4.95 
Siam Seafood - $14.95
Thai Ice Tea - $2.50
Masaman Curry - No price on menu
Pad Thai - No price on menu
Shrimp Drunken Noodle - No price on menu

We were quite surprised that the bill came to $59.50.  My husband has ordered Thai food for years and is used to paying about $14.00 less based on same food choices.

The food was mediocre and very skimpy portions.

I am a big seafood lover. :The Siam Seafood had 3 mussels, 3 scallops cut in half to look like more, 3 shrimp about 4 calamari.  
Drunken Noodles (price) :  The same - a very minimal amount of seafood.

I tasted my husband's Thai ice tea.  It was gross and tasted disgustingly sweet with a fake dairy flavor which overpowered the flavor of the tea.
The amount of money we spent for what we got was a HUGE disappointment.  

I have a hard time believing the positive 4 star reviews on this restaurant for real.  Unless you have plenty of money to throw away and your taste buds are dead - don't waste your time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have ever had we had gone back several times to be sure it wasn't a fluke but it's just as good every time we go. The service is friendly and absolutely phenomenal. I just can't wait to go eat each time"}
{"text":"I've come here repeatedly now to be dismayed at how little chicken makes it into the Pad Thai  noodles. I ordered a $10 dinner and only had 5 votes of chicken. Shame on you, Thai Elephant."}
{"text":"Everybody is so nice and welcoming. The food is amazing, I feel like I'm in Bangkok again:) highly recommend Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup and noodle salad."}
{"text":"Super delish! Service is also very attentive. My husband and I ordered Tom Yam Soup, Somtam Salad with shrimp and Pla Pad Cha. Tasty and authentic food and good value - portion are relatively big and we had enough for lunch on the next day. Don't miss their Thai iced tea - it's exquisite! After 5 pm, you can park at the Monroe Brake shop nearby, which is very convenient. Overall it is excellent. Will absolutely go back again very soon."}
{"text":"Slam dunk! My girlfriend and I came here for dinner a few months ago and it was delicious. The service was friendly and gave us a special peanut sauce that rocked our taste buds.

I came today for lunch and got tofu pad Thai. It's got a nice balance of spice and sweetness, came with an egg roll and some vegetable tofu soup, all for under $7!!! 

Yes please."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We always call ahead and our food is ready in 10-15 minutes every time. We have never once had any issues with our orders and their food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not your traditional Thai place. Small portions, no liquor license and pricey (especially for the portion size). I won't go back again, but if they do a decent carrying I might be convinced to try again"}
{"text":"Had the spring rolls, spicy basil fried rice, and a thai iced tea. Everything was delicious. Staff was super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday evening while traveling for work and was the only diner.  Not really overly impressed with the flavor, or lack of.  Not bad, just boring for Thai.  I had the tom yum soup with shrimp(medium spicy), seafood salad(mild) and steamed rice.  Pretty basic, but two of my favorites.  The soup didn't have the spicy sour base that makes it special.  It had some kind of 'bits' in it that may have been vegetable protein, but not sure.  Pretty bland.  The salad didn't have a strong lime base for the dressing, and again, just boring on the palate.  Jasmine tea was good(loose leaf in the pot instead of tea bags) and the rice was fluffy/fresh.  Nice atmosphere and very clean.  Unfortunately for them tonight there was, according to the server, a wedding party next door at the bar/grill with some really bad karaoke sounding band/singer.  Kind of funny competing with the 'serene instrumental' Asian music they were playing.  Waiter was friendly and prompt with service."}
{"text":"I order food from here with my family the other day. This place is perfect if and only if you would like your food over two hours after it was ordered. I would never recommend coming here. In addition the food was Bland to say the least. I certainly don't think it was worth the waiting all that time. In fact I would in general just never recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is amazing both for dine in and take out. Their Thai green curry is a must and if you dine in you can bring your own booze :)"}
{"text":"Good menu and fast service. They had crab fried rice on the menu (usually the hallmark of a good Thai place). Attractive and comfortable layout."}
{"text":"i probably liked this a little more than 3 stars might indicate. however, you gotta deal with what they give ya.

food was good. I had Chicken Paradise which tasted better than it looked. the sauce was green and was a little visually off-putting but the taste was really good.

Danielle had the Pad Cashew Nuts Noodles. I tried it and the sauce wasn't my favorite but she liked it and that's what matters. 

We shared a couple appetizers - Thai Samosa and Steamed Dumplings. both were pretty good. 

I'd go back again, for sure."}
{"text":"We love this place! The nicest employees & wonderful food. I always get chicken yellow curry - medium & it's perfect!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I have been here twice and it has always been a delicious pleasant experience.
Green curry is my go to favorite Thai dish and they did not disappoint.  

It makes me sad that there are never any other customers besides me when I have dined in.  Not sure if it is the location.  Do only boozy Irish bro bars and Steak n Shakes thrive is Westpark??

Don't answer that."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland! I've tried almost all Thai places and this one tastes authentic! They use fish sauce and it's not Americanized Thai food!!! Found my new Thai place in Cle!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Not the best I've ever had (Basil in Canton) but everything homemade. The lunch special is a great deal. The tom yum was so fresh. Nothing canned here. The panang curry was good but could be spicier and was a little runny/watery. The rice also was badly overcooked and like a paste. I enjoyed the thai iced tea, too."}
{"text":"I usually get their food through skip the dish. They offer a free delivery incentive after $30 which is awesome. Food has been great whenever I've ordered from there."}
{"text":"Business trip with two friends, all of us like Thai food. They both had Shrimp Pad Thai (Level 2 / 5 spicy) & I had Massaman Curry with chicken (Level 1)

All of us thought it hit the spot but wasn't memorable or amazing. Server was nice. No one else in restaurant at 6:30p on Tues."}
{"text":"I really like Pad Thai here. Red curry is also great. They are doing very good job for serving me Thai food. Authentic!!!"}
{"text":"I miss thai food and not finding good options in Seattle. Found this place and was excited to check it out. Was not busy during lunch on Friday (norm?) And had not a great smell when you walked in. However, my waiter was very friendly and and the food was great! I ordered the thai iced tea, crab rangoons and panang curry. Very good!"}
{"text":"The food was so flavorful, I would recommend the Pad Thai for sure! Everyone was so nice when we entered the restaurant."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Perhaps I have high expectations because I eat Thai food on a regular basis. There are basics that are pretty hard to mess up. They bombed basic. If this had been my first experience with Thai cuisine, it would have been my last."}
{"text":"I'm between 2 and 3 stars with this place. I had the green curry with chicken for lunch, which was a small portion. The curry itself had a nice flavor, but it bugs me when they don't cook the vegetables through, and the green beans, bell pepper and eggplant were on the raw side. A little more effort in the kitchen here would go far."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The spicy basil Thai fried rice is my favorite. Everything I have had has been very good. They are always fast and friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were one of two tables here at 7PM on a Monday. Service was really slow and we had to send back a dish to be reheated because it came out cold. They were able to make me green curry fried rice (which is not on the menu) but the fried rice came out burnt."}
{"text":"Excellent takeout selection and wonderfully nice staff! We ordered just shy of closing time and they were very nice. Food is really good, too! All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's usually very quiet which I like, the people are so incredibly nice, and the food is INCREDIBLE. Honestly the best Thai food I've had, including some of the Thai food I've had in Thailand. Try their curries, and if you like noodles, their Pad See Ew is incredible. Take out is always good, but it's better when you eat it there (hot n' fresh). Support this wonderful local business!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Asian addition to the west side of Cleveland!

I stopped in for lunch for the first time over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised! The lunch specials were delicious. For between $6-9 you get to choose from a wide variety of entrees served with soup and an appetizer. Everything came out fresh and was tastefully presented. 

I will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"For starters we had the pot stickers, which were good! With lunch you get a small bowl of soup and a small spring roll and that was by far my favorite part of the meal! I had the red curry which was also good. I got it \"medium\" for spice and it definitely had a little kick. I am not a fan of the jasmine rice though, it's sweet, I'd rather have regular white rice..which I'm not sure if they have. I would definitely come back for the soup and spring roll and maybe see if I could get regular rice."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, worth every penny. The staff is always nice and the food is always great. More importantly their TomYum soup is the greatest!"}
{"text":"Really only 2.5 but they tried hard for good service so we will give them the extra 1/2.  

After a few trips here I've found the food to be fairly authentic and generous on the portions.  

The curry had good Essenes of coconut milk and the dried red pepper and cashew had a great smokey flavor that mixed well with the white rice.  

I've not found better close bye so if I'm in \"need\" of decent Thai food I'll be back.   

TIP:  get a booth, the chairs are very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I've had better and I've had a lot worse. It was ok. If we are in the area again, we would eat here. I did enjoy the prick khing  dish. Very tasty form of curry."}
{"text":"I work around the corner and am so glad to have Thai Elephant as a lunch option! Their lunch special is around $9 for an entree, chicken tom yum, and a spring roll. After seeing the other reviews, I went with the pad thai my first time there and it was so good that I haven't ordered anything else since. They say variety is the spice of life, but I don't really care as long as I can have their spicy shrimp pad thai at least once a week."}
{"text":"Panag curry and the fried tofu with and thai ice tea are great!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai resturant! The staff is so nice, one waiter helped us one time and remembered us the next time we came in and the waitress we had made sure to ask if either me or my husband were vegetarian. They are very attentive. Their yellow curry is delicious and this is like the one place that can actually make a good tofu."}
{"text":"What a bummer!!! DO NOT EAT HERE. We were so excited to have some good Thai Elephant take out for dinner last night, we ordered our usual favorites sans the noodle dishes, Chicken Satay, Tom Yum soup and some cold spring roles. When we brought the food home and started looking through it-something seemed off. My boyfriends chicken satay looked rubbery and small, with no charring from the grill, our cold rolls were missing shrimp and the appearance of anything fresh and were served with a  honey sauce..wheres the hoison sauce? and my tom yum soup appeared to be murky in color and had a bad smell of too much fish sauce used. Then it hit us, like a ton of bricks, this was no longer Thai Elephant and no longer the same standard and authenticity of great Thai food. This was the first time in my life I returned take out food. Brown Sugar Thai will be getting all our business!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of good, authentic Thai food and this place did not disappoint. Very flavorful on every occasion I've eaten there and the others I was with wholeheartedly agree. 
I've had the green curry, pad satay noodles, basil tofu, and tofu paradise-- very delicious. 
The only downside I've experienced is the wait for the food. If you're in a rush, whether dining in or carrying out, it will take significantly longer than you expect and they tell you."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and the woman was so nice and friendly (I was the only customer) and made great recommendations. The lunch special is a great deal - you pick protein and style cooked (rice, curry, noodle dishes). It also comes with soup and spring roll. Everything was delicious, HOT, and fast service."}
{"text":"I stopped in during a biz trip and was blown away by the quality, presentation,  and the taste of the food.  Mom and pops are so hit and miss and I was happy to let my server know how good it was.  Try the spring rolls with shrimp and the green curry with tofu.  Who'da thought there'd be great thai food near the Cleveland airport?"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Thai food we have had. Very authentic, great service and reasonably priced.  5 stars."}
{"text":"Huge bubble teas, compared to any other place around! My go-to dishes are the Red, Green, & Yellow Curries. Also Drunken Noodles and Shrimp Pad Thai. Always quick service when I have come for dinner. Their lunch portions are also a great deal. 

Heads up, they don't stint on spice! Also, they are closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"I moved here from NYC where I've had some really GREAT authentic Thai food. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered from Thai Elephant and their food was equally as delicious! My go to order is their pineapple fried rice, pad thai and a green bubble tea. This is one of my favorite meals in Cleveland. I've also tried their red curry, and it's perfect. I like how you can choose from five levels of spicy-ness when you order from an app. Excellent food, Thai Elephant! I'll be ordering from you again soon!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Thai Elephant for a quick, tasty and right on the money lunch. But the new incarnation is no good. 
The lunch soup was shredded cabbage in warm water. The lunch we ordered took so long that I had to leave and go back to work before I even got to eat. There were only a few other people in the restaurant so I don't really know what was going on. I wish I would have known that they changed hands or sold the business because the sign still says Thai Elephant. 
Lunch was mediocre at best. And it was $30 which my husband and I were both not happy about. But hey, at least he got to eat. I got mine brought home in a doggy bag. 
Super sad at the passing of the once great Thai Elephant. It was a great place."}
{"text":"I have gotten from here in the past (over a year ago) and it was good, but not anymore and apparently I'm not the only one that notices this based on comments. 

I ordered Phò and it was anything but, no fresh basil or cilantro, it contained cabbage and the broth was just chicken broth. It was absolutely gross. My husband got Pad Satay Noodles, it had 2 little pieces of chicken and the sauce was pretty terrible.  

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Crab ragoon, yellow curry wth northern noodles, chicken satay, and fried rice was lip tingling delicious! The crispy chicken not great -- a must miss.  Overall wonderful. Does a big take out business so the dining room felt empty. Would definitely come back. It's near CLE airport."}
{"text":"Loved it. Ordered the hot sour soup, crispy spring rolls and pad thai. Everything was fresh and tasty. We had no wait, that may change when people start finding this great addition to kamms!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent, the service is good and the prices are reasonable.  I'm not going to fill this review with some self righteous babble about what an expert I am on food. I think this place is good and you should try it."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of items for pick up, arrived 25 minutes later, and they sold the food to someone else. Good thing we didn't prepay."}
{"text":"Nice food and environment for dinner ! :) Staff there was so nice and helpful, that we shared a joyful moment here. Especially love the curry with chicken and sticky rice with mango. A very great place where people who like to have a taste of Thai should go."}
{"text":"Very very average. Spring roll was room temp and I asked for a roll with no meat and my vegetarian girlfriend ended up getting served with meat. The pad Thai is super average and the service was average. Much better places in the city for Thai"}
{"text":"First time there and was very happy with the meal the Tom Yam soup was very good and spice. My wife enjoyed her crab fried rice and the hot Spicy Basil was very delicious"}
{"text":"Me and my wife have been here twice. I got a chicken curry dish each time. The food was delicious, and I think it's healthier than most restaurants. Very reasonably priced and our servers were on top of everything, too."}
{"text":"Hands down the best thai food i have ever had! This place is amazing in every way - great food, awesome service, good prices and a quiet and nice atmosphere.  Our waitress was so extremely sweet and the food was to die! We had the spring rolls which were amazing. I ordered the pan fried noodles and my husband had a curry dish that he absolutely loved! We were blown away with how great the food tasted! And it came out very quick! Definitely will be returning and is for sure our new thai food go-to!"}
{"text":"First time at Thai elephant tonight.. very nice waitress. But there was a long curly black hair in my daughters dish. Yuk. Don't get a second chance to make a first impression. Spent the rest of the time eating our dishes looking for hair. Not fun. Entree with the hair wasn't comped either. Very disappointing, would not recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  Fantastic currys.  Great lunch specials.  Great service.  Authentic!  Sometimes they have homemade coconut ice cream....it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Found this gem while having service on my car.  Took a walk and there it was. Authentic and delicious. The menu has curry, noodle dishes, amazing soups and more. You have to try it as you will keep going back. It's that good. Service excellent as well."}
{"text":"Just ate there, not so good. Appetizers were way overdone and the portion was minimal. Sorry, unsubscribe."}
{"text":"Mmmm... thai food.

We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food at A Thai. Having moved to the neighborhood from a neighborhood full of booming restaurants, we were interested in checking out the restaurant scene.

We both love Thai food, so we went to try A Thai. We were seated right away and ordered our usual- I got the pad see ew, he got the pad kee mao. Both were delicious- the portions are big, the price is good, and the quality is good as well. Not too greasy, not too spicy, just right.... we really liked it. 

The menu is large, so next time, we'll get adventurous. But for your comfort thai food, A Thai is a great place to stop by to get it!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food around Cleveland. We have been going this place, we really love it and there are a lot to try more. Love it, I would recommend this place, so give it a try"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Thai place in all of Cleveland. I've never had a dish I didn't like here and if I lived closer I probably would be stopping everyday for dinner. I've had many things on the menu but my favorite is the classic Thai basil chicken. I've never been able to finish this dish in one sitting because they give you so much food. The aroma hits you immediately when they put it down in front of your. Its a sweet, earthy, spicy smell and the flavor is heavenly. Its not too spicy or sweet its just that perfect balance of both. The vegetables are thick and plentiful and the chicken is really good quality. Make sure you check out the many appetizers they have especially the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"A Thai Restaurant/Thai Elephant is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland. The new owners took over this spring and have done amazing things with the menu including offering a wider array of authentic Thai dishes. They are also working really hard to be allergen/celiac friendly, which is amazing as I feel comfortable asking them any questions and know they take great care in making sure what I order is prepared safely. They even developed a special gluten free sauce for their fresh rolls which is incredible!! They also do a great job with portions and presentation. Everything I've had is delicious but OMG the green curry is SO GOOD! And don't forget mango with sticky rice for dessert!"}
