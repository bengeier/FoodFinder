{"text":"After ordering clams, salmon and soft shelled crab which were fine, I was conned into ordering some \" special\" shrimp. I ended up with 3 lbs. of oddly double wrapped shrimp that was so spoiled they had to know it when they sold it. I used it for (successful) catfish bait and never went back!"}
{"text":"I wish I worked closer to eat their lunch specials, so good, reasonable price and fast. As far as the counter cases, hands down best shrimp in the area. Love trying a new fish when you see those beautiful fillets in the case. Appetizers are great too, we live it all there. Oh and fall clambakes from Euclid Fish are the best, little pricey but fun. Invite me lol!!!"}
{"text":"We found Euclid Fish Co. last fall while planning a clambake. They came highly recommended and I'll tell you why.  They provide everything needed and you pick up. Even the same day! They will rent equipment, basically everything but butane tanks. The prices are reasonable considering what is included.  They sell shellfish, fish, lobster, crab and make party platters, too. Lunch or dinner can be ordered by phone or email for pick up. No inside dining because they sell commercially to restaurants all over the state. It is a very busy establishment but they work very well with all components. Sandwiches run $1.99 to $5.99.  Shrimp baskets, bisques and monthly specials keep us coming back. It only takes a few minutes from Cleveland and you will wonder how you've missed them since 1944!  Any rating less than five stars needs their head examined"}
{"text":"Every employee is always incredibly nice. Their lunch menu is AMAZING -  a great fish sandwich for little cost. If you are unsure of how to cook anything,  they will give you advice on how to prepare it."}
{"text":"Have gone to Euclid Fish for years and always been happy. Last trip was a few months ago. Ordered their monthly special which was redfish and rainbow trout. Got steelhead trout which is nothing close to rainbow, more like salmon and perch. It smelled bad in there as well. Fish is an expensive treat. Just haven't gone back since. I mean mistakes happen but really? $30 trashed"}
