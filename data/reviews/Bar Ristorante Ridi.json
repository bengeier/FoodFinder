{"text":"I travel 20 days a month and this was worst service I've in the past year.  The sad part is that the staff had no idea their service was awful because they were never properly trained.  I sat down at the bar and waited 10 minutes as the one server and one bartender chatted with their friend who was charging her i-phone.  I finally ordered a corona and it came with no lime.  The bartender then left and continued her conversation with her friend and server.  Oh, I forgot to mention, I am the ONLY person in the bar/restaurant.  After another beer I asked the server to see a menu.  I ordered the pheasant ravioli (which was quite good actually), but I never recevied a napkin.  When I asked to see the wine list and ordered a bottle of Pinot to go with my duck magret (not so good), the make-shift bartender brought out a bottle of champagne and proceeded to open it.  I quickly stopped her and asked for the bottle I ordered.  She then grabbed her friend's i-phone and had to make a call to someone to make sure I got the right bottle of wine.  I was laughing/feeling bad/annoyed by this point, so I told her I would just have a glass of the house pinot.  To her credit, she filled it to the brim and made an apology.  I give this establishment 2 stars only because the bartender and server were extremely nice - they just had absolutely no idea of what they were doing... I might come back for a casual drink but I would only stick to beer - I would prefer not to have my cocktail prepared via a mixology app..."}
{"text":"I was staying at the adjoining hotel and went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  The decor and atmosphere were very pleasant.  Service was excellent.  Our waiter was very friendly - he have us a complementary amuse bouche before our meal and shot at the end if the night.  The chef came out to see if we liked our meal (which we did).  The food was very good and reasonably priced for what I got.  From the Table d'hôte I had the duck confit with an appetizer dessert and coffee for $32.  Pasta dishes were less than $20.  The prior reviews appear to have been based on an older menu that had higher prices.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I was staying at the adjoining hotel for business and opted against going to a nearby café for a croissant and coffee for some silly reason. I thought since the hotel surpassed my expectations that the restaurant would too, but I was mistaken. The breakfast was really nothing special and so overpriced. $25 for average at best bagel lox and coffee is just not something I'm willing to do again. The service was prompt and courteous though. Next time I will hit up a café."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and not memorable. I did not have a bad experience, but I have no desire to come back again - even though I was staying in the hotel adjacent to the restaurant.The atmosphere and decor are a bit swanky and inviting, so a nice place to stop in for a quick drink.  I didn't like the red wine selection at all - no robust varieties."}
