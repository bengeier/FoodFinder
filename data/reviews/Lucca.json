{"text":"I planned a rehearsal dinner from Massachusetts via the phone and email with Monica. The afternoon of the rehearsal my husband and I stopped by Lucca Ristorante to check things out. I met the waitstaff who were already nicely setting the patio up for us and the evening manager Saurav, who assured us all would be perfect. Our party of 40 arrived almost all at once which seemed not to be a problem for the kitchen, waiters or bar.  We were treated very well and all thought the appetizers Crispy Prosciutto, Calamari, and Bruschetta were delicious. For a first course we had the Caprese salad, Arugula salad and Caesar which were all very fresh.  The meals of Tuscan Chicken, Veal Parmesean, Sea Scallops, and Fettucini, all came out with impeccable timing, hot, and again really yummy.  We kept the dessert simple with Rasberry Sorbet or Chocolate Gellato, which all were glad because the portions had been generous and we were all feeling full.  I can't say enough about the respectful service we recieved and how good the food was, as well as the price being fair.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will most definetely return to Lucca Ristorante and Wine Bar."}
{"text":"Went at 8 pm on a Thursday night and it was almost empty  when we got there.   The place looks nice but the host was wearing a Tshirt, which I thought was oddly casual.         While we were there, a large group came in and raised the energy level of the place.  Service was quick and friendly, and the food was good - perhaps a slight salty.     I probably wouldn;t seek it out, but would be happy to eat there again"}
{"text":"One of the best italian  meals I have had in a long time. The meal started with some very delicious bread and oil. Menu was a good mix of classic preperations along with some more interesting seasonal dishes. We started off with a house made loaded focaccia, and a watermelon gazpacho which was super refreshing and flavorful. For entre's we had scallops with figs and arugula and a house made tagliatelle  with pork sugo.  Everything was perfect. Service was great and the outdoor patio was the perfect dining environment. We will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth it.  First- the service was inexcusable.  The food was mediocre at best, and for the price we left extremely disappointed.  I am fairly sure that another table just got up and left in the middle of dinner.  I was really surprised at both the service and the food because it looks like a nice place and it is expensive.  I will never eat here again and I am super irritated that I wasted $80 on a crappy meal and crappy service.  I wish I could un-eat the meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Different and unique menu.   Everything my family ordered was delicious, including the appetizers, main course and desert.  The restaurant aims to please."}
{"text":"cozy  italian restaurant (read - tables VERY close)  SLOW service - but can't stop going tthere  excellent shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce  excellent carrot cake"}
{"text":"I save Lucca for special occasions since it is a bit pricey. I've found the food to be very good and recommend the calamari appetizer. I'm always amazed how they can prepare calamari to be so tender and tasty!  The atmosphere is high end and the service is very attentive."}
{"text":"Be a single woman customer at the bar before the arts and letters series and learn about poor and maybe gender biased service.  Terrible and dismissive service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bread was hard. The scallops had a lot of grit and very buttery. Not worth the $30 price. A lot of gnats flying around. Very dis-appointing."}
{"text":"Lucca is an extravagant Italian restaurant full of patrons celebrating something or other within its halls.  The service is very attentive and actually knows something about the wine list, a rarity in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is great! I recommend the focaccia appetizer, the house - made tagliatelle, and the zeppole for dessert. Also, David is an excellent waiter! Very attentive, friendly, and recommended great wine and food. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had Dinner at Lucca this evening. Very accommodating. Delicious and beautifully presented. All dietary issues addressed quietly and quickly. Can't wait to go back for another round. Three of us went on a whim. Now we have a new favorite eatery."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but not worth the prices.  And, I find it really annoying when a snobby restaurant serves nasty, undrinkable tap water. No, you're not going to squeeze more money out of me for a beverage so that your skanky water won't ruin my meal. And no, serving said water in a fancy cobalt blue glass doesn't make it taste any better."}
{"text":"Really nice environment and upscale atmosphere for a celebration or just a night out. When my dad and I walked in for a late lunch on a weekend, the host was a little curt, but our server was very friendly. We were seated at a table for two that was sectioned off by columns, which could make for a very intimate setting.  I had the Atlantic salmon, which came on a bed of steamed asparagus and spinach with a chive butter sauce. The menu said steamed rice instead of the spinach. I would have appreciated the carbs, especially since the portions are on the smaller side here, but I didn't mind the spinach either. The salmon was incredibly moist, possibly due to the fact that it was on the fattier side. The vegetables were fine, and the sauce was, well, buttery-tasting.  My dad ordered the grilled boneless chicken breast, which came on a bun, with fries and ketchup. (He also could've chosen salad or soup.) I tried some of his chicken, which was heavily (though not excessively) seasoned and tender. He seemed to enjoy it. The fries were crispy and pretty good, and I liked that they were seasoned with something other than salt. I'm not sure what it was.  I'm not itching to return, but I had a good experience."}
{"text":"Very good food but a little pricey so I dropped them back a star. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Cute place, but cute does not equal good food.  Wow! Probably one of the most inauthentic Italian restaurants I've ever been too. I was in town for business this past weekend and decided to try a local spot with colleagues. I am originally from Tuscany, but now line in NYC and let me tell you that this place was a disaster.  For starters the burrata was subpar and the vinegar was of the lowest quality. It totally ruined our dish.  The bistecca was fatty and totally inedible. The butternut squash ravioli was so gummy that my gums stuck together. The \"Scottish\"  salmone was also very fatty. A true foodie knows that wild salmon has barely any fat. The plating of the food looked like it came straight out of a restaurant from NYC's Little Italy. So insulting and misleading. This is not Tuscan cuisine, rather it's Italian American masquerading as Italian.   I guess that's what happens when you eat in an area where Dominos, Papa John's and Olive Garden are considered Italian restaurants.   Che peccato!"}
{"text":"Lucca is a fine Italian dining experience. Having lived in Italy for nearly 2 years of my life, I can say this place is the most authentic in Pittsburgh. Now if you want a menu with typical Americanized-Italian (Stromboli, calzone, Alfredo, etc), then Lucca will shock you. Yes they have a delicious steak on the menu. And yes, steak is very Italian (central Italy).   Fantastic appetizers (stracciatella cheese with olive tapenade was incredible), insalate mista was spot on, and for an entre I had swordfish with capers a lemon sauce, side of red sauce bolognese pasta. wow. So good.   Truly a 5-Star establishment."}
{"text":"Ambiance was very nice. Had the bruschetta for an app, good I do believe the bread was Texas toast though. Lamb chops were delicious perfectly cooked the accompanying mushroom risotto was a perfect side. My wife went with the tiger shrimp dish (I'm not going to try to spell it). Good but over priced. Nice size portions on everything. Not too much but didn't leave you hungry.  If you go which I would recommend at least once. Save room for dessert. The carrot cake is worth the trip and the bill!   P.S.  The service was some of the best I've experienced from the host to the wait staff. Extremely professional"}
{"text":"We went because with a Groupon. The reviews are mixed on Yelp so my expectations were tempered. They have a great covered patio outside on a level above the sidewalk which allows you to people-watch.   We shared two appetizers: Stracciatella di Bufalo: delicious. Buffalo mozzarella mixed with cream.  Wild mushroom risotto: this went fast so I couldn't get a proper photo. Pretty good.  For entrees, people got the Branzino and the Scallops special. I had the Fettuccine with mushrooms, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, feta. The balance of ingredients made for an unremarkable flavor. The pasta texture was excellent: thin and delicate.  For the non-veggie dishes, the Branzino and the Scallops were reportedly good but it came with a strange lentil pur√©e which had no real flavor.   Overall, there were a few highlights (buffalo cheese, fish preparation, and pasta quality) but there were inconsistencies between and even within the dishes. It's a nice restaurant with mediocre food."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant, So bad that it left me visibly upset. It started out a little rough, just a long wait and then our food wasn't quite right, so we informed our server who brought over the manager, a man named Surav. This is where things went bad. Surav was very clearly drunk, and not standard bar manger drunk, but could smell the liquor on his breath slurring his words drunk. He made a large fuss, and my wife and daughter were both rather uncomfortable with this clearly drunken man. My wife got frustrated after trying to explain the problem and his drunken self not getting what was wrong. He left after some fuss and replaced our meal, I thought that would be the end of it, but no. As i was coming back from the bathroom I heard him make several incredibly rude comments, referring to my wife as \"A b***h\" and saying she \"must be like that because she wasn't getting enough D***\" I was horrified and absolutely livid, I listened as he went on to make a few incredibly lewd comments about my daughter (who is 17 by the way mind you) , and saying several just disgusting sexual things. I was furious, we payed our tab and left I wish I had confronted him but I didn't. For someone in a restaurant to conduct themselves like this is disgraceful, and whoever actually runs this place should be ashamed of themselves for even employing someone who acts like Surav. The food was great once they fixed the issue, but completely overshadowed by the drunken, rude, and vile manager."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary and had an awful experience. The waiter ignored us for the majority of the night while he was making drinks at the bar and another employee stood there watching him. It was not a busy time there were less than 10 people in the entire restaurant. My spaghetti tasted exactly like spaghetti-O's so if you're interested in $18 Chef Boyardee this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Fancy, expensive, overpriced. I only go here when one of the vendors I work with treats me to lunch. Otherwise I just couldn't be tempted because of the price.   I have had delicious quiche here, but it was pretty standard as far as quiche goes and nothing to write home about. Everything I saw on the menu was just so expensive, and I didn't see any wow factors in terms of what they serve. The nice part about going with a big group is that you see a lot of different items at once, but everything looked pretty average. Not a ton of option for vegetarians outside of salads, but they serve pastas, so you could probably ask for something special.    In terms of ambiance, it is upscale and masculine, with darkly hued, well appointed furniture and decor. The dining areas are comfortable and clean. There is a wonderful outdoor seating area that has a large awning, when temperature permits."}
{"text":"I went here with a promotional special from the Opera Theatre SummerFest Pittsburgh and got the ravioli special. This was right before closing time, and just before I went to Batavia NY for the evening. I was also waiting for a AAA employee to help out with my possible tire problem for my rental car. This was a very hospitable place, even though I was coming in so late. The entrance may be rather difficult to locate for those not used to the area, but it definitely lends the whole place an intimate feel."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it wasn't busy at all. The portions were tiny, and service was super slow. The server also had an unpleasant attitude. The biggest reason why I'm only giving one star is because I witnessed the server dropping something from my Risotto as she was bringing it over. But instead of apologizing, she picked it up and hid it behind her back. Even though I witnessed her doing this, I didn't say anything because I wasn't 100% sure if it was food that she dropped on the floor. But my suspicions were confirmed when I saw that the table next to us ordered the same risotto and had more content that my plate was missing. Overall, not worth the price nor the quality of service nor the time."}
{"text":"If you havent been here yet, I totally recommend it. It's super classy and intimate. If your in collage, it's a great place to take your parents to when they visit and it's close to campus. If you are living on the cheap, go for the lunch. It's cheaper than union grill. Ask for the Costa pasta."}
{"text":"Food was poor to mediocre. My husband's pasta was fair. I had the butternut squash ravioli which was nothing like the description. It was tasteless cheese ravioli  in a thick butternut squash sauce. Absolutely awful. Waiter never came to check on us after meal was served. No water refreshed. Wine list terrible. No ambiance."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! I went here for lunch with my mentally disabled client. We planned to use a bogo coupon from the Entertainment Book (or Enjoy...can't remember for sure). We showed the coupon to the waiter and asked if we could use it on salads (since we wanted a light lunch and these were plate size salads). We were told yes. However, after we ate the waiter refused to honor what he had told us. He apologized and stated that the manager said we could not use the coupon since the salad we ordered did not have meat on it. I asked to speak to a manager. I tried to explain to the manager that we had specifically asked about the coupon before ordering and that my companion had limited funds. He became very angry and raised his voice at us. People began to stare which made both of us feel very awkward. I then asked (very politely I might add, because I was working and not allowed to lose my temper) that they charge us for a salad with meat at the bogo price, even though we did not receive meat. This suggestion really seemed to enrage him and so I quickly said nevermind and please just have the waiter return with the bill (which he had taken with him when he went to find the manager). The waiter never returned with our bill. We sat there (my client very visibly shaken with tears in her eyes as she does not handle confrontation like this well) for over five minutes before getting up and going to the podium where people enter in hopes of being able to pay our bill. My client was so upset I had to write an incident report! Maybe the manager was just having a bad day, but it was extremely inappropriate behavior. I should state that this happened a year ago, so this man may no longer work here. What a shame though, because I actually really liked the restaurants atmosphere and, though pricey, the food was good :("}
{"text":"The food was delicious with a nice ambiance and good service.  We had the mixed olive appetizer and salad.  Bailee had spaghetti and said it was delicious...she even ate the meatballs. I had the grouper special that was very good.  Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for years!! After we saw a show in town we decided to stop here for dinner.  The mushroom and Brie soup was delicious. Hubby had the lamb and I had the pumpkin ravioli with mascarpone topped with toasted hazelnut. It's not cheap, but the food is oh so worth it. The one thing I would change is better lighting so the menu is easier to read. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here. The service was fantastic, and the food outstanding. My wife had the Mar de Frutti and it is the best shrimp dish she has ever eaten (and she has eaten many). The atmosphere was very intimate and cozy. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Lucca is delicious. The menu isn't extensive but the dishes are well done. I recently had the gnocchi with scallops and loved it. My fianc√© is a fan of the veal. This is our go to place for good Italian food. Love that they have homemade pasta!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service and a beautiful setting. The best fresh seafood I've had in Oakland. Our waiter took great care of us, even bringing out the daily special for us to see before we ordered. The weather was nice so we got to sit outside under the awning. A delicious, leisurely dinner we will definitely be enjoying again soon."}
{"text":"Thought this place was great. Calamari appetizer was delicious, as were each of the pasta dishes we ordered. Also got 2 desserts and both were amazing. Service was fast and friendly. Highly recommended, especially for dates."}
{"text":"Found Lucca on Groupon and figured we'd give it a try.  We went on a Saturday night and sat at the bar.  The bar itself is small, and the bartender acted as if he would have rather been at the dentist having a root canal then working that night.  We started with the wedge salad and it was fresh, but nothing special. The spaghetti and meatballs, was rather bland, and lacked flavor.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sauce had that metal taste, as if it came straight from the can.  The meatballs themselves (2) were ok, but lacked flavor.   The bartender never once came over to see how our meal was, and in fact we never saw him again until we were finished and ready for the bill.   Lucca does have nice ambiance, and is dimly lit.  Parking can be difficult, and you may have to park a few blocks away.   We would return with another Groupon, but not if paying full price."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon is great but it is a little bit expensive. The waiter is not warm enough. The waiting time is a little bit long. Still, a nice and romantic place."}
{"text":"I had a delicious pumpkin ravioli here this week. I often shy away from things that are too sweet (candies, aside) and I finished this dish without a tummy ache. Just sweet enough and filling; looked great on the plate. The decor was a bit outdated, but I didn't mind too much. Definitely a little pricey. I'd try this place again!"}
{"text":"The food was good for a lunch. I had my taste buds set on something they didn't serve until dinner but I made it work."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Took my son and his Pitt roommate there for dinner. My son had the Bistec and said it was the best meal he ever had. Loved the sticky toffee pudding to wrap up a great experience."}
{"text":"They have another location at North End, Boston. Love the food here"}
{"text":"Had a poor experience at this place. Two of our entrees were so salty it was hard to stomach.  They charge $14 a glass for house wines and the pours are too light. A bowl of soup is $7 and the \"bowl\" is more like a plate it is so shallow and I had 2 bones in my soup. Absolutely nothing is included with the over priced entrees. I opted to add scallops to my fettuccine an the gave me 2! That's right 2! The service was terrible. It took us 20 minutes to get our drinks and we only got 3 out of 4 and he had to wait another 5 minutes. When our meals came,  the first 2 of 4 came and the other two took nearly another ten minutes to come out. All said and done $224 for 4 of us to eat at this place after tip.  I would not mind this, but the best part of the meal was the over priced wine.  Terrible, we will never go back and will be tell others the same.  Wanna be upscale place that is really bad. I mentioned our dissatisfaction at the end of the meal and there was a light apology and no other service recovery was offered."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere.   Definitely a must go. Good cocktails.  Friendly servers.   All around a pleasurable place to visit"}
{"text":"Good food, nice selections.  They could do so much better with their wine list....surprised that an executive chef has not done more to choose some nice pairings.  In addition, wines were a bit expensive for the selections offered.  Staff, manager, and bartender were not knowledgeable.  A good sommelier would be a worthy investment.  Overall, expensive for the average experience."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times, mainly for a business lunch since it appears to be the only restaurant around that area to offer such an environment.  The atmosphere when you enter is nice and it also has a nice outdoor patio for the summer.  However, the quality of the food is not as expected.  To be more precise, the value for money is not good.  While the food is decent, with fair entrees and a fairly good variety, the place is overpriced.  I would assume that this is due to the lack of other alternatives around for similar occasions, but in general I try to avoid this place for that reason.  Again, not that I do not enjoy the food and atmosphere when I go, but it is nothing spectacular to justify the prices."}
{"text":"First and foremost the food was very good. The reason why I give this a 2 star review was because how we were treated. Before going to the Phipps winter garden with my date we decided we would get a good bite to eat. It was about 6:00 PM and we walked into Lucca. The place was empty with only two tables occupied. I was asked if I had reservations and I said no. The host gave me this look like are you kidding me? And starts shuffling through the papers on the host stand and goes \"well I guess we could seat you here\" and by here, it was the worst seat in the restaurant right in the front. The waitress came over and she was nice but where I was sat in the restaurant every time someone came in I would be bumped. Was very annoying. We order two of the most expensive meals on the menu and I have to say they were good. We finished up our meal and the by the time we were done a total of 4 tables were occupied. I just didn't like the guys attitude. Probably won't ever go back which is a shame because it was good. Sucks to suck I guess..."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing as was the atmosphere. I came on a cool, windy night with a friend, and the feel of eating outdoors along with the high-class Italian food created a very European atmosphere which I loved. The dinner was wonderful, and everything was well made with fresh ingredients. I had the Linguine, and my friend had the Papparadelle. I thought the Linguine delicious with well-made pesto, and it avoided being too unctuous thanks to the salmon. We had the Italian Lemon Torte for desert, and it was wonderfully light and refreshing after the dinner. The vanilla oil was rich but not heavy and full of flavor. The berry glaze helped give it a tarty taste which helped lighten it up. The whole dinner was just incredible.  My only gripe is with the price, but honestly, I think the atmosphere and the food combined are worth the price. I won't go back for a while because I do believe the price is a bit prohibitive, but if I had the resources, this would be one of my staple restaurants to enjoy for a night out."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner at the recommendation of a friend (and with a groupon). Our group was seated outside with a lovely view of Craig. The perfect weather and calm atmosphere definitely enhanced our experience. The service was prompt and accommodating.   Between the four of us, we tried a few starters including the caprese buffalo mozerella and the mushroom risotto which we asked to be served as an appetizer. The risotto was delicious! I would definitely order it again as a meal. My entree (scallops) was a chalkboard special for the day. Overall really good, and beautifully presented. My one critique is the lentil pur√©e was a little funky in color and taste, although I'm not the biggest lentil fan to begin with. My boyfriend had the sea bass Branzino Striato which he really enjoyed. Overall great experience, will defiantly come back for lunch or a relaxing evening meal."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last month. Went to a work dinner and had the braised rib special which was very good.   Also had the brussel sprouts appetizer, which was phenomenal.  This past week went to a special event in their back room. 3-course meal. The pasta with meatball was pretty good. Really enjoyed the dessert though - the caramel gelato was excellent. Would recommend the back room for small group functions (10-20 people)"}
{"text":"Lucca is a favorite when visiting Pittsburgh. I like their approach to Italian-American cooking. The menu at Lucca changes frequently, so one is sure to find something new among the entrees or the salads. I liked the Spinach Salad on my first visit, but have not seen it listed since. After trying the Cesar salad and the Chopped Salad on different visits, I will stay with the Chopped Salad for now. A tasty appetizer for sharing is the Fritto Misto, combining oysters, shrimp and calamari. (Better than calamari alone!) For an entree, I select a pasta dish. Each of the pastas comes with its own signature accompaniment. I've tried the Tagliatelli and Rigatoni (both with braised pork sugo), Risotto ai Vitello e Pepe (with veal and a trio of peppers), and Alla Chitara (with meatballs). The latter is a spaghetti-like pasta, but is hollow. I've enjoyed them all, but I suppose my favorite is the braised pork sugo. Portions are ample, so here will be some to take home for later.  The interior of Lucca is very attractive. It is dark in the evening, but lit with a variety of stained glass panels. The only downside to Lucca is that seating is very snug. Someone always seems to be bumping into my chair no matter where I sit.   Parking can be a challenge, but I am usually able to find a spot on Fillmore Street, down from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I heard Lucca had hired a new Chef and have been there twice since in the last few weeks, once for lunch and once for dinner. Let's get this out of the way first: Lucca is pricey.  I got their burger at lunch and it was really well seasoned and perfectly cooked. It's really up there for me for beat burgers I've had in Pittsburgh. They added some crispy prosciutto and that was a nice touch, but the burger itself was a star. As for the fries I (sadly but wisely) opted out. The salad was small, but light. The burger was more than enough for me.  And for dinner I devoured a gnocchi dish with 2 large scallops in a butternut squash sauce for dinner and it was perfectly executed. Maybe I'm just really easy to please but gnocchi and scallops are both a little bit of a challenge to get right.  Lucca is also doing brunch now and I'd love to come back to try it out. I think they're really trying to compete now that the more laid back Union has remodeled and foodie darling Legume is up the street, and honestly they should be competitive! Lucca has the best outdoor seating on the street, so they get points for that.  To many Pitt and CMU grads it might remain the place that was too expensive for them to even look at the menu. However to those alumni: if you're not overburdened by student debt (TBH a small population), you should give Lucca a chance."}
{"text":"I live approximately two blocks from Lucca, and have walked by it about a gazillion times.  Given that my friends and I had plans to head to Phipps on Sat. evening, and that they wanted to have dinner somewhere on Craig St., I suggested it, given that it's one of the few upscale options.  As you can see by my rating, unfortunately, our visit left something to be desired.  The main issue was the service.  From the time we sat down, it was clear that serving us was not a priority.  After 10 min., the waiter came to take our drink orders, and then brought them out in another 5 min.  However, after that, we sat for about 15 min. with no sign of him coming back to take our food orders.  I finally went up to the hostess stand and demanded service, which was followed by him coming over to take our order in short order.  For our appetizer, we ordered the terra stracchiatella de bufula ($15), which consisted of fresh mozzarella, crispy prosciutto, and fig jam.  We also ordered the crispy calamari ($11), which comes with red peppers, onion, and spicy tomato basil sauce.  While the crispy prosciutto was good, the fresh mozzarella was more watery than I'd like.  I'm not a huge calamari fan, so I'm not the most objective judge of calamari, but it wasn't as crispy as I'd like, and I wasn't a fan of the spicy elements--though I get that they were included to add flavor.  For our entrees, we ordered the following from the pasta menu: tagliatelle ($18), braised rabbit risotto ($14), and wild mushroom risotto ($12).  The tagliatelle was quite al dente, to the point that my friend who ordered it was wondering if it was cooked properly.  He became accustomed to it eventually, and enjoyed it after that.  I can't speak for the braised rabbit risotto, as I didn't try it.  However, I can speak for the wild mushroom risotto, which I ordered, and it was severely underseasoned.  Because our table didn't have salt and pepper shakers, I (miraculously) caught our waiter's attention when he was waiting on the table next to us and asked for some.  The addition of salt and pepper greatly improved the dish--even then, though, it was 3.5 star quality at best.  As expected, when finished our dinner, we sat for a good 10-15 min. waiting for the check.  Fed up with waiting at this point, I got up and approached the bar, where our waiter was working, and firmly requested the check.  It was at this point when I realized that our waiter was actually the bartender, and that the restaurant was understaffed.  Out of goodwill, we tipped 15%--needless to say, the actual deserved tip was much less.  In his defense, he did make a delicious French 75--though, not to sound like a cocktail snob, but it was served in a martini glass instead of the proper highball glass.  For those keeping track at home, we spent 1.5 hours from arrival to departure.  Needless to say, we were less than impressed, and won't be returning until they up the ante with the food and get the service under control, esp. at this price point."}
{"text":"Food is nothing to write home about, but reasonably fresh and well prepared, and the service and ambience are the best on this section of Craig."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I find myself thinking \"hey, let's give Lucca another try.\"   And I always leave confirming my feeling that it's not very interesting or particularly tasty food served by officious staff at inappropriately upscale prices.   There are better -- and less expensive -- places to find Italian food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp because we were craving homemade-feel Italian food; and this place did not disappoint! I ordered the seafood pasta: there were crab, shrimp, and scallops; the sauce was light and tasty. My coworkers were super jealous when I reheated it for lunch the next day! My SO ordered the spaghettini and meatball dish: the meatballs were huge and tasted homemade!  The service and atmosphere were great and they had a cute patio to eat on as well!  I will definitely be back when craving Italian!"}
{"text":"Great little place with high quality ingredients and attentive staff.  Menu is a bit limited so check before if you have any picky eaters."}
{"text":"Very disappointed- I so wanted to like this place... started off good, appetizers were good and came out quickly but went downhill from there when not all of our salads came out and the waiter was in a spiral... finally got the salads and they were good. The entries were under cooked and not hot and had to go back... instead of remaking them and presenting them the way they should have been- they were simply thrown into a pan and all tossed together to get hot and then served.  The staff was accommodating and tried to make up for the error by bring out one lava cake with 6 yes 6 spoons. And guess what - the lava cake had no lava as it was over cooked and hard.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my rating is really 3.5, but there just isn't enough at Lucca to warrant rounding up to 4 stars. The restaurant is small and crowded, but not in the way of quaint New York Italian restaurants. The menu is relatively limited with just a few pasta, fish, and meat choices. The only thing we tried were two entres, the linguine with shrimp and the Norwegian cod. Both were good. The wine list is a very strong feature, with a good variety of domestic and foreign choices at extremely attractive prices. The food prices are also reasonable. Service was prompt and professional from the Oakland-required college student. Overall it was a pretty decent experience, but without notable, compelling reasons to return. Dining on the porch is a plus in the warm spring and fall months."}
{"text":"I love this place and am surprised it doesn't get more attention. I've been 10+ times - mostly recently, four of us came for dinner last night. I almost always make a reservation and it's easy to do online. The restaurant is cozy and intimate and in warm weather like last night, you can dine on the patio which is definitely a plus. The best part is the food, as I have never had a less-than-fantastic meal here.   To start, they bring fresh crusty bread with balsamic and olive oil. Last night, we ordered the calamari and buffalo mozzerella/caprese appetizers, both which were perfect sizes for sharing among four people. The menu has a nice variety but the seafood and pasta are the real standouts. For entrees, we ordered the frutti di mare pasta, salmon, gnocchi, and veal risotto. I tried the first three - all were divine. The spicy tomato cream with lump crab mixed in on the frutti di mare is one of my absolute favorite pasta sauces and if you like scallops, the ones at Lucca are always perfectly cooked and fresh. On previous trips, I've also tried their daily ravioli, seafood mixed grill, and mushroom risotto and all were great. We also ordered the lemon semifreddo and the chocolate cake and highly recommend both. Prices are reasonable, especially for the quality and amount of food. I've also always had great service, even on busier nights."}
{"text":"overpriced. the food is just ok. the tables don't look very clean. some staff are nice, but some seem to have attitude. it could have been better for this price. a good candidate for Ramsay to come fix."}
{"text":"Good food, but not great - especialy considering how much you pay for it. Atmosphere is definately good for celebrations."}
{"text":"I have been to Lucca only for lunch. It is always a wonderful afternoon. Great atmosphere and I have always enjoyed the relaxing visit with friends. The food is fantastic - Authentic Italian. I would highly recommend any of the pasta dishes. Their menu does change, but your sure to find any dish well worth the visit. I am always disappointed when a restaurant doesn't add the wine list to their website. Lucca has a well balances list that will complement any food choice. I am more of a white wine drinker. The Spaghettini or the Fettuccine with a good Chardonnay would make an excellent choice. I like any of the salads with added chicken.  They do have a great list if your someone who enjoys a glass or bottle with your meal.   I have had no issues with the service. I have always been treated with prompt, friendly service. Lucca does offer discounts when you can find them. I think the prices are reasonable for the location and the quality of food received."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Lucca's a couple times however this past time I went I really wasn't impressed. I actually didn't even like my entree. My husband & I split a spring mix salad which was ok nothing special & the truffle fries which were awesome. The fries w/ the truffle sauce were the best part of the whole meal. They also bring out fresh bread with olive oil & balsamic vinegar, which was good. The downside is they do not have a very big vegetarian selection. When I went there was only 2 vegetarian entree options. My first choice was the gnocchi pasta but they were out of gnocchi so I was forced to get the only other vegetarian entree on the menu, pasta w/ vegetables in olive oil. I did not like it at all. I couldn't even finish it. It had hardly any flavor and there was so much oil it made me sick. I was really disappointed b/c I have had good pasta there before. I guess they're really hit or miss unfortunately. I may go back but it'll be a while, not my first choice."}
{"text":"I was treated to dinner and dessert here, both of which were sublime. Although I was tempted to stuff myself full with Lucca's amazing pre-dinner breads+olive oil, I managed to control myself and of that I am very proud. I ordered the Seafood Mix Grill (delicious, but would have ordered their signature Frutti di Mare con Penne if it didn't have a cream sauce and I wasn't lactose intolerant) and two of their three desserts (get the White Chocolate Fruit Tart, the Chocolate Lava Cake is nowhere near as satisfying). The staff was pleasant, the atmosphere suave. Perhaps not worth the $30+ per entree, but should you have a bit of extra pocket money, certainly not the worst investment one could make."}
{"text":"Their outdoor seating is perfect for the summer, I'd try to get a table out there if at all possible.  Our waiter was really friendly, attentive without being overboard.  I ordered the Mafalda, which I would DEFINITELY recommend.  It was thick, almost lasagna-type pasta (though not as thick) with mushrooms, artichokes, plum tomatoes, greens and feta.  It was AMAZING, the mushrooms are artichokes really added a great flavor -- and in my opinion, you can't go wrong with feta.    My boyfriend got the linguine, which had Atlantic salmon, diced tomatoes, spinach and pesto sauce.  The salmon was good, but the rest was kind of lackluster -- plus the pesto sauce was more of a soup type consistency.  I prefer pesto sauce to be a little bit thicker.. they may have gone a little thick on the olive oil.    But definitely recommended - especially on a summer night, I loved watching the foot traffic go by while we ate."}
{"text":"I'd walked by Lucca for YEARS before finally deciding to pull the trigger and dine here (as part of my eternal quest for delicious Italian food).  I had an Enjoy book coupon so I figured, why not?  I love this restaurant and if you haven't dined here, you've got to try it out!  I've been to Lucca for relaxed dinner with friends, business meetings, and romantic dates and somehow Lucca has the right atmosphere for all three occasions.  If you come here in the summer, they have a really nice patio.  If you're eating inside, its still got a really nice ambiance.    The food is excellent and I do not even care if I look foolish when I flip out over the meatballs the way I do.  Oh my god they are so good.  I recommend the ravioli, and the pizza!  I've never had a bad meal here.  Holy crap the scallops... they are soo very good!    Lucca is not the cheapest place you can dine, but it's not dreadfully expensive and I've actually paid a lot more for food that was nowhere near as good."}
{"text":"went  to  lucca  as  a  party  of  2  for  a  business  lunch  on  thanksgiving  friday. the  pasta  main  course  --for  $16 -- consisted  of  5  very  small  shrimp  in a  good    sauce. this would  have   made  a  great  serving  for  a  3rd  grader ,  but  adults  need  twice  the  quantity  than  this  restaurant  gives  you. this  is  about the  3rd  time  i've  been  disappointed  in  the  quantity  of  food  for  the  pricey  price  they  charge. i  won't  take   guests  here,  and  i  won't  be  back  myself if  i  am  the  one  in  charge  of  reservations...)   i  might  add  that  the  woman  who  seated  us  was  rather  cool  and  not  very  pleasant  or welcoming  ---even  though  by  1:15  the  restaurant  was  nearly  empty of  diners."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our night at Lucca. The calamari,brussel  sprouts and burrata were all great apps. Spinach salad was just OK.  Seafood pasta, bronzino special and rissotos were all well done. The service was also great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pasta ever!! Everything was made fresh not frozen . Staff was great ! Would definitely go there again. The restaurant was old world quiet and dark loved it!!!"}
{"text":"overpriced california/italian food.  Small portions.  Lunch service is slow.  Don't expect to be out of there in an hour.  Patio in the summer is a good place for a leisurely $20 lunch.   Decent place to take a visitor if you on an expense account."}
{"text":"The quality of food at this place is unbelievably low. Simple dishes like Pasta are made so untasty, full of oil, and lack any creative cooking touch.  In such a great location with an outdoor seating, they could become a very popular restaurant if they offered better food."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved everything!  We were greeted and seated by a very friendly host.  Our server, Jackson, was perfect.  He suggested a great wine, and we also took his food recommendations.  My husband had the mixed medley of shrimp, salmon and scallops.   I had the blue crab ravioli.  Both were delicious!!!   If we're ever in Pittsburg again, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. It is very cozy inside but can get a bit loud. We eat out a lot and this is the first time we've seen each server responsible for making their own drinks. This created quite a few issues: one server was in the middle of a complicated drink for someone at the bar and left to serve food then came back a few minutes later and wasn't sure where she was in the process; there was a long delay in getting drinks; and at one point there were 3 servers behind a small bar stumbling around each other. Our server who was also the manager for the night did not know how to pour wine and was very inattentive.  Our food was extremely slow coming out of the kitchen with no comment by the server/manager. When we asked about an appetizer that came out cold instead of apologizing the manager/server was defensive and inappropriate. There was no-one bussing tables so plates and empty glasses were left on table and water not refilled quickly. All of our dishes were delicious but given how poorly the restaurant is managed we will not likely return."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! Always delicious and always a great atmosphere! We especially love eating on the porch on a warm summer night. Our entire family orders the same dish -- frutti di mare with huge shrimp! It is delicious!! Well worth the price!  We have taken many friends here and they always love it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Lucca hoping to find a quality Italian restaurant to frequent when her father and I come for visits while she's at U-PITT for the next four years.  We made a reservation for 6:30 on a Saturday night, arrived a little early at 6:15.  We were seated promptly, but coldly, by the \"host\" on duty; the restaurant was mostly empty.  After being seated and ordering drinks, my Pinot Grigio came in a dirty glass covered with food remnants.  This was corrected after sending it back, no big deal to me as this can happen.  The waiter, the same man who seated us, never bothered to tell us about specials or speak to us at all except to ask what we wanted to order.  Actually when I asked what the specials were he told me what the soup was.  The bruschetta appetizer was very flavorful, but on the menu it was to be crusty, it was very soft, but excellent flavor.  I asked the waiter's recommendation between the Fettuccine and the Linguini, he was certain the linguini was better.  It came out over cooked and very bland.  My daughter's gnocchi was great.  Being Italian, flavor is very important, if I need to add spice, it's no good.  I could not eat it.  The waiter finally came around after about an hour wait to see if we wanted boxes.  I said no, my daughter said yes and we ordered dessert to go.  When we got back to the hotel, no Gnocchi!  The chocolate lava cake was not heated and was just not good, my daughter's lemon tort was freezer burned, and hardly tasted of lemon, but the cake consistency was good.  We chose this restaurant based on location and decent prior reviews.  The food being hit and miss was one thing, but a horrid, uncaring waiter is unacceptable.  Other waiters seemed great and other customers seemed happy.  I usually tip over 25% having, waited tables in college, even for mediocre service.  I still gave an undeserved 10%, but looking back wish I'd have left nothing. This person needs training or to be let go, along with the dish washers and management.  After sending a dirty glass back someone should come apologize, after not being able to eat a meal, yet paid for it, management should have sprung into action.  Very sad to give a bad review, I was expecting so much better."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Thursdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had both been past Lucca many times before but somehow had never made it inside.  However whenever we found out that it was in the coupon books (Enjoy/Entertainment) we decided to head there on our date night.  I made reservations on OpenTable for 7 PM and we arrived to the restaurant right around that time and were immediately seated.  They put us in what I originally thought was a weird location as it was a somewhat secluded two top in the \"bar area\".  The longer that we were there the more I appreciated it though as I actually enjoyed being somewhat secluded from the rest of the restaurant.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start out by splitting the fritto misto and then for my entree I went with the fettuccine.  Our appetizer came out first and consisted of fried oysters, shrimp, calamari, asparagus and peppers with a lemon aioli.  The breading on all of it was nice and allowed you to enjoy the flavor of the seafood and vegetables inside.  I also enjoyed the lightness of the aioli which made a great dipping sauce for all of it.  After we had finished that our entrees came out and my fettuccine consisted of hand rolled fettuccine with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, greens, artichokes,  pine nuts and feta.  If the menu hadn't said that the pasta was hand rolled I wouldn't have been able to tell you that.  Still the pasta was cooked nicely and I appreciated all of the ingredients that were in it especially the sun dried tomatoes and artichokes each which brought their own acidity to the dish.  Overall it was a solid dish and my wife enjoyed her pasta as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I am not sure why neither my wife nor I have visited Lucca before but we both enjoyed our experience and food on this visit."}
{"text":"Oakland was hopping on a Friday night so I decided to give Lucca a shot for a quick happy hour drink before heading to an event.   My friend and I got a two top table near the bar and ordered the cheese plate and two glasses of wine.  I don't believe they had any drink specials, but the prices were reasonable. The cheese plate was a nice snack to accompany the wine.  Small bar area that was full, a medium sized dining room, and when the weather is nice you can sit at their outdoor patio.  For the area this is a more upscale restaurant and you can expect to pay a little more than you would at the surrounding eateries.  But you can expect a much more quality meal and service."}
{"text":"One of the better Italian restaurants in the city, and one of the nicest restaurants in Oakland, Lucca would be a fantastic choice at a lower price point.  The food is well prepared; the staff is usually friendly and helpful; and the ambiance is nice without being stuffy.  But the pricing for this experience is more appropriate for a city like New York or San Francisco."}
{"text":"Dear Husband and I made a same-day weekend reservation for a nice dinner out. We parked a few streets away and walked to the restaurant. Service was prompt. We didn't really like the wine I had chosen (a Spanish rose), but that's not Lucca's fault. The Neal began with warm bread and olive oil. My duck breast was okay--although I agreed to take it medium, after trying it, I really would have preferred well done. The vegetables on the side were savory and delicious. DH opted for the spaghetti and meatballs and was not particularly impressed. However, he did think the spiced chocolate mousse we shared was the best thing he ate all night. I agree it was good. We left full but not stuffed, without leftovers, so it was a little surprising to receive a bill for more than $30 per person (more than $40 with tip). Not sure the food and experience were worth that."}
{"text":"Good food, but not much to write home about. Went here on a date, fairly personal and romantic ambience."}
{"text":"Ok - we were a party of 12 - having been a server in the past, I get how that can be, etc... but we got there early on a weekday night and the restaurant was empty. Literally had THE WORST server. Tall guy who rolled his eyes, never brought ANYTHING - we had to ask for bread, water, drinks, when to order, etc... you had ONE table guy? It was an office party, so of course none of us were rude. The food was OK, but definitely not worth the cost. Like 10 dollars for some olives and bread... seriously? Don't waste your money coming here. The staff and food are a joke."}
{"text":"I've been here twice myself for lunch and have scheduled business dinners here on two other occasions.   The food is fantastic - I highly suggest any of the pasta dishes. They do a fantastic job of balancing their dishes to not make them too heavy. Keep in mind that their menu changes. I wouldn't say that it's \"seasonal\" because it doesn't work to cater to seasonal vegetables or anything of the same. However, they do take dishes off and put new ones on, so don't be surprised if you view an old menu somewhere online or if you return and the dish you loved the last time isn't there any more. (I promise you that you will find something else JUST as delicious!)   While this isn't really a beer sort of place and you'd most likely order wine with the dishes, if you ARE a beer drinker (you probably are if you're in Pittsburgh...) the beer selection is odd. Dogfishhead 60 min IPA, Hoegarten, and Peroni - that's it. I haven't tried the cocktails, so I can't speak to that.  Someone below mentioned the service as to why they gave such low stars. I've never been impressed with the service, but they're not horrible. I think it's just a little odd at the not top notch service for such a nice restaurant, but don't let that keep you from coming. Just keep it in mind where you do!"}
{"text":"I had a Valentine's dinner here, and it was pretty much the atmosphere that made the meal for me. The food definitely wasn't bad, but for the price it definitely wasn't the most amazing Italian food I'd ever had. Like I said, very nice atmosphere, very cozy and classic feeling."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Excellent filet and appetizers across the board."}
{"text":"Delicious truffle fries. Nice decor to get away from hustle of campus area and enjoy some fine dining in Pittsburgh. The calamari were well prepared, not heavily crusted or greasy."}
{"text":"I rally like Lucca and have visited a few times now.  I was just enjoying a great meal with my family last night.  The dishes that we tried last night and the ones that I've tried in the past have always been good.  The presentation is top notch and the atmosphere inside and outside on the patios is quite nice.    If I was to grip about anything, it would be the portion size for what an average entree costs . I can forgive that for a place that is extremely high end, but Lucca is not that.  It does prevent me for dining with them more than I do.    My next grip would be the wine list and costs.  I dont expect the world for nothing but I generally start to question buying any wine with dinner with the bottle that I buy are on the menu for 3x and 4x what they liquor store pricing is.  You generally expect at least 2x, but they really stretch it here.  We enjoy our dinners without a bottle for that reason.  Even with my two gripes, I would still highly recommend Lucca.  Nice meal, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner at Lucca with my family and friends. The restaurant is very quiet and comfortable. The service is attentive and professional. I had the gnocchi which was absolutely amazing but tried all of the other dishes which were equally delicious.  Originally a Pittsburgher and having moved to San Francisco, this restaurant rivals the Italian food establishments in my new home."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Pittsburgh area.  The food was very spicy and bland, the service was subpar for any establishment.  Overall this was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I have always had wonderful food at this restaurant. Everything from steak to seafood has been wonderful! Most recently I had fruitti di mare and I was more than pleased! In the past, I have ordered steak, and it was perfectly cooked! I also recommend trying the fig bread with gelato, it is so much better than it sounds! I have never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"The food here was fine with a nice wine selection. However, our group was seated in the back room and there was no air conditioning. It was *incredibly* warm. Uncomfortably so. We spoke with the waiter, but nothing ever changed. It was a relief to leave this establishment!  Will not return."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time dining at Lucca. However, the only reason I'm giving them four stars is because one of the people at my table didn't enjoy his meal.   We had the Brussel sprout appetizer which was so tasty. I honestly wasn't expecting it to be so good. I had the risotto with braised short rib and it was absolutely delicious. The short rib was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor. For dessert, I had the lave cake with ice cream. While the cake was not anything special the homemade gelato was amazing."}
{"text":"Meh... overpriced and service is just so so. The decor and seating is nice and plush though, but I guess that's what you're paying for. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I went because I live in Oakland and I wanted decent Italian pasta. The meal which I ordered was fettuccine with housemade meat sauce and I wasn't impressed enough to pay $18 for it. Definitely over priced.The service was quick- I was in and out in no time but the service wasn't that great. I don't plan on going again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the worst service I've ever had. Ordered the steak medium rare- and it was well done... We should have sent the halibut back too because it was soooo over cooked... But my boyfriend was hungry and we didn't want to send back two entrees... Our server didn't apologize and gave us a bitter response when he took the $36 steak away... And he then became non existent. We are pretty easy going and low maintenance... But come on... These are BASICS.. He Never checked on us after that to see if this steak was correct. It Took another 20 mins for the remake the steak- and it was good But had no seasoning and was pretty bland... he dropped our check with out asking if we'd like anything else or saying anything at all.. we asked about dessert and he just said \" our kitchen is closed\" and walked away... it was a few mins before 9pm... Had our steak not been wrong we could have ordered dessert... Or at least communicate to us that your kitchen will Be closing... What kitchen closes at 9 on a Saturday and doesn't still have the dessert service available..... We had a groupon for $60 for $100... When he took the bill he had a smug smile on his face when he walked away  due to the groupon and that was it for him- my boyfriend and I both work as severs... Always tip well..we should not have tipped at all.. But couldn't be that equally as shitty as him by doing so. I wanted to leave a tip for the host- he was great- he ended up being our \"server\" that checked on us and apologized for the mishap.... because our server must have been in the back spanking it or something...again, we walked in with high hopes and planned on tipping on $128 even though we had the groupon deal...  Advice to the management... Clearly your servers don't care and they're ruining the reputation of this business... We will definitely not return and will spend our money where it's appreciated."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh just for the night, found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a shot. I ended up having the best meal ever! Our waiter Paul was great, even offering tips of places to check out during my stay. We had the truffle fries, salads, Gnocchi and Rigatoni and the most delicious tiramisu and chocolate lava cake with chocolate gelato. The meal was very reasonably priced considering the quantity of food and level of service."}
{"text":"Convenient location to CMU, Pitt, and the Museum, and gluten-free friendly. Pastas were very good even if the chef favors al dente more so than any other restaurant in the area. Everything put on the table was really good, including some of the more unusual pasta sauces.   Oddly the wine by the glass menu was void of Italian reds.  Service a bit slow, but I left with the feeling that everything was made to order in a small kitchen. We would go back here."}
{"text":"Like many others, I have always walked by but never tried this place. Unfortunately, it seems that I have not missed out on much. The staff seemed less than enthused to be serving us. Upon arrival we were sat at a table that was in complete darkness. With barely any other patrons in the dining room, we kindly asked to switch tables. The server rolled his eyes and complied. Our waters were served quite late. My halibut was very good but the poor service was more rememberable. Thus, 2 stars."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  We came in because my husband had a good deal on a groupon.  The ambiance was slightly upscale for the neighborhood, but we were dressed pretty casual.   Our waitress was pretty nice and knowledgeable of the menu, which came to be quite useful when we were told that they were out of both risottos which is what we both opted for initially.   We ended up ordering the meatballs for appetizer. The meatballs were pretty flavorful and satisfying for an app.   I ended up getting the mushroom ravioli with scallops  when they ran out of the mushroom risotto. Despite the fact that I did not originally order this dish, I was so glad I ordered it and took the waitress's recommendation. The raviolis were very flavorful with that earthiness that mushrooms tend to have. The sauce that accompanied this dish was mushroomy and creamy, just amazing topped with scallops. Overall this dish was very, very good and delicate at the same time.   My husband had the bucatini with wild boar bolognese. My husband was not too impressed with this dish, and to be honest, compared to my dish, it was night and day.   Overall it was a good experience and would be willing to return, especially because of the reasonable prices and to actually try that mushroom risotto, because that mushroom sauce was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Went here on a quiet Friday evening with friends. The place is much more sophisticated than it looks from the outside so the prices are deceivingly high. I ordered the mushroom ravioli, which is served with chicken, tomatoes and a white cream sauce. The pasta was good, but the sauce was quite heavy and I was unable to finish. It was a little disappointing because the dish was $18 for about 5 raviolis in a sauce I couldn't even eat. At that price, I'd expect a little better. A friend ordered the 10oz. filet mignon, which was delicious and served with cheesy potatoes au gratin. Others ordered the mafalda pasta but they forgot the cheese one of them.  Our server was great -- I half expected subpar treatment at such a place being a bunch of hungry casually-dressed grad students, but he was very attentive and pleasant, even answering questions about the food with detail and without judgment. Overall a very nice meal, despite the fact that some of the clientele seemed bothered by our presence (seems most customers were older, more affluent type).  At the end of the day, I just felt it was overpriced. I wouldn't expect $20 simple pasta dishes and $35 entrees at a place located around the corner from numerous universities and across from a Quizno's."}
{"text":"This is the best place I've had Italian food in Pittsburgh.  Had Bruschetta for an appetizer.  Nice and crunchy and the cherry tomatoes were a nice twist.  Cheese ravioli was to die for!  Service was nice.  Atmosphere is quiet so great place for a date.  They also are very accomodating if you have any special requests or dietary restrictions.  The only thing I didn't like was the price.  This place is closed for lunch.  Seems like such a missed business opportunity since they're located right by 2 universities.  If they had a cheaper lunch meal I would come here regularly."}
{"text":"Nick Senske stars as the new executive chef of Lucca. The appetizers are amazing from the cheeses paired with fig jam and crispy prosciutto to the lightly fried calamari with spicy tomato sauce and peppers. Be sure to try the pastas which are made in house using locally sourced vegetables for the sauces. The meatballs are also handmade to order and are full of flavor. Together, it's easily best dish of spaghetti and meatballs (topped with melted straciatella cheese). The tagliatelle is just as good if not better. My favorite entrees are the filet, veal, or the mixed grill are always solid choices. But do not miss out on the marvelous molten lava cake!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pastas and huge portions. I would recommend their fish dishes. They are definitely pricey, but Lucca always cooks the fish perfectly. The service is great, and it is not typically crowded, even on a weekend. I can only give four stars though, because of these higher-than-necessary prices and the mediocre desserts. I've had the molten chocolate cake on two different occasions and both times it was overbaked. It ended up as solid, dry cake - not molten at all! However, for a nice dinner place I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'd like to share a recent encounter, maybe amusing, possibly not. My companion was debating whether to mention that the artichoke in his pasta was not just heart, but also leathery, inedible leaves. But they made a good pile at the bottom of the plate, so he pointed them out to the server who said he'd mention it to the chef. The server was dispatched from the kitchen to report that \"that was the way they came out of the can of artichoke hearts\". Really, from a self-respecting chef? I'll tell you what: give me the brand name, I'll buy some other brand and eat at home."}
{"text":"Order the Brussels and steak with bacon jam. The cocktails were perfection, be aware the selection is more about whisky than wine. My partner ordered a pasta dish with chicken and the poultry was not seasoned. He found it to be underwhelming although the pasta was perfection. I think any Italian making that statement is a win in my book. We will be back, soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, amazing stained glass windows in the private party room, and an peaceful outdoor patio for fresh breezes, people watching, and classy tranquility.    The friendly and knowledgeable staff bring perfectly prepared fresh dishes.  Anything involving pasta is particularly expertly served up by this Italian ristorante.  Why not give Lucca the full fiver? All the dishes were very standard fair, no imaginative surprises, and were a bit heavy on the oil.    A lack of innovation, does not mean a lack of flavor or quality, but for $20-$40 entrees I'd like a twist.  Come for a celebratory lunch, get appetizing entrees at half the evening prices and enjoy the uncrowded upscale ambiance and the shining Craig street sunshine! Bell√≠simo!"}
{"text":"I'm not necessarily sure how I feel about this place. We went on New year's Eve and without warning switched to a special menu. I ordered the black truffle gnocchi because it was the only vegetarian option. I must say that it was pretty good, but it was bit of a bummer as I was hoping there would be more pasta options. Regardless, it was really good. I also ordered the fennel salad - which was so, so. I don't know what was in it, but it was a bit tart on an oblong plate, so it kept falling off of the sides. I was trying to be fancy, but I was failing since I had fennel all over the table. My date was intending on getting the butternut squash ravioli, but because of the special menu she got some ravioli with sausage.  The atmosphere was nice, the waitress was kind, my date was perfect, so those were the saving graces in my opinion. Despite that, I still don't know how I feel about the place. Maybe the regular menu has better options than what we were presented with, I'm reluctant to try again."}
{"text":"I came here around 5pm on a Sunday and it was quite empty. The waiters were nice and the service was prompt. I really enjoyed my ravioli and the fettuccine was also quite delicious. It's great that you have the option to add chicken, shrimp, or scallops for an additional price. My one complaint is that the bread was room temperature/cool instead of warm. Overall, a nice restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating! I'd most likely come here again."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time over the weekend.  I didn't drink, but my husband said the drinks were actually mixed correctly and that they were good.  Our food was amazing and the portions were perfect.  The only thing is that our waitress wasn't the best.  She didn't refill our water very quickly and on the menu it doesn't state a couple of things.  For example, I ordered scampi and it didn't say that it came with rice, because of that I ordered a side of paste which I wouldn't have ordered if I had known my meal came with rice.  Good food, good ambiance and a great time with my friends."}
