{"text":"We stopped in this past Saturday evening. The place was slow, so seating was quick. Our server was very attentive and did a great job. The abbreviated menu, left me wanting more regular Sonoran fare. Once again this store has done away with RED chile. I can't think of a Sonoran Mexican restaurant, that doesn't offer red chile. The Depot cantina menu still offers this. Why differentiate one store from another?"}
{"text":"Whomever decide to change to these new awful chips and salsa made a bad call.  The new chips are cheap store bought ones and not very good.  The food wasn't much better.   Not impressed at all.   Was hoping that with a smaller menu the quality would improve, but it didn't.    The waitress was nice enough but service was very slow.  Our food took probably 25-30 minutes, my daughters lunch came out around 10-15 mins before ours so by the time ours got there we had a bored toddler that already ate and was ready to go.    Not a good experience.  Don't know if we will try it again."}
{"text":"Wish I could have given 1/2 star. BAD & SLOW service, BLAND food, poor management and a crappy atmosphere made for horrible experience. I will NEVER eat there again and suggest you don't either. Phoenix has plenty of better Mexican food places to eat at.  Let's start with outside signage sucks, couldn't find the place without GPS.  We waited to be seated and only got seated cause someone happened to notice we were standing at the door.  As for the seating we were put in the back when there were plenty of tables available toward the front.  I don't like sitting by the \"waiter station\".  The waitress who happened to be working our table was at said waiter station and didn't even acknowledge us and we were sitting next her. No \"i'll be right with you or here's some menus\" NOPE just ignored.  I also witnessed this piss poor service happen to  several other customers. Service was slow and mediocre at best, drinks were bad, food was overpriced for what we got.  I had street shrimp tacos and they tasted like they had been frozen and then boiled and put on the taco shells and served (COLD). They had absolutely NO flavor NONE....not what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant.  Also, the so called manager looked like she just cut class from high school and didn't have a clue her customers were not happy."}
{"text":"Boom!! Greg was awesome, food and drinks were awesome.. I had my doubts as I had not had very good experiences with the old macayos...but I have nothing but good things to say about the dinner and service we received. Thanks Woodys!"}
{"text":"First our server Kendra was amazing. She served us quickly and accurately. Her recommendation of Pozole with cilantro rice was perfect. Hubby had \"green chili pork\" which made us laugh because from California we say Chili Verde. She had never heard of it. But it was great. Everything was awesome! Highly recommend this place. Sorry one of the pics was after the fact. Lol."}
{"text":"Grew up loving macayos and going for every special occasion possible. I don't live in Arizona anymore so when I'm in town, I go as much as possible. Was at this location twice in the last week and the hot sauce was not close to tasting the same and was simply not good. The food was fine. I hope it was just a bad batch... To compare, I also went to the macayos on bell road in Glendale in the last week, I said I love the place, and their hot sauce was spot on and perfect!!!"}
{"text":"These 5 stars are for the artistry that goes on behind the bar. I couldn't have imagined that such creative mixology has a home at the venerable Phoenix landmark that is Woody's Macayo.  So where to start? I'm a mezcal  drinker, so I ordered the piña picante. The mezcal they used was very mild with a hint of smoke, so it was not overpowering at all. My friends who like to joke around that mezcal tastes like a dirty ashtray actually said the cocktail was tasty. The sweetness of the pineapple was balanced by a tiny kick of chili pepper. I also enjoyed the other mezcal drink called Verde Da Vida, an ever-so slightly sweet concoction that included lychee and kiwi.  One of the more creative cocktails was based on a spirit I generally dislike, gin. But I had a sip --actually more than a sip --and I didn't even know that I was drinking gin. I could taste cucumbers, honeydew melon,  a hint of Absinthe, and pepper. No single flavor dominated the other. That's what is good about the cocktails here. They taste good, even to those who shy away from a particular spirit, because all of the ingredients are carefully balanced.   There are no \"candy\" margaritas made from sugary, fattening fruit syrups at this bar, so My friends and I didn't  have to worry about a spike in blood sugar or empty calories settling around our waistlines. One friend ordered the Tiki de Peche, which contained a variety of ingredients. Including  French peach wine and freshly made mango purée, and a splash of Absinthe. This margarita was very strong, not too sweet, just right.   A word of advice: come with lots of friends so you can share your cocktails and try everything without getting drunk and falling asleep in the booth."}
{"text":"The end of an era....we used to go to the old location regularly and were so excited when they finally opened the new location nearby. They have completely missed he boat and I'm sad to say Woody would be greatly disappointed his name is associated with this atrocious location. We went on a weekday for lunch and the place was less than half full. It took several minutes for our sever to greet us and he appeared overwhelmed. Once our food arrived 25 minutes after we ordered, my food was cold and my coworkers' food was the wrong order. My coworker ordered a bean burrito with red sauce and when it arrived it was a burrito filled with meat. We tried to get the attention of our server who was no where to be seen. My other coworker took the plate up to the front counter and asked for the correct order of a bean burrito. The server began to argue with her about the order indicating a \"green\" burrito had been ordered. She then asked for a manger and was told there wasn't a manager available. It was just an awful experience. The food is overpriced and service was horrendous. Such a shame as this used to be a legendary family owned restaurant for decades."}
{"text":"First time visiting the new Woody's Macayo sense they toward down the old Macayo Not far from the old location. We decided to drop by and try out there reverse happy hour 8pm to Close.  Very nice inside very clean and modern and A little touch of old and new.  Great service definitely order the 1800 margarita and the mini tamale bites yummy yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I loved Maycao's throughout my many, many, many years in the Valley. I loved the kitsch of the old location on Central.  I normally go to the location on West Bell. On this occasion, we had tickets to a show downtown, and I wanted to get a couple of jars of Maycayo's salsa.  Perfect opportunity to check out the new location. To start with the new decor is \"trendy.\" They are trying way-y-y to hard. The room is all wood. The is nothing to soften the sound. While we were eating, the sat a group of sixteen near us. We got out fast.  Not only is the new space much smaller, but so is the menu. Gone were my steak fajitas.  I had a Maycao Bowl. It was good, but not what I wanted. Then when I checked with the manager, not only did the Central location no longer have jars of salsa, but the manager had never even heard of the jars of salsa. The manager offered us some of the restaurant's salsa. But she agreed with me, that it could not sit unrefrigerated, until we got home again.  Macayo's don't get people addicted to your salsa, and then make it impossible to find. Most commercial salsas use vinegar. I hate vinegar.  I think I'll stick to the Macayo's in my neck of the woods. They don't have the jars of salsa, either, but at least they have the full menu.  I was contacted by the manager and offered a gift certificate for a free meal. To give them another chance.  I went to the Macayo's at 59th & Bell Red. It is the closest one to my home. It was great!!  My hubby, Grumpy doesn't care for cheese crisps. The meal included an appetizer, so I ordered one. It was unlike any other.  Macayo's twice bakes (I asked) theirs. The first bake is the flour tortilla shell alone. This crisps up the shell nicely. Then they add the cheese and re-bake. It makes for a really crunchy, cheesey snack. We both gobbled it down sans toppings. I even skipped the salsa. It was that good. Grumpy was also a fan. For dinner, I had the steak fajitas, Grumpy had the Steak Cortez. Well polished it off with a creamy Flan.  The food was all wonderful. Everything I've always loved about Macayo's. Even down to the kitschy & colorful Mexican decor.  My night was further enhanced, by my recently acquired knowledge, that I could get jars of salsa at any Basha's grocery store.  Thank you Macyao's for restoring my faith in you!!  And for the good meal!!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I'm so sad now. It's not only the decimated menu, but it is consistently the worst service I have received. Servers are checked out, sometimes rude, always slow. I have come three times in the last month and a half with different friends, each time hoping the service will be different if I come at lunch or happy hour or dinner. It's not. As we speak, I'm here for lunch. We have been here for 30 mins. Empty drinks, no chips, empty salsa. And still our lunch has not arrived. The restaurant is about 1/4 the size it once was, and the service is an even smaller fraction of what it used to be. Macayo's was always an amazing locally owned restaurant chain, and now, the service is so appalling bad, it has completely destroyed my respect for and affinity for their brand and products. It's horrible."}
{"text":"I love the revamp.  My only complaints is the inconsistency and sometimes incredibly slow service."}
{"text":"My first visit to Macayo's since they moved to their new location on Central. Ordered my \"normal\" shredded beef burro, enchilada style, with a side of rice and beans.  My shredded beef burro arrived in a cold flour tortilla with hot enchilada sauce (no rice). I have concluded that the original cooks left with Macayo's original cookbooks!"}
{"text":"So, I'd been waiting and waiting for this location to re-open because I've always loved going to Macayo's on Central. Today my friends and I visited the new location, and were pretty disappointed to find that the happy hour advertised on the Macayo's website does not exist at this location. Apparently this is a specialized, more expensive concept in the Macayo's chain. We ended up just ordering one round of drinks and then heading elsewhere for happy hour. I hope that they'll reconsider the varied concept at this location."}
{"text":"Went to the new one and the prices were generally higher than the old location on 4001 N Central and the menu much reduced. Avacado on your cheese crisp is now $1.00 old location and $2.50 new. Rice and beans on the old location that came with the taco used to be maybe $6 or so but now at the new location its about $9.75. I didnt bother ordering it but I would hope the portion sizes have increased. In summary the selection has dwindled while the prices have skyrocketed. Needless to say, with the huge price increases, I will not be coming back. Which is sad because I had been a long time customer of the facility, but there are too many other mexican restaurants in the area that can give just as good food for much more reasonable prices.  Sorry Macayos, been fun but you have priced me out of being a customer any longer."}
{"text":"My family stoped by for dinner the other night and we had the best experience ever! From start to finish we were treated like royalty. Julie was our server and did an excellent job making sure we had the best experience. Mirna was the manager and she stopped by our table a few times just to make sure everything was what we expected. I have to say best place ever!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine the classic menu that is the tradition of Macayo's with fresh new items and a modern atmosphere????  The new Woody's Macayo's on Central.  Gone is the dated decor and over the top colors.  Everything you loved about Macayo's is still here with a fresh vibrance."}
{"text":"Usually get fast, attentive service here, but unfortunately that wasn't the case today.  The server was slow to get us drinks and slow again to take our order.  The food was brought to the table quickly though.  Very slow after the meal with getting our check and paying.  The restaurant wasn't busy, and in fact a number of the staff were hanging around talking with each other while we waited and waited.  Disappointed, Macayo's can do much better than this!"}
{"text":"Amongst valley Mexican restaurant chains, Macayo's is certainly among the more polarizing.  People usually love em or hate em.  I grew up on Macayo's so I would say for me it wasn't so much love as it was a tradition.  The old Central & Indianola location was my family's goto for Christmas parties, birthdays, celebrations after kids sports games, and for quiet family time.  In 2016, the old building was torn down to make room for a new high rise development.  The old building was worn out and antiquated, but it had charm.  Originally, Macayo's plan was to take over the auto parts store across the street and build their new location there.  When that didn't happen, it was an open question whether Macayo's would even re-open at all.  But then seemingly out of nowhere, Macayo's re-appeared in the space on Central & Clarendon that used to house FEZ.  This is doubly confusing because FEZ claimed they were kicked out of this space because it would be torn down.  Anyway, long story short Macayo's is back and my parents were eager to check it out so I went with them on a Sunday night for dinner.  The exterior of the new Macayo's is relatively untouched from when FEZ used to occupy this space, but the interior has undergone a fairly extensive renovation.  New furniture, a redesigned bar area, and plenty of Mexican themed artwork on the walls.  The seating is a little cramped but can hold probably just over 100 at a time including the outside patio on Central Avenue.  I had anticipated the menu being similar to the old place, but to my astonishment they've scaled it back quite a bit.  Instead of a multi page menu book with a variety of options, its all on one side of one page.  I'm usually cool with this if their remaining offerings are of top quality.  Though I'll be honest it's a disappointment to no longer see the Baja Burro on their menu.  That was an item I grew up with.  I'm sure many loyal patrons will also be surprised to see so many of their usual offerings missing at the new place.  Determined to make the best of the new experience here, I ordered their signature dish.  Woody's Original Chimichanga.  Your choice of meat (chicken for me), wrapped in a tortilla with chile relleno sauce, sour cream and mixed cheeses.  Attempting to recreate my Baja Burro past, I ordered my Chimichanga Baja style with their spicy Baja sauce.  Came with a side of black beans.  Total cost for the Chimichanga, water, tax and tip came to about $16.  The Chimi was pretty much as I remembered as was the Baja sauce.  The Baja Burro they served was typically much more liberal with the sauce than they were with the Chimi, but there was enough there to mostly satisfy.  I'll have to try some of the other classic items at another time, but based on the Chimi, the food here appears to fit the familiar Macayo's profile.  Let's put it this way.  If you enjoyed the old world charm of the old location, the new location will be an acquired taste (and I think I'm being fairly charitable there).  If you liked the extensive menu of items the old Central Avenue location offered, you will also likely be a little deflated to see a relatively minimalist menu at the new location.  If you didn't feel like the food at the old location was anything special, the new place probably won't change your mind.  But if you like most of what Macayo's offers and prefer a more modern looking upgrade to the old place, you just might enjoy this new spot.  It's early yet (they've only been open at the new location less than a month as I write this), so they'll have time to tinker.  For now, I would say that Macayo's remains a gringo family friendly Mexican sit down spot.  The food doesn't have a wow factor, but it remains consistent.  Something I'm sure Woody and Victoria Johnson took great pains to maintain for their now 72 year old Phoenix establishment."}
{"text":"I went to the new location on central I loved the ambiance and the energy of the staff. I try the burger and egg it was amazing. I highly recommend this place. the patio is beautiful with the city noise in the background."}
{"text":"First time to the new location...200 ft South of where it was. This place looks like a hipster's dream come true. It doesn't look Anything like a Mexican restaurant anymore. All of its personality it GONE!  And please turn down the techno music - I'm trying to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed in the new location. The menu and drinks are different and much more expensive. They don't carry the traditional margarita mix at this location. My Señor Bob and Chacha mugs don't even work here. The happy hour  is much more expensive.  I do appreciate the modern look of the place but they have totally lost their value in tradition here.  Makes me so sad!"}
{"text":"The steak tacos were good, the service was friendly, the environment was tidy and hip. However, the prices seemed slightly for quantity and quality. I paid $30 for something that would be $17 anywhere else. The salsa is very good, some of best I've had recently.   Overall, I would not return for the simple reason listed above....to expensive."}
{"text":"Serive is always great and the food is amazing!  Been coming to the central location for years.  I will say with any good restaurant comes good clientele and sometimes there could be a wait... let me tell you it is well worth the wait!!! They always take care of you while you're waiting, you still have chips, you still have salsa and you still have your drink while your waiting (remember people the wait staff does not control the kitchen...  sometimes things just happen, so be nice to your servers!)  Love this place and I will  continue to be a loyal customer! Shout out and a thank you to all the staff!"}
{"text":"We had a nice visit at Macayos! It's been years and years since we've been, but the food was just as good as we remember. We were promptly seated and service was pretty good except for when it was time to satisfy the bill, that took a bit longer than it probably should have. ?  You've gotta get the cheese crisp - just total nostalgia. Their best hot sauce is the Picante salsa. You can't go wrong on the menu. I got the taco plate with chicken tinga with rice and beans, it was perfect. Hubs got an enchilada plate with the beef enchilada, a chicken Baja enchilada and a cheese enchilada. IMO, the cheese enchiladas with red sauce are the absolute way to go (but I've been eating them all my life, so what do I know?).   Service was kind and our waters were always filled up. You need to get the hot salsa along with the fresh tomato salsas!  BY THE WAY: I just noticed they charge $1.50 for a side of sour cream.   Also, because of the very slow service, I docked it a star."}
{"text":"The food is ok, it's typical Tex Mex, BUT the girl who took my phone order Her name starts w a J... Jeyna or something, was amazing. Not only did she make my terrible day brighter, she was professional, and quick. Thank you for the kind message on my Baja sauce girly!  you rock."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends and family for food and drinks.  Good Food, good service, great prices."}
{"text":"I am simply AMAZED at how attentive Macayo is to making things right! Most recently, I wrote \"I did not enjoy my time at this place in downtown Phoenix because we got there for happy hour at about 5:30 and the guy serving argued with us that they did not have a happy hour menu and requested we order off the menu, so we did, and 20 minutes later came back to inform us \"I just checked with my manager and happy hour is over at 6 pm\" and all I could say was really?\". I'm really impressed how the managers went about to reach out and discuss the it AND can't wait to give them another chance"}
{"text":"Well. We've tried multiple times but they've ruined Macayos. It is way too loud. Acoustics are so bad, do not go if you want to have a conversation. Don't go if you love the original Macayos. They have done away with the original fresh chips. They are store bought, hard and stale now. Don't go if you want their red beef tamales. Those are gone too. There are other changes in the food, none of which are for the better. After 35 years of our Macayos family tradition we are saying goodbye to Macayos and goodbye to the poor service at Central & Indian School."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out their new location and was very pleased.  We ordered a few margaritas which were brought to us promptly, and had to convince myself to try something else other than my favorite dish, the chicken poblano, and I was not disappointed. I got the carnitas torta, which is so good that it might be my go to dish from now on. I also had a bite of my friends burger with an egg, might have to get that at another time. The restaurant is cozy and more modern, the staff is great, and the food is amazing.  Leave room for dessert because they have a bread pudding made with Mexican chocolate that is to die for.  They also have breakfast on the weekends, which I'm excited to try out."}
{"text":"Wow! A truly excellent experience. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a smile by Greg. He took care of us the rest of the night and we were blown away with his fast and knowledgeable service. He was funny, attentive and made some great recommendations. We also got to talk to Julien, one of the managers, and he was very friendly as well. Felt like family. The ambience and decor was very nice and modern, comfortable. The food exceeded our expectations. The chicken nachos were the best we have ever had. The Mexican corn was beyond phenomenal. Everything was amazing. Our daughter enjoyed the experience as well, and she loved the attention she got from the employees. This will be one of our go to spots in the future!"}
{"text":"Really? This what we waited and called and checked on to see if they were open, months of waiting for an overpriced chipotle with a bar. We used to live this place. There are much better locations. Nice try, nice fail Woody's. They should pull the franchise from them.  As for the service the staff is great try as they may and as sweet as they are, you can't sell this crap as Macayo's.  Yes I still tipped well I'm not an asshole. But we will not be back.   Also wtf where is the fried ice cream!!! Could you not make that hip and cool?"}
{"text":"I eat a mostly vegan diet. Before we went here for lunch as an office outing, I contacted the restaurant and they said the only thing I could have is the Mercado chopped salad without cheese or tortilla strips. I ordered this, also without pico (I don't like uncooked tomatoes) and dressing on the side. I wasn't impressed - basically a mountain of lettuce with a little black beans, corn, squash, and pumpkin seeds. I'm glad I got the dressing on the side because the salad was already wet (from the greens?) and the dressing wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Memory is that I was here on their opening week.  Restaurant was very clean and their staff was very very friendly and excited.  While a few notches above Chipotle, the atmosphere is very fast casual.  Food quality seems to be the same as traditional Macayos.  While the restaurant has been refreshed, the drink menu remains in the mid 2000s."}
{"text":"So now an update to my update:  Came back today and requested to substitute a cup of tortilla soup instead of the beans as my side. The waitress stated they couldn't do that and I told her of my conversation with the manager previously and she said they must have decided not to keep the cups. She then offered to upcharge me $3.50 for a small amount in a salsa cup. So I declined her offer because there was no way I was going to pay an additional $3.50 for a replacement of my beans and especially in a salsa dish that holds barely 1/4 cup. While waiting for our food to arrive she ended up bringing me a cup of the soup in one of their dessert cups stating they decided they could use one of them. This made me very happy although I was already embarrassed by having to have all of my coworkers witness the previous exchange and give me a ribbing about it.  Oh well - at lease I got my cup of tortilla soup. I did order something I had never tried before, the Chicken Poblano, and it was very good. Definitely something I would eat again.      This is an update to my previous review. I was contacted by the manager in regards to my previous review and he invited me back to try them again. He apologized profusely for the plastic that I found in my soup and indicated that they have discontinued the process that resulted in it ending up in my soup. He stated that the first couple opening weeks were very rough on the staff and they were still ironing out the details. He assured me that guests may still order items off the previous menu if it can be accommodated. He said they also went as far as to obtain several small cups to begin offering the cups of tortilla soup again which made me very happy. This time I ordered a chicken taco and cheese enchilada with the cup of chicken tortilla soup. And it was 100% improved! The taco was full of moist chicken and the taco shell was crispy and not broken. The cheese enchilada was plump full of cheese and onions and piping hot. My chicken tortilla soup was packed with chicken and chunks of avocado with my crispy tortilla strips on top. My friend had ordered a beef chimichanga and he said it was delicious also! Although our meal was comped, my new review is not based off that fact at all. I was glad to see the management is seriously looking into fixing their issues and taking their guest's complaints to heart.   Previous review:  I was very saddened when Macayo's on Central closed and waited impatiently for them to re-open. They finally did and I went with a couple of my coworkers. I was looking forward to getting my usual Mix-n-Match Two (Chicken Taco & Cheese Enchilada) with my side being a cup of their Chicken Tortilla Soup. Their new inside is nice and inviting and a definite improvement. We were greeted and seated promptly. I began to review their menu and thought that they must have forgotten to give us the rest of it. We flagged down the waitress and she told us that the menu had been re-done as well and that many of our old favorites had been removed. I was heartbroken. As I reviewed my options I found that I could get a combination platter that contained a taco, cheese enchilada, and bean tostada. I noticed they still had the soup but at a price tag of $7.00 for a bowl. I asked the waitress if it would be possible to just get a small cup to go along with my meal. She went to check and came back and stated that it was not possible. At that point I decided to go ahead and order it but \"to go\" so that I could have it for dinner that evening along with the cheese enchilada since I was sure that the taco and bean tostada would be plenty for my lunch. The waitress took our orders and then we began to wait. And wait. And wait. It took forever for our food to arrive and when it finally did all 3 of us were less than impressed. You would think that since they had simplified their menu then the limited items they had chosen to keep would have been great. But unfortunately this was not the case. My taco came out with the shell already broken on the bottom. The cheese enchilada was so skinny and hardly contained enough filling to make 3 bites out of it. And my tostada was cold and the shell underneath was soggy and there was no way I could have picked it up. Very disappointing. To top it off, I hadn't looked in the to-go bag (I had also ordered Hubby a chimichanga meal along with my soup) until later that evening. When I pulled out the soup I couldn't believe I had been charged $7 for it. It was in a small container (that appeared to be not much bigger than the \"cup\" I used to get) and it was mostly all broth with very little substance to it. In addition they had put in the tortilla strips already so of course they were all soggy and now I couldn't enjoy the little bit of crunch that they usually provide. But even worse - I found a piece of plastic in it!! I was dumbfounded! So needless to say I am very saddened by all of this. I don't know if any of us will ever be back."}
{"text":"when the Macayo's on central closed, they said they were relocating down the street but would be retaining the food. WELL......... NOT so much!.. The moved into the building next door to FEDEX on central so they have about 10% of the room they used to have, and you can take what little decor they have and swap it with any of 4 or 5 restaurants up and down Central Ave and not know the difference. So the ambiance of the old Macayo's went on the construction scrap heap as well. 2nd, the menu is extremely limited and the quality has definitely taken a hit. It's turned into a quick stop after work for a drink and then go someplace else to have fun. Applebee's just up the street has 500% more atmosphere than this new (sad) rendition of What was a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Sat at bar, waited awhile until server came with chips and salsa. She was quick to get our drinks once placed than disappeared. She had two tables of six plus bar...at first was just us than 3 more sat. I came in for a simple cheese crisp and left disappointed.  Chips were okay, salsa was okay, no spicy. Even my extremely patient boyfriend said this is bad.   Still sitting here waiting to pay, card in my hand, up where  SOMEONE could see. Finally man walked up and I had to ask him to close my tab. 1 horchata and 1 kilt lifter, going home to make a sandwich. High point, he didn't charge for my horchata that I didn't even drink half way...it was too sweet for me. :/"}
{"text":"Love the new Macayo's concept! No longer kitschy Tex-Mex but a modern take on Mexican cuisine. The atmosphere is very relaxed and  inviting and the staff is attentive and friendly. They even offer breakfast now which was delicious and got me through the day! Definitely recommend the Carne Asada Torta."}
{"text":"We had family day here, service was good, food was very delicious, especially the Mexican corn. Yummy!! Reasonably priced, we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I go to this place all the time! We used to go to the original Woody' s on Central and were so sad to see it go.  My husband and I went out first date there and are now happily married with 3 kids, one on the way!  Our favorite app is the queso fundito (cheat day)! We love the atmosphere and the delicious food.  We recommend it to everyone and love to take family and friends over for a night out.  We went last time with a party of 8 and the service was amazing and everyone left full and ready for a nap! Keep doing what you do we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sad to report that food was only par and service was abysmal with waitresses acting as though they were doing us a favor by stopping by our table - often requiring us to flag them down."}
{"text":"Diverse menu. Excellent food. Great service. Broad hours to serve all.  New location is modern, clean and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. It wasn't crowded yet it took about 10 minutes to even get drinks. It took a long time to also order an appetizer. So we chose not to order our main meal here.  Whil we always enjoy food at Macayo's, this experience was by far the worst we've seen.  We are so disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped by for the reverse happy we saw posted from 8 pm on. Food and service was excellent. Speedy, prompt, huge short rib nachos that were good with some flavorful corn and tacos. Will be going back soon. More HH options would be nice but its a still a good selection."}
{"text":"This Macayo's was recently renovated from the iconic pyramid style building located in the heart of midtown Phoenix, to a very modern approach to American Mexican cuisine. Unfortunately, it seems like the change also catered in a new menu that offers less items and not very many of the traditional Macayo's menu items. My experience at this location definitely clocked in as a subpar visit. I was disappointed in the variety of the menu, the quality of service, and general atmosphere of the restaurant. It saddens me to report that this location no longer sports the warm, traditional feeling of a Macayo's restaurant. Sad day, Macayo's  UPDATE: Macayo's management contacted me to invite me in for a follow-up to my previous review. On my second visit to this location, the service and the food were much better. Upon my exit, the management was very kind and listened to all of my feedback from my prior visit and more than made up for it. They also shared their plans for future restaurant development and how they plan on continuing making Macayo's a great place for Phoenicians to dine. Updated star ranking from 3 to 4 stars. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place seems to be trying to appeal to the banal tastes of snow-birds from the upper Midwest.  I ordered a simple bean burro (as they're known in traditional Arizona) and two sides: a Mexican corn thing and a cilantro rice affair.    The burro resembled something that you'd expect at Taco Bell on a tortilla that probably came from a shelf in the local Safeway.  The corn was loaded with some sort of cheese and was bland, and the rice - tasteless.  My first clue was the tepid salsa (that seemed like a mild version of Pace) that accompanied the chips.  I asked for something a bit spicier and was provided a thinner version - equally bland."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch. The location definitely has a different feel than the previous building and the other locations. I actually like it more now, more modern!  My experience was just okay! I ordered a fajita bowl with chicken and was surprised to learn that onions/peppers aren't automatically included. Service was actually pretty fast which was nice.  Overall, nothing about the flavors in the food or service stood out to really gain my interest to return."}
{"text":"This is based on the Central location. The surprise location is great!  What Happened!? We ordered at the central location. The lady who took my order said \"Is that all?\" after every item I ordered. I felt rushed and didn't want to add anything to the order. I was afraid she was getting frustrated.  Eating the meal, the chips are completely different than the other locations. The salad was missing 2 items from the menu. They forgot some sides, which i drove back to get. I hate writing reviews like this but this was frustrating..."}
{"text":"Beware this is not the Macayos you remember.  From what I can gather is that the old building was torn down and replaced with a Chipotle with a small bar.   The food is not the same and had turned from a Mexican food restaurant to a more Americanized chain style food. The special of the day was meat loaf.    My mother in law ordered bean tostada and the waitress kept saying okay okay okay like she knew what the order was but she still put shredded beef on it.   Overall this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was NOT a fan of the original Macayo's and was reluctant to try their new location and name. We came for dinner the first time, just after they opened. Our server was friendly but gave us a lot of misinformation. Regardless, we found some dishes that we liked (shrimp burrito and chicken tinga). We tried a green chili fritter thing that was pretty good, my husband enjoyed it more than I did. The margaritas were really awesome, I will give them that. The manager was very attentive after learning we had some issues and made everything right.   The second time we came for brunch the first weekend they did it. After being seated it was over 10 minutes with no server before my husband requested service. The manager sent someone over and offered us a free cheese crisp. I ordered the chiliquiles and my husband the beef torta, outs were both good. The chiliquiles is a huge portion so may be best to share. Our friend order the breakfast sandwich and absolutely loved it. Our other friend ordered al a carte some eggs, potatoes, calabacitas, and something else and also loved it. Again, margaritas were very good and inexpensive.   Overall, I would give the service a 3 and the food a 5. Come in understanding that they are still working out kinks and you will likely have a very good meal."}
{"text":"This is my first negative review. I've been eating at Macayo's around the Valley for 14 years and this was my first disappointing experience. When we first arrived, we were told that we couldn't sit at the bar because it was closed. We were seated at a booth and our drink orders were taken. Roughly 8 minutes later a waiter came over to take our drink orders. We explained we already gave our drink orders and he looked puzzled. He went to get our drinks and brought them back with chips & salsa. The salsa was amazing as always, but the chips were crushed. I ordered the burro with pico de gallo, but when the plate arrived it was just shredded cabbage and no pico. My drink was empty and the waiter was nowhere to be found. I went up to the bar to order another drink and the waiter saw and ran over to tell me he would bring it to the table, which he did. The menu is considerably smaller than at the old location and prices are higher. I love Macayo's but I don't think I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Loved my servers and food I got on resteraunts but order to go was a joke. I ordered green chili to go with two sides total 1500 extra for rice and corn this is what I got."}
{"text":"Happy Hour: Daily 3pm - 6pReverse happy hour 8pm-close.   This was my first time at the new Woody's Macayo location on central ave and went for drinks and appetizers. The 5$ happy hour Margarita was pretty tasty and the Green Corn Tamale Bites are delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was sensational. Try the skinny margarita, you will love it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing..... However, they could use the help of a host or hostess to seat customers and ensure the wait time for a server is minimal--waited nearly 45 minutes to get a menu and order a drink!!  I'm very displeased with the customer service of the new Macayo's and to make matters worse, our server wanted to argue about the wait time!   The staff was obviously overwhelmed and very impatient-didn't even take the time or effort to provide the same level of customer service I was accustomed to from the old Macayo's.   Guess it's time to look for a new favorite spot..."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday night.  Practically empty dining room.  Stood for a bit at the entrance. Finally seated.  Took sometime before chips/salsa arrived.  No drink menu which I thought odd. Why don't you have a drink menu on the table? Ordered house margaritas. ( why weren't we told it's reverse happy hour?) Ordered our food. Me fish tacos and Sonoran enchilada trio.  Food is very good.  Just the lack of attention to the table clean up and overall service. Not great.  No traditional Macayos here.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Got all excited about having Mexican food for lunch. Thought I'd try out the new Woody's Macayo on Central Avenue. Ended up waiting in a people clump for over ten minutes while the entire wait staff ignored us  like we were all invisible. Oddly, the place was only 50% full (or, for all those Mexican food loving pessimists out there, 50% empty) but zero effort was made by staff to make eye contact or to seat any of us.   Finally, a confused looking woman wandered up and peeled off two clumpsters from our pack and whisked them away to a table way in the back. Since I had zero confidence that she'd ever find her way back to us again, I broke loose and claimed my own table. That's when I noticed that the floor around me was slimy and grimy and gooey. Many of the chairs; including mine, had bits of food stuck to the upholstery. But the absolute \"instant appetite killer\" for me was the \"belly-up-dead\" cockroach staring up at me from Macayo's cold, concrete killing floor.    My recommendation to the owners: buy a good mop and hire an even better manager."}
{"text":"Nice new upgrade to the old place.  Much smaller but I hear they are expanding.  Way quieter than the old location and the same recipes but I believe the menu is smaller, however it still offers a great variety to chose from.  The way the food is displayed is so much nicer too.  Fresh food, great service and a modern atmosphere.  Give them shot.  I'll definitely be back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a awsome experience this is the first time I've ever been to a grand opening and it was Epic... It was packed but still the atmosphere was fantastic...Jeff was friendly and anticipated our needs...which is always nice!! Keep it up guys and I'll keep coming...and I'll bring a friend every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Had some friends from out of town want to come here. And I'd been wanting to try it. Being a Mexican food enthusiast, and from L.A. it was not the best I've had but it wasn't't bad either. The food was okay (but I was hangry), the service was excellent and the drinks delish. I still can't bring myself to give this place more than three stars though.   Phoenix is full of top notch Mexican food places, but this is not one. It gave me the \"Acapulcos\" (if you know what restaurant that is) kinda feel. Very commercial, cater to Americans kinda feel. Not authentic. But if you are looking for somewhere to take people who don't know or appreciate authentic Mexican, then bring them here. Also, when the Mexican server tells us not to order the guacamole, that's saying something."}
{"text":"We only had drinks and we'll be back for more. We like that it's open more and brighter than their old location. It's a nice chance to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa here are SO good! The service has been stellar both times I've been, and the burritos are delicious. I got the patron margarita last night and really enjoyed it. I would give it five stars, however it is incredibly loud in there. I could barely hear the people at my table because of the juke box love jams that were blasting so loud!"}
{"text":"The new restaurant is nice but honestly I feel like their salsa is pretty generic. They're food is good but also overpriced for what you receive. I do recommend the Baja sauce if you have the option. Overall a pretty generic Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"It is my pleasure to give this New Macayo's the highest rating. I, with my fellow coworkers, had lunch in the patio on Monday, November 13th. Our server was the most wonderful young man named Greg Montelongo, who made all feel special as if he had known us forever. He made sure that our glasses were never emptied, made sure we all were taken care of. When he took our orders, he was amazing to all 7 of us, went through the lunch specials with such great ease, willing to answer any questions we made have had. Greg was friendly and so professional and had a great smile. The Manager (Brian Collins) even at one point came out to say Hello, was so kind to us all. We had two (2) birthday girls in our group on Monday November 13, Brian gave the Birthday Ladies a free dessert each that was so sweet and thoughtful. We loved it when the staff came out to sing Happy Birthday to both ladies. The food was so yummy and so good. THANK YOU GREG & Brian and the Entire Team for making our luncheon such a very special memory for us all!!    If you are in downtown Phoenix, please stop by and go see Greg and Brian for great food and great time.   Macayo's in Downtown Phoenix was Legendary. Now it the NEW Downtown Macayo's Turn to Rein and Shine. I cannot wait to go back. You cannot ask for a better place to eat with great prices and an outstanding team. THANK YOU GREG & BRIAN!!    With all our Thanks and Gratitude, Marie, Cynthia, Shelby, Brenda, Vera, Amber and Gail."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING I am going to make this very short, we had a party of nine and were seated at a dirty table, one of our group had a BUG in their food, our drinks were messed up, the rice was burned, and when we sent food back, it came back to us without the entire order.  It was a fiasco!  I called the manager the next day and she stated she was going to call me back once she spoke to her general manager about this and I never heard from her again.  Since the move to the new location all I can say is, bad food, bad service and horrible follow through by management.  We will never go there again and I will urge all my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"Came to this place let's just see how the new Macayo's was after reopened. Very excited Seattle the new places. It's not in the same building. The new building is very small and not anything like the original. Very disappointing!  Service was very slow and inattentive.  The place was almost empty and still took us 15 minutes to get a drink order. When the drinks were finally ready the waitress set them on a table next to us while she went to go take care of a table near us. So on a hot day, we sat and watch our drinks sit there and get warm and flat waiting for the waitress to come back and serve us.   We will never make the extra drive into Phoenix for Macayo's again. If you're in the mood, try Depot Cantina in Tempe."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there Sunday 1-14-2018  about 4:30 pm.  We wanted to sit outside and every table was dirty, with used glasses, silverware and plates.  They told us they would clean off a table for us.  Who wants to sit with all these dirty tables around you.  We then asked and they said it was the morning staffs job to clean the tables off.  REALLY???  There were maybe 6 tables inside that were occupied, so there were a few employees just sitting around doing nothing.  It really takes it is not my job to a new level.  Mary H."}
{"text":"Great service & nice selection. Enjoyed the cheese crisp and green corn tamale bites were wonderful too!"}
{"text":"I was here for a company's lunch few weeks ago. When a few of us arrived earlier, the hostess told us that there was no record of a reservation. Then, they changed their story and said that there was, but they did not reserve room inside the restaurant to host the 12 of us. They ended up sitting us in the patio area (when it was close to 100 degree), moved us twice and looked extremely unhappy while putting our tables together. Shortly after we settled in, the sun moved towards us and we were basically sitting there sweating for an hour. To top it off, construction workers were right next to us fixing the road. The whole experience was very unpleasant and the only reason I did not give it a one star is because our waitress was nice. The food was average at best (so typical for downtown). I will most definitely not come back here again."}
{"text":"The entire experience was awesome! It's been a while since we have eaten here. The new location is clean and inviting. When we walked in we were greeted at the door and sat immediately. Our service was spectacular and the food was delicious and the margaritas are worth coming back for! They make their own margarita mix and the happy hour specials are definitely impressive. We will be back for sure!"}
