{"text":"I am a meat eater.  Seriously, I love meat: steak, burgers, chicken, pepperoni, etc.  I don't think I could go on living without it.  HOWEVER: If for some reason my doctor told me that I had to immediately discontinue eating any sort of meat or meat products or else face dire consequences.....well I would probably kick the bucket within a month's time.  Except this is now no longer the case due to my discovery of Alternative Junkie!  Seriously, this is the only vegan food that I would not only eat with a bum's mouth, but I'm actually more than delighted to feed it to myself!  They have somehow cracked the code of turning rabbit feed into divine human food fit for the inner T-Rex in all of us!  So if you want to try something that's good for you, good for the environment, good for creatures lower on the food chain, AND good for your taste buds, I cannot recommend Alternative Junkie enough! TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Tacos, sandwiches, quesadillas...oh my! To quote an old saying from the 90's: \"Where's the beef?\"  Thanks to Alternative Junkie, I can finally answer that with: \"Who f@*&ing cares?!\"  These guys have perfected the all-natural, healthy, and delicious vegan dishes that even a carnivore such as myself can salivate over.  If you haven't given them a try yet, I suggest you do your mouth, your body, your health* and the world a favor and indulge yourself in any (or all!) of their delicious creations!     *Alternative Junkie is recommended by 4 out of 5 doctors as a healthier alternative to your current crappy diet.  The 5th doctor could not recommend it because he lost his writing hand to diabetes before he had the chance to switch to an Alt J meal plan.**   **This is a farcical medical statistic for pure entertainment value"}

{"text":"Love the food from Alternative Junkie! I have been a customer there for a few months now and love the options of the weekly meals... not to mention these vegan meals are NOT bland! It's nice to kick it up a notch with some spice and flavor :) Heidi is also very personable and I have been super happy with every meal I've ordered. It's great to find some great meals to take to work for lunch... not to mention these meals have generous portion sizes particularly for the price ($11). My favorite hands down are the Buffalo Cauliflower Tacos!!"}
