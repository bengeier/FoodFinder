{"text":"oooo myyyy goooodddd. Thank god i found this place, i ate the best lamb biryani i have ever tried in my life. the flavors were soooo tasty. The garlic naan was sooo good i started eating my garlic naan with my lamb biryani .  Nirala my new top pakistani / indian food. The chef came out and thanked me for trying his food. I than thanked him for making it. That kind of service was impressive."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place but am here to taste the food. Ordered halwa poori and will review it later. The place was very busy and seemed a little unorganized.
They asked us to have a seat and wait for 20 minutes.
I ordered 4 halwa puris and 2 niharis.
Each halwa  poori was supposed to come with 2 poori, halwa, chana and achar. When the order arrived, the portion looked too small for the price. They had packed all the 4 halwa orders in one and the chana in another. I asked they person why the portion seemed to small, his answer \"we stopped buffet\". Not the answer to my question but whatever.
I asked for the achar which they were supposed to give and they handed me 1 piece of achaar. I was like what! Where are the rest of the 3? They had to consult with the owner to give me the rest of the 3 achaar pieces and the owner acted as if he was doing me a favor by giving me those 3 achaar pieces that was supposed to give me anyways as I had paid for for 4 halwa pooris and each order comes with 2 poori, halway, chaana and achaar.
Anyways, The food was just OK, nothing special and I do not think I will be returning here or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Their morning breakfast buffet $4.99 includes unlimited puri, served with channa masala, potato curry, and orange Halwa is great. quality always prevails over quantity and you can taste it!

{"text":"I went here with my family for dinner. There was only one person at the front of the store which was fine because the place was empty. There were a few people who came in for take out.

We got beef samosas, chicken samosas, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, sada naan (plain naan), beef keema naan (you can choose the meat you want in it), garlic naan (it's not on the menu but they have it) and russ malai. For the three main dishes, we ordered it as mild and it was just the right amount of heat for me but some of my family members found it a bit too spicy. For a family of four, we finished everything but the chicken tikka masala (partly because it was too spicy and I think we enjoyed the other two main dishes more).

I enjoyed the dessert but I'm a dessert-aholic! The dessert has a distinct flavour that I can't put my finger on ... perhaps it has some floral notes.

I think I would come back here just because it's close to where I live."}
