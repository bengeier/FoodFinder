{"text":"El Chavo is my favorite neighborhood restaurant. Everyone is very friendly and the Tortas etc. are absolutely amazing. The Cubano is to die for."}
{"text":"After 9 years in Tucson I have developed a love for good tortas and Carne asada. This place meets the need for an outstanding torta with lots of fresh ingredients and nicely spiced meats. We had everything on the menu like the Carne asada tacos which were solid, not Carne that had been sitting in a warming pan but fresh grilled to order for the tacos and the quesadilla. The highlight for me was the green Chile beef torta. Perfectly seasoned meat on a toasted bun with fresh sliced avacado! They do tortas right here!"}
{"text":"I think this place used to be a lot better, but maybe it is because of their growing business. They continue to deliver quality tortas but no longer pickup the phone to place carry-out and only give 1 salsa with a torta instead of 2.  The place has been renovated greatly since they first opened and they have more friendly staff.  Brush up on your Spanish if you are going to visit.  The carne asadas tortas is basically the goto item; it is filling, the carne asada has great taste, and they use the freshest vegetables.  Their aguas are also amazing and I recommend the Frutas one that has apple, strawberry, banana, and other magical mixes of fruits."}
{"text":"One of the best tortas place! The Owners make the place more confortable to eat, they are very friendly. :)"}
{"text":"They were out of shrimp but we're really friendly about it and offered several customized options so they get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had a vegetarian torta and it was good. The burgers they have here are not that great. They have these Jalapeños with soy sauce lemon and salt that my brother likes a lot. They do have different aguas frescas like horchata, fresa, Limon, coco, Jamaica, melon. They have ice cream fresas con cream. They have a lot you can choose from."}
{"text":"The cochinita pobil torta is the best sandwich in the Valley of the Sun. Not exaggerating"}
{"text":"Really good tortas but not the best, service was fast and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me sing you the song of my people Aaaajúa!!  Myself and my husband had never been here before. We were in the area house hunting when we pulled in to the parking area. We noticed many people going in and out the door. I asked my husband who swears by the YELP rule of 3 stars or more; if he wanted to just have dinner here. Upon approval. We came in.  There's plenty of seating and ICE COLD A/C The restaurant and grills were really clean The flow of the restaurant was very good. It's cozy but not crowded. THEY HAVE BOLIS!!! Both the young ladies who took our order and poured our aguas frescas were really nice . They were well spoken and courteous when offering samples of the aguas and repeating our orders back. they have a well layed out menu and specialty menus. Don't blink or you'll miss something. We both ordered tortas with sides of rice and beans.  Biddi biddi bom bom!   Perfect beef milanesa torta! Grilled perfectly with mayonesa not butter. And the veggie toppings were good and fresh. Rice was good, beans were on point! I mean ON POINT. My husband had the cochinita piblin torta and he said it was very good.  We washes our meal down with refreshing aguas de cantaloupe and horchata. Left with full bellies. And plans to return"}
{"text":"Okay, let me just tell you straight up and down, if you are looking for authentic, south of the boarder street tacos/ rolled tacos for super cheap, then look no further! I usually never judge a place on it's yelp reviews, mainly because people on yelp are self entitled cry babies who have a chip on their shoulder and think restaurants need to bend over backwards and kiss their behind for blessing them with their presence, but also because places like this get passed over because they are slightly ghetto hole in the walls. But don't let that scare you, the carne asada tacos or potato rolled tacos are hands down the BEST tacos i have ever had! It's also super clean inside and the staff (not the greatest when it comes to speaking english) are super friendly and accommodating! It's a real south of the boarder experience but in my own backyard!!!"}
{"text":"The reason why i Give this Place 3 stars is because the staff is great but lacks in communication, which leaves alot of room for errors. Such as in our case. Its a nice place, That could use improvement. The food is great. But organization is not the best. I will return to this place, and offer them a second chance. In hopes that improvement has taken place. But don't get me wrong, The Food is Great!"}
{"text":"Great fresh made food! Friendly people! Very clean! I was scared the first time because it is a little place in a strip mall, but was pleasantly surprised! Been twice and will continue to eat here! Probably a lot because it's close to home too."}
{"text":"The owners seem to take pride in their craft.  Ever been to a place where the burrito had seven layers but they were arranged vertically?  Not here.  Items are put together with care and made to order.  Shredded beef and chile torta was great."}
{"text":"Great asada tacos and quesadillas.  Definitely a treat for us, being from the East Coast.  One complaint: the menu is relatively limited."}
{"text":"The tortas are bomb. Tiny hole in the wall place in a somewhat suspect part of town. The employees don't speak English, but it really doesn't matter. The food is delicious and they make it super quick. The tortas have heaps of fresh avocado (more than more places would ever put on a single torta). You can get gut busting full for about 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Pure magic in these tortas! I have dreams about these sandwiches! Staff is friendly and food is fresh :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican/Shrimp taco place I tasted in Arizona so far!!!! I'm addicted. The way they cook and season the shrimp is so perfect. Oh not to mention the good rice and beans"}
{"text":"This place is really tasty and good reminds me of homemade Mexican food from my grandma's house what she used to make the store cuz they pretty much used to taste the same way I love being Mexican!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldnt say its the best torta in the east valley but it was pretty good. Their carne asada was seasoned nicely and the bread was fresh but I wish they had toasted it a little bit. Horchata was housemade and also tasty.   Service was friendly and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Love there Carne Asada tacos here almost everyday super friendly staff highly recommend"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches at reasonable prices topped with peppers and avocado. So delicious. You can also add a side of fries or salad. They have other items (that I have yet to try!) such as tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. Great neighborhood place with friendly service, I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I walked over to here and got dinner one night during our stay. The tortas are delicious. We also tried their tacos and flautas were really good too. We'd go back again."}
{"text":"Is probably the best Torta in the East Valley!  Not a huge selection here, but you really wouldn't want to order anything else!  Super fresh bread. Fresh ingredients with huge slices of avocado!  The owners are what make this place special. Super nice guys with great service."}
{"text":"They are so kind here. And the food is so good. My favorite has to be the tacos de Camarón."}
{"text":"Came here last night about 15 minutes before they closed since they were the only torta place opened, so of course I was hoping to have made a right choice when picking El Chavo. But I was VERY impressed with the Torta Cubana I got. Everything was perfect & so delicious that it made me sad that I only got 1! lol. Also the french fries were so delicious! Great place with amazing food!"}
{"text":"It's clean and reasonably priced. Tried a pibil pork taco that was nicely spiced but saaaalty as heck, too bad. Torta was average-sized and was of the green chile beef variety. Stewed meat (not much green chile) fresh veggies and ample avocado! (The avocado was the star of the torta!) The aqua frescas (fruit drinks) looked good and I bought what must be a 5lb round of \"superior\" cheese for $20.00   I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3 for the hopes that the cheese should be pretty good!"}
{"text":"Tried Horchata for the first time here, really good stuff, made in house! I hadn't had a torta either (didn't know there were Mexican sandwiches, is that like a British Burrito?) and it was pretty good. We grabbed some food late night to go and it was good, affordable, and the guy at the counter was nice and helpful with suggestions of what to order."}
{"text":"Nasty food....ordered a carne asada burrito, paid 7.99 for it..the meat was burnt and it had AVOCADO slices instead of guacamole.. hands down the worst"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place has by far the best Mexican food i have ever had see my first review since that review I have eaten there many times but this last time I was grossed out I found a fryed pice of a rubber glove the finger part mixed in with my frys I can never eat there again"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST \"hole-in-the-wall\" I've ever encountered. I originally found this spot driving around, after a rough day at work. I had just moved here from Tucson which is basically the taco capital of the world, and I was craving a piece of my homeland. I'll fight you if you think otherwise. I think I fell in love with the fact that this seems to be THE neighborhood restaurant and that the street tacos are OUTSTANDING--better than any I have ever had. I can never decide between the green chile beef and the carne asada--they are equally fantastic! Just stop by, order more tacos than you think you can eat, and prepare to amaze yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent hidden gem. Their tostadas and tacos are excellent. Way better than the more expensive places around. I'll be going here all the time."}
{"text":"So ive driven by this spot many times. We were in the area during lunch and i talked my coworker into trying it. Its in a sketchy area in mesa so usually that mean we are in for a treat. We walked into a small shop that was completely clean and friendly. We were excited cause right away we saw a baker baking their own torta bread so we were stoked! I ordered a carne asada torta and a horchata and my buddy ended up with a carne asada burrito and we got them to go. It felt like within minutes our orders were ready to go! Once we got back to our jobsite we dove into our food and to our suprise we were both pretty disappointed. There was such little meat in both our items it sucked. All fillers and no thriller... We were pretty disappointed setting as this place isn't cheap. I'll continue driving by hoping one day they give you what you pay for..."}
{"text":"Best tortas in Mesa! My husband comes here for lunch almost once a week. I love how generous they are with the avocado!"}
