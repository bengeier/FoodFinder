{"text":"This reminds me of a homely mom & pop shop. My fiancé and I just moved into the neighboorhood a few months ago, and found this little gem. They serve Chinese and some Filipino dishes. They also do party trays for an amazing price. Although the décor is dated, and the atmosphere isn't your typical grand chinese restaurant, the food makes up for it. The food is really great and fresh! We're planning on ordering some party trays from here for this weekend."}
{"text":"My parents order take out frequently from this place. They love Chinese take out and have ordered from many places in the GTA. We like the food here compared to other places that are even closer to our location. The portion sizes are very generous for their combos (rice, meat, veggies) which are about $5. My fiancé likes the sweet and sour pork combo and Iike the chicken ball combo. Their noodles are also really good."}
{"text":"I don't usually go for Chinese food but I decided to give Wing Sun a try, and I was pretty impressed! The food wasn't oily, and cheap tasting despite the low prices, and large portions! I ordered the typical Chow Mein, Fried Squid, and Honeydew Bubble Tea.  The food was great! Don't expect high quality bubble tea because all you're going to get is the typical powder mixed type! It was just your average bubble tea, nothing special.    The restaurant's ambience was the average asian restaurant; sporting a cozy, homey feeling, rather than luxurious.  Staff was very nice, and accommodating.    Overall a great restaurant if you're looking for quality Chinese food for great low prices!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a 1 star. I walk in. Lady mumbles hi to me from behind the counter, barely acknowledging my presence or even providing guidance with the menu. BTW, half the menu is taped around the place. I ordered my chicken at $7.95 plus tax. Lady tells me 10 minutes and walks away. As I look around while waiting, some poor soul ordered, for pick up, a bunch of chicken wings. Well, they were sitting on a table, uncovered, as numerous flies proceeded to land on the chicken wings. The place overall is a messy dump. The lady went from handling cash, to wrapping food, handling food, and going back and forth from the chicken without once washing her hands, wearing gloves or using tongs. Gross! Anyway, as I'm waiting, I start to develop buyers remorse. I ask what rice my dish comes with in hopes that it would make me spending my money there somewhat valid, when nope...no rice. It's an additional $2 more. So I say no thanks, I want my money back and all of a sudden the lady can add rice to my dish for free! She must think I'm dumb. I refuse and ask repeatedly for my money back. I think I asked for it like 5x before she proceeded to lecture me and informing her. I laughed and pointed to her Microsoft Word stained menu taped to her counter informing her that she's the one who should be informing their customers properly. I asked for my money back again as she lectured to which she responded with a \"you need to wait!!!!\" yell. I'm sorry, I've waited for my money back already considering I've asked for it several times. In fact, after one of those times she went to the kitchen, all the while dragging around the piece of tinfoil that would later wrap the poor soul's wings. Oh, almost forgot to mention that before her lecture she said \"I don't ever want to see you again\". Don't worry honey, I will never set foot in that establishment again. You can get better service, and better food for the same price (if not cheaper) elsewhere.This place is filthy and you'll be treated like crap. Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"The food is ok but oily most if the times . Wings seems to be old. The bubble tea is always too sweet. Gave them couple tries but its always dissapointment ."}
{"text":"I was so angry when I left this place! Years ago the combos were so good I used to dream about them. I ordered my favorite,  the BBQ pork combo with egg fried rice. Usually it comes with broccoli but it came with bean sprouts that were drenched in what tasted like dirty water! The beef... tasted like it was boiled in bbq sauce and water and I got plain fried rice. My order was OVER charged and the lady was plain RUDE! I'll never dream about that place again. WRITE OFF!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years actually and I do enjoy the food here. The service is great and quick, but I really feel like it needs a major major upgrade. It's been the same for years, and that's just it, its the basic chinese food spot, so I can't really hate on it, because sometimes i do just crave the basics, but the inside def needs a reno, unless your cool with the basics. I steer towards take out when I go here, the atmosphere does not draw me to stay and eat."}
{"text":"The service may not be friendly, and some certain food might not be tasty. But if you're Filipino OR going to a potluck.  try a tray of chicken wings for 25 bucks. There's so much of it and they are so good!"}
