{"text":"If you want microwaved poutine or cold food, this is the place to come!  We were unhappy with the fact out appetizer came last and the meal was cold to add as well.  Then at the end i am told that the bill does not include a tip is just icing on the cake"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night, and I am already planning my next visit. I had the chicken and spicy lamb kafta combo. The plate arrived with a side of simple yet delicious white basmati rice. The meat was juicy and tasty.  In terms of tenderness, it was the chocolate of cooked kabab. Soft in my mouth while energizing my taste bites, the texture and the spices were unforgettable. As an appetiser, we had the equally savoury bowl of okra with tomato sauce. Ever since my visit here, my stomach has been growling for more."}
{"text":"We had the beef koubideh which was very good. I also liked the lentil soup."}
{"text":"We arrived last night from mississauga and we found this resturant in yelp  , the resturant were croyded we were a party of seven the dishes we ordered it comes with either soup or salad the food were fresh very tasty and the portion is very big . For the crowed the resturant had I think it was a bit under staffed since it took some time . But diffenlty I will come again"}
{"text":"My bf has eaten here so many times that I think I know the menu by heart. Food is good, service isn't bad, place is quite large."}
{"text":"The place was excellent , very reasonable prices - food varieties are a lot you can find any Lebanese - Persian and other Middle eastern dishes .  Place is clean service is excellent everybody smiles to you there, they accepted my crazy request to customize my order I couldn't believe how they act professionally and  were very happy to do it for me, Halal 100% and I met 2 of my friend who were visiting from New York, it seems that everybody comes to this place - I can't believe it. Within this few blocks  in this area this is the No. 1"}
{"text":"Worst quality ever The only reason why they are still open it because of their community present close to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Good food and very filling, but I prefer Afghan kabob. The lentil soup is yummy, but not the best I've ever tasted. Go here if you're hungry and need a kabob fix."}
{"text":"Good service, food was mediocre. The pita bread seemed to be old and smelled funky. Wouldn't go back to eat there again. There are plenty of places around the area and would try something new. Saint Alexandre has plenty, just don't go here."}
{"text":"I took my family to Chateau Kabab for Iftar. We ordered mix platter 43 and the fasolia dish. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of the food ( we were so hungry lol). Food was fresh and tasty. The platter certainly looks bigger on the picture. The waiter forgot to bring our second part of the order. Still, service was alright given it was very busy for Iftar. It was nice to see they invested on some interior decor. 10% is charged for tips. It would be nice if they mentioned it somewhere in the menu. In case the person behind the counter forgets to mention that part."}
{"text":"Food and portions here are great. Don't be off put by presentation (pretty basic tbh) but food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I didn't like their food at all. Maybe because I was comparing it to the Persian food I normally have here in Toronto. I ordered the mixed plate (1 Beef Kebab Skewer, and 1 Chicken Skewer) along with my friend who ordered the same thing. Although fresh the food lacked taste. The prices were decent at $11.99 for the platter. The place was packed and family oriented on the Saturday evening. The decor was interesting here and was what lured us to this place from the pictures on their website. I had the lentil soup that came with the pita (as the pre-meal option between soup or salad). Ironically I ordered this by accident, since I couldn't understand his french accent when he asked me for soup or salad I heard do you want the \"super-salad\" and affirmed it. Later I discovered what I had ordered. This was not a negative though as I was open to trying new things. Their pita was your regular pita cut up (not warmed up). Normally in persian restaurants in Toronto they make you fresh naan style breads here when they serve you a platter for $11.99. Nonetheless this place was one of our experiences in Montreal."}
{"text":"Omg so I love Persian food and have tried tons of places but this by far was the best place that I have gone too! The meats were cooked so well wirh the perfect seasoning and the waiter was amazing ! Will def recommend to anyone who wants authentic great tasting Mediterranean food . Their lentil soup was also very good"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a rip off. Food was too expensive! You could find cheaper prices from other middle eastern restaurants. Hospitality is also bad! I had to wait for an hour for my food, and the staff did not even care!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offer a mix of Persian and Arabic menus. Compared to similar places it is less expensive though. The staff are friendly and helpful. I tried Koobideh beef and it was acceptable. A bit salty I say but not irritating! The food comes with a choice of soup or salad.  You can order dessert and tea if you'd like to. The desserts are mainly Arabic (sweeet !)  The place itself is so simple but clean and inviting. There's no music and most of the time you can watch soccer on TVs there! Not loud however.   If you plan a party and want to serve some kebab they have an option by which you can by a kilo of koobideh say and it is cheaper than ordering equivalent number of sticks. This is not the place for a date or family weekend getaway but a grab-plenty-of-good-food-for-less place where you can have lunch in your break at work or order out and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"The only reason i put 2 stars is because the food really is good and fair priced.  What REALLY bothered me was one particular SNEAKY Incident and that's why i'm even writing a review. My boyfriend and I normally always get the same thing so we know how much its supposed to cost. One time, we go to pay and the bill was higher so my boyfriend asked why it was say 45. The guy just looked at us and didn't answer and then turned around to do something else as we were wondering. We didn't wanna make it a big deal and assumed prices just went up so we just paid Visa. The machine asked us how much tip, all good, we enter a tip %.  When we left, i looked at the receipt in the car and that's when we realized the guy had ALREADY charged us 15% for tip/service fee on the initial amount WITHOUT telling us and then when we paid by Visa, we paid an EXTRA 15% of tip. When we asked why the amount was so high, he purposely did not answer and pretended he didn't hear. It is simply sketchy as hell and i was very pissed off so be careful when you go there and do look at your receipts."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food delivery service in Montréal. Arrives so warm and the food is so delicious and never fails to impress. I recommend the saffron chicken. That is one of the best chicken I've had. With their amazing rice. I wish I knew how to cook rice like that!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a Shawarma fix and this place hit the spot.  I had the chicken beef combo.  It was well done, filling and served quickly.  I would definitely come back and likely try the kabobs next!"}
{"text":"great place , i loved the food here almost coming twice a day now - i'm addicted to this place , Persian, Lebanese all other middle eastern food,  the menu have 52 dishes I can't believe it - this is a most go place, Clean Halal 100% prices are very good the best in the area you must try the Shawrma, the Butin and other Persian dishes  thank you chateau Kabab i was lucky to try it !"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food, Great service and wonderful ambience. The menu is very reasonable and kid friendly. There is something for everyone in the family. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Even though I go to Concordia I don't think I would have had the pleasure of visiting this place had an Iranian friend had not taken me here.   Food was absolutely delicious. Tried the chicken, beef, and sirloin kababs and all were yummy  pieces of smoky, juicy, and tasty goodness. The rice that came with the kababs was like crack. It was buttery and fragrant and enough of it that I think I could have split my plate with another person. The lentil soup that came with our meals was forgettable, but that's ok.   Decent prices, very good food."}
{"text":"It's pretty decent food, a blend of Persian and Arabic cuisine. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and there is a variety of options to choose from, I personally liked the kebabs and its 100% halal for those peeps with dietary restrictions!"}
{"text":"I like this place but I'm not crazy about it.   The food was good and the service was great.   The only thing I didn't like about this place is the payment. You need to go to the cashier to pay. The restaurant is big and looked good but they need to step up a lil bit to be great restaurant"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place! I heard their kababs are the best! We were hanging around Concordia; so I asked my friend if we can go there; my friend has been here few times.   Nothing fancy inside. Regular tables and chairs. Water in plastic glasses.   I took the lunch special. I had lentil soup with pita bread. It was absolutely marvelous! Then I got the mix kabab (lamb and beef) plate. Two pieces of kabab, one tiny roasted tomatoes and too much of rice. The kababs were delicious but very oily. I was little saddened of lack of vegetables with the dish.   Service was great and quick!   I was happy to finally to eat at Château Kabab!"}
{"text":"Mixed kabab plate should be renamed, \"bland indifference plate.\"  Though the rice, tomato and the kebabs looked very good, everything lacked flavor.  (It was like eating with a condom on my tongue.)"}
{"text":"This is a great local place run by very friendly people.  I'm originally from Detroit, so my standards for Middle Eastern food is pretty high because, at one time, Metro-Detroit had the largest population of Middle Eastern people outside of the Middle East.  I was impressed!  I had a super tasty Iraqi style kabab, and the tea was plentiful and delicious.  I wasn't even concerned with the price, but it was affordable since I got the special.  It looks like a popular place for students, but it wasn't loud or anything like that, just a cool and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"My tour of food in Montreal continues w some tasty middle eastern fare. Loved the koobideh and the hummous. Of course the rice was delicious. Perfect for lunch!"}
{"text":"Very average middle eastern food. I came in for an early dinner- the entire restaurant was empty and I had to ask to be seated. I ordered the mixed grill plate. He asked if I wanted salad to start and although I asked for an israeli salad, he gave me a very sloppy plate of romaine and cucumber drenched in white sauce. My beef kebab was average at best and so was the chicken (although slightly more juicy). It came with a soda but my total cost was close to $18. It also took forever for me to get my bill. I literally had to flag a waiter down to check on me. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Generous portions, tender juicy kabobs & great service. You can do half rice & half salad & the plates come with side of lentil soup."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for delicious middle eastern food and were not disappointed! The environment was casual with a simple but cute decor. The portions are large (we did two people per main kebab dish) with a few appetizers and that was perfect. Food was amazing! My friends and I enjoyed it very much and when we return to Montreal will definitely stop here!"}
{"text":"Pretty close to my home and the university. Food is great and my favorite order is Zereshk Polo (no. 22). Must try their daily soup, perfect with pita. Highly recommended but I still don't if it's the Iranian restaurant or the Lebanese restaurant??"}
{"text":"I like the food here. Been here twice and it was good both times. My wife used to go to Concordia, so she loves this place. Came here for dinner and got a chicken shawarama plate. Very big and fresh and tasty. The price was fair too. I wish it was seasoned a little bit more, but still pretty decent. I always get the poutine here as well and it was okay. Everything is halal so that is a plus. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Kebabs were subpar, both in terms of taste and quality. The serving sizes are quite big and that's the only positive thing I have to say about it."}
{"text":"The food portions are humongous and halal. Its location on Guy Street is very convenient. I've tried most of the main dish platters and they're all delicious. The dishes consist of mostly rice and meat with salad or soup on the side. The soups are not great so take the salad but don't fill up on it - the main dish size is a handful. The main dishes's rice is fragrant and the meats are moist and tasty.   The large meal platters are huge and can be easily shared between 10 people at least."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite and ordered their Lentil Soup with Pita and a Special which had Chicken & Beef Kebab with Rice. We also ordered some Hummus on the side. The location is great, but the restaurant is very basic. It's good for a quick bite or take away.  However the service made up for the basic space as they are friendly, quick and very accommodating.  Food is surprisingly excellent especially the Kebabs!! And inexpensive.  Will definitely drop by again, when in the area next time!"}
{"text":"I'll make this short sweet. This was a great restaurant. Food, pricing, ambience, customer service = fantastic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is alright for the price.... The service is very slow.. try their beef, cuz their chicken is too dried."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at this place. It's right by Concordia University. The prices are reasonable and the food was delicious. I had the shawarma and it was amazing. I ordered it with the roasted potatoes and it came with this garlic creamy sauce that was absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"Chateau kabab is our fav middle eastern restaurant, be it the downtown or west island location we are always satisfied. The variety (heavy or light plates) is definately there, the owners are very humble and grateful, they always go an extra mile to satisfy all your needs. Iranian and lebanese food under one roof makes it the best place for taking friends and family out for a dinner - we are positive that everybody will find a meal to their satisfaction! The complimentary tea is always fresh and tasty and keeps the conversation going on the table :) Highly highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ce petit restaurant spécialisé en cuisine iranienne et irakienne situé à quelques pas de l'Université Concordia est une adresse à retenir. Non seulement la bouffe y est délicieuse, mais les portions sont très généreuses et les prix sont peu élevés. Les assiettes de Falafel ou de Taboulé sont bonnes, mais on peut en trouver dans n'importe quel restaurant halal. Si vous vous vous attablez chez Chateau Kabab, autrefois connu sous le nom de Chateaubriand, il faut absuloment commander leurs assiettes de brochettes d'inspiration iraniennes, qui sont accompagnée d'une grande portion de riz. Le tout est bien assaisonné et je dois dire qu'on a le ventre rempli si on réussit à manger tout le contenu de notre assiette."}
{"text":"Always fresh and I do recommend in downtown montreal the lentil soup is unique and great to start with and the Mix grills are fabulous."}
{"text":"Their lamb kefta is the best. I tried other things but only the lamb kefta is what I liked. Their bread too is very fresh and baked at their end. They are super expensive compared to what they are offering. In kebabs restaurants usually you get the salads and tehine with the meal and especially if you are buying 1kg of a specific meat. But they never provide that in their meals, which is weird to such a type of restaurants. The ambiance is so kitschy I recommend to get it delivered to you or to just take out, no ambiance whatsoever. Recommended for their lamb kefta"}
{"text":"My friend ordered to go and as usual, I was not disappointed. There are alot of kabab places in montreal but Chateau Kabab is amongst the top ones. Their Guy location is extremely convenient and the one is west island has a nice seating. Yes it is extremely cheap for the portion you get, I don't understand people that complain about the salad when you get it including your meal, any other restaurant would charge it as an entré.  It took a while for us to get the food but again when they're super busy, it`s quite understandable. The Kabab is super juicy and the shawarma is great as well. Overall, I recommend it :)"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for 2 days and are here 3 times because they're just that good! My kids were craving home style food and we devoured their delicious lentil soup, salad with yogurt herb dressing, their hummus with the most fragrant olive oil and allllllll their kabobs!! The saffron chicken with bone and the beef shish kabob were our favorites but they are all delicious! We had the okra stew too and it was phenomenal. I don't think you can go wrong with your choice here, everything was fresh and full of flavor! We loved it!! Yum I'm salivating thinking about our meal"}
{"text":"Best Persian kebabs in town! The atmosphere and hospitality reminded me of the middle east. The food was also 100% authentic! So fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for a quick bite. It's at an amazing location, near the metro and Concordia! The actual place is 2 floors. The second floor is beautifully renovated. The main floor is more for pickups with a few tables. We asked if we can sit upstairs but we were told we couldn't. After a few minutes another staff came and asked if we would like to go up; at this point we were settled in so we just stayed downstairs.   They're food is great! Never have I been disappointed even during my uni days. They staff very polite, respectful and friendly. The service is great and the price is reasonable.   We ordered the midi special; chicken and beef kabab plate. I loved the lentil soup which was served with pita. The meat was well cooked and seasoned served on onions. There was a lot of rice which I couldn't finish. There wasn't enough veggies. I would definitely go back in the future!"}
{"text":"I found this place through the Yelp app when I visited Canada. We had gone to the museum and wanted to get something to eat walking distance. They serve sheesh kobobs and Mediterranean food, plus the pictures looked nice. We got there and the place looked a little shady from the outside, We almost left, but it was cold, and we were already  there so, what the heck? I'm so glad we didn't leave, the food was amazing!! And so cheap, it was such a treat. We ordered a full meal combo that came with soup, salad, rice, fries, rice, humus (fresh!) pita and kebobs. It was amazing. Our server was efficient. He didn't speak English that well, but was able to take our order. Food came fast. Decor was not quite as pretty as it looks in the pictures, but it was clean and cozy. Lighting and angles are everything LOL, but do give this place a try if you're in the area, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent... the staff was very nice but everything took forever. I think they were understaffed. I would eat there again but It wasn't to die for..."}
{"text":"MTL blog says that this is the one kebab place that you must check out in all of Montréal so my sister and I went there while we were in town. There is an upstairs and a downstairs and we got seated upstairs.   The host was super friendly but the server was a bit curt. Also, service was pretty slow. It took quite a while to get up to the table and get the drinks and everything else. The food itself was good. Not the best kebabs I have ever had but I lived in Germany and guess that I am more of a fan of Turkish/German/Belgian style than Iraqi style? We also got baba ghanouj (their spelling not mine) and it was good/ok. Maybe I should have gotten something else off the menu because it was all just good/ok. Finally we realized the server was not going to bring a bill (never mentioned it nor did he ever visit the table after dropping off the food) so we went downstairs and paid. Yes it was good but I would advise sitting downstairs and maybe not sticking to the basics as it seems there are many better things to eat than the kebabs."}
{"text":"Honestly did not have a good experience. The service was good but the food was pretty bad. Got a #30 and the meal was overpriced, the meat tasted and looked fake, and they give you a mountain of tasteless rice to fill your plate. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  An extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as 'Masgoof.'  If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.  In most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.  The interiors and décor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.  Hats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet."}
{"text":"What's up with all these good reviews? This place is horrible.  Ordered kababs which turned out to be disgusting and undercooked (blood leaking from the kababs). We request that the kababs be cooked a little more and the owner Hassan screams ''I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 7 YEARS. I KNOW HOW THESE KEBABS ARE SUPPOSE TO LOOK.'   We are like \"hmmm Sir, we don't want raw kababs\".   More screaming, this time ....\"I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS KABAB, YOU ARE STILL GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR MEAL. YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING NOT TO PAY FOR YOUR MEAL.\"   Wow! Really? When did we say we weren't going to pay?  Oh and family and I were there for a mother's day lunch. The owner made my mum cry....not cool."}
{"text":"I really love this place, it's a classic kabob restaurant. The meat and the rice are always perfectly cooked and sooo good! The meat is always juicy and well flavoured.  I always take the dish with two different kabob choices, one chicken and one spicy meat!   They have the best lentil soup, it tastes perfection.  The staff are nice too, and most importantly, it's pretty cheap   Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of my plate, I was there to break my fast 2 days ago so I didn't think about taking a picture I was too hungy!"}
{"text":"Delicious shawarma - if not the best shawarma I've ever had. We got the mixed platter with chicken and beef. So tasty and the garlicey hummus rocks! The green salad that comes with it is also amazing. I wish I lived in Montreal so I can eat here more often. One of the best and the busyness of this place proves the food here is delicious!"}
{"text":"Allot of food for little bit of money ! Chateau kabab is great for family dinner, late night snack, lunch break, catering etc, the variety on their menu from persian to iraqi food from sandwich to plate to family platters ! Their menu is adapted to all type of gatherings, the food is so tasty the spices are authentic, from the white colored chicken seasoned with garlic to the yellow colored chicken marinated with saffron, Chateau Kabab is the destination for very hungry people .. If you cant finish it you can make it your lunch for tomorrow :)!! Their fries are crispy, their rice is very nice and perfumed, their meats are grilled to perfection ! The hummus and garlic sauce to me seens like made from scratch compared to allot of places where canned hummus is served ! Their salad is very simple not fancy at all but the ingredients used are very fresh and crunchy just love it !! Their soup especially in winter is to die for, by adding some \"sumak\" (pomegrenade powder) you will actually enhance its taste ! On the weekends it can get pretty loud so not ideal for a date but with a group of friends or family i give you my green light ! You will not ruin yourself and you wont regret it !"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here. I used to go to Concordia and had a Lebanese friend in the area who introduced me to this place otherwise I would have never dared step inside. Seems like a lot of students and middle eastern diners come here. I've been a few times and can't ever recall seeing much mixed ethnicities. Chateau Kabab doesn't branch out to the whole population I find, and even when I brought my caucasian friends, their first impression was with raised eyebrows.  They had a makeover in recent years although it is still by no means a fancy place, despite the nice walls, gold touches and lighting - it's more fast foody.  I've had their Okra and Fasolia dishes, which are kind of like beef chili and bean stews in tomato soup, served with basmati rice, pita breads and salad. You get all that for around 11$. Portions are generous. It's a delicious hearty meal made with simple ingredients, I can't picture anyone not liking this dish. When I came with my boyfriend he ordered meat skewers or kabads, did not enjoy it, and never wanted to come back.  I would recommend for a simple lunch, they also do delivery. No frills, no complaint kind of place. Tasty food and very affordable prices. The do have a website complete with menu and prices http://www.chateaukabab.com/index.php"}
{"text":"Absolutely HUGE portions for the price for Lebanese & Persian food. It still boggles my mind how inexpensive some of the Persian dishes are here. Very tasty. Nice interior decor (2nd floor). Quick and courteous service. A sure bet."}
{"text":"Wow! We found this place on google and thanks to Yelp. Looking for halal close to our hotel we decided to give this one a try. Thanks fellow yelpers!! This hidden gem was just what we wanted. The food here is so tasty and delicious! Their rice have taste on their own, their chicken was so tasteful. The service, the food, all of it was just amazing. Definitely try this out if you are close to it."}
{"text":"I would leave less stars if I could.  Worst Persian food I've ever had.  Nothing was fresh, and if I wasn't as so hungry, I would  have left it all and refused to pay.  The four star reviews are totally inaccurate.  Hope I'm not sick from this meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great location! I absolutely love the lentil soup that they have and also a few other dishes. The bread is just average, but other things are great. The average meal portion is great too. It is very reasonably priced and the service is very adequate. I went here for dinner when I was hungry and my stomach was quite satisfied after the meal. I really recommend the lamb dish, lentil soup or chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the good reviews, but the experience was anything but five star. I wanted to give one star but the decor is really nice.  The soup was old and cold. Too much white rice without much taste. It would taste much better with some spices.   I asked for a mixed kafta but one of the brochette is old for sure. You can tell the difference between the two brochette from the look and smell. I asked the waiter why they are different but did not care much.   It might be my bad luck or their bad day. However, I do not think I will bet on another chance."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant if you want to try iraqien cuisine in downtown of Montréal and close to Concordia University , the service was very good because we reserved a table for 3 people by the phone using this application , the food (chicken BBQ , rice, salad and appetizer ) was very tasty."}
{"text":"The food is halal so its a more ethical appropriate place to eat meat. The serving are generous. The waiters are attentive   I love the gold and white decor.  The bathrooms are clean. Part of the kitchen is visible. There is a decent seafood option.   If you are dinning in . I suggest to have tea before the meal and to ask for some lemon.  I had the fish options . salmon and tilapia and they were both great. I prefer the Dahl soup over the salad. I feel the rice is better than the fries .    The dessert options are also a good option . I like this restaurant because upstairs is nice and quiet which gives me a break from the crazy downtown lifestyle ."}
{"text":"My go to Lebanese take out, I've never actually been inside the restaurant. Their online ordering is so easy and efficient, and they deliver really fast"}
{"text":"Outstanding kebob and shawarma. some of the best in city. Thats a lot for a city with dozens of choices in a few blocks"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner. Place was packed but we made reservations, luckily: I recommend doing so. Food was definitely 5 stars. Everything was amazing, I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken koobideh and my husband could not complain either.. he had some sort of beef kabob (fillet mignon I believe). The price is very reasonable considering the quality of the food you're getting. The service was great.. employees are welcoming and joyful.   Lost a star because I'm not a big fan of the atmosphere, although I'm sure this place caters to Concordia's student body... I wish it were ... cozier?"}
