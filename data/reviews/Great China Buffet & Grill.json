{"text":"great lunch spot. decent selection with an odd setup"}
{"text":"Some foods were really good: pepper steak, sesame chicken, egg rolls, crab legs, etc.  Some food you could tell wasn't so good (cake desserts, very crusty sweet n sour chicken).  Overall, there were more positives than negatives.  The service from our waiter was outstanding (very nice and fast).  We had a good time and will return."}
{"text":"I went there during lunch and i was very suprised at how the layout was. Fantastic. I love sushi so i figured i would go here sushi and so much more great service A++++ Prices are very resonable!"}
