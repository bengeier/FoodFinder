{"text":"Best cornbread and potato salad in pittsburgh. No matter what you eat you must try those"}
{"text":"Seen this place a couple of times  finally went In , and I gotta say the food was pretty amazing. The babe back ribs were tender an delicious , the greens were good an juicy, the Mac an cheese was ok but the corn bread muffins were to die for ! We also got fried chicken which was most defiantly finger licking good hshaha ! But how ever we also got the smoked ribs , I was so hungry when I seen the pictures of the beef ribs but it ended up being no meat on the bones what so ever. Also liked that I called in an they had no problem making portions for me an my family . Over all we were excited to eat here an give it a 9 /10 . On a side note I wish I knew the whole me u I would have got sweet potatoes an a few other things that I'm sure would have been delicious"}
{"text":"Great food.  We saw the write up in CP and went to give it a try.  It looks like they are mostly doing take-out, even though there are several tables to eat in.  We did take out but will probably eat in next time.  Very clean inside and staff was friendly.  We sampled most of the menu.  Ribs were fall off the bone and the sauce was very tasty (I did the mild).  The fried chicken wings were crisp and tasty, too.  We did Mac n cheese, baked beans, potato salad and collards and all were delicious.  My husband loved the corn bread muffins.  All in all, this place is legit and we will be sure to return.  Great addition to Brookline!"}
{"text":"I frequently get take out from Bama's. These ribs are as good as any in Pittsburgh, the chicken wings are really tasty, and the sweet potato casserole is my favorite thing on the menu. Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Located right on Brookline Blvd, with plenty of street parking is Bama's. It has been my mission to try everything on the menu and so far it's been an awesome experience.  The ribs are huge and have always been cooked perfectly. The pulled pork and brisket have been amazing and you can't go wrong with the mustard sauce. For sides I would recommended the red beans and rice, fresh cut fries or jambalaya. The mac and cheese and potato salad are just average. My only complaint is sometimes they close earlier than the posted hours."}
{"text":"This new place in Brookline is a gem...Very friendly family run establishment... By far some of the best ribs and chicken that I have ever had... Their greens and beans & rice are on point...From a price point for what you get is a very good value... I am very happy and stuffed customer... You should give Bama's a try, they won't disappoint.... The owners said that their website will be up soon but I am glad there are sites like Yelp that allow me to discover new places... I will be going back for seconds soon..."}
{"text":"Must try little gem in the south hills of Pittsburgh! Ribs are awesome... If you get wings try the mustard sauce."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Bama's a better nod, but a few things prevented me from tipping my vote to above par.  Went to Bama's on a rainy Saturday afternoon and my wife and I walked into an empty joint.  We were promptly greeted and the place smelt great, so we immediately had some high hopes (particularly given the positive Yelp and PG reviews).  Unfortunately, that's where things started to slip a bit.  I'm a sucker for beef ribs.  I'll say it.  So I was disappointed to hear they are only offered on certain days/times when I attempted to order them (the menu failed to mention this).  Not to be discouraged, I figured I'd sooth the wound with a bit of sweet potato casserole, but again, no luck...  out.  At this point, I just wanted some grub, so we decided to order the rib combo plate.  Six ribs, mac & cheese and double corn bread muffins.  The ribs - these were perhaps the biggest disappointment.  While the looked the part (big, juicy and smoked) they definitely didn't play it.  Chewy, fatty, a lack a bark and overall I found myself not really looking to finish them.  One positive is they did have probably the most intense smoke flavor I've tasted (not always a good thing though)  The mac - nothing special here.  The noodles were overdone and kind of reminded my of a dryer version of Stouffers  The corn bread - a saving grace here.  Definitely some of the better corn bread I've had in the city (moist, sweet and crisp on the edges)  (Bonus) The spicy sauce - another plus here.  Sweet and spicy, I found myself mopping the remains on the place with every ounce of corn bread I had  Maybe we just got a bad rack, but I'm hoping to try and give it another shot in the future."}
{"text":"I have been on a Yelp hiatus as of late due to external factors, but Bama's southern kitchen made me return to sing their praises. I feel an obligation to make sure places like Bama's endure and become widely known to the Pgh area and get the credit they deserve for making tummies happy in the 412.  I am a sucker for good Southern food for my belly. You name it, greens, biscuits and gravy, fried chicken, ribs, basically everything that would make a cardiac specialist cringe  We ventured in to see very gratified patrons, most on a first name basis with the staff. The menu is very succinct, consisting of burger options, wings, sides, and RIBS.  My girlfriend ordered their special, a brisket sandwich, and I ordered 6 ribs. I confidently exclaimed to the staff that a growing man such as myself should have no trouble putting that away. We had sides of Macaroni, red beans and rice, and greens. I have tried ribs many places, the Carolinas, Oklahoma, etc. These were without a doubt my favorite. The smokiness and dry rub alone could make the need for sauce an afterthought. They were extremely meaty and filling. In fact, I failed on my claim and was only able to eat four. They did however come with two sauces to dip in, a mustard, and spicy sauce. They were ungodly delicious. The sides were as wholesome as you would expect from a family picnic and every bit as tasty as well.  If you are craving delicious ribs or comfort food, this gem of Brookline should be your jam."}
{"text":"We just left this place and both of us are so stuffed. We literally barely spoke to each other because we could not put down this food. It's really that good lol. The owners were very friendly and the space is very cozy.  I cannot stress enough how good this place was. Best I've had since moving from VA 3 years ago."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday for lunch with my father.  We are both fans of BBQ and so I was excited whenever I noticed this place come up on Yelp.  The outside of this place is pretty inconspicous along Brookline Blvd although right now they still have a grand opening sign outside.  The inside though is warm and inviting and you can tell that they have put a lot of work into it.    As soon as we entered the restaurant we noticed a sign that said please wait to be seated.  After waiting there for about a minute one of the cooks came over to us and told us to ignore the sign and we took a seat at one of the tables.  Overall this place can maybe hold 20 people or so.  The menus were already on the table and whenever I looked at them I was actually a bit surprised to see that they only had ribs and wings, no pulled pork or brisket here.  Beyond that they also had some burgers and a variety of sides.  Ultimately both my father and I decided on one of the combo's which included 3 ribs, 2 wings, 2 small sides and a cornbread for $12.  For my sides I decided on the Mac and Cheese and Greens while my father went with the potato salad and sweet potato casserole.  We also were given a achoice between the mild, spicy and mustard sauces.  Since I enjoy different kinds of sauces I chose both the spicy and mustard.  After only a short wait our food came out looking pretty good, especially my dad's sweet potato casserole which was topped with marshmallows.  The ribs were large and the chicken wings were whole wings.  I first tried the ribs without the sauce and found them to be tasty although I couldn't taste any smoke on them.  They were tender though and easily fell of the bone. The wings were also pretty good and were cooked up perfectly.  The breading was cripsy and had a good flavor while the chicken inside of it was hot and juicy.  I enjoyed both the ribs and the wings in both of the sauces.  The mustard sauce reminded me of a good carolina sauce while the spicy sauce had a little bit of a zing at the end but nothing too hot.  Finally after I was done with my meats I dug into the mac and cheese which was pretty good for a BBQ joint.  Lastly I tried the greens.  I can't say that they were my favorite as they still had all of their bitterness to them and they didn't seem to be seasoned too well.  The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  Overall I thought that the food was worthy of 4 stars and whenever I queried my dad, he felt the same.  What pushed them up to the 5 stars is that I could tell that staff really cared about the restaurant and that they were nice while doing all that they could for us"}
{"text":"The older I get, I appreciate a smaller, concise menu. Don't get me wrong - choices are great and variety is welcome. However, restaurants with tailored menus tend to do those dishes exceptionally well. This is true with Bama's. The ribs were moist, tender and flavorful. My wife's wings were large, crispy and meaty.   Save room for the sides. As many others have discussed the Mac 'n cheese is tasty. For me, the collards are amazing. You need to understand that I am pure carnivore, but I finished my veggies for the first time in ... well, a long time.     My only minor criticism was the silverskin membrane that remained during cooking. Honestly, I didn't mind it (too much), but personally prefer it removed.   Very well done Bama's. We look forward to many more meals."}
{"text":"It's okay, they try very hard to put out a consistent product and make sure your happy. But I don't think they do the volume to really be consistent with ribs. Mine were falling off the bone and the Mrs weren't well cooked. Corn bread is amazing, red beans and rice was decent, Mac n cheese could use some help, the cook needs to learn to make a rue."}
{"text":"Weeks ago, I had been cruising down Brookline Boulevard and was dismayed that Tisha's Sunny Farms had apparently been displaced by a new restaurant. However, when I noticed that it had been replaced by a Southern eatery, I was intrigued, eagerly anticipating its grand, grand opening. When Mother's Day was upon us, my dear mum exclaimed \"Bama's! Bama's!\" when asked about her meal, and Dad and I took care of the rest.   Bama's interiors are modestly appointed, but their food is anything but, generously served and living large on plates and in bellies.   The beautifully bark-laden (St. Louis?) Pork Ribs (Bama's also offers Beef Ribs) we ordered for our takeout feast might as well have come from a barbecued brontosaurus. Smoked with an exquisite subtlety, succulent as the greatest of steaks, and as fatty and tender as the night is long, the amount of meat on each bone was astonishing and astonishingly appetizing. I almost felt as if they needed no sauce to compliment them, until I got a taste of their stingin' honey mustard and their sassy cherry red \"mild\" sauces, both kicking my taste nodules into orbit with their loud flavors  Bama's taught me love. They taught me to love sweet potatoes, their casserole taking on a pie-like quality that had me wishing I'd saved them for an after-dinner treat.   They taught me to love mac 'n cheese, Bama's being fluffy, ethereal, wigglin', jigglin', and bold with cheddar bite.   Bama's potato salad is a buttery, golden quagmire of savoriness and texture. As a connoisseur of this staple of cookouts and picnics, Bama's ranks as a top 5 contender, pushing Grandma's off to the corner forever.   Again, recalling dessert in the same manner as the Sweet Potato Casserole, the Cornbread Muffins would have fooled me into thinking them to be cupcakes if a cream cheese icing had been applied or a strawberry shortcake if the juicy, crimson fruit and whipped cream accompanied them. Dense and sweet, no condiments were necessary.   This brings us to the proper dessert offerings in the Apple Crisp and the Peach Cobbler. Served in deep cups, the molten, chunky fillings in each were complimented by the kind of sugary, crunchy coating/crust that rules bake sales nationwide and begs for vanilla ice cream.   That Bama's is not yet another Boulevard pizza parlor is commendable.   That Bama's was being deluged by customers when we arrived to pick up our food was encouraging.   That Bama's is serving up supremely tasty Southern cooking in Brookline is a miracle.  P.S. As I write this, my family and I are lethargic from the amount of pork we consumed. Gorged and happy we are, and the leftovers are plentiful, Bama's unsparing portions positively spoiling us."}
{"text":"Delicious fried wings.  Very good ribs.  The spicy sauce is spicy but not overly spicy. Cornbread muffins were oh so good!  The mac & cheese was pretty standard and OK.  The sweet potato casserole was to sweet for me but others liked it.  The staff was super nice and friendly.    Now we have 2 good BBQ places in the neighborhood!  YEA!"}
{"text":"I kept seeing it here on Yelp as a new business, and finally had the opportunity to go and check it out. Easy to find in Brookline, only about a block from Las Palmas, so the GPS lead us right to it.  We were greeted by an incredibly sweet and pleasant older woman who guided we newbies through 'how it worked' and took our beverage order. I wasn't sure what to expect before walking in, but the place kind of has the feel of a renovated ice cream parlor or donut shop. Glass display cases and counter, and tables to seat maybe 20 people. Very plain and clean, no kitsch and no frills.   The menu is VERY limited, and in my opinion a little pricey. They basically have ribs (pork, or you can order beef), fried chicken wings, burgers, sides, and combos of those. They offer three sauces for the meats, spicy, mild, or mustard.  My friend and I both ordered the 4 bone, 8 wing and one side combo for $16 each.  The wings were a little small and not very meaty, but when they first came out piping hot, the flavor was excellent. Nicely seasoned breading, and good either plain or dipped in the spicy sauce. As they cooled off, they kind of lost their charm (and the meat seemed to shrink down a bit) so they ended up in a box to come home.   I chose the side of mac n cheese and my friend the sweet potato casserole, and though both portions were again a little small for the price point, they were very tasty.  Then came the meat.   Four ribs. This is where they caught me. I am generally not a huge rib fan because even though they may be delicious and the sauces creatively conjured, there is usually just not enough meat to warrant the price or to fill me up. That was NOT the case here. The ribs were VERY meaty, tender and beautifully cooked, and the spicy sauce was an excellent topper. I can eat spicy sauce that would burn off the faces of most who cringe at the thought of a jalapeno, and for me this was somewhere in between. It did not burn MY tongue, but did kick my sinuses into heavy flow. So if you feel that a single red pepper flake is the end of the world, you might want to go with the mild - but if you REALLY like it spicy hot, you might find this spicy to be mild. My spice gauge found it more toward mild, but it was definitely filled with flavor, and did have a light kick.  Our server was perfect. She kind of made you feel like you'd been invited to the party by a friend of her family, and she was going to make sure you enjoyed yourself and felt at home. And she really did.   I've giving four of the five stars basically for the pricing. Had the chicken wings been a bit meatier, they might have not seemed so off at about $1 each. The mac n cheese could have also been a half spoonful bigger to make it seem a little more 'wow'. The final bill for the two combos and two sodas came to about $35, and I generally cringe at that price tag in a big bloated atmosphere driven hyped bistroid. This was kind of a somewhat fast food atmosphere with that price ticket.  I was very curious why they only have fried chicken WINGS, and not full fried chicken. With their seasoning and some actual chicken thighs and legs, a side of home made mashed taters...mmmmmmmm.   I'm not sure that I would become a regular, but when I'm in the mood for good ribs, this would definitely be the first place I think of. But I might just stick to a slab or half slab, instead of playing with the sides.  It's definitely a nice addition to an already unique and eclectic neighborhood strip."}
{"text":"Wow. That's the first word that comes to mind. The second is finger licking good. The third is, when can I go back!?  I realize there's a great debate on what's better BBQ in Pittsburgh, but I honestly think there's an array of different kinds, that can range from good to mediocre. This is definitely on the good end!  I got the meal of 3 ribs, 2 wings and 2 sides. Momma came HUNGRY! But really I just chalk it up to the ribs and wings not being much meat.   The ribs were great. I tried the beef ribs, so while two had a decent amount of meat on them, one did not. But the smoked flavor itself ALMOST warranted no sauce. Almost. But that's just because I love sauce too much... I couldn't not have it. And the mild sauce I tried was the right combo of spicy and sweet. I thought the wings were good, but had very little meat on it. The breaking was really good though. How do you choose between meat and breading?  The sides were all great too. I split 2 other sides with a friend as well. Usually there's always a mix of good and bad, but all were good. I think the best was the sweet potato casserole. It tasted like pie, it was just incredible! The greens were great and the cornbread was too. Usually I find cornbread dry, so I was happy this wasn't. The only two that were okay were the mac n cheese and beans, but they weren't bad by any means.  This is gonna be my new spot for BBQ in my area for sure! If you don't live around here, it's still WELL worth the drive here!"}
