{"text":"Excellent. I'm an Italian food snob..Cucina is awesome!   One of the best indicators to me is a simple cappelini.. No meat,  no fuss,  just great pasta and sauce. Cucina has one of the best.   This is honestly one of the best places for authentic American Italian. I hate overcooked pasta..The pasta here is made fresh (I asked),  and not overcooked (good bite). Also,  Cucina is great for vegetarians,  or pescaterians...plenty of non meat or seafood options.    Service is good. We sat at the bar,  and had Abel....one of the most personable and accommodating servers I've had.   I do not really like to give places 5 stars,  but I think Cucina deserves it."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service. Thank you Dominique!!  3 stars for the food (at least for me). BF loved the Kobe burger, would've given that a 5 for sure. I had the seafood pasta, super mediocre. Supposed to be with lobster in a lobster sauce. Didn't really find any lobster but a couple shreds and a few scallops. Good, like Olive Garden good, but not worth $20. Calamari......obviously from a freezer box. Kick it up on the Italian food and I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pasta dish with mussels and shrimp. There were broken pieces of shell and grit in the pasta. Now, I know seafood is hard to do well, but for the price, I would have expected a little more attention to detail. Service was good, and they did validate parking so that was nice. Overall, probably wouldn't go back, and definitely would stay away from the seafood."}
{"text":"Superb! Ambiance, service and of course the food. The Homemade Lasagna was a flavorful and hearty serving. I used some bread to soak up that delicious sauce. It's more than enough to share but I ate every mouthwatering bite. My meal was finished with the warm Apple Rum Raisin Bread Pudding topped with the Vanilla Bean Gelato."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and their white wine recommendation was spot on, Riesling from WA to die for."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality pizza in Phoenix, look elsewhere. An entirely uninspiring pie. There are plenty of Italian places serving actual Neapolitan style pizza that is ten times better for the same price or cheaper. Cucina Cucina offers a pizza that is more cafeteria than DOP.    The crust is fairly thick and puffy, and lacks the distinctive taste of a well fermented dough. The menu says it was cooked in a wood-fired oven, but it was missing the leopard spotting indicative of a high-temp environment.   The sauce was also disappointing. The best sauces place fresh tomatoes at the front of the flavor profile. This sauce tasted like they couldn't be bothered to make different recipes for the pasta and the pizza. Spaghetti sauce on pizza sticks out like the sorest of thumbs.  All around low effort. The combination of arugula and prosciutto on their signature pie is one of my favorites, but even that couldn't save the experience. The margherita was worse, as the taste of the sauce was all too overpowering. Nothing stands out with these pizzas. You could get the same at any lazy chain restaurant that threw pizza on the menu as an afterthought. For an Italian place, low quality pizza is a no-go. Do yourself a favor and go to place that actually puts effort into the pizza.   Combined with somewhat lousy service, there's no reason to order this pizza a second time. Especially with so many amazing pizzerias in just about every direction.If this is modern Italian, I'd rather stick with the tradition."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Excellent salads (had salmon and beef tenderloin). Beautiful atmosphere from views to temperature to sound. Quick and very friendly service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the poorest restaurants I have been to in quite a while.  I travel a lot for work so we frequent lots of places.  Our dinner order took more than 90 minutes to arrive at the table.  I would have left much earlier but unfortunately we had the boss with us so we couldn't leave right away.    No apologies from the kitchen...really no acknowledgement that the meal took so long.  The food was decent but definitely not worth the wait.  There are too many other restaurants in close proximity that are better.  Waitress never brought the appetizer we ordered. (We subsequently cancelled the app.)  I ordered a Moretti draft from the beer menu but the waitress brought me a bottle. She told me after she brought bottle that the restaurant doesn't carry Moretti on draft anymore.  Would have been nice to know when I ordered.    Just plain old not worth it.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We went to Cucina Cucina before our concert at Talking Stick Arena and there was no wait, they were able to get us in right away. We had the fried calamari which was delicious. It just happen to be happy hour and I was able to try one of their yummy signature drinks at a discounted price. We also ordered the Cesar salad and a the Chicken Parmesan both were great. After eating they had a nice acoustic band playing and we ordered some tiramisu, which was some of the best I have ever had. I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Abel and Danny -are the best- especially Abel -  great happy hour amazing food!!! You have to try it. It's the only restaurant in the AZcenter worth going to."}
{"text":"Got the chopped salad for dinner (even though it wasn't on the dinner menu!) They were very obliged to make it for us anyways! The service was awesome - it seemed like everyone that worked their was genuinely happy and excited to be friendly and welcoming. Our server was particularly wonderful tonight, despite it being only his 5th day working there. Will definitely come back for the pasta next time"}
{"text":"Best happy hour! You can't beat $2 drafts and $4 calamari. Ask for Abel, he's the best bartender! The manager Danny also rocks."}
{"text":"So, I really hate to pull a place down, but 3 stars is all I can muster. The setting is beautiful, the staff was friendly and kind, but even after adding salt, the food was lacking flavor. The capresa salad tasted like balsamic vinaigrette. I tried to scrape it off, but it wouldn't go away. Then I ordered the seafood special. It was sold to me as a white wine based dish, but when it came to the table it was swimming in a creamy pink sauce. I would never order seafood in a red sauce, but that's how it came. The fish was bland and tasted more like tomato that what it was. It had no acid flavor to it and was completely disappointed. I ended up eating the caprese salad over the rest of my pasta dinner."}
{"text":"I just left the restaurant after 4 bites of my fettuccine di mare. When I bit into the scallop I got that unpleasant grind of sand. My wife got the lobster ravioli and she gobbled it down. So it was good. The reason for the one star isn't because of the mistakes in my order it is because when I told the waitress that I couldn't eat it because of the sand she apologized (which was nice she didn't cook it), asked if we wanted dessert, then brought us our bill. I wasn't looking for a comp but replacing my meal with a new one would have been nice. No biggie, won't be back.  Update: I have been in business and understand how a bad review can hurt a business when they make a mistake. It happens. So I am bumping the review to a two star because my wife really liked her meal and maybe the waitress didn't understand me when I said there was sand in my dish. That would explain her response. I don't think patrons should expect a comp for their meal. All I really wanted was for a new dish to be made. Bases on the first few bites before the sand I would have enjoyed the dish. If a new one was brought and it was good I would give the place 3-3.5 stars. Solid italian, in a wonderful venue."}
{"text":"The salad was perfect, but the pizza was under-cooked.  I had the Cucina Cucina pizza, this should be great as the signature dish.  A swing and a miss.  The service was fine. Our waiter spend a little too much time talking to other employees.  So they lost two stars because of things that are easily fixed... I will try them again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Pastas, salads fresh seafood! Osso Bucco Ravioli was delicious! My friend had seafood pasta and really enjoyed it too!  Prices were very reasonable and the restaurant is very close to lots of hotels in the downtown area. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So refreshing to have a nice Italian place in the Arizona center! Awesome food and a good sized menu. The staff is very friendly and the owner and manager are very polite and helpful. Can get very busy when large groups are in town, would recommend calling ahead of time for large parties, they accommodate well. This new restaurant is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant tonight and was told that they are \"out of pizza\".  Really?  How is that possible?  Did the Manager not forecast their business accordingly?  Friday night and no pizza?  In addition, it took our waitress 15 minutes to bring us our drinks, had to ask for a refill and ask for our bill.  Although she was friendly, she was not an efficient waitress.  Very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"This post is overdue.  We ate there about two weeks ago because we were giving a relative a ride downtown.  Feeling like a nice Italian meal, we selected Cucina Cucina.  The caprese salad appetizer was very nice.  The tomatoes were actually red!  I had a chicken entr√©e that was very nice. My companion had pasta with sausage, which was very tasty. Surprisingly, the side on my meal was outstanding -- mixed veggies with a delicious garlic and olive oil glaze.  Service was attentive without hovering.  Best of all, Cucina Cucina is locally-owned.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a member of a large dinner club that tries different restaurants across valley.  I have to say, Cucina Cucina was a pleasant surprise and I would highly recommend them.  The waiter was attentive but not over bearing.  He allowed us to enjoy the meal but never ran out of drinks or other desires.  We had the shrimp appetizer and it was incredible.  I had the Rigatoni, my wife had the Lobster Ravioli. The sauce on both dishes was perfect.  Often times the sauce is too rich and cakey but this was not the case. Both dishes came out hot and appeared pleasing to the eye.  I am a big eater and the serving size did not disappoint.  I looked around the table and could see large helpings of each meal.  There were 23 of us in all and not one complaint.  If I want to be critical, the flour less chocolate cake was too rich for me, chocolate lovers at the table gladly helped it get consumed.  They waiter handled the request for individual checks without complaint.  We noticed the gratuity was added to each check.  18% seemed less than fair for his service.  I think, had he told us the tip was included, he may have received more.  I was very surprised at the small amount of patrons, Phoenix has an under utilized gem in this restaurant. Overall, I would highly recommend Cucina Cucina.  Lastly, I wish the manager would have come by and introduced themselves so they could hear first hand our positive review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking around central and decided to try something new. Well that never happened, they greeted us then sat us to our table and we sat there for half an hour with no service and they severed people who showed up after us. And we walked out and the waiters weren't doing anything and the hostess' were standing dealing with a customer who was complaining and said \"goodnight\" with an attitude as if we did something to them."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, however, the service was horrible. It took 30 minutes for them to even greet us and take our drink orders then 30 minutes for our food to come then my food order was completely wrong, and they didn't even say sorry or offer a discount. The food was good though."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly and polite service! The view was amazing too of the outside fountain and the place was so clean and the quality of everything was perfect! The portions for the bread and butter were a little small but they gave us more without us even asking."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place as my hubby's favorite food is pasta and it's super convenient for us in the neighborhood. We picked this place cause we were going to watch a movie after at the AMC. There is 2 hour validation for the restaurant so you can park in the parking structure. We didn't ask and we weren't told. No biggie.  Server was great. We got there at 4pm on a Friday and I guess there wasn't a big happy hour crowd as there was only 1 other table occupied.   Ordered caprese salad $10. Was fine but nothing elegant or extra special. Hubby had lasagna $16 which has pork and beef. Was decent but he said the pasta was a little overcooked.  I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. $15. At first glance, it had not enough sauce for me. About 5 meatballs. They were delicious. I cut them up and had a piece with every bite if the noodles and it was yummy. The pasta was overcooked a little but that's the way I like it. Most dont.  Bread is just bread. Tiny bit of butter they give you. It got better when I asked for oil and vinegar which he gladly brought out. We were in and out in 40 minutes. The crowd started to show up as there was a special group event in the front area.  Beautiful patio dining but we sat inside.   We will try again, maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, but sadly the horrible service was difficult to deal with. We were in a large group with 6-10 people per table, each table with their own waiter and assistant. However, we had to ask for water 3 times, it took about 30 min just to get water. Some people had to share water glasses. We got plenty of bread with spicy olive oil dipping sauce, which they served before anyone had water. The issue was that the wait staff had no direction, were running around doing a whole lot of nothing. Food was dropped, food was delivered after sitting on a tray next to us for at least 5 min. In order to improve, they need to train their staff how to handle large groups, how to delivery water and food at the right times (This is restaurant 101, simple fixes and easy to improve upon). The location is beautiful and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The Lasagna was perfect. The best I've ever had.  The appetizer mozzarella bread was fresh and amazing. Love this place. Service was awesome.  Def will be back. Love it. !"}
{"text":"We have dined at Cucina Cucina in the past , outside on the patio and loved it. The Arizona Center is undergoing renovations. Not much ambiance. Food is still good."}
{"text":"Do not come here for the pizza. Cibo, Pomo, Forno just to name a few within walking distance that are so much better. This is school cafeteria pizza. Will come back and try the pasta next time. Drinks weren't very good either. Sitting outside on the patio in the spring is great though."}
{"text":"The sister was craving Italian food and she stumbled across this place on Yelp. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived around 5:30 PM, but more people started trickling in around 6-7 PM. I would recommend making a quick reservation on Yelp if you can!   For an appetizer, we ordered the mozzarella sticks (forgot the actual name as they weren't actually sticks, but more like mozzarella toasts). This dish was okay, but not fantastic. For entrees, we ordered the fettuccine di mare and the pepperoni pizza with added arugula. I can agree with some Yelpers that the fettuccine di mare was dry. Even with the sauce on the bottom, the dish seemed dry and thick to me. They are decently generous with the mussels, shrimp, and scallops in this dish though. The pepperoni pizza dish was very basic and nothing stood out about it. I think overall, the food here was definitely underwhelming.  Our waitress was super nice however! She seemed to be running all over the place especially when a large party was seated, but the service is definitely there."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating is pleasant with a nice surrounding view. Chopped salad was good along with grilled calamari. The pizza wasn't as good as I expected. Toppings we minimal and the crust wasn't that great. My teenager really liked his pizza though. Great service. Gma liked her salmon salad"}
{"text":"Since we are downtown residents, we had to try out the new kid on the block.  We snagged a great seat on the patio last weekend and enjoyed a nice meal - the seafood risotto for my husband and the rigatoni for me.  The portions were huge and the quality of the food was great too!  Definitely a nice addition to the downtown dining scene!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have came here twice. The service is always very good and food comes pretty quick. The food is very good, probably the best Italian in Phoenix. Nice environment and good outdoor atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful setting in the Arizona Center! A wonderful patio overlooking beautiful , palm trees that light up when the sunsets. Cucina Cucina definitely has the stake on location! My husband and I decided to try Cucina Cucina this week before heading to a Jazz concert in the area. He's just had surgery so he wasn't really wanting anything like a huge meal and I wanted something Italian and light, as well! We arrived about 1730 on this perfect spring evening with a slight breeze and a nice 76* temp outside.. Arizona perfection! We were set at a beautiful table on the patio. There was a fire pit next to our table, which has to be awesome when its lit up too. Our server was at our table within a few minutes and I wanted to know about happy hour. She seemed a bit clueless to that and had to go ask someone. When she returned she told us about the happy hour specials a few appetizers, beer and cocktails. Sadly, she said there are no wines on the happy hour menu. I found a few things amiss with this: a server should always sit you and start with what the specials, (if any are available that night), and what is going on with happy hour. She spent a good 4-5 minutes figuring that out. When we ordered, happy hour was going to be over. Oh well. She was sweet enough and I didn't feel like pushing the issue on such a nice night out.  Next, an Italian restaurant leaving wine off of happy hour? I wonder what that is about? And why is there no printed happy hour menu, anyway for the table...I for one am more of a visual person and when someone is rattling off a menu, with , \"Ummm we have bruschetta, and yeah, ummm calamari for ummm I think ...\" , I get lost! I know Cucina Cucina has just opened and being a foodie tends to make you 'compare notes' to other places. I just found myself immediately wishing we had opted for our favorite Italian place down the way .. other than for the view and the great patio, which I loved about this choice! With that,  I ordered a Prosecco and we decided to order three appetizers to share. The Brodetta di Mare Black Mussels, which were bathed in a delicious garlic Brodetta chardonnay sauce with chunks of tomatoes. This comes with a couple slices of wonderful bread to soak the sauce up with. They were very good! The Gamberetti, a little pricey for the amount of shrimp you get. They are saut√©ed shrimp and the sauce seemed the same as the Brodetta di Mare, despite that it not described that way on the menu. We loved this appetizer. It was also served with two slices of toasted bread. We also ordered the Antipasto Misto, a charcuterie plate of salami, proscuitto, two Italian cheeses, (we had a fresh mozzarella and parmesan), roasted Italian vegetables, and walnuts. The kalamata olives were pitted and that was a nice touch that many places don't offer. There was no bread offered with this appetizer. We have had charcuterie plates a lot of places and this was the first time we had seen no bread. The parma cheese was sliced so thin though, it was almost shaved and in Arizona, it dries pretty fast! Again, I have not seen that before on charcuterie/frommagio plates. Mind you, its $16 and there could have been a little bread , or flat bread wafers AND not shaved cheese.. BUT,  we liked it a lot. WE did ask our waitress for bread and she brought us some house bread, but this appetizer does not apparently come with bread. I am reading this review and thinking .. 'hmm, i worked out hard today... I must have needed BREAD!!!'.. haha.. The dinner menu here looks amazing, as does the dessert menu, which we were not offered. Our plates were cleared and our waitress arrived with our bill, we needed to go off to our concert, but that was a bit odd to not be offered coffee or dessert and just given the check! In her defense, she told us she was new and I remember the days of being a college student and young and waitressing.. No thank you! I do want to come back to Cucina Cucina and try a good dinner entree and more wine! This patio is amazing and in June they are to start having live music and this will be the perfect place for it! I have no doubt that Cucina Cucina is working out minor kinks in the new opening.. greatness awaits!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday with a couple of friends. We each ordered something very different. Started of with fried calamari and a deep fried ciabatta bread stuffed with fresh mozzarella. So delicious and looked like a fancy grilled cheese but one of the best grilled cheese I've ever had. One friend ordered chicken marsala with mascarpone mashed potatoes. Very, very good! My other friend had spaghetti and meatballs. Also very good and the meatballs were yummy. I had the beef tenderloin with a mushroom risotto. So yummy! Beef was cooked perfect and so tender. Delicious food all around. Happy hour prices on select appetizers and drinks were great."}
{"text":"The wait staff and atmosphere was excellent! The food I ordered, however, was not.    I wasn't hungry enough for a plate of pasta, so I order the Caprese Salad and the Calamari. The food came out hot and in a timely manner. The Caprese was the better of the two dishes, though, the tomatoes were a pithy and the mozzarella was a bit rubbery and dry. The basil was perfect and fresh.   As for the Calamari? I think I would still be chewing on it if I hadn't decided to spit it into my napkin. I thought it might have been a bad piece, so I tried a few more with no luck. It was the chewiest, toughest Calamari I've ever had. I think pencil erasers have more give.  Everyone else at my table made positive comments about their food. The scampi pasta dishes looked delicious.   After this experience, my suggestion would be to stay away from the appetizers and stick with the entrees."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch this past weekend. We were able to get right in and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. Our server was friendly and the food was good, we both had paninis from the lunch menu. We'll definitely be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Nestled within the gorgeous garden landscape of the Arizona Center is this promising restaurant called Cucina Cucina Modern Italian.  It was a fantastically marvelous day, worthy of celebration. My beloved wife had just completed another semester with Straight A's, and she deserved a celebratory outing with yours truly.  We originally had opted to catch an earlier showing at the AMC Theater so that we could catch dinner afterwards. However, after stopping by this restaurant and perusing the menu, we chose to attend a later showing, and partake of this restaurant's offerings.  We were promptly seated by the hostess, and our drink orders were quickly obtained. However, that was the last vestige of efficiency we experienced, as things went quickly south after that.  After the many apologies from the various servers we kept getting handed off to, we got the point. It was prom weekend, and there was a convention downtown, and they were swamped.   However, having sat there for over an hour before we actually were served our main entrees was quite unpardonable. During the server shifts, we actually lost track of who was supposed to ensure that we got our orders in promptly. That, plus the fact that our drink orders were incorrect from the onset, did not bode well for our first experience here.  There are only two reasons why I am giving them 3 stars:  1) The view and the atmosphere from the patio was simply gorgeous. It just made for a great and comfortable time to spend catching up with my wife after a hectic semester.  2) The food was actually quite delicious. My wife's homemade Lasagna was above average in both flavor and texture. The Sauce was quite rich and delectable. My Linguini Vongole had the benefit of these spectacularly fresh clams. For being in Arizona, that is a quite wonderfully complimentary.  However, the service confusion, myriad of delays, and nearly missing our show really just severely detracted from our overall experience. This should've been a great hit of a restaurant as far as we were concerned.  Nonetheless, the overall chaotic interaction, and seemingly lack of coordination made for an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"This was the first time here and we were greeted with a warm smile by the hostess/manager.  She sat us down to what looked like a really nice Italian restaurant...atmosphere and ambience was upscale and inviting.  Unfortunately, our experience soon changed, but not in a good way.  The waiter was cordial, but after taking our drink orders, he disappeared for awhile.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all for being a Saturday night.  We finally got our drinks, but no bread basket...a little peculiar for such a nice place.  We ended up ordering 4 dishes and after a 20 minute wait, our food came out with the bread basket...an afterthought at this point.  We asked twice for refills, but it wasn't until finally the manager heard us, she took it upon herself to bring a carafe.    The food came out at room temperature. The Fettuccine Di Mare had definitely been sitting for awhile.   kids cheese pizza $6 even the kids wouldn't eat it because the Crust was slightly undercooked...a bit soggy even.  Lobster ravioli $23 Was ok, nothing special really, but the best out of all the dishes that we ordered.  Bucca Di Peppo makes it much better.  Risotto de Manzo $22 The steak was a very petite steak and it was very undercooked for medium rare.  I'm sure the bed of mushroom, that the steak sat on, came from a box of Rice-a-Roni.  I think Cambell's cream of mushroom had more and bigger mushrooms than what I saw for this dish.  Fettuccine Di Mara $19 Dry...horribly, dry.  Im not exaggerating when I say, there was no sauce.  It was even slightly on the cold side.  Underneath the pile of pasta, I counted 3 shrimp, 3 muscles, and 2 scallops.  I was really disappointed with this one...it sounded so good on the menu.  Because we had a Groupon for $80, we had a little left over to get dessert.  Dessert portions were sharing size.  Chocolate torte $8 We asked for the sauce on the side but clearly they didn't understand and instead brought extra sauce on the side  Bread pudding $8 More bread then pudding gelato on top helped. At least they didn't mess up the strawberries.  Was this Groupon worth it?  No, would not come back again."}
{"text":"It was ok. I might come back. I got the clam fettuccine and the noodles were kinda weirdly cooked and short. My boyfriend got the prosciutto  and arugula pizza. He mentioned it was alright but he had explosive diarrhea after."}
{"text":"As several other reviews have mentioned, this used to be My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. My wife and I used to go there occasionally, mainly to enjoy some wine on the huge patio in the cooler months. When it changed to Cucina Cucina, we didn't go for a number of months after they opened. That's partially because we're low-carb eaters and that can be tough in an Italian place, but it was also quite frankly simple inertia. Mistake!  We've come to love this place over the last six months or so. We've done everything from happy hour snacks to lunch salads to family dinners here, and we've always had excellent experiences. Receiving the Mike-n-Carrie seal of approval...  Apps: Gamberetti (shrimp) Bruschetta Calamari  Pizza (yeah yeah, I fell off the low-carb wagon briefly, sue me): Pepperoni  Salsiccia (sausage and peppers)  Salads: Caprese Salmon (holy hell, delicious) Shrimp Chicken (great low-carb option and very filling)  Pastas: Fettuccini con Pollo Spaghetti and meatballs (more on the meatballs later) Spinach ravioli (wife loves this one)  I also had an Osso Bucco special one night that was excellent.  They make all the pastas in-house, which sets up the flavors for the whole dish, and they're great. If you're into that kind of high-carb thing, that is. They'll happily accommodate low-carb eaters, though. We stopped in last Sunday and Carrie was hungry. Owner Danny (a very cool guy, incidentally) hooked her up with a plate of meatballs with marinara and cheese and a side salad, hold the croutons. The meatballs, by the way, are outstanding and a meal by themselves! They were admittedly out of her favored bleu cheese dressing that day, but I'm not knocking off a star for that.  Happy hour pricing is awesome, on both drinks and select apps, and I have a VERY difficult time resisting the happy hour personal pizzas for $5. Anyway, we pop in for a couple of glasses of red wine and maybe a snack from time to time and always enjoy it.  The only thing to really watch out for is the fake bartender, Edgar. Behind his facade of charm, outgoing friendliness and self-confidence lies a guy who had to be taught how to make a PROPER Old Fashioned. What kind of bartender MUDDLES FRUIT in an Old Fashioned? Shameful, I know, but he's now been corrected. On the other hand, the man does pour a fine mimosa: OJ applied with an eye dropper. I suppose it evens out.  My only regret about Cucina Cucina is that they make it so damn easy to fall off the low-carb wagon, but the fault for that lies in my lack of self-discipline rather that with the good folks at Cucina! Check the place out. There's seldom a wait, the patio is gorgeous, the food we've tried has been great, and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I used to frequent a restaurant by the same name in Seattle which was quite good until it tried to go 'modern' and finally shut down. So I was pleasantly surprised to find one in the Arizona center mall, of all places.  Service was outstanding and very welcoming. I wanted to do a movie and dinner. Cucina Cucina is one of the few places that was open after 9pm. Most crowds were gone and so were guests in this restaurants. The server was very good and the manager dropped by to make menu suggestions. They make their pasta fresh - I wish I could have tried that but went for the risotto instead. They made it vegetarian and there were other decent choices for vegetarians as well.   Food was very tasty - much better than the original restaurant I used to go to. Presentation was very good and service was very friendly. Service was quick.  The place is not very well known - and this restaurant is a new hidden gem in a mall that was very empty on a hot sunny June evening. I am not a local, but will go there any time I visit for business."}
{"text":"Excellent environment, excellent food, excellent price! Definite winner. Spaghetti & Meatball (sub sausage) Arugula Salad (no cheese) Blue Moon"}
{"text":"The overall experience was \"okay\" but less than what we expected.  Service was fair, I am not sure if the server was new, but most of the questions we asked she said she wasn't sure and would need to check.  The food was also \"okay\" some of the chicken tasted over cooked and dry.  The marinara sauce wasn't all that tasteful.  Lastly, because we were a party of 6, they automatically add the gratuity.  The menu on the website says they will add 18%, but they added 20%, not that big of a deal but I feel when a place does that, I think it's common courtesy to let the customer know that either verbally or write it on the bill.  I know it does have a line item showing the gratuity, but I am sure it's missed quite often if not pointed out."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good food but their service FUCKIN SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS! As soon as we walked in the manager who from this point on, I will refer to as \"gray jacket\", he and the  hostess just stared at us. I was confused. It was so awkward and weird that I almost thought I worked there and I forgot to greet them. This was just the beginning. It took a legit 10 min before anyone came over to our table. Finally a sweet girl came over and it wasn't even her table. She provided us with water and right after our actual waiter came over. Oh and the water had lemon in it and the rind on both lemons had the blackest dirt on them. Safe to say I wasn't going to drink it. The complimentary bread was cool, the bruschetta we ordered was pretty delicious, Sicilian pizza was good and her lobster ravioli was pretty good as well. Although you could tell the ravioli was sitting for a little while because it was warm and not hot. My pizza was burnt on one end so they ever so cleverly cut the edge of the crust off on one side. Probably the funniest thingI have ever seen when it comes to food I've ordered at a restaurant. I guess they said fuck it, this guy doesn't need crust on this end anyway. Our waiter rarely came to our table. I think I can count on two fingers the amount of times he came. Oh that would be two. Then gray jacket is probably the worst restaurant manager ever. This guy went two places in the restaurant. He stayed at the hostess stand and laughed it up at the bar with his servers all night. The place was less than half full and no one was being waited on. A group of ladies had to take their checks up to the front to pay because no one was walking around. I think gray jacket was planning out his next venture because he seemed to be day dreaming, gazing out of the window into the abyss. He never checked on anyone or made sure his wait staff were doing a good job. I just left cash in the checkbook and left because we were waiting forever for someone to first bring the check and then to pick it up. I thought no way the service can be as bad as yelpers have stated in previous reviews. I was wrong. New management is needed."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying the place was pretty empty when I arrived and stayed that way during the duration of my meal. After being greeted by my waiter, who was actually training someone else, with the greeting of \"Hey bud, how's it hanging?\" The overall tone of my experience was set. The \"trainer\" NEVER came out to see how much I was/was not enjoying my meal, and only AFTER waiving my glass in the air did I get a refill of my drink....Oh and neither the trainer or the trainee delivered my meal.  Come on folks...Have we really sunk so low that we greet our customers by calling them slang pronouns?  The food was good but the ambiance set by the stellar trainer, ain't going to be bringing this bud back ever again.   Good luck with the training."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, the wait staff friendly and attentive, the food (I ordered the Fettucini di Mare) was excellent.   So everything was fantastic except for one thing.  We had a party of five. We did not make a reservation for 6, six was never mentioned.  Despite this, and the clear \"parties of six or more\" writing on the bottom of all menus, auto-grat was still added and there was NO indication given besides on the final receipt, not the signing copy.  It was a bush-league move from a restaurant trying to present itself as a classy, modern-Italian restaurant.   The food is good enough to almost make me reconsider coming back with another group of 5, which I believe is still less than 6."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants we've been too. Excellent food and service. Highly recommend if you're in the downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Cucina Cucina is super close to my office so a coworker and I stopped by for lunch. It definitely outranks all the other restaurants in the area (with the exception of the District). It's great to have something of higher caliber in walking distance. Solid 4 stars across the board.   Since the weather is so nice this time of year, we sat outside on the patio. I absolutely love the atmosphere out there - shady because it's in the shadows of the nearby sky scrapers, with the noise of the plaza's fountains keeping everything peaceful. The meal started with complimentary garlic bread and butter. Our waitress was timely which is always appreciated when out to lunch during work.   I ordered the lasagna and my coworker got the shrimp appetizer as a meal. The lasagna portion was huge, tasted fresh and filled me up. Some bites tasted slightly sweet which I didn't like, but overall it was very good. The shrimp appetizer my coworker ordered came with four jumbo shrimp, saut√©ed in white wine, garlic, lemon juice and tomatoes. He didn't share with me but said they were great. Being an appetizer, the portion was a little small to eat as an entree but he said it was enough food since he wasn't very hungry to begin with. We tried the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert - my favorite dessert in the world. It was good, but not great. The custard was a little too warm and tasted orange-y. I probably wouldn't order it again.   4 stars for lasagna and shrimp appetizer, 5 stars for free bread (who can say no to free food!?), 3 stars for creme br√ªl√©e. Everything on the menu looks fantastic so I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The problem with the blanket star rating on Yelp is that sometimes the service is really bad, and other times it's just the food, but in this case I can safely say my star rating covers both at Cucina Cucina. We went on a Saturday night, which is not a busy time for Arizona Center. Our server was very inattentive, never asking if my husband wanted another beer and never refilling my water. He also did my least favorite thing, which was to bring our entr√©es before he had cleared our appetizer plates. We had to help him bus the table so he could put our plates down. As an Italian myself, I know that my expectations for an Italian restaurant are high. Still, anyone should be able to expect certain standards in relation to the food that is served to them, especially at the prices Cucina Cucina is charging.  We started with the antipasto tray, which was very disappointing considering the price. The meat was cut in a haphazard way and there were only two Italian cheeses of the varieties served. The plate also came with four water crackers. Whaaat?? While bread was provided free of charge, we had to ask for it. My husband ordered the Risotto de Manzo (beef tenderloin). Although the rice was cooked well, the meat was overdone - it was all gray, not a speck of pink, a complete insult to that cut of meat. I had the Fettuccini di Mare. I'll have to admit that the pasta itself was pretty good, but the three muscles on the dish were gritty. The attention to detail just wasn't there, and for the price, this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant in downtown Phoenix. We stopped here before a concert and love it! The food was fresh and delicious. Considering the location, the prices and portions were great! We will definitely come again when we are downtown for an event!  We sat on the patio by the fire pit. We had salad, Rigatoni Al Forno and one of the best Creme Br√ªl√©e's ever!  As an added bonus, they take reservations via Yelp!"}
{"text":"I had the Risotto de Manzo was absolutely wonderful.   I think I could eat it every day and not get tired of it!   Tried the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. Two thumbs up there too.  Tasted the tiramisu- it was a bit dry.    The service sets them apart from other restaurants in my opinion.  I sat in the bar area and the waiters were engaging and helpful but not intrusive.   The restaurant recently opened and they were \"out\" of a few menu items.  They will need to get that fixed but what they did have was delicious."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and Abel took excellent care of us. I had the Cesar salad and seafood special and it was amazing. The ambiance was perfectly suited for a single person on a work trip looking for a good meal. Abel took great care of me and had great recommendations. Would definitely come back if I was a local."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food! Danny, our host was the bomb! Highly recommend the Italian sausage pizza!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant will charge you tips even though you are only two people there. And the waiter will not notify you this. We asked his manager. The manager even told us that we were foreigners. He felt no guilty. I hope everyone can saw this. I am not satisfied with this restaurant. The food here is also not as good as its decoration."}
{"text":"The only thing saving this review from getting one star was the sweet server, and how she handled our clearly not-so-good experience.   The place was deserted at 6pm on a weekday night. Our server (Emily) greeted us with a smile and was very attentive throughout the entire meal. I ordered what the menu described as \"Lobster Ravioli with cream sauce and SCALLOPS. Hence the plural description for scallops. Wife ordered the Cucina Pizza.  The Ravioli was cold, so I immediately notified the waitress, and she took the plate back to the kitchen. It came back to our table about 3 minutes later steaming hot, but... with a ravioli half eaten... the same ravioli I took a bite out of prior to sending it back. Obviously they microwaved it or threw it back in a pan, when any reasonable chef would have remade the dish in an expedited manner. Now my ravioli was borderline hard. The lobster filling was dry, tasteless and had the consistency of sawdust. But that's not where the buck stopped. Despite the menu saying the dish came with pan seared scallops. it actually only comes with ONE single quarter sized scallop. You read that correctly. Only one. Said scallop was the size of a quarter and only about 3/4 inch thick and terribly over cooked. UPDATE::: Looking through the photos past reviewers have left here, it appears this dish was served with many more scallops only 1 month ago. What gives?:::  My wife's Cucina Cucina pizza should have been called the arugula pizza, because thats all that could be seen on it. Arulula piled high. The pizza wasnt bad once half the arugula was removed, but it looked nothing like the same Cucina Cucina pizza that past reviewers have snapped photos of.   Rebecca the General Manger... She's every resteraunt owner's dream GM. Our server had Rebecca come to our table when things started to awry. Rebecca, if you're reading this, please understand that you were the saving grace of our experience. I hope your boss reads this and gives you a big whopping raise and most importantly... the proper tools for you to succeed. Quite candidly, I think you're too good for this place. Rebecca told us that the ravioli dish always comes with only one scallop. She admitted to us that the menu was false, but that she \"didn't have the power to change the menu, but had the power to take $10 off of the bill.\" I would have rather not paid a dime for my dish, but alas, the free cheesecake was a nice gesture.   In closing, we will probably not be returning to Cucina Cucina Modern Italian. The food and menu consistency needs to be changed drastically. Do that, and manage to keep Rebecca and Emily, and this place will be a hit."}
{"text":"This was the second time my friends and I tried this place and so glad we gave it another shot! The first visit we left unhappy, but this time everything was on point and amazing! Our server Jeremy was super attentive and had great suggestions for us. We ordered caprese and calamari for apps which were both super delicious and a great size. Then we tried 3 different entrees, two risottos and spinach ravioli which we all shared and loved. Overall great atmosphere, superb fast service and delicious food. We will be back again soon for another ladies night."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I'm staying downtown for a weekend event and the hotel is within walking distance of this restaurant and the others in this center. I was fortunate to go on a quiet evening so I was able to get some intel from the bartender Nicole.  Quite a big place, about 160 inside and another 140 outside. They have a dozen seats at the bar but a few tables for 6 in the bar area. I would imagine it gets crowded on the weekend. They do have 2 TVs in the bar area so if you want to watch a game, you'll have to sit there.  The outdoor area is very nice, over looking white Christmas light wrapped trees. I can see it being very popular on nice evenings. I had the cheese stuffed ravioli with spinach, but instead of the normal marinara, I requested a white cream sauce. It was an excellent choice. They top the dish with a cool ricotta cheese, which I used like button on bread as I enjoyed individual bites of the ravioli. They were quite big, cut them into several pieces and relaxed and enjoyed my meal. Also had a glass of their house Pinot Noir, which I preferred to their Angeline Pinot.  Only slight negative, overall price for one entree and one glass of wine, $24 before tip. Even though it was very good, the wine was good and the service was excellent, I think $20 would have made the experience better for me but, they have to pay rent and I'm sure they based it on the neighborhood and other restaurants in the area. If you're in the mood for Italian and in the area, give it a try and...Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  I was surprised that an Italian restaurant did not offer bread with our spinach salad or while waiting for our meals.  I got the pollo Parmesan and my hubs got the risotto with beef.  Both meals were ok but over salted.  We were not overly impressed with our meals so we passed on desert."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, we were seated and served promptly. A short wine list but not a bad selection. Started with calamari, had better but this was fine. Ordered the veal parmigiana, now I'm Italian and I judge all Italian restaurants by their veal parmigiana so please don't take this the wrong way. The veal was very tender and had a perfect crust, the marinara sauce was very tasty and perfect for the veal. Generally I prefer sliced mozzarella on my veal as this brings out the flavor of a good cheese. This was shredded cheese and lacked that good home style flavor it may have very well been pre packaged cheese. The pasta was very tasty but cooked through, not over cooked just cooked through. A home style Italian restaurant will serve it's pasta al dente. Now this is Phoenix not New York so I still was very satisfied and would go back. But I have had better. Cost is a bit higher then most but this is a high rent area. All in all don't expect mamas cooking but you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"What a farce. They are NOT OPEN. was looking for decent Italian food but ended up with bastardized pasta from Canyon Cafe. Nice people. Slow service but at least they are honest about their business hours. We are tourists and relying on yelp to help us find a Good place to eat. Oh well."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble on this restaurant on a Saturday night after a long work day.  Thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance and friendliness of bartender Abel and staff.  Relaxing and delicious dinner.  I would recommend this place definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The food was good; nothing special! There are far better Italian restaurants in and around Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok fellow foodies...  Only open 3 weeks this place is a welcome outdoor venue in downtown Phoenix. The atmosphere is alive on the patio. There is several conventions in town. Nice to see every place busy. The fountains and the lit trees almond with perfect 75 degree weather set the stage. Manny our server was great. He knew every item on the menu and how it was prepared. This is not a must stop destination, but the food was nicely prepared. I tried the Gambetti (shrimp) from the lunch menu (4 stars). The bruschetta was very tasty (3.5). From the dinner menu we had fettuccine and chicken, just what wanted. Also the grilled lamb chops tilted the scale at 4.5 stars. I'll be back when we see an early movie.  Once the pizza oven works I look forward to trying a slice!  Overall they delivered a nice experience.  I guess the best was the deserts...  We had three, our Server Manny picked for us. The surprise was bread pudding, chocolate tort and tiramisu.  Juan the owner stopped by to check on us and it turns out he owns another favorite in north Scottsdale, The Hacienda."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go when visiting AZ! The workers are so friendly and very helpful! The food is always very tasty and at a very reasonable price! (I guess I'm so used to over priced Californian food). I've never had a bad dish here and the portions are definitely worth your money!"}
{"text":"We 12 loved our server, Kay! She alone deserves five stars PLUS! And then the gluten free pizza...YOW! Delicious-- I kept wondering if it was actually GF, but they reassured me and I didn't get sick, so...it wa style best GF pizza EVER. I ordered the Cucina Cucina pizza with the arugula salad on top. Delish! Seafood fettuccini was \"fantastic\" said my partner. This restaurant and Province are the best reasons we found to head downtown."}
{"text":"The food was amazing Happy hour prices great And bartender Abel was quick and made great recommendations for the food and wine Going back for sure"}
{"text":"Really Delicious Lunch here at Cucina. My husband had the Pollo Parmigiana  , he loved it. I had Demanso  Arugula salad. I will come back just for that salad- every bite was so good.The staff was super friendly and my Ice Tea never seen half a glass."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!!'  Abel is the BEST bartender alive.  The food is delicious.  The best ever.  But the bartender Abel is the best I have ever been around.  He truly cares for his customers.  Service is wonderful."}
{"text":"The owner Chris chased ,threw rocks at, and physically assaulted an officer of the superior court on November 1 2017 and was not arrested. This is not a very well family oriented business. I would stay far away from these crazy people and their restaurants."}
{"text":"If you like Italian, my advice is you skip this place. Not good at all. We were very disappointed. The red sauce should be in a Mexican restaurant instead of Italian place."}
{"text":"Simply excellent. We'll be back. Mashed potatoes that came with osso buco were best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"My mother and I ventured to Phoenix to use a Groupon for this restaurant. First of all the atmosphere is absolutely wonderful the food was amazing and the best part was our server Manny. he took excellent care of us. My mother and I loved it so much that we are planning to have a get-together with friends there for happy hour. This is definitely a must try"}
{"text":"Four stars for the ambiance, space, and  service.  Three stars for the food (that's not bad, especially considering they had gluten free pasta).  Decent sauces."}
{"text":"Last year during Phoenix Comicon, we visited this location and found a Greek place with okay food and horrible service. This year, we found Cucina Cucina and experienced pure bliss.  It was fairly empty in there, which was a surprise, but other people's loss was our gain. Our server was funny and attentive. It took no time to get our food, and it was AMAZING. I was there with a friend, and we had brainshare as we ordered the same thing and split the appetizer, the focaccia.   My word. See, I'm a home baker and a total bread snob, this focaccia was perfection. Hot, chewy, cheesy, perfectly seasoned with fresh rosemary. The oil for dipping was great, and we encouraged our server to pile on the freshly-grated Parmesan.  We both had the fragola insalate salad, which in English would best be described as strawberry and goat cheese salad. The menu didn't mention adding meat to salads, but I queried, and the server said we could get whatever we wanted added on. We both opted for grilled chicken. Oh man, it was fantastic. Everything was fresh. My only criticism is that I would have liked more goat cheese since I just had a few lumps.   I would happily, enthusiastically eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch on the weekend.  Very nice atmosphere and wasn't crowded at all. Service was also good.  Food was lacking a little.  Ordered the chicken parmigiana panini with a side Caesar salad.  The chicken was breaded but didn't have much flavor.  Seemed like the sandwich sat out a little long as it wasn't hot when served.  The salad had too much dressing and was soggy."}
{"text":"I noticed them move in to the AZ Center a while ago and wanted to give them a go. I was pleasantly surprised. The Bruschetta was good. I had their Pollo Scaloppini and it was amazing. My girlfriend had the Risotto De Zucca, and it was also amazing. Service was good and we sat out side on and cool spring evening. Clean, contemporary ambiance. Fits very well where located. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this restaurant. Some colleagues and I stopped by for lunch and we had George as our server. George was extremely helpful and was amazing server throughout the lunch. One of my colleagues and I ordered the Fettuccine con pollo. This was hands down delicious. The fresh pasta was such a nice touch and the Alfredo sauce was just the right amount.  My other colleague ordered the pesto pizza and it super tasty! I brought some left overs for my husband to try and he ate it all!! I will definitely be coming back here more often than I am supposed to, but I love love love the fresh pasta. Welcome to the Arizona Center - Cucina Cucina. You have been a great addition."}
{"text":"Food was a 4 service was a 2. Host and waiter need training. Food auctioned off, table not cleared between courses....lackluster service made the nice meal a poor experience. Then we get auto gratuity added because we are a party of 6. He removed the auto tip after I questioned it but let me know that it's a rule printed on the menu. Thank you but a 20% tip is for good service and this was far from good."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we are in town. Staff is always friendly, food is priced very reasonably and always delicious !!! Started out with their bruschetta, the hint of balsamic reduction sauce makes this outstanding.  Main course was Risotto Frutti Di Mare and my wife had Vitelli Scaloppini both were very good. Portions are plentiful."}
{"text":"Food very good, service atrocious, finished meal.amd still have salad plates on the table. Server spent majority of our time here chatting with the next table   Only 3 tables in the whole restaurant"}
{"text":"Great food.. perfect amount of seafood and I went away very happy. Great atmosphere on the patio with wonderful lights and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I have becoming to Cucina for months. The food was good but the service was better!  Now with the changes they have made, the food rivals the service!  Please give it a try!"}
