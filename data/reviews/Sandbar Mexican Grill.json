{"text":"This has been the worst experience I have ever received at a business establishment. So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member..   This is how the story goes:  My girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd.   At this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow.   So we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow.   So then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.  It's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone.   So officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins..... *This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*  NOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!"}
{"text":"So you don't want to go to Old Town on a Friday night? Then Sandbar is for you. Dip you toes in the sand and dance the night away to the beats of that song you don't remember the words to, but feel compelled to attempt to sing. I don't think there is a better atmosphere in North Phoenix on a Friday or Saturday night, but if you cannot take part in the late night fun stop in for their extended happy hour from 3-7 every day and get some chips and homemade guacamole and a chamboard margarita to convince you to stay after sundown."}
{"text":"Ok so let's be honest, if your looking for a fancy 5 star steakhouse where the waiters wear floor length aprons, this isn't the place. But if you want Good food and amazing service. This is the place. The drinks are great, we love the staff. Music is always enjoyable to hear. They have great DJ's. It's a nice laid back environment. Taco Tuesday.......see for your self."}
{"text":"We've been here twice since moving to the area. It's just ok. The outside porch area is where all the fun is at. They had a live cover band going on Friday night that was great. Covered all the 80s hair band songs. The beer was not cold. It was disappointing. The food was just ok. Go here for atmosphere, not the menu"}
{"text":"Well in town for the races so we like to support the local businesses well we were recommended to this place and if I could punch out my team mate I would service was horrible took 2 hours to get order and food....appetizers came out with main course so the cheese was glazed over on my nachos....never again"}
{"text":"I stopped by when they were having the wintertime snow day. The guy who was selling the food outside was touching the money and the food all at the same time. This employee I'm sure works as a cook inside so I'm thinking, do they even wash their hands before cooking. He was handling the cheese, tortillas and the money at the same time. I would never eat here again. GROSS food. This place is a sad excuse for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I like Sandbar! :) The drinks are good, and I always have a great time with friends. They do need to change up their music...too old school!"}
{"text":"Despite the lack of service, I would definitely go again which I think is a rare thing to say on a first visit. The only thing that saved the poor waitress was that it was her first day and it was very busy nonetheless. However, if it's your first day, why are you not writing down orders? We had to wait 30 minutes for drinks, I was completely ignored at first. Then, we received the wrong appetizers and meals, as well as not being checked on more frequently. I understand that it was her first shift so I'm not upset with her but more so with her training or lack thereof. She stayed super upbeat and positive the entire time and once we showed that we understood why she was so flustered she actually got more comfortable. But still, who trains staff to not write down orders while I'm SURE newbies are still learning the menu? Regardless, the food was still great. Shrimp ceviche I highly recommend as well as the Ahi Salad."}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was horrible and they were not that busy! All the girls look really slutty. We did find a hair in our food. Not the most recommended."}
{"text":"So I've been to Sandbar like a million times in Scottsdale but I have never been to the one in Peoria, AZ. I have 1 friend who is always bugging me to go to \"her side of town.\" I decided to venture out there the other night and it was totally worth it! Every night of the week has different drinks and dinner deals. We went on a Wednesday which was open mic night. It was so cool watching different bands and people singing their songs. After that they had their resident DJ (which they do several nights a week) and he was awesome. It was so fun to get out of the usual scene. There is always something new and exciting going on so I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"SCAM WARNING!!!! THEY WILL SELL YOUR ID!  A few years ago my (then) friend stole my ID since she was underage and I had just turned 21. I found out from mutual friends that she went to Sandbar at Desert Ridge on a Friday night and used my ID. The ID was confiscated because she apparently couldn't recall what the address was.   When I found out about the incident, I figured Sandbar would do the responsible thing and turn it over to the authorities, contact me or shred it.   Turns out, the security guard that took the ID had pocketed it and SOLD MY ID to one of their under aged friends!!!!!   I contacted Sandbar with all the evidence and proof and they gave me the run around. I had been calling the manager daily for almost two weeks. I left voicemails and never received a call back or apology, they never owned up to selling my ID. I even came in with my father one morning 15 minutes before opening and was told the manager was \"unavailable\" to speak with me.   I have not been back since and this was 3 years ago. I just want to warn others to stay away from this place. What they have done is ILLEGAL and I don't support UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES!"}
{"text":"This used to be a fun place.   Now the service isn't great,  if you lose something there the staff won't look for it.   We rented a cabana and couldn't get service all night.  What's the point."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great music and drinks ! My only complaint was the pool. It felt almost gelatinous, and had a smell that I couldn't quite place. At one point I thought I saw bunnies and bird in the pool, but it could of been the great drinks playing tricks in me. I'm just glad I survived :)"}
{"text":"This place looks really nice from the outside, and once entering is when it all changes. The service is terrible, I had the most ditzy girl ever, she was not friendly and was spending her time flirting with other guys. I can see management only hired her for her looks obviously... I ordered a chicken burrito, came back with a steak burrito. She took too long to check back on us so I ended up starting to eat it simply because I was too hungry to wait 30 minutes for her to stop talking to the guys she was eating food off of. Then I mentioned that I asked for a chicken burrito, and she said she could only give me 15% off when there was clearly over half the plate still full. Then we asked to split the check in half because we shared an appetizer(which was full because it tasted poorly also) and she was unable to do it. I've been to many places and they are able to split the check in half. Anyways, don't waste your time here unless you're a goodlooking male in your early 20's because the girls care about no one else."}
{"text":"I have been WAITING to review this place because of all the different opinions on these reviews. I didn't have any food so I can't really comment on that but the drinks were good and strong. People were very nice. Outside was interesting...never seen sand lots in a bar, but the fact that they have an outside bar as well as inside was great! I was there on a UFC fight night so it got pretty busy as it got closer but the bartender was always very attentive and waitresses came to check on us frequently. I didn't get to stay for this epic loud obnoxious DJ or the other bad things that have been said about night time but it looks like this place could be such a good time!"}
{"text":"Food was good, music very loud and the service  nonexistent. Once our entrees arrived the server never came to our table to ensure our orders were correct or inquire if we needed anything. Our lunch was about 70% complete when she finally appeared at our table reeking of cigarette smoke and inquired if my husband would like another glass of wine.  She ignored the fact my drink was completely empty and turned to leave. We had to stop her and request a refill of my Diet Coke.  Maybe less time smoking and more attention to your customers and there would be four stars!"}
{"text":"One of the male bussers decided that it was okay to set their dirty bus tub on our table. I understand that it was probably heavy, but I do feel that was completely inappropriate, and a tad bit rude, and not to mention extremely unsanitary."}
{"text":"I totally dig the outdoor bar, sand, puddle and the crew.  Happy hour, misting spray, and mini chimi's too, YUMMY!  The manager can be a tool at times but overall this place is a cool hang. If your over 35, you may want to stay away from Friday nights. However, the special events, UFC, Cinco De Mayo, Etc, are awesome."}
{"text":"This is a generous three stars.  I don't get it.  This restaurant has mediocre Mexican food but the prices are reasonable. Every time I've been here the service has been terrible and this includes going for lunch when they weren't very busy. On one occasion my chips and salsa showed up after my entree was served and I'm still waiting on that drink refill.  They do have a patio. But, it's right on Tatum Blvd. If your idea of a beach style patio includes thousands of vehicles whizzing by then you have found your place.  I guess the draw here is the bar.  I wandered in with some friends one evening and the place was hopping. It was loud, crowded and packed with 20-somethings. For me, it was too loud, too crowded, and I've outgrown that \"go out and get wasted\" phase. But, if you're into that sort of thing - go for it."}
{"text":"Horrible service and bland food... I would tell the waitress if she would come back. Took her 30 min and I had to finally tell her we would like some chip and salsa and would like to order our meal. The only positive was the 100 TVs for sports. For an average of $12 a plate I expect more."}
{"text":"typical crowded and loud place with expensive drinks.  I've been in a few times to this location, and typically i would have given this place a couple more stars (not four more, but a couple).  After my visit last night, i will most likely never be returning.  Last evening i got off work where i serve alcohol and food stuffs to people, my boyfriend picked me up and we headed to sandbar to unwind and enjoy the rest of our evening.  We arrived around eleven in the evening, and my boyfriend bought me a vodka sprite.  We proceeded to dance and have fun when a bouncer approached my boyfriend and told him he had to get me out of there, but he could come back, obviously my boyfriend left with me.  i had had ONE drink!!!! now i know i can be exuberant sometimes, and im not a great dancer, but i was not by any means drunk!! nor was i causing any problems or even talking to anyone besides my boyfriend!!!  i feel insulted and i am even more shocked, because the past few times I've been there i have seen people who were clearly over served!!  i highly doubt i will ever return to this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been to dive bars and I been to bars which are way classier than Sandbar. But one thing that is common between all those bars is that they provide service worth your money. The drinks at Sandbar are so diluted that I would rather have had just a soda. The servers seems to be very stubborn and do not know how to treat the customers and make their experience a good one. Big NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"}
{"text":"This past weekend I had an excellent experience at Sandbar.  My two friends and I all enjoyed the happy hour prices available until 7 all weekend.  The food was delicious with reasonable prices. Our waitress was great and very helpful as this was our first visit to sandbar.  Fun atmosphere!  Would recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my family...  taco salad was more like soup. I'm assuming when they rinsed the lettuce they didn't pour the water off. Our appetizers came after our meals"}
{"text":"The hostesses are not good... They are teenage girls that don't even know where open tables are or if they have any. When asking a question about the out door seating one who was dressed very inappropriately chimed in with a snide remark. The wait staff is hit and miss. Sometimes you get a good one some times you don't. The atmosphere is good, nice television set up for watching sports. The music is good, but even during the day don't expect to have a conversation over it. The food is pretty good. I would highly recommend the nachos. This seems to be a prime example of an establishment that can't descide if it wants to be a restaurant or a night club."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure when it came to kids with this place, but today I brought the youngsters In. Best decision, today was kids eat free. They loved the sand And the lights. Hostess were very nice, gave them balloons!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Server at the Sandbar,  \"Yes\" is the correct answer to the question\"does your guacamole have cilantro in it?\"  Your answer \"no it totally doesn't\", along with the lighting that rendered me unable to see said guacamole, led to me waking up the next day with eyes swelled shut!  Thanks for that.  Also, and this is just a bonus tip, if a customer outright tells you they are allergic to cilantro, you might want to ask the kitchen not to sprinkle it over EVERYTHING ON THE PLATE! You see I, the customer, am blissfully unaware of what the kitchen uses to garnish plates.  You, the server, should not be!  So maybe you could hook a sister up and ask them to leave it off.  I did, after all, tell you I was allergic to it less than 2 minutes ago.  This might help with your tips.  With warmest regards, and no bitterness whatsoever, Steph"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food or mixed drinks!   I went with a few friends for my 1st time around midnight on a Friday!  Music was very good, crowd seemed very cool, loved the indoor/outdoor setup, beers weren't insanely priced like Chicago Club type settings, Vibe was great. No cover charge. A place I'd go back to until convinced otherwise.  Felt very comfortable with the age group there. Seemed like 20s and 30s."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The food is exceptional and our server, Devon is attentive, efficient and friendly. The prickly pear margarita is the best in the Valley (IMHO). And the tacos! Taco Tuesdays really are amazing because the quality is still there with the reduced price. But, the tacos at dinner can make the meal.  All around, I recommend for a casual dining experience. Awesome!"}
{"text":"First time for my wife and I at the Sandbar. What a pleasant surprise! Great Service, Great Food, Great Atmosphere 2 Entrees with appetizers and 2 frozen Margaritas was $65.00 Including the $15.00 tip. Big Bang for the Buck! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do NOT use your credit card at this place.  I left my credit card at the bar and realized it the next morning.  I called and they confirmed that the card was there.  I called a few days later to make sure it was okay to send my husband to pick up the card.  They said as long as I gave him my license, it was fine.  That wasn't the case when he got there.  He wasted 30 minutes because the manager said due to liability, they couldn't give him my card... regardless of what his employee said.  I was extremely frustrated, especially since he was not willing to work with me at all.  I told him that I was disappointed because I could have sent whatever proof they needed, even skyped for proof and if I would have known he couldn't pick up the card, I wouldn't have wasted his time.  I even asked if they could mail the card and he said no. I sent a letter explaining my frustration and never heard back. So a few days later, I drive out to Chandler myself only to find out that my card was missing.  No one could find it but they promised to call me that day.  2 weeks later, still no card and no call.  And even though they acknowledged that they received my letter while I was there, they never responded. I called today to learn that they cut up the cards after a week because so many people  leave their cards there.  Sooooo frustrated, not with the policy, but it seems their employees should know the policy.  It would have saved me two trips, totaling an hour of wasted time and frustration.  If you MUST go to this place, use cash."}
{"text":"Great place. Big thumbs up... I had the carne asada faijtas and they where the best I have ever had. The atmosphere was great, really relaxing yet hip at the same time. The cheap drink specials, great servers,  good music, and great food will keep me coming to the sandbar."}
{"text":"Server was very friendly. The only issue with this place, is it being packed! I had to order my food twice (No onions) first time they messed it up, of course no biggie! But the second time it only came back with cilantro. I still wanted the salsa, radishes, and cabbage that came along with the tacos. I didn't want to keep the table waiting so took them as was. No silverware, or napkins on the table what so ever. We had to eat the order of wings with our hands. Water only came towards the end of our meal, as we wer set to leave. Unfortunately I don't see us returning anytime soon, or recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food wasn't anything special...Medium size portions but nothing I couldn't have gotten anywhere else. Didn't really leave a lasting impression!"}
{"text":"LOVE this bar/restaurant. first, it's extrememly cool with an indoor and outdoor venues. they open a large glass wall so you feel like you are part of the outside. the inside is full of beautiful large tvs from every angle for every sports lover. it's done in a tropical them. the outside has a large bar with seating on all four sides of the bar. there's numerous tables outside, private cabanas, misters, dirt all over the floor, and a grill where they cook up chicken and carne asada tacos. it resembles an indoor / outdoor restuarant/bar that you would exprience in the tropics. they have happy hour every single day til 7pm. they have reduced priced appetizers for $5 each including my favorite calamari. if you like your wings hot, and i mean hot, this is the place for you. the wings are much larger then most places. they have a full menu ranging from mexican food, american food, and seafood. their drinks are cheap. bottles on happy hour are $2.00. mixed drinks are also reduced. all of the food i've gotten here is good. the appetizers are awesome and i generally go for the reduced priced appetizers. so, it;s a very cool place. tropically themed. you can sit outside in the misters and feel like you're on a beech. they have different specials every day including $1.50 tacos, $5 angus burgers & fries, and others. Go here for the good cheap food, cheap beers $2.00 and catch a game on one of their many large tvs. this is my favorite spot and i'm never disappointed. you also don't need to reserve a private cabana. there are comfortable couches and chairs in the cabanas with private tvs. the outside is very cool. you really do think you're in the tropics somewhere.  ok, new update as of today, sept 15, still love this bar/restaurant, however, they stopped having their reduced priced appetizers on saturdays and sundays. this is one major reason i love this place since alot of bars/restaurants don't do 1/2 off or reduced appetizers on weekends. they stopped because of football. still have their specials during the week. so, during a sunday game, i'd go to rt osullivans, 35cent wings, cheap drinks, giant tvs, another 5 star place."}
{"text":"First off, don't go here unless you like being treated like trash. My group and I came here for the first time on a Friday night. Our waitress comes to the table to take drink orders, I am waiting my turn making eye contact with her she says \"okay I'll be right out with those drinks\" and walks away...without taking my order but took everyone else's....okay? Benefit of the doubt here, maybe she was busy and just got mixed up. Then she just places a water in front of me and walks away again, I tried to get her attention with no luck. She finally comes back to our table to check on everyone and I am able to tell her I would like to order a drink. She didn't ask me what I would like she just stood there and stared at me....okay? I told her which drink I would like and she asked for my I.D.....okay? But she didn't ask for anyone else's I.D at our table? But sure fine maybe I look a little young. I give her my I.D and she switches back and forth looking at the I.D and me for a couple minutes before just setting it down on the table and walking away. Then it took forever for the drink to get there. When I asked for a water it took her about 20 minutes just to bring it to me and it was only filled up once more before we left. Drinks were overpriced for the quality and quantity. The food was so overpriced for the looks of the quality that we didn't even bother ordering food, not that our waitress gave us that choice or opportunity. Then she closed out one of our friends tabs before he was ready, without asking and just brought him his check. But it took everyone else at the table another 40 minutes just to pay so we could leave! Bouncers were pushy and rude, bumped into us multiple times and gave us dirty looks. Maybe this was just my particular experience. Maybe I just had bad luck with the server we got put with. Or maybe this place is just flat out awful. If I could rate no stars, I really would. You couldn't pay me enough to come back here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the food/drinks and the staff are excellent. It's a great place for some night life but without the craziness of dealing with Old Town. It's always busy whether it's mid week evening or a Saturday night but not too much that it's overwhelming. Can get pretty loud sometimes on game days. Also, they make a killer margarita! Love, love sandbar!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is awesome here! Place is delicious. Great amount of beers as well. The atmosphere is great. Patron bottles as the hanging lights, the colors are great, the bartenders are hot!! Haha the outside seating is on a bank of sand which is pretty cool. Overall I enjoy this place to catch the football game or just to grab a few brews with some friends. Service lacked a little last night but it's a bar... Good bar though."}
{"text":"Went last with a group of 14 friends. We had just had dinner at Keg which is right across the parking lot. Sandbar has a fun atmosphere, efficient service, reasonable drink prices and fun music!"}
{"text":"I have given this place plenty of chances.  I am now officially done.   I am tired of the mouthy little prima donnas behind the bar.  I have received all the lip im going to take from these little brainless pimples.   The food is okay for a bar, the music is almost bearable.  But the attitude and service is SUBPAR."}
{"text":"Rude staff crappy food and the manager doesn't give a crap. This place is off the list and there are so many great other places in the area. I'd rate it a Zero or a negative if yelp would let me. Look for this joint to be vacant in a few short months.   Do yourself a favor and find someplace else."}
{"text":"We like the nachos and icy cold beer glasses. Our server, James, was friendly and attentive. This bar has a good vibe with mostly 80's music. A regular stop for us in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of food here. Carne Asada is supposed to be seared, not charred. Sent it back once, got it back the same way. Girlfriend got the ahi (tuna) tacos, got Scombroid food poisoning...   Furthermore, our waitress had little to no clue about the items on the menu, and came once during the main course, despite working on silverware 5 feet away from my table."}
{"text":"I never disliked this place until I met the so-called owner or who was posing as one on new year's eve. His name was Jared - short and bald. I checked the list of board of members and he wasn't on it. What pissed me and my friends off was his less than human comments about colored people.. I felt like smacking him right in the face but had to control myself to enjoy and not ruin my new years. I hope the board/management knows that he is hurting their business reputation."}
{"text":"Great food. I ordered huevos rancheros from their brunch menu and I really enjoyed them. They aerve big portions and the food ia very tasty. Great specials and the staff seems friendly."}
{"text":"Here at the sandbar right now great tacos awesome prices. Dre is a great bartender friendly, great personality and quick!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot to get good, cheap margaritas after work and a snack. The music was really loud where we were sitting so it was hard to hear each other, but the service was great. We had an attentive, friendly waitress and chips with cheese dip that was yummy. The patio and cabanas look like a fantastic spot to hang out when it is not 115 degrees. : ) Good pick for after a long day at the office!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere if you're under 40. Look like a place to pick up chick's.  I don't think you should be allowed to smoke at the bar! Yes it's out door but should still have an designated area for smoking."}
{"text":"I'm amazed it's always filled but the food is less than top of the line.  Slow service and a bit disorganized.  But wait staff was friendly enough.  Less than comfortable seating on the patio but guess that's my choice in sitting outside or inside."}
{"text":"Was there for 20 minutes, people ate, drank and left and the bartender never wiped off the bar surface! The tap beer was cloudy, that makes it questionable in my opinion. So I left never t return."}
{"text":"Ok.....I go to the Sandbar quite a bit. I went today and I could not believe how loud it was. Being a sports bar, I get that it will be loud. This was a different kind of loud. I could not hear my husband sitting 12 inches away from me. Even my teen kids were holding their ears. It was seriously WAY TOO LOUD. My ears were ringing when I left. I ordered the mexican pizza that cost me $10 and was literally a burned tortilla with beans, meat and lettuce. That was it. The server was great, but she had a hard time hearing our orders HENCE it was too loud. I don't think I will ever go back. Bummer, because I live so close and it could be a really fun place."}
{"text":"If u want to watch sports, sit outside in cute cabanas it's great. The tacos r good. Had the carnita tacos. Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Late review...Super busy night. Hostess Cat and Paige were informative and kept is us posted. Appetizer platter way yummy and the tacos were great. It is a nice to watch sports and eat great food."}
{"text":"The sandbar is always a good place to go, but I would recommend not going on Mondays when Mercedes is working! Takes about 20 mins to get a beer when she has 3 groups of four people max."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, the carne asada tacos on flour tortillas were really great.  Also had chips and guac which were good also.  Went with a friend and she had the same thing, both of us loved it, seriously good carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. I went in with a friend of mine after having 4 drinks for me, my friend had zero. Zero drinks. We were there for 10 minutes, I couldn't even finish one drink, that's how quickly this happened. All of the sudden the bouncers approached my friend who was standing directly next to me and watching the tvs and doing nothing. They asked him to follow them out and walked him to the parking lot and said he was acting like he was overserved.He was sober. He was doing nothing. He is, however, brown. An MIT and Stanford educated Doctor, who happens to be Indian, and sober, but he got kicked out. This is the most disgusting display of racism. This bar is awful. Meanwhile, I'm a blonde girl who was actually less sober than I should have been and proceeded to yell at them, all the way out the bar. I didn't get kicked out. L"}
{"text":"Quick Sand or Sand Trap? By The Rue  Sandbar, Sandbar I know your trick, It isn't the food that gets me to stick, It wasn't the fajita burrito with chicken inside, It is the yummy workers I must confide.  I'm not sure my waitresses name, I'll have to come back when I have more game, Of course I'm not telling the truth, I was raised right and have more couth.  Going off topic, back to the review, The selection is decent on their menu, I wasn't a big fan of the rice and beans, Both were lacking in this cuisine.  The icead tea was good and filled up often, I was never a big fan of Kenny Loggins, This is the first time that I've been here, Didn't even have time to order a beer.  I certainly want to come here for happy hour, I'll probably have a beer not a whiskey and sour, The patio seems like a fun place to chill, Next time write your number on my bill.   Bump, Set, SPIKE!!!"}
{"text":"Swung by here a couple times this past week and had an awesome time. I bet it's a blast for happy hour and a good place to catch the game. I came a bit later both times for drinks with friends... service was good, booze was pretty cheap for a nicer place, the decor and layout were spot-on, and the ambiance was fun. Definitely will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever seen. Wow, please just save your time and go to the yard house!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is average..places average ...really depends what you're looking for it's really more of a bar for youngsters."}
{"text":"Pretty much just like Salty's but a little better, minus the sand volleyball. Half the it is outside, its got some sand and little toddler pool thingy.  I think the cover was $6, mixed drinks $8, shots $5, beers $3. If you order tequila and they ask you what kind, don't say surprise me. Dude, gave me some nasty tequila idk what kind it was but I've never hated tequila before, and smelled funny too. One bartender girl (a blonde with short hair) was rude she kept making weird faces when I walked up, ordered, and when I was talking with my friend, like I was offending her with my prescience idk what her problem was (maybe she had tourettes ?).  So my next drink I went all the way to the other side of the bar where all the crowds were to order. The dance floor is like a tiny pig pen thing that people cram themselves into, their all sweaty and bumping into each other, it sounds hot, but its quite funny to watch.  If a waitress comes around offering shots for $3 bucks don't bother they are super weak, not even tasty either. I did see a couple cute girls tho. The outside area offers a good place to talk with friends."}
{"text":"I'm going to say, YES to this place.  My husband suggested it before, but since we don't live close to it, we figure that if we are close to the area we must try it... and happy, really happy we are... the food was good, and plenty of it... I will say that if you are on a diet, you must share...  cause is alot.  didn't have any alcohol drinks because I'm on Weight Watchers and didn't research points for drinks.  Service was good, not amazing, but quick... I will say, you mush visit...either be with friends, love ones...or on your first date..."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for happy hour and I really wish I'd spent my money elsewhere. The atmosphere was awful, the chips tasted like cardboard and it was constantly difficult to get the waitresses's attention. The place was packed and we were stuck in a booth in a back corner which was FREEZING cold. I was not a fan of the crowd, the music, the location, the food. I've experienced worse, but this was pretty bad. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Untrained HARASSING security at Sandbar Desert Ridge. I went here last night with my girlfriend to watch the Mayweather fight. I paid $20 dollars to get us both in as a cover charge and then ordered an overpriced $10 cocktail. After about 10 minutes I noticed my psycho ex girlfriend was also there. She soon noticed me and started following me around the bar grabbing on to my waist as I was walking. I told her to get off me and repeatedly pushed her off as she kept on trying to grab me. I immediately went to security and told them that the girl was harassing me and for them to watch her. About 5 minutes later some overweight bald bouncer asked me to step outside while they investigated the situation. I explained what was going on and I was very frustrated as I was the one who initially reported the incident to security. Instead of investigating the situation with both parties or viewing the security cameras they kicked me out because I asked to talk to someone in charge (The security guard didn't like that I wanted to talk to someone who actually had some intelligence). Worst bar experience ever! I couldn't even have security's help when I specifically asked for it. It's not always the females getting harassed in the bars fellas. Now a days there should be equally security for both sexes and I don't appreciate being kicked out after I was the victim who seeked help. Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"I went here because I was attending a bachelor and.bachelorette party.Well, the food is bland, but they know how to make drinks. However, halfway through our meal they opened the doors and the cigarette smoke drifted into the restaurant .I didnt finish my meal due to the horrible atmosphere.  If I wanted to stick my head in an ashtray I would do so. This is a horrible way to treat non smokers."}
{"text":"Such a good place to go to lunch or have meetings. Most of the food is pretty good and nothing is too pricey, perfect to hang out."}
{"text":"Been here on a few occasions. but just joined Yelp so figured i'd write a review. We live in the area so try to frequent the businesses in our 'hood. Sandbar is what it is i suppose. cheap drinks during Happy Hour and OK(ish) food. Fun place to day drink at times. I dont go to Sandbar expecting to be wowed by the product or service, so for what it is, its a decent bar.   Pro: cheap happy drinks, day drinking cons: food average at best, nothing \"special\" about the place."}
{"text":"I came for my friends birthday. A few of us were sitting at 3 different tables near each other.  My friend was sitting by herself nearest to one of the cabanas by the entrance. A big group of people came in for the Iowa game. The gm named Stephen Howard came up to them and said their cabana wasn't ready yet and basically offered them the table my friend was already sitting at. He told her the table was reserved and she would have to move. We were all confused because that table definitely didn't have a reservation sign on it. He removed all her food from the table and said she can sit at another table. She said she will not be sitting at another table and the general manager proceeded to act like a jerk towards her. We asked for the name of his boss and he was so rude about it grabbing out his phone and told us the name of his boss was Jeff O'Neil and we could go ahead and \"put the number in our phones if we want\" Then when my friends did not back down he finally calmed down and he explained that their TV guy was supposed to be here in the morning to set up the TVs in the cabana and just got there so he needed to seat those people for the Iowa game until the TV guy was done which should take like 20 more minutes then we could have the table back. Which is still no excuse for kicking someone off a table that they were rightfully sitting at but at least he finally explained. It was just a frustrating situation on my friends Bday no less. We all felt extremely uncomfortable after we were having a great time. On top of having to pay 10 dollars to watch the fight when a majority of the TVs only showed the Iowa game all night. The waitress we had was great and checked on us all night. But I have been coming to sandbar for years and will never be coming back if that's how the general manager is going to treat people."}
{"text":"Though I come here often, its not for the food, more so fir the atmosphere. I almost feel like I'm in Mexico (we always sit outside). Though I think the minimum for a cabana is a joke (I believe someone mentioned a $250 min. No wonder why they're typically empty; the one's who pay are probably too drunk to realize the rip off).  Taco Tuesday and Ladies Night on Thursday's are always a hit in my book. Us ladies sit out and laugh for hours. Thursday's is 1/2 off appetizers and drinks all night. I'm usually stuffed so much when I leave that I'm sick (my own fault).  The waitresses are extremely slow. I'm talkingpace. I typically luck up and get Amanda if she's there (she's a super star!). Anyone else and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for places, but I have been here several times and been helped by Darrien (female bartender) several times and have received amazingly fast & friendly service each time. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"For the most part my evening here was a good experience.  Service was decent and the food was good, and sitting on the patio with a cold beer and a plate of nachos (as an appetizer) was great. But, I ordered the coconut shrimp for dinner and while the shrimp itself was good, I don't like that I paid $10 for a plate that contained 4 medium sized shrimp and nothing else.  No side dishes at all, just 4 shrimp. As an appetizer for one person it would have been okay,  at happy hour peices, but not for a meal."}
{"text":"I went to pick up my brother and his friends who were too drunk to drive home. The staff physically assaulted them, ripping their shirts and pushing them around and brandished stun guns keeping them from leaving the parking lot to get to where I was waiting for them. I was working late at my office in the same parking lot as the bar. I was walking to meet them and saw this unbelievable behavior. If you want to take the chance of going where they give way too much power and stun guns to untrained, egomaniacs; enjoy the sandbar. It was obviously a bunch of idiots working there who like the excitement of a fight and they were clearly trying to provoke one."}
{"text":"We went here for a large group function, and the indoor/outdoor environment was nice, and it was easy to mingle. The served some apps of chips and guac and they were good. The entree and salad, not so much. We definitely didn't come here for the food, it was less than mediocre, however, we were a big group and serving in that volume can tax the best kitchens. But, it was a fun place for our group, despite the food."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst dining experiences I have had since moving to the Valley a year ago. The restaurant was extremely loud (music) at 6:00. The drunk patron next to us was so loud I couldn't even hear myself talk. The food was sub-par at best and the portions were extremely small. The waitress, while friendly, was almost non-existent. Other than taking our order, she stopped back one other time, we asked for an additional condiment, and it took several more minutes before she meandered back to us. We got all that misery and lousy food for $40.00. Definitely not worth it, I will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"HATED it!  Took the kids with us to try it out as we live in the neighborhood; had never been to a Sandbar before. It was busy, turned out to be Ladies Night, so lots of tables of desperate guys looking for 'dates' among the heavily-perfumed 'ladies'.  We should've left, but at that point were famished, so we sat outside (the only table available). The kids liked the sand and the water feature. We, on the other hand, were truly disappointed.  If we were in our 20s, single, chain-smoked Camels (like the guy next to us) and wanted a night on the town, it maybe could work.  But as a local dinner place for a family, no way (not even at 5 PM).  Service was horrible; we ordered a $5 bucket of chips because we were so hungry, but our entrees came BEFORE the chips. It took at least ten minutes to get our drinks.  My husband got a draft beer; I got a bottle, with no glass.  We asked for a glass, from both our ditzy server and the harried busboys; said glass never came. The food was passable to decent.  Hubbie had tacos; I had fish tacos, which had more sauce than fish and tasted a bit mayonaisse-y.  The high point was when the kids dipped their legs in the water; and I liked the colorful chairs on the patio. Other than that, we will most likely never go back--which is a shame, as we like to eat out, frequently, in our Desert Ridge neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went to see a movie with the hubby today and decided to stop and get some lunch before,we had a choice between the sandbar and blu burger, I made the wrong choice! Dont get me wrong ive been to the sandbar at night on the weekend and I loved it but I didnt eat anything those times and frankly I didnt even know they served food during the day.Anyways so we show up and its kind of weird looking around this place while its light outside! But we are seated at a booth by the kitchen.....I hate sitting by the kitchen! not because I think im better than anyone else but because I dont like people looking at me when I eat, I usually have food falling out of my mouth or something when the servers look at me lol.I ordered the chicken chimi and the hubby ordered a steak burrito, they both came with rice and beans, I thought we would get some chips and salsa to munch on but that didnt happen,the drink glasses are big so you dont have to get a million refills.when our food arrived I looked at it and knew it was going to be horrible.the chimi had no sauce on it and just a little bit of melted mozzarella cheese on top....mozzarella on mexican food? then I looked at the rice and laughed,the rice they use is like the lipton mexican rice you get in the grocery store,I actually think thats what they use! the beans were flavorless and had more mozzarella cheese on them, come on people! the chimi was ok,not very much flavor and not very good.Now there are mexicans cooking this food I wonder what they think about this.the hubby liked his burrito though......not much coming from him though because he liked the rice! my hubby is a total white boy and im guessing thats why he liked it! Now im white also but I lived with a mexican family for 6 years so I know what REAL mexican food is and that  is what I expect when I go to a mexican restaurant,That didnt happen here and I will never go back here.....to eat that is!  so if you like totally Americanized mexican restaurants you may like the sandbar but if you actually know what real mexican food looks and tastes like your going to be very very disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice atmosphere. It has a beach theme going on, with sand on the patio, tables shaped like surf boards, and two canopies on either end of the patio. Food was great as well. My only complaint would be the service is very poor, we waited for quite some time before anyone even acknowledged us and our waiter was not friendly. Also, we wanted to sit on the patio for the beach atmosphere but the smoking on the patio is very bothersome for those who don't smoke!"}
{"text":"I love coming here often. During the day for lunch it has a more laid back restaurant vibe, but weekends is where the fun is at! I love the fact that they have a live dj playing music constantly. It does get quite busy, as would any bar on the weekends. But this place is so much fun! The servers are nice and I've never had any problems. Definitely need to check this place out with a group of friends on a friday and saturday night!"}
{"text":"I come here any given time but if you're coming here to watch a UFC go elsewhere. I left and came back within 20 minutes and your cover for the fight increased $5. That's fairly arrogant and there aren't any signs showing that your cover for fights is on a sliding scale. I've never heard of that before and there simply to many other free options to see UFC fights."}
{"text":"The chips are awesome.  That said, the food is ok... but the chips are awesome!  Went for lunch.  The burrito was ok but just ordinary, nothing special.  The taco salad again good, but nothing special.  Did I mention the chips?  The chips and the green salsa were great.  The chips were a bit thicker than normal, so they had a great 'meaty' crunch.  That probably doesn't make much sense, oh well.  The service was also great.  I think the best bet for lunch is on Tuesdays.  They have $2 tacos on Tuesdays.  A couple tacos along with the chips and salsa... yep sounds good!"}
{"text":"Sandbar has a lot going for it but a few shortcomings.   First off, we seated ourselves because the hostess was absent. The waitress did not offer the happy hour specials because we were 5 minutes early.. (bad policy). The waitress then asked me to throw away my brand new coffee because their policy says customers cannot bring their own beverages in.. (terrible policy).   I ordered a burger and a water. The food took quite a while (around 40 minutes), even though it was very slow. I was fine with that but then the burger was very dry and sort of flat tasting.   The waitress seemed to be in a sour mood as well, maybe because she sensed my disappointment. This was the first time I have tried Sandbar but I would not return unless all I wanted to do was drink. The place seemed cool for a large drunk get together but that is all. Bad service, bad policies, and so far bad food."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on Sandbar as a nightlife spot, I didn't eat there, just drank, heavily, and danced, heavily, and based on my few moments of clarity between shots these are my thoughts....  Sandbar offers some great music and a dance floor to get your groove on.  It's only been open a week so it was packed! If you don't get there before 10 pm expect to wait in a long line and not find a table to park your drinks at.  The ambience is very cool and it is pretty big, there actually are a lot of tables both inside and out. There are 4 cabanas on the outside patio that you can reserve if you have a large group and promise to spend at least $300, which is very easy to do with a large group. The sand and small pool are a nice touch, I did get a little sand in my shoes but didn't mind one bit. The dance floor isn't huge but it doesn't get too packed we always found a spot to comfortably shake our groove things, the DJ plays hip hop, some rock and even a little country while they show the videos on the flat screens, they even played SNL's digital short On a Boat with Andy Samberg & T-Pain which is very danceable and very hilarious.    Now we did have a few issues but I think it's based on the fact that this place is new and so so packed and management did try to make amends so I'm not going to knock them too much for it. It was my sister's birthday so we called in advance to reserve a cabana for the night but then they called us back a day later and said they had actually overbooked so we no longer had the cabana, we then made reservations for dinner but once we got there they did not have a spot for us to sit, they had anticipated another big party would leave before we got there and they did not, so we had to go somewhere else for food, but the manager offered my sister free drinks when we came back later and they did reserve us some high tops by the dance floor when we came back so that was nice. We never had to wait too long for our waitress to come back around and offer more drinks either, another plus.  Also because it is so packed there is more of a possibility of having a few knucklheads in the crowd, we actually saw a fight early in the night, small and squashed quickly. Then later in the evening some drunky tried to fight a guy in our group, I think this drunky had little man complex and he was in the crowd and he bumped into our friend at the same time that someone else bumped into him so he thought our friend purposely bumped him. Our friend was actually the designated driver so he was completely sober and the drunk 5 foot tall guy tried to fight the sober 6 foot tall guy who kept telling him to walk away, which he did, only to come back later with his 5 1/2 foot tall friend to avenge him. It was all stupid and the management could see that it was just two drunk guys trying to prove they weren't scared of the big guy and they kicked the knuckleheads out and let us stay.  The night was saved and we actually stayed until the last song at 2 a.m. chit chatting and dancing the night away.  I will definitely go back, maybe not for a few weeks when it isn't so crowded but with it being one of the few dance spots in Chandler this probably won't happen any time soon, which is good for them. We went on a Saturday but I've heard Friday is just as packed."}
{"text":"So I was gonna meet my co workers here for a pregame drinking party before our company party at Dave and busters. I was the first one to arrive and waited 22 minutes before a server finally came over and said how can I help you. I refused service saying I've been here for 22 minutes. All she said was \"I apologize, what can I get you to drink\" I said I was gonna bring my party somewhere else and she didn't even care. I talked to a manager and didn't even offer to buy a round of drinks or take care of us at all. It's like they don't care and all that takes to serving is to look pretty. I've been a server for 6 years and I would dance circles against any of the servers at sandbar. Save your money and go somewhere else where they care about guests. I wish there was a negative star rating!!!"}
{"text":"Met some friends who were hanging out on a Saturday afternoon. The place has a nice vibe, with the indoor seating area open to the outside with lots of fans and a great escape from the heat. It does feel like you are in on vacation when you are there.   Our friends were hanging out in a cabana and when it came close to 5pm, we were told the the space was reserved for another party. We asked how much they were and they said it was a $300 min. - WTH! More amazing is that people pay it! You know you are in Chandler right?   Corona's were $5! of course you are going to have a mexican import beer when you are at a Mexican bar - so they have no pity in the price! No specials on the weekends. Did not eat, but had some chips and salsa. They tasted as expected. Do not expect fantastic mexican food at this place - just something to feed you while you enjoy the decor and expensive drinks.   The service was good and the scene was alot of people hanging out with some Cougars prowling. If they made my wallet feel more welcomed and the food look better, I would visit again."}
{"text":"I had never been to the Sand Bar before, decided to eat here to sit outside and Mexican food. The food was pretty good but the service was horrible.  We to had lunch on Saturday. It was not real busy. No one available to seat us and eventually was told to sit anywhere.  No one gave us any menus or even took our drink order.  It's pretty bad when customers at tables next to ours have to tell a waitress (who was busy flirting with two guys) that we were waiting for service.  She replied it wasn't her section. Apparently we chose the busiest section. It took 15 minutes to get menus and a very long time to get our food order. I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"I have only been to the Scottsdale location so when a girlfriend suggested the Desert Ridge location for our Girls Night I said why not?! On Saturday morning I spoke to an acquaintance on Facebook about getting a cabana & got it all set up. Fast forward to later that night around 11pm when me & a couple of my girlfriends finally show up. There's a line of course, (Cinco de Mayo weekend & some band was playing) but I let them know I had a cabana reserved under my name so we got to bypass the line & didn't have to pay cover either. We get to the cabana & there are about 12 girls already there. I didn't know about half of them but whatev! Our server (never got her name) was sweet but very shy/quiet & sometimes reallllllly slow about getting us our drink orders & when we wanted to cash out. It was so packed that night & there were so many douche bags running around, that I was pretty much confined to our cabana. Thankfully my girls can keep me entertained because I had a great time! I ordered vodka cranberries all night which seemed weak at first, until I started ordering doubles. Needless to say I got pretty drunk after my 4th drink. Since we booked a cabana our group had to spend a combined total of $450, my bill came out to $63 & I left her $85. I just hope the other bitches in my group tipped her well also! Btw, I put my debit card down to start my tab but when I closed out I paid with cash. I checked my bank account online today & it showed a charge for Sandbar pending. I called them to see why it was still there & they said it should be gone within the next 3 days. Kind of annoying but understandable & just an FYI to anyone else who puts a card down but pays in cash. Any way, a lot of my friends like it here so I'm sure I'll be back eventually!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for my waiter and mediocre food, I would have given this place 1 star, and only 1 star because that's the minimum.   I completely understand wanting to keep minors away from the areas with a bar, or even the whole restaurant entirely. However, if you're going to do that, make it clear.   I walked in, looking for my friends who had already walked in literally 5 mins before me. (We're all underage) As I stood by the door, waiting to see where they had been seated, the security guards at the door were completely rude to me. They asked me for ID, at which I was confused because this is also a restaurant. They asked if I was underage, to which I immediately responded yes, and asked if that were a problem. (Which I assumed would not be since my other friends who are even younger than I am, got in without an issue; we just graduated high school if that gives you an idea of our age) The security guard then said \"you have until 10.\" I got there at 8...   Anyway, the people at the door completely ruined my experience. I will never come back, even when I am of legal age because of how completely unacceptably rude their staff is."}
{"text":"I went to Sandbar the other night and I had a good time. My friend got off work at 10:30 pm so we had to find a place that would stay open a little later. We enjoyed Sandbar. We had drinks on the outdoor patio, played ski ball inside, and had fun both talking to the servers and customers. The martinis I had were strong but well done and the service was prompt and courteous. I'd go to Sandbar again because I enjoyed the drinks and had fun there."}
{"text":"RUDE DJ!!!!  I went to Sandbar for a Birthday party to enjoy drinks and dancing. The Birthday girl asked for a particular song to play for her Birthday. I went up to the DJ to let him know we wanted to hear it for the Birthday girl. Due to us reserving a cabana and spending  a great deal of money there we should be able to hear ONE song! He said he would play it later and said we should never should talk to a DJ like that.  Which I wasn't sure what he was talking about due to my respectful request to him. I let him know at that time we would be leaving shortly and he didn't care and brushed us off. Isn't the DJ there as customer service, to serve the bar customers music and play what they want to hear??? Obviously not at Sandbar, he was extremely rude and gave us a sour end to the evening. That DJ needs to get off his high horse, will not be going back!!!!!! Isn't there enough DJ's in the Chandler area for Sandbar to get one with a smile??"}
{"text":"This place would be better if the dj played more than 30 seconds of each song. Watch the crowd dj! Sand bar-get a new dj and you will have better weekend profits!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, food, atmosphere.  Anna helped us out today.  She was very friendly and suggested some great meals for us.  She recommended the chicken fajitas for me that was perfect!  My friends really enjoyed their meals and drinks.  She constantly checked on us with a friendly smile.  I guess I was even happier that a friend picked up my meal!  ;-).  I would highly recommend this place!  Ask for Anna!!"}
{"text":"Not so great service. RESEATED twice without consideration to inconvenience. Moved out into the cold like cattle with drunks breaking glasses and throwing chicken wings. Highly doubt there will be a second visit."}
{"text":"come for drinks only food is pathetic ,feels like they have microwaved frozen chicken n served"}
{"text":"Meant to do this a while ago, but forgot.  Went with family of 4. Not young kids, but teenagers.  Food was ok, but it took us a long time to get seated and it's just WAY TOO LOUD!  We joked the entire time, how this place is like a \"meat market!\"  Definitely NOT a family place to dine.  The entertainment was watching people get \"hit on!\"  Not my cup of tea but I suppose, if I were younger and single, it might be a fun place.  Just not for a family, at all!"}
{"text":"We come here for football Sunday's and they do have a lot of tv's. However, they don't make use of them as 1 game will be on 5 tv's. Would be nice to see all the games that are on."}
{"text":"Very good sports bar with an indoor - outdoor feel. Try the mini chimis. Staff is friendly and location is just off 101."}
{"text":"Really great food and such a fun environment. A little bit on the expensive side, but the happy hour is pretty good."}
{"text":"What's so awesome about this place is besides the fact that the drink variety is vast and the bartenders know what they're doing, the food hits the spot. Tasty, salsa is on point, and it's good any day of the week."}
{"text":"We met up here on a Saturday for a work group happy hour. Seems like a fun atmosphere with surf board tables and beach sand patio and cabanas.  The food however wasn't good. I was going to get the batter cheese curds but the other lady said she had them and they weren't good. She felt like they were bottom of the barrel curds, so we tried the bbq chicken sliders. I was expecting the chicken to be tender and shredded, it wasn't either. It was gross. And the other ladies food came with a curly hair!! My drink \"liquid Marijuana\" was watered down, you can taste mostly pineapple juice and it was light green. Should have been a darker green and not watered down.  I wouldn't waste my time going here again unless I had to."}
{"text":"Tacky, low quality. Loud, smells like BO, vomit and alcohol. In other words like a typical Florida beachside dive. If that's the ambiance they aimed for them they nailed it. Food was bleh."}
{"text":"Nice vibes and music and drinks but the food was okay. Would come back for the drinks and ambience."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Especially on a cabana. Once you hit the amount you have to spend ($300 minimum) they kick you out. It was our friends birthday and we planned on celebrating all night but instead service was horrible and we were asked to leave once we spent $300. When asked for a detailed transaction receipt, our server said \"Seriously?\". I will never go back and I'll make sure my friends never go there. I didn't even want to give them a star rating. Hate this place."}
{"text":"The food here is blah. I'd rather eat tacos from a dozen places I pass on the way here... The bar atmosphere is crowded on weekends... standing room only in fact. Drinks are okay, lots of TVs to go with the fake beachy vibe. The music was not my groove but did observe some hilarious drunk dancing that was the most entertainment to be had... If I am invited to yet another birthday bash here, I may or may not decide to come."}
{"text":"It was our first time at sandbar, me and a friend got the jalepeno mac n cheese. And my boyfriend got the calamari. The jalepeno mac was missing the cheese and jalepeno...it was tateless. And my bf had a hair in his calamari! The waitress we had seemed to have an attitude, and when I told her it was our first time here she didn't even explain the menu. I don't think she even introduced herself. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the manager was very sweet and gave my bf a new plate of calamari and took it off our bill. She was very apologetic! Other than that, my experience was not great and I would rate it less."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a late night drink, it seemed like a chill place. The guy at the door seemed annoyed, maybe because the girl 'called' us walking in and the guy had to check our IDs (we are 21+) he seemed annoyed, but to an extent I get it. Once we sat down at the bar is where I really didn't get any customer service. The woman seem to be annoyed she had to make a simple mixed drink and a beer. She was ready to go but not as much as I was I guess! Honestly it was a weird experience, maybe because I am not use such horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Food, not so good. Service, so so. Don't waste your time. Not really much more to say, but Yelp insists I fluff up my review so I will add that I will never ever eat at this establishment again."}
{"text":"Went to Sandbar on Sat. specifically because their website advertised happy hour from noon - 7:00pm.  When we asked our waitress about it she indicated the Sat. happy hour had been discontinued since Aug.  After 4 months they should have been able to update their website.  At this point it is becoming a case of false advertising!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Service and food were great.  Other yelpers are clueless.  James the bartender is the man - made it worth the stop."}
{"text":"Good service, nice servers. Happy hour deals are great for a light meal or beer with a buddy. Nachos add grilled steak for $10 total was a winner! Cold beer on special with great choices."}
{"text":"Went here for Cinco de Mayo @7pm for dinner and it was a $20 cover per person.  What a joke.  Only a moron would pay that for a mediocre bar in  the middle of the city, and then pay $6 for a beer.  This place gets pretty dark and the food isn't good."}
{"text":"I went to the Sandbar today for the first time for lunch and we had a great time. Kelly was our server and she was super nice and made sure that we had everything we needed. If you're looking for a place to go out with friends and get some good food and atmosphere, definitely check out Sandbar."}
{"text":"Two star only because my waitress wasn't a b and the cheese dip was good.   This place is like walking into a frat house. The seats felt rather sticky, pretty gross. And since it was dark at night, you don't know what the heck are on those leather. Service was super slow. The waitresses definitely has something to \"showcase.\" My guy friends were definitely starring lmao!   I came here for a friend's bday. The outside patio was packed. Inside was loud, but they played great music. The food, besides the cheese dip is nothing to be raving about. My tamale was dry and overcooked. Either that or it was frozen o.o Guacamole was alright. Salsa was good. Basically foods were meh. Drinks were good though. I don't think I'd come back unless it's for a friend or something. Definitely not my type of scene xD"}
{"text":"I don't like big crowds, so I go to this place off hours for the food. I have been there three times, and had take out once. I enjoyed the food and never had any problems with the service.  Love their nachos and fish tacos.  I see lots of younger reviewers liking the crowds, music, and happy hour fun, but the food is good too! Of course, the service is going to be slower when the place is jammed.  We attempted to go on a Friday and it was too crowded, so chose another restaurant.  But, we still will go when we don't see the crowds, for their good food."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sandbar for just a little over a year now and I really like the place.  Inside they have a small dance floor that getsta poppin' around 11pm.  Sandbar has themes every once in a while and that's kind of fun.  Live music and lots of outside space.  Just remember to ditch the high heels if you plan on spending any time outside; it's all sand.  They have some cabana's you can reserve outside too.  It will fit around 5 people comfortably, although we have had around 10 in them. Service from the waitress is good most of the time too.  If you get there before the kitchen closes, they have some pretty decent food.  The people that show up at Sandbar are so different, you could not say this is a specific type of person bar.  Young, middle aged, older...hip hop, country, urban...a little of everyone is there and makes for a great crowd.  This is a pretty casual atmosphere, jeans and a cute top for the ladies and jeans and a nice tee for the men."}
{"text":"It is hard to figure this place out. I went on a Friday night around 930PM for dinner. We were seated right away yet the employees are very independent acting, not bad but for sure not the friendliest. The place was busy and the ambience was nice. We each ordered a skinny margarita on the rocks. What an amazing rip off! It is 9.00 for the drink and it gave not the slightest of a buzz. 9.00 for a small margarita with no buzz effect. The food was good and not terribly expensive, average for a trendy Mexican restaurant. No chips and salsa unless you request it. The waiter was okay but he would disappear for long periods. At 10:00PM, the place becomes horribly loud as they play music videos on the TV's all over the place--so loud that you can forget about talking to your party. The place is kind of wanna be'ish as people come there to be seen. Why they would fight crowds and loud noise for over priced and weak drinks is beyond me. I think it would be a nice place during the week during happy hour but not so great when packed. They say they have this dress code yet I saw plenty with hats, flip flops, and athletic clothes. It is cool they have TV's all over so you can watch your team play but at 10:00, it all goes away for the music (except a few TV's at the bar)--"}
{"text":"I've come to this Sandbar a few times now and I've really had a great time. The Happy Hour is everyday, which is awesome, and there guacamole is amazing! Its a fun atmosphere on the weekends if you wanna dance with your girlfriends, but I've also come for lunch when its nice to relax on the sand and catchup with your co-workers. The waitstaff has always been on point and friendly =)"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and both were terrible experiences. I would not recommend going there for the nightlife, drinks are over priced and they kicked my friend out for literally no reason at all.  We were sitting at a table with 4 other friends conversing and security just randomly came up to my buddy and said \"you need to leave right now you are too intoxicated.\" He didn't even get to finish his second drink. I think it was because we were taking up a table and not spending a lot of money on drinks or food right away. Not quite sure. When I respectfully asked the security what happened and what my friend did to get kicked out he was disrespectful and brushed me off like he was too cool. He just said \"intoxicated\" and walked away. We went over to City North after and had no problems the rest of the night.   I will NEVER come back to Sandbar. After reading other reviews it looks like I'm not the only one who has had this problem."}
{"text":"Y'know, it's Desert Ridge.  I wasn't expecting much, and it delievered.  I hadn't been here yet, it was just after work, I thought I'd try it.  Positive was Nick, my Waiter, VERY cute, friendly, flirty and efficient.  BUT the negatives?  Food blah.  NO CHIPS OR SALSA with the meal.  Decent margarita, but in the WRONG glass.  And super scuzzy clientele -- there is such a thing as TOO casual.  I hope Nick gets a better restaurant gig, he deserves more than this.  This is really a tattoo parlor masquerading as an upscale North Scottsdale cantina.  Nick, go apply at a Scottsdale Quarter restaurant, that's more worthy of your abilities."}
{"text":"Having driven by numerous times when it was totally packed, I decided to try Sandbar in North Phoenix.  On a Monday night it wasn't that crowded.  Their Happy Hour deals are pretty good...half off on all appetizers.  The peel-and-eat shrimp was only o.k., but the carne asada nachos were really good.  Beers on tap -- no Negra Modelo, but they do have Alaskan Amber and Blue Moon -- are $3 during HH.  The bartender was annoyingly friendly (\"Hi I'm Alan\" while reaching out to shake my hand), but the service was responsive.  I expected the worst and this was definitely better than that.  I didn't see the douche factor I expected, but I'm holding out judgement until I show up on a night where it's standing room only."}
{"text":"Sunday- Sept. 9th.  Excellent DJ.  -The best part of the experience.  Excellent server with a bright smile.   Downside- food was weak at best.  Wings were terribly tiny and for 12 bucks, a total waste of money.   The wings were smaller than a sugar packet.  See the picture I posted.  They should be embarrassed to serve those things."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a spicy margarita! Make sure you ask for Matt the bartender to make his specialty drink (spicy Margarita). By far the best margarita I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This place would not leave us alone about being Christian !!! They had bouncers rotate to tell us we had to leave about our small gold small chain cross on our neck . I been a paid advertiser of yelp for years for my company iv never seen this before. This is racist and horrible treatment for freedom of wearing a cross at a time like this"}
{"text":"Looked like a good place for drinks. The food and service was mediocre."}
{"text":"My friend and I were becoming regular customers until last night.  Lots of drama, between the servers not communicating with each other and throwing away our food and another customer who was super drunk and yelling at me. A terrible experience overall that ended in an unfair expulsion of me, but not her."}
{"text":"We had brunch here and the food was amazing. I had the huevos rancheros which was fresh and delicious. It has a really fun atmosphere also."}
{"text":"This place is sad. Visited for the first time last night after seeing it for a few years, got there at 10pm, sat down at the bar and didn't even get asked if we wanted drinks after the bartender passed us by 6 times, it wasn't that busy... We all know what busy and short staff is...and there was no way she should of been overwhelmed to serve us or even greet us. We actually had to wave her down the second time for drinks. That should of been the second red flag. We asked to order food and she didn't know if they served food after 10pm...and I asked if she could THEN ASK someone else that works there (DUHHH!!!). I get if you're new, but again, no way she was new, she knew where everything was, she just didn't care to serve us. We got out food after waiting 30 minutes for 1 order of 3 tacos... Very dry and no taste, no salsa, not anything. When the man server came, we asked him to tell our server to close the check and he looked at us mad and said, \"NO\"! squinted his eyes like we were idiots, and walked away. I thought, ooppps maybe he's super busy and needs to go back to the kitchen...NOPE! after he left us he actually went behind the bar and was standing right next to our bartender not doing much but talking...after a few minutes later I have to stand up so she can acknowledge me, and she didn't, had to walk around the whole bar to grab her and literally wave my two hands down so she can look up and say, \"OH, yes????\" CHECK PLEASE! we sat back down, to try to finish our tacos.....and a different waiter comes up with a rude face and says, \"are you done???\" I smiled and said no not yet, as I had a taco in my hand eating it. He looked upset with this face ,almost like the other man waitress, ( ANNOYED LOOK) young kid, so rude, came back twice to interrupt us in less than 5 minutes,  I think just to purposely to be rude. I don't know why we even stayed that long, maybe wishing it would turn out better after every minute. It actually just got worse. SAD PLACE! Why is it still open when there are so many bad reviews? OH..ps....the bartender didn't know what Blue Label was...Interesting."}
{"text":"I went in to Sandbar last week and really enjoyed my experience. I went in for Happy Hour and they have great specials from 3-7. Their house margarita is my favorite around and is only 4$ on the HH menu. They also have really great appetizers and small bites for only 6$ on their HH menu. My favorite thing to eat from this is their nachos. Be prepared though, they are HUGE and plenty to share. The ambience during this time of day is really relaxing. They have great music playing and sitting on the patio is a great way to unwind for the day. Even though its hot outside, the misters, shades, and covers keep it very comfortable on the patio."}
{"text":"Bad service, non family oriented, young ladies pimped out and dress like they are ready to ride the pole or hunting for horney guys with money.   Managers on site, useless, unfriendly and definitely unprofessional.  If you like the atmosphere I described.   You'll love it here.  Yeah right."}
{"text":"Strong pours and decent food. It gets busy, as it is a hot-spot meat -market. Don't expect much, try to have fun. You will have a good time at Sand Bar if you aren't an entitled baby. Be patient, the place is busy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have so much fun every time I go to The Sandbar. They have some of the best events held here. This Halloween they had a costume contest and games where you can win prizes, and they even had turkey bowling around Thanksgiving last year. Also during the holidays they make some of the best drinks that go with that specific holiday theme,  they are so delicious! The food here is also very good, I really enjoy getting their tacos here, they taste absolutely fantastic! The service is really great, everyone seems really friendly and very quick to serve. Kelli, one of the managers that work there is super cool. She is so friendly and helpful, and is a mega hottie! If you are looking for a place with a fun atmosphere, and to get awesome drinks and food, The Sandbar is the place to be! Also they even have a short bus that takes people to and from Cardinal games! How awesome is that!"}
{"text":"Really great place for people of any age group! I do like the music played here and it is near to a variety of restaurants. So grab some buds, get some food and then head to the sandbar to grab a drink, dance, and act the fool :) Drinks are pretty affordable although, I seemed to manage to get others to pay for my drinks. I may have talked to a few guys but, at the end of the night it's not really a place that you will meet the man of your dreams. More likely to meet students and people out to have fun."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  We ordered drinks three times with the same waitress and didn't receive one."}
{"text":"The two and half stars that this place has is pretty much dead on. It has a lot going for it but it falls short in several areas.   The place was excessively loud & the acoustics where we were sitting seemed to magnify the loud groups all around us.  We had specifically requested that our daughter's dinner be brought out first as it takes her longer to eat her meal; it was the last to arrive.  The guacamole was really good but the chips were not. They seemed slightly thicker & airy. The wife loved her chimichanga.  The steak burrito I ordered would have been better had they got it from Taco Bell instead of the kitchen. It had very little meat & was folded in such a way that the majority of the bulk of the burrito was from the folded tortilla. I didn't want the rice & asked that it be left off but it was on my plate when it arrived.  Our waitress was nice & helpful in pointing out the specials. But she didn't bring out our food & we had to wait several minutes after our food arrived to get silverware to eat with"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is still in business. If you're going to do Mexican food around here, you got to least do it right. I had frozen burritos from Walmart that tasted better; and that's pretty sad. Top it off they treat their customers like crap. Word of advice, if people are spending ridiculous amount of Money in your place at least show some gratitude."}
{"text":"Saturday night at Sandbar was an interesting experience.  I'm not sure I've ever seen so many people who looked alike in one place.  Ok, maybe I have.  I have been to Axis & Radius.   This place was wall to wall people.  There was an overabundance of girls with the same \"edgy\" hair cuts/colors, who looked like they had the same tattoo artist.  That comment actually holds true for the guys as well.  I lost count of how many Ramones t-shirts I saw, and then there were the \"Keep calm and carry on\" t-shirts some guys were sporting.  I see that saying on mugs a lot, so I was entertained that it was the shirt of choice for picking up chicks on a Saturday night, and was left wondering if these guys even knew the origin of that saying.    Like so many others places, the bouncers seemed to be the hottest guys there.  I can honestly say this place is not my scene.  It almost made me miss the Sandbar in Scottsdale.  I never really liked that place, but I did have some hilariously good times there."}
{"text":"Unfriendly bar/bouncer staff, overpriced drinks, mediocre atmosphere. I've been to sandbar Tatum on a couple of occasions before and had a good time. Tonight I had one of the worst customer service experience at this place . It was a kick back night for me and my roommates. Our 1st round of drinks consisted of one bartender asking repetitive idiotic questions about our drink order.Although baffled by her stupidity, I continued to be polite. The 2nd round consisted of pricey and  watered down don Julio shots in which the bartender claimed the shots were bigger than we thought because the glasses were \"big\". Trust when I say these were shots were watered down. This is not my first Rodeo folks. the next round consisted of the same round of shots for even more $ with no rhyme or reason. My roommates brushed it off.   Shortly after, a bouncer proclaimed that he needed to see my ID for a 2nd time. And after asking him what the purpose was, he responded with \"there's a state law that requires you to furnish your idea when asked\". After I asked him exactly which law he is referring to and to see if he could show me HIS id, his response was \"I don't know which law but it's a statute and now you have to go. \" - dumbass. The manager who we spoke with ending up being douchier than the rest and was very unhelpful.  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. It doesn't take a lawyer to recognize when someone is a liar with no ambition and nothing better to do with their sorry, unfulfilled, and meaningless lives. Sandbar, I learned, is not the place for me and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I have better things to do and will not ever visit this horrid place again."}
{"text":"Came in today during happy hour and had a really good experience. This place runs so efficiently! I was with my sister and our drinks and food came out promptly. Our server was also very attentive...and I'm all about service! The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is that the food we decided to other was just okay. Not bad, but not great! I would definitely come back here though!"}
{"text":"Met some friends there over the weekend.  Very crowded but that's ok cause we were there to have fun and people watch.  Beachy kind of atmosphere - a little corny but hey, this is a fun place so I don't take it too seriously.  Margaritas were good.  Bartender was hot.  Food was ok, but hey it's bar food so I didn't expect great.  Good place to hang out and drink."}
{"text":"The Sandbar is a place to pick up or to be picked up; I went there for a goodbye party for a coworker. We had 6 in our booth, all ordering different drinks and food. The appetizers are pretty good, the nachos are a little better than most, the fried clams are very good (tender not chewy) and there is a great Thai chili dipping sauce.   They have a heavy pour on their drinks which is great when you're drinking Knob Creek, however they need a little work on their mix drinks the Mojitos were just bad.   We went 01/25/13 and Kyle was our server. He was very nice at the end of the night to help sort out everyone bill. This rating should be a 3.5 but I round up."}
{"text":"I just cant get enough of this place!!!! they seriously are thee only place to get happy hour!!! $3 dos xx ?! where are you getting cheaper beer in as nice of a place? also great food too on happy hour!!"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are great I hate them two days in a row since I am not out here much."}
{"text":"Meh. Food is ok for the price. Drinks aren't especially cheap, but gets 4 stars for a good atmosphere and generally prompt service."}
{"text":"Checked out this place on the way through and really enjoyed it.  I love Mexican food and Sandbar did not disappoint.  The menu is extensive and very reasonably priced.   There's plenty of opportunities to watch sports and get a drink.  All in all a great experience with good food, attentive service and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here during st patty's day! It was awesome good service, make sure to bring your swim suit, the pool was amazing and the water was warm."}
{"text":"I'm honestly shocked that the reviews on this place are so bad! My husband and I have been coming here every other Wednesday for \"date night\" for the last 2 years and we love it! It's a great, super casual place with good drink specials, and you can't beat the large outdoor patio. This isn't some fancy 5 star restaurant so if that is what you are looking for, this definitely isn't the place for you. The food is good, I wouldn't say outstanding, but good. This place is ALWAYS packed and if you come at 9PM or later on a Friday night, it is definitely a club like scene which isn't really my thing so we usually stick to lunch on the weekends or an occasional happy hour during the week. If you're looking for a place to just hang out with friends, drink and watch some football, you will love it here. They have a different special every day, for example, Wednesdays are 1/2 price craft beers and they have a live band playing at night. For only having a 2 star rating, this place sure isn't hurting for business! :)"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas -- enjoyed Taco Tuesday - worth the trip."}
{"text":"Second trip to the Sandbar today and it was exactly like the first - Meh.  I will say, the chips and salsa are excellent.  A nice spicy red salsa and a nice spicy green that looks more like a pesto.  First time I tried the veggie fajitas - just ok, the tortillas were a little old, veggie mix was different kinds of peppers and onion ( I ordered it without mushrooms) not a lot of flavor and, FYI their fajitas do not come with rice & beans.  Second time I had the cheese quesadillas, too greasy and heavy but the taste was ok.  I went with a group of 9 and no one was impressed by their dish.   Servers are cute but service isn't very good.  Cool setup with sand and a big bar that opens to the patio.  If you went there for couple of beers and some chips and salsa you would probably enjoy yourself.   If you looking for good Mexican food and/or good service - keep driving."}
{"text":"Really fun and friendly atmosphere. Tables outside and in the sand, good for times when I miss Malibu. Lots of TV's for the sport fans. Prices are reasonable and food is typical and ok."}
{"text":"Cool locals spot. The food is delicious. They have tons of tvs to watch sports.  If you go at night they have great music. The bar is very fast and don't have to wait long for a drink. There are also girls walking around selling shots. I have been to one of their 5 de mayo events and had a blast. This bar puts up a great party."}
{"text":"When they call this place the sandbar, they're not kidding! It's a bar surrounded by beach style benches and the floor is covered in sand! Unknowingly, we came on Songo night which was awesome! While we dined on our coconut shrimps and shrimp tacos, we played our hand at musical bingo. Although none of us won, it was a blast putting our musical knowledge to the test!  It was a fun atmosphere and we had such a great time, for sure I'd recommend anyone to check out Sandbar, especially on Songo night!"}
{"text":"They are supposed to have happy hour Saturday from 11-7. We went at 3:00 and were told they were not having happy hour because of the fight. The fight didn't start until 6. Why would you cancel HH all day?  Even though college football was on, most of the TVs were showing the prior days NFL preseason games or infomercials. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We just came from Sandbar.  First of all, they do not serve chips and salsa as every other Mexican restaurant does.  How do they get by with that ?  Their service was poor at best and their meals are rather pricey.  We had 2 chicken fajitas meals for $14 each, which sounds okay, but you get 3 very thin tortillas, a thumb's worth of guacamole, 4 thin strips of grilled chicken and a small amout of fried veggies.  While the food tasted ok, we both left the restaurant a little hungry.  I have never left a mexican restuarant hungry, until Sandbar served me.  $ 28 for food  $12 for 2 beers.  After tax and tip, we ended up paying near $50 for lunch. Sandbar got me today, but Sandbar won't see us ever again and we live so close we walked there.  Boo, Sandbar !"}
{"text":"I went here with my fiancée and a group of friends on Saturday night. We were looking for some nightlife and sand bar absolutely qualified. Loud music, dancing, a building packed with bodies and a late night taco station. The sand bar, beach theme was cool. I was actually suprised it seemed like a place that could be good during the day time as well. Not a bad choice for that side of town.  Did I mention taco cart? Who doesn't like drunk-tacos??"}
{"text":"This place tried to kick out my 22 year old friend for being underage. They then said not to ask for a free drink when I said to compensate him for the rude gesture. Later they brought us some cheap house shots. Too late."}
{"text":"It was sad ,  the server was the slow  , she so busy talking to the bartenders that she forgot us.  She finally remember us to take our order. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 to get our food.We finally got our food. The tacos are just o.k.  nothing big at all. The salsa was blah . I just couldn't believe why they call mexican grill because it wasn't not here. I was not impress at on."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the first was better. Atmosphere is awesome, patio is great and music is rockin. Almost a casual club like environment if you go at night on the weekends. The service is not bad (sitting at the bar) and the food is great as long as you stick with Mexican dishes. I had the BBQ Pork sandwich and was disappointed, not horrible just not great. Decent beer selection and acceptable price.  If you keep your expectations realistic, this place can live up to them!"}
{"text":"Very bad service, probably was sitting here for 20min in the booth. I ask the bartenders to see if we can get service but no go. Idk how this place works but now I can see why the bad reviews. Terrible"}
{"text":"I have only been for lunch so i can only comment on the restaurant and not the bar (or bar ambience) but i am impressed with the quality of the food. It is most definitely American/Mex but the fish and carnitas tacos are quite tasty."}
{"text":"I love this bar.  The GM, Adam, has to be the hardest working guy in the business.  The entire staff is cheerful and attentive; the tacos are slammin.  I come out to the area on business from New England several times a year and this place is my go to any time of day - it's very relaxed; one of the few places where it feels like they actually want be to hang out and enjoy a drink.  When they're considering a new craft beer or tweaking a cocktail recipe, they never hesitate to offer me the opportunity to taste and weigh in.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was AWESOME! Drinks were strong and very delicious! My server Jake was super attentive and entertaining! Enjoyed the food as well ! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The SandBar was a disappointment. The was not good - the bucket of chips they served me had something dripped on the bottom half, so half of the chips were soggy. The lettuce in the salad was wilted. I had a vodka tonic, but the carbonation/liquid ratio was off because there weren't any bubbles.  I went on a Friday at lunch, there were plenty of seats and the servers were attentive and friendly. There are huge indoor and outdoor seating areas. They have tons of TV's visible at the bar and all around. They mark the TV's ahead of time, so you know where your team will be playing. They played country music loudly outside and had cabana's to rent, which looked cool. If you are there for beer and fun, this might be a good choice. Skip the bottle drinks and food."}
{"text":"So I have driven by this place many times and it always looks packed so I thought I would give it a try. Sat out in the patio where they had misters and good music but that was the best part of my whole experience. I ordered combo tacos which were all cold and lacked flavor. The waitress rarely came to our table and the iced tea was watered down. I will definitely never return to this place."}
{"text":"If you enjoy watching your bartenders and waitresses hang on each other in sexual ways, you'll love this place. The waiters/waitresses/bartenders all look like they are out of southbeach. Lots of big fake boobs on several of the young girls. One in particular was having a great time bouncing hers back and forth in front of the other male bartenders. She also had lots of peircings. The topper was when this female bartender got behind one of the male bartenders that was washing glasses and pushed on his butt with her crotch from behind. This all took place on 7/6/11 around 6:30. We had a straight shot down the bar at this little act. They were also taking pictures of each other behind the bar in between waiting on customers. Not all of the waitresses, etc. were this classless or over sexed. Some of them were normal.  The food was pretty good. We had the nachos with additional chicken and guacamole'. Our bartender was very nice. I might go back. Not sure at this point.  Bottom line is that I feel that this was inappropriate behavior while you are working."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday. Order Nachos for an appetizer and they were \"banging.\" Also, order tacos for my entree and they were pretty good as well. Like the set up and the staff seemed friendly."}
{"text":"Today I had jicama shrimp tacos with beans and rice guacamole and chips food was good and the service was great all good"}
{"text":"There are few places I love to go to more than twice a month.  Sandbar is the best, I love the service and the food is quick and delicious.  I suggest getting their guacamole. Also, the baja tacos have this delicious sauce.  It is AMAZE BALLS!  Drink wise - their cadillac margerita is strong and delicious.  For dinner and drinks its great, especially taco tuesday ($2 tacos)!   At night it comes alive and is always a good time.  The bartends pour heavy and they are really quick with how few there are and how many people are always there!  I have never had a bad night or meal at Sandbar!"}
{"text":"Cant wear gym shorts to this place on weekends but the bouncer has a dip in and its not considered grimy.  The logic behind this establishment makes me want to smash my face in"}
{"text":"If you give your credit card please know that they put a hold on it for $50.00. Unfortunately even though I did not want to give the card but was forced to because I felt that there was no other option beside leaving I took it. To make a long story short, I paid my bill cash and a half hour later looked at my credit card account and they ran it for the amount I already paid. Tried to talk to the GM steve and yes I was upset because I like the place, but hate a hustle, smoking mirrors, what ever you call it this day.  We talked and he said he would take care if it in the morning, the problem is that they think it is okay to hold your card for $50 with out getting any authorization or billing it after you paid in cash! Why is it okay for this to happen? As far as I have always know, an establishment can never put a hold on a card with authorization( signature) and then when you call and are upset( which Is a common response) they act like it is you fault. Great place when it comes to the bill, watch your money( or should I say unauthorized holds on your credit cards that they ask for)"}
{"text":"Crazy packed. It is the hip and cool bar right now... Drink prices are ok."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, but the bathrooms were disgusting dirty.  Service is very very slow. Changed servers twice during our visit. Neither better than the last. We order a queso dip that never showed. One of our groups mimosa set at the bar while we watched for 15 mins. Love all the tv's. Serves has just gone downhill in the few years we've been coming."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in and there were about 5 people that came and went from the reception area and we were never acknowledged until they decided to seat us.  So started out not so good.  It got much better though.   Our waitress Jennifer was awesome!  She was very sweet and checked on my husband and I often.  We decided to watch boxing fight and she still came by often to see if we needed more drinks or anything, even if they were full.  Super sweet and I would request her if I came back.  We r from out of town, but will definitley request her next time in town.  Thanks so much Jennifer!!"}
{"text":"I get this place isn't gourmet and the food can be.... Whatever, but my fiancé and I had really good service there not too long ago during happy hour (and it was busy). I'm obsessed with bean dip and it was good, I got chicken tacos and although kinda bland, I was satisfied. We had the petite blonde with long hair. She always made sure our drinks were filled, food came out on time, check in a timely manner, she was friendly and really cute. She took pictures with little 12 year old boys who thought she was a hottie even though she was busy! I haven't been here past like 9pm in years though, so can't speak on that"}
{"text":"Service was very good and friendly! We went in just for drinks on the patio so I can't comment on the food. Drink prices were a little high but the environment was worth it."}
{"text":"Always a good time. I love the atmosphere, and it's one of my favorite spots to frequent. I moved to AZ last year, and it has become a tradition go to Sandbar with new friends! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good appetizers & great happy hour prices! We had the mini chimis and cheese quesadilas. We went there not too hungry, on a Sat afternoon. Was a bit taken aback to see young waitresses that looked like minors, showing way too much cleavage. i am sure they are not minors. Felt like telling them to go home & wear a real shirt :) Anyway, I guess that is the vibe they are going for. Did not seem like a lewd place though and there weren't any misbehaved drunks or anything. But it was noon."}
{"text":"Anyone that tells you they have fast service and great drinks is a liar. I have been forced for years to meet at the Sandbar before going on bike rides or a central point for everyone to meet before we all go out. Bartenders...suck, slow and pour weak drinks...make that expensive weak drinks. The servers missing in action, screw up orders constantly and lack any kind of customer service. The only reason this place is still around (unlike the others that failed miserably) is because its the only freaking place in North Phx to go. I pray for another place to open soon to put these guys out of business."}
{"text":"Sandbar is a mediocre place we tried out because it's close to home and we love Mexican.  I feel sandbar is kind of a shame to Mexican food though.  The food was just not good.  The margaritas were cheap and pretty strong.  The environment was kind of odd with two parallel bars.  In the end, I just think there are better places to visit."}
{"text":"If you're still in training Pant's/Bra, then you may like this place. If you're an adult, don't waste your time. Or you're Cash. The food was so bad they had to re do it twice. And they still couldn't get it right. The drinks were watered down as well. Horrible... Just Horrible."}
{"text":"Went to Sandbar in Chandler for taco Tuesday last night,  The inside temperature of the restaurant was probably in the mid 80s to low 90s, the manager said the air conditioning system cannot keep up it was very hot.  Would not recommend this place in the summer. Air-conditioning problems  won't go back until they solve their problems.  6-20-17"}
{"text":"Sandbar is a great place to hangout without having to deal with the hassle of \"going out\". I've been here for Taco Tuesdays three times, a Saturday night with a friend, and on a date. I've been satisfied every time. The food is good. All my servers have been friendly. Especially the woman who picks up the plates, if she recognizes you she gives you a warm hug and makes quick small talk in english and spanish.   I was surprised to hear a good DJ. I moved here in September of 2014 from Miami and I've been disappointed at the quality of DJs. However on Tuesday nights the DJ mixes 90s hits with modern house beats. Heard some really good remixes. Saturdays is top 40s with the occasional trap remix. I was surprised they even threw in a merengue for the latin crowd. Given that there's a good sized dance floor I wished the DJ would have focused more on keeping that vibe going more. I feel he played more to the non-dancers which makes sense because they make the bar money. Could be a great dance spot if music was a little better.  Crowd is ok, not upscale, chill mixed crowd. Expect a few cat calls on a weekend from men as you walk through the crowd. Can be annoying but tolerable.   The overall vibe is pretty laid back, ladies you can dress down or rock heals on a weekend and not feel over dressed. Keep in mind some of the outdoor seating in on sand when picking the right shoes.  I don't drink so I can't comment on that, but they do make a yummy virgin pina colada and shirley temple, yes I actually ordered those. You should have seen their faces.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service from Amber! Good food, great margaritas, lovely evening in their open air dining area."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place & been told they line up to get in (don't know why). Checked it out today for a Margarita (had better Koolaid many years ago). Gave the bartender a $5 bill to pay for a $4 Margarita & never saw her again with my change. Her loss since I normally tip $2 per drink. Maybe food is good, but won't go back to try it."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and YELP is always out fist go to- I think they called the ratings wrong on this one.  The waitstaff is superb, beer is COLD (always a plus in my book) great parking, super price point and the food is really good.   Jalepeno cheese curds were not greasy and just enough of a bite to keep you wanting more.  We ordered Ahi Tuna tacos and chicken enchiladas.  Ahi tacos are fresh, perfectly seats with some heat- they are on jicama tacos- adds a fresh taste a little hard to handle but delicious.  Chicken enchiladas are not greasy, good spice perfect amount of sauce, cheese and chicken.  We will be back before we leave Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"came during taco tuesday! there was a nice size crowd and awesome DJ playing music all night. the food wasn't too bad and the alcohol was made evenly. i ordered the fish tacos, not the best in town but i had no complaints. i didn't have to wait too long for the bartender which was great.   overall experience was pretty decent but nothing really impressed me."}
{"text":"Love this place, not only do I love their mexican mule but this place has a class act. Alisha, Nick, Marlee, and Million at the bar are the most courteous friendly group of mixologists in Phoenix. This place is Hands down my favorite spot to sit outside and watch college and pro football."}
{"text":"Our server Andrew was the best! With a group of 20 he got every single persons order correct (which is extremely difficult).  It was our first time here and he gave us a reason to come back! Keep up the great work. I think we got lucky with Andrew, but we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Just went in for a drink and some appetizers. We tried the queso, which had mushrooms in it which was unique.  It came with the chips and chipotle and green salsas. The frozen margaritas were good (prickly pear was a bit sweet).   Worst part: The PokeStop isn't in reach from the indoor bar. It's apparently at the tiki at the entrance, and it really sucks that it is out of range. Oh well.  The Sandbar is decent. It'll be even better starting football season. Next time I'll try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a fun bar to go to! Sandbar is another one of the few places where if I designed a Mexican themed bar, it would look exactly like this. Setup of the dance floor, open air themed, huge outdoor patio and the guy cooking the fresh carne on the side.   There is tons and tons of bar space around here so it's fairly easy to grab a drink, plus waitresses are always walking around trying to get people to do a crazy shot.   The last time we went I was able to tweet the DJ and all the recent tweets shows up on all the TVs around the bar so I could see my drunken shout outs to my girl. The DJ ended up following me on Twitter after that night and even tweeted me asking about a place I checked into on Yelp the following week, so bonus points for having an interactive DJ.  There are not a lot of other options on this side of town. The last night we went here we were bouncing around the SE Valley then after Sandbar we drove to Mill. Though Sandbar is perfectly fine for closing the bar down, just get in line a little early for those yummy street tacos because a drunk hungry crowd will ensure you never get one for yourself!   Protip: Get in line before closing time for those tacos. You'll want one after smelling them all night!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Finally take a break to go to lunch for Mother's Day and just horrible. One server that I could see for like 40 tables. Waitress said there was 2 which is still not enough !! They need to learn to accommodate people that don't eat meat or cheese. I asked for nachos with black beans and extra guacamole instead of cheese and sour cream. I got chips with a few jalapeños sprinkled on top a few tomatoes and scoop of salsa on the side and a teaspoon of guac. I sent it back once again asking for black beans and extra guac. Explained it was a plate of chips. It came back with refried, not black, beans slopped on top. No extra guac. Looked so bad almost seemed intentional so I was afraid to order anything else. Could not get waiter so grabbed a very sweet cocktail waitress, Michelle. She tried to help but lunch was already ruined. No manager to be seen to try to smooth it over. Literally like flushing money down the toilet. All I have to say is go somewhere else. What a joke. Oh and we had to go get our check after  waiting 20 minutes. Whole bill should have been comped. Owners or corporate should be ashamed. Wish I had read the other reviews first. 0 stars."}
{"text":"I came for lunch last week and they have really good specials, not too crowded and good service.  Great place for taco Tuesday or happy hour pretty much any day. Casual chill yet fun vibe early but come a little later for more of a party vibe. Its worth checkin out if your in the area and remember... Tequila makes her clothes fall off."}
{"text":"Came out here on a Saturday afternoon to grab some drinks. When we walked in, the place was packed with Iowa fans. Didn't expect Arizona to have such a huge Iowa following so I kinda chuckled. It was a good atmosphere though, a sea of black and yellow with everyone having a good time.   We sat inside because the outside was packed. Ended up ordering the Mini Chimis along with some Crown and Cokes. Great spot overall, with plenty of screens to watch the game and great service."}
{"text":"Good good food.  Ahi  tacos are amazing.  Great patio.  Smoke friendly patio.so the wife is happy. The old ball n chain and yatta yatta.  Gonna get some tonight."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this place has a Jekyl and Hyde personality which is not necessarily bad if you know each - During the day/early evening its a nice Mexican themed Sports bar/restaurant with a good selection of beers on tap and better than average bar food.  But later at night it takes on a club like atmosphere with a much younger crowd ready and willing to party! Great place though to catch a game on the weekend and they also have a surprisingly large number of  Gluten Free menu items and friendly staff to boot! Can get quite crowded though - However the good places usually are!"}
{"text":"Reserved a cabana to celebrate 4 birthdays at 7 pm on a Saturday.  Got there and got our party started, eating, drinking, dancing...at 10:15 pm the bouncers come over and tell us we have to be out by 10:30 pm that they sold it to another party that was starting at 10:30 pm.  What!?!?  We paid $500 minimum for 3.5 hours...are you kidding me!!!!!  The management is shady and we will not be back...EVER!  No mention of this when booking the cabana...just the $500 minimum...SHADY!!!!  I would give zero stars but you have to pick one."}
{"text":"Food and service was awesome. Cannot say enough good things for the server and cooks. We sat outside and had to deal with some ashole smoking all evening that added an aroma to the experience we didn't ask for. Apparently that side of the bar you are able to smoke. Unfortunately smoke doesn't stay where it goes. Oh well, it's the day before thanksgiving and all we can say is that we and everyone else is with friends and family and this guy is drinking alone. Serves him right!"}
{"text":"So I was in Phoenix for work, and had a chance to meet up with an old friend for dinner / drinks on a Thursday night.  After dinner, we stopped at Sandbar for a quick drink to catch up around 10'ish.  First off... outdoor bar in January?  Awesome.  Coming from CA, I'm used to the warmer-than-usual winters, but having 70-degrees at 10pm?  sweeeet.    The bar itself was average, the staff virtually non-existent besides the bartenders flirting with a few patrons.  ...and the patrons?  pretty much a mix of everything you could imagine.  Blue-collar workers, business men/women, scantily-clad women whose provocative nature screamed of low self-esteem, and jersey shore wanna-be's.  So yeah, they have a bit of everything.  Decent bar for people watching, but I doubt I'd return there unless forced."}
{"text":"Stop by for lunch. Ordered mini chimis and a house margarita. Mini chemo hardly have any of the cream cheese sauce so I asked for a little more... add $1 to my bill. The house margarita was crap, I took only 1 sip. Asked for the bill and waitress didn't even ask about my hardly touched drink."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate this place.  Don't come here and plan to visit the guests you're with.  It's loud, the bar was sticky, the bartender wasn't friendly.  My $10 Patron marg, was terrible.  Every time someone wants to meet up there, I have to be the b*tch and recommend someplace else.  Like the other reviewer, Melanie, said , it was too disorganized, too loud, sloppy food etc.  It's a meat market no matter your age."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since its near my house. I gave it a 3 star but I was teetering on the edge of a two. I just didn't think the place was all that great. When we initially arrived we were quickly seated (Sunday mid-afternoon) and the waitress promptly took our drink orders. She drops of our drinks and then proceeds to disappear for a solid 15 minutes. When she came back she gave us some chips and 2 types of salsa. The chips were 100% stale however the salsa's (red & green) were actually both pretty good. So the waitress took our order and it honestly seemed that it was another 30 minutes before the food came out. I can understand the wait if the place was jam packed but I would hardly describe the place as busy when I was there not to mention all we ordered was a hot sandwich and some fish tacos. Anyway, I got a steak and pepper torta which was actually pretty decent. The bread I thought made the sandwich...it seemed fresh. My wife had some some fish tacos which she said weren't all that great as well. After we ate we promptly paid and left. The weirdest thing about this place and I'm not sure if it happens all the time but all the workers and what seemed like their friends hung out in front of the customers. Literally right next to the booth I was sitting in there were at least 3 girls just sitting there with one just straight up eating! Call me old fashioned but isn't that a big NO NO in the restaurant biz?? It just struck me as very unprofessional to be eating out in the open. One of the guys she was sitting there with who I imagine was the manager or something didn't even say anything to her! Bottom line if you were to ask me if I'd go back there I would probably say no. Food was \"eh\" and the service was sub par. To many better Mexican restaurants to come back to this place, first one that comes to mind is PoPo's right off of Bell and I think 59th Ave."}
{"text":"Brought the in-laws here, the food was blah, the service was bad. Our waitress seemed to be easily distracted, wasn't entirely sure what we ordered, and managed to hang on to what was a cold beer until it was lukewarm while talking to either a customer/friend/co-worker. Not going back, not interested."}
{"text":"Sandbar is a good place to hang out during a game day or on a day off after a bit of moto riding with a buddy. Grab a spot on the patio now that the weather's perfect, order your liquid of choice, settle back and enjoy the scenery.  Staff is quick and friendly, with a lot of hustle on those busy weekend game days.   Happy Hour menu is decent: the mini chimis come 4 to a plate topped with cheese and sides of guac, sour cream and salsa - just the right amount and really pretty tasty. The quesadilla also looks tempting. There's a good selection of craft beers; I tend to opt for the Kiltlifter but you should easily be able to find something to suit your tastes.  Simply taken as a fun spot to gather with your friends or even on your own at the patio bar, you could do much worse than stopping in at Sandbar. Right at Desert Ridge Marketplace you've got a wide array of entertainment and shopping choices. Take a bit of time to give Sandbar a look."}
{"text":"Only reason they are getting a two stars is because the food was amazing! The egg Benedict was so yummy! But the waitress was rude n snooty. the bar tender made a martini of some sort but had her finger in it trying to get a candy from the bottom as i watched from the booth, my waitress then went to get a sample of the drink. So i said dont drink that and to come her so i can explain, told her why and her response was oh its ok, i still going to try it because she was just getting candy from bottom. The girl didn't even go wash her hands or anything! That is freaking gross! Than when my waitress told the bar tender she did it right in front of us and they stared and laughed! Rude and gross, no thanks ill just go somewhere else...."}
{"text":"Nice wait staff, but food is chain restaurant Mexican.  The food was very plain tasting and uninspired."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing exciting about their signature Margaritas ... Nothing!  They honestly taste like Margarita mix (Sweet and Sour) on the rocks.  Oh the irony ... the place is called Sandbar.  Sand + Margaritas = a damn good time.  They just go together like that.  The bartenders aren't attentive whether or not the bar is crowded or not.  They're more attentive to each other.  Literally every time we flagged a bartender down she was talking to another server, fixing her hair or putting her phone down.  This was during happy hour time, on a Wednesday, kind of a low key time.  I've been to Sandbar on a Saturday evening and experience some of the same things.  I think it wasn't that much of an issue on a Saturday night because I was with about 7 or 8 other people, we were personally having a good time chatting and catching up with each other so we didn't really notice how long it took to get drinks.  I'd only visit Sandbar if a friend was having a special event or something.  I wouldn't bother going for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Security guard is awful. Came up to me and said my friend has had enough and we need to leave. Then went to her and said I was the problem. We sat at bar, weren't loud or acting drunk. Why turn us against each other, or try. Also maybe your bartender should not offer shots if you can't drink them there. Or maybe offer waters or food. And best bet let us wait outside for our cab. Obviously if we had to go why let us drive? I've worked at bars, drank at bars, I've never been treating so bad. Maybe the girl who couldn't walk should have been your focus. Not two people doing nothing."}
{"text":"Last Thursday we went to the new Sand Bar at Desert Ridge.  We found the last two open spots at the bar.  There was a good mix of people - both young and old as well as some left over from happy hour.  I ordered a margarita and asked if they \"hand make\" them or if they make them from a \"mix.\"  The female bartender replied that she could make it either way.  So, I asked for my margarita to be hand made - non of  that mix crap.  When I tasted it - it was a margarita made from a mix.  Not very good... However - the Sand Bar DID redeem itself when I ordered the Ahi Tacos!  Surprisingly, these by far - are some of the best fish tacos I have ever had!  Seared rare, seasoned with southwest spices, topped with fire roasted Pico de Gallo and guacamole and served on jicama tortillas!  AMAZING!  They are perfect for the hot AZ heat and hit the spot without filling you up!  I will definitely go back there for those tacos!  Also - the bartender - Brandon (I think) was awesome!  He was witty and quick to recommend the tacos and a complimenting beer.  Good crowd, good food, good music as well.  Get there early if you want a table..."}
{"text":"At first glance this may seem like a snobby place, but it isn't. I've been here a few times for happy hour or just to kick back, but when I celebrated my 28th birthday here last month, I knew that this place deserved a great review. We were able to get two booths and two tables in the upper area seating behind the entrance last minute, and the hostesses and our server were all equally amazing.  Now, if you're looking to hang at a place where you just want to be seen, this isn't the place. It's a relaxed atmosphere and you'll find the occassional snobs and tools (but what place doesn't have those?), but for the most part, it's pretty easy going. Dance floor, bar, water, sand, cabanas - they all add to the environment, but my thought has always been that your insight goes wtih your attitude. That being said, our service from Bree (I think that's her name?) was fantastic! She didn't mind splitting up the checks even though there were about 15 of us, and was always friendly and accommodating! Two thumbs up for her.  Somewhere in the night we ended up ordering food, which wasn't all that great, but the drinks were really good (try the lemon drops!). The music this particular night wasn't completely on point, but we still had fun. It's a place that I'm definitely looking forward to going to again."}
{"text":"My favorite location by far. Good crowd. Quick service, even when busy. Great place to sit outside. Happy Hour is great too. There's a reason every time you drove by its packed!"}
{"text":"I came in thinking this was a dive, apparently I hadn't don my research nor checked this place out on yelp. I don't know why I was so ill informed but with just a few more minutes left of the Happy Hour (and our waitress told us so we could get one of those sneaky margaritas for a steal)  (I was merely here to check it out, before I plan to bring people here)  I felt I got great service, and that the Happy Hour $4 frozen margaritas is way stronger than expected. I was looking around and contemplating how many people I could bring here and still have a sense of control over my party. It remains to be seen. I did not have any food at this visit.   This is another place I will have to return to and investigate more thoroughly, but so far it made a good impression."}
{"text":"Went here because every time I drove by there were always a bunch of people outside and was highly disappointed with what I got. Food is not that great. Dry meats and the salsa that comes on it seemed old with the brownish color it was - like it was made the day before or something. I ordered a beer so can't say to much about the drinks. The ambience was good with all the people sitting outside and the music. Service was anything but good, not sure if they were under staffed that night be we had to ask another server for napkins then when we were finished had to go searching for someone to ring up our check. Not even other servers could find ours and for some reason they couldn't ring us up either. Unfortunately I won't be  back here again. Just isn't good all around."}
{"text":"This place has gotten bad, it's for the people who wants to spend money and doesn't care where it goes. I have gone to this location about 5-6 times mainly invited by my friends and have always been disappointed  in their quality of food and drinks. Have had apple martini, long island, Pina coladas, just to try their different mixology skills. Their Pina coladas and apple martinis were too sweet with no alcohol in them, long island had more juices. Upon asking for making a better one, server at the bar  told me that he will have to charge me again. Me and my friend, on our last visit, ordered their tacos which were horrible and small. There are better places where you can get better service and food with the same prices as them. Servers/Waiters are rude and cut you short. If you ask them a question about their menu, it's almost like you are telling them to donate a kidney for you.. this place is hopeless.."}
{"text":"Went today at 10:15 am, website and menu says 10:00 for bunch, we were told they don't open until 11:00. Someone needs to fix something! To bad we had to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada fajita. Possibly the best fajita I've had. Steak seasoning was great. Would have given 5 stars if not for the cigarette smoke. A bit annoying even though you're outside.  Great staff. Lots of TV's for watching games."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a while, Rachel behind the bar is great!  Good place for happy hour and taco Tuesday's"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service was very slow had to go to bar to get drinks. Lots of smokers on patio, not sure if that's normal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm sad to see the changes in this place. It used to take the family and enjoy a happy hour and taco Tuesday. Now it's so loud and non family friendly I am sad... Please go back to the old Sandbar'!!!"}
{"text":"Get here early. That's my sage advice. For I don't know if it is always like it was on the night I was here- but there was a packed parking lot and a line that stretched all along the sidewalk. And this place has only been open for 4 days!  Maybe it was because the Iowa game was on (and this is an Iowa bar like it's sister location down the street.)  Maybe it was because it is new. Or maybe people in this part of town don't have a lot of options.  But whatever the reason . . . . .this place was packed.  Inside and out.  If you have been to any of the Sandbar locations, you will recognize all the signature signs- the colored lights strewn about, the beer specials, the sand underfoot, it's all there.  Couple that with harried servers just trying their best to keep up and you have a typical night at the Sandbar.  Service is pretty non existent so just squeeze up to the bar and shout out your order before some drunk kid yells something in your ear!  On this night- the crowd was a little young for my taste (the game may have influenced that) and the frat boy syndrome was in full swing!  If you can grab a table, the people watching is quite interesting just watch that you don't get beer spilled on you.  Don't get me wrong.  It's nice to have another option in this part of town.   I just wish the \"grown ups\" had found it before all the kids did!"}
{"text":"So I have come here a few times... Usually for lunch with friends and the food is not bad at all and the atmosphere is nice and casual. I have been here a few times at night for some drinks and it is always fun to have a DJ and hang out with friends. In all the years I have been living in Arizona, there has never been a cover charge.. Especially a 20 dollar charge for girls and 25 for boys. Uhhhhhh... What? I was seriously going there to get one drink to say cheers to Cinco de Mayo and I would of been gone in 15 minutes. No way am I paying that much when I can get in for free at clubs in Old Town. The \"bouncer\" was rude and I will never be coming here again. Not even for food. Save your money people!!"}
{"text":"Came in for USA World Cup match today. Sat at the patio bar, bartender was nice offered me a red white and blue frozen margarita which I enjoyed! I ordered a burger and wanted everything American aka bacon, cheese, they even put a fried egg on there for me! Excellent food, drinks, and service! USA!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we have been here.  The atmosphere is great and beachy.  My wife had the sampler platter - nachos, mini-chimis and quesadillas.  Everything was pretty good.  I had the (not) hot wings.  They were done with a dry rub, I wasn't expecting that.  I like a more traditional sauce.  They were grilled which I did like and they were huge which was a bonus.  They were, however, very salty, at least to me and my wife.  The other people that we were with had the fajitas and tacos.  They said both were delicious.  Service was very slow with the drinks and refills."}
{"text":"Went there to meet a gal pal for some drinks/appetizers.  LOVED the atmosphere and decor.  I'd only been here awhile back w/work folks for lunch.  Unfortunately, I remembered they charge for chips/salsa.  Don't like that.  Waiter said something about...well people come in here and drink beer & eat chips and that's it.  Well,,,who the %@#$ cares!  At least they come in!  The nachos/margaritas were great.  However, the service was awful.  We had to go to the bar to get another drink and the order took 4ever.  During the last 1/2 hour, the waiter deposited the chips.  The waiter also should never have been a waiter as he had no social skills in that department.  I won't be going back there again anytime soon unless someone else is paying!!"}
{"text":"They couldn't get my order right to save their lives... my beer was half spilled before it got to me and they wouldn't fill it back up, tried to say it was just the head that she poured all over someone when she was walking to our table. Service is poor, the cliental."}
{"text":"I just moved into town with some friends and we decided to try out some new restaurants. Without realizing it was Tuesday, we went to this restaurant to find their awesome Taco Tuesday deals, which made my food choice instantly easier. Their fish tacos are definitely my favorite. The only down side was that our server seemed to disappear for a while at a time, especially when it came time to ask for the check. Other than that I would highly recommend this place to anybody that comes to visit me."}
{"text":"Nikki the bartender is amazing and gorgeous! Recommend this place any day!!!! Try the bomb pop! She loves making it and it's delicious"}
{"text":"Now that it's starting to get hot outside I get the burning desire to swim, eat and drink!! All an amazing combination when in order!! The Sandbar brings that sensation to life, well... sort of!!  I love the misters they have for their patio and that's the sole reason why I agree to sit outside. I also love the sand layout they have with the illusion of a small body of water that to resemble a pool. So that touch is nice!! I also like the happy, upbeat service they offer!  This place has always been super friendly!!  As for the food, that is simply okay. Nothing to go crazy for, nor brag about. However, I will say that this place is a good spot to relax and enjoy a good time, and that's easy to do since It has a very joyful decor, and party feel to it!!  :)  Hope you enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"I love being outside. The industrial fan, ceiling fans, and misters, make the 105 temp bearable to sit outside (under cover), in the middle of the day. Great drink specials, different every day."}
{"text":"new in town and wanted to go out for some fun.. found this place on yelp and gave it a try.. so much fun!! der coming back :)"}
{"text":"Was in town for business, and came here for drinks. 3 Bud Lights & 1 Vodka/ Red Bull cost $48 on a Friday night- extremely pricey if you ask me. Good music, nice set-up.  Fun place, but yowza was it pricey."}
{"text":"I was expecting some fun, good service? I was expecting something! Too crowded. Stupid ass sign in the front for dress code. What is that about? This place is too much of a dump to have a dress code."}
{"text":"Love coming here!!  We come often, great for football games, happy hours, and most definitely for hangover brunches!!  The service is always good (and fast) and the food/drinks are good with a very fair price point!  Definitely recommend for a good time, drinks, and bar food.  Oh, and did I mention the awesome bottomless mimosas???"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I came to the indoor bar to order a drink because it was far slower than the outside bar. The bartender (short curly dark hair) did not sad hello, seemed annoyed to make my drink, did not speak or smile once. This is terrible customer service.  And even after tipping she just slowly walked away without a thank you."}
{"text":"This is my second time to the Sandbar, me and my boyfriend came by to grab a bite to eat. They were having an event there, I called a head of time and the lady who answered the phone told me it was happy hour and told me the times it started and ended but she didn't seem very sure of it. When we got there (about 15mins later, I live near by) it was NOT happy hour. We sat ourselves which was fine but when the waitress finally came she didn't know what specials they had and what some of the menu items were. Maybe she was new? Idk. But being a server myself at one point, I know you're suppose to know what the menu items consist of, at least be able about to tell me how something is or make a recommendation. Nonetheless the food was very good. We ordered Mexican pizza for an app and shrimp tacos and chicken fajita as the meals. Everything came out at the same time. I was upset about that bc the food was kinda cold once we finished the appetizer, but I didn't make a fuss about it. I'd def come back though bc the drinks and food were good and not too pricey and it's close to my house."}
{"text":"Sandbar desert ridge is a cool place but I will not return here for a drink. I don't know if this is a new thing or of they've always done this but I don't think it's right. I went in here 3 days ago to have a couple beers with a friend. So I ordered a beer and had them keep my tab open. They took my card and then returned it to me with a receipt they make you sign to keep you open. All it had said is that by signing this your card will be held and that they don't need a signature if you were to walk out on your tab. What they DONT tell you is that they put a 50$ hold on your card that will take up to 3 business days to return to your account. So my 9$ tab was showing 50$ in my account and I had no clue why. I called and talked to manager Alecia and she explained to me why it was showing 50$. They don't tell you any of this when you start a tab and I don't think that's right at all. So make sure to close your check every time you order a drink. Anybody know if this is legal for bars to do?"}
{"text":"It's a bar. There's some sand. Some waitresses are more concerned about their looks than their customer service skills. It's just a typical, average, North Scottsdale bar.  The location is highly convenient, and there's never a line to get in. Even when this place is packed, it doesn't feel that packed. They have ample room inside and out so you never feel squished. It's usually pretty easy to find a table but it's definitely not as easy to find a waitress/waiter that wants to serve you, especially when it gets crowded. During one of our many Sandbar visits, our waitress was so MIA that one of the security guards started acting as our waiter... It was pretty funny to say the least.     When I used to live up in N. Scottsdale, Matt and I would come here for NFL Sunday football all the time. They were also pretty accommodating when it came to changing the channel so that each of us could watch our favorite teams. I always requested the 49ers, and Matt needed to see his SeaChickens. They would even change the channel for our friend, a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan (yes, they still exist), without thinking twice. I truly appreciate a bar that accommodates fans of different teams outside of the one that happens to be playing the Cardinals that week.  This is also a fun place for Happy Hour Mon-Fri. They have great specials, and the drinks get the job done. As far as bar food goes, Sanbar's menu isn't amazing but it isn't horrific either. There have been may times when I've made a meal out of their bottomless bucket of chips and salsa. As far as the crowd goes, it's kinda random. You'll see groups of coworkers enjoying some after work brews, lots of out-of-towners, young 20-somethings getting their drink on, old creepy guys with fake tans. But for the most part, this place turns into a party scene at night. Although I am totally not a UFC fan at all, Sandbar hosts a lot of UFC nights where they put the game on the big screen projector TV, and people can reserve seats/tables in advance... just as an FYI for all of you UFC people out there.   I know what to expect from Sandbar, and it's an A-OK place in my book. I'd recommend it to anyone in N. Scottsdale looking for a fun, reasonably priced bar for happy hour or a night out. However, this just isn't a bar that I would drive out of my way to get to."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here for lunch on 3-16-2015.  Two of us are vegan which we told the waitress so she could assist us in ordering items that do not have meat or dairy products in them.  She told us that both the black beans and refried beans had meat but the rice was completely vegan.  We ordered veggie items with rice as our side dish.  The food was average and the server was friendly but very slow.  We asked for drink refills on two separate occasions and they arrived 20 minutes later each time.  It was not busy in the restaurant so it is puzzling that it took so long to refill water and ice tea.  The manager came by to ask how our food was and I made the suggestion that they offer beans made without meat for vegan and vegetarian diners.  She explained that they are in the process of changing their menu to include gluten free items and more vegetarian dishes.  She told us that currently the beans and the rice are all made with meat (chicken stock is used to prepare the rice) but they were working on changing this.  I told her that the waitress assured us that the rice was vegan and she said that the waitress didn't know.  I told her that the servers should know specifically as customers have dietary needs.  She apologized and gave us vouchers for a return trip.  I understand she was doing her best to make us happy and she was very apologetic.  It is very frustrating to eat in restaurants that do not teach their servers what is in the food or at least to make sure servers ask before guessing and bringing it out after the customer has made it clear what their needs are.  Management needs to educate their servers."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a sports bar. I've been twice: once at the height of Friday night and the other midweek for lunch. Both times the service was quick and the drinks were replenished just in time. Like many sports bars in the area the wait staff seems to be more about being a hot chick than a great server, but when the food comes quickly and the drinks don't run dry there's not much room for complaint. The burritos are good and pretty standard for a chain. The salads are really good and very big. If you're watching what you eat then go for one of them and you'll leave full and satisfied. I tried this place for the groupon but I'll definitely go back...especially for their drink specials."}
{"text":"I've now been to Sandbar quite a few times, mostly b/c it's cheap, especially for Ladies Night on Thursdays. It's a good place for a group to meet as there is plenty of seating. I guess it's true what they say, however, you get what you pay for. The happy hour special for drinks make the margaritas $4, which is a great price, especially since they are kind of strong ... I recommend the frozen peach margarita! And as far as the food goes, it is mediocre. I've gotten the nachos & the mini chimes before. Only three stars because overall, it's alright .. nothing special."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this joint.   I come from Texas and the food would never be considered Mexican  by even a chain standard.   Drinks are more club like, slow and weak.  Avoid this place at all costs or expect a high tab."}
{"text":"For the second time in a row at sandbar, we were going to order more tacos and they told us the kitchen was closed. No warning or anything. Tacos are good but service was awful. Seemed like waitress didn't care and didn't want to be here. Asked about drink menu490 E Appaloosa rd. Gilbert and our waitress says \"Jesus Christ\" in disgust. Waitress by the name of Krissy. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, and surprice, one of the better Carne Asadas I've had in Phoenix!  I can see where this place my get crazy at night, but it was a good lunch locale!  Not a must-visit, but a place I will go again."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today, food is good even my son's meal is late.. Our server probably had a bad day, not smiling and unapologetic. She serve us a water with \"fly\"... Did not even say \"sorry\"... She just said..\"ohhh\" then left change the water.. Im not coming back here.."}
{"text":"Okay, so I know this is a restaurant that has dancing at night, but damn, I had fun.   I liked the environment, it's HUGE inside and there's actual sand outside.  Call me naive but I didn't think it would be a literal sand bar, but it was.  There was also a little pool that no one went in, as usual, until the MC called people out for a competition.  Our cocktail waitress was hella cool; so nice and even gave me a free drink.  Granted the free drink was a Jameson and Coke, but hey, who refuses free booze?  Not me.  I really wanted to go into the pool  but I thought about Faces in Sacramento and no one goes in that pool.  Then again, Faces is a gay bar and Sandbar is not.  I should have gone into the pool.  There was thunderstorms and I had a beautiful view of all the lightening strikes.  It even rained and it felt SOOOO good.  The only thing I didn't like was that I had to wait very long for a drink.  Other than that everyone there was super nice, I loved the outside area, and I got a glowstick.  I know, I know, I'm a nerd, but I like what I like and I loved Sandbar.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Where do I start .....  This is a hard review for me to write because I have lived near this location for a long time and have spent many Friday and Saturday nights there simply for the night life and in all the years have never actually tried their cuisine until recently.   So in order to pay it proper tribute I will separate the two and rate it accordingly.    When it comes to a good time on any given weekend this place gets 5 stars from me. Now don't get me wrong it's probably not for everyone but for me it is a great eclectic spot with a good combination of outdoor and indoor areas. Along with a dance floor if you would be so inclined to shake those hips or an occasional grind. This is one of those places where you can find a mix of a younger and older crowd.   Now.... the food. This is where I would give it 3 stars. It's simply mediocre. It's Mexican but not very tasty. Let's put it this way after a bunch of drinks it is good drunk food and a decent way to end the night and prevent that hangover the next day.   With the liveliness receiving 5 stars and food 3 I am giving Sandbar a solid 4 stars. I will continue to go there for years to come."}
{"text":"I ate at the Sandbar last Thursday and I got food poisoning. I know it couldn't have been anything else because I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast and didn't have anything after. I had a well done burger and sweet potato fries which tasted great and I was up puking all night. I only drank one beer and I felt fine the next day so it wasn't a stomach bug. I will never go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is about drinking, and putting food in your stomach between drinks that allows you to drink more drinks whilst meeting lots of other people that are out drinking just like your are...and there's nothing wrong with that. The Sand Bar accomplishes this quite well. It's a happening bar loaded with people out to have a good time. The salsa (red & green) kicks ass. The tacos and burritos are, at best, middle of the road. If your looking to have a good time though, look no further, The Sand Bar will easily deliver on that. I'd give it an additional half star if I could just figure out how to do it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!! I would recommend asking for their chips and salsa. Most of us got the fajita special they had that particular day and it was a great deal for the amount of food. Good atmosphere for hanging out and watching football."}
{"text":"Cool place. Carnitas tacos & black bean's are killer!  I didnt like the chicken tacos.....too plan for me. Beers cold!"}
{"text":"Please read, for your sanity. This place has gone completely downhill. I have been a long time resident of the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, and used to frequent the sandbar when it was off of Shea Boulevard. Ive been to the newer location on Tatum a couple of times in the past. Last night I brought my husband and his best friend (who is visiting from out of state), to the Sandbar so we could enjoy each other's company.  Apparently, I made a poor choice in suggesting this restaurant. After being there for approximately 45 minutes we were \"asked\" to leave due to, \"having seen some stumbling\" by one of the highly intelligent bouncers...  This was a COMPLETE fallacy, as I am quite aware that we had approximately two drinks each.  After paying the ridiculously high tab, we left the bar and will never go back again.  I will be in however, one last time to discuss with the management what a disgusting display I saw last night."}
{"text":"I've come here so many times over the years I've lost count. Number of check-ins is worthless because I've been coming here since before I even knew what Yelp was. This place is a bit schizo though. On nights when it is slow, this is a pretty chill bar and a great place to hang out. On nights when it is jam packed, the douchebag index is off the charts. Food's ok - mostly stuff like fish tacos, nachos, cantina fare. Service has usually been pretty decent even when crowded. I used to come with folks from work on Fridays for happy hour but I think the dB factor became a bit much for all of us so we stopped. Same mall as BevMo so if you decide you want to bail and still have drinks, you can stop by to pick up your stash. Lots of parking in this mall."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night.  Got there around 9 anticipating it being crowded and wanted to get a table.  We got the LAST table, smack in the center of the room.  No ideal but great for people watching.  Very eclectic group of people, mostly 25 and older with a very casual atmosphere.  Didn't eat here but the drinks were watered down and overpriced.  Typical bar.  Good music, definitely geared towards the older crowd as it was mostly 90's and early 2000's hip hop which was fun.    Great for people watching and the girl to guy ratio is easily 2.5:1"}
{"text":"The Sandbar Mexican Grill is alright! I did get food poisoning from this restaurant. Otherwise the food is alright. There strawberry margaritas are alright,would not get it again. The only plus I liked about this place was the happy hour/environment."}
{"text":"The place is huge, with a large patio. Fish tacos & the chicken taco salad were both really tasty. Decent portions & prices. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they have happy hour specials going on Saturdays too.   Service was a bit slow, but the waitress was friendly. The hostess not so much."}
{"text":"We went Memorial Day with friends and had the best service ever from Omni. She was absolutely delightful. Prompt, attentive and knowledgeable. This is typically not one of my favorite places to go because of the lack of service but our friends wanted to go so I was pleasantly surprised. Omni changed my mind and I'll go back just to see her!"}
{"text":"Always was a big fan of Sandbar in my time living in Scottsdale - a nice place to sit outside and enjoy a few beers in the sunshine! They also have loads of big TV's that always have sports on for you to watch.  Price wise it's pretty good and they have happy hours a lot - Sunday being a good one as you can get pints of Dos Equis for $3 a pop! They do have a fair sized food menu but I've only ever had the chips & queso - which was very tasty I must say.  In the later hours this place dims the lights and it becomes more of bar/nightclub type place as they often have a DJ on and space is cleared for people to dance. I prefer visiting earlier in the day but both offer a less pretentious options for a few drinks compared to Old Town substitutes."}
{"text":"We were here last and only time for the fight several years ago.  Because it was crowded then, we decided to go yet again but early this time, hang out for the afternoon in to the evening, and stake our place for the long haul until the fight.  A lot of the tables were already reserved so we choose to sit at the open spots at the bar which had the multi-TV coverage.  The cover was the best I found in town, as was last fight's cover.  The bartenders were very accommodating and attentive throughout the night, as we ordered standard drinks and typical bar food on a tab.   The band that played was a definite pick-me-up and bonus to listen to as we sat, ate, drank and watched the crowd pile in.  It was standing room only by the start of the fight.  Shall I say that the crowd with all the drunkies, including myself (not overly drunk but pleasantly buzzed) was loud, animated and quite entertaining.   The actual fight though- well was not so entertaining, But at least we were in a lively place where fun was had by all either way."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Wings are amazing. Monday are my favorite. I'm a wing person, probably some of the best wings I've had. & the price is right! 5 wings for $3!"}
{"text":"I took the wife and kids here for happy hour/dinner.  We experienced friendly, great service.  They brought us a huge bucket of chips that I couldn't even finish.  The rest of the food was tasty and portions were large.    Not a bad place to stop for a snack and a beer."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places for Mexican and a great fun atmosphere.  BUT, the last 2 times I've eaten here the food has been average, the ice tea horrible, and the service so slow.  My drink came right away but the tea was so bitter I couldn't drink it.  My food was dropped off and I was half way through before anyone stopped by.  I asked for a different drink and had to ask for a napkin.  When I was completely done eating (and had been out of a drink for at least 15 minutes) did the waitress check on me.  And there was only 1 other table with people inside.   The waitress was very friendly, though and my food was good this time. The last time I was here it took 20 minutes to get our check back from the waitress so we could pay and again it wasn't busy in there. Plus our food was burned.  I had hoped for better service this time but it didn't happen."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of family members a few weeks ago on a Tuesday night... And the place was packed!  The service was way better than we expected considering how busy it was! The food was delicious and the drinks were ice cold!! The music was a little loud for my likings but it seems like it is a hit with the local younger crowds!! Will actually make this a stop on my future visits to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Ok...change if heart here...Well...if you have a party of eaters and not big afternoon drinkers you will get told to move to a less desirable table.  Even if you're a fat tipper...or would have been prior to being told to move so the alcohol party could have you table in front of the big screen. Hmmmmm...and you can reserve a cabana if you -commit to spending at least $200 if you fall sorry of the $200 you must purchase a gift card to make up the difference. Seriously?  Id rather just rent it out than be told what I have to spend to sit there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mexican food and have eaten at most of the restaurants all around town. That said, Sandbar falls short of any expectations. Our food was bleh. The red salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce, the fajitas had kind of a weird flavor to them (can't pinpoint what it was, but it was not good), and the nachos we ordered had cold, unmelted cheese on them. To top it off, the service was almost non-existent. The only thing we did enjoy was the green salsa... and when we asked for more of it, the waiter guy said coming right up ~~ and legit never came back. So we ate our meal without any green salsa to add flavor to the otherwise bleh meal. Really disappointed in Sandbar."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, with a large group of work colleagues.  Overall the experience was okay.  In hindsight probably not the best place for a large group, as the Sandbar is noisy and crowded.  Took quite a while to wait for enough tables to open up for our group.  However, for what the Sandbar is, it does well.  It is meant to be a festive, noisy, party atmosphere, with the ambiance of a beach bar in some tropical locale. While our group was waiting to get seated, we stood around the bar and had no issues getting prompt service on our drink orders from the bartender.  And then after we got our tables, our waitress took good care of us.  No long waits for drink refills, and the food orders were correct and prompt.  The food itself was average.  Not great, not bad.  Seemed fair for the prices.  And there were a lot of happy hour and daily specials to choose from.    This Sandbar is located in the Desert Ridge mall, right off the 101.  So there is plenty of parking in the mall, no worries there.  If you are looking for somewhere quiet, or intimate, you should probably skip this place.  But if you are in the mood to party, this seems a good place."}
{"text":"I can't stand this place, but seem to end up dragged here for birthday parties. Maybe it's the Saturday night crowd that makes it so awful. I'm not sure, but every time I come I leave pissed off and broke.  We usually rent one of the \"cabana's\", which really isn't worth it because it gets so crowded you end up with a bunch of random people all in your space anyhow. They also grat your check at 50 percent. YEP! Our bill for the 3 of us (yes they did split checks after throwing a fit about it) was $120.00. We had strictly beer and wine. After looking closely, the added on tip was $59.00. We never saw the server again, so we signed and left. I hate it so much here anyhow, I would have payed every last cent in my checking to get the hell out of here.  The staff is slow (though they are way overworked) and rude. The bussers and bouncers like to say \"get out of my way\". (Real nice).  I guess it would be fun here if you like getting \"totally wasted\" with a bunch of less-than 21 year old's trying to hook up and pull some sub par dance moves on the tiny inside dance floor (which you step up to get onto and people are always bailing on the stairs). So I guess if you like watching drunk people falling you should stand here!  It's just crowded, messy, rude, and reminds me of Spring Break in college seeing how drunk and obnoxious I could get in Rocky Pointe.  No thanks. Next time there is an event here I will try to plan a dinner first and skip out on \"all the fun to (NOT) be had\" here.  Maybe it's better on a slower weeknight, but I honestly don't care to find out."}
{"text":"Really fun place. Came out on my last day in Arizona. The specials are great, Tuesday 2 dollar tacos great bargain 4 dollar Margarita also awesome. I'm greatly satisfied with this place. I like the outside area really chill, wish I could find more places like this in ny!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, fun to be at. That is if you don't plan on ordering any drinks or food. We went on a taco Tuesday and it was packed so I can understand slow service but we sat there for a good 30 minutes before we were even noticed. Drinks were terrible and expensive when they were supposedly on special that night. We ordered tacos for the great price of 2$ which is unbeatable. We ordered them at 915 and our server came back at 10:05 apologizing saying she entered our order in after the kitchen had closed and that we'd have to get them ourselves from the taco cart they gave up front. We later saw her off the clock drinking at the bar less than 10 minutes later and our food ended up actually still coming out from the kitchen. At this point our tab was already paid and we left the tacos there. Won't be going back unless I'm already drunk. Don't recommend going on taco Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Service was pleasant, atmosphere was nice enough, music was really loud and thumpy for a Sunday evening, but not unexpected if you have been there before.   Food was really blah, the rice was very soupy and tasted like it came out of a rice mix packet. My mom said her taco combo plate was pretty good, but I didn't try it. I had the Chili Relleno, and it wasn't terrible, just really really bland. Unless I have an occasion to come here for happy hour/appetizers and drinks, I wouldn't be interested in coming back for the food."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the server sucked. Had to go to the bar to ask for a server.  She then walked past our table 5 times before asking is we would like something you drink. When we get our food we have to flag her down to get silverware.  The service has really declined in the last couple of weeks.  Hoping that the service improves."}
{"text":"Another great experience at the sandbar desert ridge.. Just had my wings, nachos and combo tacos(ahi baja and Shrimp) what else can i ask for i mean  beer is cheap and cold just the way I like it This place is a must visit even if u have kids. my kids love it here wild me and the wife enjoy our self's our kids do as well on the SAND!!! every time i come here i have a great time defiantly will be back oh the the DJ on Sundays.... great idea thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome, great atmosphere, great people. Terrible DJ though, guy thinks it's a night club. They need a dj that plays music for an outdoor bar, not a grind and rub club!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, fairly good food. The mango margarita I ordered tasted like a regular margarita from a big frozen mixer and was pretty damn small for $8 bucks. Enjoyed the queso and my meal, however I was pretty turned off by the service. Unfortunately you're not being waited on by experienced customer service oriented waiters. You're being waited on by a cute little twenty-something in a pair of skimpy shorts who runs by your table asking \"how is everything\" and doesn't stop or slow down to hear your answer. So am I going there for the \"five star\" service? No. But if you want a busy hang out where you can get some over priced drinks and a decent tex-mex meal, Sandbar will work."}
{"text":"sad how this place has changed. I was there with my girlfriends tonight dancing and having fun when a bouncer barged his way into our circle and said he would kick me out if I didn't contain one of the guys that was with my group. I felt super intimidated by the situation and not safe. I left to keep the peace and will for sure tell my friends and clients to steer clear of this establishment. If there was an issue with a male in the group then handle it as men, don't intimidate a female to make yourself feel better. @sandbararizona"}
{"text":"I loved this place at park west so sad it closed!!! Now we drive to Scottsdale but it is so worth it!! The atmosphere is great and the jicama salad is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick bite. The queso was superb and the mahi tacos are to die for. The ambiance was quite nice and the server was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great staff. The food here is delicious and very family friendly at the appropriate times of course."}
{"text":"Okay so maybe I'm biased because I really hate douche's and high prices for my BEER. But here we go...  I live on the north west side of town (arrowhead). So i'm closer to the other Sandbar on northern and the 101, that place is pretty hood, and this sand bar is the complete opposite...but i digress.  A friend was moving back to jersey and she wanted to meet here for drinks. I got here around 10pm on a Friday night. It was extremely packed, but I found parking, no biggie. I did like how they have a lot of taxi's lined up at the front door just encase you might need one, which I love because I cab it everywhere when I'm consuming alcohol.   No line yet at the door, I get right in with some friends. We get a table, high top somewhere. I will admit, there are some smokin hot ladies in here, and some cute cougars as well. Funny thing is, these chicks all have high heels on and when they are walking in the sand, I was hoping i'd see at least 1 eat shit. Didn't happen, then again I didn't sty long.   The atmosphere here is a typical Scottsdale douche bag bar/club. A lot of guys wanted to bang some hot girl, and a lot of hot girls looking pretty yet it's pretty obvious that they have ZERO personality.  I went to the bar to get my and my friend a beer. \"2 Coronas please\", okay, that will be $10!. Uh what the fuck did you just say to me, I asked for 2 coronas and you're telling me it's $10 for 2 fucking beers. I literally paid because I wanted a drink, hung out for a little then took off.   The over all douche bag aroma, mixed in with the high prices for a beer turned me the hell off. I'll stay on the west side, or any non douche establishment around town and wont ever come back to this place."}
{"text":"We planned a retirement party for 25-35 people.  Jacob, the manager greeted me at the door, and gave me 1st class service.  Jacob put our cake in the back refrigerator to keep it cool until we were ready to serve it.  When they did serve our cake, they decorated the cake with firework candles!  Jacob also blew up our balloons, and decorated the section we had reserved.  Jacob even \"gave\" a co-worker a Sandbar tee shirt, who had an spill! Our server Crishana was wonderful.  She had no problem keeping up with our large party.  She was a doll.   They had a special menu for large parties, and it was very inexpensive.  If you are planning a party, large or small.  Sandbar is your place!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The server was rude about not putting our order in until we closed our tab at the bar. We were here for an hour at the bar intil we got a table and then he required to have a car in his hand before he put our food orders in!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food with awesome deals during happy hour which sucks that it's so poorly ran. It's located right across the street from my job which makes it super convenient to run to for lunch. Too bad I won't be going back! Me and friend have gone at least 3 times during lunch and sat our selves and got our own menus because theres no hostess and no when even bothers to come when people come in. Service is slow the waiters do not check if you need refills or the check. We waited over 15 minutes for our waiter to come back to our table today. Then to top it off the seat on the booth was broken and i when I went to get up to leave I slipped and fell in my knee. Several waiters saw me fall and not one asked if I was alright!? Also I left my keys on the table and was looking for them in my purse outside the front door. A waiter came out with out saying a word or making eye contact handed me my keys. I said oh thank you... No response while walking away. It took me to yelling thank you sir for him to acknowledge me with a murmured welcome. I dont know what this staff is trained in but its definitely NOT customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Queso dip is always good. We typically come here every Saturday. Happy hour prices service and food have been great.  However Last 4 weeks service below average and food average.  Ordered medium sliders and so hot (spicy) couldn't even eat tonight not to mention we sat for almost five minutes before being waited on at the bar. Spend on average 50-60 bucks on happy hour - probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"A buddy and I walked in here on an extremely miserable day in Phoenix (this is of course all relative to Philly, but it was 60 degrees and rainy so not so good) for lunch and our spirits were raised instantly by 2 gorgeous young hostesses who greeted us with big broad grins.  Wow.  Of course the rest of the experience wasn't quite so great but whatever.  The Sandbar obviously caters to a young party crowd at night, there are outdoor couches and a huge bar both outside and in.  A free beer coupon from the Marriott I was staying in gave us a great start!  I expected to have great Mexican in Phoenix for obvious reasons, but this ain't the place to get it.  The dishes were an American and typical interpretation of Mexican.  Nachos loaded with so much crap on top that you could make a meal out of them alone.  I tried the sliders with sweet potato fries, they were passable, but not real Mexican either.  The bartender was extraordinarily friendly in a genuine way, not the forced corporate way which I hate.  (you know the type: and how are we doing today, sir?) Anyways, he was a cool guy.  I wouldn't eat here again, it was average, but I would gladly party later at night."}
{"text":"Things this place has going for it: - a huge ass patio. Perfect for those nights where the weather is fantastic. I could totally see myself starting happy our here and relaxing for a while. Would also be good for some Sunday morning drinking. -  decent happy hour menu with cheap appetizers and cheap well drinks - a million tvs ( if you're in to that sort of thing) - decent selection of bottled beers and a wide range of liquor (which is what I'm in to)  Things that make this place a 3 starer vs a 4 or 5: - service is suspect at best. They would have gotten a ton more money out of us if they had been on top of the drinking situation. We definitely would have ordered more if the waitress had checked on us more often - the food is nothing special. Typical bar appetizers and the entrees are just..... Ok. Better tacks have definitely been had and for a better price. Ration of cost and quantity is a bit off. - The DJ. The kid looked to be 13 and was REALLY hooked on playing the Biebs a little too much and a little too loud.  Conclusion? I'd chill out on the patio for a couple of drinks but wouldn't waste my money eating here. I'm a sucker for an awesome patio."}
{"text":"An excellent first visit.  Service was fast and friendly.   Food was great.  Generous portions and cooked exactly as requested. Excellent happy hour.   A great place we will be back"}
{"text":"It was a full house on Friday, but we snuck into a table, avoiding the hostess desk. Had a nice waiter who gave us free chips and salsa (the green is better) and then we tried the something off the $6 app menu. We had the taquitos, chicken, not beef, but the fact that only three of them come with an order is kind of a ripoff, especially when you are sharing. Basically, you gotta let you date have two and you are left starving after one measly taquito. Anyway, the beers are still three bucks and she had a glass of wine and champagne, both were five bucks. It's a madhouse on Friday and a decent people watching place, but a bigger bang for my happy hour buck is needed."}
{"text":"Impossible to have a bad time here.  Staff is fantastic, food is always on point (the carne asada anything could bring a vegetarian back to his/her senses), and there are a ton of craft beers to choose from."}
{"text":"The experience of coming to Sandbar was decent but i don't think i would go again.  The service was the most disappointing aspect of it for me. To be fair they were very busy and I understand that but it was one disappointing aspect to the service tol many. To start off we didn't have menus for a good while after we got here. When our food did arrive finally i was left silverware-less for longer then I wanted to be when I was hungry from waiting for a good while earlier to even get my order in.  I had shredded beef enchiladas that were actually not bad. Not the best I've ever had but they were better than others as well with good black beans and rice as well.    My friend had fish tacos, and this part of my review is hearsay admittedly, but he didn't like them too much. He could tell that they had used frozen mahi. If you have fish that's been frozen you're not going to have a good time. Truth.   So while I had food that was good enough my overall experience did not merit a return visit."}
{"text":"Ehh... Great place to grab drinks with friends. The food is nothing to go out of your way for. They would do better during lunch hours if they ran better lunch specials as their are a lot of business people in the area looking for a decent place to sit down for lunch. Tried a few different things on the menus and nothing has ever left me craving for it again. I have gone there on Friday and Saturday night for music and drinks and this tends to be the best time to enjoy what sandbar is about."}
{"text":"everything about this place is awesome if you're in the mood for a big crowd and fun time but the prices are a little too high for my liking. Food is pretty great, beer is awesome and people here get pretty wild and funny. Lots of heat lamps, TONS of places to sit and a great vibe all around.  Come here during happy hour or anytime day or night on the weekend for a good time. Peace out."}
{"text":"Service is slow and inconsistent. Feels like the waiters are never around. Went in to the bathroom and some lady had a full course meal set up on the bathroom counter. Along with the various plates of food she had what looked like all of her Belongings just spread over the counter. Told my waiter when he finally decided to check on our table and his response was just that \"she does our napkins\". Not the best thing for business lol."}
{"text":"Next stop! The SandBar \"cervezas buey!\"  Dance club at night, relax during the day time. Its Bi-polar goodness!  Rolled with my friends and the 'tenders were professional and according to my one of my friend were all \"7up's.\" As long as they can make my drink strong and quick its \"Sigur Ros phenomenal.\"    4friends, 4 partons, and 4 hours later the dance floor was too small for us! Minus the midlife crisis'ers it was worth the drive.   Great place to visit when in Phoenix.  Hint: its ok to bring sandals, you may want to feel the sand between your toes, good touch Sandbar.   + the Scottsdale SandBar brings a larger crowd  R\_"}
{"text":"Here is an update to my earlier review! In fairness, management was listening. I arrived on a Thursday night and it was busy but not ridiculously packed. The crowd still seemed trashy but they were at least well behaved this time. I think management deserves credit for that. You didn't see the typical Golds Gym meatheads thinking they are dressing trendy with their Underarmor black shirts and jeans! A noticeable change was the staff! The bartender was actually polite and friendly and didn't have the faux wannabe Scottsdale attitude. Waiters and busboys kept coming around asking if we would like refills on drinks. There was a table of beautiful women that deliberately sat inside to avoid the crowd outside which tells me a lot about this place...namely they were there for the drinks prior to venturing to Scottsdale and didn't want to be disturbed by all the guys outside. It was definitely not a pick up kind of place. And in terms of diversity...what people are really meaning to say are African Americans! It was still 90% white but just seeing any color at a Phoenix venue is a nice change and shows that our state is making progress; it definitely felt less NASCAR if you know what I mean. The dress code and cover charge for guys is a good start and it has helped eliminate the shadiness so the management deserves much acclaim for this.   However, there were still problems. The management has to better control the parking area. Some type of security needs to be present at all times in the parking lot because you can still see random guys pissing on cars and groups huddled that a look a bit sketchy. The dress code for the guys has to be better emphasized. Non-sneakers and non-baggy jeans doesn't do enough especially when 40 year old Joe shows up in a polo shirt, and bleached jeans. Dressing well is not limited to Scottsdale. How about something as simple as a black button down shirt, nice jeans and leather shoes! Lastly, the female waistaff and service has NOT improved. They could learn a thing or two from the guys. There was still a lot of that stuck attitude that was present in November. The management needs to better emphasize friendlier service from their female waitstaff and bartenders."}
{"text":"$2 Taco Tuesdays is my favorite. Although I order the $3 seared ahi and jicama tacos! :) They're out of this world delicious! They also have tasty frozen margaritas. Try the chambord or peach. Xo"}
{"text":"Never again!!  A friend and I tried the Sandbar since it was new to the Desert Ridge area.   And we've hit every place there more than once... so, we thought we'd give this place a try.   In my mind, Sandbar is more pick-up joint/bar than a restaurant.  There were several tables near us with groups of cackling, screaching women... (a-hem.. do you really think men find that attractive???)   So, the atmosphere killed our relaxing quiet dinner.   The table they placed us at had an interative computer screen built into the table top... which... BE CAREFUL when sliding into the booth... I hit my knee on the corner of that thing-- it hangs down rather low... couldn't cross my legs because it was in the way and the edges were sharp.  Anyway... the brightness of the screen was too obtrusive.. again, not conducive to a quiet relaxing dinner.  We tried to block out the glare with napkins and the salt and pepper shakers- rather unsuccessfully.   The food and service was also very disappointing.  I had the shrimp tacos and had 3-4 small shrimp on each tortilla.  I had to send my dish back 3 times -- yes THREE times, because I asked for no tomatoes - explaining I am severely allergic.  First plate-- tomatoes on the tacos.  Second plate-- they stated they just removed the tomatoes from the tacos and handed it back to me.  Third plate-- tomatoes as a garnish.   After all that... there ended up being no flavor!      The server was friendly, but not very attentive, as we had to sit for quite awhile with empty glasses and had to ask for refills more than once.   Ok younger set... HAVE AT IT!    It's a big 'no' for me."}
{"text":"It was supposed to be a joyous celebration to be here, to enjoy life, friendship, and 13.1 miles stronger, but in the end, it didn't end up that way.  My friend and I came here to the Sandbar restaurant and Grill here at the Desert Marketplace after finishing the 2016 Lost Dutchman 1/2 marathon on Sunday, 2/14/2016. However, one additional thing was also lost: my wallet. I wish it didn't come to that, especially on vacation, but it happened. I spent the entire lunch experience here at the Sandbar restaurant and grill to cancel my credit cards, and grief over how I could be so careless about these kinds of things. On the bright side though, the Sandbar restaurant and grill seemed like an okay place, especially due to the beach / tropical theme going on with the surfboard tables and the bar looking Hawaiian like. Almost felt like home in a way. I actually liked the decor, although it was genuinely warm near midday. Can't say that the overall experience was good here at the Sandbar restaurant and grill, although going through the process of canceling credit cards can be a tedious process. :-/  The Sandbar restaurant and grill is located at the Desert Ridge Marketplace in the desert ridge zone of Phoenix, AZ at 21001 north Tatum Boulevard. They accept the major credit cards, so that's always a plus. This time around, I did not have them but, fortunately for me, my friend opted to pay for lunch since I was in her city and state. We sat near the entrance, since that's the where the first empty table was. The prices here are decently good, a good selection of tacos, and whatnot, and they're competitive with other Mexican restaurants anywhere in the city of Phoenix and in the rest of Arizona. The parking situation is considered plentiful because they are anchored by the Desert Ridge marketplace, a delightful shopping haven that has basically everything and anything you want. It was here that I had discovered my wallet was missing. The service was decently good. The server who waited on us was sympathetic to my current plight and that made me feel a little better as I was on the phone with the credit card companies.  I wished that my review for Sandbar Mexican grill was more positive, but it is what happened with me on this visit. I ended up getting the shrimp tacos, which ended up getting eaten at my friend's home later in the day. I took a box and finished 2 of the 3 tacos, along with the beans and rice, it came with. My friend had ordered the chicken tacos, which she thought was good and delicious. My shrimp tacos were pretty good, if I say so myself - after heating it back up in the microwave. I thought the server dressed like how they were in Hooters (restaurant), but I guess that's how they dress up at the beach, in tank tops, to fit in with the theme of the restaurant. Still this visit to the sandbar Mexican grill was a pretty good experience, notwithstanding. I will come here again if I chose to Phoenix permits it again. For me, it was good here. It would have been a lot more fun, if I didn't lose my wallet, but that's not the case.  I'd like to recommend Sandbar Mexican grill, especially during happy hour where, I'm sure the drinks are flowing and the ambiance is terrific. While I didn't drink this time, I suspect that this place would be rocking, if I did. Or at least, I would be a little rocky. The time I was here at Sandbar, it was midday and it was past brunch.   4 stars. Food is good, service was good too.  Support local!  B"}
{"text":"Called today to ask about their Cinco De Mayo event. Woman on the phone was a real you-know-what. Asked her how much the cover charge was and she had no f****** clue. She tells me $10 per person and it's going to increase as the night goes on and they don't know what their limit is. You don't know what you're limit is? $100? $300? $2500? We went elsewhere instead. For $10+ cover, you'll have a lot better time elsewhere. Will never be going back to this crap shoot."}
{"text":"The service is great but the value for your dollar forget. Two dollar taco Tuesday must be for an empty shell cause I when received the bill certain meats cost more and there is hardly any in the shell. Big rip-off.  Go to taco bell better value more meat."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place under 2 stars Is BORINGGG because sandbar is awesome! The only downfall was the hostesses. They were lame and seemed nervous to talk! Definitely didn't match the loud/ fun ambience around us. Bartender was amazing and food was delish."}
{"text":"Service has sucked every time I have been there.  One Monday night football game, our server just disappeared.  Staff couldn't even find him.  About 45 mins later he comes with our check and another 30 mins we get our change/charge cards back.  The food is actually pretty decent.  I had their cerveche and their quesadillas...very fresh and tasty.  Tons of TV's and cool atmosphere.  If they were to fix the service I'd go there more often."}
{"text":"$2 taco Tuesday. Went in the afternoon. Not crowded, decent service and great tacos. The ahi tacos are great, the carnitas are great and the chicken are mediocre.  The person I was with had shrimp tacos and said they were delicious with lots of good sized shrimp. The main page says not good for kids. Probably not for toddlers but you can take your older kids here. I wouldn't bother trying on a fri or sat night as it is apparently a young party crowd.  Overall, better than I expected."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon to try out this place.  The first time I went, it was happy hour and our waitress said our groupon wouldn't be eligible for happy hour prices.  That was okay by myself and my husband and we decided to use our groupon another day.  The drinks were watery, but the appetizers were very good.  We were excited to come back and use our groupon.  Our 2nd visit was at the end of happy hour.  We ordered off the menu and informed our waitress that we had the groupon.  She asked us if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if it was ok, since we were using a groupon.  She assured us it was ok.  Our food arrived and we had a total of 2 drinks.  When we requested the check, our waitress informed us that we could only use $12.00 of the $20.00 groupon...(I had paid $10.00, so this wasn't much of a deal).  My husband suggested to seperate the checks and pay cash for the drinks, we were told that wouldn't be allowed.  Get the $12.00 discount or pay for the entire bill.  We decided to use the groupon another day and pay the check.  We were not happy.  Very poor customer service, especially since we tried to cover all our bases and the waitress made the mistake.  BEWARE GROUPON USERS!!!!   The only reason we are going back is to finally be able to use our groupon.  We WILL NOT be purchasing any alcohol, appetizers or desserts....just the entrees and water.  My husband works with a well known computer company and he is letting any and all know about the poor customer service at this place and to not use them for corporate events."}
{"text":"Always a great time!  We take our kids and sit outside patio. Always friendly hostess' & servers. Hubby loves the baja tacos. Cants go wrong with anything on happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Worst service, the food was not good either! The tortilla soup was so under seasoned! Do the have cooks, a chef who knows what salt and pepper are!"}
{"text":"It's a fun place to be, you know, with the let loose business crowd untucking their shirts at 6 PM while the lonely cougars prey on the young men who are there to pre-game until they are \"totally wasted bro\" status before they run off to Blue Martini to avoid paying $12 per Bud Light.   Food is average but tastes amazing as you slurp down the sweet and sour mix they pass off as a premium margarita served to you by the spray tan orange, fake everything bartender that is skipping her ASU classes to make a few bucks so she can, yup, spray on some more orange.   There are apx. 524 TVs in this place which is great for game days, but except a royal shit show from all attending. It seems to be the norm at good ol' Sandbar."}
{"text":"Great food, TVs with sports and music videos on every single one, live band plays some pretty good music to. Never been there for the nightclub but judging by the atmosphere it seems well worth being there past 11pm...my favorite thing about this place though is that it's UFC friendly. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun Friday or Saturday night; or a great place to eat on any day of the week."}
{"text":"Thursday is ladies Day!! Mmmmm! Great nachos and guacamole!! Affordable prices. I would recommend to all the ladies out there."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour 4-7! fast service... not 100% sure of sitting in the sand though... staff were great and very attentive to clearing used plates, putting down the blinds, turning on the heaters.   Happy Hour 4-7, ALL appitizers 50% off and plenty of drink specials from $3 drafts."}
{"text":"Went here with a some friends for drinks around happy hour time. With the weather being really nice out, we liked the open restaurant concept--we could feel the cool breeze coming inside. I found myself watching the last bits of a nba game.. on one of 30 flat panel screens! Each table inside had a great view to nearby tv. I would love to come back for football games! We ordered off happy hour menu--$5 margs and $3 draft beers. We also had some chips and guac. The bucket of chips they plumped down was huge and the guac had nice big chunks of avocado. Between the 3 of us, we didn't feel hungry enough to order dinner after! After 9 or 10 this place turns into full on bar and sometimes there is a cover for guys. That's probably the only knock I have.."}
{"text":"When it comes to nightlife I usually hit a dance club, but a friend of mine decided to switch it up last Saturday and do Sandbar. Having never been there I thought a restaurant would be an odd place to spend a Saturday night, thankfully I was wrong!  The bouncers at the front managed the line very well, they were efficient and friendly. Once in, the place itself was colorful and very lively. The crowd was young, mostly in their twenties with a few older groups. The bars are huge and there is an actual dance floor (which I was surprised and greatly thankful for). The drinks were normal priced and the bartenders that helped my friend and I were very sweet and nice. Great security and bartenders, overall wonderful staff and service.   There's indoor as well as outdoor seating and outside there is actually sand which I thought was cute hence \"sandbar.\" Although it was raining that night, the rain didn't fly  in or get us wet, the heaters were also on and were placed strategically well around, keeping the place consistently warm despite being opened to the cold and wet night. The bathrooms were clean and brightly lit to be able to fix makeup and check yourself properly.   The crowd was good too. We weren't harassed and we were able to keep our spot by the bar without any problems. Overall, everyone seemed nice and chill.  Oh and the DJ was great! There was a mix of electronic music as well as hip hop throughout the night.  It was a good night. Although, we were there just to drink and dance, not really to eat - so next time I'll try actually ordering food, seeing how this place is a restaurant. :P"}
{"text":"There is no justification in the service I received. I went to meet a couple of friends the Friday before last. They happen to run into a friend of theirs. That gentlemen ordered some shots, drinks and dinner. I heard him tell the bartender it was on his boss's tab. A while later they tried to get him to pay his tab. He said \"I told you it was on my boss's tab\" Long story short, his boss had left and they never put it on his tab. Some time goes by, the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman I was sitting with. He asked if we knew this other man. The gentleman I was with says he knew him a little, I stated I've never met him before. The manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab. (I personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional) We did not come here with this man, it is not our responsibility). I've bartended in Scottsdale and Vegas. It is the server/bartenders responsibility  to get the credit card when starting a tab. After all, they did make sure to get mine. The manager stated it was just 1 drink ('what's the big deal'?) I clarified with him that it was just one drink? Again he stated yes. I didn't want to deal with trying to get some man I don't know to pay his tab and I didn't enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense, so I said \"If it's just one drink, put it on my tab\" (which I shouldn't have to do). The manager shook my hand and said thank you.  30 min later I closed out my tab. Keep in mind all I had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink. My tab was $62.00!!! The bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine. I called her over and I told her I found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful. She stated I said I would pay for the whole thing. I stated that was incorrect, she continued to argue with me. Why are we arguing? This is not my friend nor my tab. There is NOTHING to argue about.   She finally went to speak to the manager. After about 10 minutes, she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00. She never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his. I understand I said I would pay for this mans drink, but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab they'll have to eat. Every bar has a spill/comp tab. They shouldn't make anybody else responsible for this...On top of the unprofessionalism, arguing, lack of apology, and wait time to get this solved. As a person who runs a business myself, if my employees neglect to follow protocol (ie; neglect to obtain credit card in this case,) I eat the cost. I most certainly wouldn't have another paying customer cover it.  To make matters worse, myself and a friend (who frequents this establishment) went in to talk to a manager about this incident. I gave the MOD my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone. It has been 10 days. I never yelp about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... They lack professionalism big time in this place."}
{"text":"Went to Sandbar to watch Cardinals game. Food was fine and service was ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"If you like loud annoying hip hop music, go for it. The food is off too. Never goin back."}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation and was told they don't take reservations. We went anyway and there was a 45 minute wait. All the empty tables I saw had \"Reserved\" cards on the table. Care to explain that one? Never mind you lost a customer who is local and decided to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Always good. Good portions and good food. Service is always friendly and prompt. This is an awesome go-to place for Sunday happy hour."}
{"text":"First time here- I ask for a beergarita & receive a Blue Moon draft with margarita mix and tequila. BLEGH! And it was $9 to boot. I drank half and couldn't finish the rest. The bartender was some unattentive guy who kept twirling the bar shaker around. It was a terrible experience & I'll never return!"}
{"text":"We have always loved the Sand Bar. It's great. We love the sand on the large outdoor seating area & the colorful lights hanging overhead. The place is so casual. I like taking my shoes off & walking in the sand :-) Their food has always been good. There is always a great crowd of customers there. We went to the new one at Desert Ridge...I like it much better than the location near Shea (they moved). It's like a little vacation to the beach just down the street :-)"}
{"text":"Love the concept of Sandbar. But they try to sneak in smaller portions. Also, all 8 times I have been here, the bill was \"accidentally\" charged full price instead of Sunday-football drink prices. All 8 times. You can say, \"OMG, I'm so sorry,\" so many times until you are no longer believable. Where is your integrity?"}
{"text":"The queso dip is good. Our service wasn't good, the peel and eat shrimp tasted old and spoiled. Salad never came. Fajitas were drowning in grease."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent visitor at Sandbar. I'd like to preface this review by saying this is specifically based on my visit on NYE 2017/18. Started out as a great night. Good mix of music, food, and drinks. After the ball dropped, another DJ took over. That DJ was horrible. He played the same 10 songs repeatedly. We had a party of 8 and it killed the whole vibe. We originally chose sandbar because it normally plays good music and has a good vibe. This time was not the case. Please realize that the music is what fuels the party; and if that is not on point, then the crowd will not respond well. The dance floor became ghost town once the same songs kept being played. 2017 was a great year in music and Sandbar chose to ignore that. Please prepare better music to ensure your crowd actually enjoys themselves. Especially on New year's."}
{"text":"I would not recommend Sandbar Desert Ridge for any type of party.  Planned my daughter's 21st weeks in advance.  When we showed up, the Asst. Manager wasn't there, no one seemed to know about it, we had to be asked to be moved to a better area of the restaurant, the food arrived over an hour late - by then, most of the 25+ guests already were starving and ordered off the menu.  Service was slow so we ended up going to the bar on our own.  Most of the food I ordered was wasted, since people had already eaten.  Total disappointment.  When I tried to contact assistant manager and manager, neither bothered to actually contact me to find out how everything went or to return my calls.  Wow, they seemed so helpful when I was planning this expensive party, but after my credit card cleared, they didn't seem to care anymore."}
{"text":"Very good food... love the sand... and good music at night.... service is good for what you want in this scene."}
{"text":"decent crowd, good vibe. however, the food sucks and bottled beers are $5. plus a cover charge on weekends? hello, this is chandler, AZ.....if i wanted scottsdale prices i would go there and visit much cooler places. this sandbar, however, is much better than the morgue that they call sandbar on scottsdale & shea.   not bad if someone invites you to go there, but if i'm picking i'm going somewhere else. people watching is good, a mix of normal people, professional people, losers, skanks and aspiring porn stars..so that's entertaining..."}
{"text":"Dj sucks dick, bouncers are way to aggressive tacos are ok. Nothing here sets them apart from Douchy hipsters in Tempe."}
{"text":"I will never go back, unless it is free, and then I will still think twice.  I joined staff from the company I work for at an End of Summer Celebration on 9/6/13 from 3-6PM.  The food was excellent, the atmosphere on the patio was acceptable.  It was still a tad too warm out to be on the patio IMHO.  I asked our very inattentive server for an ice water with my beer when I first got there.  They brought the beer pretty quickly but I had to ask again almost 45 minutes later for the water.  When I ordered a second frothy beverage shortly after finally getting my glass of water, it took forever and they brought me the wrong brand.  (The place wasn't that busy) By that time I was hot, tired, and pissed, so I decided to take the opportunity to go home just before 5PM.  The company was good, but the service sucked beyond words.  It isn't worth the chips and salsa to be virtually ignored, especially when you are there with a moderate sized group."}
{"text":"Known for the atmosphere and fun environment - YOU HAVE TO TRY THE FOOD!!  I love coming to this place for happy hours, birthdays, weekends, etc.   However, last week I came on Saturday for lunch with a group of friends that eat here regularly.  We actually drove from central Scottsdale because they raved about the tacos. Being a Mexican food lover I couldn't wait to try these tacos and I'm super picky.  I ordered the taco platter which comes with three large tacos. My biggest challenge (like always) was deciding which kind to get. I ended up getting a carnitas, chicken and carne asada taco. I figured I'd like one more than the other but each of them was fantastic!  Each had their own special flavor and unique taste. There was nothing bland about it.  The margarita was perfect and the chips and salsa were amazing also. Try both the green and traditional salsa - again I'm picky and I could have eaten 10 servings of this. Everything was amazing. We will be back very soon for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My review is solely for the nightlife/dancing.  I haven't had any of the food or mixed drinks, just beer and dancing. Living in Cave Creek, Old Town seems way too far away in general and certainly way too expensive of a cab ride away. Going out and dancing to music that isn't country music seems to be limited to either the Blue Martini or here (if I'm wrong, some one please tell me!). Sure the dance floor isn't big and sure not a ton of people get out and dance, but the DJs have always been good enough and I've always had a good time. I'm from California so I like the bar vibe (wannabe beach bar). The parking lot is giant so it's nice to not have an issue with that too."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, Taylor and Kat were extremely inviting and friendly!!!! Taylor was extremely confident, sharp, and personable. \"Service is black and white, hospitality is color,\" I found a hostess that left not only a good impression, but a lasting impression. She is absolutely likable with spark. Compassion, enthusiasm, team player, and polished are just a few of the many attributes that come to mind when it comes to Taylor and Kat. She is truly a valuable asset to this restaurant and I will continue to be a repeat customer and spread the word about this place as long as she continues to work here. Best hire ever!"}

{"text":"The service here is never stellar and it's too loud.  Happy hour prices are good and the food is fine, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was my very first time here and I had the worst service. It was a Sunday so I know all the games are playing and everything and the employees are gonna wanna watch for a second, totally fine. BUT YOURE STILL AT WORK. My waiter was standing watching the game for 10 minutes straight while me and my friend were waiting for him to come take our order, then he walks RIGHT past us about 3 times. I had to wave him down. We never would have eaten if I didn't. Our food came and we had no silverware so again, waited for him to just check up on us and he never did. My friend had to get up and go ask him for silverware so we could actually eat. Didn't see him again until I had to WAVE HIM DOWN AGAIN for our check. The busser took better care of us than the waiter. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Warning, Do Not go here!! Went here with a group of friends Halloween weekend.  Our group paid the cover charge to get in, they had advertised on facebook that women are free to get in which was not true.  As soon as we paid to get in my husband was turned around two steps in the door by the bouncers to the parking lot and informed him he can't go in.  My husband went peacefully outside and asked for his money back that they took from him for a cover charge.  He was then tackled to the ground by the thug bouncers busting open his lip and giving him a sprang ankle.  He was out in the parking lot!  My husband was not hostile, and just wanted to have a good time with our friends not to be attacked by the staff for no reason!  This place doesn't care about it's customers and feels it's in their right to assault anyone they choose to pick on.  Do not support this club/restaurant... I will be telling everyone to stay far away.. My husband is a gentle man and would not cause any trouble. Also the club is loud, overpriced, crowded, dirty, and has really shitty music.."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here on a Monday for a quick lunch.  I ordered the carne asada burrito.  It came with sour cream, guacamole, rice and beans.  I held the beans.  The carne asada was so tender - so tender that I couldn't stop bragging about it.  The server brought us a large pail of tortilla chips with two types of salsa (green and red).  The service was great - the server re-filled my co-worker's tea without him asking and my water was also re-filled.  My lunch came to $12.00 which was very reasonable.  The food arrived quickly, the temperature was right and it taste great.  We wil definitely return.   One negative comment is that the music is too loud.  It's hard to talk to your co-worker or friends when the music is so loud."}
{"text":"Bought a round of 4 drinks and my bill was $22...whHOoOAAahhh?? The crowd is surprisingly diverse. Dance floor area near the bathrooms. Bar height tables, chairs, plenty of seating. Outside patio area. Great music and music videos and sports on the screens. They serve food too. They were pumping steak smell directly to me it was soooo tempting!  I enjoyed it there =)  -They do have door men, they said girls free so Im assuming guys pay a small cover"}
{"text":"Only 2 stars because the service and food was good. Here's my problem- the tables and chairs are awful!!! I could not put my legs under the table. Apparently they bricked the sand area so now the tables are about 8\" lower. It felt like I was at the kids table the whole night. I had to stand most of the night. Having said that, the waitress was great. But an ergonomic freaking nightmare."}
{"text":"Tuesday $2 tacos... excellent deal for lunch!  Highly recommend Baja, Ahi, and carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends went here around 12:30 a.m. after leaving McFadden's on a Saturday. Ladies entered for free. $5 cover for guys.This place was POPPING. The DJ was on point! I stayed on the dance floor the WHOLE time that I was there... shaking my sh!t. lol. The crowd was a mixture of young, old, Caucasian, and Hispanic. ...Unsurprising, not many blacks. Bar service was quick.  Overall, great atmosphere. Everyone was festive!  If you want a place to meet friends, people watch, or dance the night away, this is your place."}
{"text":"Had such a fabulous expierience last Taco Tuesday at this restaurant. The food is fabulous, but the service was impeccable. Our server, Melissa went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied with everything even as busy as she was. Thank you for all the great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Thursday all day 1/2 priced drinks and appetizers for ladies. Normal happy hour Monday thru Friday 4-7"}
{"text":"We come here every Tuesday and have Amber as our server almost every time and she always gives incredible service every time. We are never disappointed, she is the best!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food and fairly inexpensive. Salsa was good,  but the other food items weren't all that memorable. The bar is where it is happening at this place.  An outdoor setting with sand everywhere just like a beach front bar.  Staff is friendly.   Seems busy even during a weekday.  Could be a fun atmosphere later in the evening."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start here. Nachos where great, though I'm thankful our server didn't carry them out, I think the shear weight of the plate alone just might crumble her scrawny malnourished frame. After I opened my eyes to more than the 40 ish tv's around I began to notice the Ethiopian malnourished look is a trend, along with the jersey shore huge upper body and tooth picks for legs. About lost my appetite at the site of the employees, I really wish I had. I ordered the Cx sandwich and the bread was great...  Cx average, the chipotle mayo I think was mixed wrong it was cloyingly sweet and not spicy at all. And the fries came to my table half mashed ( sooo soggy). As for the good a 5$ cover charge for UFC fight 185 not bad, however we had to bribe the manager to turn the horrid music off and play the fight!   The drink specials... Well if a 3$ domestic draft is good then you are golden... That's full price at my restaurant/bar! So there was a bit of sticker shock when we got the bill!   All in all, we might go back for another fight if friends want to go, but for the price we paid I could havemade filets and lobster, a bottle of skull, the comfort of my couch watching the same fight, and be in my pj's with my hubby!"}
{"text":"Terrible service the fucking bathrooms are out both of them and they make you pay the people in the bathroom to put soap on my fingers"}
{"text":"Visit Sammy.. She's usually running the outside bar.  Very bubbly, upbeat, and happy to see everybody all the time... like she loves her job!  Very popular bar for sports (there's a ton of tv's), good food, good staff, overall great environment.  There's an inside and outside bar which makes it pretty unique.  It's my favorite bar to watch football games at.  Don't know why it's 2.5 star... definitely better than that. May not be a 5 in all eyes but it's not a 2 or a 3. See for yourself"}
{"text":"Live entertainer (Vaughn SWIF Willis)  was great,  an added value to the evening.    The drinks were so so,  had to order a double, to taste the heat and I'm a light drinker.  The mixologist were nice.    Nice friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.... But, the service is horrible and food is mediocre. If I could leave a no star I would! We went in one evening for a friend's birthday (against our better judgment) and asked for a glass of the house Cabernet.   After having 4 glasses of wine between the two of us, we asked for the check. Our bill was over 56.00 for just those 4 glasses. Mind you, we had been here before and know how much the house wine truly costs. When we asked our server about it, she told us that WAS their house wine.   This is just one of the numerous horrible experiences we've had at this place. We have finally told all of our friends that we just won't go there at all anymore even if it's their birthday."}
{"text":"So this is my rant about Sandbar. I thought it was a cool hangout. You would figure Sunday Funday would be lively and lots going on. I thought the green salsa was bomb. But I had the shrimp tacos and I wasn't really impressed.  I hear that Taco Tuesday they spice things up a bit but that's the way it should always be. Don't get me wrong the shrimp tacos were ok but I think there should of been a little more pop to the shrimp. The servers just did not seem lively at all, likely that they were just not motivated at all. Ok well I know I have written a novel but just wanted to spread the word"}
{"text":"Myana was a Very Nice waitress. She made it fun. Fun atmoshpere and good food. But our business as a group had a blast."}
{"text":"FUN, FUN, FUN!! Great place to meet w/people after work. ALWAYS the best Boxing!! Vanilla flavored Draft,...always watched all of the CANELO fights up here. Great service, super fun atmosphere,..never been let down."}
{"text":"Once again it proves that good customer service pays off in so many ways. Return clients, referrals, happy customers. But not for Sandbar. Customer service was non existent on my visit here tonight. I had to flag the waiter first time after sitting for nearly 10 minutes. We had to flag the waiter again to ask for more salsa. Nobody ever checked on us while we were eating. The food was just all right."}
{"text":"This place is just a pick-up joint. They try to bring in people, but the food just doesn't taste the festive vibe it claims. Meh"}
{"text":"Came here for Mexican food one night - it was closest to our hotel and we constantly drove by it so we thought we'd give it a shot.  The place definitely gives off a club vibe.  If the lights you can see swinging around by the road aren't enough to prove that, the incredibly loud music blasting on the patio is.  It wasn't really our scene, so we sat in the bar (still noisy with TV's but not as bad).  Service was great - our server was helpful and very friendly.  Food was OK - the nachos were pretty good but everything else was just pretty average.  Happy hour prices on margaritas is a pretty good deal.  Overall, not a bad place.  Affordable, but loud and not amazing in quality.  Seems to have fairly consistent average reviews - which is exactly how I would rate it."}
{"text":"Ugh, we were so excited to try this new location.  We went today for happy hour.  The food was awful, I bit into a taquito and I got a mouthful of greasy beef chunk.  I had to spit it out and put it to the side.  I couldn't take another bite.  The guacamole looked and tasted like out of a bag.  Even the premium margarita was not good.  I was so disappointed since they are close to our home.  Won't be coming back, ever."}
{"text":"Cool looking place.....  Crappy service, terrible food for the $$, likewise for the overpriced drinks you might be able to get.  Too bad, never again.   Will stick to all the other awesome drinking places in the Ridge."}
{"text":"So went to watch the fights good bar but damn the service blows other than the guy bartender that helped us but damn the girl bartenders are a joke everytime one of the other male employees comes around its like watching a bunch of horney teens rubbing on each other ... like get to work ladies fuck your job ain't hard this aint a play grab ass with male employe hour took almost 10 min each time to order a drink due to the grab ass games going on behind the bar ridiculous.. and one of the bartenders actually told me that my chewing tabbacco was horrible and how she didnt want to see it well then moron dont give me a spit cup then ill go back but will never sit at the bar agin"}
{"text":"Went here for ladies night last week with a friend. We ordered the nachos with ground beef which were so good and addicting! Our server was nice and attentive even with the place being packed. We will be back for ladies night again! Can't beat 1/2 off drinks and plus the weather is finally perfect for sitting outside."}
{"text":"i loved the decor of the place, it's laid out well.  I enjoyed the hefty serving of guac but the salsa needs some serious work.  Tasted like tomatoes and vinegar, bleh!  Happy hour prices are pretty reasonable for the area.  Ladies night is nice but kind of a slow/boring night.  Word to the wise!!!  DO NOT PARK DOWN WIND OF THE MISTING SYSTEM!!!  My car was coated with junk. Made driving in our bright AZ sun kind of scary!!  I had to take it to be professionally cleaned to get the film off my car.  Major buzz kill"}
{"text":"This is a shithole place. The food smells like it came from a sewer filled with rats that dedicated in their own urine.  Desert ridge is a great venue but should expel such a restaurant and bar that serves food that reeks of disease."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- A+ I am...afterall a California girl so sand and water=WINNING! Food was ok. Something I try to remind myself is that places like these are more atmosphere and cocktails then food and the end of the day bar food is bar food, usually fried in some way and it hits the spot. I love their margaritas! The happy hour is good too. I went with a friend and we just hung out for hours talking and laughing. I really enjoyed that. The thing I didn't love was the service. Be friendlier ladies! Smiling is not a crime. I felt like we had to work to pull our server out of her shell when really it should be the other way around. All in all I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sandbar has some decent prices but beware. If you order a margarita, you'll get a bonus serving of heartburn for your value price. There is so much sweet and sour in them that they embarrass authentic Mexican restaurants.   On the weekends, at 10pm, a small end of Sandbar turns into a dance floor with a cheesy island photo lit up as the background. The DJ is terrible because he plays about 20 seconds of each song and then trainwrecks right into the next one. I think that the game is to see how many tunes he can crank out in one session as opposed to getting people to dance.   The outside patio is pretty nice. TVs are visible from most seats and the sand is a nice touch. There is even a projection screen at one end that they lower when the sun goes down. There are also heating lamps for the chilly nights. However, if you sit outside - flirt with your server so they think you care and will pay attention to you - or else you'll be waiting 30 min intervals until you see your server again.   Guacamole is decent; good place to watch sports...   :)  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oik, so I drive by this place everyday on my way to work. And see that its pretty packed ALWAYS. Decided to try it out today for the very first time. Met my friend their for lunch and to watch one of the many football games playing. I must say that i LOVE the decor. The sand outside, tables, plates, cabanas which you have to reserve. However, the service TODAY was NOT the best for a first impression. it took me 30mins to get a drank, and 40 mins to be served. I had to get my own menu, cuz home girl didn't come back to the table. The food,, when it DID come was luke warm to cool. Now, i will say, it was alittle busy, but not THAT busy. I was pissed. Buy the time my friend got there. We were ready to order, but could get THAT done until we gr abed one of the other waiter tending to HER table promptly. The menu is pretty standard. Meals range $7 - 15. The drink was good. My friend asked for the mgr and told him we weren't happy about the service nor meal TIME. He promptly took care of our meal. We weren't looking for him to do that though. And said, next time we come in, to ask for him. I'd say.....mmmmm I'll give them a pass this time. I'll probably go again though. Its a pretty cool spot. And my man will LOVE being able to watch his crap ass Giants Play on the big screens"}
{"text":"Negative star for you Sand Bar!!!! HAPPY HOUR IS A RIP OFF!!! Why did I ask my waitress for happy hour deals and when my bill came they were at full price. Also my friend got sick from the food and then we were asked to leave. Just because she had a drink does not justify  that she was drunk. I spoke to the manager to explain my issues he was very rude and disrespectful. I think the only thing he should be managing is the BATHROOMS!!!!! So what if the place had sand outside I think I would have better service in Rocky Point. Not to mention better food. I'm sure they would have been more accommodating. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A NICE PLACE THIS ISNT IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is top knotch!! I took my whole family there and our family that was visiting from California. Great atmosphere and food. Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Dear Sandbar,  I want to thank you for trying to take advantage of your local patrons. I visit often and spend way to much money there and now I think I know why. My buddy and I were there for the Cardinals game where they have drink deals such as vodka/Rockstar for $4 as well as fireball shots for $4 as well... great deal right!!! Well it would be if they were rung in that way. Instead they try to see who pays attention to their bills and ring it in the way to make the most money for them. They would ring in well vodkas (5.50) and a monster for every two vodkas (2.50) and then the shots were $6 each. Now I want to give them the bennifit of the doubt but it happened at both bars... Just a public service reminder to check your bill here. They may start to give our industry a bad name."}
{"text":"A year ago, we checked out The Sandbar for their crawfish taco Mardi Gras special... And they were delicious.  We went back a few times, and there were certainly some other nice tacos on the menu, but they weren't always consistent.  I stopped eating here when, one day, the waiter brought me an extra taco I didn't order (none of the five other people at the table recalled it, either).  I mentioned to him that I only ordered three tacos, and his response was, \"It's OK, they're only $2.\"  Great point, sir: you see, your tip was going to be $2.  I guess it all works out! (Honestly, I would have still tipped had his response been something remotely resembling an apology.)  Seriously, though, that was the first time I was ever expected to pay for something I did not order.  For some reason, we decided to go back again this week to see if they still had the crawfish tacos for Mardi Gras... And they did!  Unfortunately, they were not $2 like the other tacos.  Even worse, they didn't mention that they were actually shrimp tacos with a few pieces of crawfish in them.    Sorry, Sandbar, but this behavior is NOT OK.  If you're going to advertise something as crawfish tacos, it sure as hell had better not be shrimp tacos with a few sparsely placed pieces of crawfish.  I don't want to pay $4 for twelve crawfish (our waitress who neglected to mention that the crawfish tacos are not crawfish tacos did get a tip, but it was the bare minimum for her bad service, which was not just limited to the taco information).  Besides the deceit in regards to the menu items, the service here is consistently bad.  Don't expect to have a drink in front of you for more than 50% of your meal.  Fool me once..."}
{"text":"If your going to charge for a main event but you are showing football instead, it's a rip off go to the casinos or somewhere else guys!"}
{"text":"Went here with the hubbers to try it out.  It wasn't amazing but it was good.  The prices are fair but the food is not traditional Mexican food.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas which came topped with a sweeter/spicier version of enchilada sauce, really it looked like mole.  But it was good.  The hubs got a chicken burrito which was tasty but not as large of a serving as you expect with mexican food.  The atmosphere is great if you're into sports- seems like a great place to get some chips and salsa and watch a game.  We'll probably give it another shot- it just didn't satisfy my Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"This place isn't great, but if you're looking for a chill outdoor spot to hang and throw around a sand bag playing corn hole than this is the spot for you. Nothing super impressive, sub par customer service."}
{"text":"Great outdoor beach atomsphere.  Unfortunately the beer was very warm and soda flat.  Service was good and friendly waitstaff.  The crowd was college all the way to grandparents.  A lot of fake boobs, almost too many....  But overall an ok place and if the beer was cold, I would give this place a 4 star.  Music after 10 was great, old and new hip hop.  I will definitely go back in search of some colder beer.  Oh yeah, plenty of nice HDTV's to watch sports."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends Birthday party last night, the atmosphere was decent, music left something to be desired, but near the end of the night a very concerning event happened. One of the bouncers came up to the group of us and darn near assaulted one of my friends for allegedly \"being inappropriate\", luckily I was able to defuse the situation before the guard could escalate it any further. We promptly left out of fear that something more serious might take place. Needless to say, it made all of us uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for a work happy hour and it was pretty decent.  As someone that's not a huge partier anymore, I would recommend getting there closer to happy hour time but as someone who loves a crowded bar scene, it's a great option for late night as it got packed around 8 p.m.  Typical Mexican food options.  There's an awesome HUGE outdoor section that I'm excited to take advantage of in the non-115 degree weather!  There are private cabanas that you can rent (I think it's $250 to rent them) with a TV and a server.  Service is usually pretty good - plenty of staff on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Came back only for drinks. Got plastered again and harassed some male bar tenders.  It looks like we're back to 4 starts again! Epic win."}
{"text":"Came to the sandbar in North Phoenix / Desert Ridge for Monday Night Football. They have a great special during the game Montejo Draft Beer for $2!  Better then the special on beer was the service particularly Sara the outside bartender!  Extremely profession and had a great personality - not the mention good looking. Thanks!  Really enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to check this place out, since it's in my neighborhood and I like a good Mexican restaurant.   I was pleasantly surprised. Service was good, the pork adobo tacos were delicious, and the chicken fajitas were also very good. I wanted to try the drinks, but my friend and I had stopped in for lunch while running errands. So I'll save that for another review."}
{"text":"Sandbar is one of my favorite places to head out to when I am out with friends. Love the atmosphere and the food there is really good."}
{"text":"Indoor and outdoor seating was plentiful. Even for the high capacity of ppl in the building. Decided to sit outside. Tv's at every angle. Drinks were ok, came during happy hour so it was worth the 5bucks. I ordered the shrimp nachos with mushrooms and it was apparent that I should have just stuck with a quesadilla or something because this plate of chips and cheese was huge with 6 shrimp and 5 mangled mushrooms on top. Sure I won't be back. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Good food , great patio , but the service has been very poor on my 4 visits. I enjoy going there after a hike and have a few tacos and a margarita but it's always spinning the dice on service"}
{"text":"Was out in Arizona for work and came by here with my team out here. It was a very fun vibe with outdoor sweating perfect for watching the World Series. Great happy hour too, $6 appetizers and $3-6 drinks. we had the margaritas, walking taco, bones less wings, quest dip, chips and salsa, some tacos. All was great! I liked the queso dip and boneless wings the best. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix, this was one of my usual places. I would go here several times a week and have never had a bad experience. The staff has always been super friendly and welcoming. I LOVED their frozen strawberry margaritas and got hooked on their chicken caesar salad w/ buffalo chicken.  I've since moved to Boston and still crave their salad. The outside atmosphere is awesome and they always play great music. Added bonus? They always have a really good happy hour. I miss this place so much!"}
{"text":"I went here for a cocktail with my friend. It was a weird environment. My friend and I were definitely jamming more than the DJ was. Also the margarita is not fresh, it's from a tap. I thought taps were only for beers. Like guess I was wrong about that. Maybe I would go back here to try the food but the crowd was weird. It looks like a local watering hole for old people."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the sandbar.  Luck was fresh and delicious.  Like a favorite pair of old shoes, you just cannot throw away.  Familiar and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I almost didn't go here due to the less than stellar reviews. I was visiting from Texas and had finished up at my work event a tad early and wanted an outside venue to just kind of unwind. From the start the waitress was extremely informative of the happy hour special as well as her/locals favorites. I opted for a margarita that I honestly can't remember the name but it was purple and you have a limit of 3. I quickly figured out why there was a limit. We ordered the queso which was flavorful and plentiful. For my main dish I had wings (by this time I wasn't super hungry). I ordered medium and honey jalapeno. Both were cooked perfectly and had a spicy enough sauce. My boss ordered something that was actually a Mexican dish but quite honestly after my two margaritas I was done listening about how much shr enjoyed her meal. :) I think this is a great place to enjoy drinks and appetizers outside and not melt. Ill come back if I return to AZ."}
{"text":"I will never visit this establishment again. We went for my brothers birthday and rented the large cabana. The major problem was our lack of service, and the service we did get was horrible. We were given one waitress for our large party. She might have been able to keep up if she remembered she was a waitress and not a socialite. It would take over a half an hour for her to come get our orders, and once she did, she would take another half hour to deliver them and sometimes she would just straight up forget your order all together. We also noticed we had drinks added to our order that we didn't order. The only time the waitress had a smile was when we were closing our tab and she tried to give her meager attempt at an apology for being a crappy waitress. I am always a big tipper since I worked in the service industry, but this time I just couldn't give her a tip, the service was so horrible that it was the first time in years I gave no tip. But that didn't stop her from getting one. She felt she would add a tip herself. We didn't realize this until we saw our bank statement and she added a $14 tip for herself. We are currently in the process of disputing the charge. Also we found out from several of the other people that went that they double charged anyone who paid cash. They charged the card used to hold the tab and then took the cash they used to actually pay it. My family and friends will never recommend or go to this joke of an establishment ever again!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  Very disappointed!  Will not go back.  Service was bad, music was terrible, the bar area stunk it seemed very dirty.  We walked out before we even ordered anything.  Trashy place!"}
{"text":"Ladies do not Go to this place!  This Bar is under investigation. I hope they catch the two sum bags."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, especially since there's a big fan and misters so sitting outside on the patio is not only tolerable but fun. The Mussels and Baja fish tacos were pretty good, service was good, except that our 2nd mojito was watered down, and the 3rd was all mint no gin. C'mon, why'd you have to go and spoil it? Drinks are way overpriced like everywhere else, especially considering they hold back the alcohol unless you buy their select few on the Happy Hour menu."}
{"text":"This bar is a great neighborhood hangout especially to watch a game and that's exactly what we did tonight. Yea it's loud, busy and crowded in here, but it's a bar...to drink and watch sports at!   We sat at a booth with a couple friends and even brought out baby, placed him in a high chair. I was actually surprised to see quite a few kids here tonight!  The chips and salsa was great...warm chips. The chicken tacos were fresh and my favorite was the strawberry Mojito.  All in all, it's a fun local place to be casual and to meet up friends."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!! This restaurant is morally disgusting. My father bit into his taco and felt a huge crack and pain on his tooth. A pebble of glass was in his food! He notified the waiter and the waiter apologized. My father was informed that if he had any issues with his tooth to let them know and they would take care of it. He went to the dentist and he cracked his tooth completely to the root and needed a full root canal. He contacted the manager to let them know of the dental bills and they have never gotten back to him. it's been well over 10 months now. I'm encouraging my dad to file a report with the corporate office before he takes any other action. For the sake of this business I hope my father has just been dealing with a neglagent manager and this isn't the type of reputation corporate would approve of. My father never threatened to sue and was content with the fact that they were going to cover the damaged but are YET to do so. It's too bad this place chose to not do the honest and right thing. We are all encouraging and hoping that my dad will file a lawsuit against this place. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place but third time is not the charm.  We went Saturday night and the security guard was training a new welcomer and he literally said \"this is how you do it\" when my friends and I came to the front of the line.  He pulled one of my friends out to the side and and started asking him questions.  Then informed us we could not go in because he was intoxicated.  We told the security multiple times that our friend has a lazy eye and just looks like this normally.  They are rediculous.  Dont waste your time for overpriced drinks and a small dance floor."}
{"text":"I\"m reviewing this based on Sunday lunch only since I have not experienced the nightlife here, but it sounds like a pretty happening place on Fri/Sat.  I had lunch here today with a girfriend and thought it would be more crowded in the bar for Sunday football, but it wasn't too packed.  We were hoping to catch up and chat, so the noise level with the music and high def sports made it a little bit challenging, but overall it's a cool atmosphere and has a good vibe.  I ordered the chicken burrito with black beans and rice ($9) and she had the cheese enchiladas with green sauce and rice/beans ($9).  I liked the presentation, both plates were very festive and nicely sized portions.  I ate half of mine and took the rest to go.  It was really good with nice chunks of shredded chicken breast mixed in with a pico de gallo type sauce.  The service was really good, and I'm looking forward to coming back for cocktails :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a loud festive/bar, kind of made me feel like I was back in my party college days, all the way down to skimpily clad waitresses. We ordered the trio appetizer with spicy beans, queso, guac and chips. The beans and queso were great but the guac was very average. It as served with 2 salsas: a very citrusy green and a chipotle red. They were okay, but nothing we would crave.   I ordered an apple, Gorgonzola salad with the prickly pear vinaigrette. The salad was drenched to the point of soggy. It also was served with chicken which I didn't order but the waitress was good about taking it back and removing it from the bill. The couple of bites I attempted to slurp down weren't impressive so I probably would t try it again.   My husband got the beef tacos. Again, they were okay but not great. Service was good, not as regular as a normal restaurant but a step up from service in bars.   Would we come again? Eh....probably not unless someone wanted to meet here. Even then we oils probably order the trio of dips and leave it at that."}
{"text":"As a Scottsdale transplant living in Chandler,  I'm always looking for a \"cool\" and \"hip\" place to go for happy hour.  Normally, the boys pick places like Majerle's and Murphy's Law.  Boorrrring.    Now, I don't really like Sandbar Scottsdale.  Too......\"alternative\", with lots of punk rockers.  But anyway.  We arrived around 4:30pm for happy hour, and there was already a good sized crowd there.  When we sat down with several others, it was clear the waitress was terribly slow with zero personality.  And what's up with the black knee socks with the sculls?  It continued to get busy, and the crowd was the most random group ever.  I saw 21 year olds, parents with children in tow, hot MILF's, and old dorky men straight from Intel.  I'm thinking it's because it's new and everyone wants to check out that cool bar with the real sand and mini pool.  I would have gone with 2 stars, but I threw an extra in because they're new and I will check it out on a Saturday night around 9pm to see if we can weed out some of the randoms and get a fun crowd having a good time!    Who am I kidding?  We just talk amongst ourselves anyway!"}
{"text":"food was pretty good. really liked the atmosphere. for a sunday afternoon with friends, it was really fun. the dj was awesome, playing the best old school songs. also met the manager and he was very friendly. will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is ALWAYS busy, so I continue to go wondering what I am missing that keeps it so packed all the time.  I have lived in Desert Ridge for about 5 years now and I finally gave up.  The food is underwhelming, drinks are expensive, and the staff doesn't really seem to care much because heck, it's always busy.  There are a lot of X-factors that bring people here like DJ's at night, lots of TV's for sports, and unique atmosphere.  As far as food and service go, a 6 pack and Taco Bell drive through would be just as good."}
{"text":"If you're from out of state, don't bother coming here.  I have never been treated at a bar as bad I was treated here.  I sat at the bar while waiting for my friends so I decided to order a drink. I moved to Arizona not too long ago so I have an out of state license. The bartender immediately told me they have to give it to security and have a manager look at it because there's a \"new process\". Fine, I get it, a business has to do what they need to. The security grabs it and walks away and comes back a few minutes later. He give me a look and asks me for the address back home, almost like an interrogation. Then he THROWS the ID back to me and says \"Looks real enough to me\". EXCUSE ME????   Originally, I wasn't expecting amazing service at this place, if I did I'd go to Yard House or any other restaurant that is know for their sit down dining. However, I have never been treated at a restaurant/bar the way I was treated here.  The bartender was nice and apologetic about the whole situation and said the drink would be on her, but I didn't even want it at this point.  If it wasn't for a friend's going away gathering I would have left and stayed away. Never returning."}
{"text":"I figured I would do another review now that the service seemed much better. 8 of us hit taco Tuesday this time. And what fun it was. Drinks were great, food was great, and the waiter was awesome. I had the Ahi tacos, and Baja tacos which honestly are the best around, and at the best prices in comparison to other establishments running taco Tuesday specials.  My drink was great, I had a deep eddies vodka mule. We also had a huge pile of nachos with meat, cheese, salsa and all the fixings.... it was awesome too. The waiter was on point, quick drink refills, checked in on our needs many times....he did great. Service was polar opposite of my last experience. Great job!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by here one Friday before heading to a movie. Unfortunately it was the same night as the UFC fight and they almost didn't let us in until we promised them that we weren't staying for the fight and we'd be outta there before our \"reserved\" table was needed by the person who reserved it.   The service was nice but slow which is funny because they were adamant about the fact that we needed to be out of there before 7.  The drinks were weak which was disappointing. The nachos were delicious though and the dinner selection was pretty good although it's obvious that the main stay of this place is the bar. Overall, it wasn't too bad and we'll probably go back another day when there's not a fight. :)"}
{"text":"If you're the type that hates crowds or obnoxious \"gangsta\" types, don't come here on a Saturday. Typical Arizona strip mall bar that I was at previously on a Thursday and it was great.  Desiree (she said that was her real name) took care of us and  was terrific. Drinks are reasonably priced. I didn't eat here based on previous reviews."}
{"text":"I get dragged here because the hub is a Hawkeye and Sandbar just happens to be the only Iowa bar in the east valley. Saturday morning can be pretty crazy, however don't expect speedy service, or good service for that matter. Not sure what happened this year. Last season the service was much better, the servers were friendly and prompt.   One Saturday I came with the hub and a group of friends. We ordered  2 breakfast burritos off the brunch menu. 20 minutes later, the waitress came by to verify our order (she didn't even put the order in yet!) 40 minutes later we finally got our food. Our drinks took a millennium to get to us as well.   Now I get if a bar or restaurant is busy you will wait more than usual, but communicate that to us. \"Hey we are swamped right now as you can see, I will get your order to you as soon as possible\".  I get when the server has a bad day, we all have them, but it's hard to have a good experience when everyone has on a sour puss.   To be fair, the food we ordered was hot and tasty. Just wish they would -UP-  the customer service a little more.   **ALSO be warned, if you open a tab with a credit card, they put an automatic $50 hold on your account, maybe just bring CASH***"}
{"text":"Decent drink specials, music is good. And they actually have a sand area hence sand bar! Lighting is chill. Overall cool place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Rachel the bartender on the patio bar!!  She was amazing. Even though I'm not in the bar industry.. I have been before.. And now I'm in the retail costumer costumer service.. She has been nothing but a sweet heart. I have never been into doing surveys or reviews but once I got into working for a company where costumer service is all about, made me realize a lot. Got to give girl props.. Cause I know it's hardworking with crazy drunk assholes and girls. (Been there )  good job girl. Your awesome ! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I think if you come here you really have to enjoy the atmosphere because that's all they have going for them. The drinks are weak, I got the prickly pear margarita and it tasted like straight up juice. I told my server and she said that it was mostly juice and I should have known that before I ordered it. Umm no, that's not how it's described on the menu. Also, the carnitas tacos had no flavor and were filled with fat.......yuck. Once again I alerted my server that the carnitas were mostly fat. Again she says that's how they are made. No apology, no attempt to make it right or ask if I'd like anything else. So my first and only impression of this place is; weaker then most drinks, crappy service, and low quality food. So will I be back..........most definitely not."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a friends birthday . He rented out a cabana which was awesome. Our waitress was extremely friendly and hot btw! We never had a empty drink in our hands. There was about 15 in our party but she stayed on top of the drinks which I thought was impressive. Also they have a girl walking around selling cheap shots. This place was a experience that I would suggest you doing at least once. I know I will continue to come here even if I'm not renting a cabana. Very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to grab a little boozy brunch with the wife and stopped in.  We went around 1230 so it wasn't crowded at all.  Sat at the bar and were immediately helped.  Ordered a couple of drinks and got two apps.  Shredded beef nachos and the mini chimis.  The nachos were awesome and actually had the cheese layered in between.  Nothing worse than a pile of dry chips under all the good stuff on top.  Shredded beef was super flavorful and tender.   The mini chimis were also really quite good.  All in all we were there for about 90 minutes and had a perfect time.  Great bar tending staff and friendly people around.  Great day and nice beach bar hangout"}
{"text":"The girls and I really like to go here after work (which happens to be 3pm or so), which means there is always happy hour and there aren't huge crowds. Ive been here on a Sunday, and it's crazy. This is why I love going after work...  Mondays are also a great drink special day, $4 margaritas, but make sure not to go too crazy, or you'll end up taking a cab home...which we have also done... but we always have fun!"}
{"text":"A good friend that I worked with for years was making the move to a new job so a group of us went out to celebrate at the Sandbar in Desert Ridge this past Thursday night.   We all met up around 5pm in time for some happy hour drinks and appetizers. Decent beer selection and your typical Mexican food options. The atmosphere is supposed to make you feel like you're in Mexico on the beach drinkin' with your buddies, and it pretty much delivers. It's a good place to go for a casual relaxed hangs with people after work, but as the late night crowd starts to roll in it becomes more like your typical club with loud music and more tipsy patrons.   Fun place to go on occasion, but the service was mediocre with several people in our party opting to go to the bar to get drinks because our server was absent and slow."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch while waiting for my car to be repaired. I had the Baja Fish Tacos which were a fried mahi-mahi in a Dos Equis batter. Very glad I chose them, fish was lite and flakey and was served with a chipotle tartar sauce.  Only knocks were that the service was a tad bit slow (but given my situation that was okay) and you had to ask for chips and salsa which as anyone knows is an oddity for a Mexican restaurant here in Phoenix. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I love the sandbar but they need to get rid of DJ Area 4 the Friday night DJ. HE SUCKS"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice but for smokers on patio.  Food just okay."}
{"text":"This place is a meat market.  Not a judgement. Just callin' it like I see it."}
{"text":"Sand Bar was pretty pricey but it was a lot of fun. They were playing perfect music to dance to and the drinks were consistently made and tasted well. Can't speak on the food, as we did not go there to eat. But the whole vibe was just what we were looking for, for our night of fun. There wasn't a cover the night we went, and if there was, I would be asking why!? (Just read a previous review) And when you leave, make sure to be ready to say goodbye to the officers standing at the doorway. They must get a LOT of DUI's leaving from this place. Anyway, I will definitely be going there again. Liked the crowd."}
{"text":"Came to this place over the weekend, wasn't too busy but was still enjoyable. Didn't have to fight my way to the bar to get a drink and the bar staff seemed busy yet attentive which is always a good thing in a loud place where yelling doesn't get their attention. I was here for late-night so didn't eat this time but have before. I enjoy coming here and hanging out and would recommend it to anyone that wants to enjoy a night out without regretting it when they look at their bank account the next morning!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Sandbar today. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. Food had great flavors and amazing portions. Ambiance was upbeat, tables cleaned promptly. I was sad to see the sand go. They remodeled so no more sand, but the changes are good overall. I ordered the Nachos and they were giant. Besides, it is rare any restaurants around keep their happy hour thru Saturday, but Sandbar does, and that's pretty cool. So it's all good by me."}
{"text":"Wings and nachos were good but our server was not so great... Overall was good but our server made it mediocre."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, but the service can be a hit or a miss.  Very nice happy hour and weekly specials."}
{"text":"Nice environment and great tacos.  Only problem is it seems like they are always understaffed and you have to wait a while for a drink, but overall good place."}
{"text":"A delightful surprise!  My parents and I went here for dinner a few nights ago. Our expectations weren't very high - we were mainly looking for a quick bite and some drinks.   I loved the interior! It's a fun bar set-up. Almost every table is a high top, and the stools are comfy. Many of the lights are made from liquor bottles. Bottle caps were used to decorate the columns around the bar. Lots of fun accents. Could definitely use some updating, as it's slightly shabby, but it seemed clean and didn't irk germophobe me.   The main dining area opens via garage doors to the large outdoor deck. Word to the wise - bring a jacket If it's chilly out, even if you're planning to sit inside. I didn't love that aspect, but I can see how it adds to the fun party atmosphere.   The food was surprisingly good! I had a burrito, which I enjoyed. The black beans and rice were quite descent, too. 8.5/10 on the food. Good flavor and lots of steak in the burrito.   Service was excellent. Our server was on top of things, and she knew the menu really well."}
{"text":"I love this place! BBQ jalapeño honey chicken wings & Fajitas is my favorite! And also their Margaritas is the best! I love to come here on Saturday, great place for dancing. Great music, awesome DJ!"}
{"text":"Ok Taco Tuesday is amazing $ 2 tacos Nd they're not like street tacos they're big you don't have to order la million of them to get full. Lol are they your freshest um no. Their margaritas are so yummy."}
{"text":"This place is just fun.  I love that it's in Chandler too. I didn't experience the actual \"sand\" as we sat in the back but this place was great. We tried all the margaritas and I was really happy because they don't skimp on the amount of drink and just cover it up with a bunch of ice. We also had some dip when the munchies started kicking in and it was delicious (but I was slightly drunk so I may have eaten anything and loved it). The waiters and waitresses are a little odd, but super nice and seemed genuine.  This is definitely going to be one of my new hangouts."}
{"text":"We were there recently for a bachelorette party and had a fantastic time. We reserved a cabana and our server was awesome and so was security! We will definitely go back again next time we want a place to go and have a great time. All Of our out of town friends had a fantastic time and so did the bride to be. Thanks again for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Not good service.  Charged extra for tortillas with fajitas.  Only 3 come with order.  $1.50 for more.  Thursday afternoon visit ...... Not good service.  Had to ask for bill to pay twice.  Should have walked away without paying.  So sorry because I have been here when this place is great.  Make yourself a bar or a restaurant because you clearly can't do both."}
{"text":"This place seriously sucks. Consistently the worst service I have ever gotten anywhere.       My friend and I sit at the bar. A male bartender is right in front of us cleaning and running the service bar. He does not acknowledge us as we sit for 5 minutes waiting to give our drink order. Two men walk up to the service area (right next to us) and the male bartender takes their order, makes them drinks, and cashes them out! Umm, hello?      Eventually a female bartender walks around and says nothing but \"what can I get you guys\" serves us our beer, and takes my cash. Gone..she was very rude.      We are hungry and have to wait for her to come back on the side were on so we can grab a menu. I have to call her over and ask for menus.     We decided it would be better to sit at a table since we had people joining us. Our friends come and we go to wait at the table to order drinks (by this time our beers are empty too). We wait for 15 minutes before I start to wonder if they have servers, or if the servers come over here. I go up to the bar and ask if there is a server. She says yes and sends her over.      I order the mac and cheese. Late night menu- it says \"mac and cheese, with jalapenos and toasted breadcrumbs.\" I get my small $8 bowl of mac and cheese which had NO jalapenos and NO breadcrumbs. The server said the breadcrumbs were mixed in and that's why I couldnt see them (That was a lie). I didnt notice that there were also NO jalepenos until I actually started eating it. I have never been so disappointed about bar food before! And the server didnt care at all.     From then on we got served drinks in a timely manner, but our dirty dishes stayed on the tiny table the whole night until we requested the check.  There were four of us, who came in at 2 separate times,  and the server had us all on one check! Pain in my ass. You should know that people always want seperate checks when drinking at the bar and keep it seperate from the beginning.    This Is a description of my last visit to sandbar,  but the rest of my visits are just as bad.   The good: (and the only reason I am giving two stars) -$2 dos xx drafts on Tuesdays. - DJ on tuesdays. Impressive. Nice music selection. -Corn hole, if it isnt being hogged all night by the same two people.  -Taco bar outside on weekends.  The bad: -Service -Prices (except dos xx on tues!) -Food  -How am I supposed to dance in sand? -Rude bartenders -Management (because clearly this is all a result of poor management)"}
{"text":"Outside patio and bar is a great atmosphere.   I had the strawberry mojito it was amazing!  They had a happy hour going on for $6 apps we tried the calamari which was delicious and the guacamole which we thought was just ok we're kind of guac snobs though nothing compares to my homemade :).  The rest of the meal was great we shared the chicken burrito and the mexican cobb salad both were delicious!  Definitely huge portions so worth the price!  Vety attentive and friendly wait staff as well which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"I can say that the waitresses they have working are gorgeous but other than that this place is a joke. Amazingly bad music played WAY too loud to eliminate any chance of having a conversation. Food is way overpriced and not stellar by any means. Waitress cashed us out without even asking if we were done. Place seems to be a douchebag magnet. Typical Scottsdale crowd full of $30,000 millionaires."}
{"text":"The only thing I would go here for is the food. And to be honest even that isn't very good.  The staff and so called \"managers\" need to get their act together and learn how to treat customers. I would recommend going to another restaurant like The Yard at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"When you go to a restaurant, you expect that you will be charged properly. I came here with a friend at midnight for the last couple hours of Cinco de mayo. I ordered 2 drinks (one for me and one for my friend). I paid my bill with my card and left a cash tip. Today I check my bank account and see that not only was I charged twice, but I was charged 2 different amounts. Now my account has been blocked and I somehow can't get a hold of the restaurant. They will never again get my patronage. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. Seems like a great place to have drinks and watch the big game, but the food is not quite average. I had carne asada fajitas and was served a large portion of onions and green peppers with literally four rather small pieces of meat. Not worth the money. Go to Sandbar for drinks, but go somewhere else for dinner. I'd recommend Blue Adobe or Spotted Donkey.  There's usually a reason restaurants are on Groupon or Living Social (which I took advantage of), and it's rarely a good one."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service!!!  We walked in and sat down on the patio and had to wave down the waitress several times before she saw us.  There were 3 waitresses gabbing near the bar.  Then after we ordered, it took her forever to come back and take another order.  The happy hour chimichangas were pretty good though.  Atmosphere was cute...outside."}
{"text":"Definitely feel the need to step in and share my experience of this place, because by the looks of it no one who enjoyed themselves wanted to hop on yelp and do so.   I come here all the time, usually for the fun/drinking/laidback//beach atmosphere and regularly have a great time. Everyday they have $3,$4,$5 drink specials (& $2 drinks on Tuesdays) so its easy to have a few drinks without dropping a ton of cash.  Consistently super strong yummy margaritas. Which is definitely one of my favorite things about this place.  I would give service AT LEAST a 90%. On the rare occasion that service here has had a few bumps my server has always made sure we are perfectly content waiting an extra couple minutes for whatever is backed up.    I just don't get how there are so many bad reviews but is consistently packed?"}
{"text":"I am always up at the Sandbar Desert Ridge location, but because I was on the other side of town I figured I'd give the Chandler location a go. Came in for a late dinner and a few drinks with my sister. Dinner was good, no complaints at all. My 2nd drink was definitely too strong which I hate to complain about but my waitress was very nice about bring me a back of sweet and sour instead of switching out the whole drink. The late night crowd was much different than what I am used to up North at Desert Ridge. Not near as packed and not a very diverse crowd. I did have a nice time but I think I am very comfortable at the Desert Ridge location."}
{"text":"Living in Ahwatukee, this spot is just about a 5 minute drive from my apartment so I tend to go there at least once or twice every couple weeks.    The atmosphere is pretty festive and entertaining.  The crowds on Fri and Sat nights tend to get a little too big for my liking, but it can still be a good time.  I prefer to go during the week when its a little more mellow but still enough people to make it lively.    The food isn't traditional mexican by any means, but still not bad.  I really enjoyed the jalapeno mac n cheese.  The drinks are decently priced, the mixed drinks can tend to get a little pricey so I usually stick with beer.  Wish they had drink specials on Fri and Sat nights, but most of their specials are during the week.    Overall, I enjoy this place.  Its close to my home and the atmosphere makes up for the other minor inconveniences.  I've read other negative reviews about the staff, but personally have never run into anything that was too big of a deal.  The proximity and familiarity with the place is why I enjoy it like I do."}
{"text":"Fun to drink at. Food is GROSSSSSSSSSSSS  We had every type of tacos on the menu at our table.  I sampled all of them.  None were good, NONE.  Rather eat at Taco Bell bad.  So yes, I will return to drink, because it's a fun atmosphere! Eat?  Helllllll no."}
{"text":"So, first and foremost I don't think Sandbar is known for their food. Below average Mexican food, served in a fun adult beach setting.  Saturday afternoon at 11 me and Mom stopped for lunch, nice day out, let's go enjoy a outdoor patio.  Mom......breakfast burrito and 5-8 pieces of potatoes on her plate. \"How is it Mom?\"........\"ehh\" was her reply.  ME.....on a protein bing lately.....Turkey burger. Bland......No taste period. I had to douse it with hot sauce to get some type of taste from it. BUT their sweet potato fries were on point, maybe some of the best I've had.  Waitress was great and attentive. A+ for her. I think this place is more the 20 something crowd at night to party. Food is not the specialty here."}
{"text":"Dont cone here to eat, unless you want extremely loud music blaring in your ears.   Not just my opinion, it was consensus all around us.  Waitress relayed to Justin, shift manager, Justin, ignored us and 20 other guests.  We all all leaving. Go to Barios."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and this was my first time eating from their menu, boy was I disappointed. Yes, the atmosphere outside is unique but the menu fails in comparison. Never once have I ordered a salad and had to request extra lettuce, but I can now check that off the list. I ordered the taco salad expecting a standard offering most would get by ordering the same thing at a Mexican restaurant. I asked for no cheese or sour cream as I am lactose intolerant and yet it showed up topped with both. They took it back and brought back a dairy free version for me but I was shocked at what came out. It was basically a large plate of black beans accompanied by three large (but fragile) tortilla chips, topped with average tasting grilled chicken and sprinkled wit shredded lettuce and tomato. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that the taco plate my husband ordered had the same amount of lettuce as an optional topping that my salad did all together. So, I got some stink eyes when I requested a side of lettuce and was brought a plate of more tiny shredded lettuce. Not exactly the salad I was hoping for when I ordered it. To top it off my margarita was watered down and our waitress seemed more concerned with chatting with her friends at the bar than actually checking on us when we needed things, you know like sweeteners for ice tea that had to be requested twice rather than being brought with the drink initially. Needless to say, we weren't thrilled with our experience and doubt we'll be returning unless it's for some large group gathering where we clearly didn't have a say in the venue selection."}
{"text":"I've read other reviews about this place and will agree it is not for everyone's tastes.  The food is slightly above average but you actually get a decent amount of it for the price.  I always prefer to go during happy hour and find the wait staff very friendly and attentive enough.  They can be a little slow during that time due to shift changes and sometimes there is some waitstaff drama (probably because they aren't as busy).  I give them 3 stars because they \"are who I thought they were!\"  If the DJ is annoying or the bartenders aren't talking to you, maybe go during happy hour and you'll get a different vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Service can be hit-or-miss on Friday evenings.. A few friends from work went for a co-workers' birthday and service was outstanding..! We went back for another co-worker's birthday and was about 30-45 minutes in between drink orders.."}
{"text":"This place is not a Mexican Grill--it's a bar that also serves food. It's shines as a nightspot and comes to life on Friday and Saturday. Save your time and money for a little -- or a lot -- of drinking.   Don't go on Thursday nights unless you like terrible \"throwback\" music. It's like random old school hip-hop/rap songs and the DJ always cuts the tracks and odd times.  The drinks here are pricey but they are generous with alcohol. They throw you a bone with $2 street tacos which are insanely delicious.   Outdoor patio is a smoker's delight and is as big as the main restaurant. Two full bars with flat screens surround the bar.   Weekend are fun: it's packed by 10:00PM and people dance in this section of the dining room they push tables out of the way. Yeah...not a club but hey, it works. I've done the Cupid Shuffle many, many times.  During the weekday it's busy but not crowded. Music always comes on around 10:00PM.  And curiously enough there is always a sketchy cab monopoly. It used to be VIP Taxi and now I don't know what it is but it doesn't look good.   Super casual and fun. But it is kind of out of the way and there is no food around that's open besides In & Out.   I think the cover is $10 for guys. Ladies are in free."}
{"text":"I got a cabana for two separate events and the manager was awesome and kept checking on us throughout the night even though it was busy. The drinks are a little high and when it's packed in there it's a little rough to get your drinks if you don't have a cabana but that's minor. The dance floor is cool and the DJ plays some good stuff. Rachel is a bartender and she's pretty dope! The food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, too many people and overpriced. Don't go there for the food either."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour and the food and drinks were affordable. The nachos are huge and we also got calamari and chimis. Service was suspect."}
{"text":"Absolutely the friendliest staff you can imagine! Great food! Hands down exceeded my expectations 100%! The staff are like a big ole family! The server told me he dropped a wing off my plate on accident... (I wouldn't have ever known) they gave me the wings and another order of wings! When the other order was dropped off the new server said, and I quote, \"these are for you we love our customers!\" I was like whoa! Big TV's, friendly staff, customers are nice, food is great, beach like environment.... you can't make this up! It's the biggest \"no brainer in the history of mankind\" repeat after me! Sand Bar! Gotta go finish my cold Stella and delicious chicken wings!! Well deserved 5 Stars.... great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"In short a casual bar and grill with a beach theme and enough TV's to entertain people during sporting events.   The food on the menu is standard middle class Mexican food, from fish tacos to civiches. Most come here for the drinks and order once they are hungry. There is a $5 never ending bucket of chips and salsa.  The outdoor bar is sounded by sand covered floor so don't wear your nice shoes. There a cabanas for the VIP's and a indoors in case the weather turns sour.    If you are looking for the place to be bar (2010) in the West chandler / Tempe / awatukee area this may be it for you as long as you like laid back non pretentious atmospheres."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place was an Iowa bar hangout until recently when we popped in on a Saturday Morning. The game had just started and we got the last table outside(there was nothing open, even a bar stool on the inside). I haven't been here at night but at least during the day it's pretty chill.   They play the game when it's on and not music like other places. The food was actually pretty good. The portions were large which were expected. We tried the bbq ribs which were really good and I had mahi tacos. The boy had carne tacos which were also really good but the bbq ribs were the best.  Overall the service was great - drinks were never empty and the outside bar loaded with TVs was impressive. It's a high contender against out other fav's for weekend football for sure. Definitely a younger crowd but they're old enough to not be d*bags."}
{"text":"Sandbar Mexican Grill hits the mark for a standard suburban bar catering to a specific crowd. I met a high school friend here to drink some beer, watch sports, look at pretty people, and catch up on things. That is the point of this establishment in the Lowe's center on Ray Road near Interstate 10 in Chandler.  The restaurant is rather large with two massive bars dominating the interior and covered patio. Most of the area is partially open to the outside including a corn hole area and contributing to the frat house feel of the place. We chose to sit inside, but it was tough to find a spot quiet enough for conversation. Sandbar is a great place to go when you do not want to talk.  We had some beer and upgraded the chips and salsa to a queso dip. The chips were good, but the salsa was a bit mild for the area. Our queso was also somewhat bland and quickly congealed. The beer was cold and the servers were really nice and helpful, and the environment was nice with lots of happy people enjoying themselves.  Overall, Sandbar hits the target of being a standard bar for current and former frat boys in suburban Chandler. It seems designed for peak party crowds and probably excels at that. Quiet drinks with old friends may not be the best, but we both left with a smile on our face!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely rocking last night! My group and I dressed up to attend the Zombie Carnival and enter the costume contest. We played Sandbar Jenga that was made for GIANTS out of sliced 2x4's, popped some balloons on the dart board to win prizes and received all of our first drinks on the house! This is my 5th time coming here for the night life and I love how this place is totally relaxed and spacious. In that sense I mean, there are always plenty of people to keep a great vibe going all night long, but I don't bump into them every 5 seconds or get drinks spilled on me.  It's a win-win!  I agree the dance floor is super small, but why do you need that? You can dance anywhere!   They always have cheap drink specials $2, $3 and $5 and offer penny drinks between certain times. It's been a while since I tried the food here, but I remember it being good.   I love that the outside is part of the inside... or inside part of the outside and they have an all night taco stand.  Oh and I dropped something on the dark floor, Kelli, one of the managers brought me a flashlight right away. I must say she was wonderful and is quite good looking!"}
{"text":"I never had the food here so this review is based solely on this place as a venue. It's a pretty fun spot to go hang out and have drinks when I don't feel like going to Mill Ave or Old Town. When it first opened up, it would get stupid packed but as time progressed the crowd slowly subsided. There are nights when it still gets pretty packed but still enjoyable. Crowd here is mixed, which I like. It doesn't take very long to get drinks which can be a buzzkill sometimes. Their bar is pretty well stocked and they seem to have most of the things I've asked for. I like to switch things up now and then. There is also a little small dance floor area should your heart (or feet) desire to do so."}
{"text":"We passed by the Sandbar & it looked cool & fun so we decided to stop by for dinner with our family. The previous reviews are right, it's more of a bar than a restaurant. It has a great beach bar atmosphere. It would be a cool place to hang out with friends if you are just going there to have fun & snack a little but if you are going for dinner I will advise you that it is more than just 1 $ in rating. My daughter wanted to get just a taco & it was going to be around $10! I usually get mini chimis from other restaurants so I thought I would try theirs. The mini chimis I get at other places come with 8 mini chimis & a side of jalopeno cream cheese. There was only 4 mini chimis on the plate & the jalopeno cream cheese was inside the chimis & no side. They tasted ok but but we were very dissapointed & won't go back."}
{"text":"The Sandbar is such a great bar to go to. Amazing food and excellent service. The general manager Justin was so nice and made sure our experience was enjoyable. A great place to visit if you are in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite for taco Tuesday and Friday happy hour! Hostess are very pleasant and the severs take time to listen to your order.  Love the margaritas and very well priced."}
{"text":"Ok so it is a bar, right? TV's with sports, right? So it is a sports bar as far as I have been here many times. But today there is the final Copa America soccer match. Many TVs are playing this match up. We came here and many people did but management decided not to play the sound for  this final match up. Half of the TV are playing this match up. Anyways we and some more people left because of their decision. They want to play DJ dance techno music. What!!!! But the food is good. They get 2 stars for not wanting rondo what their patrons or customers want. I guess they are headed to be more corporate. Walked over to Majerle's next door."}
{"text":"I came to Sand Bar for dinner with my boyfriend and his family while we were visiting Phoenix. I love mexican food so any type of mexican restaurant & bar is perfect in my book...well except for Chevys ;)   They were still doing HH deals when we got there so we got our drinks with the HH prices...score! We also had chips & salsa and also chips & guacamole for starters. They gave us two types of salsa - pico de gallo and chile verde - both were pretty good and the chips were crisp. The guacamole was just okay to me, it seemed like it came from a box...disappointing!  For dinner, I ordered the carne asada tacos. I was expecting it to have some cheese and a salsa on top but it was just three tacos with carne asada and some shredded lettuce in the middle...no toppings! I ended up using the salsa that we got with the chips. The tacos were pretty good, not great, and I felt like they were missing something. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food; my boyfriend had the mexican cobb salad which was pretty good! His family also shared the vegetarian fajitas which looked so good...wish I ordered that!  Service was okay - our server checked on us every once in awhile but she did make sure that our water was refilled and asked if we needed drinks every now and then. Our food came out in a timely manner.   Overall, Sand Bar is just okay in my book. Nothing was particularly outstanding but I wouldn't rule out this place next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sandbar is the most lit place in Scottsdale! The tacos and drinks are straight FIRE!  Hottest place in the valley!"}
{"text":"I went here while traveling for work. I love the atmosphere and the bar theme. The staff was pretty good and they played a diverse music type. I was not however a fan of the food. The presentation was nice but the meat in my tacos were very dry.  I think I will keep this place for drinks for now."}
{"text":"We ate off the lunch menu (the portions were big!) & we were there on a day where drinks were half-priced for ladies.   We had a very attentive server and an overall delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch. We had the baja tacos. 3 battered tacos with rice and black beans. The tacos were very good- the flour tortilla seemed home made. Overall, we were fairly impressed with the food. It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually finished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket.... These type of people do not belong as the main bartender - they can definitely ruin your business.  Tacos and 2 ice teas with tip (which honestly she did not deserve) was $40. Next time, I will go to Rubio's..."}
{"text":"Sandbar, I did not want to like you. But your beer list actually pretty good, and the service was excellent. Granted, we were there on a Sunday at 1 p.m. but still, it had a nice atmosphere and the folks were friendly. Thumbs down for the menu, which was way overpriced ($15 for a taco plate?) and the food was \"meh\" at best.    I do drive by this place though at night, and it looks like a hot mess. I would stick to day drinking."}
{"text":"I really liked the sand on the patio making you feel u are on a beach. Happy hour is killer. And the corn hole game is fun. Great tacos."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the Sandbar management and security team. Well working for one of the national apps that delivers food. I was accused of smelling and smoking weed by the staff of the company the runs security. I am appalled by the way that the sandbar has handled the situation. I have tried to contact management many times and it seems the issue isn't important to them. Owner Steve hasn't returned my calls at all to talk about the issue of staff accusing people of smelling like weed. The is horrible customer service and harassment."}
{"text":"Bought one of their vouchers on Amazon what a joke.  Voucher good Monday - Friday  only in fine print.  We didn't know it at the time so we went to have lunch on a Saturday and I showed the waitress the voucher and asked if she needed to see it first and she said no that's ok I don't need it until after your meal, fine, I said ok.  You would think that if a restaurant was selling vouchers on line they would notify their staff about it and the details, but not this place.  Finished our meal and gave the waitress the voucher, she came back a few minutes latter after talking to another waitress and she said she couldn't accept the voucher because it was only good Mon - Fri, I couldn't help but laugh and I looked in the fine print and sure enough she was right.  lol Now what restaurant sells you a voucher and makes it good only Mon-Fri.  I thought since we offered to give the waitress the voucher initially and she didn't take it and at least look at, the least they could have done is accept it and apologize for the confusion, after all it's not like we were asking for a free meal it's something I paid them for already.  I thought about it and decided to give them a call a few days latter and speak to a manager and let him know how I felt about the experience we had in his restaurant.  Low and behold when I called, all I got was a recording and answering machine to leave a message.  I thought to myself how would you even make a reservation here you can't even talk to a live person on the phone lol.   It took them 3 days to call me back.  The atmosphere is your typical bar on the beach.  The menu is very limited and over priced for what they have.  The food is terrible.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Walked up got ID then when we got to the bar to order drinks we got ID again because our dd asked for water.. when we did get our drinks there were mostly water and tasted terrible the bartender was very rude as well as the door man...."}
{"text":"The patio service on 4th of July at the SandBar in Desert Ridge was HORRIBLE! The female server we had was more concerned about serving other patrons who were getting intoxicated versus my husband and I who went into to eat a lunch late. It was literally 10 minutes before we were asked what to drink, gave attitude while we ordered our food. My bottled Corona sat at the counter for a 10 minutes as she walked by it several times and served it to me hot! Her other server antics were terrible like never refilling our waters once and despite all of this we still gave her a decent tip only to be ignored as we walked out. I made sure to tell my coworkers and friends how horrible the service was there and trust me we'll never go there again!!"}
{"text":"Wow, so if you want to eat at a place that advertises Happy Hour specials on 4x4 cards and then charges you full price despite the fact that you are handing the specials card to the waitress, who then supposedly talks to the manager and comes back to the table and said it was a \"printing error\" and you still owe full price, than this, my friend, is the place for you.  My five friends and I came here for happy hour that they had advertised as starting on Feb 12th. They have a DJ spinning some fun tunes, the sun is shinning, and we are drinking and munching away enjoying ourselves thinking we may have found a new HH joint. Our waitress seemed new, as she would have to ask the bartender every once in awhile if the offered the drinks we wanted, but she was really nice and apologetic to us and thus we have no qualms with her. It's the management that would not give us our happy hour prices that were literally laid out in front of us. It's not that we can't afford regular price, but who doesn't love a good happy hour. Poor business strategy. You lost five patrons. Back to Old Town for us!"}
{"text":"We love Sandbar!! So convenient for a fun night out close to home. We always get the queso and margaritas, and I love the Baja tacos. It's a great spot to watch the game, happy hour and dinner. Service is always friendly and everyone is welcoming."}
{"text":"This is a bar that serves food. Do not be fooled into thinking otherwise. We came for lunch and the place wasn't busy at all, that's ok but the food wasn't. If you want to eat Old El Paso taco shells with bland lukewarm filling, uninspired salsa and pay extra for rice and beans then this place is for you. If not, stay home and make a better meal yourself. Didn't have any adult      Bevies so can't comment on those but the service was pleasant. Don't think I will go back, leave it to the happy hour crowd."}
{"text":"Been here several times before and it seems to get slower and slower every time I go.  Maybe it's the staff playing with water guns while at work.  I don't much care getting hit by water and neither did my friend.  You see, this hair of mine takes time to straighten, so I don't appreciate getting it wet. It would also be nice if a server would come around and take an order.  Especially after I have already ordered before.    If my glass is empty, I might want another. I ordered a vodka with sprite and a beer and it came out to $10."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the drinks are great and the service is outstanding even when busy.  What po'd me was the men's room.  They have lotions, colognes, candy, condoms and CIGARS!!!  You know what the women's room has?  NOTHING!!!  WTF!!!  Not even a cheap bottle of lotion.  I get that men have their wallets with them when they go to the bathroom whereas a lot of time women leave their purses at the table so they may not have any money to tip, but really?  Not even a cheap bottle of lotion?  Won't be back but you are always packed so I'm sure you're not concerned."}
{"text":"Probably the best spicy mango margarita ever!!!! Must have! Environment is perfect for happy hour! Happy crowd and always having things going on! Music is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came with a big group of friends and the restaurant was able to accommodate us fairly quickly. For some they wanted breakfast and other half was in mood for lunch. Luckily we were able order both types of meals and everyone was happy. I had the baja fish which was surprisingly tasty. My friend got the oysters and clams and it was such a small portion, noticed when they brought out the plate the rim of the plate had old grease stains. Everyone was enjoying the guacamole and we had plenty of chips being refilled throughout our meal. The bathrooms were super clean. Not to mention plenty of parking. I didn't have any cocktails but there is a bar area to enjoy."}
{"text":"People tend to get really loud and obnoxious and it can get annoying. Also everytime I have been there I have a hard time trying to get a bartender to take my drink order."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Always the food is 'ok', and  service usually subpar, or just plain terrible. Came in tonight with my boyfriend for some nachos and a few drinks and we got Devin as our server. He was fun and attentive and definitely the best service I've EVER had at this place. Even though it's Memorial Day weekend and crazy busy he still made time for us and checked on us frequently without being overbearing. He also really sold me on the clam bake special, I just wasn't that hungry. Looking forward to coming back again and having Devin as our server."}
{"text":"Well, this is an update, and unfortunately things just get worse at Sandbar.  We went on a monday night. I do have to say the service was great. Our waitress was the perfect amount of helpful without overbearing.  Again, I ordered the chicken tacos and they were worse than before. They were far to spicy for me, and really tasted like the chicken tacos from Rubio's. Except Rubio's are better. They have the same toppings, same tortillas and same baja sauce or whatever it is. The only difference is that Sandbar is about 3x more expensive!!  The chips were very greasy and not flavorful. The queso dip was good with it, but once it sat for awhile it was a hard gross blob and impossible to eat  I had one mojito which was good but too sweet, so just had one!  Bummer, Sandbar....Won't be back again"}
{"text":"This is an update to a previous review. The bar manager reached out to me on Facebook for the way we were treated and asked me to come down to speak directly with him. He  apologized profusely for the issues we experienced during that night. We did not receive any discount, however we never ate when we first came. I am not out to collect a discount or throw my weight around to get one. I am here to be honest and forthright. So, I do thank Stephen for taking his time to follow up with me.   ~Fud/Drink~ The food is pretty typical for a non traditional Mexican bar. The appetizers were nothing too special, they did taste good, that I can say. The cheese/salsa dip we ordered as an appetizer was pretty average, until you add the stellar Tomatillo salsa which it came with. They had crawfish/Shrimp taco specials for Mardis Gras, and I was surprised with the freshness of the tacos. They actually tasted good, so I was impressed...It was still gringo-esque food, but i got to hand it to them, the tacos tasted great considering I left full and satisfied. Looking over the menu, you can tell the place is set up for drinking, I mean come on.. its obvious. But if you get a taco plate it will be worth it, I am not sure of the quality of other dishes. If you want traditional and well cooked Mexican, there are so many places to go here in AZ its insane. But you come here to have some tasty Margs, a yummy taco plate or an app with friends. They have a full bar that pumps out a long lineup of drinks, they all sound good, I will have to try that next time. The drinks that came out tasted good, I didn't try any margaritas, I had to drive home.. Next time...  ~Atmosphere/Service~ It is a pretty neat place to hang out after work. Violeta H. is spot on, this place is great for HH and after work. My fiance and I noted that it was just perfect with as far as the noise goes...not too loud, but not too soft. This is a perfect spot to cool down after a long day of work. Atmosphere was just right and I definitely felt better sitting down with a couple drinks in hand. The service was good, our server knew the menu well, and on queue recited all the specials going on that day for Mardis Gras. Our food and drinks came out quickly despite it being a busy Friday night. The service overall was outstanding, and much better than I could have possibly expected for a busy night.  ~Extras/Rating~  First off, the overall experience is worthy of 3.5 stars, but we still do not have that option. To get rated 4 stars overall you have to have insanely good Mexican dishes that feel authentic. That's not the case here. Sandbar has a lot of competition in that department, so they are an average place to eat at. The food prices are also a tad bit high, which drives down the rating. Same for the drink prices, but HH is great and worth a visit. Stephen informed me of the changes they made to security, so we will see if they make a difference. I am confident they will help the customer experience, as they did a good job coming back from the experience I had previously. As of now, Sandbar is A-OK in my book and perfect for an after work relaxer. I would suggest you give them a try before it gets too late out, that's my final tip! Keep the drinks and the yummy tacos coming and I will be happy!"}
{"text":"Place gets packed so watch out even when using your card to buy drinks. I went on a Friday for happy hour and bought myself and a friend a drink and the next day my bank account I was charged $50.00! My bill was only for 12.00.  Another instance my guy friend was wearing a hat and they did not let him in after 10:00 pm because no hats allowed. I looked over into the Patio and their were plenty of guys with hats on.....I'm sure the security guy was discriminating so we left."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm out of words.. I can't express enough what kind of operation they're running there! First I order a drink and give a $100 and get $10 change back on one drink purchase..!! Waitress ignores me in the and acts as if I'm Not there! I had to literally yell out to get her attention and she hands me over my correct change! Then I go to restroom and another bartender spills my drink and they get an attitude about replacing it! Honestly just go there on a busy night and it's chaos! They don't know what they're doing! It's complete pandemonium Management has no control at all!! Just horrible service!!! Never again, good luck!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it was rated so low you just need to know what you are getting. It's a rocky point style taco and beer bar. Great for an afternoon drink. The food is good but not knock your socks off. I come and have an afternoon beer here with some contractor buddies. Severs are all friendly from my experience, maybe slow at times but if you are in for a relaxing beer it's a great place to go. Sea Bass"}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our food. The food was cold. The place has great setting for games and dancing."}
{"text":"Wow We Drove By Not Knowing it was Here Been To One in Scottsdale a Couple Times For HAPPY Hour  But it Closed & We moved to Tempe Great Weekend Specials on Sat Happy Hour From Open to Seven PM & Sundays All Day  Me Love Specials !!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Flavorful margs, and the tacos were great. Friendly service with a smile, and great music, especially when the Michael Jackson remix was playing. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a bite to eat and a cocktail. We sat down and were finally greeted after waiting for about 20 minutes. To follow, we finally got some drinks and chips and salsa. Our server was very aloof throughout the entire experience and blamed it on the table next to us being needy. I get it, I've worked in the service industry but she kept walking past our table to help others who had not been seated as long. At one point, she came to refill my water, took my glass, and never came back with my cup....? Ultimately we had to flag someone else down for to-go boxes and our check. The worst part...we don't even know what our servers name was because she never told us. I'm extremely lenient when it comes to service in restaurants but this was hands down the worst service I've ever received. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"If I could put less than one star, I would.  This place is vindictive and not worth spending any money in.  A month ago, I reported an encounter with a manager that complained of my comments about an employee that was rude and angry.  When I challenged his threat, my response was to walk away from a place where free speech was not allowed,  I wrote to the general manager but never got a reasonable response other than he would look into it.  I left there stating clearly that I would not go back there and wrote a negative review on YELP.   .   A week ago, I was approached on Facebook by an Assistant GM to come in and discuss my complaint.  We could not make it back from our vacation in time to meet with Jake Kloster but went in tonight hoping to meet with him to discuss my previous complaint.  He wasn't there when we got there and the manager on duty came by and said it was nice to see us back since we left.  He said, I hope we can put this behind us.  We had two drinks at the bar and moved to a table along the bar to accomodate my wife and son.    While waiting for them to arrive, the same Bar Manager that previously welcomed us, called me outside and accused me of harassing the help.  We were greeted very warmly by the staff, especially the bartender and server that were objects of my alleged  harassment by the bar manager. He repeated comments I made almost verbatim but comepletely out of context, and suddenly, I felt set up.  They must have been watching me on their TV security because every time I got up someone followed me.   Every time I went to ask the bartender if she complained, I was bumped away from the bar by thugs,.  This is a clear case of harassment and when I finally asked the bartender that was allegedly offended, she said she was uncomfortable,  When I asked her what was said that made her feel uncomfortable, she could not be specific and looked shook up when the bouncer appeared to threaten me. She was shaking and had a chalky face and looked ready to cry, so I decided to just finish our drinks and leave. I walked back to my table and was told if I would not come outside with them, they would throw mw out,  This was clearly a set up from the time we walked in and at no time would they talk to the person I was with to verify fact from fiction.  This was clearly a case of harassment to warn me off,  I am not warned but angry that this cabal of liars and criminals tried to set me up.  This was clearly a case of trying to shake me down.  I will never ever go ther again and I warn anyone  from going there.    I swear that all this is true and the establishment has gone out of there way to target me.  They invited me back just to set me up.  What a Bush League place this place is.  The remark that made the bartender uncomfatble allegedly was when the bar manager pulled down the big screen for the ball game, I mockingly said, I could bring my porn from home and watch it on the big screen. This whole deal was phony and cooked.  There were others in the crowd that made remarks far more suggestive than mine and I vehemently deny anything was ever said that crossed the line.  These are a group of oafish louts that protect for your buddy at any cost, kind of clique.  The place is not somewhere you want to waste good money.  Stay away and go somewhere else where your money is appreciated. Apparently, someone thought my post was funny, so it must be one of the Managers there.  Anyone who feels threatened in a place should recognize the bullies here.  Keep your wives and daughters away from this place.  It is just a matter of time before they are caught, which is probably why they left Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you love coconut shrimp please avoid the Sandbar. Is like eating a donut. There is no shrimp flavor in this sweet sauce shite cake battered, think it may be shrimp proto-meat?  And what is with the sugar sauce?  I do like the black beans. Scotty's fish tacos are okay. A bit dry.    Sorry about the skrimp left-over pic. Just to show what a tragedy.  Sweet beers..no good IPA."}
{"text":"Simply awful! I can't think of a single redeeming thing to share about this place. Visited twice in the past two weeks and will never return. Food is embarrassing - poor quality and doused with salt. Drinks are weak and servers act like they could care less about getting you what you ordered in under 20 minutes. No idea how this place survives! Haven't experienced food and service this dreadful ever!"}
{"text":"Came in on taco Tuesday and, having never been here before, was impressed. The service was great and the tacos were outstanding. I had one tuna, one chicken, and one shrimp and they were all really tasty. I came at 2 in the afternoon so it wasn't crowded but it seems like it could get fun with a crowd. I'll come back one evening before I leave Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh Sandbar I am sooooo confused. Do people come here to eat, drink, or dance?!?!?! It was Saturday night, the line was wrapped around the building which is a joke because you do not want to WAIT to be in this place!!! Security everywhere and cops in the parking lot just waiting for someone to get rowdy. Very welcoming as if the President were here with the Secret Service!?!? I did not want to wait!! Where theres a will, theres a way!! We walked up to the VIP line (Yes theres a VIP line at a \"Mexican Grill\") they let our group right in it helps if your group is no males and cute girls of course ;) No cover for ladies thank god I'd never pay to come here!!  So we get in and head for the bar theres a wait of course!! We get our first round and look for a place to get comfy for the night. We got lucky and found a large dirty table in the corner where we could watch everyone from afar. We also got the cute waitress that didnt know how to clean tables go figure.   Do not try to get on the dance floor here it is the dumbest thing you can do unless you want to feel like a sardine in a can, then by all means dont let me stop you!! The music I must say is ghetto fabulous with all the rap and I can not count how many times I saw the Pussycat Dolls on the screen. Great dancing music if say this were in fact a dance club!?!?   The grill smell I had to endure all night and bring home with me on my clothes does have me curious about the food here so I will return but only during the day when this place is not cluttered with security and is somewhat less amusing to my senses."}
{"text":"We took friends to this location and they loved it! Service was great and the atmosphere was exactly what they were wanting! Sand bar is always a must go to when people visit us!"}
{"text":"Come here once in awhile and the atmosphere is fun but the service is usually subpar and the drinks are never consistent. I specifically asked for my tacos to be gluten free and I can tell you they were not, even though the server claimed they were.  I can tell today by the way I am feeling that they definitely were not.  My first drink was a prickly pear margarita- delicious.  I ordered a 2nd one and it was not the same drink.    I can't tell if the servers are honestly hired on looks alone or if some form of brain cells are required."}
{"text":"Their Ancho Ribs are SOO good.  Thursdays are their ladies day so appetizers & drinks are half off for the ladies all day... who can beat that?  5 dollars for Ancho Ribs.  YESS.  They always have a lot of great craft beers on draft so that makes me happy.  We've watched a couple of games here... I don't know... it doesn't really feel like a place to watch the game.  Maybe because the sound wasn't on?  The crowd is always pretty mixed...  i can't really figure this place out.  I definitely saw a strip of bacon in a bloody mary the last time I was here so that's a definite plus."}
{"text":"Always a fun time with friends over here. The fish tacos taste amazing and the bar has a really good vibe. One of the best places to enjoy the great weather of Arizona."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. There's lots of different types of crowds. Older or younger you'll be in frat boy types. The drinks are good however the food not so great. The management is not that great as well. But the servers themselves are good. I keep coming back because it is local and I do like it I just wish that little things like that would change."}
{"text":"Went in for a craft beer and hamburger. Restaurant was aestetic both in and outside. Variety of Happy hours by day, hour and weekend. Burger was good, wings looked good, appetisers looked good. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday rocks and is certainly worth it!  Good food & drinks!  Coty the manager also is awesome.  Always a great place to hang on Taco Tuesdays!  Caleb Laieski"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a chips and salsa fanatic! This place has the best chips!! I was the chip monster!! Munch, munch, munch...! The drinks were ok. I ordered the Mojito and it was alright. We then stuck to the Pom-Acai Margarita after that. That was way more tastier....  The decor was very beachy...., the sand outside was cool! The actual look of this place was very nice....I definitely would come back but not when its sooo packed.   I have to come back for the chips........!"}
{"text":"Good food, and an artificial Caribbean atmosphere, it can be a lot of fun to eat here.  On hot days they run misters to keep you cool if you sit outside.  Drinks are good.  The bar is generally populated with singles, groups of friends, and its a younger set in general - but some of us 60's types go there.  Its NOT a quiet place, and sometimes you will be near people who are obnoxiously loud.  The staff is awesome, but carefully check your bill as this is a rapidly serviced business - its amazing they can keep the orders straight - and mistakes in the check occur - like getting another partys bill.  There is no place like the Sandbar in the area, and its really nice in the spring as things start warming up a bit.  Many people gather here after work, so its best to attend during off times if you desire a little more relaxed atmosphere.  You can get some Vitamin D while you have a few brews.  There are lots of TV's up and running as the general them is an outdoor sports bar, though there is inside seating which can be quieter."}
{"text":"A nice atmosphere and decent food. The drinks are priced nice and average drinks. It has a nice atmosphere, outside seating and even nice in the summer when they turn the fans on and the water sprays. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! HORRIBLE!!!Came here with my friends at night time and I was asked for ID at the entrance by the door guy. I provided my AZ DL. I was appalled when the bouncer told me that my license was fake because new licenses now say on the top corner that  is not to be used for federal identification!! That you can't use for flying and such. But I'm sure everyone's knows this, with the exception for the bouncer that is supposed to be his main role, to check ID's and be knowledgeable about it.  This Guy took my license away and went to a group a people where everyone was just checking my ID. This is ridiculous. Exposing my personal info to random people!! I'm just blown away by the lack of training of these guys. Even when I asked to speak to their supervisor these processes to tell me that they don't have one manager on duty! Really? Honestly this place was completely empty and it I understand why now. This was my first and last time day or night time!!    If you don't know what you doing then you shouldn't make false accusations in front of other people. Extremely unprofessional, arrogant.   6/11/16 around 1am"}
{"text":"Okay, so I am just a huge fan because of their Thursday Ladies day/night.  That's right, all day, all night  half price appetizers and drinks.  That would be ALL appetizers and ALL drinks!    What a great deal!    The food is okay, but I really liked the pineapple/chipotle margarita.  It was sweet but had a back-end kick.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Visited here Friday on 10/02 for Happy Hour & had Margarita's and Nachos both were Awesome!!!      The Margarita's were a little on the small side but packed with power, the nachos best I ever had.  Would not recommend the Strawberry Mojito, to many mint leaves & flavorless."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at sandbar for the past year or so but after tonight I probably won't be back. I have always had great service and everyone here remembers me and my friends and treat us great but tonight I'm not too sure what happened to the customer service. I get it we had a new bartender and she made several mistakes which I get it happens..she's learning... but for someone who literally comes to sandbar 2 times a week or so, I know the prices. Getting charged 7.50 for a budlight on happy hour is ridiculous. The bartender calls over the manager (TIM) who was EXTREMELY rude. He honestly had no hospitality whatsoever. I ask him about the bud light I ordered on happy hour which should have been 3 bucks but instead of politely explaining, he quickly had an attitude and argues with me \"you ordered a michelada\" lol like what? So you mean to tell me that for the extra tomato juice that's going to cost me 4.50? L. I just want to know who in the world is ok with paying an extra 4.50 for tomato juice. lol ANYWAYS I state exactly that and instead he says that I was \"fortunate\" to not get charged by other employees in the past.. LOL at that point I just didn't think it was worth it and obviously he doesn't know how to manage his team if that's how he's going to end the conversation.. by blaming his staff that they weren't charging me correctly in the past and that I just got lucky? I've been here 30+ times so I must be super lucky I guess considering how many times I have ordered that without getting charged. TIM is a joke of a manager and I'm not too sure how he got his position but there are plenty of people in this world that can do way better at his job than he does. Lol advice to anyone.. go somewhere else :)"}
{"text":"My review is an extremely generous 4 stars. However, let me start off by stating that this review is only about the Saturday night UFC fight night, outdoor bar area (we didn't eat here). I came out here with a gal pal and we were unsure of what to do for the evening. Behold the Sandbar was a spontaneous choice after we drove around for awhile trying to find a Country place that we couldn't locate. Anyways, down to the review! As we arrived we were greeted by staff that were working the door for a cover charge. i thought, well is there a ladies night special-all ladies have a complimentary entrance before 10? WRONG. Apparently this is NOT L.A. and the cover for the evening was $5 and CASH ONLY. Well, who typically carries cash? We were escorted to the ATM machine and it charges $3 per transaction, that is STEEP. I inquired on why they do charge a cover since it's not a club and was relayed it was UFC fight night.   Well, this place was pop'n and slammed with many patrons. The atmosphere totally brought me waaaay back to the Hermosa Pier days, which is totally FUN when you're a young adult! The music they had played was also music that I remember as you call it ol' school. Sandbar is fantastic for people watching and I was fully entertained with a few talents of guys who were on the patio floor breaking it out in a friendly and comical dance off! I had prime viewing too! I also found myself signing to the songs and jamming a bit to the beat. However, I did chicken out when I was asked to join in on the dance battle. Patrons were very friendly. As the night continued and not shortly after our arrival, you can find drinkers that have obviously drank too much and the things I viewed, high class comedy! So although, the cover and ATM service fee was a bummer, the rest of the evening very well made up for that! The bartenders and all female were attentive, quick and friendly. I had a good time and would return for the entertainment reason. I just heard about the nearby businesses at Highstreet, so I am looking forward to checking them out since there's a Country place that has a live band and I believe Blue Martini and Kona Grill is there which I have been wanting to visit and trying trying their passion fruit creme brûlée. Yum.  I would say this environment and business is for someone who is in their 20's and this is solely a \"MEAT MARKET\". Still a fun place when things are limited around the area."}
{"text":"Waitress needs the info about gf. I asked if they offer anything gf, she said 'anything with a gf next to it, I don't even know what gf means, lol\". I told her she should learn what is, its on your menu.i know, that sounded bitchy, I just thought she should better informed. I think that was embarrassing for her to admit that to a customer.  Iced tea was extremely weak.  The chips come in a huge bucket, that was something i have never seen before, was cool.We did not like either of the salsa's, bland.  The sweet potato fries were soggy and limp. I had a burger with no bun, the burger had great flavor. I also had a bloody Mary, that was super hot and i like hot but this was really hot."}
{"text":"Carnitas nachos are amazing and great happy hour deals. Only thing that outside it smells like pee but I stay inside. Outside its a fun atmosphere since they have all sand in the patio"}
{"text":"In my life, I don't think I've ever had worse service or experienced a less friendly environment. My friend and I have been there twice now and both times, we didn't get seated. We had to ask to be seated and when we did the hostesses ignored us. I don't know how else to describe it...  So, we ended up finding a bar table and waited for about a half an hour for a waitress before going to the bar and serving ourselves. After about an hour, a young man helped us out for the rest of our time there. That was the first time.  The second (and final) time we went, we were told we would have to wait 40 mins for a table unless we found a bar table. We found one, then were told we couldn't sit there because some people were on their way to claim it. We sat there dumbfounded for a few minutes, then left. Maybe all of this is excusable if the hostesses and servers were at least polite about it. But to be honest, almost everyone working here is the rudest individual anyone would ever hope to meet. Idk. Unless you are a young man that catches the eye of one of the hostesses, I would recommend avoiding this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path...NOT!!! Down the street from work. Nice night.. good drinks.. nice looking crowd and its Thursday. Casual and enjoyable. I think i like this spot."}
{"text":"while the service we had was good (the girl brought refills quickly and took our order correctly and quickly) and the environment wasn't bad. The patio had a very nice fire pit that was warm and toasty for a cold night.   the food, on the other hand, wasn't much to write home about. the chimichanga was bland (needed salsa to kick it up a bit) and the guac was something i could get in any store ( if it weren't for the chunks of avocado, i would have thought it was a mix made with sour cream and a powder) and the chocolate chimis for dessert weren't that great, even with the cinnamon.   i didn't go during happy hour, so i can't advise you on that, but the drinks my father had seemed to do the trick.   all in all, its just ok. will it feed you decent food, yeah. will the service be good, yeah.  but if you are looking for authentic mexican, don't come here. or if you want spicy food."}
{"text":"I went there with a buddy for some beers and to watch basketball game. I got a beer, but the waitress didn't even mention there was a happy hour. After being served the beer it was 15 minutes before she asked if I wanted food. I ordered the queso and it took 45 minutes to come out. I told the waitress I was over it. It wasn't busy at all and the service was god awful."}
{"text":"Fun and festive place to share a drink and Mexican appetizers.  Good service on the outdoor patio.  Plenty of flat screens to view current sporting events.  They offer different specials each day of the week, such as Taco Tuesday with $2 tacos and $2 draft beers.  We took advantage of the Margarita Monday with $5 margaritas.  My frozen strawberry drink was delicious!  My husband stuck with a draft beer.  He ordered the Chimichanga for lunch which arrived hot and packed with flavor.   I had the $6.99 lunch special, fajitas burrito.  Standard Mexican fare- very filling.    Overall, the fun, party atmosphere overshadows the average food.  But then again, we went there for a good time and not for gourmet dinning!"}
{"text":"Sandbar was by far my favorite place I ate at, on my quick weekend trip in Arizona.  I decided to get  the Ahi Tuna tacos.  The taco shell was actually a Jicama based shell.  It was healthy but delicious! From the environment, to the chips and salsa (amazing) to the food everything was a great surprise! I'm going back!    (However, the noise level is too loud where it's difficult to understand what the person sitting next to you is even saying.)"}
{"text":"I dig on this spot to take in the weather along with the games and other action. The bar staff here treat me like gold and I enjoy the location. Seating is ample both inside or out; I prefer out so that I can soak up the sun and catch the wide array of beautiful women soaking up the sun with me (Sun= hot outfits+Alcohol) Hmmmmm. It doesn't take a Rocket Scientist to equate this. Not in a college let's gets blasted and fall down way, but instead like hanging at the beach all day with your compadres grilling and chilling way.   The bar is located right next to Total Wine; \"So it's in my wheelhouse.\" After a few pops I do a little shopping to see what new adventure I can bring home to the to be shared on Vino2 or Rebel Wine Drinkers.  Also, this is a great football watching spot and as a group you can rent cabanas outside for a $400 minimum spend. Additionally, shopping, movies, coffee and retail encircle the area and there are other great places to throw on the feed bag if you just want cocktails here. Come out and enjoy the weather!  #vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared #irishcatV2"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. I WANT to love this place, but I just can't. The sand surrounding the bar is a total pain in the ass and gets everywhere. At 6:00 on a Wednesday the place is full of cougars (not necessarily a bad thing, but not the young hip crowd I was expecting). The band was great-some ska band, highly talented. The margaritas were amazing (try the prickly pear). Caveats-traffic. LOUD traffic. Server was completely lacking a personality. Some of the worst \"Mexican\" food I have ever had. Excessive cilantro on everything. Cold queso dip appetizer that we sent back, only to get more cold queso dip with disgusting lumps of burned cheese in it. Spanish rice tasted like some \"minute rice\" 50's mom nonsense, and the beans could have been spackle for all the flavor they had. I would go back for a drink or two, and go somewhere (anywhere) else to eat."}
{"text":"You've got to appreciate a bar that has actual sand you can sink your toes into, bringing a little bit of the beach to the Valley.  At the Desert Ridge location of Sand Bar (there are three in the Valley), there's a massive bar in the center of the outdoor patio, along with a ton of umbrella-covered tables atop the sand, as well as a big indoor restaurant.  The bar is full-service and has a slew of televisions, and there are also three more secluded cabanas with ultra-comfy couches and televisions.  This past Sunday, my friend and I were surprised to see no one was sitting at the cabanas, and we got our own private viewing party at one after requesting to sit there.  I've only had the food at Sand Bar once, but it was nothing special and definitely not something I'd crave. I did like the endless bucket of chips ($5) and two types of salsa (the green is my favorite), but I'd stick to that if you want food.  The cheese enchiladas ($8.99) were rubbery and forgettable, and I didn't enjoy the red sauce that covered them. The saving grace of the dish was the rice, but even that didn't stand out.  Instead, go to Sand Bar for an island-y atmosphere and a ton of viewing options. Even though all the TV's at the bar displayed football games, the bartender had no problem turning on the Diamondbacks for us at the cabana, and the service there has always been great for me."}
{"text":"I know most people come here to grab a drink before heading out for the night, I never have so can't comment on that, but I am a big fan of their taco Tuesdays. For $2 a taco they have a great selection that will appeal to anyone. And of course it includes bottomless chips and salsa, you will find me here most Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Number one option in desert ridge for a casual drink.  Sandbar is a good place to go to meet people whether at night or during the day.  Sometimes you have to watch out for some lame people at night but for the most part the clientele is good.  Servers are pretty hospitable.  Though I usually do not eat the food is not bad and they have a decent taco Tuesday deal. Sit out at the patio if you can stand a little smoke."}
{"text":"The drinks are pretty good. But the service and food is mediocre. Our server never brought napkins or silverware to our table and only brought drinks after asking a third time after almost an hour here. The food then had no flavor and was nothing above . Overall,  if you're looking for a tuesday night out,  i would choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Waaaa I am so sad and heartbroken that they left the northern location... like I cried. The food may have not been perfect or.drinks all that.. but the location the happy hour especially the UFC showings what kept me going back. The servers ad bartenders were amazing. I truly miss the Sanbar"}
{"text":"Wait! Taco Tuesday.  $20 for 2 adults, 1 child. 5 total tacos, 1 kids meal, and chips and salsa.....tacos were definitely worth the  $2 per taco. Plus a bucket of chips and salsa. Definitely will return for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"One star only to leave a review. Horrible service!!! If you want to have 2 drinks over a 10hr period this is your place. Horrible horrible horrible service"}
{"text":"The food was okay and the drinks were decent. The reason for the one star is the waiter after only coming to our table THREE times ask why I only tipped him $10 on a $150 check. Tips are something that should be earned not expected. Provide a mediocre service get a mediocre tip."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre but outperforms the service.  Went there for lunch as I tend to forget after a few months how annoyed I was the last time and try them again.  History is kind but perhaps I should write it down....oh, I guess I am.  I cannot comment on its nightlife as I have just gone on weekdays for lunch.  Hopefully, I can remember to not go back.  I did mark that they have waiter service but it is so hit or miss on the level of service that it is questionable.  Maybe it should ask \"effective\" wait service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service can be pretty slow with the cocktail girls, but the atmosphere is like no other bar! Sand in your feet beer in your hand!  Literally!  We went for Halloween and had a great time! But there were some gross creepy crawlers around, and I don't think it was apart of the Halloween decor...anyways definitely a good time!"}
{"text":"This place is okay to have a drink and do a little bit of dancing. The service can be slow sometimes and the food is okay. Overall, it's not a bad place to go to just hang out and be mellow on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great tea and chicken chimi, unfortunately it stopped there.  First of all the seats are horrible and pitch you forward causing you to have to put your feet up on the table rail to push yourself back onto the seat. We got our drinks, ice tea for both of us, very fresh brewed tea. As a matter of fact, some of the best ever. Then the guacamole came out...not bad but nothing great, wouldn't get it again. Next came the entrees. Chicken chimichanga, Spanish rice, guacamole, black beans and lettuce & tomatoes. Let's go down the list. Chicken chimi: excellent. Spanish rice: inedible. Guacamole: had gone bad, why on the same order one is good and one is bad is beyond me. Black beans: under seasoned, didn't eat 'em. Lettuce & tomatoes: didn't even try it, got one piece of lettuce with a bite of chimi and it was sour. Now on to the staff. Our waitress was adequate but the wait staff and bar staff on a whole stood around and talked way too much to each other. One of the cooks did little more than talk on his cell phone while waiting on orders. The girl working with him had to literally yell at him in order to get his attention so that he would work.  I won't be going back. If it weren't for the chimi I would have given 1 star.  Update: The assistant manager contacted me and offered coupons to come back or refund my money. I couldn't bring myself to get the coupons to go back nor could I justify getting my money back because then I would feel obligated to go back. No change to my rating, I just thought it fair to let others know that they do seem to care that they get bad feedback."}
{"text":"Sunday, February 26th, 2014 - PLEASE turn the Jersey Shore disco music down so people can come out, enjoy the AZ winter weather and actually have a conversation without feeling like it's 11pm at the nightclub.  Seriously!!!  We went there to have a few beers with friends outside and had to yell to hear one another.  I am looking around and there are not many people  and I can tell you, this place is losing business because no family is going to want to come here with this music and as for us, we all had a beer, paid the bill and walked over to the outdoor patio at McFaddens around the corner.  The music genere was much more desirable, turned to a normal volume and we could all actually hear one another.  Sandbar, I'm telling your Manager (if they read these reviews) you could be doing a better business in the late afternoon early evening hours if the music level was normal...  We do not intend to return if struggling to be able to hold a conversation is part of the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time last Saturday around 1:00PM. I ordered the Chicken Burrito, which was actually quite good. Good flavor and well put together presentation wise. Service on the other hand was absolutely terrible! Our waitress kept forgetting to check on us and it took forever for refills. Very loud club music was also a negative. If you are going for drinks with your buddies and want to stare at inappropriately clothed women (at least for a lunch hour), then this is your place. If you want family friendly go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Many douche bags and old cougars. At least the night I was there. Drinks were alright and strong. Food was decent. My tab wasn't too bad.  I was wearing my Marine Corps hoodie there on the Marine Corps birthday/veterans day weekend, told I couldn't have the hood on, because it's against policy. Despite it being cold and raining and the propane heater we were next to kept going out. Every waitress was wearing their hoods. Not exactly fair is it?  My wife was cold, she wore my sweater with the hood on. That's ok because she's cute.  A bathroom attendant, only in the men's bathroom. No thanks.  Bought a water to take with me when the night was over. Wasn't allowed to leave with my water. Had to throw it away. Brand new bottle of water with just a sip out of it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Sandbar in Scottsdale. This one in Chandler, seems... Not as service oriented. Last night at happy hour, we waited 20 minutes before the bartender said \"I'll be right with you\". Later, we moved to a table and I waved the waitress over. She said, \"Can I help you with something?\". haha. Almost like she was just going to point to the bar and say, \"you can get your drinks right there.\" But then service got normal. I've been to this Sandbar 4 times now. Foods good, drinks are ok."}
{"text":"We heard this was a happening place so we had to try it. We tried lunch so there wasn't much going on. The food and service were just average."}
{"text":"Rachelle was amazing tonight!  Not my server.  She still took care of my group! Was amazing knowing the tip was going to our server.  We took care of her, she took care of us while our server was paying more attention to her large party.  Go to Sandbar and ask for Rachelle.  Amazing service! Ty Rachelle!!"}
{"text":"I like the idea but not so much the food. I feel like the food they serve here is effortless, so if your just looking for a place to munch and socialize...I guess try it out! I mean they do have music, space is huge!"}
{"text":"Does it feel like a casting party for MTV's game show Next when I come here?  Yes, yes it does.  That said, you have to appreciate this joint for what it is: decent food, reasonable drink prices, and entertaining people watching.  I sat with friends for close to 2.5 hours and after tip my tab was just over $10 - that doesn't suck.  Most of the waitresses are nice, and easy on the eyes - so service is consistently average.  They have a plethora of tvs and there is actually sand on the patio, which I guess is kind of unique.  If you're patio bound, you may have to deal with the smokers, but most of them are considerate enough to not be a bother.  Check this place out some time for happy hour - that's your best bet for having a good time."}
{"text":"Friday night, meting a several friends for a drink. They had a live bad and the weather was great.   That was the good of it.   The server, while nice, was slooow and the drinks were weeeeak. The prices are average, which makes a bad combo.   Once the band stopped and the house music started it pretty much killed the fun.   Was not a fan of the food last time but neglected to eat this time."}
{"text":"Went there to for the late games on NFL Sunday with a group of 4. On a bill that should have been in the 150 range (we each had a few drinks and one order of nachos to split), our waitress charged me a whopping $267. She also had the gall to have gratuity included already on the check, even though I was only with 3 other people. They literally tried to steal money from me, and I will never go to this place again.   I came to find out last night that one of my friends paid his tab on the way out as well. His tab was included on mine.  And as if the stealing money wasn't bad enough, the service was terrible.  On a positive note, the place was a fun place to be. Fun and friendly crowd and a really nice facility. It's a shame they are running a dishonest business, because it's a place I would have started going to for NFL Sundays despite the bad service."}
{"text":"Gucamole is awesome. Happy Hour prices are good and I live the atmosphere. A group of friends went for the Ladies Happy Hour yesterday. One of my friends said \"watch your bill because they often dont charge the Hapoy Hour prices\". Sure enough, everyone at the table had to get their bill adjusted because we were overcharged. It's not for me it was about a 5 dollar difference. Not a lot of money but it's the principle."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. Came for cinco de mayo and it was nothing but a buzz kill. We didn't get waters until the very end, we received food without silverware, and the waiter was nothing but rude. We waited almost 40 minutes before being acknowledged from anyone. Would never recommend this place and super disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays! Yeah!!!  Baja, Carne Asada & more -- for $2 a pop -- oh yeah!  It's probably the only time I'll attend since I can't be hanging with the drunk crowd anymore.  Place was pretty slow for a lunch hour, but I gather it's more for the bar/pick-up/rowdy/sport -- let's dress like hooches place; but I can dig :)  I really enjoyed the hugh panoramic wall mural in the back, think I can sit here for hours having a drink to two (margaritas of course)  Our service was very good.  Nothing like a friendly smile with my tacos - :)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off, crowded bar scenes aren't really my thing so I gotta be fair and put that out there.  Negatives: Drinks were over-priced and not very good tasting.  I had a pomegranite margarita.  Too sweet and cheap tasting.  But I guess that's kinda expected at a white-Mexican place (Before you get all offended, I'm white-Mexican, so calm down hehe). Chips and cheese dip were horrible.  Tasted like chemicals or something and the chips were stale and overly salty.  And since when are there mushrooms in \"queso dip\"?  Weird. I heard this was \"the place to be\", hence standing room only. Not very clean.  On the positive side:   Pretty diverse Okay music from the little I could hear above the general noise of the place Big screens (ESPN) to stare at if you so choose A couple hot bartenders This is \"the place to be\" in the area, so if you really care about that, head on over"}
{"text":"PLEASE READ?  I just experienced the craziest thing. Never will I go to Sandbar Chandler again..Racial profiling is really a thing smh.  So my grandfather & uncle are down here from Virginia to enjoy my grandpas birthday.. so get this we get to sandbar and first they told my grandpa he had to leave his shades in the car , then he proceeded to tell the door man we took Lyft so then he said okay put them in your pocket after the second time of us asking if he could put them in his pocket. They are SUNGLASSES ?? Why can't sunglasses be in hand ?  Second after the guy checks our IDs we go to the next man who is by the girl who takes the cover ( first of all when in the hell did they start charging ? It's a bar/restaurant ....) the next man tell my uncle his jeans are to baggy and he has to go, my uncles jeans were like any other young man out here and they weren't baggy he was just sagging a little... So then my grandpa begins to get upset and they tell him he doesn't meet dress code either because of his bottoms. YALL MY GRANDPA HAD ON A BUTTON UP & SOME NICE SHORTS (not sagging at all) and nice shoes... then some young boys had on the SAME type of jeans my uncle had on & I tell them what happened, they walk up and both get declined to enter because they are sagging !!!! They all were barely sagging and both of them had on belts with there jeans.... so then we all trippin , goin off... THEN a set of white boys with the SAME type of Jeans , both sagging off there butt a little bit go on walk up & they let them right in !!!!!! Also a BLACK older man who was walking out states they gave him a hard time & kept carding him inside...First off since when did sandbar get a strict dress code & when was normal nice casual clothing not aloud? When people of color show up in them ? Oh okay !  This is all coming from a place where you use to be able to just walk right in & have any type of clothing you want on..And any and everyone was welcome...I have never felt sooo disrespected & catch this as we were standing there watching all these ppl go in, literally just watching them let NON COLORED people go in just in shock. The police walk up... They really called the cops on us as if we were all in the wrong... All in all Sandbar lost a loyal customer, will not go back & will be sharing my story every where and they will get nothing but bad ratings from me... WE ARE ALL THE SAME! RACIAL PROFILING IS REALLY REAL... sad..... Everyone pls stay woke & be careful out there! PICTURE SHOWN IS WHAT THEY BOTH WORE LASTNIGHT ( uncle on left & grandpa on the right) #share #sandbar #BLACKLIVESMATTER"}
{"text":"First time going to this establishment and it will be the last. My parents got there at 4pm to reserve a seat for me until I got out of work so we can all watch the big fight going on that day but as soon as I try to get in a \"security personnel\" aka a wanna be cop tells me it's $40 to just get in... I explained my parents already have a seat for me it should be covered. In the rudest way possible he goes what's his name? I tell him he rolls his eyes doesn't look at anything not a clipboard computer and goes mmmmm nope! Ok wow that's a great way to start of the night... I had to get my uncle and dad to come tell this Paul blart we already paid for everything and he was staring us down like we were literally stealing his paycheck. HORRIBLE STAFF! We gave the cashier the $40 so he can settle down but he stared us down the entire way like we just got off scot free... we paid and he STILL had attitude for no reason. He was there at 6:30 working the front. Glad I won't be ever seeing his face again."}
{"text":"Now that it is football season, Sandbar has become my go to bar to watch games. Whether you're sitting inside or outside on the patio, there are dozens of tv's with every game available. Even on hot days, it's comfortable to sit outside as the patio has misters to cool you down.  Special shout out to our waitress, Michelle, who will give you a huge smile and is incredibly friendly! As she says it, smiling is just \"her thing\" and it's awesome. All of the employees are great and they all seem to be having fun, really helping the whole vibe of the place.  Now to the food. Happy hour is from 3pm-7pm every day with a special game day happy hour menu on Sundays. Appetizers are  $6 across the board for the most part and if you want the most bang for your buck, get the quesadilla or nachos. Both are delicious. Just note that adding meat comes with a few extra dollar charge. Drink specials are also available, with Four Peaks drafts at $4 and margaritas for $5. Really can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for happy hour.  Make sure to sit outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere and the service is pretty good. The manager stops by to check on us almost every time we're in. The hostess is usually MIA for 10 minutes or longer and I wish they'd fix that issue...other than that - we love it!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my birthday here this past weekend bad experience we got a cabana the server was no where to be found the first two hours then she complained because she didn't get 25% gratuity. The bouncer wouldn't let my boyfriend back in to get my purse and pay the bill even though he was sober. If you're about to spend 1k on a birthday I suggest you go somewhere else and not here they are very rude."}
{"text":"Went there at 11:00 am on a Saturday, not only did they not have their usual Saturday drink prices but they increased all prices because of the fight that night at 7:00 pm. So the lunch clientele was footing the bill for the fight crowd eight hours later. Hmmm, thanks for the gouge, we had one beer and went to Zipps for lunch. Bartenders were nice as always!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service very slow, even on slow monday afternoon!  Had 4 Cabo Wabo Margaritas & not pleased w the fact that i dont even have a buzz.  $80 bill & no buzz=2 stars.  I mean u shld really kno how to make a descent margarita for a \"sandbar.\".  Ambiance was ok.  Expected more sand.... & shade."}
{"text":"The management at the restaurant is not even worth the 1 star. They're so unorganized and the manager is not helpful whatsoever. The owner needs to fire its management. We spent $150 on food and drinks and 1 hour into the UFC fight they kicked us out because the table was \"reserved\". Wow! They have no respect for their customers. I will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Although service was good, my drink was seriously watered down. To the point of me almost saying, can I just get a rum on the rocks? Seriously. Basically I paid $12 total for two cokes with a splash of rum. It reminded me of hearing Kat Williams say, if your drink is really, really dark like blood, that is because you didn't order vodka buddy so sit your broke A$$ down. I actually paid for some alcohol and got none.. I am not asking you to pour like I am fish, but man, can you add a little bit of spirits to my coke? That would be lovely, thanks!  I wasn't the only one with this issue as another member of our party complained about the exact same thing."}
{"text":"Average food and great atmosphere been going for years but lately the service is horrible.   Last  3 times sat for 20 plus minutes before server showed up and the beer is warm as well.   Not sure what changed but used to love this place now not so much."}
{"text":"Actually, not bad. Unlike MacFadden's (the other dance spot) this place has a disignated dance floor, so you're not fighting your way through drunk people flailing their arms to get to the bar. Drink prices are better than Westgates, Carne Asada tacos for drunk munchies, and a beach-like environment... Good music too."}
{"text":"I have been coming here every Friday to happy hour and listen to  the live band. They always have the tables outside reserved and the place is empty??? WTF? Went there for Cinco de Mayo and paid $5 for cover, went to the outside tables, which were empty and reserved for 2 hours later and we could not sit there? Pissed me off and left and got our money back. Not going back again. What a joke..."}
{"text":"Welcome to Shit Beach. Honestly, my complaints about Sandbar are far too numerous to list without sounding like the one of those people who are never happy. But I AM happy, usually...until I come here. Literally, every time I've been to Sandbar, I've made the kind of promise to myself to never return that I actually intend to keep. I've personally witnessed hyper-aggressive bouncers use criminal levels of violence on non-violent patrons. You won't care about that because you're coming here anyway. You have no choice. Sandbar choke-slammed every other bar in Desert Ridge face-first into a fence and beat them into unconsciousness.   So get ready to rub elbows with assholes, the kind who think that drive WAY out east to Tatum is close enough to be Scottsdale. They have two kinds of music at Sandbar, loud hip-hop and loud \"club\" hip-hop. I'm talking about that kind of experimentation where the DJ has to prove he can mix two songs on top of one another, with some repeating sirens, whistles and air horns to show you he's serious about his craft. If you're over 16, you'll hate it too. But you're going to Sandbar anyway, right?  Where else can drunk teachers and drunker students scream their incomprehensible drink orders at incomprehensible bartenders together? If this were a beach bar in Amity, I'd rather hit the water and take my chances with a certain great white. You can explain that reference to the other 98% of Sandbar's clientele when you get here. They won't get it even if they could hear you.   You could always rent a cabana. That is, if you don't have actual rent or a mortgage to be concerned about. In those, I've been told the \"music\" is even louder. I've been here when it's packed and I've been here when it's empty, but the decibel level is like the blind lady of justice: she ruins it for everyone, equally and harshly.  I'd rather hit Omaha Beach on June 6th, 1944 than Sandbar on any given night.   Not that any of this matters. You'll come here anyway and I will to. My only hope is that we make eye contact at some point, sharing our mutual hatred for this bar of broken glass and cigarette-filled sand."}
{"text":"The music was a way too loud but the food was delicious. We ended up eating in \"silence\" because having a conversation was impossible."}
{"text":"Updated review: I hate to do it but this place lost it's stars for the world's worst server. Okay fine, exaggeration, but she sucked, big time. Feeling blah about this place. I come here about 4 times a month (happy hour is fun, ladies night is a great deal, and I also came after the rugged maniac this year).  Rugged maniac day was a mess= there was some confusion about what time racers would arrive- but whatever they gave us specials and that's that.   Last Tuesday, a friend and I came for Taco Tuesday and I can be patient when places are packed, people are new, etc. It took our server 13 minutes to greet us, whatever I was in good company and we had lots to chat about. She brought us a slightly incorrect order, again not a huge deal but my drink came 6 minutes after my friends- that was weird. We ordered tacos as appetizers, another round of drinks, all took another hour. Finally- we order food and she comes back 24 minutes later (yes I timed it) and says \"Sorry the kitchen is closed\"...hm....as in it just closed or does she mean it's closed now? Took another half out to get our tab.  We were there for exactly 3 hours (from 7:00pm until 8:59pm according to our receipt)...not because we wanted to be there for that long, but because that's out crappy our server was."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars but the fact that they over-charged me drops my review of this place.  Yesterday was my first & last time going here.  I limited myself to having one drink for the whole night as I was a designated driver so tell me how my receipt I signed yesterday has the amount of $13.00 and this morning I have a charge for $50.00.  If you are going to rip me off you best have a gun and a ski mask otherwise it isn't going down like that.  So we'll see what they have to say about over charging me when a call this place later today."}
{"text":"Love reading at the bar area while having a Summer Shandy in summer."}
{"text":"It's a fun place for happy hour and hanging out on a Friday night.  I like that you can get that tacos with jicama.  My buddy loves coming here because of the muscles."}
{"text":"Going to update my review, we go here all the time because it is so close to home and we really don't experience any problems anymore. The atmosphere is fun, it is always pretty busy, and the bartenders and servers are pretty fast and always friendly. The food is average, but it is a great place to go for a drink or two and to people watch."}
{"text":"We are now sitting at Postinos being served because we went to the Sandbar and sat at the bar for five minutes and never got waited on.  A single GUY came in a couple of minutes after we sat down and he got waited on immediately by the FEMALE bartender.  We left.  Hope the Sandbar they are building in Gilbert has better service than the Chandler location.   We love the food and the margaritas,  but not the service."}
{"text":"I hate to love this place. The Happy Hour is bomb, I've had great service, good times... Sometimes it's a weird crowd though."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool concept going, it's an awesome layout and cool beachy vibe. Unfortunately, although the food is okay, the specialty drinks are no bueno-- way too sweet and hardly a hint of tequila... a downer for a place with a separate tequila menu!  The house margarita was a smidge better, but the rrrreeeaally loud music in there (especially for a social bar / restaurant, not a dance party) made for a place I'd recommend skipping entirely."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Sand Bar...it's definitely a college hang out bar with old men who keep looking at the adorable waitress.... A place you go for a first time blind date that you want to get rid of by the end of the night......   We decided to go there on Taco Tuesday..... That was a mess... 45 minute wait for a table or a seat at the bar.  On Tuesday get there before 5 pm....   The taco's were horrible. I had the chicken and the beef both of them taste like dried cardboard. Dry, dry, dry tacos.... I figured on Taco Tuesday they would have gotten the Taco part right....   The drinks on the other hand..... 5 stars for the margarita... It's their signature margarita for $4. It was so good and so strong but not too strong.... Just eat the chips and salsa don't bother ordering food....."}
{"text":"Service was great. Drinks were great. Chips and guacamole was great. Smell was awful! It's 108 outside and more people were on the patio than inside, and it's not because of the giant fans or mister system. The inside bar area has an awful sewer smell that anyone can identity as dry p-traps and/or dirty bar. Please, PLEASE, pour some water down the drains!"}
{"text":"I only like the sandbar bc it's an Iowa Hawkeyes bar. The decor and look of the sandbar is cool. It's a fun place with real sand and tiki bars."}
{"text":"We went dancing there. After 10pm a small section of floor becomes a dance floor. Its rap and hip hop. The crowd was odd, it felt like Hurricane Bay meets Google. A mix of gangsters and software nerds."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Taco Tuesday. My only complaint would be that it wasn't that busy in there but yet the waitress was not very attentive and was some what slow about getting to us. Every time we needed something we had to flag someone down. Other then that the tacos were pretty flavorful and the margaritas were great"}
{"text":"I hope that a manger reads this so they  can address this issue. I don't like the music as much but I like the patio. Anyway, went with a couple of friends and [aid the bill. The waitress comes back and tells me my card was declined. I know there were enough funds because I just transferred funds from one card to the one that was declined. Anyway, I give her another card and it goes through. I then check my mobile app for my bank and it showed that the transaction went through on both cards. When I asked the server to please reverse the charge she basically played it off \"Oh don't worry, it will just roll off\". Well, it didn't roll off and when I stopped but the next day to speak to  a manager, he said the same thing and really did not seem inclined to help. Today, both charges are showing up on my card so they will expecting a visit to take of it which will be the last time I set foot in there. It's insulting to spend money and get no customer service"}
{"text":"Good music, decent food and a good crowd. Rent a cabana in the sand if you can plan in advance."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   Sandbar Mexican Grill has two locations in Phoenix: Chandler Desert Ridge  I recently went to the Desert Ridge location, once on New Years Eve and about a week later.   AMBIANCE   Sandbar epitomizes the breezy beach mentality while still being a local sports bar.   This mixture in vibe can be seen in the decor.  Beach Vibe:  There are full service private cabanas which offer mock \"ocean front views\" with a sand lined beach deck, thatch and tin roof and fun decorative seating and lounge chairs. The whole area is equipped with misters and heaters depending on the weather. There is also a fun fire pit to sit by. (see pics)  Sports Bar:  There is an impressive central bar with 30+ flat screen HDTVs, all on the current games/events.   SERVICE EXPERIENCE   What impressed me most, was both times, as I walked in, there was a super friendly, super cute waitress who immediately asked if I would like to start off with a Sandbar margarita. Honestly, the sweetness and quickness made it hard to do anything but say yes. The first time I had the regular margarita and the second time I had the peach. (see pic) The margarita flavors include, regular, peach, raspberry, and mango. My only complaint is that the lime garnishes on all the drinks were pretty sad looking.   THE MENU  Sandbar has a full bar and impressive drink list as well, although I stuck with the yummy margaritas.   Sandbar also has a full menu of southwest style Mexican food, which looked great, but I only wound up having drinks.   CONCLUSION   I was surprised by the eclectic mix of clientele. There were super trendy 20's, 30's - 40's couples, and singles of all ages. Basically, you can feel comfortable just going in to watch the game, all the way to being dressed up on a date.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Hours: M-F 11am - 2am Sat/Sun 10am - 2am  *Happy Hour: 5 days/week Daily Drink/Food Specials  *Sandbar offers corporate/private events and custom catering for 25 - 750 people.   *For more information: sandbaraz.com"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure why Sandbar has such a low rating. I had been here for drinks and appetizers before but had never eaten here. We had dinner at Sandbar last night and I have to say the service was top rate, the food was good. This is primarily a bar so don't go expecting gourmet. It is pretty basic but still very good for what it is. I had the Baja Taco's which is one of their specialties. I would certainly order them again. I want to go for Taco Tuesday, That sounds like the deal. Friday and Saturday nights the place is more or less a club for the college set. The prices are up there but it is a good place to go for happy hour or dinner and drinks. Even though I rated it a 3 it is a place I would go and recommend just not a place I would pick."}
{"text":"I went to the Sandbar for the first (and last) time last night. I was kicked I for my shoe falling off my foot due to my muscular dystrophy. I had NOT been drinking and was kicked out because of a shoe. Talked to the manager who insisted I had been drinking. They obviously don't care about following ADA rules since I was obviously kicked out for my disability and no other reason. The manager said we should have been talked to (never were.) I left hysterically crying because I felt so violated. Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Tried here when it first opened for happy hour.  We were not happy with the service.  Very crowded with 20-30 y/o group.  Servers had no clue.  We left because it became a chore to get our drinks refreshed. We also sat near the bar and saw at least one drunk argument between boyfriend/girlfriend that resulted in a smashed beer bottle. I don't think it was even 7pm yet.  Came back for Lunch yesterday with my wife and enjoyed the service and food. When you walk in and head to the patio you have a feeling there was a party there the night before.   It was clean, but the feeling was from the broken sun umbrellas, and the decor. After climbing around tables and patio heaters we found a spot in the shade and in the sand.  The bartender was our server and did a great job.  We each had one of their specials and enjoyed it.  Would be happy if this became our weekly lunch spot."}
{"text":"Fun place for a lively night out. Very mixed crowd with all different age groups.  Dance floor is tiny and food is mediocre but staff is very nice and drinks are reasonable. They also have a decent happy hour menu. Last time we went on a Saturday and received a free bottle of bubbly (see photos). Overall pretty fun, just make sure to wear proper shoes :)"}
{"text":"Was here for drinks on a Saturday night.  They had a live band.  OMG, it is was loud and they were so not GOOD.  No wonder why people were sitting outside of the bar in the cold and without bartender service.  After our first and last drinks, we went home."}
{"text":"Just left there tonight... usually love this place. My friend and i started by sitting at the bar and grabbing two drinks. Then our 2 other friends showed up so we decided to sit at a table. After being served another 4 drinks by our new waitress (over a period of another 2 or so hours) we were wondering why we werent being served. Once getting our special lady's attention she informed us our bartender (our original server) explained to us we needed to go to the bar. My ? was why now after this girl has been serving not only us but our new guest for the passed two hours. He felt entitled to our tips... Well he received nothing especially after the outside bar manager was also extremely rude. Needless to say I paid my tab, paid my waitress who was friendly and worked very hard and went to leave the place.  Walking out the door the outside bar manager waved sarcastically to me I said \"Goodbye have a great night!\".. I will never go back even though its a mile up the road. Great injustice to the sweet waitresses, maybe they should manage. They had better customer service than the supposed manager :("}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch a game. We got the queso and it was good. I had the coconut shrimp which was over priced considering you only get the shrimp with the dish and the coconut ended up being burned. Needless to say it wasn't good. I recommend coming to watch a game, have a decent drink and maybe an appetizer. Wouldn't come if you're hungry for a meal."}
{"text":"I've only had margaritas and appetizers here, but I think this place is great!  Fun, outdoor patio complete with sand, a pool, and cabanas.  First time there we sat outside.  Second time we went there because we wanted to sit outside, but the patio was closed for a private party.  Bummer.  Was nice inside too though.  Third time we went at night with friends and I couldn't believe how crowded it was!  It's definitely a party place.  Our waitress that night was great!  Never kept us waiting, despite how crazy it was in there.  Margaritas are good.  Chips and salsa are good too....even though they charge for them.  The red salsa has a kind of strange taste, but the green is fabulous!  Guac is decent....nothing special though.  Overall, this is a fun place to hang out and have a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Service is always terrible! To get waited on takes close to 10 minutes.  No refills on soda because they never return. The food is decent."}
{"text":"I hadn't here for a while so it was nice to come back. A few days ago I was a plus 1 for a company mix and mingle. They had half of the outside reserved for us. (There was another mingle going on outside too. ) The service was still good. Drinks were brought to us right away. The food table was always being changed out. Even though it was busy the staff was working hard. It did not go unnoticed. Loved the little  rolled tacos. I ate 4!!!  Cool music and a fun atmosphere. The sand and cabanas outside make the vibe even better."}
{"text":"Been here twice and we love it here!   Server were very attentive. First time we went there was at night it was busy but they managed it well got our orders and it was correct and taste good.  Yesterday we went there on happy hour.  Less people and I noticed how nice the place is. It is luke you are in Mexico hehehe . Service was awesome and the food and drink was great!  Yes we will comeback again and again!"}
{"text":"The service and food alone would warrant a 4, but the music was loud loud and awful, I couldn't wait to get out of there and not return.  My 15 year old hated the music too.  But really, why play music at 5:30 maxed out????  To make it worse, the DJ, would add thumps to the music, thinking he was Ringo or something.  Horrible for dining out."}
{"text":"What could be better than an ice-cold beer and some Mexican food for lunch or dinner? LOL Very friendly staff, Great Happy hour specials and Beautiful crowd of friendly people. Very BIG patio and the Bar does have a lil something for everyone. Earlier in the night there is a more mature crowd, later after 11pm it gets a bit younger.     This is the spot to watch games...doesn't matter if you are inside or outside - TV's are everywhere. Happy Hour runs from 3pm - 7pm. Full Brunch menu with Mimosa and Bloody Mary specials on Saturday and Sunday 11am - 3pm  4 STARS because of the Great food I had fajitas served in a hot skillet with sautéed onions and peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese blend, sour cream, guacamole & tortillas. The drinks and food are reasonably priced. Tables were also very clean.  I took a star away because after 10pm the volume of the music changes and gets super loud for really no reason, I mean the volume before was perfect. The music was great music and very upbeat I loved the music and vibe  Can't wait to return and try more items from the menu. The Customer Service again is OUTSTANDING and very ATTENTIVE!!!  You know what I'm adding my star back - you get a star - you get a star - you get a star - you get a star and you get a star :)"}
{"text":"Had an awful experience tonight with friends. Bartenders were un inviting margaritas weren't as expected. Experience eas sub par.."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for late night festivities on Fri/Sat nights. It's the new place to be in Chandler so it's still pretty packed after 9-10pm.   I think it's pretty lame they charge a cover for guys after 10pm and they do have a sign up about a dress code, I've never been with anyone that's had a problem so I'm not sure what they won't allow. I know some of the girls I've seen there are dressed like h00kers, so maybe they just do the general no baggy pants for the fellas? Ha.   After 10 they clear out the tables inside and have dancing. Pretty good music, sometimes its a weird mix and you are scratching your head on how to dance to the next song but still fun. Lots of old school fun songs to sing along to and just have fun. The dance floor doesn't seem to get to packed, not dead by any means - you have room to move around.   Its very diverse, I still think everyone wants to check it out. Age range 21-50, seriously :) Some of the people in there are a little too Scottsdale for Chandler, no offense to those Scottsdale-ites. But seriously, you are at a bar that has a sand floor outside, 6 inch heels may have not been the best choice of footwear.   It's hit and miss with the bar service, at the bar can take awhile to get a drink, but that's going to happen anywhere. I do want to give major props to Katie, our server the other night for taking care of our table. She was awesome and I was never empty handed."}
{"text":"I'm here commenting on the nightlife, not so much the food or dinner hours.  Taco Tuesday is a blast, and the prices are awesome! Place is always packed wall to wall on the weekends!  Sit with Mariah or Michelle! They're two excellent servers!"}
{"text":"Let me first start out by commending the staff at this place; from the hostess, wait staff, bartenders and management it's clear their staff is a cut above the rest. Personable service with a smile, great atmosphere, awesome cocktails and good food. (Especially the taco cart late night weekends!) I've have the pleasure of planning many group events there with the GM Justin Jereb. Always accommodating my every need to ensure we have a great experience. With that said we plan on returning for many sports games, UFC Fights and birthday celebrations! If you're looking for a relaxed place to enjoy a night out or a casual happy hour on the patio, this is your place and JUSTIN is your man!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment for 5+ years and have never had worse service than this evening.  They took out an area that used to be a cabana and when it came it to getting drinks and/or food no one could help us.  It either wasn't \"their section\" or they would \"send someone over\".  Neither of which happened from 8pm-11:25pm.  However, when the gentleman who cooked tacos arrived and the security guard quickly told me I was in his space and I needed to move without asking any of my concerns.   Now mind you I have been going to this bar with 5+ years of service (which wasn't always the greatest) but I bit my tongue.   This place has gone down hill more than any place I've ever seen and have zero respect for their patrons.   It truly should be shut down to make the appropriate upgrades (I.e the grill, the bar lines, and the staff).   I truly think this establishment cares more about the status of its employees rather than making money from its loyal patrons."}
{"text":"Sandbar in Desert Ridge is a great bar / restaurant in Scottsdale. They have a good variety of drinks, their food is delicious, and their service is really top notch.   Try their chicken / steak burritos and barbecue burger.  Burger lovers will love the tastiness and freshness of the meat and the optional potato wedges.  Drinks are pretty well priced for a Scottsdale establishment. The bartenders are also pretty well versed in making exotic and rare drinks."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! $2 tacos and beer on Tuesdays, perfect cheap date spot! Can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"The security guards think they're big bad boys.. They escorted me out to the car after dancing with a few females and said I was being \"rowdy\". All I was doing was having fun with my girlfriend and her friends and they decided I \"I had to leave\". This place is Horrible for normal people. Stay away."}
{"text":"Cool Place to relax and have a drink.  Beach atmosphere and good music."}
{"text":"Sandbar was just an overall disappointing dining experience.  I usually don't complain about the long wait.  In this case, 45 minutes.  However, it was the reason for the long wait.  You see, in my party, we have someone in a wheelchair.  Apparently, all the \"handicapped-friendly\" tables were in the back where it was occupied for a private party.  You mean, you rather have all the handicapped people in the back...hidden away?!?!?!  A wise manager would have had those tables scattered throughout the restaurant.  And the manager did feel bad.  Offered us a nearby corner table with steps to get there.  Oh Lord!  Do people not think?!?!?!  Like those people who offer menus in Braille to Deaf people.  Hell-o!  Finally, we get there!  Awesome...an interactive table!  You could check out the menus, play games, and even check Facebook on there.  Except...it didn't work.  What's the point?!?!?!  Chips and salsa were bland.  It was \"$2 a Taco Night\".  Uhm...sometimes simple is best.  These tacos tried to overwhelm you with so many different ingridents and they just turn out to be a mess.  Stick with simplicity, honey.  The only cool thing about this place was this huge overhang light that was covered with Dos Equus bottles."}
{"text":"Wow! What an experience. I walked in here and wasn't sure if it was a bar or restaurant. The two girls up front Rachel and Taylor were awesome. They sat us right away and put us by the tv we wanted to be by for the game. Our server was Super busy and Rachel brought us water and got our drink order so we were settled . Food was great and drinks were as well. I will definitely come back. When we walked out Taylor ran out our Togo box! She some how even caught that."}
{"text":"Cool freaking out door club / bar , do was on point during the night,  girls flowed like sea of Capistrano , i got nice at the bar , now I'm drunk looking take home a big girl lol # beergoggles"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever received, which is surprising given the incredible number of humans walking around that really appear to work here despite the glazed over looks in their eyes and lack of any kind of attempt to offer service.  I sat at a table with an empty drink gor 30 minutes and nobody ever game over to see how we were doing.  The young cocktail waitresses are just walking around slowly, taking breaks to chat with one another... not making any eye contact and having no sense of urgency.  I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Last time I went to sand bar was about a year ago and had such a good time.  I remember they had some really good carne asada tacos...so went there Last night craving their tacos.  Not sure if they were short on meat but the amount of meat I expected on one taco was split between 3 and filled with fillers like thick jalapeno slices...very disappointing for $14!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience and service! If you order food during happy hour, check the pricing! The waitress wouldn't correct her mistake and kept on giving excuses. Not cool...."}
{"text":"Decent food but small tacos.  Got the combination tacos and substituted an Ahi taco-maybe half the size of the others.  Also had the Baja taco and fish taco.  Went there on a Saturday expecting happy hour specials, no happy hour on Saturday.  Chips and two kinds of salsa.  Have to ask for them-but free. Overall just ok."}
{"text":"I went there with my bestie to meet a friend of mine (and his co-worker) from way back when in college. The four of us sat on the patio at a surfboard table chatting it up, eating appetizers and listening to tunes.   What's not to like? I love the beach, beach atmosphere and sand under my feet, so the Sandbar is the next best thing."}
{"text":"I was here late on a Friday night as DD for 4 single friends.   The staff was attentive. {needle rips across record} Let's not talk about that irrelevant stuff... Food and service are after thoughts here. Perhaps it's not this way on other nights, but the Sandbar was pure hookup joint while I was there. Target M-effin Rich baby, beyond anything I have ever experienced. If you are single and looking, suit up and head over. But you better be prepared. Folks were leaving 2-by-2, like there was an Ark in the parking lot.  I was just shaking my head the whole time. Happily married, alcohol-dry... this was not my element fo sho.  From a purely sociological point of view, the Earth could have been repopulated from this restaurant alone, and in short order. Holy Moley! There was something or someone for everyone.  Entrepreneurial ideas were rampant in my head. How much money could I make if I park an Airstream RV in the parking lot, and rent it 30 minutes at a time. Can I partition the RV 3 or 4 times to maximize the transactions per hour? How many personnel do I need for rapid turnover and quality/hygiene? What're the sheet, bleach, and Lysol consumption rates? Maybe I rent 25 minutes at a time. It's amazing that beautiful woman can't pry her eyes from that guy's crotch. What planet am I on? No, thank you, I'm with these knuckleheads.  Truly, these are the crazy things that run through a married man's head in a situation such as this. Was there food? Sure. They were grilling carne and pollo asado and it smelled damn good but my baby sitting responsibilities did not afford me the opportunity to try it.    Don't believe me? Check it out."}
{"text":"So a shot girl was waking around and approached a group of 30 somethings, and one of the guys said \"come back 10 years ago.\" That summed up my impression of this place - it would have been a good hangout 10 years ago. So if you're an early 20 something, go for it! Lots of guys on the prowl.  We sat outside at the surfboard shaped tables - FYI, surf boards don't make the best tables. Nothing fit.  The food was a mixed bag We went with several apps. The queso dip was a HUGE portion, and was pretty good (I'm not a huge fan of queso dip so take it or leave it). The coconut shrimp had an interesting strawberry dip that was decent, but the shrimp themselves were overcooked. Skip the mini chimichangas. Overcooked and not tasty.  A foursquare tip mentioned that the DJ sucks. I wasn't sure what they meant until we sat down and were assaulted by pretty bad club music.   I swear I'm not as old and grumpy as this review is making me out to be."}
{"text":"One day they will get a better management staff that aren't assholes. Worked there 9 months and never have seen a poorly run place. Like the time the managers decided to play a joke on me by asking to help clean up their office and getting a box of business cards dumped on your head while helping them out. Tacos are good tho..."}
{"text":"When we're looking for fish tacos this is the place.  The Ahi tacos with jicama 'tortillas' are the best!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid 3 stars simply because its all over the place and I can't choose between love it and hate it.  Been here as a club- mostly love. Fun, very relaxed, good times.   As a restaurant- oh boy. Used to come for $1 tacos on sundays to watch football, had a blast!  Knew a particular server so service was attentive. Then I went one day.. food tasted different. Went again- food not so good and higher prices? Not a good sign. Went last night to sit and watch the Cards get their ass beat (I'm a fan, but cmon.. this year its been handed to us) Ok- hot bartender. Stiff drink. Fries. Lots and lots of screens to watch us lose on. These were the positives.  Druunnnkk guy hitting on me @ 7 and us losing the game (not Sandbars fault). A new sandwich that had: terrible bread falling apart, beans, lettuce, tomato, onion, pineapple, avocado, queso fresca, chicken, ham, and some sauce. Wow. Dear God, refine this sandwich before it makes its way onto the menu. Way too much going on. These were the negatives.  The couple ever so quietly getting it on in the bathroom so it actually took me a few moments to realize what was happening? Undecided. Not gonna lie, it kept a smile on my face for awhile.  Ill be back, I like the atmosphere. Ill just try not to be hungry"}
{"text":"Food is fair to \"OK\" but that's not why you come here. It's filled with TV's and music, sorta of like a wild college restaurant in Mexico, Spring Break vibe."}
{"text":"After how I was treated last night I will never go back!! Do to security (the actual security manager) I had issues with a guy there who's friends cornered me and said you have issues with him know your place bitch! Security being so quick on there feet came rushing over!  I told them what happened they threw me out instead of the problem(s) and tried to throw out everyone I talked to/knew as well I guess they support violence towards women?!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, really?   Order shots from the girl with the test tube shots but they charge for four extra?  Only correct after I do the math for her?   Really? You are selling drinks for 3 bucks each . You don't know what they cost?   Fun outside area... with sand!  Fun bar to watch the game at."}
{"text":"It's a cute bar in an area of very limited options so I get why people come here, but damn the service here is awful. We came here on a Saturday night to hang out and drink, and were met with a series of cold and curt bartenders. They served water-downed drinks and never said more than two words to us. It sucks when that happens, but I understand sometimes they can't control the amount of alcohol in a drink or they're busy so they don't have time to talk; however, the bartenders here felt more impersonable than any other bartenders I've ever come into contact with.   That experience alone would make me give them a three star rating, but what makes me want to give it a zero star rating was due to a transphobic comment made by their bouncer.   At the entrance they were charging a cover for men, which I asked is that only for male-bodied people? The bouncer just looked at me, and I asked, what about those who don't identify as male, do they have to pay cover? He rolled his eyes and laughed. He said no those kinds of people would have to pay double. I understand he was joking, but I'm bummed that he thought that was an ok thing to joke about. I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bought a client giftcard from the website, it was never received, called back. Talked with the manager who said it was mailed to the billing address even though I specified the address. I never received it at my billing address. At that point they said I will cancel that one and send a new one out to the correct address. well here we are 3 weeks in. No gift card still. So I call back today only to be told the manager is too busy to talk to me. Guess they got my money why would they need to deal with a customer service issue? SMH."}
{"text":"Fun spot, okay service, good salsa and guacamole and cool mist spray system that brings the temp down a bit.  The night we came by, there was a live band playing all the hits from \"shut up and dance\" to 90's hip hop.  Cool vibe, kinda loud (old man) but still an okay place to chill out and munch on some apps, drink cold beer and listen to live music."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere,  good music and happy hour.  Service not so good. Bartenders slack in customer service. Messy bathrooms with no toilet paper."}
{"text":"As I arrived, I asked the Hostess if the patio was open seating, she acknowledged it was and we preceeded to choose a table in the right corner of the patio next to their water display.  After ten minutes had passed, a member of my party attempted to signal the waiter, as he was seemingly scanning the patio.  After fifteen minutes of waiting we left our table and exited the establishment without so much as a goodbye.  I called the location to inform them of my lack of service and after being on hold or ten minutes, I spoke with Gabe (Manager) who offered to \"assist\" me the next time I returned, if I identified myself to him.  I instead chose to patronize a tried and true establishment in Chandler known as CK's.  In my fifteen minute patio experience at CK''s I was greeted, my drinks were served, and my appetizer and two entrees all arived in less than fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"I went in with my husband and our servers name was Rachel. She was very upbeat and attentive, someone I would defienetly recommend to others. We ordered frozen margaritas I got the strawberry (very good) and  he got the house margarita  (kinda strong),. We started our meal with the queso dip (very good) and ended with ahi tacos (jimica  shells were a nice touch)  Would go again and recommend to my friends"}
{"text":"Whoa, I'm not sure where to start with this review but I'd like to preface that I rarely give 1 star to any business.   My family decided to stop here for lunch after shopping at the local stores. This included 2 adults, a teen and a toddler.  Place was dead on a Saturday at noon. Weird, but ok. Perhaps I should have taken that as a sign.   Sat down in a booth. The booth next to us was attracting flies because no one had apparently bussed the table for quite a few hours. Food was crusting on the plates.  Margarita that I ordered was so watered down and in a dirty glass (I now have a sore throat). Ordered queso as an app and it was cold and unbelievably flavorless. Chips were cold and stale. Inedible.  My toddler was playing in the booth and I noticed her hands were dirty. Looked at back of booth(s) and they were covered in dust. I'm assuming that servers aren't asked to do closing duties when checking out. Basically the place was really dirty. Including utensils and plates.   Took 45 minutes, yes you read that right, 45 minutes to get a kids burger and 2 orders of enchiladas.  Waitress checked on us ONCE throughout the meal. Once!  The food tasted like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for 45 minutes. I took one bite and was done. Inedible. Seriously.   Took another 30 minutes to get check. By this time my toddler was screaming and ready to go. So was I! I wish I could have screamed! They were dead. Why the delay in service and food?!  I was so looking forward to some yummy Mexican food and left the restaurant completely grossed out with possibly some funk.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating here. I ordered the jalapeno burger with chorizo and the \"burger\" was the size of a dollar pancake. It was literally two thin, way over cooked patties with dark, way too caramelized japs and onion. Yuk. A lot of twenty somethings filed up the bar, so apparently it's a good place to drink. Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"Slow service!! Food's not great. dance scene warms up after 10."}
{"text":"Really fun place to go on a Friday night.  I am originally from the Midwest and this place reminds me of the party bars back home.  Not the pretentious, douchey bottle service crowd, but just people having a few drinks and a good time.  Why is it that everywhere in the valley with a dance floor has to be pretentious and douchey anyways?  The bar has a cool set up with sand outside to give it a beach type of feel, so be careful if you have on white shoes with that.  I have had issues with the waitresses her in the past not being willing to switch a tab over and making me cash out at the bar or just being uppity in general, but it was never enough to ruin my night.  The other issue is with the music when I have gone.  The Djs there don't really seem to be fluid in their mixes and can really kill the vibe clearing out the dance floor quickly.  I don't want to accuse anyone of anything, but the mixes sound bottled almost like they were arranged before the night started and I think a better DJ could keep the floor packed and just make for a better overall time."}
{"text":"Rachel is ANAZING!!! This girl goes above and beyond!!! She helped our table while our waitress was assisting a busy table and she was phenomenal!!! Thank you so much!!! We love you!!!!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in desert ridge. Do not debate me! The margaritas for $6? I had 5  I was so tipsy I had to uber home. No drinking and driving for me. I also think I might have gotten married to a wonderful woman and three other men that day lol.. (jk) seriously though, this place is fun! The vibes are dope, the crowd is vey mixed.  The bartenders are really nice and accommodating. I didn't even plan on coming here but did after being treating horribly at el barrio ... oh yeah, the chimi's, the coconut shrimp, the nachos... the everything tastes amazing at sandbar. Great place for friends dates not dates.. meeting new people and good drinks."}
{"text":"Can I live here?? Sat on the patio for happy hour and I felt like I was on vacation in Mexico! I ordered an amazingly refreshing frozen margarita and some chips & salsa. WOW, the ambiance outside, the weather, the music, the service, 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"It is Mac n Cheese day on YELP so I am throwing in MY favorite EVER!! Sandbar has the hands-down-best mac n cheese!! They have a white cheddar jalepeno that I actually CRAVE on occassions!! I will be at work and that is all I can think about!! The atmosphere is good there, the staff is amazing and friendly and with an outside patio it all rocks! :)  I get the mac n cheese quite often just as take out because of my rediculas cravings for it!! Try it! You will NOT be disappointed!! Thx to all who reviewed their fav...I may branch out a bit...um...probably not because this mac is my serious addiction problem!! My Mac N Cheese Day Review for your dining enjoyment..crap...now I have to go get some!! :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Creeper central.  Seriously don't go there when its crowded unless you are OK with getting groped repeatedly.  You couldn't pay me to go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my friend and I had been looking forward to trying the sandbar grill. We went there with the hopes of having fajitas and a margarita.  We arrived to find ridiculously loud music on an outdoor patio area filled with smokers and less attentive servers. Maybe we should have tried to sit inside, but we wanted to be outside in the sun. The $16.00 fajitas were way overpriced for the size you receive. Unfortunately will not return."}
{"text":"I like Sandbar. There wasn't a cover for ladies this particular visit, which was good.  My friends claimed a table by the time we showed up, one with a perfect view of the small dance floor.  I highly recommend staking out a spot there--it's quite entertaining to watch inebriated individuals shake it like there's no tomorrow. The music is decent; pretty standard for a bar.   The service is fast and the bartenders are friendly. The waitress was very attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke.  Our shots arrived in record time.   Did I mention there's sand by the outside bar?  Just don't take off your shoes; I cringe when I think of the lurking shards of glass from an accidental broken bottle."}
{"text":"Showed up on Father's Day during the World Cup with my kids and asked if they could turn the game on after I ordered drinks and food, with 5 patrons there. Manager said \"this is not a soccer bar\". Not sure what he meant by that. But you've lost my business sandbar."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a cool one. It's all beach themed so there is a panorama of the beach and outdoor seating that consists of sand and a mini pool. However the mini pool is apparently used for nothing, so it's fun to guess what you can do with it. There is misters so you do stay cool. The Chandler location is beautiful, I've always liked that side of town, very green and nice!    It consists of two very large bars with a huge variety, I can see a lot of bros and brosettes going there.   Our waitress was very nice and helpful, she checked on us often. I ordered the cheese enchilada. It was okay, wasn't the best, but wasn't horrible. However my friend got the nachos and she just did not like them, so don't order the nachos!   I went here because of the Groupon I received, I don't think I would go there again for food, but definitely for the drinks."}
{"text":"Watch out! The bartenders change the price of drinks. We ordered the same drink three times and got three different totals. The staff is REALLY rude! All of then seem annoyed to work there. I have to assume its poor management."}
{"text":"Just alright....If you go for appetizers, chips and salsa, guac and such, should be good!  Decent service, good drinks, super busy seemingly all the time, mostly a \"meat market\" type crowd."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service!!!  They don't deserve not one star!!!!!   Management!!!! Management!!!   I don't have words!!!  Especially Justin!!  He's rude and a liar!!!! I will never, ever spend a penny in that place again!!!!!  So what happened was I called earlier in the day to see if they would be showing the ufc fight.  They confirmed that yes they would have the fight and that after 6pm they would be charging a $10 cover.  So a bunch of my family and friends went on over around 6 pm.  Only to be charged to watch a damn Iowa football game.  Who the effff wants to pay to watch Iowa!!!! Had I known this, I would of paid to watch the fight at home and saved my money!!!!  We got excuse over excuse as to why they had to play the Iowa game and gave a damn about how we felt and made no effort to try to make their customers who paid to get In their establishment happy.  Worse is that I placed my name on the list at 7pm for a table inside and left at 11:30pm without ever getting seated.  Really!!!! You mean to tell me that in all that time NO ONE left your establishment?!!!!  No courtesy call or anything!!!!   So my son in law got there a couple of hours later and they charged him $20 dollars to get in.  1/2 hour later a couple of our other friends came and they were charged $10 to get in......  What's wrong with this picture?!!!! So  I'm already upset because I paid to watch an effin Iowa game I did not want to see and now this.  I go to the GM Justin again about them charging my son in law $20 and he says that he refunded his money. ok cool.  I get home and I ask my son in law about the GM Justin saying he gave him his money back and he says NO I didn't get my money back!  What!!!! I'm furious!!! Not only is Justin an effin A Hole he's an effin liar!!!!!!  I asked Justin more than once to just give me my money back and I'd leave that establishment and he never once acknowledged what I said.  He didn't give a shit!!!!   The 2 white couples that shared a table with my daughter and I got 20% off their tab and me, I had to pay my full tab.  Don't get me wrong, I have no problem paying my tab that's not it at all.  They problem is that we all had the same issue.  We were unhappy at the service and the false advertisement and having to pay a cover charge to watch a football game but the brown skinned people were treated differently than they white people....   This place sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Too expensive and usually too crowded. Its fine for once in awhile b/c it does look really nice and all the ppl usually look really nice too. They have really nice and expensive private cabanas. They also have big flat screens and a beach theme (duh). Their stools are pretty uncomfortable and its hard to get a booth. I just don't want to have to get dressed up everytime I go to a bar and pay $10 for a shot. I liked going here for Halloween to see all the funny costumes."}
{"text":"The cheese dip was alright.  The bartender was not great.  And why do I feel 80 when I walk in here?  Oh, that's right.  All the \"kids\" working as staff were born in the 90s!  Plus, the frat guys sitting on the porch and around the bar yelling at the football on the 50 TVs in here probably didn't make me feel any younger.  I suppose if you were born after 1990, you should go here.  If not, don't do it.  You just look older under all those fluorescent lights!"}
{"text":"Attended my Aunt's birthday party on a Sunday afternoon. Had a couple cabanas with Alyssa as our waitress who was WONDERFUL and always available. There were about 20 people in our party. Bottle service with mixer was perfect along with drink specials. Food platters were plentiful. My son has a dairy allergy which they accommodated. There were plenty of flatscreens if you want to see any games. Music was a great mix and not too loud so we could talk. The only issue which is kinda big fir late afternoon, their ceiling fans were not working. They had other various fans wired to the posts. It was ok but little hot. We all had a great time!!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon visit.   Great upbeat atmosphere and attentive service.    Happily surprised that my taco plate was not one, not two, but THREE tacos.  Had the Barbacoa and they were so tasty.  Husband had the combo taco plate and he loved those as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in just after 11am on a Sunday. The doors were still locked and the hostess (who looked like she had just rolled out of bed) was staring at us through the glass. We waived at her and asked if they were open while she pretended not to see us. She finally hesitantly opened the door and said, \"we're still getting ready to open\". This was irritating, and I almost told my husband that we should leave. But we waited a few minutes and we were finally seated outside.   It took about 5 minutes for our server to come to our table. She was friendly and took our drink order. There were several other servers and the half asleep Hostess lingering around outside. They decided this would be a great time for them all to have a mini photo shoot while my husband and I waited patiently for our drinks to arrive....  We then placed our food order; chicken tacos with beans and rice. The food arrived quickly and was delicious.   The patio and food are amazing, but the service and lack of professionalism is disappointing. I'm sure we'll be back but will probably wait until noon so that the staff has time to wake up, take pictures together, and finish cleaning up from the night before."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a restaurant that has the annoying 'attendant in the bathroom' tradition forever.  First off, this is a casual Mexican Food restaurant, not a trendy club.  Secondly, the bathroom is dirty and a good part of it is 'out of order.'  Lastly, I am not tipping for someone to hog the sink area with a bunch of cheap junk so that they can hand me a paper towel that I should be able to get myself.  Tacky!"}
{"text":"What a joke! I came to this bar expecting a good time, and I was highly disappointed. The hours of operation online are wrong. I arrived only to realize that they closed before midnight! I wasted my time & my gas, a mess! Don't come here!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!! Good drinks, awesome ambiance, good food. Thats what u look for in a bar"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but my visit to the Sand Bar at Desert Ridge was so exceptional I had to write. It's always good to have a nice meal, but my meal was  exceeded by the staff and the hospitality I felt. It was truly the staff that made my visit so special. This is now my favorite place and I hope they don't get tired of me!  Brent the manager,  took so much of his time to make sure I knew the menu and we had great conversation. I travel alone so I really appreciated our conversation. Myana, Kylee, Alyssa took it from there. I really didn't want to leave. I actually ordered twice so I didn't have to leave !  If that wasn't good enough, one of the owners came over to say hello. Jeff O'Neil ( one of the owners ) came over to say hello. I then had a chance to tell him what a nice culture he and management had developed. This was a world class experience and I highly recommend you enjoy the same experience I did......say hello cuz I'll be there!!  Once again, thank you to all the staff at the Sand Bar for making my day very special."}
{"text":"ZERO stars. Food is awful. There is no reason that something as basic as a burger should be so bland. The people that work there are rude. A bouncer came over to open the \"garage\" and practically pushed me out of the way to get behind my chair. He didn't ask if I would move or even apologize for being practically on top of me.   Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Really fun place for going out drinking with friends.  The patio is quirky and fun (though it can be hot), and they have a DJ.  The drinks and drink variety are delicious and can take the sting out of a very hot day.  The tacos... meh?  They were cheap on Tuesday but not all that great.  The salsas were good though."}
{"text":"Went here on two separate occasions once for dinner once for drinks. Horrible.  I'll start with dinner. Horrible excuse for Mexican food. My husband, who loves Mexican, wouldn't even finish his burrito and my enchiladas were also gross. The food had little flavor and the enchilada sauce was terrible.  For drinks, we went with some friends. Our friends ordered a couple of drinks and we bought a round for them. We felt as though we were double charged. Our waitress brought the manager over and he refused to let us dispute the charge. He kicked all of us out and had our check brought outside to us. They lost 4 customers for good who typically spend a lot of money over $10 worth of drinks."}
{"text":"AGGRESSIVE BOUNCERS!  The place would be a nice hangout if it weren't for the overly aggressive security guards.  My wife and I were hanging out with a couple of friends this weekend.  We were pretty much keeping to ourselves at the patio and hand one of these power hungry jerks decided we had to leave.  He asked me wife if she was ok while we were seated at a table.  She turned to him and said yes and went back to her conversation.  He said 'you're out of here\" for no good reason.  I said hold on, what's the problem so I had to go too. The guy did everything he could to antagonize me, too.  After starting a loud argument with the little jerk, he got his bouncing buddies to quickly rush us out of the door with no explanation.  They were really aggressive about it, and pretty much pushed the ladies out.  My wife tripped while they were rushing us out and actually fell in the pool.  This guy was just a GOON looking for trouble and using his pay nothing job as an excuse to exert his minimal authority.  And from the other reviews on Yelp, this is not rare for this place..  BEWARE OF THESE BOUNCING LOSERS!  Also, when I managed to get the waitress to come over so I could pay our bill, she said this was pretty typical for the bouncers and rolled her eyes.  Well, they just lost a customer.  I would NEVER pay another dime and will make sure none of my friends ever go here again either."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends recently and must say I/we truly had an enjoyable experience. Our wait staff Chris was AWESOME! Everyone in the party enjoyed what they ordered. I will be back to check out the night life here as well being it appears to have a dj. Thank again Chris for taking care of us ladies."}
{"text":"Over-priced, mediocre food. Over-priced under-poured drinks. Terrible service. The only thing this place has going for it is atmosphere.  Frankly, I don't understand why this place is so jam-packed with people.  Trendiness I guess. I am pretty sure we will not be not be going back.  The saving grace for this place came near the end. As we were finishing for the evening the bar manager came by and he was very friendly. I explained the irritation I had with the fact that their burgers do not come with cheese and that the waitress did not suggest cheese options.   This was a mild irritation made worse by the fact that when I asked the waitress about it earlier she had said, \"It's in the menu\" which, of course, if I had seen that, I would have ordered appropriately.    Well anyhow, without expecting it, requesting it, or even actually wanting it, the bar manager did comp my burger. So, for that I guess we will be back at least once.  But we gotta get there during happy hour cause the drink prices are half-off then.  UPDATE: 8/22/13 As you can see from the comment from Leah below, it is this level of leadership commitment that will bring us back to the restaurant for another go.  I will post a brand new review once we do and update this one if our experience is better."}
{"text":"Only nightlife in Desert Ridge Marketplace. PROS: Fun for drinks and people watching, lots of TVs for sports. CONS: Music will make your ears bleed, impossible to hold a conversation. Bathroom attendant- why?! Very awkward. Food, why would you at at a nightclub? I wouldn't, it's kinda grimy. TIPS: Order beer by the bucket. Wisconsin Badger fan bar."}
{"text":"FREE BEER if you stay at the Courtyard Marriott.  That is what brought us in the door.  The fish tacos helped us stay.  It is kind of an odd mix.  Young families with kids who play in the water and younger college age kids who came to drink lots of beer."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed...  again. Here's another one of these restaurants that's hired young, inexperienced waitresses that have NO clue how to wait tables. I was a waitress for many years when I was young and went above and beyond for my customers, many would request to be put in my section because of this. I know that times have changed but customer service is always appreciated, and expected. My husband and I always tip accordingly, not based on the nominal percentage but beyond. I really wanted to like this place, but it get's one star for lack of customer service, and food that was just \"okay\". Not to the point that I wanted to go home and make myself vomit but, you know, sub-par. PS I partially blame management, but there should never ever be a time when you have four or five girls standing at the hostess podium playing grab ass with each other. I don't care one way or the other, but it's unprofessional for the establishment."}
{"text":"OK I am reading alot of good reviews about the Sandbar and I love the atmosphere. But what happened to the food?  Got the Mexican Cobb with the mixed greens. Since when was iceburg lettuce considered mixed greens? Oh well it was good at least.  My friend got the turkey melt with cold hard bread that banged the plate. And the fries were not only cold but hard and hollow on the inside. How can you mess up a french fry?  I have to admit I hardly ever complain but with food like that I will have a hard time coming back for more.  Sorry Sandbar, please kick up the menu for yummy treats and I would like to give you another try."}
{"text":"We went here recently for a friends birthday.  They had rented a cabana, so we didnt have to fight w/ the crowd  or to get a table which was nice. The cabana was spacious and relatively cool because of the misters. Our waitress was surprisingly attentive, yet unenthusiastic. She kept forgetting our DDs drinks. And the drinks were average.  The only real complaint we had is that they kept turning of the misters to the cabanas making it unbearably hot. The misters stayed on the rest of the patio, just not the area where people paid extra to sit, which just seemed wrong to me."}
{"text":"Went to Sandbar today for the first time with coworkers for happy hour. We got there around 2:45 and waited until 3pm to order when happy hour started. I LOVED the atmosphere and the vibe, music and the DJ they had! We didn't end up eating much, but the chips and salsa and green salsa were great. I will go back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Mexican restaurant in the Ahwatukee area and was lured in by the big outdoor patio at Sandbar. I was with family visiting from out of town so I thought they'd like to sit outside and enjoy the warm weather. Unfortunately there were no open tables outside so we ended up sitting inside oh well.  The atmosphere is kinda loud and bar like which was fine. It wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other. Although the waiter had a hard time hearing us as we had to repeat ourselves several times. And he always seemed to big in a big hurry which was kinda weird.  We got chips and salsa and a couple people in our party got margaritas to start with. I was kinda bummed that the chips and salsa were $5 when they're usually free at other places if you order dinner. But the salsa was actually pretty good so it was fine.  I had the carnitas tacos and was a bit underwhelmed. Honestly the carnitas at Chipotle is better. They were fine, 3 to an order but the portions were kinda skimpy. The tortillas were fresh though. I ordered it with rice and beans. The beans were fine but the rice was pretty gross. I don't know if it was the seasoning or what but it was some of the worst mexican rice I've ever had.  The boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas and he said they were not good. He said the sauce on them was more like marinara sauce than enchilada sauce - yuck.   My cousin and her husband didn't say anything so they might have liked it or they were just being polite.  With so many other good places for Mexican here in town I don't think we'll revisit Sandbar anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst place I've had the misfortune of visiting. Be careful putting anything in your mouth!! My brother cut his lip on a glass he was given. The best the manager offered was to offer a round of shots that none of us wanted and to cover one drink per person (4 of us). Poor management concern for their customer....he kept stating it was an accident. I can't imagine how anyone else would have accepted that excuse. We asked for the full bill and will NEVER visit this place again."}
{"text":"Love Sandbar, I feel welcomed every time I come. Jenn makes a great sweet tart in fact the sweet tarts here are always blue, some other places change their color from blue to a weird green color, but here it looks appealing  Management is always nice to and are great people to say hi too.  Anthony always makes this a happy place to be and Richard help makes it even better each time.  Dancing is always fun too, and oh drinking out side in the sand neat."}
{"text":"Without question, one of the worst places to eat in the Valley for Mexican food. The red sauce here is more like sloppy joe sauce than chile sauce, bland overly salted food. Expensive, but you are paying for the atmosphere of the place which is very energetic and fun. Nice televisions, great design, but the food is just terrible. Any other Mexican food place would be better than this."}
{"text":"To me, the Sandbar at Desert Ridge is like a beloved, worn-out pair of shoes that stink to high heaven, that you would never dream of tossing out. It is uber chill and you don't have to rock out 6\" red bottoms to feel like royalty here. Go ahead - wear your flip flops and wife beater - you won't be judged/snubbed - I promise.  Love their HH selections and tacos. And who wouldn't love some sand and tiny splash pool in the middle of the Sonoran desert? I know I do.  Does it get kinda grimy and overcrowded? Absolutely. Do you sometimes get inconsistent quotes on drink specials from various staff at times? Sure. But with all the bad comes the good, right?  I feel comfortable here. It is one of my \"safe places\"."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, service was good but the food, was simply the worst representation of mexican food I've had in a long time.   Had a chicken chimi with a \"mystery\" red sauce that was \"ok\" at first, but the harder I tried to like it, the worse it got. By the time I got halfway through, I just had to stop. The middle of the chimi was bit soft and doey and seemed undercooked, the chicken was fine but the sauce and the undercooked shell was just yucky.   Other people there pushed away an enchilada and a funny look on their face, saying, sorry man, you pick where to eat next time.    I ate at the Desert Ridge location before, had the wings there, but nothing remarkable. I don't see myself returning here for food. Probably an okay place to hang out at the bar for a drink, but doubtful I'll be back for that much.   Just not a good vibe here, and two for two \"meh\" experiences."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant going to this sports bar type of joint. I've been to one before and then had a good idea what the atmosphere would be like. So it was a good time and sure. The vibe was good, good selection with the bar foods,"}
{"text":"I guess I can't understand why the men aren't allowed to wear sleeveless shirts at an outdoor, beach themed bar, but the servers aren't required to wear pants...... we had a drink before dinner and tried to return afterwards and the security team rudely refused us entry do to our attire. Normally I would understand, but when we were already in the building less than 2 hours before seems kind of ridiculous. There's a way to handle this kind of situation and this bar did not handle it in a way that would make me want to come back. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Really, it's my bad for expecting good food and service from a bar known as a party place. My husbands chimi wasn't bad.  My $10 cheese enchiladas were terrible. They were tiny. The cheese was obviously frozen grated because it didn't melt as much as flatten.  Chewy, icky. The red sauce was really odd, sweet. The black beans were slipped on the plate and thrown into the salamander. The juice was cooked all over the side of the plate.  The margarita was ok, but for $7 I expect something more than a plastic glass with a rough edge.  We had $3 iced tea and were never offered refills.  And it was empty within 10 mins of it being sat on the table it was so small. $36 for this meal was painful to pay.  Never again."}
{"text":"I went here today for a mini-vacation from the kiddos and a date with my honey. The staff is very friendly and attentive, the food is yummy, the music is awesome and the atmosphere makes me feel miles away from home. I like the openness and sunlight and having been there twice during the day and once on a Friday night, I definitely prefer the crowd and experience during the day.   My waitress Nikki exchanged my food for me and didn't make a fuss even though it was my fault that I ordered the wrong menu item. My boyfriend called the manager Trev over to thank him for the great experience we had and to compliment our waitress. Trev spent at least 15  minutes talking with us and was very friendly and professional.   I live in Ahwatukee and I'm really glad to have a spot like this to break away from the daily grind. It's like a mini-vacation."}
{"text":"I have been at this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed myself...until Oct 25th. (yes, I have been struggling with writing this review for sometime, as you can see from the date stamp of this review.)  I guess we have always gone on either: A) a Groupon or B) Happy Hour,  C) someone else paying, or D), so many marg's I never noticed the bill!?!?!  Either way...Late lunch on a Friday proved to be most different.  1). The chips were COLD..not just room temperature, but COLD..and HARD. 2). NO red salsa offered...were they out of it???  3). $35 for 6 Corona's...Let me repeat...$35 for a SIX PACK of MEXICAN BEER (I'm at a mexican restaurant, right?). 4.) LUNCH BILL totaled $70 for TWO PEOPLE.  uh, I don't think I'll make that mistake again.....EVER.  Word of caution....DO NOT ORDER MEXICAN BEER unless you got lots of dinero!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!! There is a serious issue going on here  with women being slipped drugs in their drinks.  This has happened twice to my 27 yo daughter, about 6 months apart.  It happened to her again last night.  She was so ill that she had to go to the er at 2:00 am.  The er doctor asked where she had been, and when she said Sandbar Desert Ridge, the doctor told her that several other women had  come in for the same thing over a period of time, all from Sandbar Desert Ridge!! Management had better take a long, hard look into the matter before someone decides to sue!"}
{"text":"Ok god. We keep trying. And we keep being disappointed. Today. I say \"let's try Sandbar again\". It's been a year since our last time there and a horrible experience then. But we figure you can't go wrong with day drinking. Arrive right after 3. It's Happy Hour. Also lady's day. Supposed to be half off drinks and apps for ladies all day. Last I checked my genitalia I'm a lady. I guess bartender didn't think so. 4 drinks $18. Charged full price all drinks. I really wouldn't care except you advertise ladies day everywhere. Not sure why???   This kind of issue occurs ALL THE MF''n time here. Why do we keep trying???  Really we are done. Because in perspective, ALWAYS a service issue. So we just say. Why even make the damn effort to cross the ten when there are 20 bars with happy hour specials in awhatukee that treat you well and don't make you bring your own lube to happy hour???"}
{"text":"Hated the food! Hated the stomach issues! Hated the prices!! 12 bucks for tacos with no flavor and rice that......well cant explain that one. Thank god i did not have the beans also or i may still be on the toilet. I saw many reviews on the party vibe and they are right. If you want to come for the drinks with friends this is your place. My wife and i thought after seeing the menu to bolt but we didn't. And both of our stomaches and wallet payed the price."}
{"text":"I come here for the night time experience. Absolutely love it. Great drinks and quick service and all different kinds of great music. Lots of couples and lots of single people. Win win"}
{"text":"Love the new Sandbar at Desert Ridge!  The patio is so inviting, and a place like this is much needed in this area.  I'm pretty sure that this will be my new spot for strawberry margaritas during happy hour.  We came for opening night and tried the guacamole and mussels.  It was insanely busy, but I couldn't believe how quickly our order came out, considering it was their first night open and how many people were there!  The guacamole was great- I'm very picky about my guacamole, at some restaurants it gets a stale taste to it.  At Sandbar, however, it was fresh and nicely prepared.  The mussels were phenomenal.  I've always been more of an oyster gal myself; mussels always seem to come out a little too fishy for my taste.  However, ours came out very well.  Overall, we had a blast.  FINALLY, a great place in the Desert Ridge area! Kudos!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to come here for drinks and tacos after work on Friday.  It's also a great lunch time spot.  I order the same thing every time: strawberry margaritas on the rocks and the ancho chili mahi tacos.  So delicious.   They are not shy with the alcohol, either.  Two margs and I'm done!  There seems to be some haters who yelped... I don't know what you thought when you walked up and saw a bunch of college flags outside, a huge bar with cabanas, and servers who don't wear much (well, the girls), if you thought it was a fancy restaurant or a place like macayos, you're WRONG!  It's a bar with yummy bar food.  Bottomline: This place is for the young AND young at heart!"}
{"text":"One of the worst bars I have ever been to. The customer service straight up sucks. Their bartenders and servers are horrible and need some serious training in customer service and hospitality. We got our waters after waiting for an hour and our server was missing for almost 40 mins straight. Never going here again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was great. My niece celebrated her 22nd Birthday and everything was fantastic. I want to thank Mac for working with us to set everything up. She made the process so nice and smooth. Also big shout out to our waitress Hailey. She was absolutely amazing. The place was packed but Hailey was always available to us.  We never had to wait long for anything. Thank you both so very much for being a part of making my niece's birthday party so memorable. We will be back. Managers please give these ladies the kudos they deserve. Your business is lucky to have them."}
{"text":"Went to enjoy some tacos at Sandbar's \"Taco Tuesday.\" The place was packed both inside and outside, yet my party and I did not have to wait long for a table. Now for the service... We ordered a simple appetizer, chips and salsa with guacamole. I understand it was busy, but the length of time to finally receive this led me to believe they had to haul ass down to Mexico to get the avocados for the guacamole and handpick the veggies from the garden to make the salsa. Believe me, the guac was tasty as well as the salsas, but we waited well over 15 mins just to get chips and guac and not once did the waitress apologize for the wait and assure us it was coming, or even ask how we were doing on drinks. Instead she looked at us as if we were from a different planet and honestly, I bet if we were on a different planet we would have received faster service. We ended up ordering a variety of tacos after that and they were good, but at that point it was just a matter of consuming the food so we could get out of there. Both the appetizer and chips were good, but the service brought the total experience down to 3 stars. Might try again and cross my fingers for a more competent waitress."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early dinner , it started out just okay! We had no silverware or plates with our appetizers . Dinner came and it was delivered the waitress never checked if we needed anything else. We then asked for our check and boxes for our food that was taking forever, lucky for us a server by the name of Kelly stepped in got the boxes for us and extra chips ... she was super helpful ! Found out she is new. She's the reason for the 5 stars ... thanks Kelly for picking up the slack ."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party bus of 30 people and Brandon was awesome accommodating our party. This bar is a great place to go to because of the huge layout and ease of ordering drinks. Plenty of beautiful women and friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit when visiting family in Az. Great margaritas and a big selection of craft beers. Appetizers are pretty darn good as well."}
{"text":"Been here three times. One total epic fail and two mediocre. Took forever to get served even on the good visits. Mac n cheese app is tasty. Groups of four each time and different entrees around. Nobody had anything to rave about.  The good news is also the bad news. It is open air and outside. So you enjoy fresh air. Unless they are smoking at the next table. Somehow I get the impression that the clientele here had a higher proportion of smokers. It certainly took away from our enjoyment."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star dining experience. The food is mediocre but the drinks are good and it's a fun atmosphere. Our waitress was very attentive with our food and drink orders but then was nowhere to be found when it came time to get the check. We sat there chatting for about 20 minutes after we finished eating before we saw her. Not a big deal because we just wanted to chill anyway but it would have been nice to be acknowledged. We came on a Monday so we enjoyed $5 margarita specials and a relatively quiet atmosphere. I like the beach scenes on the wall and outdoor space. It was too cold to enjoy it but we will come back in a few months and sit outside. Husband ordered the burger and rated it on par with red robin or a similar chain. I ordered coconut shrimp and they were very flavorful but small portion. Ten dollars for four shrimp. The chips and salsa were just ok but they were free so we cannot really complain too much. I look forward to returning and hanging out outdoors. I could see it being fun and maybe a little crazy on weekends!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this: I was practically dragged here kicking and screaming.   Whenever my in-laws visit town, they always wind up at the Sandbar and tell us how great it is. Except for that one time - you know, the time they got food poisoning. Despite this, my in-laws have been back several times and recently invited my husband and myself to join them. To put it mildly, I was a little hesitant.  First and foremost, Sandbar gets its name from the outside bar they have with actual sand and cabanas. Some of the bar top tables are surf boards and everything is extremely colorful and tropical seeming. Not relaxing tropical, but party tropical with loud music blaring. When I had to go inside to the restroom, I gagged on the sewage smell and almost passed out from the color scheme. Everything is multicolored - the tables, the chairs, the walls. Oh god. So colorful.   The actual food was decent but I'll admit, I didn't eat much. The group ordered two of their triple dip - which is some white queso dip (tastes like melted down Cheetos and not in a good way), a refried bean dip (meh), and some guacamole (eh-okay). The chips come in a metal beer bucket which is supposedly bottomless. Now, I'm not sure if we ordered salsa or if it was free, but it was just mediocre as well. Someone was crazy enough to order the coconut shrimp, the ancho ribs, and the honey jalapeno chicken wings. You can order the wings boneless, which we did, but those just turned out to be popcorn chicken drenched in sauce. Not a winner-winner, chicken-dinner. As for the ribs, they were okay - again heavy on the sauce.   I was hesitant to order a drink, since I'm more of a mixed cocktail sort of girl and nothing looked amazing. (What can I say, I'm really picky when it comes to liquor.) My in-laws and other relatives ordered beer and wine, which seemed great to them. The waiter was quick to fill up a glass and bring out fresh bottles.   Overall, it wasn't terrible but I won't be back on my own volition. I'm sure there are plenty of people that love the Sandbar (especially my in-laws) but it is definitely not my kind of restaurant or bar."}
{"text":"Love the bar itself, it's a fun atmosphere very laid back, they play great music & it's a good place to come just hang out. The service however is awful! 2pm on a weekday and it took me 15 min to grab the bartenders attention because she's just talking away with coworkers. On a slow day it shouldn't take me more than 15min to get service. The girls here are more concerned with socializing with their peers than anything else. The service is the only thing they should really start working on"}
{"text":"Thursday ladies drink 1/2 all day! Great atmosphere great time! Had a few appetizers, calamari was my favorite! Good space for larger groups of people. Tv's everywhere so I could see it being a good place to watch different sporting events!"}
{"text":"Whhyyyyyy??   Why do I get dragged here at least 3 times a year? The former location off of Shea was a little better but not by much.  Drinks way overpriced. Douchebag factor high. Bartenders and security are rude.   One time I went to the DJ for a request, for some fun 80's hip hop. He gave me a dirty look then ignored me.   I had the food once, and I totally regret it. It was bad, bad, bad.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Over priced drinks.  Occupants are typically 35 years old or older.... but trying to act younger.  Not much for dancing, and not in area meant for hoping around. If you drink here, there is no where else to go.   Not a fan."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for work sponsored happy hours, which means I've never paid, which naturally raises my rating by a star. Anything free is always better, right?  That said, I like this location. Service is attentive enough, food is OK, and the outdoor area with all the sand (get it? SANDbar...) is really cool. They've got heaters for the winter and misters for the summer, as well as big fans to keep the air circulating. Drink specials are good during happy hour, and there are some food specials as well.   Saw a coworker accidentally walk into the wading pool, and ended up soaked to the thighs...That was pretty funny.   Sandbar is a good place to come get drinks if you're in Chandler, sit outside if it's not too brutal, it's a much more fun experience than being inside."}
{"text":"Came for a friend's birthday. Had a cabana rented and was seated almost immediately. Servers were very attentive to the group (about 10 people) and made sure everything was going well.  The minimum bill (for all items ordered) for the cabana is $300 split between all people, which is easy to reach. That's not as bad as it sounds... the food and drinks are good enough to order enough to reach the limit.  Atmosphere is okay. The music isn't always going to match what you enjoy, but it's a good mix. But if you're paying more attention to the music than your company, something's wrong. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food! Great atmosphere. Waiter was very friendly and fun also very attentive to checking on us."}
{"text":"Joke!  Same as North Sandbar!  Worst service ever!   Wednesday night and no service after sitting at bar for 15 minutes!   Go across street to any other bar!!!"}
{"text":"I think there's a lot to be said about this place and it's difficult to know where to begin. Went on a Saturday night around 10pm, cover was $5 and the place was packed with what seemed to be a regular party crowd.   It's very difficult to pin this place. From what I could tell it's a restaurant by day, nightclub by night. Great concept, but a little shaky in practice. When you first walk in, there's a bar that spans the whole length of the place so I guess that shows you where their priorities lie. There is also a second bar outside for those willing. The proprietors were also kind enough to provide a large fan (the kind you see on the field at football games with the connection to the hose to keep you extra cool) so should you choose to come here you will more than likely be pretty cool outside. There is also a dance floor and the music is not bad, although it's nothing to call home about.   Something the owners seem to have taken to heart is the name of the place as they have been kind enough to sprinkle the outdoor patio with sand. Now, normally I would have no problem with this, but there's the minor detail that we happen to be about 400 miles away from the nearest ocean. There's something slightly off-putting about having sand on the ground at a nightclub.  I need to finally comment on the caliber of gentlemen who seem to frequent this place. Normally, I wouldn't comment, but in this case I feel like it should at least be mentioned. At the beginning of the night, a man was at the bar and turned around and elbowed my friend's drink. He appeared to be unfazed as his drink was alright and did not bother to apologize to her. When I appeared shocked that he didn't have any common courtesy he, of course, got in my face. That is, after all, the gentlemanly thing to do. Later in the night, two forty-something guys were hitting on my friends. They were about as subtle as a jumbo jet landing -- that is to say, they weren't. They unabashedly proclaimed their intentions despite my friends repeated rebukes.   It should also be noted that the bouncer-to-patron ratio is very high. I'm not sure what the owners expect to take place, but the bouncers were gruff and not very polite despite the fact that we had done nothing wrong.   This place was very packed, but I think that stemmed more from the fact that it was a Saturday night and less from the fact that this place is a genuinely cool place to hang out. I regret to say that my friend made a poor choice in choosing her birthday location and given the choice, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the level of customer service today. My coworkers and I frequent this location for lunch. Today I had such a horrible experience that I feel obligated to provide feedback. First, we were seated promptly however the waitress did not provide a lunch menu. I asked for a water, my coworker ordered a margarita (5.00 special). It literally took out server Haylee more than 20 min to get our drinks. When she returned we still hadn't been provided a lunch menu. I then took it upon myself to grab one from the bar. Next, we waited another 15 minutes to get our food order placed. Please be advised that the restaurant only had a hand full of patrons at the time. Last, my order was wrong so I had to wait another 15 minutes for this to be corrected.  Haylee never checked in nor did she offer to refuel my empty glass. Overall, very poor experience. Hopefully this situation gets addressed otherwise we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice selection of happy hour drinks. If you order entree ask for chip and salsa. Don't automatically bring them I guess. Fajitas were good. Chili Rellenos was excellent. Friendly staff. Outdoor seating would have been nice but too many smokers."}
{"text":"Love love!! My friends and I have gone every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday for about a year now. You cant beat $2 dos equis, $4 margs and $2-3 tacos!! We ALWAYS sit with Michelle, she is the BEST! Always attentive and never gets our order wrong. Many of the other servers rock too! Andrew, Gia, Mariah. And Samantha, the bartender, is just a kick ass girl.  All in all this place is just a good spot for good fun and good times with your friends."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were in the area for sushi and decided we wanted to happy hour it up so we made our way over to Sandbar.  Once we were seated with our menus we were wishing we had started there rather than finishing because it was Taco Tuesday and they had $2 tacos!!!  That would have been way better than the average-at-best sushi we had eaten just before....so in order to drown our sorrows we got straight to the business of discounted drinks!  I can't recall all the drink specials but I know wells were $4 and I think drafts were $3?  Our waitress was awesome too, she stopped by pretty frequently to see how we were doing and get us whatever we needed, plus she was super friendly and was joking around with us.  I wish I would have gotten her name!  Definitely a happy hour I will be frequenting again in the future!"}
{"text":"The SERVICE was horrible!! The taco guy was amazing but we waited 20 minutes along with tables next to us with empty glasses and the waitresses wouldn't even acknowledge you, talked to each other and played with their hair. I used to love this place and made my husband go there tonight to get the worst service I have ever seen. Only gave 2 stars because the taco guys tacos were better than the kitchens.  Not sure I will ever go back and this was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but not as kid-friendly as other places in the area.  The wait-staff is hot but not overly friendly.  Better for happy hour and late night madness for 20-somethings...and food is just okay!"}
{"text":"Our first visit, 2pm .. only few guests at the time of our visit. the restaurant is huge.. + outdoor patio seating. Televisions are everywhere, this is a great place to go watch football with friends. Ordered wings, if you like crispy wings these are not for you. Also ordered the cookie skillet with ice cream.. it took little bit over 30 minutes to get it ( it was delicious), the young waitress apologized even though we didn't complain, when the check arrived, she said the manager took care of the desert. Unexpected but appreciated.. what a great customer service. Thank you.   Can't wait to return and try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try since the last experience wasn't the best. And better yet, we will not be back. We got a table outside somehow since it was packed and waited for at least 20 mins to get service. So some of our party ended up getting our first round of drinks at the bar. 10 mins later a girl came up asking if we were doing okay since \"we already got our drinks from the bar\". Then throughout the whole evening we had 3 different servers come up to us every so often. It was the worst service ever. Then our food was super cold and we couldn't even get our servers attention to let her know about the food. Also dropped our checks off when we wanted to stay longer and said she had to leave and she refused to transfer us when she wasn't even wiling to check on us all night. Please teach your staff the steps of service or at least teach them how to be a better server!!!"}
{"text":"This rating is for \"Katie\" the chicken quesadillas, and the margaritas. Katie was awesome. Her welcoming spirit was outstanding and her margaritas were fabulous. Thanks to her I'm aware of the god and drink specials so all of this combined plus Katie's kind and professional service are reasons I will DEFINITELY go back to The Sandbar in Chandler. Kudos Katie!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a Packers game on Sunday.... when the packers and Aaron Rodgers actually show up! They have food and drink specials"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a weekday. Was a great experience and food was exactly what we were looking for. Andi, our waitperson was friendly and professional. Haven't had a blended Margarita in years and must say I don't ever remember having one so amazing - ice so fine, flavor not overly sweet nor bitter. We had a lunch special - chicken quesadilla and the portion and price were great. Will return for lunch again."}
{"text":"Great place!  Stopped in for Happy Hour!  Great prices.  Mandy and Troy our bartenders were amazing!  They worked so hard always checking on their customers!  Manager Pamela came around a few times to check on us!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place they have good drinks, good music, tons of parking and a overall good vibe. If you are looking for a place to do a little dancing, drinking and mingling come here."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars as it is a pretty terrible place however their food is better than most bars and it popped up in a location that is in desperate need of things to do at night.  Due to the last attribute I mentioned and the fact that it is still relatively new, it is packed Thurs-Sun. Legitimately packed. Like with a line to get in. To SANDBAR!!! Not to be overly judgmental, but if my weekend's turn into me waiting in line to get into a freakin Sandbar, just kill me. Seriously. There is also a VIP line complete with girl holding a clipboard to bless the lucky few who want to wait 20 min for a beer in their Cabana rather than 20 minutes to get a beer at a bar table like the rest of us. That's right, I said a VIP line for SANDBAR!!!  The outside chairs are super uncomfortable, the service is SLOW and for whatever reason it seems like every single patron smokes which seriously grosses me out and makes me ill, but hey, on the off days when I can guarantee myself a seat at a booth inside, I might stop in for a beer, some grub and a ballgame...maybe."}
{"text":"A laid back beach vibe, huge patio and more than enough TVs makes Sandbar more of a great happy hour spot.  My friends and I have always referred to it as the Dos Gringos for \"grownups.\"  More of an upper 20's & 30's crowd.  If you're looking to get a great deal on your meal during other times, there's a $30 for $15 deal on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  This sums up my last trip: Chips, salsa and guacamole = Awesome.  Super Fresh.  This wasn't some out of can/bag and thrown on the plate app.  The massive portion and freshness justifies the price.  Rest of our meal (Ahi Tacos and Ancho Chili Mahi Tacos) = Good, but nothing to write home about.  Service = Spotty.  It took forever to get our drink orders.  When my beer and my girlfriend's diet coke arrived we ordered the appetizer.  When the waitress came by a few moments later to tell us the order would be out in a few minutes, we went ahead and ordered or meals.  Again, it felt like a long time before the chips and guacamole were brought to the table.  But our meals arrived only moments after we received our appetizer.  Although our server was really nice (or maybe I just thought she was since she was cute)."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Chandler much but I did want to mention that I was at the grand opening of this new Sandbar and know the NEW owner of this specific location.  He told me he was revamping the current menu and that I would be very impressed.  Well...he was right!  Being a lover of Taco's but not a lover of eating a lot of carb loaded tortillas, this new Sandbar has the best option I have ever seen to be able to keep the pleasure of eating a taco with your hands and not just picking at the inside of it with a fork.  They have managed to transform the tortilla into a soft jiacama wrap.  Its delicios and goes very well with their mahi mahi or ahi taco's.  Add in some black beans and guacamole and you have the perfect light and nutritious meal.  I also recommend the pork adovado and basically every other item on the menu has been revamped and has a fresh twist on what was pretty average mexican fare..."}
{"text":"We had a big work group get together here for happy hour. It was okay - we went on a Tuesday and got the awesome Taco Tuesday prices (most tacos are $2 each, a few specialty ones are $3, and house margs are $4) but the service was pretty blah. Our actual waitress was very attentive but the hostess was absolutely clueless about our reservation, which I had confirmed, and she seemed annoyed/frazzled about getting our table together. A few of us went early and had a few drinks at the bar, which was not busy, but the bar tender was hard to flag down and painfully slow.   It wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't good either. It was too hot to go outside so we didn't get to hang out on the sand, which made Sandbar become just another subpar Mexican place."}
{"text":"Slamming and perfect food portion sizes. And we are lit after a long day of work  good drinks and fair pricing. Music was so 90s too and on point. The waitstaff was running around all night. Never had to wait long to order or cash out. Only con was having police at the entry way on our way out. So we saw this and left for another spot."}
{"text":"Decently priced, great margaritas, and a fun (although bro-y) atmosphere. If you choose to seat yourself outside, be warned-- you will be waiting 10-15 minutes until someone gets around to checking in with you. It's probably no fault of the servers, both times I've been, they were super busy. Ask for as much as you can in one breath; water, napkins, and silverware, otherwise you may be without utensils when your food is served.  The guacamole is ok... but it's a huge serving (3 of us split it and still had some left over) and goes well with anything you order. They also bring you two salsas, both of which are really good. It also comes with a bucket of great chips and they give free refills which I encourage you to avoid, otherwise your food will come and you'll be stuffed!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great deals for taco Tuesday and Thursday ladies night. Been a long time favorite for weekend drinks and dancing. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Never again will I go back to sandbar. I got there at 5:30pm looking to eat with my friends after the PGA tour. We knew we would have to wait for a little so we went to the bar. There were a ton of open tables that said reserved no big deal. We noticed that one said reserved at 6pm so when 7pm came around we asked if we could take that table....nope shot down real quick. So we waited a little longer still no table available but there were 5-6 tables empty around us. The staff did inform us if we wanted to order food at the bar we could hold our plates.....so we ordered some food and took our plates to the table reserved that said 6pm. We order just about $100 worth of food and the waitress said when the party arrives we need to leave it is the owners table Let just say the party never arrived and I will never give them my business again. I give them one star because the only thing good was there stale chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Always busy but service is great. Food is much higher quality than you'd expect. Fun place to watch the game and good people watching too. Nice to feel the sand beneath your toes!"}
{"text":"Sandbar is by far my favorite bar in Chandler! Not only are the drinks amazing but the food is amazing too! It's not your typical bar food experience because literally everything tastes amazing! Thursday is ladies day and ladies get half off drinks! They always have amazing music and the atmosphere is great too! Honestly nothing I don't love about this place!"}
{"text":"Sandbar is such a fun spot in North Phoenix! For years I have lived only about 5 minutes away, so I cannot believe I'm just now discovering how fun it is, and how friendly their staff is! My server, Becca, was the absolute sweetest - and very helpful for a group of newcomers! I came in with a group of friends late on a Sunday evening, so we were able to enjoy the chill Sandbar vibes and catch the last of a couple football games that were on. We all ordered frozen margaritas and munched on chips, salsa & their tasty guacamole. Great place to catch up with friends, watch sports, and enjoy awesome HH deals. Hope to be back in soon!"}
{"text":"Went here with my dad and was hoping for good wings. I was impressed! The wings were SO good, really hot too! Well I was more impressed with what my dad ordered which was the special for Fridays which were the fajitas! WOW! Those were delicious! Never had better fajitas!   Went on a Friday night expecting to wait an hour or so because of how busy it was. Instead we got seated right away and got our drinks and orders in immediately. Waited about 5 minutes and I went to the bathroom which by the way was neat as they had a bathroom attendant. I'm pretty young and I've never seen that before so it was pretty interesting haha. I came back and our food was there on the table, steaming and looking great! It had only been maybe 5 minutes and we already had our food! After an amazing meal, the bill was fair and not at all what I was expecting. I was thinking it was gonna be an arm and a leg, no! About $15/person, not bad! My friend told me to not go here for her own reasons but I ignored her and I am GLAD I did!"}
{"text":"Dos Equis Amber drafts are two dollars on Tuesdays. They're 20 oz glasses. Allow me to Captain Obvious this for ya.  Seven glasses of this fine spirited brew, or approximately 140 ounces, (just a little over a gallon) will only cost you fourteen bucks, under twenty with the tip.  And you don't even have to wait until happy hour!  For me, this means a BAL somewhere in the 1.2 vicinity, or as I like to put it; legally fun.  For you, (my bragging little co-worker)  at 125 pounds and seven beers, you'll be a skosh higher than this, say around 3.25 and fast approaching legally embarrassing.  But you still have a few motor skills remaining and there are plenty of activities you can partake in at this BAL, such as:  *Spastic dancing on the concrete counter at the bar. *Flashing your tits at virtually no-one.  It's two in the afternoon.  *Being forcibly removed from the concrete counter prior to stumbling off the bar and into a stool.  This followed by:   *Telling me all about what a dick Jeremy is and how you should have never moved in with him. (I don't even know him) *Listening (uninterested) as you tell me your life story. (Cheerleader, yeah, right)  *Uncontrolled sobbing, followed by;  *Uncontrolled puking,.followed by;  *Passing out.  You also peed in the cab on the way home. Just thought you should know.  Next time you tell me how you're Italian, and how you can drink me under the table, you may wanna think twice. I weigh twice what you do. The nachos weren't such a hot idea either.  I hope you're reading this."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night, it was packed with lots of good looking peeps.  No cover (NICE!) and we ordered a sampler appetizer and the food was pretty good.  The white sauce on the nachos were awesome and we had several drinks throughout the night.  It was lots of fun and the bill was not surprising for a bar like this.  I would definitely go back, the outdoor part was great for the weather we have here in November.  The atmosphere is great, cant remember much now that I had 2 shots and about 4 drinks before I had to get a ride home."}
{"text":"If this review was about the atmosphere and waitstaff service  I'd give it a great review.     I understand that bars stop serving at 2 AM.  It's not right that the security guards here rudely yelled at all their paying patrons on a Saturday night  \"everyone get out!! we want to go home!!\"    I quickly pay, leave and find out there's a 20 min wait to get an uber. I go back to the entrance and ask the 3 security guards sitting in chairs in the front if I could quickly use the restroom before my uber gets there.  I was rudely denied. One security guard asked \" how long will it take\" I respond by saying less than a minute. The Security guard said \"that's too long sorry\".  4 security guards sitting nearby laughed and made a joke out of. Pretty unreal that grown men would act that way.    Fast forward 2 months and Myself and 6 colleagues come here for happy hour. Two belligerently drunken bro-type dudes ask if they can sit at the end of our 8 person table.  We politely tell them it's cool, no ones sitting there.  There were plenty of open seats everywhere in the bar so we found it a bit weird that they would want to sit with us.   To keep it short, they were a nuisance and were being provocative to us.   I see a security guard come to the table to talk to them and I'm thinking great they are getting kicking out for being obviously too intoxicated.   Nope!  The security guard gave them hugs and they knew each other.  Figures!  We all left shortly after and took our business somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Sand Bar has a \"Taco Tuesday\" special.  The food is less than average.  The real issue is what kind of culture and business the Sand Bar is.  I have been to Sand Bar several times and on this Tuesday I'm surprised that people bring little kids to this bar, two little blond boys run around this bar without supervision, this is a Bar and not a place for kids, it's a biker hang out.  The bartenders and waitresses are dressed inappropriately for kids.  The bar is fun but the trashy clientele is not kid friendly.  Shame on you Sand Bar for allowing little kids to run around freely in that kind of environment!!"}
{"text":"Yes there is sand and yes its a bar, nothing great.. wait.. what.. ahi tacos with jicama tortillas... yeah thats right..... listen up!  Its just like any ole mexican/ cantina/ whatever bar..except... this is the only reason i am writing this... I was super interested in the ahi tacos with a jicama tortilla. what is this you say? they use thinly sliced pieces of jicama instead of a tortilla!! I watch my carbs so this was a famtastic option but the taste was incredible!! I cannot wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time there was on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  We were not impressed.  We had to ask for flatware, napkins and plates for our queso dip. The house marg was awful. It took our food forever to arrive. Agter all if that, I wasn't really looking forward to the food but man, I have to say, was that Chirizo burger delish! But, we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"My buddy calls me a week ago, he says: I reserved a cabana at Sandbar for next weekend, can you go?   Not knowing anything about Sandbar, my first thought is: ... a cabana? This guy's known me for 20 years. When have I Ever given him the impression that I want to hang out in a cabana?  ... An effing cabana!?   I answer: Sure man! What time?  Fast Forward One Week...  It's Saturday night around 9:30-10pm. I pull into the parking lot and I see Sandbar Mexican Grill. Oh ok, I get it. This must be a little Mexican restaurant that has cabanas and we're going to eat and make interesting conversation. This should be fun!  I walk up and first notice the motorcade of taxis hanging around outside. Hmm interesting. Then I almost reach the door, and there are 3 door men... ok... that's a bit odd for a Mexican restaurant in a suburban outdoor shopping mall, I thought. The one guy who checked my ID was really nice. I told him I was meeting some friends but they hadn't arrived yet. He told me to go on in and grab a drink. So far so good, I guess.   I opened the door and get bombarded with loud club music, in a dimly lit club-like atmosphere. I'll be honest, I went into fight or flight mode. I turned right back around and proceeded to walk outside, then told the friendly door man I'd wait for my friends to arrive. To my car I went, to contemplate ways to feign illness so I wouldn't have to go back into that awful environment.   Then I got the call... We're here, where are you?   Actual: I'm in my car hyperventilating.   What I said: Cool, I'll be right there.  We all checked back in with the helpful door man and were then escorted like some kind of VIPs to this coveted cabana area. The ladies sat down and us guys stood and talked college football... because that's what men do, right?   A nice young lady came up and took our drink orders. It was at this time that I realized how old I am because I just called her a \"nice young lady\". We were fitted with wrist bands that symbolized to the other people in the bar that we were awesome, and only we could enter the cabana area. Only Us! Not You! There were even four tough looking chaps guarding the entrance to the cabanas so no \"unauthorized\" people could enter. I felt like such an asshole.   My friends ordered some food. I didn't eat. It was way too late (another sign I'm old). The food looked okay. They seemed to enjoy it.  We had a few drinks, chatted and stayed until about 12:30am. I enjoyed the time with my friends, but this is not a place I would generally choose as a hangout. At least not at night. It may be less... umm what's the word... douchey, during the day.   The people bumping, the people grinding, the people making out in the cabana next to ours... this just wasn't my scene. If you're in your twentys and single, you may enjoy the night life at this place. I'm neither of those and hope I never have to come back."}
{"text":"Happy hr is good. Great tv selection and beer. Bit disappointed with my meal. Order jalapeño honey boneless wings and even over the sauce all I taste is deep fried fish- change you oil please. Chicken should taste like chicken!"}
{"text":"First time there I had a blast. Second time there one of the bartenders made my drink. I could only taste soda, and yet still tipped. Later she came after me giving me shit for the low tip, being very disrespectful and insulting. I let it go. She ended up ignoring me and waving her hands at me any time my friend or I ordered. No big deal I just won't be returning ever again."}
{"text":"Came here for the Cinco De Mayo celebration this past Friday night, and I had a blast! The cover was $10 for ladies and $20 for men. However, I do not think there is a cover normally, just on nights they have events. They had some pretty great live band performances! The drinks (especially the strawberry margaritas) are pretty good! This bar is super spacious and modern! They also have a decent menu, with some pretty delicious food items. I had never been to Sandbar before, but I had a great time! Next time I'm in town, I'm gonna come back!"}
{"text":"Bar food with an energetic vibe and enthusiastic staff.  They had a DJ on Thursday (ladies night).  I hear it's a decent place to meet someone."}
{"text":"Just moved down here, ended up at the Sandbar on a Tuesday. Apparently Tuesday's are $2 taco night (any taco is $2). Amazing deal and great tacos! Service was good and atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun,  but the service is really hit or miss! We've had five start service and we've had service that doesn't even deserve a star. It's such a shame because this place has such potential! If you have a lot of time on your hands go ahead and try it out. Last time we were there my husband had to walk back in the kitchen to get someone's attention after waiting to order for 45 minutes (with no drink or anything) Another thing I find weird is......sometimes we get chips and salsa, and sometimes we don't. I believe they are free, but not sure...."}
{"text":"Very much of a bar setting. Margaritas are yummy. The smokey salsa is delicious. Salad is small for the price but very fresh and tastes good the spicy ranch is good chicken was a little burnt. The enchalads are OK not delicious. They are good but nothing special needs some spicy sauce and possibly the meat to be seasoned a little more. Would try again if in the area because it is a locally owned business."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service is a lot to be desired. Our server Alex was not very attentive and spent very little time at our table. It took what seems like over 30 minutes to get our tab and pay.  Alex, be sure to take care of your guests and check back often! We hardly saw you!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to sandbar for a drink and although the service was very good and the drinks came promptly .. We couldn't help but notice all the girls wearing shorts so short that not only were their butt cheeks hanging out (which didn't really bother me) but they kept picking their weggies out of their butt and crotches. It was very gross and disturbing especially knowing they didn't wash their hands one time. I get the appeal, being in the Industry myself, of dressing this way but please at least try and  keep it sanitary! Thanks !!"}
{"text":"I met up with some coworkers for a happy hour, and even though I used to live at Dobson & Warner, I hadn't previously ventured to the Sandbar. I arrived early just after the start of happy hour and had no trouble finding a parking spot or a nice table on the patio - across from the fire pit, in the sand, near an umbrella. Perfect.   During happy hour they had $2.50 Dos Ambers and $4 frozen marguerites. I started with both. The waitress was cool and took excellent care of me all evening - can't remember her name, but the ticket read \"Smiles\". The drinks kept coming, as did the friends, and just a couple of raindrops too. It was an excellent bar for people watching and everyone was friendly.  With the beer, the sand, the reggae it was a very good time. It was my first time there, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just finished my chicken enchiladas with the green sauce. Ive  eaten here a few times now and am not impressed. The chicken was dry and the green sauce was almost non existent.  The portions were small for a Mexican place. They have a dj on Sundays and this guy might have been the worst."}
{"text":"I came to Sandbar for happy hour with my wife and her coworkers. We ordered the boneless wings in mild and they were extremely hot. We also ordered the cookie a la mode and it was even more disappointing. Was thin and small and wasn't cooked well. The drinks were satisfactory and nice ambience."}
{"text":"I always lie a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have a cookie cutter Mexican menu.  Went for taco Tuesday so just focused on the taco menu.  All were very good.   I believe they get some good crowds at night.  This seems part club part Mexican grill.  It's not fancy inside actually rather worn.  But for casual bar it fits the bill.  From the outside and name I actually thought it was going to be a little fancier then it actually is (not that I'm saying that is bad).    Will return for a casual lunch or dinner or if wanting a lively place to grab some drinks."}
{"text":"The table was filthy when we arrived...we waited for about 10 minutes before we got service...my friend stumbled and was accused of being \"too drunk.\" We were swiftly removed from the premises. My friend only had three drinks and was far from being intoxicated. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop for a Bloody Mary and football game after a morning hike."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch this past Friday. First time eating here. Good service. Good chips and salsa. Had fish tacos w rice and black beans and it was all very good. I would return anytime. Great lunch place."}
{"text":"This place left much to be desired- way too loud and disorganized for my taste.   It was like a frat party for everyone is the area for after work drinks. Food was also sloppy and tasteless- I would PASS."}
{"text":"Sandbar has really gone downhill. Used to be a fun place to hang out. It's a classless, rowdy crowd these days. I witnessed clearly intoxicated patrons served repeatedly until they were fall-down drunk. I am seriously considering filing a formal complaint with the liquor commission."}
{"text":"Live for their chicken nachos! The cheese sauce they use is addictive, and they do a good job balancing the flavored. Girls night on Thursday has half priced drinks all night. Best place in Desert Ridge to watch sports... However, smokers are allowed on the patio, and it can get to be annoying in the winter months when they start closing in the patio to make it warmer."}
{"text":"My wife and I come to Sandbar all the time,  but it's not for the food or the bar (which are both disgusting) . Sat at the bar to have breakfast and watch part of the game Sunday. Bar tender gal handed us plates the had some type of brown juice floating in them. I showed her, and she said gross and apologized. I asked for a box to take the rest of my cold potatoes and burrito home in and the same juice was in that container too. What are the chance? Flies everywhere on the sticky bar. Sure I have a lot of check ins here, buts it's for the $4 margaritas and people watching, during happy hour then we race home to shower. Waitresses are always good. We've never had a problem with any of them. I only recommended this place for a drink and some chips and salsa and people watching. If you want any type of decent food go somewhere elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can't really give it 3 stars.  I started to but there's more wrong with this place than right.  Others have complained about the poor staff.  The staff was fine and service was good so we didn't have anything to complain about there.  What we didn't like was more.  To begin with the seats are very uncomfortable.  Most of them are on tall wood stools without backs.  Some of the tables are on concrete and some are on the sand.    Then, there was the menu.  It's really different.  There really is a variety but we didn't think the menu was enough to call it a Mexican grill and that's what we were looking for ... Mexican food.    The red sauce on the enchiladas was pretty spicy and tasted a little burnt.  The pulled pork sandwich was also pretty spicy and nothing on the menu indicated that it was spicy. I can definitely tell you it was.  We were actually quite disappointed with the food and there's no reason we would return."}
{"text":"Great happy hour place for fun and relaxation for co-workers .  It is pricey if you go before happy hour starts.  They occasionally have live music too if that is your bag (not mine).  But not bad for being located in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Recently just moved to the Desert Ridge area....Sandbar has become our favorite \"local bar\". Although the place is quite large, it has a great casual atmosphere with a friendly staff! The Happy Hour is great with drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers! The Taco's are muey good!! Great place to watch your favorite sports teams, plenty of TV's with great views from any seat! On the weekends, they add in a DJ and a dance floor!  I love being to throw on my favorite jeans and t-shirt and be able to head out for a night out at Sandbar!"}
{"text":"The food is average at this location but the reason they receive one star is the waitress Tamara deliberately ignored serving our group and when approached she indicated that another group walked out on her and she was attending that, however she never came back but continued serving others around us. This was not a great experience at all..."}
{"text":"Cover was $10($6 for women) to get into the place.  It was a nice set up, didn't realize you could eat there, and I don't think I would want to, it was so loud.  The attire that the bartenders and servers were wearing just seemed out of place.  Hardy meets Guns n'Roses. And the girls with the clip on bows in their hair..what's the point!    Drinks ..not cheap and not that strong.  We went \"outside\" in the patio area and just got a vodka and 7up and a beer..a Coors beer, it was $14..seriously and for a Coors!    Needless to say, I don't think Sandbar will last."}
{"text":"The Sandbar is always fun...its lively and full of spirit. You'll see a variety of ages which is a plus. The food is mediocre and the margaritas need some work but its definitely a fun place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Hey! It's Wednesday! What luck! Half of craft beer! More reviews to come on this place! I've found a bar in here with helpful friendly staff. I'll be back!... Bonus motorcycle parking!  Recent visits during prime time have reminded me that I am old enough to be the father of most of the clientele. Fun to watch but reminds me that I'm old as dirt. Heh."}
{"text":"The service was awesome! The bartender knows how to make customer happy with their cocktails! wink..wink.. I love the green salsa/ salsa verde instead of red salsa, taste too garlic-y to me :)."}
{"text":"After ordering drinks, we asked for food and the guy didn't put in our order... asked him when he brought checks around where our food was and he goes, \"I forgot.\" What the hell? Haha who does that and wants a good tip? I guess not this guy... because I \"forgot how to tip\" properly. Enjoy that $1.50 and find another job, dude! I tip bartenders better than that for one drink  his loss, AMC's gain because I had to buy food from them instead. Sandbar loss money- not just their terrible server!"}
{"text":"I was shocked at how packed this place was on a Tuesday night. Maybe because it is Fat Tuesday and the Mexican-esque bar was celebrating Mardi Gras? Whatever, just a reason to party and the bar to make money I guess. But. I was not impressed. Nope. We were here for Happy Hour, which I didn't think was that great, although the $2 Taco Tuesday deal was pretty sweet. Unfortunately, that's all the tacos were worth, no way I'd pay full price. Plus, the service was terribly lousy. Our server was very impersonal. I suppose if you want to come here to only drink and dance on a Saturday night that'd be cool, but not if you want to just meet up after work with some friends. Whatevs."}
{"text":"Bar area has nice seating outside (with heaters and real sand). It has much more ambience than inside the restaurant. When we sat down outside I wasn't too sure about the service. Had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to come by our table and no one was sure who our waitress was but things quickly improved. Fun happy hour from 3 to 7 with all appetizers 1/2 price and drink specials. We had 2 orders of  the queso dip we liked it so much. Shrimp tacos are unique and a \"must try\". Maybe a little younger crowd but fun for all ages."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...I guess I will start by saying that Sandbar Desert Ridge has lost a customer and the 12 people that came to celebrate my Birthday. I reserved a table for Super Bowl Sunday which was my Birthday on 02/01/15. My first issue was walking up to the door of Sandbar and the lady saying that there was a $5 cover charge. I tell her that I have a reserved table and wasn't told that I have to have a $300 minimum on top of a $5 PER PERSON cover charge. She says we just decided to charge a cover charge BUT it will be deducted from your tab. I say ok since it will be deducted. (Issue #1)  When I called and talked to Justin the \"VIP Host\" over a week prior to my Birthday he asked me how many people am I expecting...I said probably 8-10 and he said ok. He never mentioned the amount of chairs allotted per table. I get there as planned at 2pm on Sunday and the table is all the way in the corner in the back. Barely no one was at the other reserved tables yet so I ask to move tables. I guess the waitress felt like she needed Justin \"The VIP Host\" and he comes over and doesn't say hello or nothing just goes into NO YOU CANT MOVE TABLES and I told you over the phone that the tables seat 6. I said No, you didn't and he proceeds to say yes he did. (Issue #2) So, I notice my attitude turning the wrong direction on my birthday so I decide to let it go. Also, had we left he would have still charged me for the $300 minimum on my credit card. I was pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place. So, I let it go and proceed to enjoy my Birthday. The staff was super slow. Justin the \"VIP Host\" was super rude. Oh yea, so as I am leaving to my car the waitress runs me down talking about I have a tab for $50 and we didn't meet the $300 minimum. Now, between 12 people everyone's tab was well over $55 EACH how did we NOT hit the minimum? Plus, my guests bought my drinks so how did I have a $50 tab? Oh yea, the waitress once again ran and got Justin when she chased me outside and brought him to my car because I told her once again that the lady at the door said that all of the cover charges would b deducted from the tab. Justin told me that I wasn't told that and he is not talking to me anymore and turned his back to me. (Issue #3) My friend just ended up paying for it but I will be calling today to talk to a Manager about all the discrepancies.  I have never been treated so horrible by a restaurant that should be catering to its customers. From the moment we walked in I was in a bad mood by the unprofessionalism of the staff at Sandbar Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour and a bright and fun atmosphere.  The staff is friendly, and you def feel like you are in a different world with all of the bright colors and sand around the bar outside."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for lunch last June. When I ordered my food, I told the server to leave off the guacamole because I'm highly allergic. The server told me she was allergic to guacamole too. When my food arrived the sour cream was so runny it oozed out of my burrito and down my arm. I was about to eat my second half of my burrito but decided to use my fork so I wouldn't get sour cream all over..... Um, there was no sour cream, instead there was a large amount of GUACAMOLE that I'm highly ALLERGIC to. Good thing I hadn't taken a bite, or I would have ended up in the emergency room."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch on a Saturday with my daughter and small grandsons. It took forever for our server to come to our table. There were several female severs standing around the bar area socializing, nothing else. Our server finally arrived after about 15 minutes. Took another 10 minutes to bring us our ice tea and water, which both tasted very bad. Our drinks were never refilled once. After being there for 40 minutes how much longer it would take our food because we were in a hurry. All of the plates and silverware were dirty... Blahhhh....When our burritos finally arrived, they were soaked in grease... GROSS!!!! I wouldn't ever come back here even if I was paid!"}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I decided to come here on a Thursday at around 2:30pm for happy hour. We're frequent happy hour goers and saw that they had great specials as it was ladies day (1/2 appetizers and drinks). We were very disappointed with our service. It took forever to get our drinks after we ordered. I received the wrong drink. When I spoke up I just got a blank stare and no apology. I did get the right drink eventually. Needless to say we finished our drinks and went onto somewhere else to finish our happy hour. We will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"Fun place, great food at a reasonable price. Great service. If you've not been, go on a Saturday or Sunday, you will have a lot of fun."}
{"text":"SO, my first experience at Sandbar is as follows...I am out with my mom looking for a bite to eat for lunch...there are exactly 4 people in the entire place. It takes the hostess 15 min to seat us as she is so busy flaunting her A$$ in some servers direction who OBVIOUSLY is NOT interested as he keeps looking away and walking off in another direction....ok ok, so we finally get seated. It now takes our server 10 min to actually come over and take our drink order. Another 10 min to bring it back.It proceeds like this until we actually were begging for our check to pay and get the heck out...reminder there are only 4 people in the entire place... the food was awful, the drinks sucked hard, and the services was BOGUS....  2nd experience.....AHWATUKEE COUGARS. Need I say more. Absolutely AWFUL...I wanted to bludgeon my eyes out and run screaming into the road.   I feel sorry for the local 21 and up's trying to have fun getting humped by the cougars. EEEEWWWWWWW.....I will never go back."}
{"text":"Disappointment and didn't even get to try the food which I was super excited to try. We were going to go for the first time SuperBowl Sunday because we are not from here and wanted a place to watch the game and have some good food. Every time we pass it its super busy and seems like a great place. Today we walked in and a nice lady asked where we wanted to sit while a lady next to her was on the phone, the lady got off the phone and stated that there is a $300 per table today. I informed her that I called earlier (for this exact reason) and asked if their was going to be a cover or additional cost today because it was Super Bowl and I was informed that their was not. She stated with a additude that they had just decided it because they are getting so many reservations. $300 for a small round table that fits 2 people smh... we are getting ready to spend about $300 on food and drinks the entire time. Definitely not. We went across the parking lot to Majerle's and are happier here!"}
{"text":"Best experience I've had here. Rachel was an amazing bartender!!! Great personality, knew about craft beers ( on 1/2 price craft beer day) and was just a great wait person in general. I think I'll be back again next Wednesday. Especially, if Rachel is tending bar on the patio !"}
{"text":"Came here for My friend's bachelorette party the night before her wedding. We asked 6 times for water and we got no water until my friend is about to throw up over their rail. Not happy. Otherwise okay service. Our girl came around every hour but we still never got our water."}
{"text":"Meh. That's all I can really say about Sandbar. I stopped in when I first moved to Phoenix in 2014 and thought it was a chill bar. I really liked the beach vibe it had and the large outdoor area covered in sand really emphasized that. There was good music playing, lots of people dancing outside and overall the vibe was pretty fun. Now fast forward 2 years and I'm wondering what happened to this place. There is no more sand in the outdoor area! How is it called SANDbar when there is no sand? Sadness and sorrow. Also, there seems to be no more dancing outside, and instead is relegated to the tiny dance floor inside. Not many people like to dance here, which would be great for me except the music is not that great. There was a string of slow, not fun songs playing when finally one great song comes on! The DJ then proceeds to cut it off and continue playing bad music.   I don't know what has happened in two years but the Sandbar I went to recently was not how I remembered it. To top it all off, there is a cover charge and the drinks get fairly pricy. Not worth it if the vibe of the bar isn't the greatest. I don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location with a rather large party, part of a corporate gig. I am going to state up front that I did not sample any of the food, at all, so if you're looking for input on that front, you definitely should seek another review.  With that said, I am instead going to give my $.02 on the rest of my experience. We were based on the patio along with the rest of our group, and had the large gazebo and several tables reserved for our employees. Not a bad setup, in fact I thought the decor and the layout was actually well done. What's not to like about having a gazebo that leads down to patio with beach sand and surfboard-shaped tables with umbrellas? The patio also featured those enormous fans that have to be about seven feet square, so there was plenty of respite from the Phoenix afternoon heat. They even have retractable sun (and wind) blocking curtains on the west side, which they roll up after dusk to make the space more open, which ups the cool factor. I dug the ambiance and the look, the central bar on the outdoor patio is definitely cool, and the space is pretty well laid out. Even our large group was able to congregate without too many gridlock issues.   Nevertheless, there are some issues that prevent me from giving a higher rating. First, there's the live music. I don't know where they found these guys, but they sucked. I realize it was mid-week and I'm not expecting headliners, but if you're going to subject your patio guests to tone-deaf musical acts, especially a pair of numbskulls that can't play their guitars worth of shit, at least have the good grace not to pump the volume up (there are speakers everywhere, not just at the stage) to the point where it deafens everyone. I literally had to scream at the people I was talking to, and some of them still couldn't hear me enough to understand what I was saying. The fact that the music was so ridiculously loud also means that everyone trying to get a word in edgewise with their companions is screaming at the top of their lungs to out-shout the band, which just magnifies the entire noise problem. Not really your ideal situation for a corporate gig where you're trying to network and get to know people, is it?  This kind of brings me to the second point, which is the clientele in this place. I have yet to visit an establishment with so many douche bags, wanna-be thugs and stupid, trashy looking women. I lost count of the guys wearing sunglasses after dark, displaying tribal tattoos on their biceps or sporting more jewelry than the average woman. Speaking of women, talk about the bottom of the barrel. I realize I'm in Scottsdale, but are there no decent women? I didn't spot a single one in there that didn't repulse me on sight. Lots of fatties and tarted up older broads, to put it mildly.   The service was great and they took exceptionally good care of our group, as I'm sure they want repeat business, but it's just not enough to make me go back. Maybe in another part of town with a better class of customer and with some better music (or even none!), this place would be a real draw for me, but as is, where is, I'm only going back if I'm invited on someone else's dime."}
{"text":"Really like this place little far from home for me but enjoy it! Little crazy at times super crowded."}
{"text":"This place has a fun ambiance. I was in from out of town. I enjoyed the outdoor patio. The mini chimichangas were very good. I did NOT enjoy the people smoking cigarettes. There shouldn't be smoking allowed near people eating. Patio or not, it should be a designated area far from anyone with food."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting dynamic!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm and the party was just getting started!  Enjoyed some cold beer and great guacamole with friends and snuck out before the 10pm crowd arrived. Overall a fun place!"}
{"text":"I love their grilled chicken nachos!  If you miss college and that bar that smells like the floor boards are soaked in beer, this is the place to head.  It's a fun environment for the men because there are games playing on a bunch of giant tvs."}
{"text":"It feels like Sandbar has been at Desert Ridge forever and a day and I finally gave it a try. We had put our name on the list for Barrio Queen which had more than an hour wait on a Saturday night (ugh). We had our 5 year old with us, so a bar isn't exactly what we had in mind but decided to go see if it was kinda kid friendly..it was!  Kid menu was great and our server was really nice at making sure my daughter had what she liked in her meal. It was early enough where there were still plenty of families there and didn't feel like we were the weirdos with a kid at a bar.  The music was great and it was loud-perfect for our kiddo who was dancing in her seat.   My steak burrito was wonderful and my husband's tacos were also great."}
{"text":"Really like this place for fight night lots of tv's and lots of beers on tap. Great ambiance and lots of energy. Would recommend this place for fight and NFL NBA games all the time."}
{"text":"This place sucks , the service is shitty , the food is terrible & and when the bouncers aren't allowing underage girls in at night , they are being cock blockers to the paying customers there to have a good time. Take into account the \" dress code \" which is only enforced if you are not a \" regular \" and one must deduce that this place is perfect for Scottsdale because it's packed full of phonies"}
{"text":"So I wrote a bad review last week about the Sandbar. Not to take away from the experience of mine which was not good; after the words of a friend I decided to do a re-write: which I have never done.   I have to say I have been there several times before and have not had a bad experience. Additionally, those I had lunch with that day had no complaints whatsoever and stated the server they have had previously and always has been good.   Also, the AGM did actually contact me and apologized for the experience and offered to buy me lunch.   So a week later, here is my objective non-hungry or quick tempered review.   The food I did have was good. John enjoyed his chicken burrito and Jen along with other coworkers all were very satisfied.  Thursdays  ladies get half prices apps and drinks which is pretty much the draw every week.   The whole experience wasn't perfect but one mistake does not dictate disaster. Like I said I have been here for other occasions and at other times of day and have found it to be a very fun and relaxing place.   I won't promise all my future reviews to be full of hugs and kisses but they will be more well tempered."}
{"text":"After a morning of volunteering with one of my girlfriends, we decided to come here because its her favorite place and I wanted to see what this place was all about.  I really liked the interior.  It was decorated nicely and had a nice tropical feel to it.  They have colorful lights on the patios, and the walls are painted in a variety of different colors.  Its very festive in here!  We were seated immediately and our service was wonderful.  Drink refills were a bit on the slow side, BUT the service was personable and good overall.  I went with an appitizer becuase even though I was hungry, they seem to have larger portioned dishes here, and didnt want to be overwhelmed with an enormous about of food.  The main entrees tend to run about $10 on average, and they have appitizers with smaller portions for a little bit less.  Being that I was starving, but not wanting a humungous portion I couldnt finish, I stuck with the appitizer.  Food was tasty, and we also were given chips and 2 types of salsa dips to go with them.  Chips were warm and tasty as well.  You can also sit out and eat on the patio, but we opted to sit inside and enjoy the AC.  I would gladly return here for happy hour, dinner with friends or dates for that matter."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place after soccer games nearby.  The food and service are fine.  It feels a bit like a hooters, with a mexican vibe, something we could not tell just from looking at it and for how tired we are we could not care.  If you are looking for a frat part in north phoenix, this is it.  I saw their own drunk bus parked out back"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been here 3 times in last 6 months and we were pleasantly surprised each time. As someone mentioned is a previous review, the hostesses were very lame. Not engaging and seemed like they didnt want to be there. But each time our waitresses were cc'd very friendly and attentive. The chips/salsa are free and a generous portion. We ordered fajitas and they were delivered quickly and hot. The waitresses were attentive and there are TVs all over the place. Pricing was fair. Some places charge too much for alcohol but the Sandbar does not. We haven't been there late but I'm sure its jumping! We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I not sure what is worse.  Bad service, or no service at all. However,  taking a look at all the other reviews it seem the vast majority of complaints about this place. All revolve around their bad service, or lack thereof anything resembling service.  Today, when I arrived with a group for a business meeting, we found ourselves waiting for a long time for anyone to come over, we eventually had to flag someone over to us.  The kicker was, we had to do it many times before the \"hostess\" (don't say waitress,  it seems they get offended by it) came over.  Once there, she lied to us. Saying, that we needed to wait to get seated, and that the place we had decided to seat our ourselves at, is a $200 reserved table. Yeah, I did not buy that. Especially seeing that this place is not exactly a high end restaurant and the table was located outside in the baking Sun.  My boss decided what the hell, he will pay the $200 and it should not be a issue, since nobody is using this table anyway. Instead of accepting the money, the awful and very rude waitress... Sorry I mean hostess, made it clear she's not accepting our money and walked away. And there we sat.  After, a few minutes we decided we're just gonna leave, seeing that we're not getting any service.   However, before we did, my boss and a fellow co worker went to talk with the manager and found out, that they do not reserve those tables and that we are allowed to see ourselves wherever we want.  I can only assume she had some kind of personal issue with us.   Anyway - The damage was done ."}
{"text":"Came in late, don't order food late. Tacos served with left over dried out meet. Seriously not eatable. Really can't believe they served it."}
{"text":"Cant believe these reviews! Sandbar is a Bar/Restaurant of course the music is going to be loud to put out the good vibes. The food is delicious! My group of friends & I have enjoyed ourselves here many of times. They have Happy Hour Everyday... Can't wait until football season they have 50+ HD TVs with awesome drink & food specials. See you all this weekend!"}
{"text":"Sand between my toes...tents with TVs...I don't care if it's by heavy traffic near the 101, this place knows how to deliver in the atmosphere department.  At night, Sandbar is a dance club. Not my type of scene, but despite the narrow space, this place gets packed. Yes, there will be some cute airheads. Pop your collar and walk right in!  During the day is when this place really shines. The $2 beers from 3-7 every day, along with the $5 appetizers is just great. Between slamming some Dos Equis, my friends and I enjoyed some miniature chimis and some tasty calamari. Their appetizers come out so fast, I almost had to question if they were made in advance. They were far too hot for that!  There are some entrees on the menu, but I'm sure they're on part with Chili's or a similar restaurant chain. Nothing about the food is fancy, but it won't be gross, either. This is as close to the beach as you're gonna get in this Phoenix."}
{"text":"The place was pretty large, meaning that there was plenty of elbow room.  There's sand on the floor for the outside and a wading pool for the hot days.  There are many private areas in this bar, so if you wanted a private party (sort of), it'd be a good place.  A wide range of music is played here, with music videos played for the songs.    Kind of cool, there are seats at the bar, stools with tables for high seating, couches, restaurant style seating, it's a place for everyone.  I wish I got on the dance floor, but I was talking to my friend I haven't seen in years!"}
{"text":"Always good food, the waitress did tell us that because they've gone \"corporate\" they had to change their salsa.  That was disappointing because I really liked their old style better.  Drinks are very well poured and atmosphere is always a blast."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Came here for a bday shindig but was way more captivated by the Chargers game. There were plenty of tvs which I very much appreciated. The staff was attentive wo being annoying. Drinks were cheap and crowd was not too shabb. This would be a fun spot for Sunday football as well. Not sure if you need to pay for the cabanas.. But it's a pretty cool concept. Would def come back"}
{"text":"I don't get to make it over to this side of town very often, but when I do I always try to stop in to the Sandbar.   All Sandbar's are set up the same inside and out, mini pool by the from entrance, sand around the bar outside, private cabanas, and dance floor inside. The dance floor at this one is a bit bigger than the one in Scottsdale I think which is nice.   They have tons of specials all the time, great DJ, and usually get the UFC and Boxing fights on pay-per-view. The staff is awesome and always takes care of everyone. They also through a pretty awesome party for Cinco De Mayo, with live bands and contests.   If you are over their you should defiantly stop in, have some fish taco's and a corona and tell Kelly that Aimee H. sent you! :-)"}
{"text":"Thought of starting at Zipps  ... Über driver was like no try Sand Bar. Despite AWFUL REVIEWS during the last 6 mos, still tried it out  stars based on at bar service 4\5 because no one is perfect then Le boyfriend  was like but what's holding your from a 5/5 and truth be told maybe a previous Yelp review ... I was afraid to try the food ... Nonetheless Ask for Sean he's the bomb. legit. Attentive. Speedy. And aware. What more can you ask for in a bartender?! Bucket of chips green salsa very Limey red salsa more traditional and very delicious not to mention 3.00 hefen on Wednesday... with no hoppy after taste. 4 peaks light ale ... Try it, ask for Sean the end *****mic drop****"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun.  I guess.  And my chips and wings were good.  My comrades tell me the honey jalapeño wings were too hot,  there was sweating, runny noses, and tears, but I dug them.  I like it hot! But service was slow all night and not very attentive.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Went last night for a birthday celebration. Terrible food and horrible service. Guacamole was good, other than that it was nasty. I ordered coconut shrimp appetizer and the shrimp (all 4 of them) had half the shells on. I bit into that and got disgusted.  I got up twice to find our server because she she was ignoring us. I heard they are struggling and now I know why."}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way back to Tucson. We had a party of 4. My mom and I ordered a peach and strawberry margarita. Their frozen machine wasn't on all the way so they gave us our slushy margaritas on the house - greatly appreciated!  As for the food, it was pretty good. We tried the chicken enchiladas, carnitas tacos, and carne asada tacos. Very generous portion sizes.   After we were finished with our food, our server disappeared. I could see her chatting with her friends. My mom let her know we were ready for the check when she passed her on the way to the restroom. She continued to talk to her server friends so I finally had to walk up and just give her my card.   All in all, it was a pretty good experience except for the last part."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I have high expectations of Mexican food. This place is legit. The food is so good. We've been here 3-4 times now over the past year. And here's the reason why the reviews aren't that great: the service. It's not all that grand. The servers and bartenders are pretty young and they just give that amazing service you get at some restaurants. Although, I don't care. My order comes out at a decent time frame, they always have great specials, and they've never given us the wrong order. So, in general, do I feel like I'm the most important person to my server? No. But I don't really care. It's not that important to me. I just care about good food, and cold beer. So it gets 5 stars in my books!!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to socialize with friends, drink, and dance. Like most bars, drinks can be a little pricy but if you don't want to spend money on alcohol then stay home!   The food is a weak attempt at Mexican cuisine. The only thing I like eating there are the tacos on Tuesday.   Like many others I think the dress code is ridiculous. Why are guys not allowed to have stickers on their hats? Seems a little silly to me!   The staff is horrible. I almost always see the female servers flirting with the tables that have only men but neglect to check on my table when it's me and my boyfriend. The male servers are no better. One guy even said he would rate my friend and I as 'sevens'. I'm sorry but I don't go out to a bar for the staff to degrade me as a human being. I have no idea who he was or why that comment was even made. But after that I have not enjoyed going there as much.   The only thing I really enjoyed about this place is they sent out coupons for free beer. I loved using the coupon since no purchase was required."}
{"text":"Great margaritas! I recommend the frozen strawberry, or the Chambord margarita on the rocks.  Food is your typical mexican bar food, nothing spectacular. Women beware! The sandy floor gets annoying in your shoes! However, it is part of the atmosphere (SAND bar).   The lines and waiting at this place are absolutely absurd on the weekends. There is a cover for men after 10pm but women are free. The music is good, the atmosphere fun, but if there ends up being a ridiculous wait, you'll find the exact same thing at San Felipes in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Food is not great. Staff is not very bright. I don't go here unless I'm meeting people who picked this spot. There are other venues with better patios. I wouldn't bother eating here, just have a drink and then go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Love the area, the property, the ambiance, etc. the service her is pretty terrible. I have been here plenty of time and on most occasions it's quite empty when I come for drinks. I've sat at tables for 15-30 mins without being waited on, bartenders are quite rude, etc. if it weren't for those two issues that I've had so far this place would be fun.   Aside from these issues, I recommend coming here. It's a fun place on Friday and Saturday nights, but other nights it kinda sucks.   Give it a try and see what comes of it. Not every night is the same."}
{"text":"Came to watch the UFC fight.  Had a few beers, appreciate the complimentary chips and salsa.  Seems like it would be a much more enjoyable place to be when it's a bit warmer out.  I will try to visit again after the winter passes."}
{"text":"This place has good food but it is what it is. It's a bar for rowdy people with that hip live retro music. Assume that based on the attire of the staff they want a desired effect."}
{"text":"Came in with some friends the other afternoon and the food was great! Can never go wrong with the chimichanga. Also, our server, Summer, was pleasant fun and tentative to our party's needs. Awesome atmosphere. Feels like mexico. (In a good way) We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"No Thanks!   Happy Hour specials are not that great, and definitely not worth waiting a long time while sitting at the bar and there are 5 bartenders fiddling their thumbs. Definitely not good to have 3 bartenders in an hour period and then when tabbing out the 3rd bartender cops an attitude b/c we cant remember if we already paid for one or two of our drinks, considering we were asked to tab out 10 mins into our 1st drink!   Food is less than average, WHERE is the flavor???  The staff seemed completed LOST! No thanks!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The food was bad. The service was PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW. Drink refills? No chance. They appeared to have plenty of servers and the place wasn't that busy.   Don't waste your money, there are plenty of better options in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously, you would think a bar with a cool beachy theme and a nice patio would be a no brainer in Arizona. Sadly, this place has disappointed me. I have been here twice and I'm still unimpressed. Drinks are ok, but I would expect a little more alcohol in my drink- my vodka tonic tasted mostly like tonic. Also, I think I'm generally on the younger side of the crowd here, and I felt slightly out of place. Not trying to offend, and I know its in chandler, but one Saturday night I went, and I swear the average age was 35-40. Its ok for happy hour, but there are certainly better places to go."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Probably the most fun \"in the area\". I've come here and had a good time but I've never stayed incredibly long. The crowd is mixed but I usually see milfs and dilfs which is fine until they get drunk. It's pretty entertaining though, last time I was here with a couple friends and we got to watch an older couple go at it with lots of tongue. Although that was the highlight of that night, it was also our cue to leave. Another time I went here you could tweet the DJ to play a request, my bf got a song played and it was exciting but then they went back to playing annoying house music and drove me off the dancefloor. I would recommend if you're in the area but I always end up leaving and going somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the Sandbar Mexican Grill up at Desert Ridge. We had a Groupon that expired on 1/29/2012 and decided to go on a Friday night to use right after Happy Hour (7pm) The place was crowded, but we got lucky to find a place right away outside, next to a fireplace. We were also lucky enough to have a GREAT waitress that served us, Paulina M. She was on top of everything and had no issues taking our Groupon which was a $40 value that we purchased for $20. That got us 2 margarita's and 2 entree's. We had some smooth margarita's, the house marg was good as well as the sweet and smoky marg that I had. (Pineapple and chipotle) I had the beef enchiladas which were good. The guacamole that we got with our chips were good as well. Overall - an enjoyable experience! They could have had corn tortillas as an option ;-)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and SKIP SANDBAR.   It is honestly surprising to me that this place still stays in business. I don't say this because of one bad experience, I have been to Sandbar at least 10+ times and each experience is worse than the last.   Imagine a staff that is completely all in training and seems like they've all been fired from every last job they had. This is the staff at Sandbar. They are all unorganized, rude, and do not know what customer service is. The bartenders don't know any drinks. One time I ordered 4 Washington Apples and the bartender made some sort of Pineapple drink and when I brought up it was the wrong drink, she said \"well I thought what your ordered was gross, so I made you this instead.\"   Management is even worse. For my brother's birthday we bought a $500 cabana. My brother was kicked out because \"he was drunk.\" I'm sorry but I don't know very many people who go to a bar and stay sober. My brother was perfectly fine, wasn't rude to anybody, wasn't mean to staff or was an unpleasant presence at Sandbar. When I approached the manager about this, he was so rude and unpleasant to deal with.   This has to be by far the worst place inside of Desert Ridge. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Service tonight not so good waitress walked past our table several times my wife even had to walk to the bar and ask her for water. Chips were very salty and the tacos were too. A customer brought in his dog which I don't agree with the new aged so called service dog. More true a pet then the waitresses and make wait staff petted the dog! Who polices sanitary practices in this establishment should be looking for another place to work..."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, and good quick bites! Good happy hour deals. Warm atmosphere with friendly staff"}
{"text":"Straight up a 3. No complaints about the food, but it's really nothing to write home about. Sandbar is much more a bar than a restaurant. To call it a Mexican restaurant is generous as the menu is very limited, with only the very basic Tex Mex items being offered. Service was fair. Our waitress made no secret of the fact that she was very busy. Also, there was no host/hostess, so we seated ourselves and just waited for a waitress to appear. She asked for our order when we didn't even have menus! Being mostly a bar, Sandbar is extremely loud, so don't go looking for an intimate evening or even to have a conversation with your fellow diners. The music is loud, but good. Definitely a place to go for a fun night out."}
{"text":"I love walking into a restaurant setting that makes me feel like I'm on vacation. The big colorful Hawaii picture on the wall, the outdoor tables with sand under the feet, the open bar with patron bottles hanging as lamps - the place just looks like fun!   My husband and I were early birds - we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday. The place was not that busy - we chose a pub table by the bar. Our server brought us menus and walked us through all the drink choices, which I love. I decided on the pomegranate margarita and my husband got the Diablo. My drink was extremely sweet and I couldn't taste the tequila. If the entire review were based on my drink, it would get one star. The Diablo, however, was so yummy - a lightly sweet cocktail with a spicy aftertaste - it was so good my husband had two of them.   We ordered four appetizers, which was a lot of food. (1) The steamed mussels in ancho chili sauce were AMAZING - we wanted to lick the plate clean. (2) The calamari was underwhelming - deep fried and rubbery w/ an overly sweet chili sauce. (3) The steak quesadilla was yummy, but they didn't provide enough guacamole, salsa or sour cream for the entire dish - it seemed like there was some serious rationing going on. (4) The coconut prawns were lonesome - four little guys, fried to death, sat on a very large place with more of the same sauce from the calamari.    Our server was over-attentive. She stopped by about every five minutes to see how we were doing. It drove us both a little nuts, but she was really nice, which made up for the constant checks.   Total cost of 1 margarita, 2 diablos, 1 beer and four appetizers: $75. (I think for the cost/value ratio, I am better off across the street at Z' Tejas.)  I feel like this place has the potential to be very great if they could just change up a few things. Don't over-fry things, add some variety to the sauces (maybe chipotle mayo for calamari?), don't ration guacamole and sauces, and don't give me super sweet drinks with a splash of tequila and call it a margarita."}
{"text":"A Mex restaurant in the Desert Ridge area. I was very unimpressed with my $15 shot of Azul Blanca clear, the tequila out of this one bottle had 'Zero Alcohol Burn.' I could compare the shot to a strong glass of water. My $7 well Margs were OK.   I just finished with a client and was happy to leave."}
{"text":"The place is nice and has a cool young atmosphere vibe. The employees were kind and fast. But the food itself was just subpar. The tacos are nothing special. You can get equal food at the Taco Bell. For the price it isn't worth it. Just look around for a better Mexican grill in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with Clients from out of state kinda by accident. Was supposed to go someplace else (which none of us could find) and somebody called and said *I'm in front of Sandbar, lets just go here* We all agreed! Not any of our usual tastes but it was OK. Did not have a rude waitress, the front desk girls was pleasant, the drinks were good and the food delish! And there was loads of food! Big portions! A Sports Bar, a little loud at times during the game, had to yell a few times across our table conversing. The only thing i did not like was after the bill was paid, NOTHING! Not even water!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my first visit here. The guys at the door were cocky. Our waitress was not helpful at all. My friend and I both ordered margaritas. After ordering, our waitress disappeared. Our drinks were the worst and expensive. We tried explaining to our server that we weren't satisfied and she showed no remorse. I don't plan on returning to Sandbar Desert Ridge again."}
{"text":"I'm all about realistic expectations. That said, I'm fairly certain for a 70+ dollar bill I got Filibertos food and service. Hell, I kinda like Filibertos to hit the spot sometimes, but at least they charge me accordingly. I've had better food at Taco Bell to be honest.  I suppose if you're stuck in Ahwatukee/Chandler and don't want to Lyft it somewhere decent, this place will give you tiny margaritas and you can get your suburban rocks off. That's about all I can recommend, though. I'm pretty sure management counts on your inebriation to rank this place any higher than two stars. Just remember when you're picking the fake beach sand out your hair the next morning: this place is shyte.   Our orders: beef chimi, queso, cheese enchiladas, kids menu, various mixed drinks. Beef chimi was ok, rice and beans standard bland fare. Queso is an embarrassment (personal best: Salty Senorita on a good day; Roaring Fork)  Our service: took too long on a really slow day. We could see food sitting under the heat lamps which turned out to be ours, had to call out service to get it.   That One Redemption: Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Margaritas here are just about the worst thing outside of a free shot of what seemed to be gasoline after the Cubs won the World Series.  In no way should 'best' be associated with this drink.  If you adore having smoke infiltrate your food and general experience... knock yourself out. The entire place smells like an ash tray.  You get one star for the bean dip. Only redeeming quality."}
{"text":"Way too loud and is more of a club than a patio bar. I would go to dos gringos before going here. There was no order on seating people down which is odd when you have a sign that can flip around and give order in the establishment. First and last time I will ever be there. Wish the place the best."}
{"text":"Picked up a friend that was stranded there. Seems to be your typical \"Poser, Meat Market, and Look at Me\" establishment. There were all kinds there, from youngsters, to Tommy Bahama old men hanging out. It was early 9pm and the place was filled up. Music was good, drink (soda) was taste, and I was in and out in about 15 minutes. Not sure when I will be back, as this is not really my scene...been there done that years ago!"}
{"text":"Kelley is Awesome. I gave her a text as we rolled up, we were met at the door, and cruised in with no cover. This place was popping! Not really my thing anymore...too young, and too much volume (not the music, just the flow of drinks and people). We went to the bar and right as we were ready to order, a young woman asked me what my name was, I said Toby, and she replied to her friend to her left...It is him! Crazy I knew her friend from 10 years earlier. She goes remember me, I said yes, married to Andre, 2 kids, and nice to see you again. She replied, Divorced, Andre is an asshole, and great to see you again. We met up with Kelley again in the sand, by the water, to hook her up with a shot for being so cordial. Like I sais...not my scene any longer. My buddies had some good drinks, we left one there, and we moved on. Overall it was good. We had a few tacos from the taco dude, they were very taste at 12am."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight at this restaurant worse customer service I have ever had. Ordered a frozen drink off the happy hour menu. Get the bill the drink is double the price it should be. Waitress say she just found out that drink wasn't covered for happy hour. Assistant manager comes over and has an attitude doesn't comp or adjust price and doesn't care. Had to end up paying 8 dollars for a frozen drink that should have been 4 on the happy hour menu. Will not be back and will tell all my friends not to come here!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience...It's a bar... not a place to eat IMO. Fun atmosphere...security needs to loosen up a bit but other than that can't complain."}
{"text":"I'd give this zero stars if I could. Went there to listen to a band, the flyer promoted a $5 cover. When I arrived they were charging $20. No one would honor the original price, even though others in my group who had arrived a few minutes before me were only charged $5. All I was given were excuses. Nowhere on the post was a time limit. I even heard the bouncers tell people in line that the price goes up the more people arrive! Needless to say, you got my 20 because the band was worth seeing, but I didn't and will never spend another penny here. Horrible attitudes from the 'manager' on down."}
{"text":"Love this place for girls night we always ask for nick he's or waiter. The have DJ's and great girl night deals on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices!  Great weather!  Sit outside at the bar!  Bartenders work their butts off!  Love this place.  Whitney and Taylor and Crespin great job!"}
{"text":"I like this bar. It always has a hopping outdoor tropical bar-vibe. It has decent energy but not overly high energy like a happy medium between a corner dive bar and a crazy college bar. My coworkers always seem to pick this place for HH and the drinks are decent. The chambord margarita is a little better than average, kind of like the Z Tejas one."}
{"text":"The fun factor starts when you walk in the door! The colors and the ambience are incredible! The food tasty and the service over the top. I'll be back again and again! Mahalos to Justin, you made our evening very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Will I am never ever coming here again, which is probably what they wanted anyway? So I applaud you, you've won, you have one less ni99a coming to your establishment. Well done.  It just sucks that the security guard who I thought was nice who saw me limping my way up the ramp holding the rail and he heard me say while he was checking my ID that I just wanted to order some tacos and get the hell out of there. Which would have been the perfect time to tell me to limp back to my car and go elsewhere but no he let me limp to the bar only to be told the kitchen is closed and that a man will have some tacos that I guess he brings from home at 11:00 or so and basically I would have to wait an hour for some tacos on taco tuesday and shit it would be damn near wed before I could get some tacos???  Hahaha The bartender was ok i guess but the security guard who I thought had a cool vibe dropped the ball. My foot is killing me I know it's not the Sandbars fault but it just sucks that businesses don't take pride in basic fundamental customer service like they used to anymore. No one is perfect but with my basic common sense as soon as the customer states they want something that is unavailable everyone from the top down should be on the same page in order to keep the customer happy and be able to explain what the situation is. In short the damn security guard should have not let me walk extra in agony when he could have just told me the kitchen is closed at 10:00pm sorry no tacos for you buddy. At the end of the day this is petty but still worth a 1 star review if a lesson can be learned here. #ifeelsorryforthedisabled #especially #black #disabled #wegottadobetter #imisscustomerservice #justwantedtacos #terribletues #sadbar=sandbar #petty#2017"}
{"text":"Oh, it's ok I suppose.   It's one of those places that promises so much in the way of a great time that one can't help but be disappointed. Kinda like a cruise ship.  It also reminds me of what art critic Robert Hughes said about Las Vegas: \"The land of instant riches and perpetual orgasm\".    Party party party. Fun fun fun.  Anyway, they have bars and sell drinks and have Mexican food. The waitresses are young and cute.  Oh, and I do suspect -- as others here have suggested -- that many of the patrons are not entirely self-actualized and thus are not acting in a state of full existential freedom in attending this place.  In other words, they tend to be drunk and horny.  It also can be hard to find a place to park some nights.  And no, in fact I didn't get laid there, and that fact is probably weighing on this less-than-enthusiastic review. Thanks for asking!"}
{"text":"Horrible food   cold chips   everything looked a week old..   Floor was dirty    table was sticky    waitress was tediously slow and unfriendly.   The patrons were no better   loud mouthed yes necks trying to pick up trailer poon."}
{"text":"Update: what a difference a few weeks make.  I think it has a lot to do with your server.  Ours was not friendly.  It seemed she didn't have the time for us.  The food was the same.  We will probably take a few months off before we try again.  --------  Lots of fun and great service.  The hostesses were friendly.  Our server, Alissa, was on point the whole night.  Our drink glasses were never empty.  I recommend the fajitas, a mix of shrimp and steak.  Tacos are great too.  Afterward we went to listen to the band right thereat Desert Ridge Marketplace.  We had a great time."}
{"text":"For unknowing drivers that visit this bar..Please take a cab or have a driver when going here?  Peoria PD motorcycle units love hanging out just west of this location, you have been warned :) As for the grill it is not,  it is more bar than grill....So as long as you came here for drinks, hanging out, maybe dancing then its a great stop....Fish tacos, carne tacos, and beer.  Bar nachos and drinks sums it up.   I do remember visiting here when it first opened up and they required guys to tuck in shirts?!  Not the case anymore, but it did seem over populated with bouncers at first.  I think it has calmed down since then and the staff seem friendly now."}
{"text":"Fun times, strong drinks, good dance-y dance-y, and a chance to watch a Drunken Catfight.  Sandbar, you're far away, but I *will* be back.   Shoutout to DJ Statik and the Hostile crew.  ;)"}
{"text":"The patio here is the key and it is much larger than the original location in central Scottsdale. The crowd is definitely younger - at least on Friday after midnight it was. I have a feeling this would be a great place to watch a game and day-drink."}
{"text":"i must be easy vs the other reviews for the sandbar.  the nachos are great!!  i like both the chicken and beef.  i think i can eat that for the whole meal (i'll try that next time).  i had the carnitas tacos which comes in threes and thought there weren't anything special.  i had to try the rice which i regret.  so, i'll stick to the nachos and give it 4 stars for the service and nachos."}
{"text":"Drinks are on the high side. I guess they figure they are close enough to Scottsdale to get away with that.  Nobody in our group of 8 had any rave reviews on any of the food - I didn't eat any of it, so can't say.  It's louder than it needs to be - and I worked in the concert industry for a long time - so trust me on that front.  The waitstaff and bartenders are all on the adorable-to-hot scale, and our waitress was very efficient; so there's that going for them, but I won't be headed back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to Sandbar this afternoon. Sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes before the male bartender even acknowledged me. I asked for iced tea and a menu. My grilled mahi tacos were ok but not great, but I never saw the bartender again until I practically had to flag him down for my tab. The service here is so bad. Female bartenders only wait on men who are drinking beer. They don't make eye contact and won't even acknowledge the female patrons.  Sorry Sandbar, I'm not happy with your service and am sorry I wasted my time there."}
{"text":"Thursday night is ladies night with half-price appetizers and drinks so I usually come here with some friends for that. The food is mediocre, nothing great, nothing bad. The service is pretty terrible though. I went today and the waitress, Ashley, didn't bring our waters. After taking our order we never saw her again until someone had to go find her to get our checks. She never checked up on us, never asked for refills, nothing."}
{"text":"Very good Tuesday happy hour! 2.50 tacos! Very cozy outdoor bar.   Tried the Carne Asada, Mahi, and Shrimp and Mango Tacos and all made me and my tummy happy!   Staff was fast and courteous.  Easy parking."}
{"text":"Took a while for server to see us...however, she was very attentive after. This is a really fun place! No sand though, I guess they should call it brick bar now. I would not recommend the iceberg....sounds really cool, but it's a margarita that is poured into a beer, and not too tasty unless you like the taste of dish detergent....in which case, GO CRAZY!!!"}
{"text":"Not what I remembered the sandbar to be; terrible service, limited drink menu, over crowded seating area with age ranges not our own (50+ or 21), and bad music- too loud. Probably not come b"}
{"text":"Chill enough spot I guess. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes it is terrible. Sometimes the margaritas are tasty, sometimes they put a ridiculous amount of purée or syrup. Tacos are consistently tasty. So are the creepy old men and young douchebags that constantly visit. Then there is the issue with that fact that they took the sand out of SANDbar. Maybe too many drunk creepy people unable to walk on an uneven surface. Probably have been some pretty embarrassing/funny falls there. All in all this place is pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"It was okay.  Guacamole was good but the rest (I got the ground beef tacos and my wife got the taquitos) was okay.  Service was good."}
{"text":"First timer, but staff was attentive and food / drinks were real good. Sat at cabana bar and was taken care of very well. DJ was .. Umm... DJing I guess. Could take it or leave it. Plenty of mixed crowd that we're having a good time.   Bartender pours a stiff drink and that is always appreciated. Thanks for the interesting time."}
{"text":"New Sanbar on Ray Rd (near I-10; just east near Red Lobster & Lowe's).  Grand Opening 9/17/09.  Dropped by last night and they let us in as part of the \"Friends and Family\" pre-grand opening.  Nice place, roomy, great place to watch games; never been to Sandbar in Scottdale or other locations, but this will be a fun spot to frequent - nothing else like it along Ray Rd.  They gutted the old Bahama Breeze and this place is much better!  Food was good; drinks were good; friendly staff - the sand, pool all make it fun.  Big bars; good indoor seating; lots of parking.  Coconut shrimp are really good as an appetizer.  Lots of great HDTV's for game watching...no bad seats for viewing anywhere.  Should be a hit!  Looking forward to going back with some friends."}
{"text":"This bar is like no other bar in the Chandler area.  This is where you go on a Friday or Saturday night if you are into the party scene. The Sandbar has a strong beach theme; there is even a small pool with sand you can go in. It definitely emits a fun atmosphere.  However, this place lacks quality service.  My friends and I had several servers throughout the night and they all seemed pretty inadequate at their jobs.   Two drink orders were completely messed up and my husband's meal was supposed to come with chips and salsa, which was clearly stated on the menu, but the server insisted that it did not.  I watched our waitress spill almost every drink she walked past with.  I can tell they were all working hard, but they were just horrible at their jobs. On the bright side, the food was very good and the blueberry margarita was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. The GM is a complete dick. He kick me out because his buddies crashed out cabana we asked them to leave, they started to fight with us and we get kicked out. Screw this place and don't waste your money or your time at this place!!!!!!  Needless to say because of this we took our business elsewhere for a birthday party and had a better time."}
{"text":"Rude. Went in the wrong door, shouted at us like we were in first grade. Spend money else where."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. During the day and at night. The few times I have been here during the day was for lunch. The food is really good no complaints on the drinks. Service is really fast seeing how we sat at the bar and it really wasn't that busy, also it was happy hour I may or may not had a few $2 margaritas and amore than 2 $3 beers..... May or may not have.   Night time it turns into a club and it gets BUSY last time I was there it took a good 10 minutes to get from the entrance to the dance area mind you this place isn't really THAT big. It's a good time because everyone there is just there to have fun and dance. Everyone is friendly there. They have the grill going by the front with tacos, burgers etc.   Crowd is a mixture of pretty much everything age and nationality wise real diverse.  Nice place to go to if you're really not trying to head to old town or party with the kids on Mill.   Yes there is really sand in Sandbar... they have sand volleyball spot set-up inside.."}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY is the only time I've been here, I get Dos XX on draft and 3-4 tacos, service is always pretty good. I think their chips taste a tad stale, I know a lot of places serve chips like this, if you know On The Boarder, I like that style of chip. Always get them, just wish they where better. Younger-ish crowd, noisy atmosphere at times, not complaining, just maybe don't bring the grandparents., lol.  BEST atmosphere around for that \"Taco Tuesday\" feel."}
{"text":"Great location off of the 101.  Service was good  The price was great The food was not disappointing. The salsa is very good. The chimichanga was very tasty and my husband enjoyed the tacos.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"UNCERTAIN WHY I HAVE NEVER ENTERED THE SANDBAR BEFORE....  But I know I will be rolling through on Thursdays a little more often..  So my boy gets a end of School year thank you gift of a Gift Card... Blessing that would help ease the pain....  We Park to see Mist Systems chilling the air and the outside bar...(we will check out later without the kids).. Walk in to 2 welcoming faces, the ladies showed us to a table, got our drink order, we were going to order our usual Mexican fair, but decided to hear what was on Happy Hour and Thursday Special.... Little did we know  They had a Chicken Chimichanga  that was normally $11.99 for $5.99 so I thought, sounds cheap i will order 2 one for now and one for Lunch tomorrow (Thank god tomorrow came, I will be brutalizing that Chimi like it was its first night in prison...lol)  But I digress, so we order the Chimi and notice we are just in time for Happy Hour to close out, Waitress Explains that its also Ladies Night and Ladies get drinks HALF OFF...! BOOYAH! so they have A Magical Margarita Machine .... Boy was it Magic... Nice stuff by the way, so we find out why they only have one size.... Cause its all you need.  Food gets delivered and presentation is nice, drinks are on hand and we all dive in... Then the surprise of the Spicy Smokey Chicken in the crispy hand made deep fried tortilla. Needless to say it was off the Chain and the guacamole was on-point, and I recommend ordering the extra at $0.50 per cup.  Needless to say i only needed water, cause the Tequila was working its magic..   diner was a hit and we will be back, the burgers were of the Rock Bottom of Arrowhead before they fell off...  And leftovers....wow........round two of Bring the Joy and Pain...lol"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now from out of town. Both experiences have been great! The chips and salsa are tasty, I appreciate the clearly marked gluten free options and LOVE the happy hour deep eddy moscow mule. Our waiter (Wes) was awesome. Very attentive and helpful. I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped after working a saturday with my girl and her son for few drinks and wings. Always a good vibe at this spot."}
{"text":"My teenage son and I met my mom there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  We sat at the bar outside and enjoyed the very casual, laid back sandbar area.  We ordered the Carne Asada tacos, the Veggie tacos and the Mexican Cob Salad.    The great: The Veggie Tacos were phenomenal!!  I'm not even a huge veggie taco fan but they were crazy good.  Perfectly grilled and seasoned portobello shrooms, grilled peppers and onions, fresh guac and some sprouts on top - but the kicker was the \"tortilla\".  At first we thought it was a rice paper tortilla but then figured it out that it was simply an ultra thin slice of jicama!  How freakin' cool is that??  The salsa!  It was the best.... after our own homemade salsa.  Tasted fresh, had a smooth kick at the end with a great roasted flavor to it.  and the chips that came with it were crisp and thick.  The good: My salad!  Yummy mixed greens (real lettuce, not romaine or iceburg), roasted corn, jicama, tomatoes, paper thin shredded carrots, black beans....i had them hold the bacon.  But it was a great combo, good size and filling.  The OK:  The carne asado tacos were ok.  Nothing special.  There were 3 small flour tortillas with ok seasoned, ok cuts of steak.  If you wanted rice & beans it was an extra $3.  meh.  Overall - I would come back.  The food was an the upside of good and the ambiance is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Location is amazing.  Decor is great.  Food is amazing as well. Be sure to try the mussels I couldn't get enough of them. No better place to watch a game on the weekend while kicking back having a beer with friends. When the weather cools has to be one of the best patios in the valley.  Bravo Sandbar job well done!!!"}
{"text":"One of the few places I will go on the west side and, of course, I'm about to tell you why. First off, it's not at Westgate.  People have been shot and kill partying at Westgate.  Who wants to go there?  Not me.  I love my life!!   If you're headed to a Cardinals game and don't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a parking pass nor tailgate at Westgate where people die, you should go to the Sandbar.  There's free parking at the fancy Park West shopping center AAAAAAAND the fine folks at Sandbar will escort you in their bus over to stadium when you've had your fill of build your own bloody Marys and tacos.  Don't worry, they'll pick you up from the game and bring you safely back to your car. Speaking of the bus, if you live nearby, you can call and have them pick you up and take you home.  Now that's a classy bar.  They're concerned about your good time and safety. Depending on the night, or day, you go, you can totally get a different vibe.  Up for a crazy night of dancing?  Go on a Friday or Saturday night.  Feel like chillaxing on a patio?  Go during happy hour.  Feel like some karaoke?  There's a night for that too.  There's even great live music during Friday happy hour.  It's safe, friendly, the margaritas are strong, the vodka is well priced, the tacos are yummy... It's a good thing I don't live closer or else I'd probably never leave."}
{"text":"Great place on Tuesday for cheap tacos and beers.  The outdoor patio is awesome when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Only Sandbar that I go to. It's a pretty cool place. Friday nights are ok, but Saturday nights are packed and a lot more fun!"}
{"text":"I love James & Jenny!!! Best bartenders ever!!!!! TreAt me like a prize winning pony!!! Yay!!!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for fine dining... Go downtown Scottsdale. If your looking for a good time go to the sand bar! Live it, live it! Be free, just to b!"}
{"text":"Will never go back after being shoved and called a cunt by one of the bouncers. I was not drunk or giving him attitude at all!!!! I was talking to him about not letting one of my friends in for not \"being to drunk\" which he was not. he didn't want to hear anything i had to say he then shoved me to the point where i almost fell down and called me a cunt."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time saw Rachel the bartender deal with a big mishap like a champ!! Kudos definitely will come again because of her!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for Monday night football and I would come back any day! We were able to pick our own table outside without having to wait. The restaurant is mostly outdoors so plan to embrace that AZ weather. The drinks were awesome, I would consider them fairly generous on the alcohol front. We had the burritos and it was amazing. And last but not least we had an outstanding waitress Miranda. She was kind, beautiful, and knowledgeable. It's cleAr taking care of her clients is her first priority and it's rare to come by such awesome customer service these days. Needless to say... I would come back and recommend this to any one!"}
{"text":"This place is made for sunny days and drinking. That stated:  Cheese enchiladas w/ancho sauce: VERY salty. I usually like salty food more than the normal person but this dish was super salty. Not sure if it was the sauce or what. The plate didn't blow me away and I didn't expect it to, however it truly was barely edible.  Draft Beer Selection: Not great either. For a \"Mexican Grill\" (using the term loosely) I guess I expected a few more choices.  Again I think on a sunny day this place could be a fun spot to have a drink. It is set up with sand and cabana style seating as well as more traditional seating.   Staff were nice. Waitress did forget my water but whatever, I mumble sometimes...   In all not the worst place I have had to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered raspberry vodka with cranberry. I requested it to be remade because it tasted horrible. Second time, just as horrible. So basically expensive, horrible drinks are what I got tonight. No thanks."}
{"text":"Redemption for Sandbar Chandler.  After a less than pleasant experience our first time at Sandbar, GM Bill Hovey and staff truly put the customer first.  Bill saw my complaint and immediately left two voicemails, an emall and eventually invited me and my wife for lunch today via facebook.  We were greeted by the very pleasant Jen as we walked in. Our waiter was very pleasant and funny without being too over the top.  We started off with chips and a great trio of salsa and cheese dip. My wife had a very tasty burrito and my ahi and shrimp tacos had a great combo of spicy and sweet. (FYI Tuesday is $2 tacos).  We finished off with fried ice cream with fresh pineapples. A tasty end to the meal and the beginning of my food coma.  In a time when you hear more excuses than accountability, Sandbar Chandler was a refreshing change.  They are back on my radar. Thanks Bill."}
{"text":"Awesome food...always great service, maybe a little pricey. My last munchie there was the breakfast burrito and it was to die for. Fun place to go especially if you are a Packers fan!"}
{"text":"First Yelp review because best service on my worst night.   I just want to start this review off by saying I was probably having the worst day of my life. The kind of day where you wander around aimlessly and don't want to really interact with anyone you know, or anyone in general (and I'm a pretty social person).  The second thing you should know is this is the first Yelp review I have ever written (I've always meant to, I use yelp to decide if a place is good or not). I eat out a lot. almost exclusively. It's not that I'm too lazy to cook, I just have better things to do -  I'll leave the cooking to the pros. So anyway, this review is important to me.  I was out riding to go to a place to eat when I saw that the sand bar was busy. I'd been here once before for a work thing on taco Tuesday and remembered that their tacos were good.  I walked around looking for a good place to sit, I wanted a table to myself so I could do some paperwork and not think about things, but I ended up at the corner of the bar. The guy behind the bar saw me very quickly, something that is actually quite unusual anymore. He got me a drink and introduced himself so fast that I was impressed.  Later on some really drunk guys were trying to talk to me constantly, which is fine (I'm a guy) but one guy started getting inappropriate and touchy feely. The bartender(s) promptly got him a cab and took care of me, seeing that I really didn't want to be bothered.   Another thing is that I really enjoy Moscow Mules and they were made really well, all 3 of them, by the bartender. She was great.  Anyway, too many words. First Yelp review because best service on my worst night. That about sums it up. I'm going to copy and paste that and put it in the beginning actually.  Also the food was good."}
{"text":"Love the sandbar!! Ordering their complimentary chips and salsa is a MUST. The green salsa is so good, I crave it all the time. They have an awesome Taco Tuesday -- $2 for each taco (and the tacos are delicious) and $2 Dos Equis lager and Amber.  This is my favorite place to go for lunch on Tuesdays. It's also a bar on the weekends, but that's not really my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Honestly, had a blast! We met great people. Made connections. Our server Lauren was amazing and so much fun! It is slightly expensive for the type of environment, but the place is in chandler, so I expected it. The salad I ordered came  super quick. There is a smoking section and a non smoking section. An out door bar and rentable cabanas. I will def come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Sandbar is a cool place for HH.  I have been here a few times and its always good times..I love the huge patio, people watching. they offer bar food that is OK except for the mini chimis and nachos are pretty tasty. Service is not always the best but I expect that from such a busy place. Overall it's a casual bar thats perfect for HH with friends. I'm sure I will be back. Fyi...noticed many cabs waiting to offer rides to anyone who is not able to drive. It would be cool if sandbar created a taxi line like they have in vegas, this would allow folks to party without the risk of d&d."}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the food.  Ate here for lunch in March.  Service was good but may be due to only two tables being used in the whole place.  My wife got a breakfast burrito and I got the carne asada tacos.  both were good.  Can't complain about the food.    The outdoor patio was nice, with a big cabana bar and tables set in sandy areas.  Overall this place seems more of a place to go at night to get your drink on.  From reading the previous reviews I can only imagine what the clientele looks like.  Based in the following I think I know.  As my wife and I were walking out to our car, some young guy was dropping off a girl at her car in the parking lot.  While I was laughing the guy in the car made eye contact with me and started to laugh too.  I just hope he was nice enough to get the poor girl breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was good, service (Michelle) was awesome.  The concierge thing in the bathrooms was somewhat weird.  However, the resaon I will not go back is because they allow smoking.  I hate the smell of smoke and expecially despise it while trying to eat.  We were there for lunch, but I get the feeling it turns into a meat market at night...just saying.  And the music can be loud, even at lunchtime.  Please get rid of the smoke!"}
{"text":"April 15 2018 went to Sandbar nice atmosphere. Received very poor service. The waitress service SUCKED. The glass my drink was in was DIRTY.  If any owners or management read this, I suggest that more training on ensuring clean dishes are being served to all customers."}
{"text":"First time at this joint with a large group of friends of mine for their \"taco Tuesday\" so I was very excited. Although I did leave pretty disappointed in the service. Service was provided by a server named Krissie. Not only did our server not warn us that the kitchen would be closing so we didn't have a chance to order more tacos (I literally left hungry) but she also forgot every single persons order and then forced us to close our tabs because she was cut. Being a former server myself this is beyond ignorant and disrespectful behavior. Despite the tacos being good I will not be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"My favorite afterwork happy hour spot! Chambord margaritas are the strongest limit yourself to 3. Get the wings with the sauce on the side awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week. Our experience was horrible. Drinks were not mixed right. They were out of some ingredients, and the food was just bland. The waitress forgot things and was not very polite. I had high expectations, but was definitely let down. We will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food poisoning on 3/22/15. I am 4 months pregnant and those 48 hour were the most awful hours I have ever experienced! I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"Good place for cheap beer and Tacos on Tuesday. Too bad the place is overwhelmed by cigarette smoke.  You're going along having fun when suddenly you feel like an ashtray is shoved up your nose."}
{"text":"I noticed months ago that construction crews were working on the structure formerly known as Bahama Breeze. Note: I didn't shed a tear when Bahama Breeze shut down, like, a year ago. I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants (other than Jenny's), and the Breeze to me was nothing more than a glorified Applebee's with a pseudo-tropical theme. Whatev.   So what was this new establishment going to be? A Walgreens? CVS? Fresh&Easy? A strip club? (Dear lord, PLEASE let it be a strip club. I'm begging you. It's a good 40-minute drive back home to Ahwatukee from most of the other fine establishments, and I've found that the longer the commute, the harder it is to get that stripper smell out of my car.)  Much to my chagrin, the joint reopened last week - not as a gentlemen's club - but as the second coming of Bahama Breeze: Sandbar. That was my impression as I pulled into the parking lot ... that I had waited all this time and the place reopened as a smaller version of itself.  But in fact, Sandbar is different. Than Applebee's, I mean. Turns out it's like a cross between Salty Senorita and Dos Gringos. (Sandbar also has locations in Peoria and Scottsdale, neither of which I've been to nor did I know exist.)  The digs are pretty cool, actually. Mexican beach theme with several overhead doors that bring the outside in. In fact, the outside bar area is surrounded by sand. Actual sand. Hence the name. Sandbar. Even though I got sand in my Pumas, I decided it was a pretty cool touch. Ladies ... you might not want to wear high heels, however. Continuing with the theme, they have cabanas and a little beach/wading pool thing that I guarantee drunk people will end up in on many nights, even though it's supposed to be just for looks.  I had the Famous Sandbar Chimichanga, (made famous, apparently, by the other two locations, as this one has only been open for eight days), and it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to me that often times, restaurants that put so much effort into their theme have food that's just \"eh.\" The chimi is all I had, so I've nothing else to report culinarily; just know that it was tasty.  Thirty-some-odd flatscreens scattered about the place. Looks like it could be a good place to watch the game on Sundays.  The service was just okay. I'll give Sandbar a mulligan on that, seeing as how it's their first week in operation and I imagine they're just trying to get their feet under them. But it better rock next time.   It's been said - and it's entirely true - that the place doesn't make the place, the people make the place. So ultimately, that will decide whether or not I frequent Sandbar. Too soon to get a feel for the vibe here. There was a whole range of folks patronizing the place on this evening, probably trying to figure out for themselves what kinda' scene it's gonna be. From seemingly normal cool people, to the \"Did we get lost? I thought we were on Mill Ave\" crowd, to the \"Does my Affliction shirt fit tight enough?\" crowd, to the \"They say 60 is the new 25, right?\" crowd ... they were all here on this evening.  Eww. But again, a mulligan because the place is new. We'll see ...  Still have sand in my Pumas. Three stars for now."}
{"text":"Bad service rude waitress and eh food. Only come for the drinks and atmosphere because it's a popular spot especially for Friday night... But I don't think I'll be back. Had a waitress bang on the bathroom door multiple times while I was helping my friend in the bigger stall. We waited in line for our turn just like everyone else. When we came out the random female employee took it upon herself to let me know she was \" F***** waiting and I was taking to F***** long. when I told her I waited in the same F***** line she didn't reply and we walked away... I thought that was weird but didn't think twice about it until 5 minutes later. I had 3 security guards stand around me telling me I needed to leave because I threatened the server.. Wait what?  I work in the industry and this is the only place that I know of that allows the staff to treat customers so badly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on 10/29.  The food is always mediocre here, but the service by our waitress Katie during this visit was the worst.  Despite being asked twice if we wanted chips and salsa and responding yes, we didn't receive them until just before our meals came out.  We had to wait unreasonably long to get an  extra cup of ranch dressing and a second drink. While we waited for our waitress, she blithly chatted with all the single males at the bar (not her station).  The fastest part of the service was when she delivered the bill....she was then back to the table several times then.  I would not go here if you want descent food or any kind of good wait staff service."}
{"text":"Our bartender Jackie took care of our group the other day at the pool bar.  This girl knows how to treat customers.  Bubbly personality and was very helpful with drink selections and food choices.  Not sure where they got her from, but wherever it was lost an awesome employee.  Will definitely be going back for a great time."}
{"text":"It's a love-hate relationship with this place, especially for those who understand how non-existent the late night scene is in northern Phoenix. Our choices are limited so I'm usually stuck with here or Salty's in Glendale, which is just a blast from my high school past that I'd like to ignore. Believe me, the choice makes me want to gauge my eyes out too.  It was packed because of the UFC game when I went and you could hardly get around the sausage fest with everyone awkwardly standing and roaring, let alone try to wave down a bartender to get you a drink. When you did though, I will say that the girls are extremely nice, attentive, and quick. Does it overcome the horror when I see how much it costs for just a couple of drinks? Unfortunately not. Definitely a place where you'll have to get a little skeezy if you want something other than H20. Friends were telling me that it gets better when the music turns because everyone actually starts moving around, but the UFC fight had just barely started and I was dreading standing around in heels in the cold with the outdoor heaters not doing any favors for me.   As if on cue though, someone from above felt the pain in my calves and SIlva's career died in front of my very eyes. The UFC crowd left and music began. Crowd consists mostly of MILFS and ordinary looking guys who come alone dancing by themselves hoping for something, if anything. Definitely an extremely milder version of Mill with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Good dance music though, played a lot of 2000's hip hop.   Can't judge on food as I didn't get any, but I'd say that it's worth the extra money and time to go somewhere else or end up awkwardly standing next to a Mexican statue trying to get a drink for the next 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here today for an extended amount of time started off with happy hour and it moved into dinner.  first I'd like to start with the pros: The margaritas are strong and the food is decent.  they do you have a happy hour which offers food at six dollars an entrée. The place is spacious so regardless of what time you arrive you usually are  able to find a seat. The problem I had is that I was nickeled and dimed for everything without them even mentioning that there was a charge. For example if you want to add a flavor in your margarita it's a whole dollar extra it is not stated anywhere on the menu nor did the server care to tell me. We also got fajitas and were served three tiny tortillas with it and when I asked for just a couple more tortillas we were brought them but not told that we were going to be charged for them we only ate one of the second amount of tortillas they brought us yet we were charged $1.50 extra. If you want to charge for every little thing and every added thing that is fine but either your menu needs to state it or the server needs to tell you I spent almost $10 additional and little extra fees at this place tonight. Oh I almost forgot I got the guacamole to start it was pretty much flavorless and despite me letting my server know that I didn't care for it not only was I not offered a replacement I was still charged for it. I will be pretty hard-pressed to return to this location"}
{"text":"The food is okay , but the staff is horribly rude. I've been here twice and both times my server has acted as if they don't have the time to wait on the people in my party. By the time they would come back to check on us for more drinks, I was already sober again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and left a not coming back impression. I had ordered the Mexican Cobb Salad no cheese. This salad consisted of : lettuce greens , bacon, avocado , grilled chicken , roasted corn, jicama and tomatoes. After waiting for about 20 minutes we finally received the salad,  oh and really with cheese. So I sent it back and they made me another great it came about 10min later and all that was on it this time was some chicken roasted corn lettuce tomato.  The food server asked if it was good this time.  I politely let them know that it was missing a few things like, avocado, jicama and bacons his time so back it went. It's just a simple salad. So it came back again , all almost there. It was missing this time chicken , and roasted corn but, they put all these big carrot slices that was not supposed to be on this salad. They brought the chicken no corn. So finally  Came the corn not roasted but cold out of a can. What a lasting impression. a manager came over apologized and offered a Dessert. The whole thing was not a good experience and doesn't even deserve the one star but the waitress kept apologizing about the whole ordeal. It was a first, last , NEVER again."}
{"text":"I went to this Sandbar location (my first time ever at a Sandbar even though I lived close to the one in Chandler) not too long ago with a few friends. It was interesting and had a cute beachy vibe with actual sand on the ground. Maybe I would have thought it was more cute if I wasn't in boots. :( Darn you fall fashion staples in Arizona.  Anyways, there's an indoor and outdoor bar. And this place was packed on a Saturday night. Like packed to the point where I was trying to go to the restroom and some fratty douche backed it up into me. Have no fear, he got pushed into his clan of douches.  So this place would be cool maybe if I was super drunk before I got there. But I wasn't. And I didn't get super drunk (I think?). Typical club-ish scene. I guess I'm just a grandma in a 21 year olds body and was expecting more of a laid back bar since my parents went to the Chandler location before, LOL. Darn."}
{"text":"DANGGGGGGGGGGGG this place generally has terrible reviews. Why?  I came here as a meeting spot to get on a party bus, and was actually surprised at how warm I was being that its generally an outdoor venue.  My complaint: the bartenders werent very friendly. And we're very anti talking. Most bars I go to, when there's NO ONE at the bar, I appreciate not being rushed to order, here... They just want to talk amongst themselves as employees, very unprofessional if you ask me. The people that come here are pretty laid back, and a diverse crowd as well.  I'd come back, but the drink deals aren't as impressive as other bars and their appetizers are mediocre. At least I can say I've tried it! Probably won't be back though, not unless I'm meeting friends who care for this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and enjoyed it each time.  Food is very good with rather creative twists for \"Mexican\" quisine.  The service is quick and typically with a little humor unless they are super busy.  Staff seem to enjoy working there.  Worth a meal just to try and different place or check out the many happy hours during the week."}
{"text":"This place has turned to worse. Bad service, waiters are either rude or don't come to the table for a long time. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour before the Coyotes game. I liked the laid back feel  the service was good. We shared chicken nachos and it was a good size portion. Between that and chips and salsa we were full. Good specials in beers. The margarita was so so.  It seemed like later in the evening it would be a happening place. There was a band setting up outside in the area where it was set up like a beach and more people were coming in the later it got. We loved that you could buy buckets of beer. This would be a fun place to be with a large group of people."}
{"text":"This bar has so much potential, but fails to capitalize! I ordered a margarita which was probably the worst tasting margarita I've ever tasted. I then had to wait for close to 20 minutes as bartenders walked by and ignored me before I finally was able to exchange my drink for a beer- which by the way I was charged the full price of the margarita ($8) because the bartenders were too lazy to fix my order. Oh and I didn't even get an apology and the bartender seemed burdened that I was asking for a replacement. The crowed was a odd bunch off people and I could tell that most of them were not from Desert Ridge but probably from the west side. A lot of older douchey guys who think their still 19. It's a total Affliction bar. People reading this will know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"This place does have a great set up, and they know how to pack in a crowd. But I still think they need to work on service!!! Jon Taffer would not approve. Waitresses should be checking back constantly on tables. They just don't seem to grasp that concept here. If you're willing to suffer bad service and high prices for a loud packed place, come here."}
{"text":"I'm so inebriated, just so you know...  Like this place, ok music, and crazy but not like packed or bad crowd crazy just crazy...Like there is sand, all on the patio, and this tiny ass pool...oh they like water down the drinks so before you go, get tossed because you'll spend a fortune trying to get drunk here,, i was fortunate enough to run into guys to pay for my shots of Patron...and yea...oh crap, I need to lay down, I just know, I'm good now, it took awhile but, this place is alright, nice crowd no drama, ok music and just good times all around, you cant be mad at that, right?!! I smelled tacos, too bad I was too drunk to be hungry, otherwise I would have tried them out..."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to hang out. The wife and I went here after dinner and shut the place down. We don't get out much so this is not really our cup-o-tea, but that is not the establishment's fault. Nice bouncers and a lot of security, I could see how this place could get rowdy. There was this hella old guy creepin all on the girls and doing a dosi-do dance, so what was extremely fun to watch. Good bar service with nice bartenders, smoking section all outside and good music. We had a good time.   There was this dude making tacos and he was handling money with this same gloves he was cooking and touching everyone's food with. Kinda gross, but if I was that drunk I wouldn't care. So be weary about that..."}
{"text":"Sat outside in the bar area. The music is deafening. Went at about 2pm, so not even happy hour. The Ahi tacos are pretty much tasteless. Needs cilantro or something. The waiter never asked me if I would like chips. Just in a rush to serve, and a wait to pay. And yet another  restaurant that assists you with the tip calculation, based on total, including tax.  Not horrible, not good."}
{"text":"Before coming to the Sandbar, I had read up on some of the other Yelp reviews and thought, \"Okay, I'm going to give this place a chance!\"  So I went with my family, my mom, dad, sister and brother. We were seated pretty quickly and had our drink orders taken. Which was probably the only good thing that really happened during our visit.  We ordered a plate of wings to start us off before we ordered the rest of our meal. Our wings came in pretty fast, but we didn't have any plates or napkins on our table, and our waitress was no where to be seen. So we just started eating and had TWO wet-nap packets to clean our hands. Ugh.  We ordered a ton of food, a chicken burrito, a combo ceviche, Shrimp tacos, nachos, fried calamari and mussels.  My mom didn't like the burrito too much, and said for the price, she could've gotten 2 better tasting burritos at Humberto's. I really liked the Calamari plate, but the breading around the Calamari was soggy. It made me sad because it really did taste good!  The nachos were good, the mussels were okay... A bit too salty even for my tastes. My sister wolfed down her tacos with no complaints and my dad was pretty meh to all the plates we ordered but ate all of them anyway.   My margarita was sub-par, for 8 dollars I could make a better one at home, but I'm lazy so I ordered one anyway to maybe challenge all the nay sayers here on Yelp... But that was a futile battle. Our Waitress disappeared for long intervals of time and it wasn't as busy as it would be during a weekend.   If you have money and like to drink, this is the place for you, don't come here expecting 5-star service for a restaurant experience, a bar is still a bar, even if they have food.  Probably never gonna come back here unless someone is treating."}
{"text":"Expectations were low based on the overall so-so review average, but I came away impressed. Had a large happy hour gathering from the office, and tried many appetizers, all of which were fresh and tasty. We had one waitress servicing a massive group and she absolutely nailed it, always there when you needed her, super-pleasant, and just on her game. Drinks were good too. Will give it a shot again for dinner."}
{"text":"Started off ok with a good seasoned waitress, took our drink order. Then another waitress comes and says I'm taking over doesn't introduce herself. Gets our drink order again, brings water/lemon for girl and I get Modelo Negro and I had asked for Modelo Especial. So we get that straight and it's a warm beer in a washed glass. Took one drink, I complained to our waitress and she brings something a tiny bit colder, In between there we ordered food,  drank half and it was warm quickly. Got our food dropped off by a young gentleman. So we sit there while our waitress walks by(doesn't check if we have napkins & utensils) over and over again I'm trying to flag her down. I can see the place is busy, so I ask for a manager. Manager shows up quickly introduces himself asks what can I help you with I explain my warm beer to start, the second isn't any better but I'm trying to drink it, manager says I'll pay for those and gives me his apologies which where sincere! I also tell him that our waitress didn't bring napkins or forks nothing, stating to him isn't she supposed to get us ready for a meal? He (manager)said yes I'm sorry. I said if she's busy she should ask for help or go to you. He (manager) said yes she should have but I'll get the napkins & utensils. So we start eating our cool food at this point. My taco trio weren't the greatest. My girl had hotwings & fries. I ordered a Dr Pepper because of the warm beer. Ok I was going to give them a 1 STAR because of Veronica the waitress. But I went to 2 STARTS because of the management hospitality. He took off the 2 warm beers and comped the 2 Dr Peppers. But I'll say I won't be coming back dues to my service. I always say \" it can be a crappy location but great food, drinks and service and I'll be back in a heartbeat \""}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and was super excited to try this place but it turned out to be so disappointing. The food was not good to say it nicely , I got the fish tacos and not sure how you mess that up but I only ate the fish out of it as I couldn't bear to eat the rest. Beans were average, rice was bland. Service was awful and it was slow when we were there. Nothing exciting about this place, dont waste your time unless your only coming to the bar for a drink."}
{"text":"One of the girls at work was leaving so we decided to have a drinks after work session for her bon voyage.  I've been dying to come here for a long time and honestly I don't know if I can give this an accurate review.  It was 3:00 in the afternoon on a Monday and we were literally the only people inside the place and a few people were trickling in out on the patio.  Happy Hour starts at 3:00 p.m.   Our waitress came over and took our drink and food orders.  Came back with drinks and shortly there after food came out.  Next thing you know, she's coming over and asking if we want our checks or are we going to hang out for a little bit longer?  We all kind of looked at each other and told her we were going to hang out a little longer and we all wanted a round of water.  So off she goes to get our round of water.  We all sat there wondering, does she not want to make more money?  Why would she think we only wanted one drink.  Happy Hour went until 6 or 7 but I guess it was so busy that she needed the table to be turned over.  Will I come back, probably not.  Maybe that's why our waitress works the day shift.  She may not be able to handle the larger crowds."}
{"text":"Sandbar is an easy choice.  When you want to grab a drink or 4, and enjoy time with friends or family, this is an easy meet up spot.  It lives up to the name and has sand outside on the patio.  It brings that type of party you remember from your college days, and the loud environment is always there.  This place does a good job with happy hour and the many drinks and many different tacos.  I've never taken a chance on their $12, $13 burgers partly because they seem over priced to me."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have some drinks watch sporting events it's your typical barfood but, beautiful waitresses at times it can be a little crowded especially if there is a huge boxing or MMA fight basketball etc. I love the place it's not far away from home and the prices along with happy hour makes it work for me. I do strongly recommend and I do suggest trying out the wings!!!"}
{"text":"The feel of this place is so very beachy and I love it! Outside some of the tables are actually in the sand and it's pretty fun for everyone! The service is ok and taco Tuesday has become one of the only reasons I come here any more. I don't think I can say much about their drinks because I always seem to be on a little bit of a mission and want to get in and out so I just get water and tacos. Their fish has always been super fresh and the taco combinations are interesting!"}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere can be a bit much and it can be difficult to get a table, the food here is super good, notably the mini chimis, Jalapeño burger, nachos, and most of the tacos. Great place to go around lunch when the weather is nice and you want a beer and good food, although I'd personally avoid it weekend nights. It's not the fact that it turns more into a club then, but rather that there's a cover for what equals to a casual experience."}
{"text":"Came here with some of my buddies for food and drinks after work last Friday and let me tell you, it was AMAZING! Food was great and service was amazing.  Definitely the spot to be at if you just want to grab some food and a few drinks after a long work shift. Good overall vibes!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was a great deal. $2 Dos Equis draft, $2 per (big) taco... I'd recommend the regular fish taco over the mahi mahi. Carnitas was a bit dry, but the flavored were all good."}
{"text":"I had the nachos asada at Barrett Jackson and they were great. Instead of a small over priced portion you got a great size serving covered in a awesome queso."}
{"text":"I lived in Scottsdale for 7 years and just came back for a visit on business and hit Sandbar for the first time in a while. It is a place to dig your toes in the sand and sink back with some cheap happy hour drinks and chips and salsa. No matter which location, just go to meet your friends, enjoy the desert sun and have no high expectations on culinary greatness."}
{"text":"Love this place. My second time coming here while visiting Arizona. Excellent music, drinks are cheap, and good crowd. Def my go to spot in Arizona"}
{"text":"Great crowd, diversity and I'm not talking about the boat.  Ordered a Corona with grenadine n the whores flocked. I'm starting to like Phoenix .   On so apparently don't be black in here tho. I got kicked out for literally nothing, it's crazy. They claimed I spilled someone's drink, I even offered to buy the person another drunk but they weren't going for it. Go figure right. Fuck this bar ."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night for drinks. Fun place to check out. People said its like being at a beach, definitely didnt get that feeling. However, drinks were good. Bartender didnt make a three wise men correctly. DJ played really good music. Probly wont come here for tacos though."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and food was okay.  I went here for a night out and it was packed. The music was not that great and neither was the crowd.  The bouncers gave us a hard time with our IDs because we were out of state. I would not recommend this place for a night out.  I would however recommend this place for an afternoon football game and some beers."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to grab some cheap food and drinks on Ladies' Night.  I had no clue what to expect, but Sandbar definitely exceeded my lack of expectations.  From the half-price pink margaritas (were they actually pink?  I'm still not sure.  Man, they didn't skimp on the ETOH content) to the cheap appetizers (many of which were $4!), there are great deals to be had.  I tried to be healthy(er) and ordered off the normal menu instead of the Ladies' Night specials and was super pleased with my Shrimp Tacos.  We also liked that there is literally sand on the ground outside (so you track sand into your car, just like the real beach!) and that we could watch my husband's fantasy team players suck it up on the big screen.  I think I've found a new favorite sports bar!"}
{"text":"I love the nachos and Sand Bar. I also love the service. Amazing!!! I like to hang out on the patio and drink margarita. :)"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had for Cinco De Mayo. We walked in and it was open seating and we had a party of 5 so we decided to get a booth as we wanted to eat and get drinks. Our server was new as he indicated 40 mins later after none of us had waters. I realize it's Cinco De Mayo but not even getting waters or acknowledgment for 40 mins is unacceptable. We flagged several employees and they said they would go to our server and let him know. We ended up taking to several people and would get items served every 30 mins. They messed up some drink orders and served the food with no utensils. Our food was cold by the time we got silverware which we had to bug a bus boy. Completely unacceptable and I'm going to disputed the charge with my bank that's how bad this experience was."}
{"text":"I am not (and have never been) a fan of Sandbar.  The level of douchery at this place always amazes me.  But a friend of a friend had a birthday there last weekend during the playoff games, so I went up there.  Although the douchery was still front and center, I was surprised that the food was actually pretty good.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and they weren't half bad.  My friend also ordered them, but got them with the jicama tortillas instead (which is just thinly sliced pieces of jicama).  For those avoiding carbs, it's nice that they offer an alternative to regular tortillas.  As for drinks, my first was the prickly pear margarita -- it was just *bleh* -- not nearly as good as Teakwoods.  But the spicy mango margarita, which I ordered next (and next) was all that and then some!  Love it!  I wish I could get that without having to go to Sandbar, lol.  Anywho, I was pleasantly surprised on this visit.  If not the douchery, they might get an extra star."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service is horrible every time. They last time I went was for my birthday a month ago and I went there with some friends after dinner with my family.  I ordered wine and the bartender acted as if I ordered some foreign drink that she had never heard of. She was like \"ugh I guess I can check and see if we have some\". I know that wine may not be a typically ordered drink there but that's what I had been drinking previously before at dinner and didn't want to mix alcohol and go to vodka or whiskey. She was just super rude and made me feel like it was absolutely ridiculous that I ordered a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great drinks. Good prices. Always has the games on and has bags outside."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Biggest problem (I know this is petty) bathroom attendant! I wanted to stay but I had to pee and didn't want to have the attendant offering me a paper towel to dry my hands and expecting a tip. That's why I left."}
{"text":"In all fairness Sandbar is a fun place to go, but keep track of your credit card if you use one there. The bartender forgot to give my card back to me, so I called the next day to see if they had it. I was told that they did, but when I went to pick it up, they couldn't find it. Frustrating!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the only positives I have... Great chips and salsa, glad they finally expanded the beer selection to add some decent craft brews, and the patio is nice as long as it isn't wall to wall and that crappy DJ doesn't have his less than desirable music to loud.  The rest, I could take or leave. The food is very average, bordering on poor, compared to other Mexican places. Based on that point, very over priced for the quality. When they first got the craft brews, the good Happy Hour prices applied, now they don't. What gives? Every other place in town will honor Happy Hour prices for all drinks, including crafts.  Weekend evenings are way to crowded, for my taste.   Overall, a mediocre place to hang out, unless you get their early and choose to drink something that the Happy Hour will actually apply."}
{"text":"The worst service and reception I have ever got anywhere. The margarita was terrible, watered down stuffed with ice. Ordered appetizer and entree and it all came out at the same time after our waitress Darian forgot our drink order. Don't go here, there is a in and out burger next door."}
{"text":"Craft beers are entirely excluded on the regular Happy Hour.  Young girl working bar didn't understand why we declined to drink something else and left.  What a joke to have a somewhat diverse taplist and then completely omit an entire segment of the customer base on regular, daily happy hours.  Our group will drink elsewhere at Desert Ridge for happy hour.  So many choices."}
{"text":"The douchy wanna-be Scottsdale type waiter took forever to get to our table. He's all grins to the cute girls at our table and won't acknowledge any guy. I could see one of the managers sitting at the bar drinking. Probably off her shift, but she's there in her spare time?  Seen other of their staff hanging out drinking too.  Maybe it's just me, but it feels awkward to be around that.  It also probably explains why their service sucks, because their employees treat the place as their personal hang out instead of their place of work.  Also, the music was loud and spazzy. I appreciate a good mash-up too, but this stuff was just painful and obnoxious.   My guess is that the only reason this place gets business is because it's the only game in town for the Chandler/Ahwatukee area. I don't know too many people that actually enjoy going here, but it's probably the lesser of two evils (instead of driving to Scottsdale). PLEASE let there be more competition for a good bar/nightclub in this area!"}
{"text":"The sandbar in Chandler is a sad overpriced experience that will leave you wondering why you went there. Their food is absolutely horrible (I attempted to feed my leftovers to my dog and she wouldn't eat it... Okay she did eat it but when she threw it back up she refused to eat that), so is the service and on the weekend they charge a cover charge for God knows what reason? Horrible environment with annoying meathead clientele."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of flat screens around the bar and throughout the restaurant, with a huge projection screen in another raised enclave.  There is an outdoor bar with surrounding tables but I didn't notice any tv screens outside.  The seats @ the indoor bar suck, so I lobbied for a booth.  (The bar seats were like retro, high chairs that lacked a back you could lean into a lil too high, even for my legs).  Happy hour included a few 1/2 priced appetizers that the waitress highlighted.  She also provided a thorough explanation of speechless communication that would ensure our miller lites continued.  If you face the empty bottle @ the end of the table with the label facing outward, she'd pick up the empties for replacement.  I only forgot about this rule once & received a fresh bottle while I still had a 1/4 bottle left.  No clue how much the beers were but the deal seemed pretty good, since we had @ least 10 beers & an appetizer for $30.  The folks there seemed to run a tidy & expedient little operation and overall my experience was a'ight."}
{"text":"a good place to hangout with friends. they offer various kinds of shots and other alcoholic drinks. they have mexican food in their menu...love their adobo pork tacos; outside, they also have a bar with a beachy ambiance."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews about this bar because the managers here are the greatest !....... But once again, I have brought a group of friends and the service is beyond horrible..... 5 guys, 25 min and still haven't taken out order. Do I look like I can't afford it? Did we not dress nice enough? Do you not work for tips? Every time I come here the service is absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere = great! Outdoor space = excellent! Food = mediocre at best.   Love the outdoor patio space; very lively, nice bar, lots of tv's even a live band playing. Kind of a care free, fun atmosphere. Great to go have a drink and relax. Food, however, was mediocre at best. Had the soft taco combo and chose 3 unique tacos that sounded delicious.  None of them were delicious; all kind of bland. Wouldn't go back for food but might go back for a drink or two on the patio after I ate somewhere else"}
{"text":"Went there for an after work drink, sat at the bar and it wasn't too busy. One bartender, either you didn't see her or she was talking to the couple or guy at the end. Two guys came in then she told them a minute and was talking to the guy at the end and they still hadn't got a drink when I left. The barback was there and I had to get him to get her once. He was helpful and pleasant. Either get one bartender that can handle it or have two."}
{"text":"We only went there once for a couple drinks for Happy Hour. Just in town to visit family. Probably won't  be back anytime soon, but this is my impression.  The outside area cute w beach theme *duh Tables mixture of trad & surfboard shape & stools heavy made of metal aka HEAVY!   The outside bar has multi-level of tvs..though some hidden under bar roof hindering viewing, but still lots of tvs. We were there opening of March Madness.   Our waitress was great. They use expeditors...another waitress was not, I mean a Bitch to her expeditor. Of course these waitresses are probably 21-23, cute skinny, the poor expeditor was same age, super nice to his tables but not the \"perfect\" 10 & overweight. I was so annoyed & sad & wanted to complain but it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I hope the mgmt does some training with these girls, people see things that they might not think gets seen & doesn't leave a good impression."}
{"text":"Younger crowd.  Good outdoor seating setup with outdoor bar and open air to indoor bar.  I was here for apps and drinks, and a second time just for a drink.  Reasonably priced for what you get.  Typical appetizers and beach themed drinks.  I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this place and I definitely was not.  Due to the location in relation to where I live, I will be back for lunch drinks."}
{"text":"So here is the deal,   I get that this is supposed to be like being at Manny's in Rocky Point, the ocean on one side, drunken slutty girls on the dance floor, and more booze than you know what to do with. But the thing is if I were at Manny's, I'd be wearing a bikini, some denim shorts and flip flops. Totally comfy and cool for a night of humidity, wind, sand, tequila, lots of sweating and bad decisions.   Ok now I'm wishing I was five years younger and I could actually BE at Manny's right now.   I digress, this environment just isn't conducive to a normal prissy girl's get up. I know I'm not the only one fighting the granules of sand in my heels, because that seems like it is the only thing my girlfriends and I talk about all night. \"Ouch, I can't get this damn sand out\" \"Well take your shoes off\" Shoes taken off, shaken, and placed back on. \"Damn it! More sand!\" ...yea. It's a vicious cycle.   So, really cute guy with the GORGEOUS blue eyes, I really was interested in what you were saying...I just had little tiny pebbles cutting into my skin the entire time you were talking to me. Maybe next time you'll still think I'm cute in flip flops? Here is to hoping...  +1 star for the street taco stand. Saves whomever is my DD a stop at Jack in the Box on the way home."}
{"text":"Unfortunately some drunk guy touched me innapropiately Saturday night causing my boyfriend to end up in a fight. Security was amazing. They ran up on my boyfriend and immediately identified themselves as security and didn't use excessive force. They walked him over to the officers and let them know that he was not recisting. (The officers were great too BTW) I also want to appreciate the fact that there are cameras in there. Had it not been for that my boyfriend wouldve ended up in jail. So thank you.  Besides that though this is our favorite hangout spot . The music is always good and it's a great atmosphere.   P.S If there was a black diamond earring found please contact me. It was lost during the commotion. :D"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on Friday night and place was busy. 5 of us enjoyed the food and service. Looked like a fun place to spend time with friends. We will be back. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Service is OK, but the food, not so much.  Outdoor seating area isn't comfortable and I can't see a good reason for going back.  I have been there twice and I just do not see the appeal.  Typical sports bar with a decent amount of TVs"}
{"text":"An interesting night landed us at Sandbar, even against better judgment.  My friend was kind enough to pay the $5 cover fee, which made it no less annoying.  Cover fees at bars without live music?  That's usually a deterrent for me.  I am just not the cover fee paying kind of gal.  We walked into a packed house of people my friend described as \"at least double our age and wearing half the clothes.\"  Obviously, that's an exaggeration (but not by much).  The place was so smoky (yuck) and the ratio of men to women was probably 3:1. though the ratio of men to ladies was 3:1/4.  We stayed for exactly one drink, wherein my friend declared this was not her type of place.  I couldn't help saying \"I told ya so,\" but she needed to see it for herself.  After last night, I am sure she won't be going back.    The best part of this place?  Getting to talk about the clientele afterward.    I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"Stopped in Thursday night for \"Happy Hour\". Very disappointed to say the least. The outdated appetizers didn't sound or look good. The beer choice was below average for happy hour options. Wound up ordering off the menu and had tacos. $14.00 for 3 small soft tacos. While I don't eat at Taco Bell, these would have never made the Taco Bell menu.  I will say our server, Rachel was awesome. Friendly attitude and obviously happy with her job.  Sad to say We will never return to the place."}
