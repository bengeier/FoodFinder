{"text":"This was by far the best place to hang out and chill. Couldn't say anything bad, the tea and the coffees are by far some of the best I've had in a while. AMAZING juice, and at a great price. So I would say go and check it out if you vape, and if you don't go get a coffee or tea."}
{"text":"BASELINE and GREENFIELD location SUCKS!!! I guess i didn't have enough tattoos or drop the F-bomb every 60 seconds to fit in and get any customer service. FULL OF TWEEKERS JUST HANGING OUT.... REALLY LAME. i might have bought a bottle of over priced \"premium\" juice but the first six testers i tried didn't work. Six in a row! I was in the store less than 10 minutes and its 10 min of my life i wish i had back. Unless you are very patient and spend your free time coaching high school drop outs in the art of good salesmanship, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"}
{"text":"Amazing! Charles was literally the best person to even help us with vape juices. Got a whole new set up. Spent a good hour in the shop with Charles. Trying so many juices, he was so helpful. Decided to try this vape shop out of the blue and so glad we did!! Thanks Charles!! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today to checkout this location. Great setup and nice ambiance. I wasn't really looking to buy anything but ended up picking up a Subtank mini and the sales guy was very knowledgable and explained the differences between the Aspire Atlantis and the Subtank. This will probably be my go to store now since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"I've known the owners of this Vape company for a few years now and they have never failed me. You can't beat the prices for juices, atmosphere or coffee! I recommend this company to all my vape friends! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome people.  New spot.  Looks great and they have a new coffee bar.  Plus they have everything in stock."}
{"text":"Came to this place looking for a new set up. The staff was awesome! Very friendly and informative. I couldn't be happier with the service! They had a great inventory and plenty of juices to choose from. Would highly recommend them and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to socialize and meet knew people. The staff is very friendly and their coffee is AMAZING! I love coming here for their coffee. I'm not much of a vaper but I can't pass up their coffee. The owner, Charles is an awesome, helpful guy. I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Went in last week with a buddy (because of the hype 98KUPD kicks out) after shop hopping for a few, there's definitely some great shops in the area but not really this one. We walked in and got a \"sup guys\" then the guy spent the next ten minutes on the phone with what seemed to be his significant other after which he gets off and just kind of stands there while we tried some of their burnt tester tanks. To say the least i was able to hold a conversation with him for a minute without going brain dead which is a plus, but besides that the place was super dirty and grimy, prices on outdated equipment were absurd, prices on current equipment were a travesty and the general mindset of screw it 98KUPD will keep sending us customers was pretty obvious. Overall i cant believe the worlds greatest rock/morning show that ive been listening to for half my life is supporting this horrid establishment, i wont be going back and hope nobody else does."}
{"text":"I'm not a joker, a smoker or a midnight toker. Well, ok maybe a joker. 1 out of 3's not bad right?    In regards to the vapor thing it's just not my bag baby so typically you wouldn't find me in one of these establishments. However, I was just coming out of rehab next-door and I saw these really beautiful, tall, full figured cups of what resembled a vanilla mocha iced coffee. On top of that, I caught a glimpse of a donkey Kong arcade game shimmering through glass window. This really peaked my interest so I decided I would take a chance and cruise into this vapor lounge. The nice thing about vapor is it typically smells pretty fruity and my allergies aren't going to bizurk. So I pulled up to the bar and had a seat, chatted with the barista for a little while to ensure I was making the proper selection. I've got to say, probably one of the best ice coffees I've had a very long time. It was so delectable that I decided to sit there for a while and just relax. I know right, who has a spare second in their day to relax. Well, it made me feel like it was back in the day before I had all this responsibility and a cell phone attached to my ear 24/7. Since I'll be visiting the rehab next-door twice a week for the next couple weeks it looks like I'll be giving this Vape lounge a couple of my hard-earned dollars in exchange for some delicious coffee and sanity."}
{"text":"Mitch is awesome, he set me up with a new vape and juice when I had no idea where to start. This is all new to me, but he was really helpful and informative. I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The staff is both friendly and extremely knowledgeable.  I've been to a ton of different stores, testing juices, and I have to say that their house juices are, by far, the most superior. The flavors are incredible and the creativity of the mixtures are amazing.  I can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Maybe Charles was cool with other customers but was a total jerk with me.  That was my first and last time at this place."}
{"text":"I had no idea they had coffee and teas. I don't vape but I love good coffee and tea! Mitch was so nice and answered all my questions. Today I got a white chocolate and lavender iced latte. I can't wait to go back and try their teas and Kombucha! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Always have had good experiences here. Bought a tank was having problems but they were more than happy to fix it. They are always pleasant and more than happy to help. Plus it seems like their e-juices are some of the best"}
{"text":"Visited this vape shop today and was pleasantly suprised with the service and prices. Charles showed me whole inventory and helped me pick what i wanted. I also had great coffee on the spot during my visit. Thanks!"}
