{"text":"My son and I went to Ricks Saturday February 28th. It was around 7:00 and it was busy. The man at the door who I believe was the owner said it would be 15 to 20 minutes. Right after I came in a beautiful blond came in with her infant child and husband. They were clearly on the list after us.   So 15 to 20 minutes comes and goes and I notice that the blond is seated before us. The owner, very nice guy, told me we would be seated soon, and proceeded to seat other people in front of us. If it were not for my son who was very hungry, I would have walked out. But I kept my mouth shut and we were finally seated.   The waitress was probably the best part of the experience. My son ordered a 14oz rib eye that was very thin and seemed to be loaded with tenderizer. I BBQ rib eye steaks close to once a week and it is our favorite cut, and this was substandard. The menu said choice of potato and my son ordered the sweet potato fries and we got an up charge. He also ordered onions and mushrooms which were not on the steak and which we had removed from the check.   I got 1/2 BBQ chicken which I liked a lot.   I told this story to people at work and they suggested I post on Yelp. I gave it a week to allow myself to think about it because this place is the owners livelihood, and I take the reviews seriously. But after going to a number of other restaurants, and being treated respectfully, I think the review is necessary to let the owner know that in this age of the Internet you cannot get away with treating people that way.   So if you are a regular at Ricks, and are seated a head of other people, enjoy the privilege. If you are not and want a good meal and be treated respectfully, you may want to check out some of the other fine establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner I on the patio. The good and service was great! A very good deal. The wife and I had dinner and drinks for under $50 which is something to be said in chagrin falls."}
{"text":"Ribs are the best!  Service is slow...but love the casual atmosphere!   Great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Rude phone service. Waited for a long time for a table with 2 other groups before someone said that waiting by the \"please wait to be seated\" sign was the wrong place. All 5 of us had fries, all were burnt. Didn't bring part of our order. Food was just ok. Waitress was noticeably slow. Menu was weak. At least the beer was good; they didn't mess it up."}
{"text":"I love the art deco decore of the restaurant.  The food is very good.  I love their home made rib/BBQ sauce.  Their burgers and baby back ribs are amazing!  It is always busy, but the service is still top notch.  They have pastas and other foods as well. I always go there for their ribs though.  The beer and wine selection is also a plus.  The owner is gracious and constantly checks on tables to make sure everyone is having a wonderful dinner.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Ricks Cafe.  Not impressed. Won't be back.  Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy. 6 customers. We sat ourselves at the bar. Bartender said she would be right with us. After sitting for quite some time we finally got our own menus. One of the other servers, a young man made our martini. Bartender finally showed up to discuss wines. One and done!! Didn't want to stay and try the food. Horrible, poor service!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went to Rick's one afternoon. The server, Megan came over & took our drink orders. Brought back our drinks & we still needed couple minutes to decide on what we wanted to eat. Literally 10-15 minutes went by and she finally came back and apologized because she \"got caught up in the cavs game\". My husband inquired about the two different portion sizes on the salads. Megan said that the small salad was big and that the large salad was huge, enough for two people to share. My husband was like oh, I'll get the small with blacked salmon. We also ordered buffalo scallops as an appetizer. For my meal I ordered a combo rib platter. She brings out my coleslaw. Shortly after the scallops come up out. They were pretty tasty. As she comes to clear the plate, she carries it over my husbands head & there was no reason to. She had a clear path as we were actually facing her on the patio. She spilled buffalo sauce all down my husbands body. It was in his hair, all over his shirt that we got in Maine, and all over his jeans. I couldn't believe it. She was barely apologetic & brought over some soda water & a towel that my husband requested. She did bring a couple shout wipes. We get our bill and Megan charged my husband for a full salad & when I asked about it she was curt & looked us in our faces & said that was what he ordered. I was beyond done at that point. She never told a manager so that they could come touch the table to see if we were okay or to apologize. She didn't pay for a beer to show \"goodwill\". Nothing. She is an incompetent server and a scammer and the food is mediocre at best. Watch out for dishonest Megan & be very clear about what you order. In fact, don't even bother. It's horrible."}
{"text":"Really a half star. Went early 5pm, place was half full at best. Waited 15'minutes for waitress to show up, we ordered then waited 45 minutes for our food. Watched two tables who came in after we ordered get and finish their food before ours came. Of the Five orders everything was cold and some items burnt. We did not eat anything, told management who had the waitress apologize and said no charge. We left but had no options to eat as everything was full up. Thank you Rick's cafe for ruining our day with our son and his family. Certainly won't be going back!   Should You?"}
{"text":"It seems Rick's Cafe has gotten complacent in serving mediocre food by inattentive waitstaff. Heard it was a nice, local place so gave them 3 tries over the last 6 months but there is nothing which would compel me to return.  Two stars for the outdoor seating, location and interesting decor."}
{"text":"The baby back ribs are awesome like usual! There are five \"fall\" handcrafted beers on the menu as well. Nothing like Chagrin Falls in autumn for a good setting too! When you go to Rick's, do yourself a favor, get your fingers a little greasy, ask for a bowl for your BONES and go to town. Don't be shy if you want more sauce just ask for it!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! We have been going here for close to 30 years. Nothing has changed, not even the food. Great bands on the weekends. I remember as a little kid listening to Friday night music with my Dad. The decor is classic art deco. Small cozy booths and seating.  Only thing I would change is to bring back the Choc. Choc. Chip Ice Cream they used to serve!!"}
{"text":"Excellent clam chowder & swiss bacon burger.   Chicken sandwich was delicious.  Puo puo plater..shrimp ribs wings coleslaw great as well. Service was very good."}
{"text":"We came up from Pensacola, Fl to visit my boyfriends family and we decided on Ricks Cafe. This is my first time in chagrin, and the place appears like it would be a great local food joint.  There were 7 of us, including a small infant and a seven year old. It took forever to get refills on water. They started out by giving us coleslaw that \"tasted like the smell of a petting zoo\" says the 7 y/o and the adults agreed. One of us ordered a fruit plate that contained 2 quarters of an apple, 2 small slices of melon, and 2 small slivers of canteloupe. The waitress told us that it was 3 DOLLARS!   40 mins later we finally got our food. I ordered the half turkey club with a half a cup of chili. Others got the lunch ribs with fries and chicken Caesar salad. The fries were cold-ish, the food was just ok.   Our waitress didn't come back after the food was served. She came by and grabbed empty plates after. Then we waited and watched her eat a couple tables over. We went up to the table to ask her for the bill and got out of there!  I gave this review two stars because i liked their windows."}
{"text":"Chagrin Falls is filled with an assortment of hit or miss restaurants, and this is definitely one of the good ones.   I don't eat meat anymore, but I remember the Buffalo burger being pretty good, and now I usually get the black bean burger when I go, which is great!   If you're in the area, I'd recommend going!"}
{"text":"rick's cafe is a mainstay in chagrin falls has been good for a long time great burgers outstanding ribs grilled wings are fantastic but today i needed a healthy lunch & they have great options for that as well  the grilled chicken with steamed vegetables & jasmine brown rice was perfect"}
{"text":"I go here often and recently notice a new shorter menu. That's good but some of the mainstays such as shrimp appetizer with noodles and the seafood pasta Del Mar just aren't up to par. They both taste bland as if they are missing ingredients. Getting harder to find something I like on the menu  Please clean up the ladies room."}
{"text":"Best Burger in Town! Cant wait until the patio opens! Always a blast on the weekends. great place to hang out or grab lunch and people watch."}
{"text":"Rick's location and beautiful patio brought us to the door; Wing Wednesday and $4 Margaritas made us mid-week dining fans.    Service excellent, sauces superb, wings meaty, mushroom & Swiss burger juicy, broccoli done to perfection.    We also like Rick's because it's not pretentious - a rarity in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"The guy I happened to follow in from the patio entrance -- the one who let the door slam in my face -- turned out to be our waiter. The service continued in the same indifferent fashion. The lettuce in my hamburger salad was droopy and room temperature, while the meat prepared \"medium\" was burnt and crunchy. The food came quick, despite having a large party, so points were earned there, but all of it was mediocre at best. Hold out for Jekyll's across the road, or lower your expectations."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered 2 diff burgers, medium cooked burger w cheese sauce, horseradish sauce and another medium cooked burger w cheddar, mushroom, pepper & onions. Both burgers were barely lukewarm when they arrived and the fries were the same. That wasn't even the worst part... They were also charred on the outside layer leaving them crunchy and overdone while the inside of the burger was a pleasant-looking color pink. The char flavor completely overwhelmed any other flavor of the burger itself or the condiments etc. it really just tasted like crunchy char and that's not a good thing. On a positive note, service was quick and Gretchen was very nice. Unfortunately those 2 things aren't enough to make us come back. Pretty disappointed since we really wanted to like this place w it's great location."}
{"text":"We came in and were seated immediately for lunch.It wasn't busy then. Had a nice lunch of sandwich, fries and good iced tea. Nice atmosphere for lunch. We were served promptly and the food was correct."}
{"text":"Yikes, my first time there was a comical disaster. Ordered a veggie burger and was served the wrong kind. The lettuce, onion AND bun top was missing... How does that happen..? The veggies were too buttery (I had asked for no cheese and I like to stay away from dairy, so this was an unpleasant surprise) and tasted like they had been microwaved and left out (some pieces were cold). The walnuts on the burger were supposed to be chopped up but instead they were whole (I didn't really care much, but it's the lack of consistency that is an issue). Just all around bad experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good as usual. The place was empty and they had buy one get one burgers. Can't complain about Ricks!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a resident of Chagrin Falls, and I've never, ever, ever, had good service here. Not even mediocre service. The food is nothing to write home about either when it finally comes.   The most recent visit here, which was only because of the need to use a $20 gift card, started out with a lovely seat at the bar where no fewer than two regulars were served well before the first contact with an employee. It went something like, \"Have they not served you yet?\"   My light appetizer took over an hour to show up, and my cash payment plus gift card took them over 20 minutes to cash out.   The manager (owner?) was completely unsympathetic and made an excuse (\"we are not used to using computers!\") as to why everything was so slow. His almost insulting response to my complaint inspired this review.  If you have all the time in the world, the beer tastes the same as anywhere else. But don't go for the food, and don't go for a chat with any friendly bartenders, because you won't find any of that here.  Two stars for the newly renovated patio. But you'd better bring your own beverage if you don't want to go thirsty."}
{"text":"I was a bit leery after reading these reviews, but we had a nice meal here.  On a very busy night we had very attentive service.  We ordered off the specials menu and out food was good, but not outstanding.  The gourmet fries with garlic, olive oil and parsley were outstanding!"}
{"text":"ricks was packed on a monday night.  we had to wait 20 min for a table but it was well worth it.  great local spot. super casual and everyone was so friendly.  try the pu pu bbq platter.  a combo of shrimp, wings and ribs.  i was pretty impressed.   great cole slaw and fries.  Ricks loses one star only be because our table was too cramped for four.    we will be back."}
{"text":"Really nice little cafe with gorgeous decor. More restaurants need to be art deco, seriously.  Their clam chowder is quite good, and whatever else I had was quite good. I don't remember precisely, but chances are it had cheddar and  apple smoked bacon on it, and was a sandwich of some sort.  A nice place to go if you want a different kind of charm and less bustle than Yours Truly (which is probably the best or second best Yours Truly service wise)"}
{"text":"Used to have great food and service.  Total decline for both.  Food is mediocre and sometimes just plain awful.  Staff can be unprofessional, rude and just don't care.  One female server was rude and almost seemed high on something.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick dinner on a Friday night.  It became apparent that the ribs were the most popular item on the menu just by being nosy and looking around at what fellow diners were eating.  The boyfriend got the baby back ribs and I opted for a grilled chicken sandwich with swiss and bacon.  I normally 86 the bread but I couldn't pass up the garlic bread it came on.  Yum.  Their BBQ sauce was good and service was good.  Older clientele."}
{"text":"Second time there this week.  Great outdoor patio.  Love it.  Hoppin' place!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome sports bar that has REALLY good food!  My family ate there on Saturday and they were extremely accommodating.  We wanted to watch the British Open and they put the TV in our area on the channel.  Everyone had something different but we were all very pleased!  Would totally recommend. P.S. My husband left his cc at the restaurant and they mailed it to us.  We offered to pay them to do this but they said \"no way.\"  If we are every in the area again, we will DEFINITELY go there!!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great. It smells, it's dirty, the staff is less then friendly and the food it so so. Hopefully something changes here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is OK, but this place has run its course. Burger was...well chewy? Bun nasty. Fries were stale and tasteless. Chicken for the Ceaser Salad tasted old and dry. All this at 5 on a Saturday evening. There are many better choices near by so help motivate this place to do better by spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Saturday April 28 ... had the BBQ brisket ... one of the worst meals I've ever had.   Meat was tough...old.... fatty.  Doused in BBQ sauce.  Could not believe how horrible it was.  Friend's pulled pork just as bad.  Cold mash potatoes.  Service was borderline poor.  Waiter pretty much ignored us."}
{"text":"As always, a consistently good meal. Their BBQ sauce is a major draw and I had a healthy option lunch but had them do my chicken in the sauce.   They accommodate and service is above average. We ate outside and the patio is tight which is a drawback. The other drawback is that the AC units are just plain loud.   The noise didn't necessarily ruin the experience, but you would think they would find a way to buffer. Other than that, it's a good place worth a visit if your in the falls."}
{"text":"Ricks is an icon in Chagrin Falls.  It has been here for a very long time.  It recently claimed an alley next to the restaurant which it turned into outdoor seating.  You wouldn't think sitting in an alley would be a pleasurable dining experience, but they have made it really nice.  The alley patio is always packed up.  The beers are cold and the bbq is great.  We love the ribs and the cole slaw that goes with them is probably the best in town.  Their pulled pork isn't bad and the burgers are really delicious.    You'll find a friendly wait staff and management.  Makes the whole experience nice.  If you are in town on a lazy afternoon, make sure that you stop at Ricks Cafe and enjoy a cocktail on the alley patio.  Great for people watching too."}
{"text":"Gone downhill.  Barbecue ribs and chicken dry and old.  Burgers good.  Overpriced."}
{"text":"I almost never eat beef, but the hamburger cooked medium rare yesterday rocked. I've known this place my whole life, always pretty much the same. Compelling vintage trimmed tables, booths, furniture, bar, mirrors and the rest, acquired the old-fashioned way -- having it for a really, really long time.  The renovation a few years ago is really nice and classy... except the warped, junky, old, cheap-tiled dropped ceiling is still their. Make it go away."}
{"text":"I should have gotten a burger but was afraid it would be undercooked so I got the bbq brisket.  It was flooded with bbq sauce on a plate with mash & a veggie medley which was really good.   The mash wasn't like gramas old fashioned.  It was legit potatoes that were mashed.   No milk or butter added for creaminess.  The brisket was fatty and not really good at all.  I had to scrape the sauce off. Others in my family had the chili, mussels, baby back ribs and fries which were all really good. The fries were especially good.  Not my first choice."}
{"text":"So, I am not one to really complain too often about anything,  I tend to be sympathetic to the fact that a lot of things can go wrong in a restaurant.  Today was just a blatant disregard for customer service and quality food.    I work in Chagrin Falls and have the wonderful fortune of working directly behind two amazing restaurants  - Hunan By The Falls and The Burntwood Tavern.  We always try to frequent locally owned and operated places for lunch.  We tried Rick's Cafe a few weeks back were thoroughly unimpressed with not only the service, but also the food.  I like to give a place a second chance in these matters and decided to head to Rick's today for lunch with a colleague .  We were seated almost immediately and asked for our drink order.  We both ordered Burgers - I asked for fries and my colleague ordered a salad.  That is my first point of contention - they offer no side salad - only their \"Dinner Salad\" for $5.  The \"Dinner Salad\" is nothing more than greens and onions.  I get it, we are in Chagrin Falls - but really?  With all of the amazing locally produced produce out there (which I'm not sure they even use) - is it necessary to charge that much for a side salad?  I digress.  So we place our orders and we wait.........and wait........and wait.  Our server disappears to God knows where.  The other server on the floor was a bundle of energy - running food and filling drinks.  I eventually had my drink refilled by who seemed to be the MOD.  40 minutes later we are delivered our food.  40 minutes during a not so busy lunch service.  The burgers were luke warm at best and the fries seemed fresh.  That was, until I sank a little deeper.  Seems that the food had sat at the window waiting to be picked up - and when they saw that it had been sitting for awhile - threw a couple of fresh friend on top of the stale ones that were on the plate.  When we brought it to our servers attention - she apologized but did nothing to offer up any assistance.  We also put in a to go order that was ended up being cold and overcooked.  I will never go to Rick's Cafe again.  I gave them two chances and both of them underwhelmed.  If I want a burger in the area - I will take myself up the road to the Washington Street Diner."}
{"text":"Can any one tell me how to give minus stars?service terrible food terrible cleanliness washroom terrible .ranking this as terrible"}
{"text":"My folks and I had a lovely lunch here in between hiking trails. We had our dog with us and sat outside next to four other tables each with a dog! It was so nice to find a place that welcomes four-legged family members as well! Our waitress was friendly and patient. It was fairly busy when we were there so it took quite a while to get our food, but it was really good so once it did arrive we were satisfied."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to recieve our food, while we watched 3 other tables around us receive theirs even though they were seated later. When the food did come 3 dishes were stone cold and 2 were burnt. Kitchen here is so unpredictable and not worth the chance. Please go to another establishment in the are and save yourself time and frustrations."}
{"text":"Service was extraordinarily slow and inattentive. I should see the waitress more than twice: other than taking the order and bringing the check she should probably check on the diners. As far as the food goes it was a disappointment as well: seafood was severely overcooked, the bbq sauce was pure vinegar, fries were cold when they were brought outqq. All around, unfortunately, a poor experience for a relatively high price. Will not be back and I suggest you also seek out other options in the area."}
{"text":"It was an \"interesting\" experience from the start to say the least....   The service was a complete mess. Friends we ran into at the bar told us they ordered their food 30 mins prior and it still had not come out. We sat down and ordered our food. The server didnt know if they were serving lunch or dinner when we asked for a recommendation on an appetizer.    There was a piece of plastic in my sister's cheeseburger. We had to remind the servers four times to bring our drinks. The appetizer came out with some of our order... I say some because they forgot to cook my order. At the end there was not even an apology or discount on our check for all of the errors.    The men's bathroom urinal was overflowing and no one took action for the 10 minutes I was there after we told them about it. The women's bathroom had a toilet that didn't work (again no one did anything).   So... needless to say.... this was a one and done experience."}
{"text":"So glad it stays in Chagrin and keeps its image for good ribs and chicken. Was not pleased with the cole slaw recently.  Definitely an off night. The fries are generous and the place is crowded at peak hours."}
{"text":"Chuck E Cheese + Applebee's + A Tacky Suburban Sports Bar = Rick's  Name a bar where you can go to witness a children's birthday party (complete with cake and singing), poorly cooked food, and pudgy dads in Dockers screaming like buffoons?  If you guessed Rick's, you're sadly right.    It didn't used to be this way.  Rick's used to be a cool place where grown ups could hang out and eat and drink responsibly.  Now, with the rise of the irresponsible parent (kiddie birthday parties in BARS?) and perpetually emotionally stunted frat boys, this place has become classless and deafening.  Did the patrons cause the food to become sloppy or did the bad food encourage the bourgie riffraff?  Who knows.  Who cares.  Moving on."}
{"text":"Very disappointing first experience with the food, after hearing rave reviews from others.  Prices seemed high ($11.85 for a cheeseburger, $25.75 for a slab of baby back ribs) which is not excused by Chagrin Falls location -- this isn't NYC after all.  But more to the point, ribs were just adequate, nothing special, not particularly meaty or flavorful, sauce thin, \"not as good as Applebee's ribs\" according to my dining partner.  I ordered a regular burger cooked medium, which to me means slightly pink in the center, and this meat was barely cooked.  1/8\" was cooked on each side, the remainder was bright pink and soft.  Both came with large orders of fries which looked appealing but were somewhat soggy, not crisp as French fries ought to be.  Sorry, Rick's -- nothing terrible, but nothing that would inspire me to come back."}
{"text":"I had a delicious buffalo burger here today at lunch. It was really good. Cute place with Art Deco decorations, including some awesome chandeliers. The booths were old style, very narrow, which works well with my short mother. She had a hamburger chopped salad which was nice, but too big for her."}
{"text":"We frequent Ricks once a month for their two for one burgers, wing deals, or BBQ specials.  A tall draft takes precedence over my glass of water.  Stick to the standards on the menu and order fries well done or substitute those little round red skins.  Ignore any little kid that got dragged in by their parent, it's a tavern and not a franchise, put down your device and engage in conversation.  All and all pretty consistent.  Pretty reasonably priced.  A bit more Palio than vegan.  Locally owned and worth supporting."}
{"text":"Good service. Small location with not a lot of room for a party of 5 with 2 children. Prices seemed high for what you get but they had a nice platter for the special that looked good. I would probably not go back but it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Rick's usually has the best baby back ribs, but recently the ribs were fatty, cold and not prepared as requested.  Every restaurant can have an \"off night.\"  I'll give it another chance, some day.  I have been back three times since my negative review.  The ribs and chicken have been great and the service excellent.  It is a regular stop.  Congratulations for getting your act together, Rick's.  Another wonderful experience-this time on the patio.  Rick's has the best ribs in the city.  On Mondays it has a special rib-chicken combo for just $15.  The portions include cole slaw and a choice of potatoes and the portions are huge-usually enough for a take home meal."}
{"text":"I can't give it more than 1 star because I didn't stay! Sat down on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it wasn't that busy! After 15 minutes of being ignored my party of 3 decided to up and leave! Some of the staff watched us as we walked out and still didn't care to acknowledge us. Me and my guest don't mind waiting if the establishment is busy. But when some of the staff is standing behind the bar chatting and we're sitting there and don't even have water it front of us! Forgetaboutit...We're outtie!!! Too many nice local spots in Chagrin Falls to put up with this kind of ignorance! I do not recommend this place if you are hungry!   Walk down the street to Dave's Cosmic Subs, Flip Side, Yours Truely, Jekyll's Kitchen, or North Main Diner."}
{"text":"Noooooooooooo!  I grew up in Chagrin and Ricks was always a favorite.    Was just back again after a 20 year absence.    DISAPPOINTMENT.   Love how it still looks the same, etc.  But the menu is limited, and everything seems to be a pre-packaged, canned sauce.  \"Spicy\" is typical small town midwest: ketchup is rated \"medium-spicy\" - if you're expecting anything, don't.  Sadly, I have to say that it was a huge disappointment to be back there.    sigh."}
{"text":"Rick's is awesome.  A great local pub, with outstanding food.  Somewhere I read that everybody should be a regular at two local pubs, and if you live in Chagrin Falls, Rick's should be one of them.  The chicken and ribs special on Monday nights is simply the best value out there, and their BBQ sauce is outstanding.  For lunch, or even a light dinner, the chili is simply the best I have ever eaten.  The staff is friendly and seem to love working there.  You may have a short wait because the place is full on weekend evenings, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great Baby Back Ribs! I enjoyed them with the coleslaw and sweet potato fries! Definitely the ultimate rib spot!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience of my life. It took 2 hours total to receive house salads, and flavorless burgers. One of these burgers came out with a MOLDY bun. Our server was incompetent and unapologetic, as were her fellow servers. There was no upside to this unforgettably bad experience and I am usually a very forgiving diner. Save yourself. Do not eat at Rick's."}
{"text":"We have gone from eating here weekly, to monthly, to now never again. Horrible service and food.   We waited over an hour for basic salads and a blt. The kids ribs were burnt.    When we tried to share our experience with the manager, she was defensive and unapologetic.  We miss you at the front door Alec."}
{"text":"Food is overrated.service is lame. Bathrooms are dirty. Resteraunt needs a makeover..I go once a month.  Was there 9/21/13 to hear one of my favorite bands. Service was slow & not very good. Never cleared all the dirty glassware off the table. Had to search for her several times. Waited 10 minutes to get cream for my coffee. Dirty kitchen!!!if it wasn't for the band, I would never go there. Prices are way too high & menu selections are terrible Needs a makeover!!!"}
{"text":"Rick's usually has the best baby back ribs, but recently the ribs were fatty, cold and not prepared as requested.  Every restaurant can have an \"off night.\"  I'll give it another chance, some day.  I have been back twice since my negative review.  The ribs and chicken have been great and the service excellent.  It is a regular stop.  Congratulations for getting your act together, Rick's."}
{"text":"I always get some sort of BBQ'd item. The ribs & wings are better than any soul food joint in Cleveland. Awesome char and the sauce is good too. They ribs & wings rarely  need any additional sauce. Service can be lackluster at times but it's a good spot overall. People who complain about the prices....you're in chagrin falls."}
{"text":"LOVED the chili.  The burger was terrific, and my buddy and I both thought the fries were really good (I like them crispy, they were crispy).  My only complaint is about the service.  When we first arrived there was a patron who was standing next to the bar (not sitting at his table) trying to flag his waitress down so he could pay and leave.  I took a mental note of that.    I will say that as soon as we sat down a bus boy came and asked us for our drinks and refilled them frequently, but overall the service was slow.  The waitress was very nice, however,  At the time I thought it was just a busy day but after reading the reviews here I realize maybe that's just the way it is.  Go there if you've got some time and like good pub food.  If you are in a hurry you'd best try somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you want a fun, local diner feel, this is your place. The food will make you full and the atmosphere takes you back in time.   Like every great diner like restaurants, the fries and the burgers have the perfect amount of grease that make you so happy with every bite. Their ribs are tender and their chilli warms the soul.   Not only is the food and atmosphere delicious, it is priced perfectly, they have a great selection of draft beer, and on the weekends they offer live music as well!   If you are in the chagrin falls area, this is a great stop! My grandma use to take her daughters there when they were young, and now I take my grandma there for lunch when she visits and she is 92!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a 10/10. I was in town and my friend from Cleveland took me here. I ordered the half and half BBQ chicken and ribs. They were so flavorful I didn't even need to use the homemade BBQ sauce. But I did try it and it was the bomb. The chicken and ribs are insanely good. I got the house salad with the creamy dill dressing to start. That's the move. My mouth is salivating just thinking about it.  Great service, great atmosphere, well priced, amazing food. I will see you again for sure."}
{"text":"I had the ribs tonight: full slab baby back ribs with fries and slaw.  Slaw came out first and I chowed like it was an appetizer.  My daughters both had them as well and my five year old had sauce all over her face and the owner said she could be in an ad for his ribs! My wife and her friend had salads that were too big for them to finish.  They were out of thousand island dressing but the waitress was resourceful and made some herself."}
{"text":"The location of the restaurant is great it pulls you in. However the food is horrible. No seasoning in the wings or the chicken and shrimp dish we had. There is nothing that I can say good about the dish I had. The service was good."}
{"text":"Been to Ricks several times since moving to the area. Neither myself nor my family have ever been really exuberant about our meals there. The atmosphere is nice, and they are certainly a landmark, and the prices are quite reasonable.  The problem that gets them two stars is the \"meh\" ness of the food. Burgers are served al la carte (sell me a cheeseburger with fries for $12, not an $8 burger and $4 fries! Fries are cheap! They appear cheap to the customer, build them in and charge for substitutes!) and they lack...character, they even lack garnish. I had a burger with a slice of pineapple and some tropical relish on it (don't judge!)  and that is exactly how it came. No pile of veggies on the side, no sprig of parsley...just a bun with a meat patty on half and a slice of pineapple on the other, and a glob of brownish relish on a 9 inch plate.  My wife got a chef salad of some kind. It was a salad, that was her review...and my kid got the cheeseburger that came with, you guessed it, fries for five bucks. My burger cost twice as much and hers had the appearance of twice as much food for the money because she got a handful of fries that could not have cost more than a dime to produce. I ate the rest of hers, but shouldn't have had to. Ricks is our last-resort food stop in chagrin falls. We only went there this time because so many places were not yet open for lunch. Recommendation: poke your head inside and check out the Art Deco, then head on down the street to somewhere (anywhere, really) else."}
{"text":"We arrived around six on a Saturday, were greeted at the door and led to a booth, as requested. Service was timely and cheerful. There were gluten free and vegan options. The French fries are made from fresh cut potatoes. Mom says the burger was very good. I liked the local friendly relaxed vibe. If the food were organic, grass fed yadda yadda I'd give 'em five stars. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Decent food and beers in a nice setting, but unapologetically slow service mars the experience.  We arrived on a sunny Saturday around 1:00 for lunch. We wanted to sit outside, but went inside to check in with a hostess. We stood at the door for 5 minutes until we were told someone would be right with us. Ten minutes later, we were finally seated. We waited 10 more minutes to have our drink order taken. By the time we received our food and check, we had been there almost 2 hours.  I know Rick's has been a fixture on Main Street for ages. It's hard to see why with that kind of service. The staff was friendly - I guess they were just disorganized or understaffed - but other Yelp reviews seem to indicate this is a pattern rather than an exception."}
{"text":"I don't learn.  I just don't.  Otherwise I would have driven somewhere, anywhere, else for lunch other than cute little Chagrin Falls.    I've talked with my therapist and she says I'm punishing myself  for past misdeeds.  My monk says it's making up for bad karma I incurred in past lives.  My mom's priest said it was penance.  Rick's Cafe is the bees knees when it comes to decor-- cool Art Deco, that, while it has seen better days, is still rather romantic.    It has all the hallmarks of a Chagrin Falls restaurant-- pretty atmosphere, slower than slow service and mediocre to bleh food.  The barbecue is simply meat dunked in sauce.  No smokiness to speak of.  The buffalo burger was dry for a buffalo burger, and burnt.  And who does iceberg  chopped salads anymore?"}
{"text":"I was in chagrin falls on a late Saturday afternoon with my husband and mother. Decided to have dinner here in the new space with doors open to the sidewalk, as it was a beautiful day.   The host was acting like we were an inconvenience, but showed us to a table and threw the Menus on it. That table was covered with a half of inch of dust and we cleaned it ourselves. Then a waitress runs up and blurts out \"what do you want to drink?\"  Really! No HI, no nothing. Brought water out, spilled on the table and my husband had to catch the water before his pants did. Nobody cared about that or the numerous napkins on the floor, which all wait staff and management was walking by or over. The floor was absolutely filthy and dinner was just starting.  The wine glass was equally unappetizing looking, spots all over it, plates were smudged with grease. Now about the food: my mom ordered a Focaccia pizza with olives and stuff. I've never in my life seen a whole jar of WHOLE olives dumped on a pizza!  The cheese was barely melted and looked sweaty and white. The bison burger was not seasoned at all and the fries - some hot ones on top of a pile of completely cold French fries. Here's the good part - ribs were delicious! So between the poor attitude and mediocre food (unless it's ribs) they really need to clean up their act."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area from out of town and decided to come see the falls. Made the mistake of reading positive reviews of Rick's! I'll cut to the chase - I didn't want a sandwich, or a $6 and up salad, so I ordered two \"mini-plates\".  One was a rib-eye skewer. The other, eggplant with some fancy-sounding salsa. I pictured a nice tasty collection of rib-eye medallions interspersed with sweet peppers and onions. What I got  was one thin, fatty, piece of ribeye, pierced with 2 skewers, with 5 or 6 small pieces of red pepper. The kicker was the eggplant - about five slices of bitter, rubbery squash, with a very bitter reddish brown salsa to 'enhance' the bitter experience. My wife had a barely adequate buffalo burger, which we suspected was ground beef. The service was minimal, and the waiter did not even ask what we thought of the food. I have noticed the places that try to be upscale and gourmet, but aren't, never ask how your meal was. We figured it was partly my fault for trying to eat my meal instead of sending it right back. Of course I was very hungry and figured with the service being slow and uncaring, would have had to wait too long. Please beware of this place."}
{"text":"have tried this 2x, very good bbq and safe gluten free dining!!"}
{"text":"The place to be for good food and a Saturday night band. Crowded. Lots of people of all ages."}
{"text":"No where near Greece, but I had the best Greek salad I've ever had! My BF went against his moms warning and ordered the ribs. Good thing he doesn't always listen to mommy, because the ribs were excellent! He was willing to part with a few for me to sample."}
