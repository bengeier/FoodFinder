{"text":"Awesome little spot and great service.  Even though I'm not a regular, they started up a tab for me when I was short on cash. Really cute decor, nice atmosphere.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice coffee, euro style, good atmosphere.  I usually order an americano at this joint, they ask if you'd like milk and sugar and add it for you (hence the euro style coffee)."}
{"text":"Cozy, albeit small and cramped (the terasse is an alternative for seats when the weather permits), but the deco is lovely and so are the espressos. It is situated on a nice street and the banana chocolate bread is quite good. It is worth a visit when in the area, and there's also a great little shop with organic products nearby."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with friends for coffee and a pastry. The coffee is very good, and the ambiance is real Montreal. Friendly owners and locals hanging out and enjoying life. A definite must stop for a coffee in St. Henri, much better coffee than the big box store down the street."}
{"text":"Come by this coffee shop at least once a month and it's a 1 hour walk from my place. Amazing staff, always smiley and welcoming, good selection of teas and excellent music always. If you like butter, the croissant is pretty much butter in the shape of a bun, so decadent and delicious! I don't usually drink coffee, but I have friends who love their cappuccinos or a cup of hot chocolate. Cozy, warm, very Montrealy! ;)"}
{"text":"Lovely neighborhood, cozy atmosphere. Crowded with people! But i found the coffee is a bit bitter for me. Anyways, it's a nice and warm place for everybody"}
{"text":"While exploring the neighborhood, I made a quick stop in.  I really enjoyed the environment, as well as my coffee - an espresso beverage. The coffee was full of flavour and rich, the way I like it. The time of day didn't lend itself to sweets or savoury items, so I can't give it a full 5.  However, compared to other cafes on the N.D. strip, and others in Montreal, it's def. a cut above the rest - I'd rank the quality on par with Pikolo. ."}
{"text":"My favourite latte/capp. in Montreal, and in my top 2 cafes (along with Pikolo).  The few times I was here, the espresso had a deeper, richer taste than in a lot of other shops i.e. more Italian, which is what I prefer. Every time, my milk drink was well made.   If you haven't been here, you should check it out."}
{"text":"by far the best coffee I had in Montreal.  Nice atmosphere and the guys there are super nice.  Free wi-fi as well."}
{"text":"OK coffee if you're in the area but nothing special compared with the slew of great third wave coffee shops that have opened in mtl the past few years...there is one just up the street!   I do enjoy the cozy space and rustic decor, plus a nice little terrace out back, however I find the coffee just average. They're using a fairly dark roasted espresso which tends to produce smoky, slightly bitter bar drinks that can be a little overwhelming to drink black (maybe that's why they offer to add sugar and milk to everything?).   I have also found the barista to be very short with me each and every time I have been in. Pretty average questions about drinks-how many shots? what size? etc. have all been met with attitude. I'd like to give the guy the benefit of the doubt but it's happened on multiple occasions. No worries though, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love, love love  Lili and Oli.... what is great about Notre Dame street is you can walk down and get three amazing coffee experiences in less then 30 minutes.   Lili and Oli has great ambiance and is the quintessential neighborhood coffee shop around the corner. Great coffee and nice people.   If you like getting work done do not go on weekends between all the screaming children it can be hard to concentrate.   PS BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"Love this dog friendly cafe. Spent a nice afternoon there with my chihuahua. The service and coffee was good."}
{"text":"Location: On Notre-Dame, east of Atwater, just a a few minutes from Lionel-Groulx. It's the (almost) perfect place to pop into after spending a few hours at the Atwater market. See 'service' below to see why I say ALMOST!  The place: I love the look and vibe of this little café! It's got this old-school charm to it, with all the wood and antique decor. It's very small though, so you may or may not get a table. I had dibs on that comfy-looking couch but there was someone sat there when I arrived and I thought it might be a little obnoxious of me to kick'em out.   The coffee: I thoroughly enjoyed that latté - from a flavor perspective, it was pulled superbly. Yum! My only negative is that it was barely lukewarm. I would've liked it warmer - I mean, it IS coffee. My friend really liked her Chai latté as well.  The service: It sucked. No, I'm not kidding. The barrista was unfriendly and rude. Frankly, he was a bit of a douchebag with way too much attitude. If you don't like your job then don't work in the public sector - he clearly doesn't grasp the concept of customer service. This place would have scored an easy 4 were it not for this jerk.   Perks: Free Wifi, and if you get there early enough, they've got some pretty decent pastries/baked goods."}
{"text":"Location: East of Atwater, on Notre-Dame. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx (Orange) and it's less than a 10-minute walk from there. Street parking is available - both metered and not. There are certain streets that are not zoned where you can park without paying.  The place: It's not much bigger than their previous location but the layout is better. The decor is more urban and 'clean', if you will. Very simple, no bells and whistles. I do miss the other location's funky furniture as I think it added charm and a unique style, but what can you do? I do find the lighting to be a little dim. One of my favourite things about Lili & Oli is the music: 80s alternative. LOVE IT.   The goods: I've ordered an almond milk latte both times I've stopped in, and they were both enjoyable.   Service: Well, the barista is still a little surly and smiling is not his forte but again, what can you do. He makes some decent coffee and that's why I go there.  Price point: $4 for the latte - I don't think there is an extra charge for the almond milk but I'm not 100% sure."}
{"text":"As I am into cafe crawl montreal, I spot this coffee shop while I am walking on Notre Dame street. The name of this cafe caught my attention. I meet up my sister and tell her... let's try this place. I come back here. It's a very small space, but has a cozy feeling. The service is friendly, but it was long, since there is only one person working. My cappuccino was good, but I had better. Plus, it has free wifi... whooo whooo..."}
{"text":"Great environment and friendly people! Nice place to people watch. Coffee was a bit bitter for my liking"}
{"text":"C'est dur de ne pas donner 5 etoiles a un cafe qui accepte les chiens! :) Ca m'est arrivee tellement souvent de m'etre faite refuser dans des magasins ou meme des terrasses que ca a vraiment ete un grand soulagement de decouvrir Lili & Oli. Ils servent du tres bon cafe et des patisseries de chez Sophie Sucree si vous avez un petit creux. Il y a bien sur du Wifi pour les nombreux etudiants et travailleurs autonomes du quartier qui viennent ici. Malgre le fait qu'ils acceptent les chiens j'ai toujours trouve l'atmosphere tres tranquille- vu que c'est assez petit comme espace les chiens se promenent un peu pour dire allo aux clients et amasser des caresses mais ne courent pas comme s'ils etaient dans un parc. Ce n'est par contre pas un endroit ou vous pourrez passer toute la journee parce qu'ils ne servent pas de repas. Je recommande toutefois les terrasses de Gepetto Pizza et Burgundy Lion situees a un bloc du cafe- elles sont pet-friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe with decent coffee. Didn't try any of the food so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Ce petit café est une perle!  L'ambiance y est très chaleureuse, le propriétaire sympathique et surtout le café délicieux ! Le wifi marche très bien et l'endroit est suffisamment calme pour y faire ses devoirs ou travailler.  C'est sur, Lili & Oli va devenir mon spot !"}
{"text":"Endroit cozy pour prendre un café! Et une petite douceur! The viennoiseries here are delicious! Si vous aimez cafés et canidés, this is your happy place!"}
{"text":"This was the best coffee in Montréal.  Not to mention friendly, accommodating, and passionate.  The ice cubes in the cold brew were made of coffee!  Major kudos to the staff at this gem next to Atwater Market!!  Love from NYC!!!"}
{"text":"Si vous le demandez aux résidents du quartier, ils vous répondront tous la même chose, soit que le meilleur café des environs est servi chez Lili & Oli. Je n'ai pas eu besoin de me le faire redire trois fois avant d'y aller, et j'ai commandé un espresso double court. Je l'ai trouvé excellent, mais pas exceptionnel. Donc, si vous êtes dans le quartier, c'est un endroit à connaître, mais sinon, ce café est loin d'être le seul à Montréal à préparer de bons espressos. Aussi, on peut y manger des sandwichs le midi, auxquels je n'ai pas goûté, mais qui ont l'air très appétissants. Bref, c'est un café de quartier comme il devrait y en avoir davantage à Montréal."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré! J'y suis allée souper là avec un ami , et nous avons pris un plat (sepoca je crois ) avec homard et c'était succulent . L'ambiance était animé et joviale ! Service très rapide et friendly ! J'y retournerai for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a small coffee shop next to atwater market. They have a tasty coffee, and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you're in the hood and looking for a nice coffe shop, skip the big names nearby and pay Lili & Oli a visit! The rustic setting, friendly staff and beautiful little back patio will make any day a cozy day."}
{"text":"I love Lili and Oli, especially their iced coffee..... and of course their espresso, particularly their lattes and mocha.... you get the idea! Not only do they have a great warm feeling when you walk inside, they also have a small little area to sit out back, and makes you feel right at home.  If you haven't been, go and love it too."}
{"text":"Excelent coffee The mocha is delicious! I can't wait to try the latte and cappuccinos. I think the vienoiseries come from a place not far. They are very fluffy and tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favourite study spots.  Free wifi and a TV in the corner, always on TSN for short study breaks.  Casual relaxed atmosphere and great coffee and espresso. They offer soy or almond milk if you prefer. (Not all places offer in MTL almond milk).  The baristas are friendly, as are the prices.  They now offer sandwiches and salads along with the usual muffins, croissants and cakes. (And gluten free cookies from a local bakery).  The salads are prepared daily courtesy of Le Kitchen, a great vegan gluten free spot down the street."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here, for sure, when it's not too crowded. The decor is cozy, cream colours and lots of dark wood trim, high ceilings, nice bits of vintage signs, lights, chairs to sooth my soul, and the lighting is nice for reading but not overbright. And the baked goods, like the carrot cake with it's thick cream cheese icing on the inside, are sweetly satisfying and comfort foody.   A good Montreal cafe needs to deal with the fact that the city is often cold and dark and it's people need quality comforting and Lili & Oli does this well on most fronts. On a recent trip the service was a bit slow and surly, and the espresso shot was bitter and perhaps a bit burnt, or maybe that's just the beans they were using that day? And maybe they were stressing the crowds and line ups? It's a great cafe option in the area, but not always my favourite somehow."}
{"text":"Best cafe latte I've had. You can even request a heart shape design in your cup for ur partner. I found the staff to be super friendly.  Found it a little too crowded and compact for my liking but once I sat down and started having my coffee it didn't feel so bad.  It is cash only!!"}
{"text":"After leaving Westmount a few years back I moved to Point St. Charles, figuring the chances of getting a coffee in this neck of the woods being slim to none. One blustery Sunday in February I needed to go to the hardware store -- it wasn't open and I had to kill an hour.  Through a dark window I spied an espresso machine, and figured anything was better than being cold. I stepped in ordered a cappucino and have been back hundreds of times since.  Patrick and the boys do a great job, I think its the best coffee south of Cafe Italia. Great pastries and the lemon tart is to die for."}
{"text":"This place was recommended  by a new Montreal friend what a good score.  So nice to have a cappuccino that did not taste like the usual burnt favor.  The espresso was rich and the milk was not over processed.  The guys behind the counter were fast and very nice too.   The place is like someones living room you can just kick back and enjoy your drink or head back out to the street.  Will be going back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Friendly barista who knows his coffee. Beans are not fruity :)  Decor is cosy and inviting. Long wooden counter table is very cool."}
{"text":"L'une des bonnes adresses pour un café de qualité dans le sud-ouest!   Bien que je sois une grande fan du Café Saint-Henri pas très loin sur Notre-Dame, je viens parfois ici pour faire changement.  Très réussie la nouvelle adresse, bravo! Le barista était fantastique aujourd'hui! De bonne humeur et un super sens de l'humour!  Essayez-le!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Quiet atmosphere and good coffee.  The barista was very sweet and had great suggestions. I had their mint tea and an almond milk latte which were quite enjoyable. It seems like a very good place to get some work done, as everyone around us was working and were quite studious. They also have Fous de L'ile, which is not an easy find.  Definitely, a nice calm cafe to visit."}
{"text":"Was there on a quite afternoon, very quick  service. What's better than having a good cup of coffee with a man's best friend?"}
{"text":"The coffee here is great, and the atmosphere is the closest thing I've found to a Sydney cafe on my side of the MTL.  They don't server much more than (good) pastries and sandwiches to eat, but what more do you want with your (great) coffee? If you answered \"nothing\" then you are correct. If you answered something else, get out of my review already.  Are you around Marche Atwater? Looking for good coffee? Stop reading this review, and go there now. Seriously. This review will still be here, and it'll be better if you read it with a coffee.  For the nerds (like me): Has good wifi."}
{"text":"VIBE  Honestly, my dream cafe. And yes, one minus point for not being able to get an ideal seat. I ended up sitting on the couch and wiling the afternoon away. The clientele here is as friendly as the barista (that might be on a non-busy day). The best part? Dogs everywhere! It's like Korea! I love love love the decor details on the wall.   I DRANK The cappuccino is as good as the chai. But no cinnamon for the chai? Come on! I never get an actual coffee unless I trust the reputation of the place and these guys do it well. I didn't try their banana bread but next time. Same thing with their patio, which must rock in the summer.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Round of applause. Such a great vibe."}
{"text":"Was only there of a quick in and out, so I won't comment too much on the details. It did seem quite cozy (it's a bit of a tight space though), and I recall a few dog's at floor level - so that makes it dog friendly - I guess. I have to say the real reason I am writing this is because I am still craving more of their tasty banana bread - perhaps it's because of the chocolate chips (my Mom put them in too)."}
{"text":"Happened to walk by this place and decided to order a latte. Was a little unorganized trying to order as it is set up like a bar so there isn't really a place to stand in line. My latte was delicious though so it made up for the confusion. downside to this cafe is that they only take cash."}
{"text":"Nice Coffee Shop, le lieu est animé, le service excellent, le café glacer bon, endroit à recommender. Super quartier."}
{"text":"Si vous marchez sur la même côté de la rue que celui du café, vous pouvez facilement ne pas voir Lili & Oli et passer à côté à moins d'avoir vos narines ouvertes pour sentir le café frais.  En entrant dans le petit café chaleureux, vous y verrez un bar dans le fond avec une belle machine espresso. Derrière, il y a quelques autres breuvages et des pâtisseries si vous y arrivez assez tôt. Autour, plein de petites tables avec une majorité d'étudiants et professionnels bien à leur affaire avec leur laptop connectés au wi-fi gratuit de l'endroit.  J'ai su que ce café ferai parti de mon palmarès des meilleurs café en ville en apercevant la belle machine espresso qui donne l'impression de dire \"Ici, c'est moi l'boss\". Les barristas sont tous gentils et servent leurs cafés en portant une attention particulière à chaque tasse et en créant de beaux dessins avec le lait lorsque c'est possible. Je n'ai pas encore goûter aux pâtisseries et j'ai été satisfaite de mes cafés à chaque reprise."}
{"text":"4.5- My boyfriend and I were visiting from New Jersey and Lili and Oli was conveniently down the block from where we were staying for the weekend. It's perfect for an on the run cup of coffee as well as to sit down. We settled in, ordered cappuccinos and a croissant from the barista, and spoke to a few locals who were welcoming and helped us start our last day in Montréal on a good note. I'm very picky with my espresso drinks and their cappuccino has the right balance of roast intensity and frothy milk.  Unfortunately, they didn't convert our US dollar to CA dollar and they only take cash. Besides that, awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Great summer stop for velo-friendly java. Use the back door and informal patio. Americano was very tasty too. New location will need a new review...."}
{"text":"Nice Atmosphere, Staff super friendly, high speed wi-fi.. Cool for doing some work,, just awesome"}
{"text":"I miss this incredible coffee joint terribly! Best coffee in Montreal! Such a gem in such a vibrant city!"}
