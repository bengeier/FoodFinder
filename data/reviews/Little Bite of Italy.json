{"text":"We went there last night because my mother lives by there and wanted to try it.  Cute when we first walked in and sat down.   Pretty crowded..... bar was packed.    Our food was VERY sub- par and i had the WORST  spagetti  with meat sauce ive ever had!   Everyone at my table thought it was disgusting so it wasnt just me  the drinks are not cheap at all for being in a strip mall next to the Dollar Store... Seems like  they are ripping Sun City people off.  My friend had sausage and peppers in a very small bowl for $13 and he said it wasnt very good either  Salad looks like  it came of of one of those salad bags at a grocery store   The only reason I gave it one star is because the bar area looked fun.......  Everyone in my group said to give them zero Stars!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So, one night I was on a desperate hunt to find my favorite hot peanut mix at Walgreens, and decided to venture into Sun City. My girlfriend and I just so happen to pull into a local Walgreens at 99th Ave and Greenway. As we attempted to find a parking spot that was not occupied by a golf cart, she looks over and sees this little Italian restaurant tucked in this  strip mall, alongside a dollar store and clothing boutique that most likely closes at 4pm daily.   Anyways, for the next few weeks my girlfriend bugs me about venturing back into Sun City to visit this \"cute little restaurant.\" So what do we do? Head out on a Friday night date to Little Bite of Italy. You know, what all the 20-something year olds do on the weekend.  Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to see a large white tent on the patio area, occupied by live entertainment. Now, this 'live entertainment' consisted of a man in his late-50s singing karaoke and strumming on his guitar to the accompanying oldies music....but I must say, he had a very good voice-- the voice of an angel, if you will.  As we peered around the patio, the next youngest person was most likely 30 years our elder, but that was to be expected. I decided to order the baked ziti, and she, going with the safe bet of chicken alfredo.  As we waited for our food, an elderly couple got up and decided to get down and dirty on the dance floor. I do not know the names of many dances, so let's just call their dance the waltz. The couple waltzed it up for a while, putting on a rather impressive show for the patio. At one point, i made eye contact with the dancing man, resulting in him sending a huge smile and a little wink of the eye my --as if to say, \"check out the lady I've got on my arm.\"  Our food then arrived. My baked ziti appeared to have been baking for days, as the sauce was dried up and almost non-existent. Instead of complaining, I sucked it up and ate it--all while listening to the girlfriend state that her alfredo is delicious.  So, when it was time to pay the damages, I was a little more than shocked as to the amount I had to pay. Personally, I would've enjoyed a dollar menu burger from McDonald's a lot more....but the entertainment and people watching remains priceless, and unmatched."}
{"text":"Called in tonight for pizza. A little worried about some of the reviews but was very pleasantly surprised. This is an unpretentious neighbourhood pizza and home style Italian bar restaurant. Staff were extremely friendly and took our order as soon as we sat down and brought drinks immediately. There are a lot of older people in there (we are in our mid sixties and felt like teenagers) but what a happy friendly crowd. There was a young lady singing some of the oldies but goldies and a few people up dancing. We did wait 25 minutes for the food but it is all cooked fresh from scratch so it was worth it.  Would recommend this for good pizza and home cooking and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent value for lunch!  We had a Cobb salad and a soup/ salad combo. Good breadsticks. Nice patio. Friendly service. Would return."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place for authentic Italian food. All of the food was very disappointing, where we sent back a dish and ate only a few bites of the others. The pasta Mediterranean did not come with the vegetables it stated and had no seasoning or flavor. The lasagna was frozen and premade as the meat was the consistency of spam. The calzone was airy and filled with too much cheese that was not fully cooked. The service was unpleasant and not helpful. They were not friendly. The server could not speak English or pronounce our dishes. Oreganos is a 10 compared to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My mom ordered the lemon veal, and it was nasty, voted so by her friend that tasted it as well!!  The server would have nothing to do with replacing the meal, or compensating in any way whatsoever, the manager had the same attitude. Ultimately my mom left, on her birthday, hungry!    They claimed if they replaced food for everyone, they wouldn't have a business. Well, they won't have our business moving forward!"}
{"text":"The food is ok; a little pricey for the quality. The service is a bit on the slow side and I didn't feel very welcome being there without a partner.  It's about the only place in SC with music and a bar so it's popular but I only go occasionally and only because I live so close to that shopping center"}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive staff, but it didn't make up for bland food.  Had the sausage parmigiana.  LOTS AND LOTS of sauce, and btw, there was sausage there.  Sausage was very bland.  Strong in fennel, but not other flavors.  Sauce was very bland.  No flavors of any spice.  Tasted like straight tomato sauce straight from the can."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our tax guy (Delisle consulting) obviously we trust Bill but sadly the food is just sub-par.  We went on a Friday night,  it took nearly 10 min to be approached at our table. There was a one woman band singing karaoke,  she was decent but no one else was participating. Our waitress had a sense of humor but not the best. She cleared some of our plates just to set them on the table next to ours rather than bringing them to the kitchen (lazy)  We ordered a pizza,  a beef sandwich,  salad & wings. All of which were flavorless and boring. Nothing authentic.  I was thankful that we didn't order any Italian entrees, from what we saw coming out of the kitchen there was no WOW factor. We won't go back but I bet the seniors in sun city will continue to frequent the place as the food seems right up their Alley flavorwise."}
{"text":"First, what's with the other reviewers whining about the location?  The metropolitan area does go beyond their cozy little caves in the east valley!  Moving on...hey look it's a non-chain place to eat in the Phoenix area -- AMAZING!  The food was excellent, the service was great, it wasn't overly crowded (i.e. no long wait), and it wasn't one of those pretentious \"we're a cool Italian over priced fancy place.\"  It was the perfect place to get good food, relax and have a great time.  Something the west valley definitely has going over the east!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time  Excellent quality and service  Been going here for 10 years and always enjoy it Yes it is an older crowd place in Sun City,but you need to understand it for what it is and have a great time  Staff has changed a few times,but that is normal for most places So relax and enjoy"}
{"text":"Been at this restaurants numerous times to see Tom and Jerry perform. The food was very good but the wait once you are seated to order your drinks is not good. We had to ask several times for a a server. Also do not come back after food is served to check on your food or refill drinks   Servers need more training."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Staff, not friendly, not helpful. Owner, not available. Ambience, dirty. It is appear r that the owner is cutting corners when ordering takeout and they charge you for soup and salad and yet the same order eating in it's included. And instead of ordering new menus, they had staff use a black marker over the soup and salad portion of the takeout menus. When bringing out the food, not a word! This place relies on its karaoke and booze to stay alive. The food was not memorable . Will not go back. Proof that the Sun City crowd Ned's to demand better restaurants. Bye Cafeterias and little bite of Italy, a new generation is moving in."}
{"text":"My wife our friend Kathy R. and myself stopped here for lunch. As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by Lacey who was extremely friendly.  Lacey gave us ample time to Perouse  the menu until we all deicide what we wanted.   For starters I ordered the Calamari for my wife & I . It was alright, thinly coated but not really fired the way I normally like. It was decent but not special. I've had way better here in Arizona..  Our waitress brought us the beverages we ordered then took our meal order. Dinner gets off to a good start here with a nice basket of garlic bread sticks,Our entrees came shortly thereafter. Our friend started with the soup which she said was absolutely delicious.  For her entr√©e Kathy got the Ziti with a side salad. She raved about the garlic dressing. And kept going on and on about it until her meal came. She thought the Ziti was outstanding.  For dessert Kathy got the home made Tiramisu. It was soaked in brandy and espresso, layered with sweetened marscapone cheese and kahlua.  Topped off with cocoa powder. She thought it was outstanding.  My wife Carol decided on the  Sausage, peppers & onions (Mild Italian Sausage slow baked with sweet peppers, onions, marinara sauce and spices with side of pasta). Carol thought the dish was superb. For dessert Carol got the Lemoncello Marscapone Cake. Carol loves lemon and said it was A delightful and light lemon flavored cake. It was and rich and loaded with delicious Lemon flavor.  I got the Veal Parmesan it came with a small dinner salad and pasta w/ marinara sauce. The pasta is extremely high quality-- perfectly cooked. The veal parmesan was tender and prepared nicely. I always judge an Italian restaurant on the Veal Parmesan if they have it or the eggplant parmesan. In this case it was the veal. The dish was classic  Italian fare, nothing really different than what you find on every menu Italian Restaurant in Arizona.  But it was pretty tasty. For dessert I ordered the cheese cake. It was creamy and rich but nothing special.  FOOD: Food was very good. Kathy R. and my wife was impressed with the quality of their dish. As for me I thought the food was good but didn't knock my socks off like I was expecting. While everything tasted fine, I did not taste any heart or soul in the dishes and Italian food normally has a lot of TLC along with heart and soul put into their dishes. SERVICE:Lacey provided us with Tremendous service. PRICE: The prices on the lunch menu wasn't terrible. CONCLUSION: Nice atmosphere.  Relaxed, unpretentious, and comfortable in a way that makes you want to spend time just chatting with friends. The portions were just right for lunch not to big that you left stuffed but not  small where you left hungry. You cannot go home hungry from here.  RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH   The portions were huge, the prices were very reasonable and the food was fantastic!  I would definitely recommend Little Bite of Italy and I'll certainly go back again"}
{"text":"Best Italian place in the Valley! My boyfriend and I go to Little Bite of Italy quite a bit. It is our favorite restaurant! Charming, down home kind of a place!  My boyfriend is half Italian and has been to a lot of Italian restaurants. The sauce is amazing!  My boyfriend gets the veal parmesan and I get the chicken parmesan. He loves how they pound the veal! They even have entertainment on Saturday nights.  Check out their website for details. Great owners, great service and excellent food!  We love Little Bite of Italy! It is also casual so relax!"}
{"text":"Took out of town guest there for dinner last night.  Was totally embarrassed. Asked our server several questions about the menu items.  Her response was either, I don't know, The kitchen won't do that, Don't order that it only comes out good half the time and They will charge you extra.  I was ready to walk out right there.  Finally decided on several menus items.  Asked for a pasta and sauce substitution on a certain dish, that prompted, The kitchen won't do that.  A gentleman came by, assumed he was the owner or manager.  Asked him if we could get the pasta and sauce substation on the dish and he said, No problem.  He conveyed the request to our server.  The dish came out with the right pasta but the wrong sauce.  Let's go back to the beginning.  The Calamari was rubbery and the sauce was burned, sweet pasta sauce.  The stuffed shells were passable, as was the linguine and olive oil.  Originally wanted the clam sauce bu again was told I probably wouldn't get any clams and was good only half the time.  The Pasta sauce was the worst I have ever had and was raised on southern Italian cooking.  Our server came back to the table only once and I had to hunt her down for the desert menus, to go boxes and the check.  Then had to look for her to pick up my payment.  I'm a retired foodie and never left a small tip.  I did last night and I will never return there.  GO ELSEWHERE. T"}
{"text":"It was ok. I went with a large group and I think the waitress was cranky because of it. She was slow getting beverages but the kitchen was relatively quick getting us our food, especially considering the size of the group. It was most definitely overpriced but I liked being able to sit outside. There was love entertainment when I went which was really cool. Food and service were ok, atmosphere was great, overall an average restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here Friday the 13th. Wanted a fish fry.  The worst fish fry I ever had. It was one pice deep fried to death with the skin on. It had no taste was very thin and the tarter sauce was sweet.  One good point, the French frys were good.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Been there twice now.  Will definately go back.  I really don't understand some of the other reviews.  I think way better than Olive Garden and don't have to wait in line forever.  No effing kids either!  Had pizza first time.  Did not need Alka-Seltzer later.  Had veal parmisian tonight.  Great, great, great!  All you can eat fish on Friday nights for $12.  Give it a try.  Not all of us in Sun City are dead yet!"}
{"text":"Although the staff here is very very nice, the food at best is just meh....I visited recently with a friend and found the menu and food to be uninspired. I ordered the soup, salad and breadsticks. First of all, it bagged salad and about a cup of it at that. It's not a bread stick, it's a slice of garlic toast. And the soup, the soup was pretty good. It was semi-homemade chicken noodle soup. It's not unlimited but it is only $5. You do get what you pay for in that respect.  My friend ordered the mostaccoli with meatsauce and salad. The pasta was overdone and the meatsauce was pretty salty.   I suppose for the older crowd that this place attracts in Sun City, this food is great, but honestly, it was nothing special. It wasn't bad...it just wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. We where there an hour before we even got our salads, which by the way were soggy. I went and complained to the manager, and she honestly acted like whatever about it. The waitress came only about 3 times to our table. Eventually we got our food which honestly was alright not worth the $80 we paid. I would rather have gone to Grande Pizza on 91st and union hills for better service and better pricing for food."}
{"text":"Service is good and food isn't bad but 8.50 for a roast beef sandwich is something not worth making the stop for...Add a drink and fries ... Last time for me and the $9 sandwich"}
{"text":"Have to say, the MOST disappointing dining experience ever in the Sun City area. Management does NOT care. Slow service, mediocre food. Won't recommend to anyone and certainly won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food waitress was very attentive to us. This restaurant reminds me of a restaurant we used to eat st in Brooklyn NY. Very family oriented."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for pizza or Italian food when we want to stay close by. The pizza is thin crust with the right amount of toppings. The pasta choices are pretty standard. I had stuffed shells with a side of meatballs. Very good. The other members of the group had eggplant italiano, Mediterranean pasta, and the trio sampler. Everyone had enough to take home for another meal. The service was very good and the outdoor patio comfortable."}
{"text":"Pretty empty place and took a little more time than expected to get a drink order in and finally the soup and sandwich order.  At least the food came out quickly.  Nothing to write home about and don't think I'll go back.  Not worth the time, Peoria is close and better restaurants."}
{"text":"Now the first thing you may want to ask is \"Greg what the fuck were you doing 99th Ave and Greenway?\" or \"99th Ave?  Why the fuck didn't you just drive the extra three miles and go to LA?\"  You would be right in asking me those perfectly reasonable questions.    The answer is that for some reason which I still have not been able to figure out yet is that my girlfriend's parents live out there.  So this Friday it was her step mother's birthday and she wanted to celebrate at this little place in a strip mall in Sun City.  All I could say up to that point is \"Hey, at least it's not a fucking Luby's.\"    So we walk up to this little restaurant and there is patio seating out front and a quaint little dining room inside.  We were early so we decided to belly up to the bar and have a glass of wine. The bar tender carded me which was understandable given that compared to the average patron at this establishment I must have looked like a god damn fetus.  I order a Chardonnay and my girlfriend orders a Sauvignon Blanc.  Mine was passable hers was too sweet.  We had a couple other glasses and when the bill came for 4 glasses of mediocre wine I was more that a little shocked that they cost $26.  Oh well easy come easy go right?    The reservations we had were for a huge table outside as we had about 20 people in our party.  There was live entertainment in the form of this blonde lady about 50 years old not bad looking who has a kind of karaoke set up that she just uses to sing.  I tipped her a few times so she could play some Nancy Sinatra, Stan Getz, etc. and she did a pretty decent job.    The menu was pretty standard Italian fare.  Various pastas and pizzas, etc.  I took a chance and order the Fettucine a la Carbonara.  The reason I say I took a chance is because I have ordered this dish the world over and I have only had about one or two places make it properly.  This was not one of them.  They basically just put bacon over Fettucine Alfredo and called it a night.  Disappointing but at least the clam chowder and pizza was pretty good.    I would have to say the most remarkable thing about this place was these weird really long tubes that they fill up and bring to your table.  The tube has a tap at the bottom that you use to pour the beer.  Very bizarre.    The entertainment got progressively more fun as we drank and drank.  At one point there was this old dude dancing his ass off right there on the patio like he didn't have a care in the world.  I hope I have as much energy when I am his age.  We eventually did the same and danced the twist right there on the patio.  What started out as a pretty mediocre place turned out to be a pretty fun time.    I don't know why the hell anyone reading this would ever find themselves at 99th Ave and Greenway but if you do you should swing by and check it out."}
{"text":"We decided to deviate from the norm last night and decided to check out little bite of italy.  It's tucked away in the back of a strip mall lacks curb appeal.  The interior was more reminiscient of a bowling alley with ugly carpeting and uncomfortable orange and yellow chairs.  Above the bar hangs an Air Cav unit emblem indicating the proprietor spent some time in Nam and it in no way embodies an italian restaurant hopefully the food is good.  We started with an order of toasted ravioli which was actually quite good, My meal included a salad and breadstick (singular).  The salad consisted of tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  Not being a fan of Tomatoes or Onions I reached for the parmesan and made the best of things.    (NOTE: There are these things call croutons, they're crunchy and they're awesome!!!)  I was also served a single lonely breadstick in a basket, feeling guilty I shared the breadstick with my wife.    For dinner I had ordered the linguine with clam sauce.  I ordered a half order but the portion size was still very big.  there was a lot of clam on the pasta, unfortunately the sauce was a bit of a let down and something was off about the taste.  My wife had ordered a stromboli but we couldn't help but think she was eating an oversized hot pocket.  The service was ok, our waiter was young and seemed absent minded and a couple of times we joked about dine and dashing because we were going to catch a movie after.  To be fair it was mothers day and the wait staff may have been off their game.  and the pizza looked good so at some point I'd like to come back and try the pizza.  the pizza will determine whether they gain or lose a star.  If you're in the neighborhood might be worth checking out, but not worth the drive if you're not."}
{"text":"Great food and large portions. Service is always good. We will be going back today for lunch."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had Ossobuco. Nothing to write home about.  Lot of food, dry, no flavor.  Not busy but had to keep asking for service.  My dog is enjoying the bone!  Other Italian food I have purchased here has been really good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best margarita pizza in the West Valley but be warned you must love you some garlic"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Portions are HUGE, beer is cold and very reasonable. Will happily return."}
{"text":"We had there desserts a couple of nights ago and we're intrigued enough to try them for dinner.  We arrived at 7:28 and they said the kitchen was closed.  The sign on the for said they were open till 8. The staff said the kitchen closed at 7:30...which it wasn't. I didn't see the owners around.  Felt like the staff was trying to leave early.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was great, the staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I had the Egg Plant Parmesan served with meat sauce which I enjoyed very much. I will gladly return."}
{"text":"I Love  this place, with my six pack family, we each get our favorites. The staff is wonderful, attentive to our special night out, whether Anniversaries or Birthdays they respond with celebration and joy. We always leave with a smile, full bellies and a bill for less than $125.00....  does not get any better than this..."}
{"text":"Chicken parmesan sandwich was huge, lots of chicken, but a tasteless marinara sauce. Realized it could use more sauce, but for one dollar more, no way. Sandwich by itself, nothing else, not a piece of lettuce or a pickle. Same for my lunch buddy, a lonely sandwich. Do not plan to return."}
{"text":"From what I gather, this is THE place to go on a Saturday night in Sun City. Be prepared for outdoor seating, a sound system, and some geriatric boogie-ing.  The food was alright. We called ahead for takeout, and because of the crowd we had to wait 25 minutes for a pizza and salad. They have a bar with open seats, so OK. Bar was pleasant enough.  Cheese pizza, meh, nothing special. Chicken Caesar was also middle-of-the-road. I get it though, you're catering to an older crowd, and there's probably not much incentive to go nuts with flavors of any sort. Keep it bland, keep 'em coming in."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant about 6-7 times since 2013 when my parents retired here and I come out to visit. I've always had an exceptional meal - my secret - order the thin crust pizza. I have not tried the veal, calamari, etc. Their thin crust pizza is really really good. Try their large with sausage, mushroom, and fresh crushed garlic. I like chicago cut personally. Outstanding. If you want more zagat rated fare, there are many places to visit 30 minutes away, but if you want great tasting comfort food right in the heart of Sun City, try this place out. Oh yeah - full bar, sidewalk seating if you want, and quirky live music on the patio from time to time. This is Sun City - it beats the heck out of the buffets your parents may want to take you to - tell them, take me to that little italy place with the sidewalk seating. The servers know us and have been efficient every time I've gone from 12:00 noon to 3:00 in the afternoon to 7:00 pm at night. I've had pizza deep dish in Chicago on Wabash Ave and thin crust in New York Times Square and authentic in Vienna, Austria and this place makes good thin crust pizza. Try it. I go at least once each time I visit the parents, and this is my first yelp review - I've really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"The manager needs some basic skills. She sent our server on an errand off site before he could cash us out so we had to wait because no one else is allowed. Finally she grabbed my credit card and took it to the front never to return with it. Once the server returned he brought me another check. The best thing about this place is the lovely lady bus boy that cleared our table and tried to get us moving along."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This restaurant is located in Sun City. It is unlikely any of you will find yourself here in the near future and hopefully not even in the far future, as this is where vitality goes to die. But if you find yourself with a flat tire out in the middle of BFE or need to take Grandma out for a night on the town (bedtime by 8pm at the latest, sonny!), this is a pretty respectable choice. And in full confidentiality, it managed to surprise me. -----------------------------------------------------------  I can't fathom why, but my family resides in the suburban sprawl of Peoria, which happens to border Sun City. I haven't been out to this haven for golf carts and cataracts since I used to live way out in northwest Glendale, but for my stepmother's birthday she wanted to eat at Little Bite of Italy. So we pile in to the car for the mini road trip out there from Tempe.  Having arrived early, Mr. Man and I saunter up to the bar and (gasp!) get carded. Seeing how we were mere babes in the womb compared to some of the patrons there, this was no big surprise. What was surprising was the house sauvignon blanc I ordered that tasted like sweet tarts. And cost a whopping $6.50 for a bitsy little glass. Whatevs. Old people's livers don't work as well as mine, so I can see how they can get away with upping the price.  I was also surprised at this freaky gigantic beer tap that was ordered for the table. It seemed like a little bit of frat boy flava delivered to a demographic that could be their parents or grandparents. It was a wicked cool cylindrical device that held three pitchers and had a chilled center at the base. A gigantic bong of of booze if you will.  Since I'm indecisive I went with the sampler: meat lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. Aside from the fact that it needed salt (again, my blood pressure probably isn't as high as the older folks), the meal was pretty tasty. The alfredo was lackluster, but I've rarely had good alfredo from a restaurant so it was no surprise. I also grazed on a piece of The Works pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, red and green peppers. That was far superior and the left over pizza reheated to a lovely crisp in the oven the next day.  The entertainment was probably the highlight of the evening. There was a 50+ (don't want to offend by guessing wrong), petite female performer in what could have doubled as a figure skating outfit singing her little heart out on stage. She had a great voice, oozed mature sex appeal all over the male customers (no need for viagra that night) and took requests like the pro she was. All ages were shakin' what their momma gave them up in front of the stage, me included, and it was a surprising amount of fun.  I never knew Sun City could be so spry! Respect."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, crisp salad, nice environment with live music and big patio."}
{"text":"The male owner or manager of this joint is a total ass, very rude, and I have been here multiple times and he continues to be an asshole.  The food here is really good and the prices are great, the atmosphere is pleasant and the female owner or manager is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Wow! People from surrounding areas seem kind of mad at this place. It is not a dance club. It is Sun City folks, not Scottsdale. This place is about fun and people watching.   The pizza is great! We have had the white pizza several times and love the thin crust and toppings.   First time we went, we were looking for something to do, So I called and asked if they had music. The woman replied, that they had 'R&B' that night. We went expecting a band. Instead, we got Ronnie and Bobbie  (?) who sing to songs AND wear costumes to fit the mood! It is very quirky, but fun. Tons of regulars hang out to dance and visit. we felt kind of out of place, since we were 10 - 20 years younger than the crowd, but they said hi as they walked by and made us feel included. The singers handed out small flags to wave during their rendition of 'Boogie- Woogie Bugle Boy' So, I got up and waved mine, mortifying my GF. Good fun!"}
{"text":"The food was good they were slow on refills. But I was trying to be understanding and then as we were leaving our server which is a blonde girl with her hair tied that came out chasing after us asking if we like the service and why we didn't tip. I have never been chase down by a server demanding for tip and reply when we reply why we didn't then she rolled her eyes at us and immediately leaves.  I hope everyone there is not like that.  that's how our moment was ruined and our experience there. will not be eating there again"}
{"text":"Love this place. Its like a neighborhood bar, but all grown up. You can enjoy a nice delicious meal. The entertainment is always great. Make reservations, gets crowded during the summer months. Service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Well... I stopped in on a Thursday night. I was visiting a family member who was briefly in town and she was staying near this restaurant. The reviews seemed good so I figured it was worth a try.  It's located deep in a strip mall. The restaurant is a bit dated and stuffy. Everyone dining was seated on the patio, so we sat there, too. There was a gentlemen playing music on a stereo or DJ equipment (not sure - sorry!) and he was singing with the music, which made for cute ambiance. Unfortunately, this is where the pleasantries seemed to end.  After being seated for 15 minutes, I went inside to find a waitress to take our order. It irritated me that a large party was seated next to us after we were seated and their order was taken before ours. After waiting 50 minutes for food, the waitress said their computer system had died and the order didn't send to the kitchen, so it would be a few more minutes before we got our food. It was after 9:30 PM at this point, and I was starving.  The food: food was extremely average. Baked ziti was very simple. Fettuccine alfredo needed some salt but was OK. After finishing our food, I took the liberty of going inside, finding our waitress, and asking for the check because it was almost 10 PM and I had a good drive ahead of me to get back home.  Prices were relatively reasonable, but service was abysmal. Not going back."}
{"text":"Truly a great thin crust pizza, best in the valley, very tasty crust, not soggy and wet, just the right amount of crispy. Toppings are good and plentiful(Sausage & mushroom). Sauce tastes good, not overpowering, you can taste pizza in every bite, and not just sauce. Ask to have it cut in squares, so much better......"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my grandma out for some dinner and since this place is a block or so from her house, we decided to give it a try.   Upon arriving we could tell that it was busy, but there were still empty tables. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes to be seated and then another few for our waitress to take our drink orders (water, nothing from the bar). At this point I should have taken better notice of the patrons around us. Nobody had food in front of them and several tables looked anxious as if they had been waiting for some time. Our waitress returned to take our orders and then we started what would be the longest wait in restaurant history...  We literally waited for 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received our dinner salads. 'Oh good sign' I thought as we received our salads, thinking dinner couldn't be too far behind... well I was wrong. We sat and sat and sat for another 25 minutes. Eventually I told my hard of hearing grandma that I was going to settle up on our waters and side salads and we would go grab some Arby's. She agreed and I hunted down our waitress. When I told her I wanted to tab out, she looked at me with disbelief and stated she would have to get the manager. Then she proceeded to clean a table. I was disgusted and ready to go. And I would have too, if my sweet little grandma wasn't sitting there. Our waitress returned and asked if we could wait 2 more minutes. I looked around and mentioned there were at least 2 other tables ahead of us. She stated that they ordered pizza and it takes longer than our orders. A few more minutes passed and our plates came out.   The food was nothing fancy, but did taste alright. I had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti.   Next time I take grandma to dinner we will make the drive to another place and avoid the excessive waits."}
