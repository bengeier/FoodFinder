{"text":"Overall, we had a positive experience.  Baja Soul has a rather unfortunate location. Although they are in Birkdale, they are tucked in the back as opposed to on the main drag, so you will likely only see the place if you are purposefully looking for it. Once we finally found it, we went in and stood at the front and looked around and saw just a few diners, but no staff.  After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.  I'd say give this place a shot if you are a fan of trying different kinds of tacos. The prices are very reasonable, but I think they could get more business if they would advertise more and let people know, \"Hey, we're back here.\""}
{"text":"Order the Swanky Steak Taco.....YUM!!!  My other two favorites are the tableside guac and the corn.  Excellent fresh ingredients make this spot stand out. Great customer service and excellent unique Mexican food."}
{"text":"The mexican food here is billed as \"adding California and Southwestern twists\" regarding flavor. I did not think so in the least. It seems more based on Caribbean mexican flavors (with mangos, plantains, etc.). Even though I like that too, I was expecting flavors from home (as I am from southern Cal).   I was disappointed that they use flour tortillas for their tacos. These were rather tasteless. Fresh, corn torts would have been a far better choice.   The ceviche was served in a martini-style glass. This makes all the delicious lime juice run to the bottom. Now the ceviche on top is dry and lacking in tangy lime flavor. I had to ask for extra lime to fix it. It should be served in flat-style dish so as to keep the fish in the juices.  The chips and salsa was very good. The black beans rather bland. They were supposed to have serrano chilis in them but I could not taste even a hint of serrano spice or heat. The guacamole was okay. The mango pico de gallo that came with my tacos was very good - not typically southwest however.   The fish in the tacos, taken separately, was not very flavorful. It needed the pico de gallo. The same was true of my daughter's shrimp tacos.   I was hoping for some true west coast mexican food but this is not it."}
{"text":"Vey good tacos!! The street corn was amazing!!  Also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and it was delicious! Got the mahi tacos and a swanky steak taco! They were both phenominal. Service was fast and everyone was friendly and helped explain everything since it was our first time there. House salsa was good. Also tried the guacamole, corn salsa, and there pineapple habanero salsa which were all pretty good.   My wife had the gringo chicken tacos which were decent. The fried plantains were by far the best part of the meal. Would definily go back."}
{"text":"Great place! We had excellent service from Lucky and I had the Maji Tacos! Spectacular fresh food and an all around great experience!"}
{"text":"Started off having several great experiences here, but as of late the service has fallen off a cliff. The food is good, the bar is okay, prices are moderate to high and the decor pretty cool. After one of the worst overall service experiences I have ever had, we will likely be avoiding Baja Soul going forward. They screwed up every facet of our dinner, starting with drinks and proceeding through the entrees. The kids never did receive their sides before I had finally had enough and requested the tab. To their credit they comped our meal and apologized. While I appreciate the gesture I would rather they took my money and met reasonable expectations."}
{"text":"I wanted to take the time to email you about my experience at your restaurant this past Saturday night, April 28th. My wife and I arrived around 7:00pm.  It was awesome to be seated right away.  Here's my concern.  How does your restaurant stay in business wit the prices you charge?  $8.98 for a margarita is highway robbery!  More than that it's the audacity to charge $10.95 for two steak tacos and my wife had two other tacos for $8.95.  I know of at least two restaurants that have been in your space before you.  I foresee you establishment not last at those prices.  I know the rent there is HIGH.  I know two owners of other restaurants in that mall.  When you have Qdoba serving their tacos for 1/3 of the price and charge less for beer, why would anyone want to come to you.  We won't be back!  I will post this comment on every website that I could critique your establishment.  You absolutely have to lower your prices or run more specials or get ready to shut your doors.  Are you aware of the struggles are economy is faced with?  Sincerely,  Ripped off at Baja"}
{"text":"The food was good, though the menu is limited mostly to different tacos. The service was quick. Seating was limited and pretty \"cozy. \" fish tacos and guacamole were good. The beef nachos were really good - tasty cheese!"}
{"text":"Another good experience at Baja Soul, Birkdale, off the circle...you gotta go find it! How can you go wrong with two street tacos and a side for $7.95 at lunch? We added table-side guac--outstanding as usual--and street corn was its typical saucy delicious mess (extra napkins needed). Only thing I would do different: ceviche in wife's martini glass was DELICIOUS... my ceviche tacos with mango and mango habanero sauce was confusing. That sauce is KILLER good on many things but it basically put to death the ceviche in my tacos. I will keep my ceviche to the savory/tangy side next time, avoiding the sweet and heat."}
{"text":"The food here is fairly mediocre.  I tried the shrimp and mahi mahi tacos along with Mexican street corn and plantain sides.  While the plantains were delicious, the street corn was essentially an ear of grilled corn covered with a bit of cream/cheese sauce.  The sauces on the tacos were tasty and the vegetables were fresh, but the fish (shrimp and mahi mahi) was extremely bland.  The overarching theme at Baja Soul is a lack of seasoning and flavor."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, which was our first visit.  Will be back.  We shared mahi tacos in corn tortillas and shrimp tacos in flour tortillas, both were well executed. I think I would go with the corn tortillas next trip and it would be a toss up on which fish was better.  The mahi was a little spicier.  Service was quick and attentive.  All the food was very fresh tasting.  Glad to have this addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have visited Baja Soul multiple times since they have opened, and they remain a consistent favorite for us at Birkdale. Technically, I would rate them 3.5 stars, but I like to round up rather than down.  Service has always been attentive, friendly, and efficient.  This is my go to place for fresh tacos, when I also want to sit and enjoy an upbeat restaurant atmosphere. Yes, there are cheaper taco and/or mexican places in Huntersville, such as the red taco truck (of whom we are also a fan), La Unica (which we also think is good) and of course Qdoba, (I never eat there). Part of what you are paying for at Baja Soul is the convenience (to Birkdale), and atmosphere. I am glad they retained the tables with computers in them, this is one restaurant we can take our daughter and actually sit and relax at the end of a meal (and before the meal too!).   The complimentary salsa is out of this world good and my favorite restaurant salsa in this area, particularly for something that is complimentary. I typically order the seafood tacos, especially the Yucatan shrimp and mahi mahi. I was delighted to finally find somewhere locally with platanos on the menu; both the Mexican street corn and plantains are very good.  The tacos come standard with flour tortillas, but you can substitute corn tortillas . It is mentioned on the menu, and I have never been charged extra to upgrade to the corn tortilla.   We have ordered the tableside guacamole once, when there was a free coupon in the Clipper magazine. I would never pay full price for this, but it is very good. The great thing about having it prepared table side is that it is customizable. Want extra cilantro? They'll toss in as much as you want. More chili peppers? It's all yours.   My only real criticism of Baja Soul is the bar. The drinks are incredibly overpriced. I ordered a margarita on one visit, and it was the smallest margarita I've ever had, filled with ice, and not very good. I have also tried the mojito and it was mediocre. On our last visit, we did enjoy the 1/2 price bottle of wine night, but typically avoid ordering drinks here after the first two failed to impress."}
{"text":"Friendly service, unique atmosphere, food seemed to be very fresh. Both orders of chips and salsa had that fresh fried taste, and were lightly coated with sea salt. Sierra Fish Taco's were very tasty, not over fried or greasy, full of flavor, just right. Swanky Taco's were a hit with my GF, which I stole a taste of, and agreed. Nice selection of craft beers on tap, as well as authentic Cuban style Mojitos."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and brief.  And I may also get flamed for stating the following:  THIS PLACE SERVES BETTER FOOD THAN CABO FISH TACO.  There. I said it.  Flame Suit On!  The food is delicious, very fresh, the fish was not dry (cough cough cabo...) and the sides are darn good too.  The Street Style Corn was delicious.  The drink menu is really good too. I had a Caipirinha and it was well made.  The margaritas also have a really fresh/different taste to them as well. Doesn't taste like it comes out of a bucket like most margaritas around the area.  Pretty sure it's all freshly made.   Our server was great, very prompt and attentive.  But I did notice slight chaos around the restaurant.  I think once this place get it's groove on the service side, it will be alright.  Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Cool concept with the tables that are interactive BUT out of the 3x I have been there 3x they did not properly work.  They were out of a couple of the menu items each time as well and the food was medicore AT BEST.  I would go there again if they cut their prices in half....maybe.  Service was also something to be desired."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I am personally in love with their ceviche tacos with mango! But even before you get to your entree the salsa they offer you, and happily refill. is an awesome setup for the high five your mouth is about to receive.   The staff is great and very attentive and always up for a little conversation. The whole atmosphere makes you feel like you are hanging out at a sea-side eatery instead of sitting in Huntersville. I do my best to stop by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us recently tried this place based on a friend's recommendation. We were lucky enough to be able to sit in the back room since we had so many people with us. They recently upgraded the tables in the back so they are all digital. You can watch You tube videos, take pictures of yourselves, email them to you, etc. It makes dining a lot more fun with a group. I ended up having just the street corn since I had previously eaten, but everything else everyone looked great also. The street tacos are a good choice and they have several options. This would also be a great place to pick up some food on a weekend night and listen to the live music down the street."}
{"text":"The atomosphere is a mix of Sugar Skulls/Dia de los Muertos, surfing and aqua marine life. You can also play games on their gaming console tables. The menu is small which to me is a good sign that they specialize in a select few which means the food SHOULD be on point. But really it's average fish tacos. It's the only dine-in \"taco spot\" in the area so I'm happy. Service is nice and fairly decent speed. Their staff seems knowledgeable about every thing on the menu. They are known for their gaucamole they make right at their table but honestly I don't taste anything in there that you can't make yourself."}
{"text":"Food was very good, drink were kinda high though. I'll agree with the service though, her was nice but very inattentive.  There were only 2 other tables and one was being helped by the bartender. Don't know if they were locals or what but  the one table had no waits at all. The other table shared our frustration though. I will go back, like I sad the food was great, just won't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the mahi mahi tacos.  My whole table enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  My husband and I ate here on Saturday with our 2 year old and everyone enjoyed their food.  The atmosphere is fun and the service was great.  We started with the Chili Con Queso Dip (yummy!) and then I had Chicken & Rajas Quesadilla (delicious and SO much food - it was stuffed!) and my husband had the fish tacos.    The interactive tables are a neat idea, but don't 100% match up with the menu at this point - which I'm sure is just a glitch as they work things out.  The interactive tables are great, however, if you have kids because they can play games and control the tv. Also, if you need your server or want to order something extra, you can do it right there at the table rather than waiting.  The location in Birkdale is unfortunate since it seems tucked away at the back but I hope this one makes it! I fully intend to dine here again!"}
{"text":"okay food, I will probably go here again when I am tired of the other restaurants in the area. The service is good as long as you don't get a little guy named Lucky. He gets very personal with you when it is time for lunch and will sit down in your booth and chat about random shit. Otherwise, go for it.."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Baja Soul on 6/9/12. I had no idea that the restaurant was tucked back in Birkdale Village. We were pleasantly surprised and will be back. The mahi tacos were great and my husband also enjoyed his shrimp avocado tacos. The service was attentive and quick.   Just a note to those raising concerns about the price...I feel that 8.95 for fresh seafood tacos is fair and the chips and salsa were complimentary. If you want cheap, fast foodesque Mexican fare, you should go to Qdoba. Baja Soul is a nice addition to the Huntersville dining scene."}
{"text":"Baja Soul recently opened in Birkdale Village, in a location previously occupied by T1 Tapas (and the more recent iPub).    There were both positives and negatives about dining at Baja Soul.  First, let's get the negatives out of the way:  - Once we were seated, we waited for ten minutes before finally having to flag down a server to ask for help. The restaurant was only half full this night, and were disappointed that we had to do this. - The chicken quesadillas are made with dark meat.  I'm NOT a fan of dark meat, either! - Sides are extra. I tried the plantains, which are usually thinly sliced and cooked until they are soft in a sweet syrup. Baja Soul's were cut into large chunks that were less flavorful than I was expecting. - Their prices are a bit high. I know the rent at Birkdale is high, but when I compare Baja Soul to other high-end Mexican restaurants such as Prickly Pear or Cantina 1511, Baja is a tad below the competition.  On a positive note, here are some of the good things we experienced here: - The decor is cool and the restaurant is quite cozy. - Once the server realized her mistake, she gave us great attention the rest of the evening. - Our pork nachos and the carne asada tacos were quite good.   - The house salsa is excellent, and it's not necessary to purchase their specialty salsas unless you want to try their unique flavors.  Since they are so new, we'll likely give them another chance.  They certainly have a large menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food here. EVERYTHING is made fresh in house from the salsa to the whole roasted hand pulled chicken even the sour mix for the margaritas. Every time I go I'm pleasantly surprised. The wait staff and the managers are always friendly and personable. I recommend Baja soul to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Another disappointing Mexican joint in Charlotte.  This place wasn't particularly bad. It's just...not worth the price. Though, I will admit, they have a decent $5 margarita."}
{"text":"We've been back here a couple of times since my first review and I really have to address some stuff. First off, I have to say that the carne asada tacos are pretty slammin'. If you like steak then this taco is a must-have.The steak is cooked perfectly for a taco, in that it's diced small yet the chunks are big enough to retain that steaky flavor, and the chunks are super tender. The rice and beans are decent, as the rice and beans are served in the same bowl and tossed with salsa. I generally prefer the yellow rice by itself, but it was still good with the salsa mixed in. If you're not big on meat, my wife really enjoyed the avacado taco, and it was plenty filling.  The food has never really been an issue here. What is an issue is the service. Our first time here we happened to have a very good server, but the past few times we were here the service has been pretty much a miss. For starters, the servers never prepare the \"tableside\" guac in front of you. It doesn't taste as good as it did the first time so I'm wondering whether it's still made fresh in house or if they are now bringing in some pre-made guac. The servers also tend to be inattentive, even when the place is dead. If it was one server it would be one thing, but we've encountered this a few times with a different server each time. Management really needs to step in and get the servers trained correctly or at least keep on them if they want to maintain business.  Baja Soul serves up great food, yet without the service to back it up, it's hard to look forward to coming back. If the waitstaff doesn't get their act together I can see the restaurant facing the same fate as iPub and the other places that didn't make it in that location. We'll still head back here if we're in Birkdale and want some tacos, but it will need to be one heck of a craving. Hopefully by the time we return the waitstaff will be a bit more prepared and competent."}
{"text":"This is one of those benefit of the doubt 3 star reviews since it's based on only one visit and takes into account that my wife went another time with some friends and had nothing but good things to say from that night.  In terms of the food, there were some definite hits and no real misses.  There were however some \"ok but i wouldn't say it's a hit\" items.  The salsa that came with chips to start the meal was very good.  Nice depth and complexity of flavors and a decent, not overpowering, bit of heat.  I ordered the Tacos al Pastor (pulled pork) and my wife got the Yucatan Shrimp tacos.  My tacos were good, not great with decent flavor but some fatty and/or dry pieces of pork made them less than special.  I tried my wife's tacos and thought they were quite good with fresh, firm and tasty shrimp.  She got some salsa on the side that had pineapple and habenero and really complemented the tacos well.  The downers on this trip, unfortunately fit with some other reviewers experiences so am hoping it's not a trend.  We arrived around 7:45 on a slow Thursday night and literally stood there, with another couple ahead of us, for 5 minutes with nary a hi, hello or, be right with you.  Eventually someone asked if we had been helped and from there it took another 3 minutes to get seated in a 3/4 empty restaurant.  Another 3-4 minutes and we had menus, 5+ before we were asked for a drink order at which time we also had the server take our dinner order.  The drinks, a classic mojito and a gold margarita took another 10 minutes to arrive.  By then, the manager did come by and tell us the drinks were comped and he admitted they were understaffed and the bartender was also waiting tables.  It was a good thing at least one of the drinks was comped because the margarita was literally undrinkable.  Not sure what she put in that she shouldn't have or left out that she should have put in but, just gross!  All this said, the food was good enough, and I like this type of food enough, to give them one more chance.  Am hopeful  for a better overall result on the next trip."}
