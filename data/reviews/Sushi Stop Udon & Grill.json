{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but they were not open when they said they would be... called several times and no one answered. Sucks because I drove out of my way to try this spot out ... oh well."}
{"text":"We just stopped in, my husband was craving Katsu and I Udon. Our 3 yr old had the sashimi and my 11 yr old had avocado salmon rolls. Rolls are HUGE 1 roll here = 2 at most other places almost too big. The Tuna tacos were very good too. We eat a lot of sushi and the fish here was fresh and tasty. Great service, We will be back."}
{"text":"Omg this spot is amazing. The sushi was the best I ever had. I am from Kansas city and compared to this place we Kansas folks are being jipped in KC. The size and amount of food was awesome and the taste matched. I got the Pop corn Lobster roll, the Mesa Roll and the Rainbow Roll. The environment was nice, the service was quick and the woman who served us was super sweet and so precious. She was so nice and she made the experience so inviting. The chef was friendly and on point with taste and size. When I say the BEST I totally believe this was one of the best places I have ever eaten sushi at and I eat a lot. If I could give more stars I would. It is a must try when visiting AZ."}
{"text":"Deduction of one star due to feedback from owner. Yeah, I did eat at your place. It was ~$45 and I was hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch all the time. Their prices are reasonable, and their rolls are huge. Plus they have sushi burritos. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before I ordered because the portions are HUGE! I've never seen bigger sushi rolls before. 

This place is lovely, adorable and very tasty! So glad to have a wonderful new sushi place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you have allergies.  I ended up rushing to urgent care for anaphylactic shock from cross contamination-assumably from shrimp which I am highly allergic to.  My meal consisted of veggie tempura, avocado roll and cucumber roll.  There should have been no reason for shrimp, shell fish or any kind of fish what so ever to end up in my meal."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place, she spoke about how welcoming the owners were and how much care they show for their food. I
Felt exactly that!
The lady did warn us about how big the rolls were but we decided we were up to the challenge... I have to say 
Big means big at sushi stop!"}
{"text":"We came back in on a Friday night with a larger group and they finally updated their business hours! Woohoo! Service was great and so was the food. Keep it up :)"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service the food is just as good. Freshly made and beyond great presentation. If your thinking about trying I definitely suggest you do. The restrooms are clean as well"}
{"text":"Wow. Just amazing. Seriously. Giant rolls with a ton of meat. Tasted great. I can't wait to go back. So glad to see a local mom and pop do so well on service and quality. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for many reasons.  Primarily because it is literally a \"Mom & Pop shop\" with the owner's (husband and wife) being the only \"employees\".  He is the chef and is Japanese (a rarity in local sushi restaurants), and she runs the front of the house.  I have been there 4 times now, and wanted to reserve my review until I was sure that it wasn't a fluke.  4 straight great meals in a row can't be lucky.  Each time I went I ordered something standard, for example, spicy tuna roll or assorted sushi/sashimi.  All were above average in quality and taste.  More importantly, the rolls were enormous.  To the point where it was nearly impossible to fit one in my big mouth all at once.  That's not the typical tiny rolls served at most places!  I also threw caution to the wind each time and asked her to pick something for me.  Each time she chose something different (I'm pretty sure she didn't remember me, nor what she chose each previous time).  One time it was the Poké bowl.  Another time it was salmon belly.  The first two I don't remember, but they were delicious.  I also ordered the Udon bowl.  Just a simple soup with thick udon style noodles.  I don't know for sure if the noodles were homemade or not, but they were perfectly cooked, simple, and tasty.  The very best part is when you get your bill (along with Japanese candy).  It is as low a price as I've ever paid for fresh sushi!
I recommend this place without reservation, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, food is good, sashimi is fresh, and they have crazy portion size which is literally could feed two people at one time.  Love here."}
{"text":"Very clean, very nice, comfortable environment, very good service, and best of all it's FRESH! I don't give reviews out often but I'd give this place a 10 star if I could!"}
{"text":"Quaint family operated tremendous quality. We stopped going to the former spots. Completely. If you love sushi and Japanese food try Sushi Stop. You'll fall in love with this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new at least to us. Our second visit tonight and they are just as good as the 1st consistent excellent service! The sushi rolls are triple the size of any roll at every other sushi restaurant and the prices are lower! I was hesitant about writing a review because I don't want anyone finding out about this place because it truly is a hidden gem but I would hate for fellow sushi lovers to miss out on this place and hate for this lovely couple to not succeed as a business! So bring your friends and family and prepare to leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"We just finished dance lessons and wanted some \"good\" food. Found Sushi Stop in Yelp and decided to give it a try. I've live in Japan twice for about 3 years and this place is authentic is not only authentic, but arguably the best Japanese Food I've had  in the East Valley. It's their grand opening so they appear to be just getting started, but once word gets around they will Be THE happening place.  I would like a glass of ice with my coke but it still wasn't enough to drop them a whole star."}
{"text":"This Is my favorite little \"Spot\" the couple that owns it are awesome and out of cali. They are sweet and giving. The food is wonderful and wonderfully priced!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great, but what gets them a 5 is the other options.  It's really hard to find good Japanese curry.  These guys did it amazingly well and the portions are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We stepped in here a week or two ago, around 530pm, on a Friday.
It's small on the inside - a long row of two-top tables goes down the length of the dining area, with some quirky bar-style seating along one wall.
The menu is fairly self-explanatory. We got three sushi rolls, and they were enormous. We got the Mexican roll, one with spicy tuna on the inside and salmon on the top, and an eel and cucumber roll. All but the spicy tuna were filled with lots of krab mix - a decent mix, not soupy, not too dry. But, the amount is... there's like 1.5 - 2 inches (diameter) of krab mix inside the rolls. The eel was okay, the avocado was okay. The spicy tuna is that real smooth type, almost tastes like it's a reconstituted mix as opposed to fresh tuna. The salmon was okay, although it had that metallic lemon type flavor salmon sometimes has.
Overall, it's a great value for the money. If you know what you're getting into, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a basic California roll, go here. Quick serve for lunch, go here. If you want expensive (and excellent) fancy shmancy sushi, go to Shimogamo.
That being said, I look forward to trying the other menu items like the katsu and the udon. I suspect they may be a little better.
Still though, I'd return here without hesitation."}
{"text":"Great prices and the rolls are huge! Wish they served alcohol and had more seating.the chef came over and asked how everything was.Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great, little mom and pop shop. The sushi rolls are amazing! Everything form the california roll to the dobson roll... all delicious and the prices are amazing!!! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great traditional food with a very non-traditional twist! Loved the enormous fire crunchy sushi burrito and the spicy tuna taco's. The scallop sushi and veggie tempura appetizers were also delicious. Our waitress recommended to split the burrito and I'm glad we followed her recommendation - they are enormous. Nice to know that in the future we can split the 13 dollar burrito for a tasty and affordable meal! Definitely will be recommending this spot to friends when they're looking for huge portions of Japanese food."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing I didn't stop to take a picture. Sorry. But the portions are huge, the ingredients fresh, and the husband and wife who own and run this place and incredibly sweet. We've been here twice now to kill time and both times we've left happy. Plan on sharing cause right now we're fighting over who's gonna finish the last pieces since we're both full."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Mexican roll, tiger roll and the jalapeño bomb. The rolls are bigger compared to your average sushi spot. Cook and server were very personable and friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and thought I will try it out. I had a spicy tuna  taco. It's tuna with spicy sauce and a wonton shell! SO YUMMY !!! I loved it. Then I had a Mac DADDY ROLL. I loved it. I am picky on sushi places but this place is amazing! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. The Sashimi is excellent. 

The rolls are good but GIANT. Too fat around to eat in a dignified manner, so not a good choice for a first date.

Cooked food was okay. Will be returning to try soup as it looked good. I was jealous of other patrons who ordered it."}
{"text":"Stopped in this small ma and pa sushi joint because it was so close. Fresh fish, delicious flavors. Definitely going back. No alcohol though.."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and neat little spot, great service and really decent pricing... it's our new little favorite"}
{"text":"When I watch \"Finding Nemo,\" I can't help but notice how delicious Nemo and Dory look. Give me that fish! 

I like it here. Portions are big, the fish is fresh, and the husband and wife team are the nicest people. We've had so much here. I'm talking about their sushi burritos, their ramen, the tostada, the katsu curry, the sushi, etc. Everything is good and we have never been disappointed by anything we have ordered.

We have gotten to know the sushi chef and his wife. The chef has quite the impressive history of working with Iron Chef Morimoto to note. You should definitely have a chat with him if you get the chance.

This isn't my favorite sushi place but it's my favorite in Arizona."}
{"text":"5 star for a Sushi place in Mesa, AZ?  Look, it's not Masa, but it's also not $1k per person.  Food is of a very high quality.  Owners care about their product and are present and attentive.   The presentation of the food was reflective of thoughtful preparation and a care about what was being served.  

Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sushi stop udon and grill is a hidden gem! A tight and cozy little sushi joint at the SWC of Dobson and Guadalupe, you'll find ample parking but limited seating due to the space limitation. A small TV provides and love radio provides entertainment and they have booster and high chairs so bring the little ones. Sushi roll are very large portions so come VERY hungry or just order 1-2 rolls. Decent menu options, including poki bowls, ramen, udon, fried and regular sushi, and a handful of appetizers. Overall clean ambiance and friendly employees."}
{"text":"Ordered take out but I definitely need to dine in. I ordered a burrito bowl and the thing was huge, half of the burrito roll needed both hands. Stuffings were good, fresh and very tasty. The location seemed very clean and the two people there (cashier and cook) were very friendly. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Services was slow! But the food was great! Meals are huge and well priced. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a take out order and called it in right as they opened. The cashier was kind and courteous and answered all my questions about pricing and substitutions. As someone who has worked in a sushi restaurant I'm a little picky about my sushi. The sushi was delicious and the rolls were huge!! Definitely will be returning to try other rolls! I wish they served alcohol! Some sake with my sushi would of been perfect!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite for inexpensive sushi. I ordered the tempura udon. My partner got the curry. We split a California roll. Everything tasted great, was well prepared, and fresh. Some ordering advice--the curry portion was more than enough for two people. Any one thing on the menu is. The rolls say six pieces but they are huge--like 2 to 3 times the size of a normal roll. As others have mentioned, the place is small and is run by a husband and wife. You will wait forever for a table at peak weekend times--go early or late. The service is exceptional friendly but given how busy the couple is, you might go without things like individual plate for your sushi. Still, given the price and quality--totally worth it:)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, very good food, had the \"Mexican Roll\", \"Rainbow Roll\", and (2) \"California Roll\". The Roll size were larger than what I am use too, the were prepared well, within a decent amount of time. All tasted fresh, even though it was close to closing time. The staff did not seem to mind that we were there close to closing, which is always a good thing in my book. No alcoholic beverages are sold, but that isn't a \"bad thing\". Will definitely go back next time I want some sushi. The price is good, when it was said and done, 4 rolls later, edamame, and 3 drinks we paid $37. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"While the shop is small, don't be fooled--the portions are definitely huge. Every time my family and I come here we love the service and the food. The sushi rolls and poke bowls are always prepared diligently; you can definitely tell that everything is made fresh. As for the katsu entrees, the tray is massive and the meat is always tender, never dry. I love coming here and exploring their menu."}
{"text":"We frequent this location specifically for the spicy tuna tacos, they are FANTASTIC. The next favorite is the Jalapeno Bomb.
Most of the rolls are great however I have found that any of the cooked sushi rolls come out overdone and rubbery, I ordered a roll that I had to throw away because it was simply not edible. SO, we just don't order anything cooked here (aside from the Jalapeno Bomb). It won't deter us!
The restaurant portion is small but clean, kinda cramped at times so we typically opt to take out.  
Glad they popped up, its been pretty great so far."}
{"text":"Wow! I normally don't write reviews but this place took my breath away. Preface, I love sushi, I have a sushi tattoo, I eat so much damn sushi. This place has taken my breath away. I had a bowl of tonkotsu miso ramen which was to die for and a Mexican Spicy Roll. Oh, my, god. It was a spicy tuna/shrimp tempura roll from their specialty roll menu and it was SOOOO good. Huge portions, fresh taste, super friendly staff. Please go here! It's a small hole in the wall that you will NOT want to miss."}
{"text":"I love the fried rolls at Sushi Stop! They're very large and so delicious. The owners are so nice and they give hi-chew candy with their orders which is a huge plus. Check out the Mesa roll and the Spciy Tuna taco. A must for people who love Tuna."}
{"text":"I love coming to this little sushi restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, and the owners are always super nice. The rolls are huge. I usually get one of their bowls (the Washington and Rainbow are my favorites) which are pretty substantial. I always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Sushi Stop is my favorite sushi take-out place! They have yummy sushi bowls/burritos/tostadas. I like to get the Washington bowl and husband likes their tostadas. The bowls are huge and they usually last me two meals. Not bad for $10. Plus their staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try somewhere new for sushi so we decided on this place because there's basically 5 stars across the board. We went on Mothers Day and luckily they were not busy. The restaurant is located in a strip mall but it's pretty easy to locate because they have a huge banner. Anyway..we ordered a California roll, crunchy roll (shrimp tempura), mixed vegetable appetizer and udon noodles. To be honest, I was not a fan of the food. The rolls are huge but they were so big that I couldn't eat them in one bite and that's just not my cup of tea. I didn't even know where to start when eating the rolls but after dissecting them, they were generally tasty. Probably won't be back but they do give you Hi-Chew's when you leave ;)"}
{"text":"The rolls are large and taste great. The burrito is the size of getting an actual burrito. This place is welcoming and very accommodating since I can't have any spicy sauces. They also have soy paper for those who don't like seaweed or just prefer otherwise. It's $1 for soy paper substitutions. They have a good variety of food from raw, baked, burritos, and bowls."}
{"text":"So today I decided to go to this Sushi place. First time I had the Tostada, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll and the Udon soup. Everything was GREAT! Today I ordered the Shrimp Tempura which it was simple but good.  I also ordered the Dynamite Roll which was AMAZING!!! And last item was the Spicy Tuna Hand Roll again! Their portions are great and the price is more than just reasonable. I would highly recommend this place.
And by the way... I never give reviews on Yelp. This is my first and maybe the last review. I don't like criticizing food from home. I like to do it face to face. But as I was enjoying my Dynamite Roll I had to stop to express how good this place is.

Last but not least... the owners are so friendly and they actually make you feel like you're special to them.

One word to describe this place... AWESOME!

Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi is super fresh.  I've tried the salmon and yellowtail sashimi, salmon nigiri, spicy tuna roll, and today I just went back to try their Udon.  All of it is delicious and very well done. The owners said, when I was talking with them, that they had a restaurant previously in Los Angeles and had recently moved out here.  Well I'm glad they did because they brought their fabulous sushi with them."}
{"text":"This place has become my Sunday night tradition for 'family dinner' with friends. The food is fresh, delicious, and BIG (portions). It is run by a very sweet couple...2 people do it all! Service is always great. The menu is extensive and I've never had something I didn't like. After eating sushi here for so long, it's hard to go back to other places!"}
{"text":"Great sushi burrito!  I tried Sushi Stop today based on previous Yelp raves and they were spot on!  A friend and I stopped here for lunch on a weekday and I ordered the Washington sushi burrito and my friend ordered a bowl that had rice at the bottom and tuna and avocado on top.  Both were about $12 after tax.  The burrito was huuuge and well worth it.  The rice was wrapped in a light and thin wrapper. I don't know what kind but it was a fluffy cloud of rice with salmon, avocado and imitation krab.  I was starving yet I could only finish 1/2 of the burrito.  Best value.  My friend also enjoyed her bowl and raved about the miso soup.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and quaint.  I will be back again to try the other items. Give this local restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"So delicious, everything they make!!! I love the tuna tacos and tostada!!! So much food and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Between two adult males, we devoured 5 rolls and it was almost too much. The rolls are large and AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place, and says he goes at least twice a month.  It is owned by a husband and wife.   She is the server and he is the sushi chef.   It's a small place, and as small as it is, there are always customers in here.

The first time I went for lunch I had the Combo B five-piece tuna, halibut, salmon, albacore and shrimp and eight-piece crunchy roll.   I liked the nigiri, but I didn't like the sauce nor the crunch on the roll.   The sauce seemed like some kind of bottled teriyaki sauce, and I didn't care for the crunch.

The second time I went, I had the five-piece nigiri again but I had the spicy tuna roll.   I liked this much, much better.

I like the friendliness of the owners.   They make a point of saying hi and bye and are very competent, friendly, and professional."}
{"text":"Sushi Stop is one of my favorite Japanese food places. I recommend everyone try it but suggest checking business hours beforehand and visiting on a weekday evening when it's slower. I had an awkward start to this restaurant: it took me 3 tries before I was actually able to sit down and eat. First time, the restaurant was probably at 75% capacity, but there was a long wait for food since there were two people working. Second time, I showed up on Tuesday, which is a day you're usually open, and there was a sign on the door saying they were closed. Finally, on the third try, I was successful. Ever since then, I have not had any issues, and they've reliably been open.

Usually I am turned off by multiple failed attempts at eating but curiosity motivates me enough to try until I succeed. In this case, curiosity was a good thing because I am obsessed with their food. They have some non-traditional items but overall, their creations have authentic components. For example, the rice in their sushi bowl is the sticky, vinegar rice that is usually used for sushi rolls. Other places usually use non-sticky, steamed white rice. Other food items they have include sushi rolls, entrees, desserts, etc. I've tried many of their food options and am particularly a fan of the sushi bowls due to the above reason and literally the PILE of fish they give you. Honestly, I don't care if I die from mercury poisoning. It is mouthwatering! They have mini entrees that run around $4-5. Seriously, the price is unbeatable. Their sushi rolls are also enormous, and I've been able to get full off one roll. Again, pricing for all the food is pretty fair. More money = larger portions.

The restaurant itself is pretty trendy and small. There's probably a total of 6-7 two-person tables there. It's spacious enough to feel as if you're at your own table, and not on top of your neighbor. Noise is manageable and varies depending on amount of customers. I think a couple owns this place, and they're usually there when I come. I have seen only the two of them there, which makes me believe that is the cause of the slow service during busier business hours. They're always so nice and accommodating. They always greet us when we come in and bid us farewell when we leave. Actually, the man always says, \"See you tomorrow!\" and about 30% of the time I am back the next day. They're usually pretty quick and apologetic when it's not. I've done take-out once and it was quick, but it was also on a slower night.

Come eat here if you're wanting some good Japanese food :)"}
{"text":"Of all the sushi places in the valley this is my favorite.  The portions are generous and the quality is second to none.  This couple takes the time necessary to do it right and they are still incredibly efficient.  You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer couple.  I love to banter with the owner in Japanese and he always asks about the family unless they are with me and then, if he's not busy, he'll make a point to come to the table and say hello to everyone.  I wish they were closer because I'd eat lunch here every day."}
{"text":"What a delightful find!  I am almost hesitant to write this review because I want to keep this gem all to myself so it doesn't get busy that I can't get in anymore.  The place is small but the sushi is so yummy!  And, the rolls are the biggest that I have ever seen so you definitely get your money's worth.  Since we found out about this place about a month ago, we have already been back three times now and I will probably end up there again this week.  Oh, and they have a \"sushi burrito\" - we didn't get it but I saw someone else have it and the thing is HUGE.  I hope this place is around a long time."}
{"text":"The girth of these rolls are something to be admired. I had to meet the man behind the monstrous rice log. The man the myth, the legend, Jay is the owner and chef. But don't try to fit his roll in your mouth all at once. It took me a couple of attempts before I got it all. 

I first thought I could handle two. I was SO wrong. Luckily the owner/server, May, talked me out of one of them. I'm so glad she did. I wouldn't have a place to put it.

May gave me so much attention and was so tender. With her husband Jay the two of them satisfied my every need.

I didn't know what to expect but this experience with May and Jay ignited a passion deep inside me. 

I'll be back for more and I'll be bringing friends."}
{"text":"So we gone to may sushi restaurants but they're just too expansive. So I asked Google if there was one that was cheap but good. And it send me to this place! Arriving there was pretty cute and small. But looking at the prices I was amazed.  heard many comments here that the rolls were huge!! Finally I found a inexpensive sushi mini restaurant, plus it's near my house:). And the service is great, very nice people. Thank you so much!  I love it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Rolls are huge, price is on point and the fish is the freshest I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Their sushi burritos are big enough to feed two normal sized people or one fat one. Seriously large and totally delicious.

I also really dig their rice. Not sure what it is but something about the consistency and texture of the rice is a cut above what you would expect.

Also, very friendly service. 

I just wished they delivered."}
{"text":"Saw this place today and decided to stop in for lunch. The menu has a huge selection to choose from which is really nice. I decided to try the edamame, shrimp tempura(3 pieces), 2 California rolls, and the Dobson roll. 

The edamame was very good and the shrimp tempura was delicious! As for the rolls..they had plenty of filling and were very tasty...my only suggestion would be for them to be made smaller:thinner...I feel the rolls were just \"too thick\" in a sense.

The customer service is very good and friendly...& the restaurant was clean:-)"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the valley! It had big portions in addition to creativity with the rolls and great service. I could not recommend this place more!"}
{"text":"The portions sizes are amazing especially for the price. I was not expecting to be full after 6 sushi rolls. lol I was hesitant to try a new sushi place but I am glad I checked sushi stop out! It is right down the street from me so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great stuff!!!! Had the sushi tostada loaded with crab and shrimp, super phily roll , all items huge!  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love Sushi Stop!! I'm never disappointed in not only the food but also the service! 
The rolls are huge and so fresh.  The tempura is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"HUGE rolls. Ask for easy rice. Nice mom and pop shop. Very friendly and kind. Have been back twice since we decided to first try it out. We've gotten a little smarter after our first visit and ordering our \"usual\"amount of food but still haven't left feeling gorged from trying to clear our table :)"}
{"text":"Update: brought the kids tried tonkatsu ramen.  Noodles very good, meat tender melts in your mouth, the broth must be bone based, it is rich and flavorful. Got takeout ramen another time and Mei asked what time we would be arriving for pick-up. Jay left broth on stove and waited TIL I arrived to put into ramen container. Why? So I wouldn't have soggy noodles! Talk about care and quality of food served! Can't say enough about the owners and restaurant. Will be back again and again. Like Jay says everytime we go and after paying the check: \"See you tomorrow!\"  :)"}
{"text":"You can really taste the freshness in the fish. Much better than 90% of the other sushi places around.  Plus, the rolls are enormous! Normally I can each 3 or 4 myself but I couldn't finish the two I ordered. Sushi Stop is a must try for sushi lovers, you will not be disappointed and it'll probably become your new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh goodness I just love little mom-and-pop shops like Sushi Stop! The owners are an absolute delight. A very cute and nice couple named Mei and Jay. Great customer service and very friendly :) 

Ryan had seen this place a while back with a sign that said they served Tonkatsu Ramen so that's what we were going to try. But unfortunately, they no longer serve ramen! No worries because the rest of their menu is spectacular! 

We had one of their daily specials: salmon belly sushi $5.95 for two pieces (devoured before i could remember to take pictures) and their edamame appetizer. 

Ryan ordered their sushi combo B which was 5 pieces of assorted sushi with a California Roll. I was thinking about getting that, but expected their california roll to be the typical tiny 8-piece rolls you get with other standard Japanese restaurants. Well when it came my eyes popped out!! Their california roll was GIGANITIC! Topped with panko crunchies and eel roll. Absolutely perfect.

I ordered their Fire Crunchy Roll, which had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, crab, avocado, eel sauce and rice. It was like a neverending bowl. I swear after eating for like 10minutes i barely made a dent in the bowl. 

We ended up packing a bunch of our leftovers home and it was a wonderful treat for later that night. We had a great meal and we will definitely be back for some regular takeout!!"}
{"text":"OMG, HUGE portions, GREAT taste, affordable, and friendly people. What more can you ask? I had their Katsu curry and pork katsu was perfectly fried. Juicy inside and crunchy outside. Curry was amazing as well. And they put fukujinzuke (pickled radish) on the side? Now that's authentic Japanese food. The owner is very nice and passionate about their food. I would definitely  recommend this place."}
{"text":"The sushi here is some of the best that I have had. I was amazed on how inexpensive it is!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Los Angeles, CA and was visiting AZ and came to Sushi Stop. They had just opened a week prior.  This is an amazing sushi place!!! 

Food: great quality. The sushi is FRESH FRESH FRESH--- you wouldn't believe the price for the quality. Sushi: We tried the J roll, Mesa roll, Washington roll, and the Mexican roll. OMG all the rolls were so beautifully plated and sooooooo DE-DE LICIOUS!!!!!!!  Hot foods: we tried the curry and chicken beef teriyaki AMAZING!!!! You can't go wrong with anything you order here. 

All their sauces are made from scratch: Jay makes the  teriyaki, salad dressing, ponzu, and eel sauce.

The staff: Jay and Mei, the owners are sooo sweet and welcoming. The ambiance here is so warm and comfortable the decor is modern. Jay is \"the\" Sushi Chef and is quite the character, very funny guy. He used to work for Iron Chef Morimoto. That's impressive!!!

Keep up the great food & service Sushi Stop!!!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this new sushi restaurant after reading the good reviews. We showed up tonight at 7:29 and got turned away because they were closed... Hours say they close at 8:00pm so we were a little disappointed. Super bummed.

Just came for a second time.. Monday evening at 6:40. CLOSED. The to go menu and yelp have different hours then what is posted in the window. The window hours say that they are closed on Monday evenings. Sigh."}
{"text":"My fave new sushi place! Nice staff, clean, fast, reasonable, fresh, and good sized portions of sushi. And they have real Ramen!! I have been looking for good ramen since leaving san diego. Hopefully in time they will offer more types. So GOOD! We also ordered the eel roll and salmon roll, the chef made it with HUGE portions of salmon and even threw in the leftover pieces of salmon. He hooked me up on the masago, too. mmmmm :D And, although they dont have boba, I hear they may start getting milk tea (in the bottles). 

They already have regulars, too. It's a quiet strip mall, so I hope they do well and stay! Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls! We got the rainbow roll and the dobson tempura roll. Both were fresh and big. Our friends ordered tuna and salmon rolls which were great, too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. It is a small family run sushi place, with a nice atmosphere and good service. The menu is probably my favorite sushi menu I've ever seen, it has a great modern sushi vibe with things like sushi burritos, sushi bowls, but the best of the classics like spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. The prices are awesome and the ROLLS ARE HUGE, not like \"oh my god how am I going to eat this, this ruins the whole thing\" but more like \"oh my god I am in love with this place, I can't stop eating these\". The rolls are beautiful and perfectly proportioned, for a total sushi snob I was in absolute heaven. Give these small guys a chance, you will not be discounted I promise."}
{"text":"I came in, and it seemed like a cute mom and pop shop. I ordered the Philly Roll, which was delicious, and I saw a sign for Ramen. I wanted to order that, but Mei said they didn't sell it anymore. I was disappointed, and asked why. She told me it took a very long time to make, so I can see that. The prices were amazing, the owners were nice, and  the food was amazing. And here's a tip to the owners: Please bring the ramen back. It doesn't matter if it takes long. You'll have a better business. I definitely will come back for the delicious, fresh food and the amazing owners :)"}
{"text":"We just got take out!  So tasty was the dynamite roll!  And even the avocado roll had such generous pieces of avocados!  My daughter gave her two thumbs up!  We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Great food! The portions are huge. Also, my boyfriend is allergic to gluten and the didn't have any Tamari so the chef made him a special sauce! Pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Huge rolls for a great price. Can't wait till I come back again!!!!!! Everyone needs to try this small home feel sushi house."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant! Taking up the space where Foodies Haven used to be, they spruced up the place and made it into a nice cozy spot to enjoy some Japanese cuisine. They have a pretty good variety of food to choose from, such as curry, sushi, rice bowls, udon and tempura for all your casual dining needs.

We had the jalapeno bomb ($3.95) to start with and I had the sashimi plate. The jalapeno was excellent. It was stuffed with spicy tuna and drizzled with sauce. It was a wonderful combination of spicy, sweet and savory. 

For my main course I had the sashimi plate ($9.95). The plate was a generous portion of salad, rice, and sashimi. I had 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon and albacore. It was perched on a bed of shredded radish, seaweed salad, with ginger and wasabi on the side. I enjoyed the dish and all its components. The salad was dressed with what tasted like a house made ginger sauce. The cool crispness went well with the warm rice and raw sashimi.

Service was very friendly and we were checked up on as needed.

I spied a neighbor's plate to see that the katsu curries were huge! I'll have to get that next time I want to eat a mountain of food.

Overall, for the amount of food you get for your money, the freshness of the ingredients, and the lovely couple running this mom and pop restaurant, you can't go wrong here! For these reasonable prices don't expect Jiro quality sushi fish, but the service, portions and affordable price can't be beat!

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are larger than other spots. Prices are low. Came here last week and today we are back."}
{"text":"We had eel roll, spicy tuna, Dobson roll, shrimp shumai, and the miso soup. Everything was spectacular.  Rarely do I say that.  Shumai and Dobson rolls were standouts but both traditional eel/spicy tuna we're excellent.   Very fresh fish.  Impeccably clean restaurant area.   Nice people. Fast service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi, fresh and good portions...BEST beef curry and good prices. Service is great and cute little shop."}
{"text":"Wow! Beautiful presentation and so tasty! This may become my favorite sushi place! I had the Washington bowel for my first visit. I'll have to try many other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We  were in the area and based on other reviews came in
 .AWESOME!! Lobster dynamite roll, shrimp egg roll,  J-roll. All so tasty and fresh.  A small but sweet spot.   Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  If you like sushi at a nice price this is the place to go.  My fiance would highly recommend the sushi burritos and the chicken katsu curry is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem in Mesa is a place you need to try. If you like sushi you will LOVE Sushi Stop.  Nessled in next door to Goodwill store only makes it cozy and intimate. The food is fresh and is created by the owner Jay. Pricing is average but the the portions are larger then most which makes it stand out. Please give them a try and I bet this will be your goto spot for SUSHI!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff is super friendly ( even offered to put a kids channel on for my kids to watch) The udon was wonderful. The broth was so on point. The sushi was insanely fresh and so well prepared. They even double cut my sons California roll so it would be easier for him to eat, which was super thoughtful. The show stopper of the meal though was their sushi tostado. I know, it sounds weird at first but it was fusion heaven! Seriously the one of the best things I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good sushi this is a great place to eat. The food I had was amazing. I ordered the udon soup and a eel roll. The food portion is fairly big so you get a lot for what you pay. Definitely planning on coming back again."}
{"text":"I rarely review on yelp, but came by Sushi Stop today to check it out and had the tempura entrée. It was amazing, so good I ordered one to go! Not only was the food great, so was the customer service, everyone is very friendly. They also did a great job remodeling the location. Also very clean!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's a small locally owned restaurant in s strip mall. The specialty rolls are like nothing I've had before. One roll is enough for a meal and the quality is amazing. The staff are super friendly and remember us every time we come. We now come at least once a week.

Seriously, give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"The portion is huge, and also the size of the rolls are so big. This place looked like a family owned place. I'm definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little mom and pop place. I've ordered here myself twice and both times the service has been quick and the little lady taking orders is so adorable and polite. I've eaten the food quite often though (coworkers usually get takeout bring it back next door to work) and every time the sushi does NOT disappoint. Everything is fresh, delicious, and so reasonably priced for the massive 8 pieces you get in a roll. I love this place and would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I came in wondering what to expect. The pictures made the entrees look small so we way over ordered. Which was ok because we got to take the rest of the deliciousnes home. Tbe udon was amazing, the chicken katsu curry was enourmous and delicious. The sushi rolls are large and very well priced. Overall i had a great experience here. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"It still seems like they have a few kinks to work out, but for the price, the food was amazing. Order the Rainbow Bowl. My entire family was literally fighting over it after we all tasted it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I've had in the valley. The spicy tuna is to die for. The rolls are huge, and priced great!"}
{"text":"This is a new cute little place located next to Goodwill. I walked in to place a to-go order. The workers were really friendly and informative. My food was ready in about 20 minutes. The sushi rolls were large and filling. The salmon on top of my Washington roll was so fresh! The California roll had shredded crab inside, I prefer it shredded over whole pieces. 

The only thing that would make this place better would be saki bombs and boba tea."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Oishi tabemono.  The owners are sooooo nice and they serve their food with love you can literally taste it."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have ever had! Good customer service and the price is way more than fare. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"this place is a hidden gem!!! great sush huge servings great staff!!!  the crab and shrimp egg roll is a must have!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Japanese comfort foods like curry rice and dishes that delight, look no further than Sushi Stop. My family and I have eaten here twice and the owners are charming and kind and remembered us from our first visit. The portions are generous and the flavors are on point. And if you're looking for seasonal foods, their specials will surely delight you."}
{"text":"Our never ending search for delicious chicken katsu curry has ended. The portion was large enough for two people to share and just delicious Japanese comfort food. Clean area and very good service. We also enjoyed a Jalapeño Bomb which will be a must have any time we return. And return we shall! This is my new favorite spot and I can't wait to try more food!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, but the place is really small and the service is slow and leaves much to be desired. I went her for my birthday dinner and was really happy with the freshness and portion sizes, but it took a long time to get seated, the decor is no frills, and the waitress was just meh. 

Come for the food and nothing else."}
{"text":"The other reviews are true. I was super impressed with this place. The sushi burritos are huge! I tried the Mexican sushi burrito and it was really good. The staff was also super nice and quick. I'll definitely be back. Also, just FYI the place is pretty small so I wouldn't go with a huge party. You can also get orders to go."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! It is kind of a Mexican sushi fusion and I have literally loved ever meal I've ever eaten here."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going here - DO IT! In a landlocked state it may not seem possible, but their sushi is so fresh and delicious! The tuna taco appetizer is a must, and you really can't go wrong with anything else you may order. On top of the food being great, the service is top notch. It's a husband/wife team and they are SO kind and grateful to everyone who comes in. They remember us every time we visit! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! If you want fresh sushi and ready to splurge, this is the place to go. First thing the place, it has that rustic japanese sushi place feeling the moment you enter the door. The sushi serving is Big and the roll are HUGE! Quality wise it is great (the size overkills it.) This is my 4th straight day eating in this place and counting. The Sushi place is run by a couple, the hubby (i assume) is the chef, and the wife (i assume) is the waitress. You could definitely tell they serve their food with pride and passion. A must place to visit when you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is small but very cute, and the food is very great. Good prices for the large udon bowls. Great service. Run by a husband and wife. This place is a hidden gem. Try the jalapeño bombers."}
{"text":"The rolls are delish and HUGE! Seriously, one roll is a meal of its own. My kids had a great time, very friendly and accommodating staff. Its a cute little place, clean, comfortable atmosphere. I left completely satisfied and more then full. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is going to be a relatively short review as I've only eaten food from here once. I ordered lunch from Sushi Stop with a co-worker on Friday. She actually suggested the place and after looking at the menu on Yelp and reading some reviews, especially Joyce W's review, I settled on ordering the Washington Bowl. I placed the order over the phone and was given about a fifteen minute pick up time. It's a huge portion of food for less than $10. It's salmon, crab, cucumber, and avocado over sushi rice. It tasted so fresh and the rice was great, the perfect amount of flavor. I'm not a fan of ginger so I didn't eat it but that wasabi was some of the freshest wasabi I've had in Arizona and this meal was hands down, the best sushi I've tried in Arizona thus far. I was pleasantly surprised and am really looking forward to ordering from here again. Next time I order from here I'll definitely try one of their burrito rolls or another roll."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite sushi spot! Everything about this place is amazing. Friendly service. Incredibly low prices. Huge portions. And delicious sushi! I've never had a bad experience and always look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi places that I have been to! Very good size roll for the price. Had the Dobson roll is highly recommended. Service was fast and courteous. A pitcher of water accompanies your water glasses so you can refill at your leisure. Please stop by and try this shopping plaza hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Overall just okay. I'm not sure why other reviewers gave such high ratings. Too much imitation crab in all of the dishes with limited amounts of other seafood. Many other sushi restaurants in the area with similar prices but better quality."}
{"text":"June 18 might be International Sushi Day but for me, every day is International Sushi Day.  

I've been seeing their \"Sushi Stop\" sign every time I drive by the intersection for a while.  To be honest, I thought it meant that the gas station in that corner had sketchy sushi for sale but as it turns out, they had an actual store. They're right by Buono's!

I don't believe this Sushi Stop is affiliated with the ones in California so if you've been to those locations, they won't have the same menu items.  This place serves fun items like tostadas with your standard sushi ingredients, entrées like tempura and teriyaki, curry, udon, rolls, sashimi, sushi bowls, and dessert.  Here's what I've had to try so far:

Washington Bowl - Salmon, crab, cucumber, avocado over rice [$9.95] :
At first glance, it was everything you expect from something under \"sushi bowl.\"  It was deconstructed sushi with a bed of sushi rice, a layer of imitation crab, a fan of avocado slices, a bundle of cucumber sticks, a small heap of ginger, and some really fresh salmon [it still smelled like cantaloupe!].  As soon as I dug in, I was surprised to see my chopsticks sticking.  The rice is actually legit sushi rice!  Most people wouldn't get what the heck I'm talking about since most people are use to the plain rice with barely to no vinegar in it but the sumeshi here is legit.  There was a perfect amount of vinegar and slightly sweet to the taste.  I didn't realize a vanilla bowl of deconstructed sushi could get me excited.

Tonkotsu Miso Ramen [$8.95]:  
Not a bad ramen but not the best.  The broth was very clean and delicate and lack the sticky-feel on the lips from collagen released from a true bone broth.  Perhaps these bones were only boiled for a few hours.  The lack of fat swimming on the surface is a good indicator of what's to come.  The egg is also a plain boiled egg and not one that's been slowly simmered in any sauce.  It's still a decent bowl of ramen but I probably won't be ordering it again. Two slices of chashu, seaweed, onions, and a slice of narutomaki completes the modest bowl of ramen.

Dragon Burrito Roll - Eels, crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce [$13.95]:  
This hefty boy can easily be split between two people and that's what I did.  Unlike sushi burrito joints where you can choose what kind of wrapper you want [nori, soy paper, tortilla, etc], these only come on soy paper.  You also can't choose your filling which is a pity.  This is a decent sushi burrito but it needs some texture.  Perhaps some tempura bits would be good.  I don't know if you can ask for it but they did have a crunchy burrito as an option.

The owners are a sweet couple. The sushi chef has a very impressive resume, even working for Iron Chef Morimoto!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you have not experienced the latest craze that is the Sushi Burrito, you must try one at Sushi Stop. Their Sushi Burritos are nearly the size of a newborn, and will keep you craving more. Small and friendly atmosphere, and I highly recommend you give them a shot. Bring an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Excellent! Huge sushi burritos at a great price. Scallops were amazing! Will be my new go to stop for sushi... a sushi stop."}
{"text":"My favorite roll and sashimi chef is right here at Sushi Stop!   If you like extra large rolls with custom ingredients and super fresh then this is your place .  Fair warning though... be patient .  The husband and wife team own the place and run the show solo ....so be patient on the service.   They need to offer filtered water as the free water is yuk. 
The wait is worth it though for the excellent Asian fare
Check it out on the off hours for faster service.  5 star taste and  good prices."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. The food, portions and people are all great. Their curry has chunks of beef in that are a pleasant surprise. The rolls are pretty fat, and the daily specials mean there is always something new to try."}
{"text":"We just went here for lunch and I had to much sure I wrote them a glowing review! They are a pretty new restaurant, it is cute and cozy with friendly staff. We had the Beef Teriyaki and the Udon + Spicy Tuna Roll combo. Everything was fresh and the portions were above-average. Prices are definitely fair for what you get. I honestly liked the roll so much, I'm still thinking about it several hours later. I can't wait to go back. 

Welcome to Mesa!"}
