{"text":"Reading these reviews about service, food and drink prices is actually comical.  I went here for the first time on a Monday night, and it was pretty legit...for 5 dollar meals that are decently portioned, I think its just down right silly to complain about how long it takes for food to come out, blah blah blah.   Service - Ya our service started off a bit slow and we did have to flag our waitress down on a couple occasions, which i personally hate doing (being a server/bartender myself) -- but once we started drinking more and she probably realized that we weren't cheap students or groups of people who drink water, she warmed up to us (and we got free shots on a shotski--completely out of nowhere but much appreciated). I can't help but sympathize with the servers here and can't imagine how much bullshit they put up with, especially when the food is so cheap. So we tipped her well, and our bill for 4 people was around $150, which may be a rarity there on a Monday.  People on here who have complained about not getting your water on time, or that you felt shafted --unfortunately when you work in an area dominated by students, you develop certain biases and come to expect a 2 dollar tip on 20, etc. So perhaps if you go against the stereotype, and tip more than 10%, you might get better service next time? I'm a student that goes to U of T too so I'm not bashing -- just that we are known for being cheap and demanding.  Also, anyone complaining about expensive drinks are definitely, definitely not considering the fact that a) they're not and b) how do you imagine in your narrow minded vision that the owners make profit? Cmon now, smarten up.  Any one who complains about this place needs to think about the bigger picture and stop being so goddamn selfish -- for 5 dollars a meal, I would treat the service staff with respect and TIP WELL --words to live by my fellow cheap ass students."}
{"text":"Spent the day walking around the Annex and stumbled upon this place. Their awning said \"everything is $4.95\" and it caught my attention. So glad I went inside.  We were seated right away and service was quick and friendly the entire time. I was surprised by the large variety of meal choices offered on the menu. I was expecting it to be very limited, given the price advertised outside. I was wrong. I was also expecting the portion sizes to be small. I was wrong there too. The bowls of pasta looked huge, the salads very filling, and the apps the perfect size.  My boyfriend and I both had their Works Burger with fries. It came with bacon on a brioche bun, and it was juicy and flavourful. The fries were seasoned with spices (I don't know what they were) and also very tasty. I had a coke and my bf had a coffee. Including tax, our bill totaled  $17.00 and change and we left there full and satisfied.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"*ATTENTIONS**  First let me ask \"WHAT CAN U GET WITH $ 4.95 In Toronto?\" one large espresso from Starbucks? But u probably need more than one cup to make yourself high enough for work! Two TTC tickets? F*** them, they always let u wait forever! Maybe two cheese burger from McDonalds? Oh no, please, they just taste like freezer...... People, please just stop! let me tell you, with $4.95, you ain't get a shit here! u even cannot get in a cab! u even cannot get into Dance Cave without your student ID! But now, there's place called El Furniture Warehouse is coming to your city, and your guys are damn lucky, because they sell all the food for $4.95! and they are f*** delicious!!!!! not just \"ok food\", I mean \" F*** Delicious!!!! If u don't know what \"delicious\" means, please don't comment or write review here! whatever you're vegan or a meat lover, you all can find your dish here, because they have tons of options on the food menu for your all. At this point, have to mention the burger there, swiss mushroom, veggie are the kill!!!! juicy and tasty! u even don't need dip source for fries, because when u eat your juicy burger, all the juice from the burger will dump onto fries, and please make sure u get extra napkin before you eat them, anyway, I can guarantee they will be best $5 burgers in your life! also the place get wicked in the night! great choice of music, no radio stations or top 50, DJ comes every night to turn the place on! Nice environment, nice people and amazing food with great value. So Torontonian, what are u still waiting for? The legend is happening now, don't you want to be part of it?"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is $4.99! And considering the low price, the food is actually amazing. Mac n' cheese, burgers, salads, sandwiches and more, in large portions. The atmosphere is fantastic with great music, great service and not to mention delicious drinks. I love this place."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is a 2 of 5 (or a 4 of 10 ;). To break it down, the price of the food alone would allow this establishment to be a 9.6 out of 10 (or a 4.8 out of 5) strictly based on the fact that a meal costs as much as half a pack of darts (amiright?).   Where El Furni falls short is in the ambiance, the clientele, and  the price of drinks. This Alt-Bro HQ has a Whistler feel (not necessarily a good thing). I was going to rant about the staff, but they're all flames."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've experienced in the city. First time I was there in mid-October, i witnessed a bartender over-serve a group of young female university students, also making a derogatory and sexist comment when another patron pointed out that the students appeared heavily intoxicated (later, the group stumbled out of the bar, barely able to walk). The other patron said they would call the next day to complain, the result of which I am unaware. More recently, in temperatures of -30 with windchill, myself and two others (note that there were only three of us in the line-up) were prevented from waiting for a free table indoors rather than out in the cold (even though, interestingly, there were several tables visibly free inside). The staff member's response was arrogant at best, and completely void of human decency (and respect for human rights?) at worst."}
{"text":"It's always a fun place to go. They have a line up down the block most nights of the week.  Food is great for the price but it's the drinks where they get you. Always great tunes and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for 9 days and of those 9 I came here 3 times. I have to say I loved the food and the prices. The staff is also great too.   First day in Toronto I had the tacos and potato skin appy. They were not the world's greatest tacos but they were really good. They were filling, tasted well and the price I could not argue with.  Second visit, I had the Mac and Cheese, It was sooo amazing! Hands down some of the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. I loved that it was just a touch spicy too.  Last visit, had the beef dip.... okay being from Alberta I'm super picky about beef dip... knocked this out of the park! Hands down my fav dish there. Would totally go back during my next visit and have already told my friends travelling that way to give it a try too."}
{"text":"Cheap food.  Great drinks. Amazing atmosphere.  Recipe for success.  I feel like every time I'm here, I've got a story to leave with.  The staff is tremendous.  Also - ski shots"}
{"text":"Hate to be this person but the experience I had at the Queen W location last night was abhorrent. Can I do less than one star? Worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I had a small group of 3, including myself, really, REALLY looking forward to trying this place out. We were dying to. We planned the whole week around it. Worst service ever and we didn't even get inside the damn place.  Last night, in Toronto's decently bad snow storm, we walked in and asked for a table for three. There was a wait. No big deal. Could we sit at the bar? No, the server couldn't \"move us around all night.\" So I said, hey, those three girls that just left the bar for a table moved, maybe we could sit there until a table is ready? No, she can't move us. I kindly replied, but those girls were at the bar until their table was ready, so could we? Server walked away from me and ignored me when I asked that.  Another hostess came by and asked for how many. No tables, can't sit at the bar. Also can't wait inside. \"In this snowstorm?!\" was my boyfriend's response. Sorry, that's the case. So we waited. In the cold snowstorm. On Queen St. For half an hour. Because we wanted to try this place.  So we waited for half an hour. Soaking wet and cold. So we watched tables clear and thought finally, we'll get to go inside. Except that two tables of 4 and 5 respectively were seated AS SOON as they walked in the restaurant. So I'm thinking now that filling one extra seat was more important to this place than happy customers or even getting customers. So we waited for half an hour in a snowstorm and were treated like trash on the curb. And two tables were seated before us. We asked the servers why they were seated before us and they said, \"a table should clear up soon!\" For real?   The worst experience I've ever had. Will never come here and will make sure to tell people about how terribly we were treated."}
{"text":"Ok this is got to be the best food for that price and for that alone they deserve a 4 star! The food is great...we've tried the beet and goat cheese salad, the works burger, the pulled pork, the poutine and chicken wings in the many times we've been there. In my opinion portion sizes have decreased somewhat, but it still is more than enough and still a good bang for your buck. Service is great for a pub, I have even returned a dish once and they apologized and brought out a better one. However, I'm beginning to visit this place a little less now because of the music. I used to love it (when the music was more classic rock, pop rock) but more recently they only have rap/R&B songs that are played so loud you might as well have gone there alone. Drinks are comparatively expensive especially their \"specials\" but who can complain once you've had ski shots."}
{"text":"This review was from when they first opened.  Apparently it ended up in the wrong location on yelp so I was told to repost it in the proper spot.  Hopefully things have improved since then but here is my original review:   I don't usually write these things but this place has so much potential and yet failed with the service, so I feel like constructive criticism needs to be given. My mom and brother were visiting so we decided to take them to El Furniture Warehouse for lunch. We got there around 1pm and the place was about half full. We were seated immediately and served by a waitress who was very nice and friendly.   We ordered cokes to start and they came promptly but were watered down. When I say watered down I'm not being picky or exaggerating, I mean it was literally a glass of water with maybe a half shot of coke dumped in. It looked like slightly dirty water and you couldn't even taste the coke. I can't stress enough just how ridiculous it was.   Then we ordered our food. There were four of us and we ordered 6 dishes. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. It was about an hour before we got any food. My mac and cheese, my moms quesadillas and the potato skins the two of us were sharing showed up. We were starving by this point so we started eating while the other two were waiting. (As a side note, the girl who actually brought the food who wasn't our server gave us the quesadillas and pronounced it phonetically...(kaysadillas) Not a big deal but make sure your servers know how to pronounce something like quesadilla or it looks really strange.  Then our server came back to check in and saw that half of us didn't have food and asked us again what they ordered. She ran off to check the status. When she came back she told us there had been a mistake and those dishes had never been entered into the kitchen so they had to make them from scratch. (When the order was taken it was all written down on the same piece of paper so I'm not sure how two of us got our food entered and two didn't but that's a major problem that needs to be addressed)  We're patient people but we already thought it was ridiculous to have been waiting an hour and now having to wait longer while they watched us eat was over the top. This is where somebody needed to grab some chips and salsa (or something else that doesn't require cooking time) and give it to them so that they have something to snack on while waiting again.   Their food came after we had finished ours. Our waitress was very sweet and very apologetic and we didn't give her a hard time. She was very nice and apologized profusely which actually went a long way. However, we still thought it wasn't right so when it was time for the bill we asked if the three $3 cokes could be comped to make up for the wait. She agreed and then went to get the bill. A while later she came back saying she was trying to find the manager because he had to do it and that it would be a little while longer. Then she returned with the bill and the $9 of dirty water was comped which was great.  Overall they have a great space, delicious food, prices that can't be beat, friendly servers, but if the service remains the same as what we experienced people won't go back.   Our suggestions are, check in with the table when they're waiting an hour for their food. Give people some free snacks if the restaurant has messed up their order and is making them wait beyond the hour that the rest of their table waited. You can water down the cokes a bit but that was beyond anything i've ever seen and they cost $3. Even just give a can of coke for $3 and you're still making a ton of money off them. Allow your servers a bit of leeway to be able to comp $9 worth of coke for a horrible experience. Having to wait for her to find the manager after having waited so long for our food was the cherry on top.   Because it's so cheap and so delicious we'll probably give them one more chance, but if we receive a similar experience that will be it. I'm hoping we just experienced some opening week kinks, but those are some pretty big kinks that need to be addressed ASAP if they want to remain successful."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe 3.5 but based on the service and prices, not the food. It's true, all food items are $4.95 and the portions are reasonable, not huge. We ordered a beet and goat cheese salad that had way too much dressing, the mac&cheese which was fine and the mushroom/Swiss burger which was a typical frozen patty and my fries were cold and stale. Anywhere else, it would have gone back but at $4.95, I guess you get what you pay for.   Our server was nice and efficient, we didn't have to wait at all for a table and the food and beer came quickly. Music was quite loud but we enjoyed the selection of old-school (complete with videos). I'd probably try again but order something different next time."}
{"text":"I went to this place in a middle of a snow storm. My best friend and I felt like we were at a ski lodge. Nice and cozy atmosphere.  I ordered the pull chicken sandwich with soup. The soup tasted like pasta sauce so sent it back and asked for a kale salad instead. I almost chipped my tooth while eating my salad to find a plastic cap in my mouth.   Though the waitress apologized, my meal was not compensated, nor discounted.  Its a casual place after all, she was wearing a toque."}
{"text":"You honestly get what you pay for. I got a veggie burger because our waitress said it was good. When I got it it didn't look bad, but when I ate it it felt like something I'd make at home in 3 minutes (yet it took like, a half hour).. they used kraft singles processed cheese, and there was also a hair dangling out of my burger. My sister got onion rings, her mouth was glistening in the dim lighting of oil. The space was also really tight and we were back to back with strangers. But honestly, you get what you pay for. But I thought it was pretty gross. If theres a line, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Okay so I really wanted to give this place a 5 star but can't because a server was absolutely rude to me and my family! So basically this dude who had the section by the door told us that we can't sit in his section unless we ordered from him...we got in there and sat by the bar and ordered our food. We spotted a seat and then some more seats and asked the kind bar tender who took our order if we can sit there. He said yes if it's free!   So we moved and the rude server who's responsible for the seats by the door gave us menus. I told him that we already ordered and paid for the food, since the bar tender told us to pay before moving. He rudely responded with, \"well you can't sit here unless you buy from me\"! He asked us to move back to the bar where we ordered. We said sorry but the bar tender said we can move wherever there's a free table.   I couldn't believe how rude this server was and didn't understand why he would behave in such a way. Yes I get it we moved seats but only because we were given permission to. Or else we wouldn't have moved! This guy was unbelievable. Can you imagine, you can't sit here unless you order from me, this is my section! Like dude it's an establishment our orders go back to the house not your pocket so what's the problem!!   We also waited about an hour and a half for our food! It was good and my son loved his veggie burger!  Shame on him and I hope there's an actual manager who pays attention to this the next time he pulls such a stunt on customers! We did like the bar tender who took our order so he's the reason why we are giving this place a 1"}
{"text":"Trotted in there on a sunny Friday afternoon and was sat by the open-air window almost immediately. The atmosphere IS laid back but if you're commenting on the 'decor' of a bar that serves a cheaper veggie burger than Burger King - you have issues.   The best part? The burger is ten times better than anything you will find in a fast food joint - quality ingredients such as avocado on a brioche bun. The Mac N Cheese is massive and delicious. The quinoa apple salad is a large enough portion and the burgers are even served with a kale Caesar salad."}
{"text":"I honestly went into this pub with low expectations due to how inexpensive the food is (4.95 for everything) i ordered the works burger and the poutine. I have had my fair share of burgers and this one was juicy and tasted like it was made of fresh ground beef vs frozen. The poutine was pretty good as well! My friend ordered the mac and cheese and i really enjoyed that also. I personally think its a great place to go to for a casual lunch or dinner. It is quite loud and dark in there but i did not find that to be an issue for myself! The selection of music that was played was also really good :)"}
{"text":"First thing to start off - excellent pricing! $4.95 for all items - where else could you find that?! Nevertheless, you're paying for what you're getting, so don't come in here expecting exquisite cuisine. There is quite a wide range of food items so it caters to everyone. I came here on a weekday at around 2pm, so there wasn't too much of a crowd.  Service - I was alone and the hostess didn't seem too polite. It was the friendly bartender/manager(?) that took my order and made sure my glass wasn't ever empty. It was hard trying to get the waitresses' attention, since they all looked preoccupied. The wait for my single order took at least 15 minutes, which was a bit disappointing.  Food - again, don't expect the most gourmet food for $4.95. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and yam fries. The burger was nice and hot, and the brie bun was soft and great. I found the meat a bit too overseasoned and that there was a serious lack of veggies for my taste. Overall, still a good burger for $5. The yam fries were cut too thinly and didn't have the fluffy inside I was looking for. Also, the seasoning on the fries were bland and it was evident that the potatoes weren't that fresh because they weren't sweet at all.  Generally, a good place when you're running low on cash and just wants to grab a bite. The atmosphere is great if you have a few friends along and it was an overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The place is nice, the decoration in kind of skater/hipster. All the food menu is 4.95 and the size of portions is pretty decent. Usually it's very crowded so don't expect to arrive and get a table."}
{"text":"Fine. The foods cheap, cool. That's the only good thing about this place. My party of two spent 90$ last night. Enjoyed wine and some food. Left the waitress 15 bucks. Sure - it was now 2:20 am - but it's a pub and we were almost done our drinks when we were rudely cut off from some bitchy waitress ( she wore all black, black hat, black hair) when she yelled \"EVERYONE GET THE F**K OUT! THANK YOUR BARTENDERS AND LEAVE) followed by another waitress saying - your mom and dads are all waiting for you. Don't miss your bedtime. I'm sorry but this is not how you should speak to ANY of your customers regardless of time. I vow to never go back. If you hate your job and don't want to work nights then don't work here. Pretty easy solution.  Don't expect much here. Set your expectations low and maybe, just maybe, you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"This place could be amazing. I've been several times, and the food is always great and the drinks are creative and tasty. And with each item on the food menu being $4.95 all day every day, you certainly can't beat the price. My issues with this place are the atmosphere and with the service: beyond the way-cooler-than-thou décor (pretentious more than anything), the music is LOUD. Pounding bass and screaming techno to the point where you have to yell to be heard. I measured the average decibel level as 94 dB, which is equivalent noise level to that of a lawnmower - certainly more than is comfortable or safe for prolonged exposure. I asked the host if it would be possible to turn the music down slightly, and he scornfully replied that he would \"ask the DJ,\" but then never got back to us. The music stayed loud (including intermittent blasts of air horn sound effects) and my partner and I remained silent for the rest of the meal, not wanting to yell to each other across our small table. Now, the service: while the service on my previous visits has been lackluster but passable, this time I was disgusted by the degree of unprofessionalism and disregard for customer satisfaction that we experienced. After being shown to our table by the host, we waited over 20 minutes for anyone to even take our drink order. Finally, the bartender came over to ask if anyone had taken care of us. He took our food and drink orders, and delivered the drinks promptly. But the food (pierogies, pasta and a burger) took an additional 20 minutes to arrive, and came all at once. When I asked the server who delivered the food if we could please have knives, since none were at our table, she curtly said \"yep,\" disappeared and five minutes later put two steak knives at our table without another word. This whole time (now about 45 minutes since we arrived), there was a group of 4-6 employees in a corner booth beside the bar, yelling, dancing, and drinking. They cheered \"Best manager ever!\" while doing the running man, they pounded on their table and whooped along to the music, they high-fived each other and squealed while completely ignoring the customers. Not one person came to ask if our food was good or if we needed more water or another drink. It felt as if we had inadvertently walked into the staff party and were unwelcome annoyances. We ate as quickly as we could, flagged down the bartender to give us our bill (another several minutes), and left. No one thanked us for coming, no one apologized for the wait or updated us on why the music was at that volume. The group in the corner took no heed of our or other customers' incredulous looks, and carried on with their partying. Needless to say, we won't be returning. I'd rather pay $10 for a burger somewhere else than pay $5 to be ignored."}
{"text":"A unique name with an interesting business model. Since El Furniture Warehouse opened in Toronto about a year ago it has had a line up out the door and down Bloor every weekend. How are they doing it? Well anything on the menu is priced at 4.95$ at all times. That includes everything from a starter order of yam fries to a fully loaded burger with fries. Food cheaper then a five dollar hot and ready pizza will get people lined up, thats a no brainer. But El Furny isn't selling cardboard pizza in a cardboard box. The food is well above the standard for the price tag. I have had a couple of the burgers, the nachos, and various starter options and all were better then expected.  The place is dimly lit (even during the day) and plays an eclectic mix of hits at rather loud volume level. I have even been there when the have a DJ. The real question is how does this place money? Well the drinks are over priced which helps make up for low profit margin on the food. The Caesar is the lone stand out here. Honestly very tasty, but don't upgrade it to the \"Warehouse Caesar\" as there is really no difference.  The other thing that may or may not help in the budget is the staffing. I do not usually comment on the service as it is unlikely you would get the same server, host, or bartender that I got but El Furny is interesting. I have been four times now and every time it has been a completely new staff, never seen a single staff member there twice (Im pretty good at remembering faces). Unfortunately they were all quite bad; food was always slow to get out, mistakes made each time, and genuinely not that friendly. I do not know anyone that has worked here but I would be interested to hear their side of the story.  The Warehouse is that punk rock skate kid in your elementary school that some how got better grades then you. Theres more then meets the eye with this place."}
{"text":"Can';t go wrong with a 5$ menu. I went just after lunch time and ordered some wings and perogies. Both were deep fried excellence. At least they have a fry-guy who knows when to pull em. Don't remember much about the bar tab but it wasn't enough to make me think twice. Nice little spot in the Annex, i heard it's full of good looking girls and #lumbersexuals. As an older guy, i probably won't be able to account for those rumours, but I will definitely check it out again during the day for a budget-friendly lunch."}
{"text":"The food is not very good and the owners use their social media accounts for really aggressive personal insults to customers and random people. They took down their Instagram profile after a particularly offensive post about Bruce Jenner. It's really weird and completely irresponsible for a business owner. Oh, and they don't pull full pints. Avoid."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be crazy packed, but for $5 for a decent meal - worth the wait. Nice menu selection, and the burgers are pretty good. If only there were more locations here! Best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This place has the rudest people I HAVE EVER met in my life. I went in today with a small 2 month old baby. The hostess proceeded to start to tell me I could not stand inside and had to wait outside in the cold with my son. I had no issue waiting in line or my party waiting outside but NICELY asked if I myself could stand inside with the baby she continuously yelled at me that this was not possible and kept pushing my stroller and telling me to move! FINALLY I took his carseat off the stroller (closed the stroller and stood off to the side when she AGAIN was rude to me and told me you CANNOT BE HERE! I finally decided to leave and when we asked for the manager he told us theres nothing he could do and we could not stand inside!  DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR FROM ADULTS WHO SHOULD KNOW HOW TO TREAT OTHER INDIVIDUALS!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many poor reviews. Went here for dinner and after waiting in line for about 30 minutes, we finally got in.   My girlfriend and I ordered the perogies, poutine, and queso dip ($5 each!). We were hoping to order a dessert but we were absolutely stuffed from those three items.   The queso dip was incredible - never tasted anything like it. The poutine was pretty good (had bacon on it), and was a large portion. The perogies were probably the best I've ever had.   Good ambience - the staff were friendly and having fun. There was a DJ which was pretty cool.   Overall this was a great experience and we walked away full less than $10 each."}
{"text":"Prices are obviously great, and what you get for it is really awesome. Good portions. The service was a little slow but all around cool place to be."}
{"text":"Cheap food and drinks - Good service. Only downside is they do not take debit which is a bit of an inconvenience!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 3 stars but jeez, the service was terrible.  We arrived on a Friday afternoon and we knew the place was going to be busy so we didn't mind the wait to be seated (we waited about 10 minutes).   The good:  Food is extremely affordable and it doesn't taste bad. The nachos were surprisingly good or maybe I was just really hungry. Smokey BBQ burger was your average burger and I got a side salad (nothing special). Oh and the baja fish tacos were good with the sauce they give ya.   The bad: Maybe it was just our server but boy was she slow......we almost 30 minutes for our food and she kept messing up the order.  We ordered a couple drinks and didn't receive the right ones AND somehow were still charged for the drinks we didn't order?? We had to tell her that she made a mistake and she didn't even apologize but whatever.  Also, make sure you're not too bothered by loud music because I could barely hear my friends when they spoke. It was LOUD and really dark so be careful you don't trip anywhere.  Overall, I wouldn't go back. There's nothing special here and I wouldn't mind spending a few extra bucks for better service."}
{"text":"You have to laugh at all these reviews calling El Furniture Warehouse a hipster spot or calling it trendy.  This is bro central.  All the gym rat UofT kids go here.  The saving grace of the restaurant is the prices which are ridiculously low.  They know that and I feel like they only make money off the bar which is why the waitresses here are very eager to have you get a drink or add ons to your meal.  I would recommend going for lunch and not near the weekends because this can really turn into a gong show with drunken fratboys and bottle blondes going crazy all over the place.  if you can put up with the service and atmosphere I would not deny that El Furniture is a great bang for your buck but the experience isn't the best during peak times"}
{"text":"Since I had a wonderful experience at the restaurant located on Queen St. I figured this place would also provide exceptional food and customer service. People may have different experiences and opinions, but this is my experience and my impression/observation:  It was around 4:50pm on a Sunday late afternoon when we arrived at the restaurant. There was no line, good music was blasting, we were greeted nicely, and I we sat down in less than 20 seconds.  Atmosphere 5/5. Very hipster vibe. Atmosphere definitely aimed for mid 20s-30s crowd and it was quite interesting how the restaurant was built. Rails were made out of metal bars, the bar has eye catching lights, and alcohols were displayed nicely. The walls were filled with decorations that you can't help but to look at them over and over again. There were tv's set up for you to watch music videos as the DJ (very gorgeous if I may add) spun 90's music.  You can tell everyone was having a good time jamming to the music, many laughs were shared and overall other people were having a good time.   Food 4/5. What can I say, food was good. Prices were affordable. It was a decent size of food- whether It'd be an appetizer or an entree. It was great. Some food were too much sodium, too spicy. But overall, with the asking prize, it was satisfying.   Customer Service 2/5. It might've been me or the waiter was having a terrible night but this part of my experience was extremely poor. We waited for 20 minutes just for our waiter to come around  to get our food ordered. I ordered \"my-chy bowl\" (apologies for mispelled name)+ white russian,  my partner ordered nacho for one+ chicken wings+ guiness, and my friend ordered nacho for one + white russian. The bartender had immediately made our drinks (koodos!) And placed it on the left side of the bar for our waiter to grab our drinks. Our drinks had arrived 15-20 minutes later. Our food arrived 45 minutes later, however the waiter had brought two nachos for one and chicken wings. The waiter apologized for the incorrect order and had reassured me that my food (my-chy bowl) was coming shortly. I do understand that people make mistakes. As I have been in the food industry back in the days, I understand that incorrect orders are likely to happen. I was quite understanding and waited for my food to come.  When you're hungry- YOU'RE HUNGRY. You get antsy, you get HANGRY so to speak. My food arrived another 25 minutes later. The waiter had apologized and informed us that people at the back were backed up and there was high volume of food orders coming in. This is where I had a BIG ISSUE: 1) You don't blame the chefs. They didn't take the order. When the order comes in, they do it- plain and simple.  2) Accountability: is it hard to say, \"it was my mistake, I apologize\" - OWN the situation.  3) waiters eating: the whole entire time, i was watching my waiter. I watch him eat as he works. If you're going to nibble on something, don't do it where customers can see you. That's a bad habit.   As I have mentioned before, I have been in the food industry. I understand how tip is a reflection of your service. I did not appreciate how I still had to pay for a food that I waited for almost an hour and on top of it all, I had a very poor experience.  I would've still given a tip; however my partner was paying at that time. No tip. Not sorry."}
{"text":"Food was good, will get worse. Has all the makings of a Firkin pub: establish a client base, build chains, worsen. \"Hip decor\", \"cool staff\". Its a theme park restaurant. 5$ food doesn't justify 6.50 for a half pint. Music was way to loud, so we left to go somewhere to have a conversation. Not going back."}
{"text":"Finally my $5 savior of lunchtime and late night munchies on Granville St has made it's way east to Toronto.   There was a lineup out the door when I walked up at 730pm with my date. The place had just opened and had been profiled in BlogTO and other places. The wait for a table for 2 was about 30 min.   We finally sat down and the service was pretty attentive (to start). Being a warehouse veteran from my days in Vancity, I knew exactly what I wanted - mushroom Swiss and poutine. My date ordered the pulled chicken sandwich.   Our waitress warned us up front that there would be a 20 min wait for the food. I was cool with that seeing as how they were basically at capacity.   20 mins turned into 68 mins (after 60 mins I was counting). I was a bit shocked that there was that much of a delay without any real explanation as to why. I get that you're busy but waiting over an hour for food like a burger & fries? Hmmm... C'mon it's not like you're prepping filet mignon in the back there.   When the food finally did arrive, it was tasty to the standard of the original. The poutine had bacon in it (a nice twist for hogtown) but the cheese was actually a bit mushy and a bit lacking on the gravy. The mushroom Swiss was as I remembered it. Amazing! Both sandwiches were really good and the buns were fresh and soft.   I would come back and give it another shot but not sure if I would have the patience anymore to wait another hour for my meal. Anywhere.   (Full disclosure: I originally came to support a friend who works here & was feeling a little nostalgic about the warehouse in Van)"}
{"text":"Exceptionally long line up, but worth the wait.  Massive beet salad and a side of tacos. Both $5 a piece. Plus hooter shooters to wash it all down.  What a fun night!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place a few months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to go here for a quick and wallet-friendly dinner on a Friday night. We got there just before 5, and had no problems getting a table. We were seated near the bar, and our server came by immediately ready to take our drink order. The menu was relatively straight forward, but had a nice selection of apps, salads, and entrees, mainly consisting of sandwiches and/or pasta. Every meal item rang in at 4.95, as advertised, and the entrees came with a side of fries/salad/soup. We both ordered the chicken caesar kale wrap, as well as a separate order of poutine and a beet and goat cheese salad. Everything was fairly fresh, and we found no faults with our orders. The thing to note is that the portions are decently sized....1 order is enough for the average person. No clue how they manage to pull off that kind of pricing! I've already made the boyfriend promise that we can go back!"}
{"text":"Great value; great service...I've had the burger & fries, quesedillas, quinoa salad, poutine, mac and cheese--all good! can't go wrong w/ a menu where everything is under 5 bucks. Food can be hit or miss at times, but overall, would definitely recommend this place, mostly because of the price. Music can be a bit loud, & drinks are a bit pricey--but still great overall. Will definitely continue to go :)"}
{"text":"Great service, lovely decor and the prices are phenomenal. For the price food was very reasonably sized and my friend and I will definitely be back. We had the grilled cheese and pulled chicken with kale Caesar salad all of which were excellent."}
{"text":"We tried this place at the suggestion of a friend today after work.   Our waitress was welcoming and the food was o.k.  However, the owner Ian came up to our table and asked in a rather aggressive tone if we had been drinking water for two hours and needed our bill. My friend and I who had purchased several drinks and three plates of food were both shocked and dismayed at this type of treatment by an owner.   I can understand that they want to turn tables but nothing warranted this tone or interaction. I have never received such bad customer service. We paid our bill, tipped our kind but over worked waitress and advised the owner we would not be returning. Save yourself the trip."}
{"text":"I have only had the salad and it was good, the kale salad or beet, I forget.  The problem with this place, the music is way too loud.    The first time I went in I went with a large party and among them was a baby who complained bitterly about the volume and sighed a big sigh of relief when I took him outside.  I couldn't hear myself without yelling.  Ridiculous, do they think this is a nightclub?   I don't want to yell or be deafened by the music when I'm eating at a restaurant.  We couldn't stay bc of the volume and those that had already ordered food, took it to go.   I've been a couple of times since and although the music was at a considerably lower volume, I still had to raise my voice to be heard, as did the other patrons and the server.  It's clear they want to make an atmosphere for students, hence the 5 buck a meal deal and the loud music.  But don't fool yourself, the meal is only worth 5 bucks in size.  It's not like these are some huge portions that make suffering thru the music's volume  bearable.    It was never too busy when I've been there, average, I'd say.  So, maybe a better strategy would be to make it more relaxing  for EVERYONE by TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME!!"}
{"text":"Ashley was soooo awesome!!!!! She's the best :D  she made the experience that much better. Chuba was also awesome! The food and atmosphere was great. This was my second experience at El furny and I will definitely be back over and over again. If you haven't been I suggest you pay them a visit  this spot is one of my favs"}
{"text":"I live in the area and was incredibly excited to see the opening of El Furniture Warehouse. My first time going, I was pleased with the service and my food - I got the beet & goat cheese salad. The next time I went, I ordered the chicken tacos - they were absolutely tasteless. I found the service to be slower, but I was willing to forgive that.  Willing to give it another try, I went again this past weekend with a friend. The host at the front door was not all that friendly. He sat us with some other individuals at a table because it was busy (no problem, I don't mind meeting people!). It was about 9:15 and after a long day, we were only just ready for dinner. Not that I should have to justify whether or not I was ordering a drink, but after a long day in the sun, we just ordered food. Our server had attitude when we told her we didn't want a drink at that time. We waited approximately 30 minutes and watched everyone else around us get served. There was no acknowledgment of our waiting (for two salads).   My negative experience is not the only negative one that I have heard about EFW. Needless to say, I won't be back. Sad, because I am so close and it had a lot of potential."}
{"text":"We were waiting for half an hour outside the place and there was a plenty of empty tables inside but they wouldn't let us in, the hosts are pretty inattentive , place looks okay mixture on different types of music"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday, early in the evening, and my friends and I luckily got a table right away. The decor is fun in a rustic-cabin kind of way, there are some cool pieces around, and TVs playing really interesting videos of snowboarders. The seats are super comfy, and the tables are spacious.   I got the burger and fries. The fries were good (ie better than fast food, but not as good as fresh cut), but the burger was sort of bland. I'm pretty sure they're not freshly made, the texture and flavour was akin to the frozen varieties. My friends had the mac and cheese and the pulled chicken sandwich. The mac and cheese was very creamy and had a great spice kick to it, but it kind of reminded us all of liquid nacho cheese. The pulled chicken, however, was super flavourful and awesome. We also got the kale cesar to split, which was fantastic.  All in all, interesting menu, and generous portions. I'd come back for the pulled chicken and the kale cesar, and I'd definitely consider trying some more stuff from the menu. Warning though, the drinks are standard or above average pricing, so be wary of feeling like you're saving all that much money with the cheap eats if you're getting a few drinks with your meal."}
{"text":"Very bad service and the waitress forced a high tips for herself. No a place to chill.long wait on the food 30min or so. Food are cold when come to table with no forks and knives. But they very generous on salt over the food. Make sure you ask water but it might now come to your table."}
{"text":"I come often just for a drink and to meet a friend, it's central to both of us.   Food is sub par, the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  Service is best at the bar, pretty crappy everywhere else. Music is too loud, like WAY too loud.  For a bar, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to give this place another try seeing as we were in the area and wanted something cheap. Even though I don't recommend it. Still same thing happened, placed us in a tiny cubicle of a table even though we clearly don't fit comfortably. A bigger table was available so we moved there after asking the wait staff. Service was way slow and food came after 40 min. We were starving. My friend got cold wings but was so hungry he didn't send them back. I gave it 1 star in the past, still a 1."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere!!! Good music, fun crowd! The food is pretty good for the value but the last two times I was there the quality wasn't as good. But I will try it again."}
{"text":"The food at Warehouse is amazingly priced for the portion sizes. I have enjoyed every meal I've bought at Warehouse. The waitresses and bartenders are amazing and kind.   My only complaint is the price of drinks (soft drinks) are EXTREMELY over priced."}
{"text":"I went here a few times with friends. The $5 deal is ideal for students who are in a budget like myself, for a cheap price the portions are pretty filling. Customer service is good, though it gets really crowded so it's understandable that it isn't the fastest service.  The restaurant is very atmospheric, and loud. It's not the best joint to go if you want a quiet place to have lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with friends on a Tuesday. it wasn't crowded at all. we ordered the chori queso dip which big enough to share between three people. it was good it kind of tasted like movie theater nachos but better. I had a chicken quesadilla and Shirley temple. The quesadilla was really good considering it was only 4.95. there was lots of chicken, onions, and peppers with sour cream and salsa. it was definitely worth the money and I would go back. the staff was also really nice"}
{"text":"Bad service and worse food. The resto has a terrible social media presence that alienates it's potential clientele by being transphobic. Avoid."}
{"text":"Been coming to this spot for a couple years and never experienced less than their sub par service, though my last visit here was less than enjoyable. Although I was seated promptly, it took the waiting staff half an hour to realize I wasn't served or even offered a menu. Even after attempts of making eye contact with the staff and flagging them down. I was literally approached when they couldnt figure out why I was sitting there doing nothing. I received no apology and got a lot of attitude for the rest of my visit.   Two stars because the Baja tacos and mojito were great, everything else is questionable."}
{"text":"Cool place to go for a quick bite and drinks.  As advertised, food items are 5 bucks each and portion is worth the price.  I don't feel much for the food but freshly made donut is pretty decent.  Drinks on the other hand are more expensive so at the end of the nigh it would jack up the bills.  Service is friendly as our waitress constantly came to check out our table.  The annoying thing is loud speaker was constancy popping music to our ear and we had to literally yell across the table so it's not an ideal place to catch up with friends. It's definitely young crowd here as it's near UofT."}
{"text":"Worst place I've never been. The 'host' was so rude. Yelling that they were at capacity. Fair enough that they were full (even though we saw multiple tables empty) but then to be told we had to wait in the street in the middle of winter. Then the 'owner' came out to assert his authority and assure us he was 'the owner of the bar' and that the wait would only be a few minutes. After a while we saw a minimum of 5 people leave. We were a group of 3. We went inside only to be cut off and aggressively told we head to go back outside and wait even more. New gen sushi was a better place to be than here. Place is full of pumpkin spice lattes and their accompanying bros."}
{"text":"Asides from the long wait, we had a great time. Everything on the menu was indeed 4.95 but the drinks were regular restaurant prices.  Atmosphere: hip, loud, great for a casual night out Food: took a while to come, but portions were good. Taste wise it was decent, I mean it's $5 after all"}
{"text":"PROS: fun music, cheap and good food with huge portions, great atmosphere, and even room to dance by the bar at night   CONS: pretty expensive drinks (more so than any of the food), loud, crowded, and service is just okay (and why is pitch-black dining a thing??)   The concept is great and they do a good job of creating a fun atmosphere, but don't expect to be able to hear the person across the table from you.  Also, don't expect things like sides, appetizers, and desserts to cost less than main dishes.  Service is alright and they don't take reservations, so if there's a long line then you're better off going elsewhere.  Also, the lighting is all but nonexistent, which is really frustrating, but I guess it adds to their style or something.  IMPORTANT: they don't take debit and their ATM charges way too much to make a withdrawal.   All in all I'd say it's worth visiting, at least once, and the food there really is high quality for the price you're paying."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after hearing so many great things about it but the food wasn't up to par!   The food was very mediocre to me and I know it was only $5 but it just wasn't that great.   My cousin and I ordered the queso dip, mac and cheese, pulled chicken burger and the mushroom swiss burger with fries.   Our server spilt my cousins fries on her lap but only a couple fell onto the floor. She said she would come back with some more but never did. Not a big deal since there were some left but she didn't stay true to her word!  Everything tasted super bland and one dimensional. The pulled chicken burger actually had a nice sauce but the scarcity of mushrooms on my burger made me question if it even came with any. Still keeping in mind that it's only $5 but really?  The fries were good but the dip was too salty and the mac and cheese which seemed like a popular item was the biggest disappointment! Pasta was overcooked and had no real flavour.  Overall, not sure if the food was off this time or it tastes like this regularly."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner on a Friday. Staff were friendly and the bar had a familiar feel that reminded me of my undergrad days. I ordered the works burger which came with fries - was it the best burger I have ever eaten? No. But it was tasty and well worth the $4.99. Thought some beers were pricey but they must make their money somewhere. Overall, impressed and will probably add this place to my usuals."}
{"text":"I walked by this place dozens of times, but never thought to eat here until last night. I went for dinner with a friend who recommended this place. At $4.95, I was a bit skeptical. Maybe I read it wrong at that was the price of the appetizers or maybe on a specific day and times. Nope, literally, most things on the menu were $4.95 (there were substitutions which added another dollar or two). I got the works burger with fries and my friend and I shared the dill pickle wings. The burger was good; however, the fries were cold. The wings were hot and it had a hint of the pickle flavour. The service was good. I noticed that others have said the service is slow, but our server was good with the timing. Also, i don't think their pint of beer is really a pint, but then again, they do not actually say it on their menu that it is a pint so I really cannot complain about that. It is a good place to go to get some food with some friends. I went on a Tuesday early evening and the place was full but not packed. When we left, there was a line up outside, so go early before the dinner rush."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an inexpensive place to eat and not too fussy about food, this is the place for you.   All food items listed on the menu was $4.95 and they have quite a varied selection for everyone's tastebuds.    Surprisingly the food wasn't too bad for the price and the atmosphere was really relaxed.  Pints of beer averaged about $6.  Service was a little slow, but we weren't in a rush. Definitely a fun and casual place if you want a lazy afternoon to hang out. Music was a little loud, but tolerable and they played a mix of everything.   Works burger with fries seemed to be a popular item by looking around at other tables and it was quite tasty. The salt and pepper wings were simple, but flavourful (although a little on the crispy side for my liking).  The poutine was nothing to rave about as they were just okay, fries were nice and crispy, but could use a lot more hot gravy.   I will most likely venture back to try other food items since you can't go wrong with $4.95 items, could you?"}
{"text":"Group of three, and waited 30minutes in line in the rain.  Hostess came out twice in 10 minute intervals and specifically asked and searched hard and long for a group of 4, which she pulled from the END of the line. Did this twice. Instead of letting a group of three that had been waiting in line in the rain go sit .   Poor system management"}
{"text":"A favourite of the neighborhood. \"El Furny\" as it is nicknamed, offers many options of appetizers, entrees, and desserts all for under $5! The foods are delicious and surprisingly filling for the price. There are also many options of drinks at the full bar.  One criticism is the fact that its popularity means it can get quite crowded, and that the music can be too loud. Also, at times I have to wait a very long time for my order. So long that I want to walk out. All in all, a great place, if you have friends to keep you company."}
{"text":"Who can gripe too much about meals that cost only $4.95?! Better yet, the portions were good, and the food tasty and satisfying. The menu has a fairly diverse selection of pub fare - salads, burgers, tacos, finger foods, etc.  I had the mac and cheese and twisted greens salad (because you can afford to get more than one thing!!) and was quite happy with both. In fact, I'd probably pay \"standard price\" for it.  The bar was well stocked with a good variety of shooters, cocktails, and bottles. Sadly, the booze is not as cheap as the food here. They lure you in with a meal, but if you plan on making this your watering hole, you'll be paying average to slightly more for drinks.   Overall, I feel like this is something the area was lacking! Toronto is undoubtedly an expensive city, so it's nice to have a place where you can get a tasty meal, in a trendy atmosphere, and not break the bank. That being said, El Furniture Warehouse definitely isn't a \"hidden gem\" - unless you're going during a weekday afternoon, expect a lineup. I expect that once school starts up, this place is going to be crawling with college students in hunt of a cheap meal, hot guys and gals, and the infamous shotski."}
{"text":"For $5 each dish, there are some definite good deals here. Nothing gourmet but will really fill you up. Heap of spaghetti and pulled beef sandwich each 5 bucks is a steal. Will definitely be back for more simple, cheap, but filling food."}
{"text":"I ate a vegibugger and sweet potatos. I haven't tried eating soymeat before, but it has a good flavor, like pork. The texture is quite similar to meat. Also, the employees wore neat shirts and all the staff were kind. The prices were appropriate too. My friends and I had a good time."}
{"text":"I ordered the mushroom burger which came with fries and for dessert I had donuts, which tasted just like Tiny Tom's. (Soooo good!) My bill literally came to the same amount you'd pay for a combo at McDonalds.  Unfortunately, this is where the good stops, and the bad...actually scratch that - the ugly comes in.  I have never in my life experienced such rude service. Our server, who's name I unfortunately can't remember,  was horrible. This is coming from someone who normally doesn't get riled up by bad service. I just created a Yelp account to leave this review! I can tolerate a lot, but what I will not tolerate is flat out rude behavior.  It was extremely busy. We were seated at a table ideally for two, as it was quite small. A third chair was added in, but it was a bit in the way of where the staff was walking through to carry drinks/food, and my friend didn't feel 100% comfortable because people were bumping into her. The man that seated us passed by, and my friend simply asked if we could potentially switch to a booth. We did not demand. We asked if it would be possible.   He said yes.  Our server, who came to our table just as we were about to make our switch, seemed to have a disagreement with the man who told us it was okay, but she didn't turn to us and say no. Had she maybe explained that we couldn't, we wouldn't have. Again, it was seriously busy so understandable.   Anyhow, we moved. When she came back to our new table, she asked, \"Do you not need menus?\", implying that we should have brought them over from the other table. We assumed that the new table would have menus. She was being a tad snarky. Not necessary, but whatever.   What was really not necessary was the way she poured our water. She basically poured the water all over the table. It was weird. I feel like such a diva for compliaing about this, but it was bizarre. She poured it like she didn't give a damn about us. We kept trying to justify her behavior. It's busy. We're annoying for switching. She's in a rush. It's a bit dark in here, maybe she didn't see where she was pouring it?!?!! However, at the end of the day, we were polite the entire time and did nothing wrong, and she was treating us as if we had. We felt so uncomfortable at this point we almost left, when we waited in line for almost 30 mins.   I think she felt bad or something, because she was being nice after. She tried to make small talk about Beyonces new visual album and everythimg! It made me feel better...but she didn't redeem herself. She never apologized for the water thing or brought us extra napkins to wipe up the spill. We used the napkins that came with our cutlery. We thought of not tipping her but felt that to be a bit extreme lol.  All in all, the food is amazing and dirt cheap so two stars for that, but the service was terrible unfortunately. :( Even though everything we ate was so so sooo good, I don't want to come back. I'd rather go somewhere where I'm treated better, even if I have to pay triple the price! Eating out is not just about the food, but the entire experience.  I hope they can educate the staff better on dealing with stress. Please don't take out your frustrations on customers, especially when they are super nice like we were. Really wish I could remember her name. She was brunette with tattoos.   Ps - If you were our server and your reading this, we love Lemonade but we didn't want to talk to you about it!"}
{"text":"Pros: Cheap food - everything is $5 Good food portion Good presentation of food seems more than $5  Cons: Half hour line up on a week night for dinner Half hour to order food Half hour to get actual food after multiple attempts to flag down waitresses (we ordered burgers, and a mac&cheese, really easy to make good) Waitresses were rude and ignored us on numerous occasions when we tried to ask about food or ask for water (at one point one of them bluntly walked passed us to attend a new table next to us) Expensive drinks (for some reason drink came very quickly) Very loud music - excessively loud (if you are going with a group of friends looking for drink/food and catching up, good luck with the catching up part)  Overall - I would not recommend coming here as a group on any night, however, if you can manage avoid the line up and just liking to get a quick bite for $5, give it a try."}
{"text":"The vibe at this place is awesome! Great crowd, awesome  service.. and  drinks and food are cheap!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars for this one. Dingy ass, cheap. sweaty wanna be restaurant. Where really gross people work. Plz do not eat there"}
{"text":"This place has a really chill atmosphere, a great place to have a few drinks with friends, and with such a cheap menu, it seems like a great place to go The food here is one of those cases where you get what you pay for. It tastes like something a college student whipped up for me from their dorm. Our table ordered 5 dishes, all of which were very underwhelming.  If anything I would come here to for drinks and only order food if I was very hungry, I mean at the end of the day, a $5 meal isn't too bad."}
{"text":"The concept of everything on the menu being only $4.95 is great. It drew me and my boyfriend in and after hearing friends rave about this place, I knew I wanted to review it.  We went kind of nuts, ordering 4 dishes but with that low price, it was justified. We got the chicken wings, soft tacos, quesadilla, and mac & cheese.  My boyfriend got a Coke while I opted on water. We were seated quickly and noticed that this wasn't a good environment for any low-level conversations. We couldn't hear each other at all and ended up texting each other from across the table. Although the low-light offered a certain ambiance, the dark room made it really difficult to read the menu.  After our drink orders, my boyfriend got his quite quickly. After about 20 minutes of waiting for my water, we were able to flag down the waitress and inquire about the long lost water. She told us she had forgotten but was able to take our orders. About 30 minutes later, our quesadillas arrived alongside our taco order. The portion sizes of everything we got were decent and the food did fill us up. However, the food itself isn't that great. After our first rounds of food were delivered, I asked the waitress again about the missing water. She apologised profusely and said she would bring it. Finally, after about an hour, I got my water.  The tacos were described as follows: \"Soft Tacos - vegetarian, taco beef, or marinated chicken, soft flour tortillas, cheddar cheese, crisp lettuce, fresh salsa, and sour cream to dip.\" We ordered the chicken and it was nothing special. Just as the description, and nothing more. The quesadilla was a bit better. We had opted for the braised beef- \"in a flour tortilla with shredded cheddar, sautéed peppers and onions, sour cream and fresh salsa\". The sautéed peppers and onions gave the quesadilla a bit more flavour and I quite enjoyed it.  The Mac & Cheese was a huge disappointment. The Warehouse crispy Mac N' Cheese as stated on their menu is \"creamy 3 cheese, roasted red pepper Alfredo sauce, crunchy corn, fresh thyme, and a parmesan crust\". As per the description, the mac and cheese was quite creamy but it seemed bland and was lacking taste. The parmesan crust was nice except there wasn't enough of it as it was clumped up in the middle.   Crispy Chicken Wings we got was the honey garlic and it happened to be the only thing on their menu I would order again. They were nice and crispy but not heavily battered. The amount of sauce was nice and the honey garlic wasn't overpowering. Although it wasn't a light dish, it didn't seem heavy and was the highlight of the meal.  I actually don't know if I'll visit El Furniture Warehouse again, the prices are super cheap and the value of the food is good. However, quality and service is something else. Perhaps I'll visit again and try out more of the menu. Or I'll just pass and head over to New Generation across the street. We'll see."}
{"text":"Food was great for the price point and our waitress was really friendly and incredibly attentive. Hiwever, beer is above average price for the area, so if you're just going out for drinks I'd suggest hitting up one of the many other cheaper bars along bloor.   Overall, good atmosphere, cheap eats, great service. Wouldn't hesitate to go again!"}
{"text":"Great concept, poor execution. I love getting asked if I need cutlery for my pasta. $5 food that tastes like $5 food. Good in a pinch I guess. Not really my idea of going out to eat if it's something I can make at home faster.   Neat atmosphere to check out. But I would likely not return. It needs to make up its mind if it's supposed to be a bar or a restaurant."}
{"text":"Gottta love all the throwback music they play. Sitting close to the tv and getting a glimpse of these old music videos is pretty awesome too.   I'll have to revisit this location because every time I ordered food at the Queen street location, the portion size was pretty generous - not sure about here.. I got the BBQ burger and the portion size was good but the fish taco my boyfriend ordered was a joke. Literally a small grape tomatoes-sized piece of fried fish was on top of each taco.   Also I feel like their house Caesar is way too salty.   Still love this place though."}
{"text":"Bad service, dishonest about using local food, laundry list of why it's a garbage establishment is a Google away"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Service is uneven but I enjoy the food that I have had there. The onion rings have a tasty sweet honey sauce on them and the Mac and cheese has a nice kick. I'm Sure most of their money is made on the drinks-they are priced separately from the everything is $5. As the other reviewers have said-it all can add up quickly!!!   The best time to go is during the day when there are usually no lines. Night time is tough because the wait is long and hard to talk to anyone when you are there-a lot of noise."}
{"text":"I liked the idea of a 5 dollar food menu so we tried it out with a couple of friends! It was tasty and the drinks were flowing. Our waitress was so much fun and always had a smile and made us laugh. Really good time here. They had very outdated music though.. a little too outdated if they were playing 'gasolina by daddy Yankee' yikes! All in all I had a good night with good food and good people!"}
{"text":"You have to be pretty young and/or cheap to find this place a good deal. This restaurant is definitely a queen street scene, but I would have paid three times what I did to eat something not totally gross for brunch. It's a cute gimmick but if you are into food and service and can afford more than $5 a meal, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great mix of a menu.  Good selection.  All 3 dishes we got were very good !  Wait staff was very friendly. (We asked if we could pay because it was shift change. Even though we were not finished.  No debit. Music was very loud & mostly old rock,).  We would all go back though. Hopefully it would be a little quieter so we can speak more easily."}
{"text":"Went here last week. I have a back problem and asked for a seat with a back (instead of a bench) and two of the servers working refused to let me and my friends move to a booth (even though there were plenty of empty booths). I grabbed a chair to sit on instead of the bench, and another server yelled at me for moving the furniture around--this place seems to be uptight about their furniture.....  Food is cheap, everything $5 with a side of HAIR. I ordered 2 beers and the works burger w/ salad. My burger had two hairs in it. One was a long blonde hair that was tangled in with the cheese. Another was a black hair placed beneath my burger. I have dirty blonde short hair so neither were mine. This was unbelievably disgusting. Thankfully the server did not charge me for my food and removed it immediately. I didn't try the salad.   I will never go back to this horrible establishment."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto, I'd probably find myself here 3+ nights a week. My boyfriend and I are in town for a mini vacation from Buffalo and, as with all our trips, we like to find \"our bar\" in each city.  Atmosphere: We love dive bars, and the Stranger Things style Christmas lights, loud music, and music videos on the TVs make for a really fun atmosphere! Some of the songs that came on turned it into a club feel with many patrons singing and dancing along.  Service: Everyone we came in contact with was awesome, especially the tall man with the beard! Overall, service was attentive but not overbearing, which was great.  Food: $5.95 for anything on the menu, and it definitely exceeded my dive bar expectations! On the first night, my boyfriend and I split the Mac N Cheese and Fish Tacos. I would have preferred the taco shells warm, but it didn't ruin the dish for me. When we returned the second night, I got the Union Street Noodle Salad and he got the Grilled Cheese. Both were amazing!  Drink: Beers and a few drinks were MAYBE a dollar or so more than I would normally expect, but when I'm paying $5.95 for a sit down meal I'm not complaining. We tried a variety of the signature drinks, and all were impressive. The Caesar could easily be the best I've ever had, and I try Bloody beverages everywhere I go!  As far as \"cons\", I don't have much to say. It's not handicap accessible, especially the restrooms. However, I noticed this was often the case in Toronto so I assume it's not any sort of requirement. I also wish they had some games. I know it's a restaurant and a bar, but the atmosphere definitely put me in the mood for some darts or even board games. Having some sort of physical entertainment to add to the music and make more of an experience would be great.  Overall, I'll return any time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"What a piece of shit place. Owners don't give a duck about your experience. They just want to get their 18 stripper servers drunk so they can fuck them. Check their social media to see what trashy scumbags they are."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Music can be very loud. Prices are amazing for what you get but the staff can be hit and miss"}
{"text":"Formally know as The Pump, El Furniture has a great selection if booze and the food menu is a little ........ But for $5 you can't complain too much. My friend did order fries and got 6 potato skins so I'm not too sure about that. The vibe is very chilled and loud but in a good way. A great place to get your night started. The service and staff were very nice and took care of you.   I enjoyed my burger and beers :)"}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm such a fan. $5 for a decent sized portioned meal? Yes yes! We are such gluttonous people so we ordered:  Garlic shrimp Perogies Beef burger Pulled chicken burger Mac and cheese Baked apple crumble  Yup, Judge me. Haha! The best out of all of the things we ordered - the shrimp. So amazing. Everything was freaking amazing...except Mac and cheese we ordered without bacon but it came with so we sent it back (minus one star). It was that great, so I wouldn't ordered again. The service was great, server was funny. When we ordered the desserts, he said \"y'alllll still hungry!?!\".  All good."}
{"text":"Really good!! Prices are super affordable and the portions are big!! All the food was really good and the added beef to the nachos is definitely worth it.   The atmosphere was great with lovely staff. Didn't let us bring in our bubble tea but they kindly kept it waiting for us by the cash register. So nice of them!!   Overall food was great. I have been twice now and I look forward to going again and trying more things from the wide variety of food on their m"}
{"text":"Not the best bar to chill with your friends. All the food are $4.95 but everything is  not tasty or just too salty. Don't order their salads, and their burritos are very bland. The drinks are also on the pricer side. I would rather come here if all their drinks were $4.95... The service was really slow, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food and it was way too loud and difficult to have a conversation with your group.  Their interior decor is unique, but there are definitely better bars throughout the Annex and Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food for the price of $4.95. My friend and I came here for lunch and the atmosphere was pretty chill, not loud like it usually is at night. I had the Swiss mushroom burger with an upgraded side of onion rings for extra $1.95. The onion rings were amazing and the beer flavour really came through. The burger itself was really moist and the mushroom and macho sauce compliments it perfectly.  I was really full by the end of the meal and really happy with the price on the bill.   The only thing I didn't like was the service. The server didn't stop by our table at all except for take our orders and put the food on the table. It would have been nice to have our cups refilled. She also seemed to be in a rush to give us the bill when we just wanted to sit to a bit longer and talk. Meh, oh well, nothing's perfect. I guess the price and quality of food makes up for the bad service."}
{"text":"If I were still a starving university student, I would probably rate this restaurant with 4 stars instead of 3 because after all, you are getting a pretty decent meal for the price of two hot dogs. However, as a I am no longer a university student, I would say I'm looking for a bit more than just getting full on as little money as possible. (Unless you buy the drinks, then the prices are comparable to any average place. I think my beer was around $7...)  The food is not too bad and for the price you are paying, the portions are actually pretty good. The pastas are full plates of pasta and the burgers come with fries (and it's still $5!) You really do feel like you're getting your money's worth on the food. I've had most of the salads and also most of the pasta dishes. I think my favourite one is either the Works burger or the Braised Beef Dip sandwich."}
{"text":"Was so excited for the Mac and cheese-- basically looked forward to it all day. However when we arrived and were seated we had to wait over 20 minutes before our server noticed we didn't even have water yet. My bf order the works burger and we didn't have to wait too long before both was done. We were so happy cause each was only $5 but after our meal we both got really bad stomach cramps!!! Not sure if it was directly from that meal but we definitely only started feeling queazy after we ate :/ so unfortunate cause we initially liked this place a lot (we came the previous night for just drinks). Be warned that the food might be really cheap for a reason!! :o"}
{"text":"I had no idea what I was getting myself into coming here, all I knew was that it was pub food.  the line up outside to get into this place was crazy, I think we waited about 40 mins to get in. At first I was ready to walk away but after seeing people join the line behind me I had to stay.  i cannot believe how cheap the food is, ALL of the menu is $4.95!!!! I couldn't believe it!  what we had: Cheese pasta  grilled cheese  poutine  dip  enjoyed it all and for $4.95 an item, who can complain?"}
{"text":"Honestly I loved the concept but the service is very slow. The food is mediocre but the price is fair. I had the beef dipped and the dipped gravey was very salty."}
{"text":"Love this addition to my neighbourhood. The rumours are true: everything on the menu is $4.95. The portions are more than fair and the food is pretty damn tasty. I recommend the BBQ burger, quinoa salad, chorizo con queso dip with tortilla chips & their Poutine. *I suggest you say no pepper on your fries or poutine because they overload it. As for drinks, I love their Long Island Iced Teas. The music is too loud to have an actual conversation but I do love the music videos they play on the TV's. Great atmosphere overall. There is always a bit of a wait but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu for 5 bucks?! Say no more! I had a burger w fries - along with drinks. Couldn't complain one bit. Very interesting / laid back crowd for individuals aging 19-35."}
{"text":"Hi y'all.   So yesterday was my first time at the El. Let me say we had lots of fun, the atmosphere was great, the place was packed, the music was awesome, though I felt bad for the DJ due to the fact he was caged in a prison cell, and my gosh, I had probably the worst burger ever - lol, come on guys, you gotta make a better burger, mcd's burgers are better tasting.  ton conclude, a must go, but caution on the 4.95 menu, maybe stick with a liquid diet."}
{"text":"J'adore le quartier de Spadina and Bloor et sa juxtaposition de boutiques artisanales et bars de quartier. El furniture warehouse fait partie des très bonnes surprise de quartier. C'est le QG des étudiants de U of T et vous pourrez vous restaurer à un très bon prix avec des burgers, salades et autres sandwichs classiques. Grand choix de bières disponible, service sympa et rapide, on en demande pas plus."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally try this place, so when my boyfriend and I walked by and noticed there was no line we decided to give it a shot.   Our waitress was eager to get us some drinks but when we just wanted something non-alcoholic she didn't seem too happy. She told us she would give us a moment to figure out what we wanted to eat..... 20 min later she finally came back. I felt like they forgot about us and whenever we tried to flag her down it didn't work.   The food itself was really good minus the fries which were very cold, but we waited so long we didn't want to wait longer. I got the beef dip which was really good! My boyfriend got the text mex burger I believe and it was also really good for the $4.95 price tag.   I'm not one to complain about  loud music usually but for the amount of people in there on a Tuesday night I feel like they should have set the volumes a bit lower.   Maybe I will have to give this place another try!"}
{"text":"Food was really great, our waitress was so nice as well! The food obviously is incredibly cheap and well worth it. The only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is because the different things I ordered didn't compliment well. Otherwise, great place and will most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but its been a couple of times since I been here last and I feel like the food quality has definitely gotten worse. The feel like the portions have gotten smaller for the pasta even though the taste is still the same. I think they're using smaller buns for the burger now also. We got two burgers and for one of them felt like they took the buns straight out from the fridge. It was straight up cold. I know the food is $5 so you can't expect much but it has definitely changed since the last time I came. However, the atmosphere is a nice place to grab drinks with friends and the servers are super nice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch  around 3pm on a Sunday and the place was fairly packed.   Pros   Caesar was excellent  Big cahuna burger was great Server was polite   Cons  Fish Tacos felt cold Service took a little longer than it should    Overall great place"}
{"text":"If you enjoy incredibly ssslllllllllooooooooowwwwwwww and rude service, this is the place for you! $4.95 plates does NOT justify overpriced (and under-filled) bevys plus automatic 18%(!!?!?!?!??) gratuity added to your bill. The 18% is for \"groups of 5 or more\"...is that even legal? I draw one conclusion: this gives the staff permission to remain largely unpleasant and incompetent, since they don't need to earn the gratuity. They should rename the place \"Generation Y Promised Land\". No work, all reward! (This coming from a Gen Y.) Did I mention, EIGHTEEN PERCENT?"}
{"text":"Food was alright! 4.95 for the whole menu so who can complain! I had a beets and goat cheese salad, added on chicken for 2.25 (I believe). It was a good late night dinner. Portions were decent! Drinks here are OKAY. They try to upsell you to get a double for 2.50 more. I haven't tried to single so can't really compare.. Do I think it's worth it to get the double? Maybe not since it didn't really taste like a double. Drinks cost more than usual, maybe to balance out the cheap food. I will be back for the late night food!!  Atmosphere is really good :) a bit loud but the crowd is nice. A younger crowd. Very lively. There's always people going in and out. A bit loud too. We went at 11 on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty full. Only a few tables open.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell food is great service can be slow and while most items on the menu are tapa style I can't remember what I ordered when I was there which is either a good or a bad thing. Good because I guess I had no complaints. Bad because nothing was memorable.   What I did remember though was staring entirely at the TV screens jamming to the amazing hip hop music videos they were playing. I'd come back just for that. Maybe that's why I don't remember what I ate? Perhaps a salad. It seems like it would have been a salad considering I didn't hate it but it wasn't memorable because ... I mean, come on, it's a salad."}
{"text":"Fun. This place is a good time. Dj spinning some righteous tunes, cool staff and good eats make for a sweet azz time. Had the poutine, wings, prawns, beet salad and turkey sandwich and all were pretty good. Btw I shared with the wife but I could prolly eat it all myself not gonna lie. Not bad for $5. This place is a good time so chill the eff out and treat yo self."}
{"text":"Who can complain when all menu items are 4.99? Good portions and decent food! The service we had was great. Duely note they don't do pitchers only pints, that said the beers are very fairly priced. Great location in the heart of annex. It can be a long wait on the typical busy nights for bars but it's hard to find places on thurs-sat night that won't be packed. It's a great local watering hole worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great food for great price. I like the chill atmosphere and the servers.  Go for lunch! No huge lines around that time."}
{"text":"Had a really good time here! The $4.95 food is so good and normal portions - but you do pay a pretty penny for the booze. That's how bars make money! The cheap food is a good idea when drinking that much! Drinks menu is huge - and nothing is watered down. Keep you eye out for the ski shots! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out recently, because I used to enjoy having a beer at THE PUMP, the previous establishment to occupy this place.  I will admit that I have to give the management pretty good marks, because the new place certainly is re-energized.   I have seen lineups to get in.  The concept apparently comes from Whistler B.C. , with the decor in the theme of a ski cabin...  The target demographic involves going downmarket, with affordable food (so now many of the students living in the area might actually be able to eat here).    They lower the prices and try to pick up the volume of tickets.    Going after a younger crowd makes sense in this area.  An 18 year old guy might be able to pick up in here (and I do not mean cougars).  I am not 100% sure about the quality of the  meat in the pasta I ate, but the price was right.  Give the owner an \"A\" for effort.  Hopefully it will stand the test of time"}
{"text":"This review only applies if you are 25 years are older  1 star-Food is edible 1 star-Beer is Cold  -1 Star Super loud in there  -1 Star Food is barely edible and if you have tastebuds its kinda lacking. The Beer is watered down and barely drinkable -1 Star I'm not 25 and the creeping chains of my own mortality forbid me to come here anymore.   I'm never gonna be cool enough for you Mr Furniture. Have fun with your tats and your throwbacks.. best of luck when you are old like me."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to for cheap eats and some drinks! Everything on the menu is five dollars so you can't go wrong with ordering more than one thing on the menu. Second time going here and luckily there was no line and easily got a seat (although this place does get really busy and lines can get long) The food is decent for the price it is, and there are lots to choose on the menu!! This place is nothing too fancy but is the place if you're looking to grab a couple drinks and some snacks with friends!"}
{"text":"Went for a Monday night dinner with friends to El Furniture Warehouse and had a pretty great time. Their decor is very rustic with wooden tables and an open patio at the front of the restaurant. The music is also very lively so the restaurant had a very fun vibe to it, definitely directed at younger adults.   As advertised, everything on the food menu is 4.95 and you can pay extra for add-ons or additions to your meal. The drinks menu on the other hand gets a little bit steeper but there's a good variety of drinks and will appeal to many. I recommend the sour key cocktail, tasted like a spiked white freezie! They also have drink specials so make sure to ask your server.  I ordered the veggie burger and it came with avocado, corn relish, \"mucho sauce\" and a side of peppered fries. The food came to the table hot, the portion was normally sized and definitely worth the 4.95 price tag. It was good too!  if you go with groups of 5 or more, they automatically charge an 18% tip."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we didn't have an excellent service for this visit.  It was opposite. It wasn't rude, but we weren't pleased at all.  She didn't seem to want to talk or take an order.  It was only just past midnight, and she wanted to kick us out.  This unpleasant waitress delivered us a very poor and unfriendly service.  We hope we won't see her again next time.  We will ask for another server or leave.  The end."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE el furniture !! Every thing on the menu is $4.95 - plus you have an option to buy the homeless a meal or buy a beer for the chef!  They have great food, great atmosphere, great vibes and really good cocktails they also have the ski shots which is always fun. I come here often and order more then a couple dishes because why not and just because they have a bomb ass price doesn't mean they cheap out on the food.  They have amazing salads and everything on the menu is full of flavour and there are many options!   I especially love to come here for the music they always have a DJ in the evening and are open till 2am  The only downside I would say is if you have a big group make a reservation or be prepared to wait outside for awhile as this place gets pretty busy   (same thing with the queen street warehouse location )"}
{"text":"I've passed by this location and the one on queen street many times so I finally decided to check it out. It was pretty packed for a Sunday night. They've got an extensive food and drink menu. Everything on the food menu is 4.95 and I find the quality suits the price, so don't come here expecting gourmet cuisine. The drinks range from 4.99 for shots to $12+ for 2oz. drinks, which I find pretty standard pricing as well. I ordered the Caesar and it was served with a cheese curd garnish - how Canadian is that!  Major points to the excellent service and music! It made for a very enjoyable experience. I would definitely return for a quick drink and meal."}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees - my go-to for years. Yes, it's now $5.95 per item instead of $4.95 and it may not feature the best food you've ever tasted, but this is really great stuff considering you pay pennies for it.   Atmosphere - lively and upbeat with good music, a little hard to talk as it's pretty loud but that's typical of such environments anyways.  Service - not spectular, but not bad. There can be a long wait to get in (30-45mins being the worst I've faced, 5ish being the best) but the wait for food is not terrible (15-20 mins?) and the servers are friendly.   Food - really good if you pick right. The queso corn dip is a great app to share (comes with breadsticks!!!). Tomato penne is really, really good for a main course. I have not dabbled into the burger menu extensively but I tried the veggie burger once recently (Feb 2018) and it wasn't bad! Fries are good - super crispy. Portions are way more than enough (granted I'm 5'2 and don't eat a ton)  All in all, this is one of my favourites - really want to try desserts next time!"}
{"text":"Pros:  - EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS $4.95! (Excluding drinks) - Food was good for the price  - Spacious, group-friendly and bar-like setting - Great selection of alcoholic drinks (yummy cocktails!)  Cons: - There is almost always a line outside to wait for a seat (Last time I went at around 6:30PM and waited about 20 minutes for a table of two on a weeknight)"}
{"text":"Great place for anyone on a budget,although the price went up by 1 dollar it's still very reasonably priced.The menu has a wide variety of things for anyone.Myself and two other friends went around 6 on a saturday and we got seated right away and it was already pretty busy.Food came out pretty quickly.The service was a bit slower but it's a bit expected because of how busy it was.Although it wasn't my first or second time there it's always a good time...just make sure you have cash or credit because they don't accept debit!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all for cheap eats, a cool hip vibe and a great place to refresh with their yummy drinks. Everything on the menu is less than or equal to $5. The plates are super tastey and of a good size. Not too big and not too small. You wont leave hungry. That's forsure. Beautiful place to hang out on Bloor Street. Makes for a fun date or a cool place to hang out with friends.  FYI, There is always a line. That's the only bummer. Sometimes it moves fast and sometimes it doesn't. :("}
{"text":"$4.95 meals? Sure!   Food was okay. I've been here three times and recommend the perrogies. Here's the catch - cheap food means bad service. If you're looking for hostesses with an attitude or servers to ignore you - this is the place for you.   This place is almost always packed because of the cheap food. During the winter, they have a horrible system and literally make you wait on the curb. Their line system doesn't work because I can't tell you how many times I've seen people skip, and the hostess let's them in.  Ambiance is a bit grungy and loud. Cool decor. Not a place to talk, more like a place to get hammered and act like fools with your friends - which is sometimes a good thing. I do wish the place was bigger. The tables close to the bar is set up horribly! I've been bumped into so many times by servers and guests.  Chances of me coming back here are slim thanks to the bad service on all occasions."}
{"text":"The food is 'ok' - if I had to pay any more than $5, I probably wouldn't come here.  Other than that, it's got a nice casual vibe and would be a good place to go drinking with close friends.  It's probably because of the sticker price of the food, but as a note, they don't have take away containers, if you order too much food, prepare to eat too much/bring your own boxes/waste your food."}
{"text":"I love that something good took over the spot where The Pump used to be.  It would be a shame to see that awesome open front go to waste in the summer.  The menu has a good amount of variety and the standard bar old faithfuls - burgers, poutine, mac and cheese, etc. that are much better than you'd expect for $4.95.  Of course, the drinks are a little more expensive to make up for this (just an FYI, the draft beer isn't actually served in a pint glass - it's much smaller). Not really a fan of the servers running around in belly tops chomping on bubble gum, but again, it's typical of this kind of place.  I would definitely go again and if you go in the afternoon, it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Fun place, friendly service, super cheap food but bad quality. Drinks are very small and not amazing but drinkable. I'd say drinks are better than food. Music is fun. Food takes 40minutes to get to the table.  I would say this place is great for teenagers."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing prices, good drinks, sub par service, loud but fun."}
{"text":"Tell me, what's better than having a decent meal and walking out with a full belly and only having to drop $6? Very close to nothing.   This is just the place for that! Good quality food and decent service (nice waitress but rather slow at getting back to us) at a very good value. I had the Swiss mushroom burger and although it definitely wasn't the most scrumptious burger I've ever had, it was better than I expected for $4.95. The beef patty was super juicy and tender, the sauce complimented the burger well, and I enjoyed the slice of tomato that gave it a nice fresh kick. I would just comment though that the cheese was rather.. weird? Maybe a little artificial tasting? And that I didn't really notice any mushrooms? My burger had also come with a side and I chose the soup of the day, which happened to be a \"potato soup\". When it arrived, the presentation was alright - it looked like a chunkier soup and had a few scallions sticking out... but nope! I was wrong. The soup was actually very runny but had a gritty texture from the blended potatoes, I'm assuming. Overall, I found it to be too bland in flavour and it also had bits of cheese at the bottom that were also artificial tasting. It had the texture of over-chewed gum and wasn't pleasant at all. I think I'll stick to another side dish next time.  Regardless, I think for what it's worth being a sit-down restaurant and all, this place deserves 4 stars for its $4.95 all day menu and seemingly, others are fans of it too judging by how busy this restaurant is all the time!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by chance during a recent visit to Toronto and fell in-love. The vibe is great and if you aren't in a rush, a perfect place to grab a bite. Plus, they were very accommodating to my non-diary preference!   Would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting that loves a cozy, friendly environment with a fun atmosphere.   Dank drinks on deck! The pierogis were fantastic, 10/10. Not a traditional sit-down restaurant and that's why we loved it!"}
{"text":"All food is $5 so any complaints really aren't that bad when you consider what you pay. Although for a group of 6 we didn't get a hard copy of the bill, just our totals read to us (and I'm pretty sure I overpaid for mine?) That was frustrating but the food was excellent. I had a veggie burger and sweet potato fries which were DELICIOUS. The wait time for the food was a little crazy. I was surprised at how long it took but once it came it was worth it. It's not like you get a little sample for $5, it's the full shabang. A full sized burger?? Okay. Love it. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"***2.5 stars***  I've tried a similar concept before in Montreal (where everything on the menu is $5) so I was curious to see how this place would be.   When I got there, I already wasn't very impressed - it was evident that despite a lengthy line outside the restaurant, there were a couple of empty tables that weren't being filled up, which I figured was one of their marketing techniques.   After about a 20 min wait, we were seated inside. I'm not a fan of loud music of dim lighting in restaurants, and unfortunately, this place had both. However, they did have a great throwback playlist with a ton of popular songs from the early 2000's. The menu itself was also quite comprehensive and to my surprise, the food was above average. The burgers especially were pretty filling and sizable and their quinoa salad (although too salty for my liking) had a surprisingly unique taste.   Despite the food being okay, the service was definitely not. It took forever getting our waiter's attention and she ended up giving us the wrong bill, overcharging us by $18. She then took 15 mins to \"reverse the payment\" which didn't end up working and had to call her manager over. I was in a hurry so I finally just asked our waiter to pay us back the difference in cash and we ended up leaving without tipping.   If you're looking for a place with cheap eats and decently filling food, this is the place to go. But expect at least a 15-20 min wait and pretty poor service while you're there."}
{"text":"Ah mazing! Burgers are cheap and for $4.95 for food you cannot go wrong !!!!  Drink menu is plentiful and full of shots, martinis, cocktails, amd beer!  Atmosphere is super casual and super chill!  This place was packed when we went and sat at the bar.  The service was great and our food and drinks were superb!  This is a must visit if you like cheap and super tasty food!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how inexpensive all of the food and drinks are!!! Better than that, they give generous servings and the food actually tastes good especially for the price of under $5. I got the nachos for one which had more toppings than most other nachos (it even had corn on it). Plus I was given the choice to add guac and some meat for just over $1. The atmosphere is great. I love the set up of the place, it's more contemporary and edgy. The music was played really loudly BUT to compensate, it was a really good playlist"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here. Amazing bang per buck. Ordered the roasted turkey sandwich and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I think your food experience here really depends on what you order. Tonight was my first time here, but my friend had been here previously. She had a bad experience with the mac and cheese (tasted like cheese whiz sauce and lacked the crunchy top like the menu advertises), and also found the quinoa salad to be super salty the other time she came.  However, everyone was super pleased with their meals tonight. One friend had the veggie burger (she said it tasted like a really juicy big mac) and loved it. Another had the works burger (she said the toppings were very well done although the patty was just mediocre) and would order the same thing again. I had the turkey sandwich which I found to be quite tasty - the cranberry sourdough had been brushed in butter and pan fried, it seemed. Which made the bread oh so crispy and delightful. There wasn't that much turkey in the sandwich, but I preferred it that way.  In terms of sides, the salad was good but comes in a pretty small bowl. The fries, on the other hand, are sized generously, and are really good too! They're the right amount of chewy-crispyness.  We definitely plan on returning! I want to try the veggie burger next. And perhaps the quesadilla the time after.  Our waitress was really nice, and the music was a bit loud but still manageable. Didn't have to wait for a table (we got there at 6pm on a Tuesday).  I arrived hungry and left feeling full and satisfied...all for the price of $5 + tax and tip. Unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"5 dollars?  Maybe I'll go to the movies... by myself (a quote from Trading Places)  OR   maybe I'll go to El Furniture and have one of their items on the menu.  Let's be honest the food is it not super high quality but for 5 bucks I got a bacon cheese burger with fries and upgraded my fries to a poutine for 2 bucks... with a side of 8 wings or so for another 5 bucks.  This 5 dollar menu (everything on it) is an attraction sure.  Let's try to remember this place is in the Annex, you know university students have to live frugally sometimes but this place is like an oasis for that is it not?  While Ryerson has their fair share of affordable eats near by, El Furniture Bloor has affordable food for just about everybody.   Noise?  Yes it's loud.  That is the scene at this place now take the value menu and put it aside for a second.  Do they have drinks?  Yes, do the prices of the drinks make up for the affordable food?  It's fair I'd say.  As far as the music goes I would come here just for that regardless of the value menu for 5 dollar items.  A list by the way that is not just 10 items long... try tripling that.  The continuous energetic mix of music that keeps playing is a factor here because it basically makes this place feel like a club although it's a restaurant and while it's loud it's enjoyable if you like that kind of thing.  To me what makes it beyond just a mix of mish mash music (John Mellancamp vs C&C Music Factory vs Eminem feat. Nate Dogg vs Celine Dion etc etc etc) is the fact that the VIDEOS are also mixed.    So I'm having a beer, eating off a 5 dollar menu AND I'm getting to hear the eclectic sounds and sights of mixed music?  It's overwhelmingly... something.  Get into this and you'll enjoy it like I did.  If you come only for the food perhaps you'll be disappointed?  Get a drink, watch the screen and hear the mixing because it's freaking fantabulous.    Music.Video.Mixing - Love It Longtime."}
{"text":"We're looking for a place to hang out with friends after we had dinner. And one of my friends suggested to go here. However, the line was too long so we decided to find another place to chill around the area. We walked around but failed to find a place cool enough to grab a drink. So we went back and I'm glad we did cos we had a really good time! Love them ambience, the music and plus the food is decent for the price. Come in early cos there's a line every weekends!"}
{"text":"$5 for everything on the menu except for drinks = what a deal. You get what you pay for. A good place to grab finger foods, fast and cheap with friends. It has a pub ambiance so expect that noise level, so I wouldn't recommend this place for conversation haha. There are lineups to go into this place, but if you go at odd hours you may be able to get in easily. The first time I came with friends, we waited outside for 20 minutes... It's that popular, especially at hours like dinnertime or lunch. The most recent time I came here (a couple of days ago), I came around 3PM and it wasn't too busy - my friend and I grabbed some finger foods and the service was fast and friendly. For $5 you really ought not to complain about much. Their \"meal\" foods aren't the best but their finger foods/starters are pretty great. Love their salads as well. Give El Furny's a chance."}
{"text":"This is pretty much what I expected for the food being $5.00. It all just tasted... okay. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it certainly wasn't special. We got the sweet potato fries, but they weren't fully cooked, and the regular fries + chicken fingers were reminiscent of what my grandma used to make me out of a box. However, I can't deny the fact that the mini donuts were delicious.   The drinks certainly are good, which I'd hope considering they're more expensive than the food. I got the \"sour key\" which was very sour and very delicious.   Besides that, the service was good and quick and there weren't any issues there. It's always very loud and there is usually a wait, which I suppose is no surprise considering how cheap it is."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is $5.95... AND delicious! You can't beat that! It's a great place to casually get cheap food with friends, or a fun late night bar that feel like a party and you can order ski shots!  Music is always loud inside so don't come for a business meeting... or with your kids.   I docked a star because they like to make people line up when the restaurant is empty half the time."}
{"text":"Endroit parfait pour un petit snack pas cher.  Souvent bondé, le moment idéal c'est l après midi, assez facile de trouver une place. Service un peu lent mais ça vaut le coup ! J y ai passé 3 heures à boire et manger et seulement dépenser un peu plus de $20, et je bois beaucoup !"}
{"text":"Very fun spot with alot of variety and a great vibe. Very affordable and appropriate for whatever the occasion is. The donuts are a MUST!"}
{"text":"El Furniture is cross between skater punk rock and hipster central. Or maybe they are the same now who knows. Either way, el furn is definitely a cool spot to be. I used to frequent this spot before it was el furn hence my stumble upon 'restaurant' experience. The food is OK... for $5 a dish you really can't complain because its cheap and cheerful and you will most likely leave full. My only ism with el furn is that the beer isn't very cheap. For a hipster bar/resto you would think drink prices would match the food.   If you haven't been, go. You'll have your own opinions."}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap (everything $5).  The decor is very nice and unique, however the waiting time and the service is super slow. Only recommend this place if you are willing to wait for an hour and a half before getting your food to your table (including the line up)"}
{"text":"My Friend and I came here for lunch this afternoon and honestly the food is not bad at all. It did take a while like mentioned on a few other reviews but the food was great. I had the veg burger with fries and it was delicious. With their service though, I really would like to recommend  that all their staff during lunch time do work.  We were ready to take our orders, and we happened to wait for almost half and hour for someone to come serve us. They didn't give water refills either, after we finished out water. None of us had water for the rest of the time we were there.  There food is great, no doubt in that. But their services weren't like how anyone would expect, there was only 2 waiters and 1 serving the bar. There was an another waiter but she was on her phone the whole time and didn't serve anyone. All in All this place is really nice, cheap, great vibe, and delicious. But beware of how long you might have to wait since it might take a while!"}
{"text":"I had the Braised Beef dip au jus for lunch today. It's a really yummy sandwich and I felt like it was light enough for lunch! The price always helps, of course! I felt like the music level varied as well. It was still loud, but at times they were playing softer, easy listening music. I think it was somewhat dependent on the crowd in there for lunch. Next time I'm definitely going to have the quinoa salad, it seems pretty filling and it has my beloved avocados!!"}
{"text":"With $4.95 for everything on the menu, it sounds too good to be true. I've dined here several times and the food was pretty good for what I paid for. I've tried their three cheese macaroni, burger with fries, nachos, and a variety of their salads - all which were great. However, I would advise staying away from the spaghetti, which tasted like microwaved frozen food.   Their service was subpar. I've eaten here during the day where there was no line and at night when it gets busy. Getting seated wasn't quite an issue, understandably there will be a wait as it gets busier during the evening. However, I could not thoroughly enjoy my meal the last time I visited. Water, cutlery, and napkins were not given to my table of 3 over half an hour AFTER my food arrived (excluding the time that we were actually brought to our table). Had to call over 3 waiters over the span of 30 minutes and one finally brought over a cup of water. By then, my food was already cold. So despite a decent cheap meal, I couldn't eat my burger without my mouth feeling like the Sahara desert."}
{"text":"I've been here before and tried their food. For $5 it's worth the price and the size are decently portioned. However, I'm not sure if the food size has decreased now. But I came here last night with a friend for drinks only.  Drinks here are more expensive than the food because they still need to make money right? So with that being said, I ordered a cocktail \"the crazy canuk\" which is a fruity drink and definitely taste like juice. I can totally get drunk off of this. Our server tried to upsell me to get it doubled but I'm not much of a drinker. I thought one drink was enough for me, but I wanted to try my friend's drink so I ordered another cocktail \"sour key\". Both were 6.50.   This place has their own DJ spinning music and most of it were old school songs from the 90s-early 2000s. If you know those songs, it's a reminder that you're old! But the music is super loud so you're constantly yelling across the table to your friend and going HUH? That's what I hate about the place. Also, this place is always packed with uni students considering it's near UofT."}
{"text":"The first time I came here with a group of friends the experience was great, we shared mains and had drinks on a Friday.   We came again on a Wednesday about 6 of us, we arrived shared some snacks and ordered drinks around 6, the waitress came by about 5 times asking us if we wanted our bill knowing that we were waiting on more people. She was very cold and unattentitive-which was very different from our first experience. It wasn't busy so their was no reason to rush us, as it was a Wednesday. She rushed by us and paid attention to seemingly everyone else, it was our graduation dinner so we were all quite disappointed with the experience. The waitress never came by unless we waved her down. The food was good (for what is expected of 5$ meals) however if you want hot sauce you have to pay, not a big deal. But because of the poor service I can't imagine ever coming back here."}
{"text":"I like the concept of $5 menus, but the food was just so/so. We had the tacos, apple quinoa salad, potato skins, and burger. Despite all the rave, the salad was REALLY SALTY. Only the burger stood out but that's about it. It's also really loud inside that you can barely talk to each other, so I wouldn't come here if you want to chat. Also, it's super dark inside, some people dig it but I personally want to see where I'm walking.  It's an alright place but probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I have been here too many times considering I am a university student trying to eat on a low budget and this is a 4.95$ for every menu item kind of restaurant. Although the food is very good, the quality is not because of the cheap deals. This to me is like an upgraded version of a McDonald, but with a bar.   What I had: 1. BBQ burger: 8/10. This is my favorite menus item. It is worth the price you pay as it also comes with fries. I would highly recommend this. 2. Mac and cheese: 8/10. This is so very very tasty.  3. Quinoa salad: 9/10 to 7/10. I used to love this but recently it has become more and more salty, which I dislike very much. 4. Cheese tip with bread: 8/10. This is also very tasty. Highly recommend to share with friends.  Overall, you get what you pay for but I would say this is my favorite place in Toronto to eat for cheap."}
{"text":"Give this place a try - if you don't mind bad service, a Bro-y atmosphere, and tatted servers who don't care that you finished your drink a while back and would like another round. Our server had as much charm and friendliness as a zombie. The food is a great deal, but cheap, $5 meals can't make up for a total lack of care in everything else. In sum, all style, no substance."}
{"text":"The prices can't be beat. Everything is $5 but additional things like adding chicken or sauce is extra $. The service was so quick and our waitress was friendly and attentive. This would be a cool place to come back to at night for more of a bar scene as well."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to meet up with friends, all the food on the menu is $5 and the atmosphere in there breeds a good time! the music is good and nostalgic, the cheap eats are actually good (i really like the veggie burger) and of course good drink selection.  Happy to frequent this place when i am am in the area, looking forward to the next excuse to go!"}
{"text":"Got to check out El Furniture a week or so after it opened - I've been involved with the opening of a restaurant (even as an already distinct brand) and understand how difficult it is - but they seemed to do fairly well overall. It has a nice interior - I know it's probably not part of the brand - but they could have had the Jays game on a Sunday afternoon ! But I was there for food & a Caesar - drink list & menu were laid out very well. Was questioning the labeling of Amsterdams BoneShaker as a cider? Pretty sure it's nothing close to a cider - but that's my only critique on that, because I'm a beer nerd. Also don't let the cheap food fool you into thinking that the drinks must be expensive cause they aren't!!  The menu was a lot more extensive than what I expected - had a lot of decent options and the portion sizes seemed great for $4.95. We saw a few different things go by - but both ended up ordering a burger with the chorizo queso dip to start. The app & main came at the same time, but not going to criticize too much cause they are still working out their kinks.  Onto the food - Although the dip is space cheese, it has an eerie crack-like addictive quality that makes you keep eating. It comes with tortillas and toast - but the toast is kinda too soft for the dip - could definitely sub those few pieces for a few more chips.  Also it gets a bit thick after a bit, so this is one you definitely need to eat hot - but I'm sure they would definitely heat it back up for you if you asked.  The burgers were pretty substantial for the price - and came with sides! I'm picky on my fries, wasn't a huge fan of these ones (I only like hand cut) - but I did get the kale Caesar as my side which was delicious (an extra 1.95 but worth it).  All in all, with the mexi-casa app and burger meal, I felt like I was in a fancier? Nicer? Fast food restaurant - Taco Bell & McDonald's specifically. Had the same stomach pang of guilt after eating - but definitely worth a try here for sure. Id maybe go with something less greasy next time.  I think El Furniture is a great place for a session though since the drinks are decently priced - and it comes in handy that everything is decently priced when you get the munchies."}
{"text":"One star for having everything under $5, the second star for having an option to donate a meal to the homeless, and third star for decent food. You get what you pay for, however. The beet and goat cheese salad is really great. The mushroom Swiss burger is good. The Mac and cheese is bland and colourless. Warehouse Caesar is pretty good and very full of flavour, which some may actually find overpowering. I liked it though. I deducted one star, however, because of the staff and service. The staff are a bunch of pretentious, tattooed and pierced, cotton candy-haired, man-bun and beard type typical hipsters who are slow and totally think they're better than you. The service here is extremely lacklustre. If I didn't feel guilty, I wouldn't tip at all. And don't even get me started on the management."}
{"text":"I've had two totally different experiences here.   Food:  Great portion sizes and quick.  The beef dip was great.   Service: Depends on the day.  Cant say the hostess was welcoming. She actually ran customers away.  However we lucked out with a great server.  The fact the the place is affordable and plays skate/snowboarding movies ROCKS my world! (Which reminds me someone below mentioned skateboarding as hipster below!!! Since when was boarding hipster????)"}
{"text":"Munchies is so affordable in here. No wonder it's always busy with cool (vibed) attendees.  I was always curious to jump inside during Summer (they open the big window, for sure you can feel like in a shadowy patio); the good occasion never faced me. I went during night on a Monday.  I'm going to be a regular of this up vibe joint. The DJ inside a cage mixing good tunes (MIXiing with all the meaning of the word, which is different to just play...) made me realize this is one of the places with best ambiance  I've stepped inside.  A beautiful waitress would dance to try to get the crowd up, such nice movements and touch. Watching the idea of didactic go- go dancers gin action gave me the chills (I'm keeping hope).  What else? Oh yeah: porn star (check); the beer touching his belly on tap (yes); the duck (yeap); a goose couldn't be skipped cuz when in Canada..."}
{"text":"5 bucks 5 bucks 5 bucks  There's a reason there's a line up outside. The drinks are great here. I definitely recommend the margarita with the Corona.   You can't beat an entire menu that offers lots of options for $5. The food isn't 5 star quality at $5 so manage your expectations accordingly and don't be one of those disillusioned people that expect gourmet at $5.   What you can expect is a place with a great vibe, friendly service, great drinks and cheap food to keep you going!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly like the queen St location, which I've previously been to. I had the work burger and my friend had the Swiss burger. It was very very good. Not too crazy greasy but the patty could be juicier. It had some crunchy onions and the other burger fixings, like lettuce and tomatoes etc. They also had peppered fries and they did come out pretty peppered. The fries were thick and rustic with little salt, which i liked. It can in this pail that was deeper than you think. The best part was it can down to a very low price of $5.59 ( including tax ). We both left very satisfied and think place we will probably be semi regular visitors since it so close and so cheap."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time - the vibe, the food, the service and the price! We will be back!  \"The menu had a few items that resonated with us - Beer for the Chef (a happy ending for the hardworking peeps in the kitchen) as well as an end note \"buy a meal for the less fortunate for $4.95\".\"   This is just a tad of our full experience!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night and was wholly unimpressed. I guess their main drawcard is their $5 cheap meals. I like the concept but was of course concerned that the food would be fairly low rent. I wasn't wrong.  There was a lineup outside when I arrived but as my friend already had a table so I walked right past it. I was surprised to see not one but many empty tables in perfect order i.e. they weren't waiting to be cleared or anything. So I see, they were just making people queue on the street for the sake of it. My friend also mentioned that she had been to another of these locations and the hostess had made her queue outside in the rain even though there were visible empty tables. It must be their thing. Sorry, but who do you think you are...Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake? Grand Electric? Maha's? Saving Grace?  I ordered a 'woodbine julep' which is their version of a mint julep I guess. The server asked me if I would like a double, to which I replied no. My drink arrived suspiciously quickly and was in a tiny glass full of ice cubes that would be more suited to a vodka soda. Given the little room left for liquid it tasted strongly of alcohol and sugar syrup. It also had giant stalks of mint poking out. The bartender hadn't bothered to remove the stems, tear the mint or basically do anything to ensure its flavour would be a part of the cocktail. Meh, I only drank it because I paid for it.   For my meal I got the veggie burger with a side of salt and pepper fries. It was a generous portion for the price but I didn't enjoy it and couldn't bring myself to finish it. The soy patty was so processed and tasted bad for you...and not in a good way. If I'm committing dietary sins I at least want to enjoy it. The fries were fine. I definitely had buyer's remorse over my meal. I spent the next two hours regretting having ordered it.  I also thought my server was particularly poor. She just generally seemed apathetic and couldn't bring me water to save her life. I actually got water from the bar several times and she didn't even notice. She was fortunate in the fact that we had such a large party, thus ensuring gratuity was already included.  Other observations:  - It is unpleasantly and depressingly dark inside. It was evening but the darkness was still bothersome. And iit feels pretty cramped given the space was long and narrow with a lower ceiling. - The washrooms were scarily unclean looking. I washed my hands but didn't dare use the toilets. Given it was 7pm on a Tuesday and not 1am on a Sunday I found this even more unacceptable. - They have a very limited wine list including only 2-3 white or red wines and all from Australia. Given I am from Australia this prospect didn't excite me much which is why I chose not to order wine. That is beside the point, but I feel like you should pick a few different wines from a few different regions to give consumer choice. They were also too expensive in contrast to the rest of the menu prices. - They had a reasonable draft beer selection. I'd recommend ordering one of those over a cocktail even if they are the same price. - They don't take debit card - just to be difficult, illogical and annoying - Why don't they have a website or menu online? For a chain of some 10 locations that is pretty poor form.  I shan't say I will be back. Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather pay a few $$ more and eat just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"Used to come here somewhat frequently because the idea of a $5 menu is very enticing. Every time I leave though, I always tell myself to never come back. The food is okay, and you do get your bang for your buck.. I mean, it's only $5. But the service is awful. Food takes forever to come out. I got a pasta with a side salad and the waitress asked me if I wanted cutlery... Which seemed silly because how else would I eat pasta. She then returned but never got my boyfriend cutlery but we thought it was obvious he needed it too since he also got a salad. This whole process of getting forks took around 10 minutes which is enough time for our food to cool down. The restaurant is also REALLY loud that it becomes uncomfortable to try to converse, especially in large groups. There is also 15% gratuity in fine print at the bottom already added to your bill which I find my friends miss a lot of time. It's cool to try once but I dread when friends suggest El Furniture Warehouse."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the portions are huge for $5, drinks are also really delicious. I've never had exceptional service with the few times I've been here but the menu makes up for that. It definitely has a bit of a pub vibe and the waiting time is usually pretty long. My top picks: Crazy Canuck, sun dried tomato penne or the Mac and cheese, and definitely the mini donuts."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of El Furniture Warehouse!  I came here on a Saturday evening with my younger friends, who works at a bar nearby. When we arrived just after 9pm, there was a lineup but doesn't look like it's jam-packed inside, the reason for this is because table service. This is not one of those bars you walk in and stand around, they want you to be seated, be comfortable, even if you feel as though you're sitting with some strangers if you're not sat in a booth.  Their food menu is the same price for everything. For $4.95, you can get an order of wings, or bacon poutine, or burger with fries, or chicken fingers and fries, or mac and cheese, or nachos, the list goes on, but you get my drift!  I had everything I listed above, it was pretty good, the wings and fries were definitely my favourite!  For drinks, you can also have 3 or 4 shot shot-ski, shot glasses mounted on a ski to ensure that you and your mates take the shot all at the same time. Although, I would imagine some difficulties if you have one person taller or shorter than the rest of the group, but I'm sure you'd make it work.  Music is pumping and music videos on the screens (when they're not airing the local major league sports team), not so loud that you'd have to yell at your friends. The serving staff were friendly, I had no complaints!  I really like this place and I look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"Some of the items on the menu for me are either a hit or a miss for me. But its important to remember that everything (food wise) is only $5, so you shouldn't be expecting too much out of a $5 dollar meal. The atmosphere is kind of a chill/hipsterish place. Sometimes its really hard to hear your friends talking because of how crowded the place usually is on top with the booming music. The waitresses/waiter that I get are always very nice, however I'm assuming since the place is usually crowded, its difficult for them to be attentive often such as refilling waters. Although I ordered an additional food item after the initial ordering, the waitress forgot about and it was never brought out. Food usually comes out pretty quickly (in comparison to other bar/pub type restaurants). My favourites from this place are the honey garlic chicken wings, the potato skins, and the donuts!"}
{"text":"Price wise, nothing can beat this place. I expected the portions to be on the smaller side but boy was I wrong.  We ordered the quinoa and green apple salad, the works burger, the braised beef dip and the mac and cheese.  Let's start with the ABSOLUTE STAR of the meal because sadly, there was one and one only: THE BRAISED BEED DIP SANDWICH. This sandwich is absolutely and amazingly delicious. The beef was tender, the bread was soft and the dip was PURE HEAVEN. I would go back for that single dish and I would get two just to get my fix.  As for everything else: - my dining partner enjoyed his burger but didn't have anything crazy to say about it, unline the beef dip sandwich - the mac and cheese was spicy but at the same time bland. No salt whatsoever... - the quinoa and green apple salad comes in a large portion with a half avocado on top. Even though I enjoyed the combination of veggies/fruit/grain, the dressing completely ruined it for me. It just tasted like straight up soy sauce with nothing else. It made the salad overall very salty and kinda ruined it.  Food wise, I was not impressed. I will definitely be back for the braised beef sandwich though but I don't know if I will venture out and try something else or stick to this little piece of heaven.  Atmosphere wise, don't bring someone there for a first date. The noise level makes it difficult to speak. On a weekend night, I wouldn't question the music being so loud but on a Tuesday night? Kind of weird."}
{"text":"A decrepit old building with edgy snarky servers presenting food quality reflective of its cheap price."}
{"text":"It wasn't the worst, wasn't the best.  I will say that the $4.95 options are amazing and well worth the price- especially for the size of the meal that you receive.  How can they afford to sell food at this price? Because they nail you with the cost of drinks.  Almost 9 dollars for a can of cider? Outrageous.  The food was pretty good- but one funny/insane thing that I had to mention was that I ordered a burger.  They had a couple of options, and the one that I selected didn't have pickle on it, so I asked them if I could add it.  Sure- no problem (it wasn't listed anywhere as an 'extra' and I didn't think to ask for a price because it's a simple garnish and offered on other burgers.  Get the burger- no pickle.  My boyfriend told me to ask them for it, but I didn't want to be a pain.  Moments later, out comes a single slice of pickle on its own plate.  Hilarious.  Not bad tasting either.  Get the bill- they charged me 99 cents for that single slice of pickle.  That's almost an ENTIRE dollar for a SLICE of a pickle.  WHAT?  This sure makes me appreciate Harvey's pickles- they're WAY better, bigger and FAR more delicious and, even better, FREE.  That's insane.  They should be ashamed of themselves for that one.  The guy who showed us our table couldn't confirm if they even took visa and the server was nice but was trying far too hard to upsell us on every single thing and talk about our food like it was sex, which I think is their main approach.  Look great and upsell like crazy- even if it gets annoying.  I'd go back but never ask for a pickle or drink there again- or stick to pints as they were unusually of average price whereas everything else wasn't.  Bizarre.  Really loud, young crowd, trendy, Queen Westy."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  You get more than fair portion sizes for their pricing.  The food was also above the quality of their pricing.    The music was fun 80's and 90's throwbacks, but a touch loud if you don't feel like shouting at your friends.  Like really loud for a dinner spot.  As just a bar it would be perfect.    It's a UofT crowd, probably based on proximity and price.   Service was a 7.  They were slammed so I cut them a little slack, but my glass was empty for quite a while.  But the cheque came quick when we asked for it.    I also noticed it cleared out early on a Friday night.   So this might be a great option for late dinner/drinks.    It is what it is, and they don't claim to be more."}
{"text":"Came to try this place on the weekend around 11am ish. Was not very busy so we were able to choose where we wanted to sit. Found the restaurant kind of chilly because of the open patio and the weather being colder then usual. They have a big selection on their $4.95 menu. Which is awesome, for the price you pay you get a great portion. We ordered the pulled chicken burger, works burger and the mac n cheese. My works burger bun was too big so I ate my burger without it because all I could taste was bun. The mac n cheese is very filling, and the pulled chicken is well...pulled pork but with chicken. The environment is loud, it wasn't the easiest to have a conversation but I understood that it was part of the restaurants ambiance.  Overall, I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Decent food and even better prices! Can't go wrong  with their $5 menu. Expect a lineup all the time, bargain eats at it finest. Vibe is pretty dope with a live DJ spinning tunes. Friendly servers but wait times are long to get seated and to get your food. I would've given a 4 star rating if it weren't for the long wait time to get our food. Nonetheless, we would return. A few good suggestions to try out are the crispy Mac n cheese and pastas."}
{"text":"Food was cheap ($5.00) with option of ad on food like chicken for ~$2.00? My boyfriend had the burger and soup of the day. The burger was good but soup was ok. The soup of the day was carrot ginger. I had an Asian noodle dish with veggies and chicken (which I forgot the name of, but it's under big bowls). The noodle dish wasn't that great to be honest. It was not okay as it was SOAKED in soy sauce. It seemed as if the chef just put together some frozen vegetables (carrots, spinach, onion, red and green peppers) and chicken over noodles and sesame seeds to call it good. I saw other folks around me order other items under the big bowl menu like pasta and spaghetti which seemed to be more pleasing to the eyes than my soy sauce noodle soup. It was very busy when we went and service was \"ok.\" We felt like our waitress forgot about us but it -was- busy. Cheap food, food takes a while but be patient. It seemed like a bro-ey college bar with a cool atmosphere; there was a DJ playing upbeat music videos which made us dance in our chairs for sometime."}
{"text":"Came here for a pre-dinner and I love the vibe. A little more edgy than your average pub, and the food and staff are great!! We got the $5 beet salad and $5 spinach dip, which was plenty for 3 to share. Food was delicious. This place gets pretty busy Thursday to Saturday so plan around the crowd!!"}
{"text":"A dark, dingy pub that plays an eclectic mix of loud, blaring music. What I like about El Furniture is the cheap, affordable food (at $4.95), the energy, the accommodating servers, and the location. I am not too thrilled about the overpriced drinks and the sanitation problems in the lavatories. Also, the mac and cheese that we ordered was way too salty. I'll probably come back here again for a late night meal or when I'm craving some greasy bar food."}
{"text":"Food was shit, service was shit, place is shit, food was shit again. Even for the price, the food was terrible, I've had way better meals for around $5 at places that don't use that as their gimmick. The place is literally a shit hole, and have made numerous of my friends feel uncomfortable, which makes sense because of how it's literally one of the most toxic places in the city, plus nothing stood out (that was good) about this place at all. Everyone here is the losers of the whatever scenes they're in.  This place is literally everything wrong in the city in one little garbage can."}
{"text":"Warehouse Crispy Mac n Cheese (creamy 3 cheese, roasted red pepper alfredo sauce, crunchy corn flake, fresh thyme, parmesan crust) I couldn't taste the corn flakes, parmesan crust, or thyme in there but it was still undeniably tasty. Macaroni was cooked al dente and was worth the $5.95"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously trendy. I'm pretty sure tattoos, an \"alternative\" haircut and a BMI of 18 or below are part of the recruitment process...all of the staff are model hot-and really nice too! Sometimes it feels as though the staff are just hanging out as opposed to working - laughing and chilling down the back - but service still generally manages to be fast and attentive.   Prices here are the USP: all meals are $5. I expected tiny portions as a result, but nope: they're decent! Lots of add ons for extra $$$ and drinks are standard, but it's easy to have a good night here for next to nothing. Try the shot-ski, it's fun!"}
{"text":"Ok so here goes my first review on Yelp. The reason I have chosen right now to do it is solely down to how disappointed I was with El Furniture.  Ok the first thing we encountered was a queue of about 4 people. This was absolutely fine and expected that the was going to be longer so were quite happy for the short wait. Shortly after this we were brought to our seats. This is where the problems began. Not only could we barely see the menu because the place is depressingly dark inside, we were then seated literally in front of the cashiers desk (I mean it was literally like they were sitting at our table) meaning we had a good earful of all the waitresses conversations about their days in our ear throughout the entire meal.  Then it came to ordering out food. My god I get better service at McDonalds. As we ordered our starter and main course the waitress failed to acknowledge that we had ordered anything and just stared at us, took our menus and walked off. This is when things got weird.  We waited an average amount of time for our starter to arrive. We got the nachos and Potato skins and were actually quite happy with them. However half way through of starter the waitress walks over to us with 2 plates of random food and says \"oh sure you might as well have your main course now!\". She then realised after a minute that it wasn't our then disappeared without even an apology and came back 5 minutes later dropped two more plates on our table which was our food and walked off again. I'd like to add that the table we were seated at was about 2 foot by 2 foot and could barely fit 2 plates yet alone 4.  So after a game of plate tetris me and my partner finally had the table organised so we could enjoy our food. then we realised that we had no cutlery, no water, no napkins. So we then requested them and waited a further 5 minutes to receive them.  I could honestly go on and on but I've think I've made my point clear. The service was awful, staff were useless and the place is more of a fashion statement then a place to enjoy some food.  Although the food is cheap that is no excuse for how bad the quality of the main courses were. All frozen food reheated and the fries tasted like they were made hours before.  Will never go back. Ok I think I'm done."}
{"text":"Let's just keep this short...  The food wasn't that great. The service was slow. And the manager was more concerned with letting his friends skip the line-up outside and texting on his phone than actually dealing with customers.   I won't be heading back to this establishment any time soon."}
{"text":"If this was the one in Whistler it'd be getting 5 stars. But it is not and is not living up to the El Furnys name in my opinion. I walked in to be told they were keeping a line up because the kitchen staff were having trouble keeping up. That is unacceptable. They are a busy restaurant (and not even as busy as the one in Whistler) and their staff can't keep up? There are empty tables and a line outside there is a problem. There is potential and that's a good thing. Also sad they aren't playing sports videos lol although it's not the end of the world lol."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is ALWAYS what draws me to elfurny. The club-like setting x the vibing music that they play, lure me & keep me. I feel like a lot of people have higher expectations for elfurny, but you basically get what you pay for: cheap food, average portions, & food that is just \"okay.\" I've been to elfurny enough to try the majority of things on their menu.   The apps are just apps (if you want to be filled, definitely go for a burger or a sandwich! aka anything that is served with a side). The mushroom burger is alright, though a little bland. The beef sandwich is served on a really fluffy white bun, and the one thing I like about it are the fried onion strings in the sandwich itself (the rosemary au jus they serve it with smells and tastes like watered down soy sauce). The sweet potatoes are a1, as are their peppered fries (only when they're served nice and hot though, which is rarely - for me it was 1/7 times I've ordered fries lol). I've tried their asian noodles (the one time I wanted carbs, but not pasta) and it was alright - very crunchy and a lot of veggies (the portion for this was actually a lot larger than I had expected). In terms of their mac and cheese, I feel like it's overrated (a step above KD, no offense though, I LOVE KD. Issa classic!). Lastly, for dessert: the appie pie is my go to. Definitely my favourite thing off of the menu, but definitely not enough for what we pay for; the portion of apple pie resembles McDonald's, and the ice cream they serve it with is a necessity (compliments the hot pie soooo well, it'll actually leave you speechless).  The service is alright. The washrooms are fairly clean. & the wait on Friday evenings x weekends is out the door (but, the lines move pretty quickly)."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait. Me, trying to be healthy ordered the quinoa green apple salad and potato skins. The salad was definitely the wrong choice, the apples were slices were bruised and the salad was extremely salty since they overloaded it with the soy dressing. So I pretty much wasted my money ordering the salad since I could not eat it.  My friends ordered the turkey sandwich, burger with soup, wings and some noodle salad. I tried some of their food and will definitely stick to the bar food on my next visit. Overall. the portions are great for the price, quality is ok and so was the service."}
{"text":"It is intriguing to see the reviews written on here.  Everyone is raving about the service.  I can say that it was definitely sub-par and mixed with a touch of rudeness.   Scale of 1-5    Food Quality - 4 Portion - 5 Service - 2 Wait time and Host Attitude - 1   This leaves and overall grade of C.  When it comes to paying $5/dish, I guess you cannot expect perfection across the board.  If you want to enjoy a fun experience, goof location with music that is played a little too loud to have a conversation - then this is the place for you!   The menu selection is diverse the portions are huge and flavour is definitely there.    Good Cheap Eats!"}
{"text":"Not worth it mot even for the price. The staff were just like you average bar staff. The food was trash I ordered the Mac and cheese with bacon. All the noodles on top were DRY not one ounce of cheese sauce was on them then when I asked for hot sauce they said it was an extra $1.  An extra dollar for a few sprinkles of hot sauce ridiculous   Will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place is constantly *rammed*, so when I was walking by on a scorching day & saw an open seat on the patio - I jumped at the chance to try it. It's true - all entrees are $5 - between some friends we split tacos, mac & cheese & poutine.  The food was okay & perfect for nibbling on but really I fell in love with my Mojito . . . I don't know if I got lucky or they have an A+ master mixing their drinks but it was hands-down the best Mojito I've ever had.  As noted by other yelpers - it's louddd with both music and voices & there just seems to be a lot going on in general so do not come here expecting peace & quiet. A good choice for cheap eats and (obviously) great drinks. There is usually a line up so be prepared."}
{"text":"We wanted snacks so we dropped by at the warehouse and it had wings and poutine so we ordered them! $5 per item which sounded pretty wicked.  Wings were awesome! Poutine tasted good! Our server was very friendly and tentative! Great service and food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the dirtiest restaurant in Toronto. The dishes ,forks ,glasses are super dirty. Food is not bad specially the pasta is very tasty. Burger is just average. Music is the best part of dining at Els."}
{"text":"There really isn't too much to complain about when all food items on the menu are $5.  And not just tapas portions...but actual meal size portions.  The vibe is fun, there's a wicked DJ playing tunes, mixing songs, videos and the crowd is cool.  Basically if you like salt come here.  This particular location (they have another one on Queen W which in my opinion is better food wise) is quite heavy on the salt.  Like you need to drink a lot to replenish yourself after eating that much salt.  Perhaps that's where they make their $$$  But as I said it's hard to complain when it's so CHEAP and the vibe is fun!  Would I run back here...probably not..but I'd definitely stop by if I was in the area because you really can't beat $5."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better rating but I couldn't make myself do it and here's why:  1. First of all, the food was NOT good. I ordered the warehouse poutine and the gravy was bland. There was no flavour in the poutine and it basically just tasted like regular fries with cold cheese curds and watered down gravy on top. I also tried a little bit of my friend's mac and cheese and let me tell you, the macaroni was undercooked. I tried another friend's sweet potato fries and they were okay, not the best but not the worst I've tried.  2. The service was good and bad. The host was rude and almost spilled water into my friend's lap when she passed the cup to them. When I ordered my poutine, one of the servers didn't even ask who ordered it and they just dropped it on the table and left. Our server on the other hand was good. She was sweet and responded quickly to our orders.  3. The place is cramped so big groups are not ideal for this place. It's also very loud but the music was good.  4. They also check for ID but I am unsure if this place is only 18+ so make sure you check that if you decide to go.  5. The upside is that everything on the menu is $4.95 each plus tax so that's probably why it tastes the way it does.  Would I come back? No. Would I recommend this place to people? No. Skip this place and go somewhere worth the money."}
{"text":"Interesting. This place is definitely not on my radar for vibes really but I've been here a bunch to meet people. Today we moved to a couple of different tables to accommodate a growing group arriving to join us. When we parked in our last bench, a server came up explaining that a group of 8 was going to need our seats. We were promptly escorted to a place to accommodate our smaller group at the front of the bar. Understandable....not a deal at all. About an hour later, the same server came over with a round of complimentary shots as a thank you for being easy going about the move. Top notch move. The fact that the other times I've been here have been satisfactory, this particular time deserved a review. Kudos."}
{"text":"For 5 bucks you can't go wrong! Lots of good choices to select from. Our host warned us that the food might take 20-30 mins to arrive and if we were okay waiting as the restaurant was packed. Of course we were fine, and the cook proved him wrong as the food arrived in less than 10 mins! Food: I ordered a fish taco which was good for the price I paid (but not my first preference if I go visit again). The mac and cheese that my friend ordered was delicious and good quantity. Also the mushroom patty burger with fries for 5 bucks, you cant go wrong!  The ambiance and music was good. Great place, definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"douchebag hipsters and over makeup'd 20 something ladies smoking cigarettes on (and blocking) the sidewalk and saying LIKE every 4th word; awful clientele. Transphobic establishment; avoid."}
{"text":"And on the seventh day god rested... a hungry and broke god to say the least... so on the eighth day he created El Furniture Warehouse.   Then he didn't want to wait an eight day work week to go back... so he shortened the week down to 7 on Monday, then said to hell with it and went on Tuesday.  I don't blame 'em. I've been back to this place consecutive days... just cause.   Just Cause =   -It's an amazing business model  -The female AND male staff are disgustingly attractive -EVERY food item on the menu is under $5 -The food / portion size is right on point -Atmosphere breathes awesomeness  Toronto has been hurtin' for a place like this, and I'm glad we have a double dose of it with two locations in the downtown core.   This joint would get a perfect review, if it wasn't for the fact that every time I've gone SOMETHING has gone wrong:   Meals arriving at different times at the tables Forgotten items Cold fries  SLOOOOOW Service Servers who are bitter from their previous tables crummy tip on a 10 dollar bill  Pro Tips:   Go in the afternoon or later in the eve Bloor location is much nicer than the Queen location DO NOT GET THE TACOS - THEY ARE LAME DO NOT GET THE ONION RINGS - THEY ARE SUPER LAME AND ARE FROZEN Stick to the burger / salad menu Tip the staff well  No shame in sitting at the bar to eat, lots of elbow room and the  bartenders are a laugh and a half DO NOT GET THE PAN BREAD FOR AN EXTRA $2 - TINIEST LAME BREAD AND HUGE RIP OFF ... PAY 2 DOLLARS MORE AND GET A SECOND MEAL.   Even having some pitfalls... a lot it seems now that I typed it all out... why do I keep going back ?  Am I in an abusive relationship with a premium dive bar or is this God's will ?"}
{"text":"I don't really like the dark gloomy kinda atmosphere, but i guess because it's a bar, it should be that way. But with the price only for $4.95 is quite satisfying, it's hard to find a place that sell hamburger and chips that cheap. The tastes of the food is also good, I ordered their famous work burgers and their perogies for starters. The most unpleasant thing about the place is their pineapple juice, the taste of it's so horrible. I thought that i would get a very nice freshly squeezed pineapple juice, but what i got is a sour taste syrup. But overall, i'll definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I thought the vibe would be genuine, unfortunately it feels very manufactured. The positive things were that the female servers were dressed respectably and not exploited. The 90's music was great and nostalgic. But overall this place is trying really hard to cultivate the feeling of chill partying with the stench of branding and inauthenticity.  The social media pages are offensive and sexist, much like restaurant work culture. Typical male restaurant management using women's bodies to sell food and drink. Their old instagram page also used photographers work to promote their business without permission and sometimes without credit. It's not appropriate to use artist's work to promote your business unless you pay for it and/or have explicit permission. Also they posted a job fair for restaurant staff and called it a \"Casting call\". What are you casting for? A musical? I would laugh this off as stupid and cute if I wasn't an actor who goes to actual casting calls.  I got the quinoa salad which was so salty I had to ask them if they could fix it, which they did... a little bit. I also ordered the tacos, which had almost no meat in them. On top of that I had a glass of wine. After all that I felt like I had eaten a light snack.... I'm a thin female....  My friend's perogies were delicious though, I wish I ordered those instead, they were worth the $5. My food was not.  Overall I spent about $20 and by the time I got home I had to cook more food because I didn't feel full."}
{"text":"The vibes in here are great! I came to the annex location twice and the queen west one a few times without looking at the reviews just heard about the ski shots and had to try this place. I prefer the bloor location for some reason. When I went the other day, our server was this bearded hipster man. The beards in this whole place are killer, could be a show in its own right. During the day, lunch here is crazy as the bill comes up to like $5/person. I was blown away that this even exists in Toronto especially since it's in such a prime area. For the price ski bums pay, the food is actually mighty tasty. I'll keep coming back because of the friendly staff, food/drink and atmosphere it reminds me of being in a ski cabin. I want to come to the bloor location at night to finally try my luck at those ski shots. Pretty stoked for that day to come."}
{"text":"There's a girl in there who doesn't recognise anything other than an Ontario ID...she was rude and sent us away. Had to get the manager to give us the okay."}
{"text":"Really, really, REALLY good. Of course everyone knows it's $5 everything. With that being said, it's cheaper than a Big Mac meal at McDonalds ... With better ambience food quality and you feel classier saying you went here then McDonald's.   I came here twice, once or lunch and once for dinner.   Lunch: Quinoa Salad  SO. GOOD. It's extremely filling for a salad first of all and they fill it up with all that foodie goodness like kale, avocado and apples too! I would definitely come again just for this.   Dinner: Chicken Wrapped in a Tomato Tortilla  I have no clue how they can afford to do this... El Furniture gave me more than half a foot long tortilla that was stuffed with chicken and greens. On too of that they gave you a side of either soup or fries and I chose the soup (win for brocollliiiiiii soup!!!!). I couldn't even finish the wrap so I had to take half of it to go. And the best thing was that all of this was only $5...   So the ambience. The first time I went for lunch, we got seated near the front so service was always attentive and our server even left a little smiley face on our receipt :)   When I went for dinner though, we were kind of placed a bit further back into the restaurant for our server wasn't quite as attentive and it was difficult to get much attention ... It kind of felt like being shafted. But honestly, our server was brilliant. She was really nice and it was busy.   The place has a sort of hipster feel to it with skateboarding videos on each screen. The drinks menu is relatively cheap as well.   I would definitely recommend this place for a gathering as it's cheap food, cool ambience and a great place to eat. Everyone will be happy:)"}
{"text":"This place was great! It's a great place for students to hang out and everything is super cheap!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've given anyone full points for anything, but this place really deserves it. I can't find anything to complain about. The service, the food, the music, the caramel sauce they serve with their desserts, the salsa, everything - perfect!   This place really understands flavour. Balances spicy and tangy and creamy really well. Well done!"}
{"text":"There's nothing to dislike about this place. It offers cheap lunch and delicious food. Service was good as well. Would definitely recommend this place especially if you're a broke UofT student looking for an affordable balanced lunch.  I ordered salt and pepper wings and it was too salty. Also the service can be a little bit slower but then again you're only paying $5 so it's alright."}
{"text":"If you want some good cheap food here, look. I further. I couldn't believe all the food was really just $5. Drinks are more, which is where they are making their money. I liked my cocktails too. Across the street almost from Lee's Palace, so a good place to grab something before a show. Place is usually busy, even on weekdays. Tables move fast though. Service was what you'd expect for a dive-esque place in the Annex. I'd go back though. Oh and they had great music variety and played the music videos on TV screens."}
{"text":"My bf and I went there at around 7pm on a Friday night and there were around two parties in front of us. We didn't need to wait long since we picked the bar. It may take longer if you choose the table.  All the food on the menu is $4.95 each. At first we thought the portion wouldn't be big but oh man it's decent size. We ordered a poutine (it has bacon bits), a works burger ( it tasted fresh, patty was juice, crispy onion and bacon, chilled lettuce), and a Mac and cheese ( this one was ok... Average..)  Overall we were happy with the visit ;) After the dinner we went to trinity church for a concert ;)  Happy Friday ;)"}
{"text":"Loud music and cheap food would be the highlight of this place.  Usually expects 30-45 mins line up. Lots of young people come here for food and drinks.   The service is low tire. Once I was refused to enter because I didn't bring my ID but I told them I just simply want to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and the food is always good (dill chicken wings!) this is my first negative experience with the staff.   First, if you want to do takeout, expect to pay an additional $2 per item.   During the lunch rush today, there was only one guy in the kitchen, servers were quick to warn me to \"expect a bit of a wait\" - I wasn't offered water or acknowledged at all until i got my food.   All in all, good food for $5 but there are plenty of other great restaurants around the Annex if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! The majority of the items on the menu cost only around $5! I've been here about three times and I will continue to come back. The macaroni and cheese was very tasty, but the cheese was a bit too much heavy for me. The works burger was just delicious along with the regular fries I got as a side. The BBQ chicken burger wasn't up to par with the works burger in my opinion. Something about this burger didn't taste so great and was a bit sickening to finish. You could also get onion rings as a side instead, but they cost more. The nachos are a bit spicy, which I have trouble with at times, but oh my, they have such a rich taste to them. The workers are generally nice and during my most recent visit here, our server was beyond kind and genuinely offered amazing service. I'm not too sure if there is free wifi here as my phone automatically connects to a store nearby called Curbside Cycle. The only downside to this place would be that they take forever to make and bring the food out. If you are on a tight budget or want burgers that's not from Mcdonalds, you need to try this place out asap!"}
{"text":"Yet another Vancouver-based chain branching out to Toronto.  El Furniture Warehouse has a pretty good formula: no bar liquor licensing issues, all food is $5, sell by alcohol in volume and profit.  It's inspired many other 'resto-bars' in Vancouver that open in the vicinity of full bars and clubs.  As a guy that doesn't normally like to eat while drinking (yes, I draw a difference between 'eating-while-drinking' and 'drinking-while-eating' and 'snacking-while-drinking') joints like this only come into play as I wind down a drinking session - the smooth transition between 'last drink of the night' to 'post drinking munchies'.  I don't frequent places like this as I inevitably get the \"Please order some food if you want to keep ordering drinks\" tap - and other places would using have the convenient $2 'filler' item (which can barely be considered food) for situations like this.  On the flip side, this is not a place you would want to eat while sober.  Not that the food is bad, just very middle of the road frat party type food (as you would expect for $5 each).  However, the beer selection is very limited, so I was going to give it two stars.  However, someone at our table ordered a shotski, which is 4 shots glasses mounted on a ski.  Which, even for this crotchety old man, was a lot of fun.  It's just so good when it hits your lips."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite bars in the area. First thing is the atmosphere, whenever I come in with my friends we always seem to have a great time just from the servers, music and how happy everyone seems to be in there. They play oldies and the latest hits that everyone knows and the whole restaurant ends up singing along, its honestly great. Next the food, I mean for a student $5 for a full plate of food is literal gold. I recommend the perogies with all the fixings!! Soooooo good. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"It's fine. If you go to El Furniture Warehouse, that's the pervading thought you'll walk away with. (Then again, who could ask anything more of a joint that proudly advertises an entire menu of dishes under $5?)  So we decided to share the Yam Fries, which arrived to the table piping hot. They're fine (surprise, surprise), but no different than something you could do at home from a product out of a bag. The accompanying \"macho sauce\" has a nice, tangy zip to it, so at least there's that.  I will note, as well, that the music was oppressively loud and the service was comically non-existent. Our waitress, when she did appear, seemed nice enough, but she would also vanish for long stretches of time. Everyone at the table probably would've ordered more drinks had she not been so impossible to track down."}
{"text":"Absolute joke. Waited outside for 1 hour at 11pm on a Monday night. Had 4 parties behind us go in. Also there were quite a bit of empty tables as could see from outside. We were told we have attitude because we asked how long the wait would be. Chloe, please learn how to talk to a human being. As with the other bloke doing line and bussing. After waiting for 35 mins, he came and told us the wait would be another \"5-10\" mins. After asking why as there were plenty of tables and we'd gladly take one in the back or somewhere with not a lot of space, he said \"Be grateful I even told you that; I could have just let you stand and not told you anything\". Put on a proper tank top, mate.   Food wasn't anything special; only decent thing about this place is the prices; $4.95 for everything on the food menu. Servers have attitude as well. If you want to be treated like dirt, please come here!"}
{"text":"foods cheap, cant complain about quality of food for that price. however, service is horrendous, plates and chairs are disgustingly dirty. I went to the hostess to ask to pay my bill after waiting 10 minutes to do so since the machine is where he is. he says i have to wait for my server so i waited another 5 minutes just to pay the bill that I had already received. wont be coming back."}
{"text":"- What I tried:     + Macaroni: very tasty, definitely much better from kraft dinner lol I was really enjoyed this dish. Highly recommend this     + Work burger: i think you add $1 something for poutine on a side. The burger itself was pretty good, but the poutine was just ok, the fries were not even crispy. - Portion: enough for a meal, not too full - Price: cheap $5 everything  - great and quick customer service"}
{"text":"Yet another update to this review based on our experience last night. A group of 4 of us were supposed to meet for dinner. I got there first and had to yell and mime \"4\" at the host for him to understand that I wanted a table for 4. This was a harbinger of things to come. He took me to the table straight away, and I was immediately overwhelmed by how LOUD it was in there. It was way too loud to hold a conversation, and actually uncomfortably loud to the point where I wanted ear plugs. I think the problem is that they don't have a good enough sound system to support the volume, so it just sounds like chaos in there. I was worried that I might just be getting old, but the first screamed words out of my husband's mouth when he arrived were, \"Why is it so stupidly loud in here?\". He asked the waitress if the music could be turned down, she said no, we stuck it out for another 5 mins or so but it was clearly too loud to just deal with it, so we ended up leaving. We met our friends outside and went somewhere else instead. I see that other Yelpers have also mentioned that it's stupidly loud, so maybe they'll get the message and regulate their freaking auditory situation. BUT, like I said in my previous review, the food is super cheap and pretty good, so I may be back again, only at lunch time when the music's quieter! In other news, get off my lawn!!! ;)"}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly delicious for $5.00 but if you go expecting cheap drinks, you may be disappointed.   The service was great (my friend and I sat at the bar) but the atmosphere is a little bit hipstery-douchey and there's usually a bit of a wait.  With all this being said, I can't say I was blown away but it's a great place to go eat if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"This place easily earns its 3 stars for its food and the pricing. It's a pretty big menu with lots of different options so it's fun to come and try different things out. The Union St Noodle Salad and the Spaghetti with Braised Beef are my two go to meals. Drinks are overpriced, but I guess that makes sense given how cheap the meals are. I always spring for the mixed drinks with the Corona, you pay $13+ but it's two drinks in one which makes up for it.  The worst part about this place is that at night half the servers come in when they're not working to drink, so servers on the job disappear for 30 min at a time to hang out with their coworkers. (If you're looking for your server look at the big booth in the corner just off to the side of the bar - they're usually dicking around there).   TIPS:  I'd recommend coming here during the day if possible, there's usually no line up and service is a lot quicker.  Avoid this place on game nights - before or after any sports game this place is nuts and the line is down the street.  There's a patio open in the summer, but the tables are so close together which makes seating a little uncomfortable.  Also check out their brunch menu prior to 2/3pm - the chicken and waffle sandwich is definitely on of my faves."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite places to go to downtown. The environment is so chill, good music and the food is amazing. My absolute favourite is the mac and cheese, I literally go each and every time for that meal.  Only downside to this place is that the line is formed outside so during the winter it's really cold to wait."}
{"text":"I came with my friend to eat here. The service was alright not bad (so we thought). My friend was disappointed with her food because it tasted different then before. There was too much cheese in her pasta and it had barely any sauce. My burger was good.  However, when we were paying for our bills we didn't tip our server (yet). I paid by credit card so I was planning to tip with some change I had in my purse. My friend paid with cash and was going to tip her after she got her change. But then, that server then came up to us and asked us,  \"Is there anything wrong was my service today?\"  We told her that there wasn't anything wrong with her service and then she told us, \"You should be tipping your servers.\"  She said something along those lines and she said something about losing money. After we heard that, we obviously didn't tip her at all. Why should we giving a tip for that attitude of hers? I wish I remembered her name.  Overall, never coming here again."}
{"text":"If only this place was closer to home!! The food here looks really good and the kahuna burger I had was so good! The sauce and pineapple slices.... oh man I want another one! Pretty easy to find and the staff are very friendly!   Definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Just to clarify, They don't sell furniture here!  Probably my favourite place to grab a bite to eat when I have completely no idea what I want to eat plus EVERYTHING on the menu is $4.95. Even huge salad bowls packed with veggies, steak and avocado's, definitely makes eating healthy cheap and easy. Heck it would probably cost me more to buy all those ingredients and make the salad myself. Despite how cheap and delicious their salads are you'll probably see me gorging on a mushroom burger and fries or bowl of ravioli or probably both since it's just that cheap.   Shots are pretty cheap here too, you can do a skateboard shot here with your friends too. Basically 4-5 of shots on a skateboard that you and your friends lift and drink all at the same time. Thanks to my taller and stronger friend this resulted in the shot spilling all over me the first round but they gave me another one on the house which I thought was really nice.   The music and atmosphere here are really nice too, my favourite spot to spend a Friday evening. Just try go early because it gets pretty busy and there usually is a line for a table.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, I'm sure you can find something you like on the menu :)"}
{"text":"This place was actually a lot better than I expected it to be after reading a lot of the reviews. The wait was pretty long when my boyfriend and I showed up but after seeing the cost, we decided to stay. Once we got in, we ordered the potato skins and nachos to start, and the spaghetti and BBQ burger for the meal. Our starters came pretty quickly, which was a relief after the long wait. The nachos were pretty good and the skins were seasoned very nicely. The mains were served quickly after. The burger was spicy and a good portion and the pasta was a good size and the sauce was decent. The only complaints I have was the service was not really that good considering we didn't really have a server and it was pretty dark in there for a restaurant. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins to get in on a Wednesday night and the food wasn't even worth $4.95! Decor was based around being in a cabin in Whistler but the food tasted extremely cheap and our table felt sick afterwards. Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan because of the prices and service that I received. I received very good service because I was given a booth when I had initially arrived and was waiting for my friend for approximately 30 minutes. Even with a line up outside and the fact that a single person was occupying a four seater , the staff did not rush me and were polite. I appreciate that!  Food and Drinks  All the food is $5! and the portions are fairly sized! They are not tiny portions, they are meal like portions. I loved that! I like that they had virgin drinks.. because I sometimes I just don't want alcohol. My virgin Caesar was only $2.75! How awesome is that.   I tried the potato skins, which were delicious and $5. The asian noodle salad with chicken was good as well but I expected the noodles to be crispy versus softer cooked ones, the salad came in a big bowl and still $5. I also tried the crispy wings.. a bit over cooked but awesome for $5.   My friend got a burger and could not finish it... again $5.  We ended our meal with a tiny donuts... with a side of caramel..OMG !!!!!! You HAVE TO TRY IT !!!! Sooo soooo soooo good!!! I want some now!!.. $5.   Alcoholic drinks are more but reasonable.. the awesome food menu is  $5!!!"}
{"text":"Time from ordering until food arrived: 5 minutes.  Caveat, it was the wrong order.    Time from ordering to water showing up: 10 minutes.  Time from ordering until food proper showed up: 17 minutes.   When it arrived my burger was soggy as (I'm pretty sure by the way the bbq sauce oozed out in a specific pattern) it was part of the original wrong order, but!  Still tasty.  The fries are delicious in the goo from the Mac and cheese.  You will be ignored, get your food, then be ignored, the pay.  I actually dig this style.  It's not pretending to be anything more than it is.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I came for dinner on a Friday night. It took 45 minutes for us to get our food. I know it is cheap and I didn't expect five star dining, but when it came to the actual food it was even lower than my already paltry expectations:  1. Braised beef Spaghetti - sauce was dry and clumped together, barely any beef. I've had many leftover spaghetti meals that tasted better than this  2. Chicken and Fingers - again, nothing special. Dry chicken fingers. Super starchy fries as well.   3. Burger with sweet potato fries - burger was decent and the only reason this isn't a 1 star review. Fries tasted store bought  All in all, it tasted and felt like microwaved food, which is acceptable for the price, I guess. But I don't understand why it would take so long to make things that taste so bland.   As for service, I our server was in the back most of the time and we could only find her in the vicinity 20% of the time, and she was never actually around when we needed to order/get the bill/check up on our ridiculously basic dishes."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the bartenders are super nice. The only downside now is that they raised the price from 4.95 to 5.95. But it's not a huge deal breaker."}
{"text":"Food is great and so is the price point.. Also we had great service  NOW....the music is WAY too loud. I DL'd an app to measure the sound levels at 90 Decibels. The Ministry of Labour only allows 2 hours of exposure to this noise level."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, fair drink prices, food is 5,95$ all day. and also there's really cool music.   Kind of a Canadian version of hooters haha"}
{"text":"This place is awful!   While the food is cheap. The burgers are that of the frozen patty variety, heated on the grill= disgusting!   The glasses are chipped, meaning bacteria could leach right into your mouth uf you're not aware a sly little chip is there on the rim.   The goat cheese and beet salad was alright. Pretty sure the beets were from a can, flavorless at best and the chicken added for $2.25 extra wasn't a lot and was rather dry.   This is a good place if you don't care what you put in your body, are looking for cheap food; in quality, taste and for your pocket. And if you like the pub scene: loud music, barely audible for conversation between two people or more.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"To say it quickly;  Come here with a big group and hole up in a booth for the evening. They have great drinks and good spacefor a fun evening. When it gets late and you're hungry bite into their $5 dishes. They had ample veggie options and the chiang mai noodles were amazing!   My only qualm with the place was the very loud music and awful music videos that you can't avoid because of the plethora of screens."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! Whenever I am near the area, I would eat here. In business class, you learn that value comes from the price and the quality, and this place scores well in both categories. SERIOUSLY, EVERYTHING (FOOD-RELATED) IS $5. And the food is GOOD, i'm not talking about a cheap-ass burger and fries are a separate $5, NO! Their Works burger (comes with fries) is $5, and its delicious!  I  think their mac-and cheese deserves a really good praise, beacuse its lovely and cheesy. I've never been to the restaurant on a hangover, but if i did, the mac and cheese would be my choice of food. its THAT kidn of good  After every meal, you should eat the donuts, its warm, delicious and dipped in the caramel sauce satisfies every sweet craving you have ever had  MUST TRY"}
{"text":"A couple of months ago I was walking around downtown core and came around this bar and decided to try it out. The lineup was very hectic so I left and decided to try it out in the afternoon of May, with my luck the lineup this time was short. I ordered the mac and cheese which i heard good reviews of and also nachos which came w sour cream and salsa. The food was very tasty and the bartender was very friendly. I also ordered the Blue Hawaii cocktail which in my opinion was lacking the taste of alcohol and tasted more like fruit punch. Overall my experience at El Furniture was great and the music was interesting."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at El Furniture Warehouse.  It was fairly quiet when we got there just after 5pm.  It was really busy when we left an hour later.  Everything on the menu is $4.95.  I'd been to their other location, Queen Street Warehouse, last year and enjoyed it.  I'd ordered the Works Burger there and it was good.  That's what Gord ordered this evening.  He said it was a great burger.  I felt like chicken and ordered the BBQ Chicken Burger.  It was just okay ... there wasn't a lot of chicken on it.  I imagine it's a hardier burger with the cheese, onion strings and lettuce I asked not be on it.  I'll stick with the burger next time as I know it's good and a better deal for me.  Leah was our server.  She was friendly and chatty."}
{"text":"This fun place still remains as my favourite bar that has a great atmosphere , cheap food which is so tasty and creative drinks. The staff are meh, they're fun to look at (so hipster cool and good looking) but you don't come here for the service. They have vegan and vegetarian options which is a huge selling point. My favourites on their menu : grilled cheese , fries/poutine , chicken fingers and any of their ceaser !!!! There's always a line Thursday-Sunday so get there early!!!"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with food under $5.    They don't allow drinks from outside so be prepared to chug your Starbucks or throw it away.  The food is not so bad. Like I said, can't go wrong with anything under $5 BUCKS.   A lot of good food choices.  Also, be prepared to pay a little more for that domestic pint. Jacked up the prices of drinks to make it for the $4.95 food menu.  3 stars because it took half an hour to get our food on Monday at 4:30 PM. And because out servers attitude could use an improvement."}
{"text":"Service at the bar tends to be extremely slow. I practically had to send a raven to get the bartender to order more drinks, and again to get the bill.  Food is surprisingly good for the price (everything on the menu is $5.95 without adding extras). Drinks are priced alright, but are sadly quite weak.  Music is sometimes too loud, but the place has a cool skater/grunge vibe and atmosphere. Music is unnecessarily DJed, and often features retro 90s hits with music videos playing on screens."}
{"text":"Cheap food that's worth compromising your dignity for.  I'm writing this review after my second visit.  I came here the second time in 3 days because I enjoyed the food for the price point.  However, the second night we came, the way we were treated was simply brutal.  I understand that lowered food priced means compromised service, but customers deserve common curtesy.   Hey server #20.  Thanks for talking to us like we don't understand English.  Thanks for throwing the credit machine on our plate.  Thanks for bringing our food so late that it's cold and telling us that it's \"normal\" to wait for 30 minutes for our food.  Thanks for talking smack about us to your two friends hanging out at the bar (yeah we saw).  Just because you get automatic tips for parties over 5 doesnt mean you can be demeaning.  Next time, at least wait for your customers to leave before running your mouth."}
{"text":"Cheap quality food and cheap quality pricing. It's not bad at all if you know what you're getting into.   It's a simple please all spot. I'd much rather come here than a pub to hang out and catch up with friends.    It does get packed though -it perfectly competes with the green room in attracting students and hipsters in the area."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a quick bite yesterday and it was what I expected, nothing better, nothing worse.   Food was as good as it could get for $5- and they have quite a few options; you can get a pint for about $5.50 and a cocktail for up to $12.    It gets pretty busy at meal-times and you may have to wait for about 30-45 mins.    Food comes out reasonably quickly, servers are on their game, music is a great and atmosphere has a hipster-grunge vibe."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to go to this place on a whim after a long day of furniture shopping (no pun intended). By the time we got there it was already quite late so I was unsure of the $4.95 menu items would be enough to satisfy my appetite. Boy, was I wrong.  The menu presented us with about 30 different food options. They ranged from burgers and fries to garlic prawns. There are also several veggie options for those who are interested. We got the mac and cheese, pulled chicken burger, garlic prawn and spaghetti with braised beef between the two of us.  Each dish came in pretty large portions and the presentation was well above what we expected. The burger came with a variety of toppings and the chicken was amazing (so rare to find pulled chicken in my opinion anyway!). The mac and cheese and the garlic prawns were also very well made and a must have at this place. The only thing that was only mediocre was the spaghetti - but thats just me trying to find something to blame in the food.  Overall the food far exceeded my expectations.  The atmosphere was also quite different. It was pretty clear that it was a student hotspot because of the music and the proximity to University of Toronto. It's kind of a half-way point between a restaurant and bar since some people were just there for the drinks and dancing. This could be a turnoff for some but we didn't really mind.  The reason I took away a star is because of the long lines and the volume of the music. Seriously, we were sitting right across from each other and could barely hear what we were saying. I don't even know how the staff could stand working there for an entire day.   Another point is that the food took a long time to get to our table but the wait was well worth it."}
{"text":"You would think that a place this cheap would have lousy service and bland food. You can only believe my shock when I realized that this place has cheap prices paired with reasonable quantities and some pretty decent service.   El Furniture Warehouse is a great looking restaurant that's perfect for spending and afternoon with friends. I've have a couple of meals here and while it isn't always a flavorful dish, it's still fresh and pretty filling.   I think the most surprising thing is the service. I find cheaper places tend to have staff members who are unhappy. I have had consistently friendly or at least nice service from my waitresses.  Just keep in mind this is a $5 place, so bring $5 expectations with you and you'll be happy. If you're not a college kid or not prepared for food to be great *for $5*, then don't visit.  Also beers are regular price."}
{"text":"Keep your transphobic comments and photos to yourself.  I will never set foot in this business again. You want the Gay communities support but then instagram transphobic hate."}
{"text":"My friend and I checked out this place on a gorgeous day and the \"windows were open.\"  She mentioned everything was $5 and under which was a seller but the portion sizes are still huge. We both got the beet and goat cheese salad and I got the nachos which were alright....a bit salty.  Service was good, the place was packed and line ups are expected."}
{"text":"A fan for sure.  Very good tasting food for more than reasonable price and great looking friendly staff.  What more could you ask for?  Cheaper beer would be nice.  Paid a lot $$ for a can of domestic Labatts Blue.  Did I say can??  Anyway, that aside, poutine was awesome as was the french dip brisket sandwich with side salad.  Service was a tad on the slow side but I think that was more because the place was packed.  I didn't see a server loafing, they were just really busy."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for - nuff said. The bf and I stopped into this restaurant for a late, slightly hungover lunch after running errands. We both ordered caesars, he got the works burger with poutine, I had the BBQ chicken burger with onion rings. BF liked the caesar, but I found it had way too much horseradish. He found his burger and poutine good but not  outstanding, definitely nothing to write home about.   My burger was a huge disappointment - basically a pile of French's crispy onions and a puddle of BBQ sauce between a bun. I actually thought they forgot my chicken, I couldn't find it. Some digging through the puddle of sauce uncovered tiny chunks of what I think was chicken. Needless to say I wasn't impressed.   And the onion rings, of which I'm usually a big fan, were truly awful. The batter tasted so yeasty I had beer breath walking out of that restaurant. Bf was not a fan either. Maybe I should be giving this restaurant three stars because I shouldn't have had even middling expectations for a restaurant where everything is priced at $5 but I can't bring myself to do it. It gets two stars because our waitress was a gem and the music was absolutely fantastic.  TLDR; food sucks, music is on point"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this spot. It's definetly one of my favorite get together spots in downtown Toronto. I prefer the summer season or lunch times, just because the crowds are calmer.  There's usually line ups for night time or weekends. Other than that it's a pretty friendly and chill environment."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. The food is cheap and so good. The service is amazing and the music is AMAZING. This spot actually has a DJ spinning amazing tunes at all hours of the day.   Where else in Toronto can you get an amazing burger and fries for $5? El Furniture Warehouse makes the IMPOSSIBLE BECOME POSSIBLE by providing amazing food and great service for an incredibly cheap place.   This place will never disappoint.  I'm so glad...SO GLAD for this place when I have $5 in my pocket and I'm craving a good meal. Heaven on Earth for a cheap meal and good service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is amazing!  From the music to the food to the PRICE!!  They offer $4.95 plus taxes all day menu that has a huge selection. I had gotten the nachos and they were really good. They charge you generally $1 extra for anything extra thats not included on ur order.  I also ordered the burger and fries which are pretty good for the price The music and entertainment is great, they usually have a live DJ along with music videos to the songs Only negative thing is expect to wait a while to get your food because of how busy they are. Also,If you want to come later at night expect to wait to get in."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place.. Although I should've been a little suspicious when nobody ever said \"Let's go to El Furniture Warehouse because they have great service!\"   I am just going to start with the postitives. First has got to be the pricing of everything under $5. I mean you can't really go wrong with that since this area is surrounded by students from Highschool and University. The pricing is great for people who don't have tons of money to spend on some places located in the Annex. So that is definitely a great reason to come to this place.   In terms of the quality of food.. I mean you get what you pay for. I thought that everything was decently good tasting. I got the Braised Beef Spaghetti, Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and a Mac and Cheese with bacon bits. Overall my favorite dish was the salad, second, Spaghetti and lastly the Mac and cheese. Everything was cooked well.. Nothing burnt or under cooked.   Now with my experience. This is what I was so disappointed in the most when I got there. Let me just explain what I experienced  yesterday (Oct 23.14):   Around 1PM my boyfriend and I decided to eat at El Furniture Warehouse since many people had recommended me to go. It is close to campus with cheap prices! Since I didn't have to work and it was pretty much a day off it was a great time to go. I thought going for a late lunch would be great.   As we walked up to the place I noticed two people looking at the menu.. I guess they were deciding on take out. I notice immediately that it wasn't as busy as I've seen this place at night. Which was great - since we should be seated right away, right? WRONG! My boyfriend and I stood there trying to figure out, since it was our first time there, if it was a self seating place or if we had to wait for someone to have us seated. Finally after about a few minutes staring around awkwardly at each other and the people behind us, who were also waiting to be seated a waitress comes from the back and looks like she is going to get us seated. At first she was going to seat us at a high table that sits two people and across the bar but then she quickly asked us if we preferred to on the upper platform area at a table enough to sit four and we agreed to sit some where more spacious.   Now this is something that I always do at every restaurant since I get thirsty quickly I told the waitress as she was about to leave to seat the other people behind us to get us two glasses of water to start. She said yes and continued her way down and sitting the other customers. As my boyfriend and I are deciding to pick what to eat we are looking around about 10 minutes later (maybe longer) still wondering where our water is. Finally I told him to bug another waitress who was wiping down a table near us to grab us water.. She said okay and in about 2 minutes our waitress brought us the water. I mean I would be a lot more understanding if it was extremely busy and if she had to wait for our food to be prepared and cooked but it's just water from a tap.. I couldn't believe we didn't just got our waters right away. I mean we had a girl on our left sitting near us who was seated AFTER we were and got her cocktail almost instantly well before we got our water. I just thought that was ridiculous.   Finally when she brought the water we wasted no time to order our food so that we didn't have to wait so long for it to come out like our water. We used the time it took for the water to come out as an indicator as to how long the food would take and boy were we right! We ordered like I mentioned previously: beet salad, Mac and cheese and spaghetti. I think it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend and I were both on our phones and trying to kill the time until our food arrived. When it arrived I was very happy with my selection though. Everything looked great.   Until my boyfriend noticed right away on his Mac and cheese that they had forgotten the bacon bits! (Which the waitress actually suggested) Honestly he was so fed up with waiting for everything to come out that he almost didn't want to return it. However I am not like that.. I thought if you're going to suggest something and get your customers wanting to add items to their food then you shouldn't forget it. So it took us almost a few awkward minutes trying to wave a waitress in this not so busy place down. When we told her that she forgot she went \"Oh yeah I am so sorry about that\" and quickly went to the back sprinkled some bacon and popped back without dish. This is something I just cannot understand.  Why was it that it seemed so busy for the waitress when there wasn't that many customers in the place to begin with. Anyways after all of this waiting game my boyfriend and I ate all of our food quickly and just wanted to get out of there. We paid for our meals I think I came to $18? And we just put a $20 down and left.   What a frustrating experience. :(  -CL"}
{"text":"Food was okay, Im willing to try again because of the cheap prices. I love the peach ice tea. The waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The only complaint I have is the service was pretty slow. I ordered the quinoa and green apple salad, delicious and great value for $4.95!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice so far, and value wise in terms of the food, it's a really good deal. Food all day is $5 and the burgers come with various sides.  The food isn't spectacular- but it's $5 so I can't complain.   Service was fast and friendly, and the general ambience of the place is great. Lots of seating and there is also a bar available. When there is a line, they make you wait outside so if it seems really busy and it's cold out, I wouldn't stay just because there are other bars available.   The drinks here are great, around $6.50 for many of the mixed drinks and different shots for $4.50. If you get a double for the mixed drink, it adds $3.50 which we thought was a little bit too much but the drink itself was so good we didn't mind. Your bill will definitely start to add up if everyone orders doubles so keep that in mind.   Overall, I really like this place and will probably be coming back."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is AMAZING, can't beat $4.95! The drinks are also great, I loved the blind melon and sour candy one. Great vibes and great servers! I was visiting from Sacramento and I wish these were in California!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices, excellent food quality for the price, good service, good atmosphere. All in all, good place to spend an evening with group of friends."}
{"text":"My obsession other than food is scoring a great deal. When you combine food and an awesome deal together, I cannot resist (hence why I always end up back at The Old Spaghetti Factory). So when I saw the buzz about El Furniture Warehouse, a restaurant with a very odd name, I wanted to check it out. The restaurant serves everything on the menu for $4.95 (excluding alcohol). I took three of my girlfriends to El Furniture Warehouse to see what the hype was all about.  We arrived to the semi-busy pub around 3 PM on a Wednesday. We were told that no outside drinks were allowed since my friend brought in her water bottle. It was a rule in case people planned on bringing their own alcohol. The waitress allowed my friend to keep it out and said that it was just something to keep in mind for the future. When we were looking at the menus, my friend pointed out how the alcohol were overpriced. I wasn't surprised because everything on their food menu was only $4.95. They had to make more money elsewhere.  For my order, I chose the Warehouse Crispy Mac N' Cheese. I liked the crispy layer on the top because it was a nice twist. I enjoyed it in the beginning. However halfway through the meal, I felt that they added too much seasoning and the taste became overwhelming. Nonetheless, I finished my plate because I still liked Mac N' Cheese. My friend who ordered the Beer Batter Onion Rings and Soft Beef Tacos liked the food she got. We all collectively agreed (aside from the one friend who hates onions) that the onion rings were the best. My friend who ordered the Quinoa and Green Apple Salad liked it at first but was disappointed that all the soy sauce seeped to the bottom of her bowl. Lastly, my friend who ordered the Braised Beef Spaghetti was not happy with her order. She didn't like it overall and thought it was something that could easily be whipped up at home. I ended up finishing her plate.  There was a 50/50 split with everyone's opinions. Two of my friends said they would not come back, because they didn't like the quality of the food. My other friend said she wouldn't mind, though it would not be on top of her list when choosing a restaurant. I, on the other hand, am a sucker for cheap food. I like that it is a nice open pub and all the food have good portions. I hear from other bloggers that other items on the menu are really tasty. Since El Furniture Warehouse offers an array of food, I would like to check out what else they have."}
{"text":"This place was good considering each meal was 5 bucks. Didn't have to wait more then 10 mins tires for a table. We got served right away by a staff member and a trainee. They told us the special drinks right away and we're attentive.   The restaurant was so dark, blasting music and was boiling hot. I got the fish tacos and wings.  My sister got the Caesar salad and they put kale in it as well which was yummy.  My wings were good, 1lbs for $5. My fish tacos were good but the portion of fish was hardly even there compared to all the toppings.  Overall, service was good and food was good.  I would like to go back maybe for drinks."}
{"text":"When walking into this place, you have to keep in mind that every food item on the menu is $4.95. Don't expect an upscale restaurant with food and service to match, and you'll be very satisfied.   You get great portions, tasty food, and a variety of choices on their menu - what's not to like? It definitely gets busy, especially on the weekends and evenings, but if you can get in and get a seat, you'll have a good experience. The servers are attentive and the DJ has great taste in music (although it was a bit loud).   I'm leaving four stars instead of five only because of the drinks - not because they cost more than normal (I understand that they have to in order to make up for the cheap food), but because they just aren't very good. I don't know what it is but the balance is all wrong in their mixed drinks.   I'll still be back, but just won't be ordering their mixed drinks and will stick to beer."}
{"text":"So I put me and my fiancé on a budget so we were looking for cheap eats on yelp and found this place I previously saw a couple of my snapchat friends post food pics of this place so, we decided to check it out. The service was good I can't complain, I had a drink called the blue Hawaiian I believe it was and it was so good if you like tropical coconut rum drinks. I ordered the mac n cheese and he had ordered the penne pasta and chicken wings. Surprisingly enough for food that's only $4.94 a plate I was shook. It was so delicious! After we left we agreed that we'll definitely be back again soon.  This place is great especially if your in college and on a budget! Check it out !!"}
{"text":"Great food and great vibes! My friends and I certainly were not expecting such great food for the price. We individually tried (and shared) the macaroni, the burger and the quesadilla, and I can honestly say they were awesome. Our waitress was a lot of fun and checked in on us regularly.  I loved the music choice but wish it had been not as loud as it was hard to chat over food and drinks, but that would be my only complaint.  Overall we all really enjoyed the visit!"}
{"text":"Great food at unbelievable prices....Literally everything is $4.99! We tried the veggy burger and the roast turkey sandwich, both came with a choice of fries/salad. Flavor was good but it wasn't anything particularly memorable. But still, the presentation and the quality of the food for that price??? Insane!"}
{"text":"Great selection with a variety of foods, all for $4.95! I come here when I get the chance and getting their burgers are always worth the price."}
{"text":"I love the concept of El Furniture Warehouse.   Every single food item here is $4.95 and there is enough selection here to make everyone happy. Seriously, I don't expect much at this price point but the Braised Beef Dip Sandwich we shared was really good and even the fries was well seasoned and crispy!  Drinks can be pricey compared to other watering holes in the area. I would stay with beer on taps for $6.25. I really don't understand how they can charge $8 for a tall boy.  Music is loud but at least I could still hear what my friend was saying and with all the televisions around, maybe he did not even really want to talk to me?!   Service was meh. We never really have a wait staff looking after our table.   I will be back for some cheap snacks and drinks (shots?)  next time when I am in the area. A nice casual place to chill out with friends!  We were lucky as there was no line up for our early pre dinner drink on a Sunday. I can imagine how busy El Furniture can be on a Friday or Saturday night!"}
{"text":"$5 everything on the menu! Can't go wrong. Drinks okay prices, beer a little much. The fish tacos are okay, quesadillas are pretty good, and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed the burgers. Overall it's a pretty noisy and busy place, not great if you want to hold a conversation. But it's still fun and food is cheap, decent place to go one and a while! 4 entrees plus tip turned out to be $25. Everyone should try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap food. The drinks/cocktails aren't cheap and they don't do pitchers. They push for a double shot in their drinks but I found that it doesn't taste like it had much alcohol in it to begin with. The line seems manufactured at times but I do see that they reserve bigger tables for bigger groups. The place is generally packed with great eye candy and great music as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing and the female Dj rocks and this is the only reason you got the star.   but I was disappointed that my Cesar the bartender served me was a zombie celery. can you please cut off the dead brown parts before serving a cesar ....... OK i dldn't lose my cool but dont munching on the zombie veggie.  Also can you advise the chef it doest hurt adding a bit of salt and black pepper,  passion wouldnt hurt either,  with all the reviews I read I can admit you people are not passionate about food or eat at McDs or th regular and do not know what good food is ... Maybe next time I see if there is any improvements, but mostly will not be back"}
{"text":"$4.95 all day deal is a good idea for this place. It's actually a way for you to try out their menu because it's really affordable. I was expecting mediocrity, I've misjudged it because of the price. The burger's juicy and the sauce was really good. I just didn't like the idea that they don't have an option for gluten free or whole grain buns. The place was warm and looks like a really nice place to just chill and relax. The interior was cozy. Customer service is not bad. I will try the rest of their menu and maybe have a beer or two as well!"}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago with a friend on a Tuesday evening. There was about a 30 min lineup at the door, but we managed to skip the line by agreeing to take two seats in the corner of the bar. As a result, we were attended to by the two bartenders, who were friendly, but who got busier and less attentive as the evening went on. In particular, it was difficult to get their attention when we wanted to grab our bill, and also when they forgot to bring my friend utensils to eat her mac and cheese with.   El Furny's main selling point is that every food item on the menu is $4.95, which is a RIDICULOUSLY good deal in downtown Toronto, hence this place's popularity. I got a burger with fries, and my friend got the mac and cheese, which she said was delicious. While the burger wasn't mindblowingly spectacular or anything, I really can't complain for the price, since both the burger and fries were better than fast food quality and did exceed my expectations. They also have an extensive drink menu, with various beers and cocktails, although they're not nearly as cheap as the food (about $6-$8 for a pint).   Ended up being about $22 per person for a meal and two beers each, which was pretty good. While I enjoyed my experience and would definitely go back, I would only do so if I didn't have to wait in line for a long time, since the food, while good, wasn't amazing enough to warrant standing in line for 30+ mins. I also did like the vibe here, which was lively (there was still a line outside when we left at 9 PM), but also laid back and unpretentious."}
{"text":"As someone who has experience in customer service I have to say the service at this Warehouse location is extremely inhospitable?. The hostesses are rude and condescending?. Last night the blonde hostess at the door (who did not initially identify herself as an employee) spoke to me and my friends as though we were complete idiots and was very dismissive. After several minutes dealing with her, we chose to leave and seek better service elsewhere. This is not our first negative experience at this location and we will not be going back. DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"$5 menu is definitely nice, but that's the only positive I can think of about this place. Service is plain rude. There were multiple tables open when my friends and I arrived, but the employee.. bus boy.. or waiter.. whoever he was, told us to wait outside while he cleaned the tables and that someone would be out shortly to seat us. The tables were already clean. We saw someone clean them.. on top of that we waited outside and no one took our names down or anything - we were the only ones out there. I don't get why places like this even operate. The whole point of a business is to make money, why would you want to treat a potential customer like this? Anyway, we ended up at The Fry and had some pretty bomb fried chicken & beer. We ended up spending more than if we were to eat at El Furniture, but I absolutely have no regrets.   This would have been my second time at El Furniture. The first time I had the poutine and it was what you would expect for a $5 meal; bland. I'm pretty sure the bartender charged me for a couple extra beers, so if you're ordering a bunch make sure to count. I feel like it's the only way they can make a couple extra bucks to make up for their low margin food.  I probably won't even try to come back. They usually have a long line of youngins. After living in the area a while I've discovered a lot of tastier and cheaper alternatives. Like across the street at Future or Green Room."}
{"text":"I've never experienced a worse experience at an establishment . After our waitress forgot to bring us about three things, and my food arrived at room temperature. Me and my friends didn't find the service good at all, so we didn't tip her that much. After she prints off her receipts she proceeds to tell us we had a large bill and only tipped her a certain amount, and said we didn't know how tipping works. Basically telling us we had to tip her more. After all I said was alright she rolls her eyes and walks off in a huff. I am not obligated to tip for poor service. Also, after everything you order they ask you if you want to add something on for a dollar or two which gets quite annoying, and basically makes it the price of any other place. One order will not fill you as they are basically snack sized. Completely overrated and clearly don't know how to train their staff not to be bratty and disrespectful. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"I love the pulled chicken and the works burger and the server I've had each time is awesome."}
{"text":"Probably my most favorite place in downtown Toronto. It could get a bit noisy sometimes but who cares... The food is amazing, service is fast, everything is so cheap. Always a first choice when I'm hungry/just looking for a drink!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Awful service and extremely poor management skills. Beers taste like water. Avoid this company and locations at all cost."}
{"text":"sometimes there is a line and it can be too noisy but in general food prices are great and food is rather good, worth twice as much. we mostly don't drink. service is sometimes slow but mostly its full so I guess its not a wonder. love both locations."}
{"text":"There's pretty much a line up here all the time from the $5.00 food menu. I've been here once when it first opened and again recently (September 2017). I've had the chicken caesar wrap, the swiss mushroom burger, and their wings, and nachos. All the food is mediocre all around. The portions are surprisingly big for $5 but there was nothing special about the food. The ceasar wrap was really heavy on mayonnaise, mushroom burger didn't really taste like mushroom. The best thing I've had here so far is probably the wings. At $5, they serve around 10 wings and they were pretty good.   They have a pretty interesting drink menu that ranges from your beers and some specialty cocktails that are about $10-12 depending on what you get. I got the a rum and corona mix and it was quite good!   Other than that, service was fast and it's super loud."}
{"text":"Great for a bite when you're nearby and not looking to spend more than maybe $10 on dinner! I have tried almost everything on the menu between this location and the one on Queen Street, and I can say all the food is pretty great and of good portions for the price! Some meals are better than others, but that's to be expected of course.   The drinks can get a little pricey, but the shots are usually a good bet, for around $5 each for the cheaper shots and they go up to about $7, I believe. The mixed drinks are usually very nicely made and fruity but will run up your bill quite a bit. The line can get unbearable too, especially in the summer or on weekends but I haven't ever chosen to wait in those lines, so I can't tell you how that experience would go.   The music can get horribly loud here, usually you end up yelling across the table at your friends, so don't take a date here. The place is not the cleanest either, the bathrooms always need work and the tables are perpetually sticky. If you're not dressed up like you're going clubbing, you seem not to get as great service. It's also normally pretty full, so food might take some time getting to your table. I ordered the donuts with some friends once and we waited about 30 minutes before it arrived at our table.   tl;dr: Definitely drop by if you're in the area and don't mind spending 1-2 hours on a meal, and aren't picky about a little mess."}
{"text":"If you get hella stoked by overpriced and undersized pints, standoffish service, screaming to be heard over lame music, inexplicable line-ups and an apparently genuine commitment to alienating the community - in other words, if you're willing to sacrifice your dignity all to eat $5 poutine - well, bro, this place is totally your jam."}
{"text":"Decent quality comfort food affordable prices I loved the poutine don't Ike a few of their extra addons for the bacon and the drinks are a bit pricy but its all in all a good deal"}
{"text":"I give El Furniture a 3 star because of the price.. the price you just can't beat. The food is not really the best, it is very greasy and non-healthy. But you can't expect anything else for $5. There is usually a line at the door but doesn't tend to take too long before you get the seat. The atmosphere is nice, but very loud. Service is okay at best."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I try to come here as much as I can.   The food, for $5, is better than some food I've received at restaurants where I paid quadruple the amount.   These guys clearly make their money on alcohol and the place is ALWAYS pumping. Which is a no brainer when you have such a young, hip vibe, gangsta music banging and a $5 menu.   One of the coolest establishments I've been to. The service was awesome last visit. Can't remember my servers name (white chick, tatted, wearing a wife beater). she was fantastic.   Best bang for your buck here! 4/5 hands down."}
{"text":"I just finished throwing up, the food (my Burger) tasted bad as I couldn't finish it and there it was, it showed up a few hours later with me getting sick. Please make sure your food is sanitary and not giving people food poisoning. I just found out (a day later) that both my friend who ate with me ended up sick last night also."}
{"text":"Bad service. Waiters took too long and hardly acknowledged us. Our food took 40 mins and it wasnt even that good."}
