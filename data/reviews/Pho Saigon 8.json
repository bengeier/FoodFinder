{"text":"I came here with expectations after reading some reviews here. I have to say the service was not as bad as I thought it would be. It is your average Asian resto service. Distant and quick. I got the pho with just the noodles and it was better than Pho Kim Long's! They do not give you a lot of mint and sprouts like Pho Kim Long but I am sure if you ask for more they will give you more. The large was not that big but it was enough for me. They have bigger bowls at Pho Kim Long. Over all I say its not bad. I will come back here just because the Pho was great. Service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work. As long as they do their job right, you do not have to be my BFF."}
{"text":"This place is super clean (major bonus points!) and they have great vegetarian pho.  I am mostly restaurant vegetarian and it's hard to find pho that is not either a beef or chicken broth.  Their's (I think called tofu/vegetable) is very flavorful, salty, and comes with a platter of very fresh veggies to arrange in your soup as you like.  My husband and I each get a large bowl- it is huge and takes forever to eat!  Their fresh spring rolls (the cold ones) are good, but not the best i've had.  The sweet sauce that comes with them is great.  Major bonus points for a place that offers a veg pho on par with the traditional beef one!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for Pho since we were soo done with the Vegas mass grazing from last night.  The Pho here is decent as far as Vegas goes and the broth doesn't taste artificially sweet like some places when they load the MSG in there. Their bean sprouts are super clean and white which is a good indication they do it right. We may come back again if we have a Pho craving while in Vegas. Oh don't order the Che Ba Mau dessert it is a rip off!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of pho restaurants in this town. This one is my favorite for 3 reasons. 

Reason #1 - It's got the word \"pho\" in the name, so you know it's good.

Reason #2 - They are from \"Saigon\", where pho was invented, so you know they know what they are doing here.

Reason #3 - The number \"8\" is a very humbling number to give ones self. It's better then 5 and not as douchey as 10.  So you know they've got class.

Yup, the humblest, most authenticest, phoiest restaurant on Eastern. Much better than Pho Saigon 7 and less pretentious then Pho Saigon 9.  

Till next Tuesday Pho Saigon 8, when my parents will pay for my dinner again!!"}
{"text":"Best pho on this side of town.  Not as good as the Spring Mountain location, but a really good substitute when you can't make it across town.  Egg rolls are the bomb, chicken bun is one of my faves, and the #31 is my go to dish!

Biggest drawback is the service is kind of slow.  Food comes out pretty quick but sometimes it can be a wait to get drinks and/or the check."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho!
Great service, very attentive on busy Holiday weekend
All ingredients fresh and tasty.
What more is there to say."}
{"text":"The service is mediocre and the pho is not bad . The meat in the pho was tough and hard to chew . My lil one ordered the BBQ chicken and it was delivered to us In a matter of minutes after ordering . After cutting into the chicken I realized that the chicken had been cooked earlier in the day or yesterday perhaps ( def not fresh) and reheated once we ordered . I asked the Waiter bout this and he informed me that \" we cook the chicken half way and finish the cooking when ordered, otherwise it would take 30 min or so to cook\". Now I know it doesn't take more then 5-7 min to cook a thin slice of chicken . The chicken is a direct reflection of how they run their kitchen . I've been eating vietnamese for a long time and I will never return to this place . The prices are a lil above the avg. for this food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We always come here to get our pho fix & the staff here is great. They see that we have a toddler and automatically come out w/ our waters & of course a styrofoam cup w/ a lid on it w/o even having to ask them for it. 

Typically we like to share our pho w/ my son rather than ordering him his own bowl. So we'll ask for an extra bowl and along w/ the extra bowl we asked for, they bring out scissors (to cut the noodles and the meat) and plastic silverware. I love the fact that they knew and we didn't have to ask for every single thing. Never disappointed and their food is delicious!!

Our usual order is,
#1 crispy fried egg roll
#20, noodle with rare eye round, flank & beef ball"}
{"text":"We had the noodle soup and rice dish.  The food quality is just OK.  Another \"run of the mill\" Vietnamese noodle food.  Nothing special - just OK.  Not sure why others rate them high.

It is on the expensive side for Vietnamese noodle soup.  The extra large bowl was $8.25 but the size is just a regular size bowl when compare with other restaurant.  A good thing - they do wash and clean their bean sprouts.  The rice and pork chop just come with 1 piece of very THIN AND DRIED CHOP with plenty of rice - again not much food for the amount that they charge for the dish.  NOT GOOD.

I have to agree with a couple of other reivews.  NOT MUCH SERVICE.  They just drop the food.  NOT VERY HELPFUL asking about the menu.   COMMUNICATION IS LIMITED. 

WATCH OUT FOR THE MANDATORY 15% TIPs FOR PARTY OF 6 OR MORE -  EVEN THEY ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL WITH THE SERVICE.  IT IS BURIED IN THE BILL.  I ENDED UP PAYING THE TIPs TWICE FOR NO SERVICE.  WATCH OUT!

The bill was a little over $100 for a party of 6.  I think there are better choices to go for the amount that we spent."}
{"text":"if i could give 0 stars i would ! caterpillars in my soup?? so gross ! even when we told them they said bugs are in the vegetables, no discount, still payed full price for soup that had bugs ?? never coming back"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I always try to make my way here. Both their Henderson and Spring Mountain locations are great (I haven't tried their newest location on Eastern yet). The broth here is what makes it so good. I always get the pho tai gan (comes with the steak and soft tendons). Honestly, it's the only one I've tried. It's such a long time between trips out to Vegas, that I'm always craving the same thing. If you haven't had pho before, there is hoisin sauce and siracha or another chili sauce (siracha is the more spicy kind with the green top, the other kind is in the cup with the spoon. I'm a weak asian so I go for the less spicy kind :X) that I usually mix together in a small sauce dish and dip my noodles into it.

To drink, they have amazing coconut water. It's so sweet and refreshing. If you want to be healthy, order the kind from the fresh young coconut (not as sweet, but still very good). For any of you asian readers, the che 3 mau (three bean dessert with coconut milk) is so reminiscent of our childhood. I'm not really sure how it tastes to westerners, but the dessert is definitely top 5 on my dessert list.

{"text":"Since this is a restaurant, I'm going to review on my bowl of Bun Bo Hue first.  It's just a bowl of noodle soup, doesn't have the Bun Bo Hue flavor.

Cleanliness, there was a fly in the bowl of my noodle soup... need me to say more???

Service, worst than their food.  Waitress turned her back on us when we tried to order, didn't apologize when I told her about the fly and just took the bowl away.   The manager DEMANDED that we have to leave tips because we had 10 people when we don't want to.  We paid for our food without gratuities, the manager ran after us and said that we eat and run, and he's going to call the police to report us.  All these time I thought gratuity = reward for good services

Pho Saigon 8, this was my first and last.  Before you tell anyone that we're cheap, please tell them the real reason why we didn't want to leave tips.  Just for your information, this is the very first time I left a restaurant without leaving tips regardless I have been to many bad restaurants but your service trump them all."}
{"text":"Great Pho and grilled pork is excellent. They gave us a very generous amount of soft tendon and fatty brisket in the pho."}
{"text":"Very few noodles in the big bowl of broth... 2 small shrimp and non-existent crab.

Good BBQ pork roll, but the peanut sauce was way too thick and tasted like they mixed bean puree in it."}
{"text":"We didn't have the pho, so take this review with a grain of salt.  We both had the vermicelli noodle bowls, one with grilled chicken and eggrolls, and one with grilled pork and shrimp with eggrolls.  The amount of meat and vegetables in the bowls was a little lacking, and the meat itself was a bit fatty.  The service was really quick and friendly though.  Others looked like they were enjoying the pho, so we'll have to try that next time!"}
{"text":"I am giving a one star for bad experience with the staff and not the food. Happened to be there during lunch from work and decided to experiment with seafood and shrimp pho(#43). The food when it came to the table smelled completely off and rotten that even turned a few heads from neighboring tables. On complaining to the server about the foul taste and requesting to change the dish, they blatantly refused. I told them that I had not tried the dish, and the smell told the entire story. They refused a refund or change to a different dish, and had me reorder a second dish and pay for both.

This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant considering I eat out at least once a day. They have probably lost more than one customer today as the friends who were with me were baffled at this as well and have decided not to go back to the place."}
{"text":"wow, whoever thought in the desert wasteland known as las vegas, amongst the gambling, strip clubs, and dirty dirties, lies the gem of a pho place known as pho saigon 8. 

this place is pretty darn tasty. as per ritual, i always sip the soup before i massacre it with mints, lime, chilis, sriracha, and bean sprouts. excellent broth. a weeee bit too salty, but theres no complaints there. u can defintely taste the thirst coming an hour later.

wow they sure give a whole lot of meat. and it tastes good meat too. tender, juicy meat. yum.

noodles were just right. just chewy, and even after awhile, didn't sog up. good good noodles. 

i also got the three color drink. it was a bit small. and the tapioca things didn't have the cruncy chestnuts inside like i like them. but it was pretty good. 

service was even decent. and my friends all loved the hot chicks rollin in.  but i din't think they were so hot. 

all in all, a good pho place."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place the service was the absolute worst. They're were plenty of staff but not sure what their problem with.  I had to ask for refills napkins. I asked for children chopsticks,  a staff member literally took rubber bands and dropped in the table. Didn't even attempt to make them for me. The service was slow and rude. Never again will I be back. They're are better pho places in this town with betrer service and food. I was extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food here. I try to stop here each time I come into town. I Have tried many different options on the menu but, I keep going back to their beef pho. Service isn't the greatest, they take your order bring your drink and most times you don't get a refill unless you wave someone down. But the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and the food has been consistently good and service adequate with a few exceptions but I am moved to report today my pitiful experience. Fried egg rolls and beef pho the former came out small and burnt the latter didn't come at all. I ate the egg rolls and thought oh well but I was basically ignored while the wait staff entertained themselves. Decided to leave after 25 min. And I was one of only a handful of customers, not like they were busy you know.honestly the place has been in decline for some time now. Come on guys straighten up."}
{"text":"it was very disappointed with the pho soup here compared to the location in Henderson. the pho soup was super sweet, either too much sugar or msg. The tea cup were a bit greasy. I don't think we'll be coming back to this location, Henderson was far much better, cleaner, food taste better, friendly service, much much better."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. I liked the soup's flavor and the food arrived quickly. The charbroiled chicken vermicelli was flavorful as well. This place fills up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"They have your typical variety of Vietnamese food here. The food tastes very mediocre and bland. Although the portions are a bit on the larger size which is good. This would be a decent place to go eat at if the other Vietnamese restaurants in the area are extremely busy and you're extremely hungry. Other than that, it's just not too bad."}
{"text":"Order so rice and waited for over half an hour.  We end up cancelling the orders and left.   Didn't even get a sorry.  Horrible service.   Don't ever come here."}
{"text":"It was better when they opened, but now I'd rather drive the half hour to get service.   The food quality varies on time of day or time that you show up.  As the day draws to a close, the broth resembles water and salt thrown in a bowl with oil.

But as the others said, service is in the pits.  Once we were seated and they completely forgot to take our order for like 15 minutes-then we left.  Be sure to order two drinks and water for yourself, because once they throw you food  on your table they'll never check up on you.   

Also the tables are cramped so close together so if you and the person scoot your seats together, you'd practically be siamese twins."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get Pho soup!"}
{"text":"Went here on a hot hot hot day and wasn't very excited to eat any soup never mind a tripe soup.

I was forced to go and thought it was very good.  My friends told me that this is the best place since its such a clean soup and not oily.  

It was good but I cant say its the best until I try more Pho places.  

The tripe in this soup is so pleasant in comparison to the menudo stuff Mexicans swear by.  Its really hard to explain the texture but its more noodle like vs the chewy raw squid stuff in the menudo.

The shrimp rolls were big winners on the hot day too."}
{"text":"Driving from Red Rock to Paris Hotel, I was looking for a Pho resturant
like I always do when I am in town. My buddy in the car pointed out at Pho Saigon 8 as we were driving down spring mountain. What the hell, I said as always. Already tried 5 different spots and all came up short of being good Pho. Got seated and was brought these huge, color, and pictured menu. Right off the back I knew this place was a real authentic Vietnamese joint. 

Went here 3 times in 2 day.enough said.
Pho tai large : soup was very, very flavorful but the large there is our 
                          medium here.. And the bowl was $7. Wtf.. I know
                          prices have gone up, but how does sink water increase
                          prices?? And the onion oil helps inchance the flavor of
                          Pho. Try it.
#19 Beef Stew/ French bread : Soup was flavorful with nice size beef 
                                                        chunks. Make sure to make a side 
                                                        order for a extra bread. 1 bread is not 
                                                        enough.HA!

That pretty much sums up my past experience there and WOULD highly recommend this spot.

DO NOT GO TO THESE LOCATIONS!!!
Kim Long II- to bland
Little saigon - large is nothing but water and soup was decent
Pho Huong - Brutal , No flavor
Pho Hung - Attention, your pho taste like crap. No flavor"}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas. Wait time was about 20-30  minutes. However, saw a few local viets who were able to \"jump\" the line because they speak vietnamese and were regulars there. Food was amazing"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese place in Vegas.  The food is fresh and good.  The service is very fast, though not always the friendliest.  The prices are reasonable.  I'd recommend a noddle bowl or pho."}
{"text":"If you are not eating here and live on the south end of town then you are cheating yourself out of one of life's best pleasures."}
{"text":"Joseph and I live in PS8's area and forever opted to make the drive to Chinatown instead.  I suggested we try our neighborhood pho joint so we could make a quick trip for dinner or takeaway.  Broth, he says, was pleasingly flavorful and almost as good as Pho Vietnam's {on it's good day}."}
{"text":"We are regulars and never disappointed. My favorite is bun xeo. The crepe is always perfect and the vegetables fresh and plentiful. Not available on busy weekends, i.e. holidays. My partner likes pho."}
{"text":"The phò is so good! The decor and feel of the restaurant was nice too. Servers were friendly. It was a nice experience for my first time here :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing indeed. We eat a lot of phos
all over. Here, the pho was blend, no flavor and pretty mucH MSG-ed out. Herbs were fresh, service fast, clean interior, thumbs up! Would not recommend the pho here."}
{"text":"Rude ass mother fuckers here, if you like being treated like shit then you'll want to come here. Tried asking waitress questions about menu because it had been my first time & she acted like I was wasting her time. As well I ordered an ice tea, & never got it. Then they tried to bill me for that! The food isn't all that great either. I'm very upset with the way I was treated. They all need attitude checks. Litterarly felt like just because I was white they were rude as hell"}
{"text":"I have ALWAYS patronized this establishment, on a regular basis, since I moved to Las Vegas approximately two years ago due to the service and quality of the food.

HOWEVER, my last trip , on June 8th was an EPIC disappointment.  

They had a new server, male, he was totally unattentive.  He NEVER once came by our table to ask if we wanted refills for our drinks, desert or if everything was  OK/

Moreover, he NEVER gave us the BILL!  We had to obtain it from the wonderful female server who has been a staple of the restaurant.

As a result, we just could NOT leave him a tip!  That is something that we hated to do but his attitude was appauling.

In short, they NEED to TRAIN this guy on how to service customers."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Vegas, this is where I eat. The food is delicious. I've gone here about 20-30 times and I've always had a good experience. Service is fast, sometimes you have to flag the waiter down for more napkins or water but hey, they don't mind and I don't expect much from them anyways. I've had almost everything on the menu, I can't say I didn't like anything, except for maybe the banh xeo, it was a little greasy.  They do have the best Vietnamese coffee! This place is packed no matter what time of day it is. Overall, a good place to eat at, it's clean, cute decor, nice sized restaurant."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Pho Saigon 8 from a friend who took me to the one in Chinatown, so I was really excited when this place opened on my side of town. 

I usually get the grilled sliced pork & fried egg rolls over vermicelli and vegetables, and my husband usually gets the grilled lemongrass sliced beef over vermicelli and vegetables or the chicken pho, and we get spring rolls to share. 

Service is good when we dine in, although we usually do take-out more often. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"The pho is just ok, expensive, and the service is very bad.  They are rude, literally throw your food on the table.  Make you pass food from one side of the table to the other side.  Too lazy to walk around.  would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Wow Pho Saigon 8,  I am so disappointed in you guys.  How much cheaper can you get?  You raised your prices from 5.75 for a bowl of pho to now almost 9 dollars... and you still don't have enough to buy noodles and veggies?  This is the cheapest spring roll I have ever eaten!  There are maybe 5 strings of rice noodles in it, and nothing except chopped lettuce.... no other meat except shrimp that has been half cut.  I'm sorry but I have been a regular customer for several years and have seen it get worse and worse...  you have lost a customer.  Everyone,  don't expect quality anymore from this place.  Smh.... I am disappointed... and sad at the same time that quality of food has gone down the drain....."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 was my choice of restaurant every time I visited Las Vegas. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of food and the services at my recent visit. All 4 dishes that each person in our party of four ordered did not meet our expectation. Pho bo was just ok. Banh tam bi and com ga quay were bland. Hu tieu tom cua had very strong smell of seafood."}
{"text":"The service was so ass. Idk how this place keeps loyal customers. We were eating the mediocre pho, nothing special, when the busy boy came and began to take our bowls away. Cleaning the table when we were not done. We sat there and allowed but definitely would not recommend this. Being a pho store owner in LA, I know this is unacceptable. It gave customers, including us, the sense of them kicking us out. Keep in mind that the store was not packed at all. Wouldn't come back, I recommend pho so 1 down the street for excellent pho and family like service."}
{"text":"I love pho and all sorts of soups in general. I usually order the hot soy milk, #14 pho, spring rolls or regular fried egg rolls. It all taste yummy as just like the first original location on Spring mountain in China town. Unfortunately, I'm a shame to same I still constantly come here bcos it is the closest pho restaurant near me (I live in Henderson). They have the worst service. Every time I come here, they either give me water after my food, or they never refill my water. When my family and I order other drinks or smoothies, it takes so long to come out. Like, it comes out after we are done eating and we just take the drinks to go. Also, I always ask for extra lime and sauté. 19 out of 20 times, they forget. Not to mention, these mistakes happen whether it is slow or busy. 

If u want good service, don't come here."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The quality of pho is outstanding here!"}
{"text":"Good Pho and generous portions for the right price. Expect it to be crowded sometimes. It may also be hard to find parking outside."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving bun and our normal place Pho Mai Lan was closed for the evening. So we decided to go for it and give this place a shot.. Well.... It sure was a mistake! We walked in and they asked us how many. We told them two, and they walked us over to a table set down two glasses of water and walked away. Came back a minute later and set down two menus with our napkins on top, then walked away again. After about 5 minutes they come back over and ask us what we wanted. We hadn't decided just yet and we asked for another minute and the reply was, \"Okay, just yell for me when your ready.\" And then she walked away. 
Okay?! By now they've lost any chance at a tip.
So after we decided to get #'s 69 and 70 we looked around and they came over took our order and about 10 minutes later our food came out! It looked good! Well!.... It wasn't. It was a HUGE disappointment! The shrimp on both plates were dry like last weeks left overs that they nuked for a minute and tossed in our dish. Our pork was a little on the burn side and had a funk nasty after taste, but it wasn't terrible enough to not eat... And my roll was fairly uncomfortable to eat. We'd have to say the worst part was the fish sauce. That wasn't to great. 
So while we ate the atmosphere wasn't very inviting. The wait staff was talking on their phones while they were on speaker so we could hear all of their conversation. It was also not very welcoming when they would look at us hoping we would leave. 
All in all everything was terrible except their pricing was pretty fair."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Very attentive my and the food was really good. The Thai tea was an awesome desert! Thanks guys! Keep up the good work on making us have a good experience!

Mr.Paul"}
{"text":"This place is going downhill fast!  I used to come here regularly and get the pho or vermicelli and it was pretty good. Today I took my dad and it was horrible!  
The service has never been good and I didn't think it could get worse, but it has! The table next to me ordered after I did, we ordered the same thing but they got their food before my dad. My dad finally got his food 15 minutes after the table next to us. 

Then I ordered the vermicelli, which came out quick, but I had to sit for 20 minutes until my dad got his food. Then when I actually started eating I noticed most of my lettuce was spoiled! It was turning brown and gray! So disgusting. The only thing I was asked when I brought this to someone's attention was if I wanted new lettuce! Was I really supposed to pick out all of the bad lettuce an eat everything else around it? An then I was still charged for my meal! 

Avoid this place! Go to Pho So 1 down the street. Much better!"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is a pretty typical Vietnamese restaurant. I'm from the 626 area and this place tastes like home. Prices are typical. Pho tastes typical. The servers are nice and helpful.

I asked if they could put my rare beef on a separate plate (bc I like it very rare), but they wouldn't do it bc they said there's \"too little meat to separate.\" 

My family loves the durian smoothie here because they use real, fresh durian. They have filtered water.

Spring rolls are expensive; they're like $5.35 for two rolls. When they came, the rice paper was still a bit wet, which was a great way of telling me that they're fresh, but premade. It's pricy, but I love these spring rolls and the stuff they put in it. The shrimp are a decent size as well!"}
{"text":"Everything was on point!!! Customer service was okay. It hit the spot on this cold Vegas day"}
{"text":"Worst pho place to go to. They don't clean up the tables at all. They leave the dirty dishes on the table until someone comes in. The waiters' attitudes are really bad and talk a lot behind people's back in Vietnamese. The waiters always argue and cuss at each other. Never coming back with the crappy food and service"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but two years ago they started consistently majorly skimping out on the meat for the pho. The eggrolls are delicious, crispy, and one of the best in Vegas though. I saw a waitress in the bathroom and she didn't wash her hands when she left! Service is typical for a pho place."}
{"text":"this place is like part of my house, me and my friend go there almost everyday. it's open early so we go there for breakfast too. 
fast and tasty. Boba is too soft and kinda boiled too much though but Thai tea is good too. we like number 13. what we like about this place is we can choose large or small.
I love here. I love a guy who work at this place he always smiling, nice customer service. he is like a girl, he is so cute. we always put extra tips when he serve us because he makes us happy!"}
{"text":"Recently craving some Pho, I happen to catch Pho Saigon 8 out of the corner of my eye and am I glad I did! 

I first noticed that the business was full, even as people were leaving, it seemed as though all the tables were occupied. The lady who greeted and seated my friend and me was very friendly and welcoming. She had us seated immediately. 

The second thing I noticed was the cleanliness. The tables were quickly wiped clean as people left.  

The menu was extensive and had a good explanation of the various menu items. I chose the beef strip Pho and my friend had the chicken breast Pho. We also had an order of shrimp veggie rolls. All was very tasty and the Pho was plentiful. The beef and the chicken were very tasty, fresh, and juicy. They definitely did not skimp on the amount placed in the bowls. 

I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to my friends and it is definitely going to be my go to when craving Pho!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend coming from California when in this restaurant. We liked the food but horrible service!!!! The owner may put attention in the service .i ll not to invite friends anymore to go there was so embarrassed."}
{"text":"Good authentic Vietnamese food. They get busy so order ahead for pick up. I get the pho dac biet and the pork chop with rice. So yummy! Egg rolls are good too. I come back often and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The most elaborate menu I've ever seen at a Vietnamese joint. 

I opted for the rare beef pho and was not disappointed. The noodle to beef portions was just about right and the broth was delishus. 

The bowl of noodles was a little pricier than I'm use to but not by much."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there today.   This is our second time there... the first experience is good but today, we ordered a large bowl of seafood pho and it came with only 2 tiny shrimps, two pieces of squids and some frozen seafood meatballs that tasted really stale.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service I've ever had. So rude. I can't believe people come here. I was afraid to ask for anything and when I finally did they walked away like they didn't hear me. Never coming back. The food was good but not worth the experience of being treated like that."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California with the wife and kids. Being half thai thought of getting some good food. What a big disappointment this place was. The waitress was rude. The food was mediocre. What a waste of time and money. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Favorite Pho ever!  I love this place!  The iced tea is amazing!  The service was great too!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Order this Bun Bo Hue, soup wasn't as hot! When I added the veggies, the soup got cold!! It was flavorless, all it is SALTY!!!! It didn't come with veggies on the side, we had to ask for it! $9.45 for a small not worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband walked in and was seated immediately, which was pretty fast on a friday during lunch hour and it didn't take them long to take our order. 

My husband usually gets the pho with rare streak only and I like to get the Hu Tieu - dry with the cellophane noodles. So far so good but once we got our food it was a different story. 

Hubby's order was fine but mines came with soup. Not dry BUT with soup! 

So I made a complaint to our waiter (the only older man with glasses) and he said that I DID NOT order dry noodles. And I told him I did, my husband even heard my order. The waiter also said he can not change my order because I \"didn't order it right\". And basically blaming me because I didn't order it right. Ok fine, whatever I'll just eat it so he'll be quiet. I' m not the type to start any confict. I took the first bite and wasn't happy it wasn't the dry version. It tastes totally different and I didn't bother eating it again. 

Just when were about to leave to pay our bill, the waiter comes back and noticed i did not eat it and he offered to change my food. Seriously ? What happen to \"I can't change your order?\" 

Anyways, I wanted to see the manager after this but they supposedly don't have a manager. So I just told the lady who managed our bill what happened and she apologized for his service. She knew who I was complaining about and I didn't even have to point out who it was. She also offered to take my order off the bill and all we had to pay was for my husband's pho. So thank you for that. 

That is why today I gave it 3 stars if it wasn't for the lady upfront who helped us. It'll definitely be awhile before my husband and I come back here."}
{"text":"My girl and I love their Pho. The service can be a little slow at times, but the food is awesome. We're regulars."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pho, but this place really impressed me. Usually, I order the #55, and my boyfriend gets one of the soups. We eat here often."}
{"text":"Perhaps, one of the best Pho places that I have been to. The menu is very big so you have a lot of choices. Whatever Pho you order, they include a lot of meat. The waiters are polite and courteous - they didn't get offended or gave me a blank stare when I asked for a fork.

The place is nicely decorated and crowded., but we didn't have to wait to get a table.  Awesome place to go to if you are in Vegas. It was only about 10min drive from the strip. I'd recommend this place if you really want a quality bowl of Pho in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is good, wouldn't say bad service except nobody seemed to speak English so come knowing what you want."}
{"text":"This place makes some really really good food, but at time the service can be bad. The first time I got here they seated people who came in after us and made us wait for awhile. Drinks aren't so great either, but everything on the menu seems to be really good. 

DO try this place!"}
{"text":"The serving of food is amazing and the customer devices is great, always a great place for lunch or dinner- always leave with a doggie bag"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner, and it was a good, filling meal.  Walked in, got immediately seated (\"Do you have a lonely table for one?  Thank you.\"), and got the menu.  After getting my beverages with a few minutes looking at the menu, I gave my order and started to read the local Filipino (English language) newspaper.  I swear, my hot steaming bowl of pho came out in less than five minutes.  Granted, I know that the ingredients for pho are probably ready (\"mise en place\") to get it out to the customer but it was quick.  Twenty minutes from walking in to walking out?  I know where I need to go if I need to eat with no time on the clock.  And it was good food (item #18, and the broth was a bit saltier than I like).

I didn't get a chance to case the joint, as I was given literally the first table as you walk in.  But, I saw Viet families and some other non-Asian folks enjoying their meals.  Since it is farther away from the Strip, I would assume the clientele is more civilized and respectful (re: not drunk, no loutish behavior).  Will try out the other pho joints, but Pho Saigon 8 is a good Mom and Pop to seriously consider."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pho or Vietnamese food but it was delicious. I got pork broth pho with rice noodles and grilled pork and chicken. I think it was #47. I also had their spring rolls, which were amazing. 

The only problem, one which makes me hesitant to return, was that I ended up sick the next day. Now, admittedly this could be a coincidence; but I can't recommend 5 stars when I ended up sick for 2 days."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. But -2 stars for service and -1 star for their weird prices. 

Food is good. I mean, typical pho and viet food with nothing nasty in it. So 5 stars for that. 

Service...haha get ready. Ordered drinks and food. Our food comes out first so I'm waiting for our drinks. 5 mins go by..nothing. So I asked the waiter (the really fat one) and he gives this irritates look on his face and says \"IT'S COMING!\" well alright jeez. People normally get their drinks before their foods, fatso. ESP with pho...all that MSG, you need a drink with it! The others weren't really any better. We went around 9pm and I guess they were closing soon. Felt like they were trying to rush everyone out. Well hello! You're in Vegas! You expect people to have early dinner times? Whatever. The only reason we tipped is because we had a kid with us and she made a mess with her rice -__-

Their prices are so weird! 6.05 7.05 8.05 dude seriously? You are so stingy you have to do .05. I guess that .05 really helps the owner out but seriously? I've never seen more ridiculous prices. This place is already way more expensive than many other pho places. And having that .05 on the menu just makes em look more stingy."}
{"text":"I ordered PHO #31 with extra meat. Well I got 1 ounze of chicken the same that comes with a standard order. This happened on 2 seperate occassions. Will not be back!!"}
{"text":"The entire menu is numbered. I ordered #43 which was a pork broth bowl with fresh streamed lump crab meat and shrimp which was DELISH. Everything comes out with fresh mint, basil, bean sprouts, limes carrots and jalapeños.  I went a step further and ordered shrimp spring rolls and lettuce wrapped egg rolls to complete my feast. The overall experience was absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place in Vegas.

The Pho is always fresh and flavorful and the meat is tender. They give generous portions and will load you up with extra veggies if you ask. 
Sometimes the servers don't speak the best English but everything is described in the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place. Egg rolls are amazing and my soup is always on point. My favorite place to go out to eat hands down."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Pho 8 I was just getting over a cold (no, I wasn't contagious) and felt the need for a soup. After sampling the wonton bowl, I thought it was the best place on the planet. It was so good that I ended up back a week later, only to discover that while it was still pretty good, their plastic drinking glasses and plastic soup spoons reek of bleach or some other cleansing agent. Nice to know they are sanitized, but I could live without the chemical infusion with my lunch. 

Good soup, clean place, but a little too heavy on the cleansers. I'd still go back, but I think I'll bring my own spoon next time."}
{"text":"I had pho here, I had bun thit nuong cha gio, spring rolls and nem rolls.  The food is edible and didn't make me sick so I'm thankful.  I say, it's just not that special.  If I can make it better, why pay for it?"}
{"text":"All I can say is DELICIOUS! From their Pho, to the fried rice, to their rice plates.  Everything is just delicious.  If you don't believe me, see for yourself."}
{"text":"Best pho in vegas served by the grumpiest and most unfriendly staff you will encounter...if it truely was not great i would have stopped coming here years ago"}
{"text":"All the Pho restaurant here in Vegas is about the same...but the service at the place just makes it bad. The staff is rude...don't greet you...they just seem like they don't want to be there...so why would you? The place is dim/ depressing and dirty. If your a Pho connoisseur and see sauces and gack splatter on the wall you know this place is dirty. It's just un-appetizing.  If they don't care what the dinning area looks like ...just wonder what happens in the kitchen. Not worth giving it a second try."}
{"text":"First off I think the food is good. This is my go-to place when I want to have some pho around the area. My only concern is that the guy named Tran gave a really bad customer service. I mean that guy is not fit to be a server with the kind of attitude that he has. He's just flat out rude. He even rolled his eyes when we asked for straws and to go container. Who does that? With that being said, it just drives the customers away and think not to come back.. Not good for your business."}
{"text":"Food is great. Always come here with the wife. Service is quick and they are always nice."}
{"text":"I've only been once, it was good pho, pretty cheap, and reasonably fast. I wouldn't say it was anything spectacular but worth it if you're in the mood."}
{"text":"Judged by my Vietnamese taste buds, food definitely meets authentic standard.  Service is typical of Vietnamese - civilized but not super friendly...which is fine b/c I'm there for the foods, not to socialize with the waiter/waitress.  Being new to Las Vegas, I had to suffer some very bad Vietnamese restaurants to find this place.  One example is Viet Bistro - their pho broth tasted like artificial pho seasoning diluted in water served in a bowl.  Big mistake serving that to Vietnameses b/c they'd never pay to eat your crappy food twice.  You'd, of course, find many Vietnameses eating at Pho 8...that's a very good sign!"}
{"text":"After wanting a hot bowl of pho, I came across to this place. I got the pho tai, and it honestly was like any other bowl of pho I've had. There wasn't anything special about it, but it was edible. There's a possibility that I would come back."}
{"text":"I am not normally big on Pho, but there are times when one could use a good hot broth. I am staying in Vegas for the winter, and tried the Pho at Pho Huong Saigon on Decatur as it is closest to me. The experience there had me thinking there MUST be better Pho around, particularly as this is Las Vegas's asian strip with many Viet Pho places. 

So I  yelped and found the highly rated Pho Sai Gon 8.

I went there and found it to be crowded for the lunch rush - a good sign I thought. I order the chicken Pho, with both white and dark meat. 

5 minutes later the Pho arrived, packed with meat and noodles. I dug in.

The good:

- Excellent quantity of food. 
- Lotsa flavor.


The not so good

- The broth was oily and the saltiness reeked of MSG. For the first time ever eating Pho, I didnt drink most of the broth.
- The meat was tough and remained so as it sat in the broth.
- The service was perfunctory, with the crowds of people. I left a dollar because someone did come along and refilled my water, otherwise I was left alone.
- The Pho was pricey at 7.50 for a large bowl.

For the first time ever leaving a Pho place, I left unfulfilled and wanting food. I considered going to the cheap and cheerful BBQ King chinese joint behind Pho Saigon 8, but settled for a sardine Bahn Mi at the little bakery in the mall.

With all the choices around on Spring Mountain, I wont be back at Pho Saigon 8."}
{"text":"My friends and I had broth that was sooooo salty. And this was our second time coming here.  The waiter brought out an order wrong and blamed it on my entire group. We were completely baffled as to why this waiter was blaming us.  We just wanted to get the what we ordered. 

Extremely rude service. I rather go down the street to lemon grass.  The waiters are nice and the soup taste cleaner and not pumped up with MSG."}
{"text":"Friend and I were in the mood for pho, and this was close by and the place seemed to have decent reviews, so we gave it a shot. Started off okay, as we promptly got our drink orders taken and had a chance to look over the menu. Looked like a nice extensive menu! The woman taking our food order was different from the man who took our drink order. I was slightly worried because she did not write anything down, and she later had to come back to clarify a part of our order. I also had to repeat my order to her 3x - but perhaps I wasn't speaking clearly enough.

Anyway, food arrived and I added in some jalapenos, basil, and chili sauce which enhanced the soup. However, the well done beef brisket pieces were extremely fatty. So much that I couldn't even eat them. The soup was okay, but not as good as what I get at Lemongrass Cafe. 

Unfortunately after we received our food, no one came by to check on us and it was difficult to flag down someone to get a water refill. Granted, I don't usually have high expectations for service in Asian restaurants, but it sucks when you feel like you're being purposely ignored.

Not planning on ever coming back here. Not much positives to warrant it."}
{"text":"Went here because Lemongrass Cafe was closed for remodeling... that place is our go-to, but my partner and I were really craving pho, so we reluctantly had to settle for another nearby place.

Been here once before, but wasn't much memorable back then. Felt the same way the second time around. We were immediately given menus and water, which was cool. Took a little while for someone to take our order though, but no biggie.

Lots of different meat options for the pho. But felt that the broth itself was almost flavorless. Perhaps because it was a freshly cooked batch and didn't have enough time to steep? Who knows. But the side of herbs of basil, sprouts, lime, and jalapenos were very fresh though.  Spring rolls were also big and plump and a filling appetizer for two people. Just wish it had been cut in half to make it easier to eat.

Service wasn't exactly warm, but adequate. Waters were refilled without having to ask. No one checked in on us at the end though or dropped off a check, so we just paid at the counter. (Not sure what the normal protocol was). 

Fills the craving, but just made us miss our usual Lemongrass Cafe."}
{"text":"Noodle soup gets 5 stars...can't find a better place, good meat portion, fresh sprouts.
Appetizer gets 4 stars...#6 is fantastic, especially the dipping sauce.
Customer service gets 2 star only because they bring the food out...
 
Customer service can use a lot of improvement, especially when the owner's son (the chubby one) is working. The rest of the staff reflects his attitude."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite pho in the area

But recently,  the chicken pho is more like been sprout pho with the essence of chicken

They reduced the amount of noodles and meet SUBSTANTIALLY

Will have to try some other places

The spring rolls are good, though"}
{"text":"Best Pho place in Henderson but they raised their price.  Their bbq meat is very well marinated and delicious.  3 stars for being too expensive and we had to keep asking for water."}
{"text":"The broth wasn't so good. This place isn't what I was expecting. I had better. Never again. For some reason it is hard to find a good pho restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and the amount of meat and food we get, gets smaller and smaller. Not sure what's going on here but the last 3 visits we had were poor. I used to love going here but for the price it is not worth it. I even called to ask them why so much as changed and they didn't understand what I was saying."}
{"text":"**CREDIT CARD FRAUD!***        CREDIT CARD FRAUD!

I am warning you to avoid this place completely.  I.D theft and credit card fraud is on the rise.  Don't let this happen to you.  

Here's what happened.  My good friend paid for the lunch with his credit card.  This was the only transaction for the day on that specific card.  That evening he went to use it for dinner and the card was already shut down.  Come to find out, there were 4 transactions totaling about $800 originating from North Las Vegas while this restaurant is in Henderson (can't be at two places at the same time).  Praise the Lord that the credit card company caught the red flag and canceled his card and the investigation is pending.

I'm so bummed that this happened.  The food is great, the price is not bad and my wife and I were beginning to love  this place!  But in all seriousness and gravity, the good food is not worth the risk of having your identity and credit card stolen.  Be warned and be wise.  I care about all of you, who are reading this, and wouldn't want you to experience such a crime against you.  I implore you to stay away!

Have fun on your quest for good eats!
Sincerely,
Eric F.


p.s the Sunrise Cafe is great... it's on the north side of the same plaza a couple doors down from starbucks."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Our server rushed us, didn't say anything when he dropped off our food, or check up on us. It's the guy with the hair shaved on the sides of his head and drags his feet everywhere he walks. The only guy who was friendly was the only one not in uniform with a white tshirt, and he's the one who refilled our drinks and asked how we were doing. 
Spring rolls were okay, pho was good. I'll still probably be trying out other pho places until I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is my favorite Vietnamese place in Vegas. Although I prefer the West side one on Spring Mountain because it allows a bit easier access with my wheelchair, I am glad that they are now present on the Eastside. A previous Yelper commented that the Lemongrass Cafe across the street is much better, but I have to disagree. Furthmore, the danky carpet in the other place ruins my appetite. Saigon 8 creates the best both for the phos everytime. According to a lot of my Vietnamese friends, it is created fresh every day. The summer rolls are always delicious and their peanut sauce is superb. When I need comfort food this is the place to be. I even feel guilty if I do not order my usual dishes."}
{"text":"Pho never fails at this location. Service is quick and prompt, although not very personable (but I don't set high expectations for that). Once ordered that pork chop with rice dish...it was really good although the portion was a bit small for the price. It was cut pretty thin and they only give you one slice. But other than that, the pho is better than most and it's usually our go to pho spot."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8:
Eastern and 215 Location (Eastern and Pebble)

Let's start with the constructive criticism.  It's smaller places, parking is a little tight otherwise you are parking in the LVAC parking lot.

And most of the servers might have a little trouble speaking English but not all and the owner is usually on-site and very fluent.

Now for the more important stuff, good food, and great price.  I've noticed you seem to get a little more for your buck here than I've seen at other viet restaurants and the food always comes out quick.

Spring mountain location:
Same as above for food, good food for the price, parking is worse though if you go when it's busy but seating is much better and it's larger to accomodate groups. 

Extra info:
I guess the things I'm not crazy about but they aren't unique to either location is if you want to substitute something it's a huge no no, at best you can just have things removed.  And I think the soup only comes in a mainstream size, maybe not quite large but you can't order a small but some dishes come with a small size of Pho minus the meat."}
{"text":"oooh, so far my most favorite vietnamese restaurant in las vegas.  a friend of mine, who just moved here and is vietnamese, also feels that it's one of the better places here in vegas.  the big steaming hot bowls of pho are all good here.  remember when you eat pho, ask for the plate of vinegered onions.  then you smother them with hoisen sauce and the hot chili sriracha sauce.  so, take in some pho to the mouth and then take a fork full of onions.  ooooh yeahhhh.  also, i have to admit i love the wonton soup here.  you gotta order it with egg noodles.  so hearty with lots of wontons.  deelish!!!  it goes so good with those damn onions on the side too.   they do have a wide selection of sinh to (milkshakes)!  they have my favorite durian shake...it does stink, but it taste like vanilla when you drink it down...so when i'm looking for good vietnamese food, i am usually here if i'm not lazy.  i also always refer people to eat here.  so i do really think it's that good."}
{"text":"Overpriced pho!!! 

I mean .. it is in Vegas so I understand but I feel cheated when people have to pay cloce to $10 for pho :(

Food.... \"meh. I've experienced better\" pretty much says it.

Props for being open 24 hours though.

Verdict: 
Never again, I will wait until I get back to LA."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick Pho fix. It was a decent place easy location to find. The inside is clean looking , the tables are too close together. The staff was not the friendliest either.
The food: was okay. The pho was decent but it was missing something the flavor was not there. They had a piece of tendon in there literally bigger then my debit card. We also had the vietnames rice noodles with shrimp and pork. For some reason they gave us that to go. So I believe this took away from the experience of how its to be eaten. The egg roll was not cut instead whole which is not how I've seen this plate served. The flavor was a bit bland the shrimp were over cooked."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The service is quick, the food is cheap and tasty, but both times I ate here it made me sick.  Too bad :("}
{"text":"Great broth taste. Service not awesome but the the Pho soup is great. Good portions on the bowel with lots of meat"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our drive out of Vegas, and it was a great surprise. I ordered the pork and egg roll with noodles, and loved it. The price was great, too. Family of four ate for less than $30 - a steal in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is an ok place if you need a pho fix. Bill came to $26 for 2 bowls of pho and spring rolls. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean and service is great. Been coming here for years for pho.  I recommend the combo large pho. Packed with a lot of meat and noodle makes it tough to finish."}
{"text":"I am an absolute fan of vietnamese food and have eaten at many restaurants.  This one definitely stands out from the others and I know there are a lot of vietnamese restaurants to choose from in that area.  When my family traveled to Las Vegas, we actually dined here twice because we were pleased to find such a great restaurant the first time.

The broth is what I consider the most important part of a good bowl of noddle soup.  The beef AND seafood broth were both spectacular and delicious.  I like the atmosphere and the quality of the pieces of meat. Only bad thing is the price.  I do not like how there are other restaurants just down the street for a more affordable price for a little less  in expectations.  That knocks it down one star.  The restroom is a bit dirty but its nothing extreme.  You should go try it out!"}
{"text":"Love this location! I don't have to go far to get the best pho in town.  The decor was contemporary, also there are 4 televisions.  The staffs and services were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is on Rainbow just south of 215. If that brings up visions of terrible traffic, you're not alone. If you're coming from the 215 exit, you can sit there several minutes waiting to make the left into the parking lot.

The defining feature of this place, really, is that it's open till 11pm some nights, midnight other nights. So, if it's after about 9:30, this is a great option for some really decent pho. And you don't have to worry about traffic at that hour.

Most of what they make here, while very good, isn't quite as good as some of the other nearby places--but not enough to matter when you're craving some lovely pho. One standout is the chicken pho, which is excellent, and they even let you choose white or dark meat (dark, of course). If you're one of those weird people for whom the normal bowl of pho is too much, they offer a small size.

Service can be spotty. Order by number, as some of the servers don't speak English very well. Don't bother waiting for your check when you're done, just go up to the register and if it's crowded, take note of your table number.

Great option for 11pm takeout."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good, i gave this restaurant only 2 stars because i was really disappointed with the service. We weren't greeted when we came in which i didnt think it was a big deal but once we were seated, the server rushed us in ordering and took off before we even finished ordering. No one came to check up on us if we were doing ok until the very end when we were already pretty unsatisfied with the service. Again the food was pretty good but i would like to see the service improve."}
{"text":"I am constantly trying to find something that is closer to Henderson thank Pho Kim Long to satisfy my craving for Pho. This place did it for me. Thank god. Pho was great! Fresh, satisfying, and service was good. Even when we order to go, everything is packaged properly and ready fast. Happy Customer and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Amazing and crave-worthy... wanna blow their minds? Be caucasian and order #8... you're welcome."}
{"text":"It's super fast, friendly, and yummy! I had a large pho with rare meat and it was great. Lots of meat compared to other places. I also really enjoyed the soda chan, a lime and club soda mix. Really refreshing in the Vegas heat."}
{"text":"Not the best Pho place at all! I definitely would choose one in China town before this. But the food is decent, so if you don't want to deal with long lines or traffic it's okay. But personally I would rather deal with that and get great Pho at Pho Kim Long. This place also is not clean or nice at all! Pho Kim Longs IS the BEST Pho in town. Trust me, your mind will be blown if you think this place is & then go to Pho Kim Long."}
{"text":"I guess I made a wrong choice today. 

If you can't make the food right, then shouldnt you only focus on what you are good at? Dont make a menu with 100 of choices and none of them taste good. (We ordered 5 differents food on the menu and all of them have weird taste)
The service are amazingly awful. No greeting, no smiling, no customer interaction, Nothing. 
I paid not only for the food but also the service. If your foods aren't good enough. Make it up by the service."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now but it's my first time reviewing it. If you're on a time crunch this place is great. I often come here for lunch. The price is unbelievably affordable and you get great tasting food. The service is average, they're very quick. You're able to order and get your food very quickly. We ordered spring rolls for appetizer, that's a must. Healthy, refreshing and yummy. I had the Combination Crispy Chow Fun, it was edible. I will not be ordering this dish here because they have so many dishes that taste better. My sister in law order the crepe, yummy yummy. The Pho is magnificent here, once you try it you'll be addicted. If you like coffee you must order their ice French roasted coffee with condensed milk, there's nothing like it in this world. If I have to pick one cuisine to eat for the rest of my life it'll definitely be Vietnamese. You'll love this place."}
{"text":"Ordered take out over the phone... The girl taking my order was a bit sassy! When I arrived at restaurant she was sitting at cashier station... She did NOT greet me when I walked in! She told me the total, I handed her my credit card... then she asked \"if I happened to have cash\"!  WTF!!??? If I had cash don't you think I would have given cash??!! Duh!! Well at least she thanked me as I was leaving. 

Food was good so that's why I gave 3 stars! Too bad cashier was sassy & not friendly!!"}
{"text":"Ordered myself a bun bo hue, it was bomb!   Reminded me of San Jose or Oakland.  Love the fact that I can go to a good Pho restaurant in Vegas.  It is the best hangover cure.  their service is ok but their food is on point.  I would definitely be here on every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Yummm!  The best pho I've tried in Vegas.  The broth is very flavorful and not too salty.  I drive from summerlin all the way to Spring Mt and decatur for the comfort of a bowl of noodle and broth with beef!  

Clean restaurant and always a seat waiting.  The staff is helpful enough, but even if they sucked I'd come for the rockin' pho!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I eat there 3 times a week. The food is much better than Lemongrass, the broth for Pho is better too. Only complaint I have is the servers don't fill your water often enough, you have to ask sometimes."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho!  

At a recommendation of a friend, we hit this place up. We rolled into Vegas and checked in to our hotel then we opted to eat off the strip. Besides you will save more money eating off the strip.  The place was very clean and staff friendly.  No long waits at dinner time and our food was served immediately.  We ordered the Pho with steak and Bun Tom Thit Nuong (grilled shrimp and grilled steak with Vermicelli noodles).  For starters we ordered some fried Spring Rolls.  Very good!  Overall the food was very good.

The restaurant was twice as big as any Vietnamese Pho place we have ever been.  Very clean and staff friendly.  Fast service but a little overpriced.  For instance 4 spring rolls for $5.95, in California you get 6 for that price.  A larger size bowl of Pho was priced at almost $7.95, a dollar more than Cali.  

Food   =    B
Staff     =   B+
Decor  =   B+"}
{"text":"I do not know about this place being the best but it sure does get really close to it. The food is very good. I had the beef stew with egg noodles and it had lots of flavor and it was seasoned very well. I cannot believe I finished a large bowl. The pho was one of the best I had in town. I did not get any rice dishes but it looked really appetizing. They do not mess around when it comes to service. As soon as you walk in the door the wait staff is all over you. I highly suggest dining at this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab my quick fix of Pho prior to attending a concert with my family, the food was fairly decent. I ordered the Pho Tai Chin Gan. It came with probably too much noodles and meat for me to finish, but it was okay. I'm not too much of a big fan of eating Pho with barely any soup and just a TON of the noodles so probably that's why I can't give it the full 5 stars. The service there was pretty good, the staff was quick and friendly so that's a plus. Would recommend if you don't have anything or anywhere else you need to go to."}
{"text":"Of all the Pho places I've been to in Chicago, Atlanta, and the Bay Area, this place had the best broth I had. It tasted SUPER clean and the thinly sliced beef they give is just rare enough that it's edible but not too chewy. Their prices are right on par (about $8 for a bowl of large pho) and they give lots of sprouts.

They are super quick which they should be. It indicates the broth is already made and they do a wonderful job even at 9 AM in the morning!"}
{"text":"First off the service is questionable , kinda abrasive the way they are and didn't feel like the cleanest place. But the broth is good , very. However I highly recommend agents going during holidays or long weekends. They have a special menu that's very small and they get super stingy with everything. Other than that I think the place is cool at least the broth is good..."}
{"text":"Good pho with fast service! The spring rolls are amazing! Place is really clean"}
{"text":"Pho noodles are good, but after eating here, i am always so thirsty. I suspect the msg in the soup.  Service is fast though and the rice noodle plates are tasty."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of of pho in my life, and I can honestly say that this was the best I've had. I don't know if it was the delicious broth, the noodles, or the chunks of beef tendon - that are optional for those who prefer not to eat cow innards - but overall it was just a great pho. The vietnamese coffee went great with the noodles, and the fried egg rolls and meatball kabob were great appetizers. They also offer so many different types of pho it's CRAZY, so make sure to try lots! (especially number 18)

And I guess I might be stickler, but the customer service left a little to be desired. However, the food was amazing and I did eventually find the waiter to pay the bill."}

{"text":"Overall it's a decent pho restaurant in Henderson. The staff is quick and pretty accommodating to certain requests. I believe they do automatically add gratuity of parties 6 or more,  which is fine... In the past, I have ordered pho, hu tieu, bánh canh, egg rolls, and bun bo hue...This is a variety that I normally don't order at other pho restaurants. Typically I just order pho with rare steak, tripe and tendon (which is pretty ok here)...so this just means Im giving this place a chance to outshine the typically mentality I have of pho restaurants. And gladly I did!! Yes, I would come back to try other dishes on their menu...."}
{"text":"I just live down the street so I thought I'd check this place out since it's fairly new. I thought the service was great. I was served quickly and was checked on several times throughout my meal. The staff was friendly and the food was yummy. I ordered a small Pho Tai Nam Gau and had more than enough food, the beef was cooked perfectly. Price was competitive with other Vietnamese places. I walked out full and satisfied. Will return again."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Pho Saigon 8 has two other locations that have been open for many years. This location is their newest one and does not meet the quality of the others. The Eastern and 215 location is the best.

FOOD: We tried serval different dishes and sadly is was not good at all. Everything was bland and overcooked, from the meat to the noodles to the soup. The most decent dish was the spring rolls.

DRINK: They sell Vietnamese dessert drinks, sodas, beers, and wine. I didn't want to get any drinks considering how bad the food was.

SERVICE: They are extremely unstaffed. They have one cashier, one waiter, one server, and one bus boy. It took forever for someone to seat us and even longer for someone to come take our order. They came and took our order three times and yet our food still did not come out. As I looked around the restaurant, I could tell that the other customers were annoyed as well. The server and the cooks kept arguing with each other and it quickly became awkward (especially since I speak Vietnamese and can understand what they are saying). They did not bring us drinks, utensils, or anything unless we asked. When it was time to pay, the cashier was no where to be found as many tables were waiting to pay, it turned out he was doing something outside the restaurant and the server had to go get him.

NOTE: I rarely give this low of a rating and review, but I am so disappointed with their food and service."}
{"text":"I've been to many pho places looking for the best pho and this one is probably one of the ones I would recommend to anyone. Aside from the pho, the food is great. The Barbecue plates and dishes are my favorite and it keeps me coming back for more. Love this place. It's clean and the service is great."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering take-out from a Pho restaurant, so it was a bit confusing. I would only recommend they explain, or have on their site, or even have a sign explaining why it is served the way it's served.  The #11 was very good."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly employees. Food was delicious and served quickly, even with a full house!"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is definitely our favorite Pho place off Eastern near the 215, but I know there has to be better out there. The broth is just OK, not salty/flavorful enough in my opinion. The amount of meat they put in each serving varies from visit to visit. The french bread is good, not great. Sometimes it seems extremely fresh and flaky, other times it seems old.
Service is fast which should be standard at a pho place. Waiters are generally nice and quick to give refills or additional items. Overall, this is better than a few other Vegas places but I've definitely had better pho in other cities."}
{"text":"the pho and soup is delicious, the place is nice and average size, the pho I always order is perfect, the soup tastes good, the noodles are the best part and the employees are very nice and quiet"}
{"text":"UPDATE June 2014
I am obsessed with the pho from here. I order the spring rolls and number 26 Pho. Love, love, love it!

Decided to try some where new since every single place seems to disappoint me over time.  Decided to finally try here since it is in the top 10 with Yelp.  Nice, clean restaurant, a little small but they make it work, and it has working AC! Something Pho So 1 was lacking.  I ordered the Large #26 which has tendon, tripe, brisket? I can't remember perfectly but it is my go to set of meats in my pho.  The pho was good. Tasty and not too salty.  My only complaint is that the pho needs more noodles, a little more meat and more jalepenos to put in it.  I did read someone's else review that said she usually orders 2 larges and I should of.  A large just has more soup? Does that make sense? I felt like I was not full but hungry.  I could have eaten another bowl definitely.  The spring rolls were great also.  I would definitely good again and get more food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pho thai. Staff is very friendly and serves quickly. Take out available and is packaged nicely."}
{"text":"I would have to say one of the best places to get Pho. I get the #11 mostly.  It's soo yummy. I would have to say the service isn't the best, but the last couple of times I have been here its getting better."}
{"text":"Service is always quick and I have never waited to be seated. The food is always delicious-- I rarely have complaints. I've been to the other top rated pho places (Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long) many times but Pho Saigon 8 is ultimately my favorite. The spring rolls have a good texture and taste fresh... I often find that at other places they get hard quickly and it just isn't the same! The egg rolls here are also very good-- they come super hot with lettuce you can wrap them in. The pho/soup comes out very fast... I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my meal! The waiters aren't very sociable, but they get you what you want/need. This place might be faster than fast food."}
{"text":"Out of all the Pho spots in the Southwest area, Rainbow/215, I'd choose Pho Saigon 8 rather than Jenni Pho or Pho Annie. 

Main reasons is their fast and friendly customer service. The prices are reasonable. We've been here multiple times and they are prompt with serving water(s) while you take a look at what you want to order. Never have we felt rushed or impatiently waiting for service. The restaurant is large enough to cater to large groups. They have a couple big screen TV's around with the sports channel on. Go Knights Go! 

My usual order is No. 11 (noodle with rare eye round) in a small. Broth is good. Can't forget to add Hoisin sauce and  Siracha chili to give it some kick. The egg rolls are always a must. 

No cash? Don't fret! They accept cards here. Not like another pho place I know, that was cash only (no bueno)."}
{"text":"Pretty good. They give a lot of meat with the Pho, which is rare in my opinion but always appreciated."}
{"text":"Waited in line. They seated a couple that came after us. Even though my wife reminded him that we were next. The waiter acknowledged we were next and still took the next person in line. That's bs. And it doesn't make sense he put them on a 4 seat table when 2 seat table was available. He then acknowledged he made a mistake and wanted us to wait another 5 mins. 

We eat here twice a month not anymore. There is a lot of places we can spend my money. 

Next stop lemongrass cafe 3 mins away.
Our family's new spot for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"It was mediocre . Pho was like warm not the broth Iv had if u absolutely need pho and every pho place is mysteriously closed I mean I guess u could come here 

I also ordered vegan print rolls . GROSS the tofu was fried but has a weird pungent taste 

14.26$ was my total for pho and veggie spring rolls def. not coming back 

Maybe they still need to tweak some of thier recipes ."}
{"text":"We always come here for Vietnamese food, Pho is good , Pork Chop with rice and Crepe are so good !!!
We bring  our friends here and they love it as well.
Friendly Service !!"}
{"text":"I asked two different employees & they told me that they do use msg!!!  their food taste fantastic but be aware if you do not want msg."}
{"text":"My husband ordered over the phone for pick up, a pho combination. Usually they would come with meatballs right??? Not at all! And that's his favorite part of it. And then only 1 piece of tendon.. really??? Never again!"}
{"text":"Looking at it as food only it was great. As a whole I felt like they didn't want my business. Maybe next time I will show up with an Asian friend. But yes the food was great."}
{"text":"Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Been there once... and that's okay for me."}
{"text":"The foods are the best, good service and excellent! Thumbs up.. I hope the have branch at Sacramento."}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week! Love, love, love the crispy egg rolls - you absolutely MUST have these when you visit. The soup is always on point and I now know the staff and vice versa...Hahaha! Love this place!"}
{"text":"After coming to this place for almost a year bringing friends and family to try what I discovered to be the best ph? Las Vegas had to offer! I was very disappointed to find that there portion sizes have been cut down. #31 white chicken breast lacked the quality egg noodle I substituted for rice noodle the broth was much more oily then before and what happened to the chicken??? Fresh spring rolls lost there fat and full zest and the service seems to have no care there guest get thirsty. I much prefer this place over any other ph? restaurant as I would drive 30 minutes just to eat at this place. I have tested this place out numerous times before writing this review and sad to say this place has no longer captured my bu$ine$$"}
{"text":"Love this place forever it's been one of my favorite spots for a while! Great broth and amount of meat per bowl...beef tendons are also a plus whenever I'm in the mood :-)"}
{"text":"As a first timer here, the pho tai was absolutely delicious. Everything was pretty spot on from the customer service, to the presentation, to the meal. Hopefully this isn't just because of their grand opening. Definitely think this pho restaurant will be a hot spot as long as they continue doing exactly what they're doing."}
{"text":"What a find!  We had the Beef Pho and egg rolls.  The broth for the Pho was really, really nice.  It was subtle and didn't punch you in the face with flavor.  I really like the delicateness of the broth as opposed to strongly flavored broths.  Super clean compared to most Pho places I've been which is a plus."}
{"text":"Pho was very mediocre - came out warm and not hot."}
{"text":"I tried two other Pho places in the area, and this one serves the best broth. The other ones are just not as flavorful. Lots of seating and service was fine. I did notice that the older female waitress appeared colder than her younger counterparts but she treated us well and thanked us for coming when we left. So maybe she's not the warmest person in the world, but we rolled with it and didn't seem to have a problem. It's worth it for the pho. Until I find a better place in this area of Las Vegas, Pho Saigon 8 has my business."}
{"text":"So i finally tried this place after getting some clarification on the ingredients of the broth.  The owner was very prompt and answering my questions. My main concern is that there were no animal products in the veggie broth. I am happy to report having tried it I did not detect any animal products in it. Additionally has now become my favorite place for pho as the place I had previously been going to the Brass was overly salty. They have a very mild broth with good flavor, and are extremely generous with the fresh veggies and condiments. Very important to note for those of you who are vegan you must request the veggie broth.#vegan"}
{"text":"Food is priced well and tastes fresh. Staff waits to be told to do things rather than being proactive. For example: clearing plates bringing menus and refilling drinks. They are friendly and efficient otherwise."}
{"text":"Its alright. Quality of food is good. Taste is rather bland. Pho is a bit on the oily side."}
{"text":"The pho served here is quick and tasty. It satisfies the nightly pho cravings and is a good place for those who live in the Henderson area, as it nearby. But there are better pho places in Vegas, if you are willing to drive."}
{"text":"First time to this place and was impressed. Super fast service and food was amazing can't wait to eat hear again."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very different from other Vietnamese restaurants, with the soup and noodles tasted pretty ordinary. The spring rolls were pretty good, but still, ordinary.
  The waiters seemed like all they wanted to do was rush me out the door as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Yay! Authentic Vietnamese Pho. Good size portions, not too greasy or salty. Clean restaurant.  Very little wait. Good servers."}
{"text":"Hey this place is alright. I mean, I liked my pho and my husband's pho. The place was filled with Asians which is always a great sign, and the bathrooms were very well cleaned. However, the spring roll looked pretty but smelled like someone rolled it after wiping their hands on a moldy towel. The service was indifferent, the waitress could have cared less to help us or to even get us the check. Would I go back? Probably, if it was the only game in town, but it is not...."}
{"text":"Craving pho like crazy, glad I found this spot semi close to the crib past 9pm. Me and my man both ordered vegetarian bowls and they are  Hard to find good pho places that have vegetable broth too."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 - was our first taste of Pho in Las Vegas since the move from NYC.  I love Pho!  There's just something about a nice big bowl of Pho thats just so comforting!  Born and raised in NYC's Chinatown I definitely know my Pho.  My gf is Vietnamese and from Boston where the Pho is even better than in NY.  Pho is all about the broth.  I, for one, love my soup dark, beefy, and with a little bit of oil from the bones of the beef.  Pho Saigon 8 has a much lighter broth in color and taste.  It does however, give it a more refreshing and cleaner tasting broth.  *If your broth tastes like its missing something, add some Fish Sauce (Nuoc Mum), but be warned, a little goes a long way!) The deep fried egg rolls/spring rolls were ok as were the summer rolls.  I like mine made with the white rice paper instead of the generic yellow eggroll paper.  It has little air bubbles popped on the skin that gives the eggroll/spring roll some added crunch and texture.  The summer rolls looked fresh and tasted good with the peanut sauce. The limeade soda (Soda Chanh) is good.  Many locals have prasied this place and I can see why.  Not a bad spot to get some Pho."}
{"text":"I love the food here everything is really tasty and the price is pretty good. They make your food really fast I don't have to wait long. Sometimes I order Togo and they take like only 10 minutes to prepare my food."}
{"text":"went at 2:45pm and it was packed! pho was good and authentic. bf had the grilled chicken with rice, and it was also very good. service was \"basic vietnamese\" (not overly helpful or attentive, but prompt). pro: good parking, next to pure foot massage."}
{"text":"Very Good choose #18 or #23 if you like beef.  Service is just as good.  and they watch the amount of salt on their soups if you have Blood pressure problems.  Recommend to all my friends to GO!  Enjoy one of the best Pho places in las vegas."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite lunch place.  I love the soup - no matter what I have, it's always good!  It's a great comfort food, especially when the weather gets cold or rainy or if I'm feeling under the weather.  I start everything with an order of spring rolls, best shared with a friend.  So fresh!  Then order whatever soup that fancies me that day.  Make sure to order a SMALL because the LARGE is enough to share!  If I have room after eating all of that, I love to get a hot vietnamese coffee with that yummy cream.   So good!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the Pho was really great but the service left so much to be desired that we will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Came to eat with some people. While visiting Las Vegas 
And this place was pretty much dead when we walked in 
But the food was alright.."}
{"text":"It was especially cold this past weekend in Vegas so the Pho tasted extra delicious. Good quality Pho with fresh ingredients and a great tasting soup! I would definitely stop by again when I come back to the city of sin."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever had pho, I had number 46 with egg noddles. It was so good!! I ordered to go and service was fast and friendly. Would come back again soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent Pho at a place that's consistent this is the place for you. I Always get the white chicken Pho with spring rolls or the fried rolls. I'm sure they use MSG, but haven't found a place yet that doesn't. Good overall and close to the strip for you tourists."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the only thing that bothered me and really caught my attention was their rest room doors are widely open and you can smell it when you are sitting on a table close to the restrooms. I wish they will make ways to just close it."}
{"text":"I usually get one of their Pho noodle bowls.  I like the beef brisket, tendon, and also the beef stew noodles.  Meat is always very tender and soup is very flavorful.  I also like the spring rolls with the lettuce and cilantro wrap.  Sevice is a bit lacking, after the food arrives the next time they see you is payment on the check.  Last week went in and notice the prices have gone up across the board.  I guess a business can do that if they are busy all the time."}
{"text":"-15% surcharged for 6 or more

-Pho is not hot enough - frankly it is too cold for calling it Pho

-The mom/daughter served on weekday and they never smiled event when they took our orders/payment (ie: if you are in this business, you need to smile or loose customers)

-RECOMMEND: DO NOT EAT HERE go to KUNG FU (Thai Chinese on the same street near Chinatown - food over there much better)"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I love this place. If the GF would let me I would eat here almost every day. The food is excellent, I have not even tried something I didn't love. The spring rolls are really .. really... really good. Amazing and fresh taste that wrecks the experience at any other place in Vegas. Now the Pho is excellent and no matter what one I am in the mood for they deliver. Service is fantastic most of the time however most staffers are a little light on English so you can be challenged to communicate some things. 

If only they had VN Sandwiches it would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Drive, drive, and keep on driving pass the usual pho spots on Spring Mountain Road and you will come to Pho Saigon 8 on the corner of Westwind Road. What I like about Pho Saigon 8 is that the broth alone can be drank as a soup, and that is why I am giving them 4/5 stars.

For me, it's all about the soup. When I took a sip of the broth, I absolutely fell in love with it. I did not need to add anything to it, it was not watered down, not too overly oily, not too salty. A definite perfect balance that makes you devour the bowl within minutes of being served.

While cost is a bit higher then usual $7-$8 a bowl (small), I absolutely think it's worth it to cure your hang over or just as a meal! As it stands, this is the spot to be now for pho after a hard night in Vegas."}
{"text":"We always have super fast and great service! The pho is amazing! As well as the chicken. This is the type of restaurant where they sit you down, take your order serve you and that's it. Some people like when they come back a lot of times, but I hate that. 
The number 11 pho is my favorite. It doesn't have too much to it, just one type of meat. 
All in all, I think it's great!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from LA and I wasn't sure where to go eat and I found this place and the food was delicious. In LA we have tons of these restaurants everywhere. Here I only found a few and I have to say I ate at two different places and this one is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch here today since it has been so long since my last visit.

I ordered my usual:

Pho Tai w/tripe and the beef on the side (small) $6.85
Soda Chanh (fresh lemon soda) $2.75

The small is a little too small. The broth was a little on the salty side. The beef looked good, but I think the slices should be smaller. The soup is not hot enough. I don't put all my beef in the soup right away. After about 5 minutes, the beef I was adding to my bowl was not cooking. The fresh lemon soda was good."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 Stars because of the price of the bowl. I was there last Friday with 3 friends and we all ordered Pho. I ordered the #21 large with extra meatballs. It cost me $11.00. That's about $3-4 more than the other pho restaurants in Chinatown and it's much better in Chinatown. Okay, it was in Henderson but make it competitive. The meatball suck. It wasn't even good. 2 balls cut in half for $2.00 more? Wasn't worth the extra. They should have a combination bowl with everything in it. The broth was very good, egg rolls were good, and the spring rolls were good. I won't go back. I'm disappointed because they only had holson sauce, Sarachia sauce and a red chili sauce."}
{"text":"One of the worst 10 Vietnam Restaurant I have been to so far. The service here is terrible.  NOT COMING BACK. Gave this place 2 chances."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The Pho isn't bad, however I've had better. I was disappointed in that I couldn't order the combination of meats I prefer like most pho places. Like most of these restaurants they do not give military or student discounts."}
{"text":"I want to first say that I really like the food here, but the service is less than mediocre.  And I know this isn't Joel Robuchon at the MGM, where the bussers scrape your bread crumbs off the table with a special bread crumb brush. But for heaven sakes, you are in the hospitality industry as well! I really don't feel their hospitality here! At least ask me if I would like some water? And even when you do ask me if I want water, it is as if you are angry for me coming into the place and having to actually make you work for your dollar! Or why do I have to flag you down whenever I need something? 

As far as food, the spring rolls were decent, but nothing to honestly to rave about. The pho was not memorable, but I have had so much pho, maybe I don't know a good one anymore?  They have no sandwiches also .

The décor is maybe the best thing that they have going for them, and location.  I really dislike their tables though. I am 5'1 and very small, and I still think their tables are small! The problem is that the tables have this poorly placed bar under them where my husband kept pushing my legs.  Each table is so closely placed. I can almost hear every conversation around me. Not much of a place for a first date. 

I love pho, but if there is another pho place at least a mile away from this one... I would choose the other, cause this place can really piss me off. They can be just darn rude here."}
{"text":"Food was good, but halfway through the meal we saw roaches on the walls and floor.  That part was not so good."}
{"text":"They have amazing flan with great texture. I tried the Thai tea. Real good and rich. Also, they have good bread. I think it's like a French bread roll for dipping into the soup."}
{"text":"Beware! If you're a darker skinned person or do not fit the culture they will discriminate against you.  Waited 20 minutes fir pho that takes a few minutes to prep.  Went with my best friend and we're never going back.  I thought that we were beyond that. ...smh"}
{"text":"Was in there yesterday with the family. Pho was delicious, pricing was good, service was quick but very pushy I felt rushed out place was empty but they were in a hurry to get us out.  We all felt pushed out, weird."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with LiLy D to grab a quick bite. 

We were in a rush so I just got pho tai. The waiter doesn't come by to check to see if I'm ready to order. He doesn't come by to check to see how everything is. They charge $1.50 for tea...wtf?

Thanks for picking up the check LiLy!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few days ago as it was really cold and we all wanted something warm/hot after a day of helping a friend move. This was something nearby and we all agreed. 

We were immediately sat at a table when we arrived and had gotten waters. 

2 of us gotten #21 large (Noodle w/ rare eye of round, flank, brisket, tendon, and skirt flank). 1 had gotten the #11 small (Noodle with rare eye of round). Another had gotten #15 small (Noodle with rare eye of round and beef ball). One of my friends had gotten the sausage/pork roll (i believe was #5) as he had other dinner plans (which got we later found out next day that they were canceled.... Lol) 

As with all pho noodle soups, it comes with a plate with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, and wedges of lime. 

Reason why i got #21 is that it is most similar to what is called \"Combination Pho or Pho Dac Biet\" in a lot of other restaurants, which is essentially the one with everything. The only thing that this didn't have that some others may have is either tripe or beef balls. Average sized large bowl. Good amount of meat and noodles. Add herbs and bean sprouts to the bottom under the noodles, squeeze some limes and you gots a good bowl of pho. Oh a side dish of hoisin and sriracha too for dipping meat. I don't know if it was because i was super hungry and barely had food, or was cold cuz of weather, but this hit the spot, even if it didnt last that long (got hungry later at night.. haha)

The restaurant is mildly small and could get busy due to limited seats but its a fairly decent size. Prices seem mildly higher than those in Chinatown but for convenience if you are in the area, the price difference is very negligible. 

They are willing to split the bill without restrictions which was good. Not really much complaints besides some unreasonable ones (like not enough meat, not enough noodles.. should have ordered some egg rolls (cha gio) too ! but wait werent they considerably more pricey than other places...?) lol... .right? unreasonable.. hahaha !"}
{"text":"So yummmmmmmyyy! We were looking for a pho place and one of the workers at our hotel recommended this pho spot. I would totally come back. We came here around 2 and there were a good amount of people, no wait though, considering pho is really fast in preparation. I got the com tam and everyone else got their pho, and it was so good. I can really compare this pho place to back home in cali! The soup was amazing in taste, not too salty and not too bland. 

Thanks, will come back!"}
{"text":"Good pho. I save a trip going to Spring Mountain when I was living in Silverado Ranch area."}
{"text":"One Tuesday morning, I had the misfortune of checking this place out. this is my first yelp review ever, and  ive had Yelp for over 2 years now, I just didn't have the time to review all the restaurant I eat in ,and frankly I didn't see the point of it,  it's always gonna be inconsistent when it comes to restaurants-- you simply cannot please everyone. 
Anyways I just can't move past what I've experienced in this place. The service was mediocre we ordered two pho bo vien, avocado smoothies and spring egg rolls. I'm not writing this review to comment about the ambience of the place or the sodium levels of the food, I'm commenting about the nasty cockroach that I found crawling on our food!!! Yep, that's right a big brown cockroach! I would have snapped a picture but I was so disgusted and busy spitting out my food and the waitress took the food right away. We got up so fast... Eager to leave. The waitress kept apologizing but I just can't bring myself to say ' it's okay' because it's not! It simply is not OK to serve paying customers cockroach infested food needless to say I'm disappointed and disgusted, prolly scarred for life too! 
Go get yourselves an exterminator!!!"}
{"text":"One of the cooks went into the bathroom. And while I was washing my hand; the cook had gotten done doing her business. And I was expecting her to wash her hands. But no, this bishhh ended up leaving the bathroom with her unwashed hands. I also notice a few servers do the same. I am calling the Health Department soon!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and kept thinking the pho broth would be better...it would come out warm but not hot like it should be. Hopefully it'll improve in the future!"}
{"text":"The rare eye of round beef pho is the best I've had anywhere. It really is what makes the not-so-friendly, barely-there service tolerable."}
{"text":"Very good. I have been here at least 1 time my last 3 times in Vegas and the food is consistently good in all 3 locations. Portions are large and service is quick."}
{"text":"I had lunch here two times in two days, beginning 12/23/15.  The food was good, service was very good and attentive and the restaurant appears clean.  It's packed with families who love good Vietnamese food.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"The old lady w/curly hair took our orders. Needless to say she's extremely rude af! Answering w/a very quick and short one to word answer. We asked for more napkins and she just literally threw them on the table all the while we hand our hand out waiting for her to hand m them over (guess someone loss big time last night?!) Besides that food was pretty decent. Better that that Pho Kim Long that we've been eating at (due to closer location.) we've been here a couple other times but it was such a long time ago that we didn't need to write a review cuz it was pretty decent service. But today was just an awful experience all around!"}
{"text":"They are quick! Always quick to get your order to you and quick to refill drinks. Love that the food here doesn't make you feel heavy and actually tastes healthy without skimping on flavor. Only drawback is some tables are conjoined to other patrons which can be slightly awkward. Nevertheless great place for pho!"}
{"text":"I think everyone understands when I say: Everyone needs a good bowl of pho in their life. Luckily for Las Vegas go-ers and locals, Pho Saigon 8 is the place to get that bowl! With a murky broth, the pho is simply tasty! Add hoison sauce, sriracha, lime, and a ton of bean sprouts and you're pho bowl is set for success. 

The service is good (OMG. People actually speak engrish here!), the place is clean (OMFG. I can drink the water?!), and the food is good! (AS IT SHOULD BE!) Pho Saigon 8 continues to impress me on my visits to Vegas and it's nice breather (away from the cigarette smoke) from the strip.

Although... parking is a BITCH! as it always is!"}
{"text":"Noodle soup has a great broth. Not a fan of some of the fatty cuts of meat though. Overall this was good and I will definitely come back... I'll just choose a different meat than the Flank and Round combo (#13)."}
{"text":"so I got this place mixed up with Pho Little Saigon. I did originally rant a rave about how great this place was but it was not the right place. my bad, sorry for the confusion. However, I did have the pleasure of stopping into this establishment after my work out at the las vegas athletic club (same parking lot). I ordered the seafood pho and this place does it a bit different with the items of meat in the pho. They give you tiny eggs so i'm wondering if its maybe quail eggs? I don't know if they do this in all their pho dishes or if it is just in the seafood one, but one of the eggs seems to be a bit off so I don't know if it was bad or what. The broth is strangely sour if you taste it on its own.  its a clear yellow color which is not beef broth like its supposed to be. After adding all veggies, noodles, and meat it does take some of the sourness away but the broth is not authentic. Its lacking in the proper pho spices/flavor. it really was just a sour/salty broth. definitely not a traditional authentic Pho broth at all. in my opinion you are much better off going to the Pho Little Saigon in the chuck e cheese/99 cent store/in and out parking lot on the other side of the 2-15 to get the real deal, you will be much happier. Its where I always go when I am to lazy to make my own traditional Vietnamese food at home. Don't even waste your time at Pho Mai lan, its a rip off very expensive for what you get and its not authentic either, their beef broth is literally beef broth with no Pho spice flavor. $10 for a bowl of Pho is just ridiculous especially if its not the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pho spot in town and I recommend it to everyone and anyone. The broth is packed with flavor and clean not oily , all of the veggies are fresh and crisp. Everything is very clean and fast-paced.  I'm a very picky eater and have a hard time most places when it comes to getting my order right but never once have they messed up my order... I even order to go confidently knowing they won't screw things up. The service is very fast for such a busy place and they're polite to my standards they make sure your cup is filled and like most Vietnamese restaurants are trying to get you fed and taken care of not make small talk to butter you up for a big tip (which I think many people are not used to and see it as bad service instead of doing a good job and efficiency ) which I find genuine and worth a bigger tip. If you do ever order to go make sure to ask for any extra sauce you may want because you only get what you order."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 3 stars!?  The broth of the pho was de-lish!!
The restaurant was very clean.  The service was fast and friendly.  I will definitely be back pho more!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for BBH. It was one of the better ones that I had in the states. The desert drink was good too (jelly, bean and Coco milk)."}
{"text":"The pho here is amazing! Service isn't too great but in all honesty the food makes up for it.  This place has the best crispy spring rolls, they're fresh and absolutely delicious.  The food here is very authentic, which is another reason the service doesn't bother me that much.  No one is rude here or mean.  They're just constantly busy, which makes sense for a tiny place that's constantly busy. As long as you have time the food is worth it here and incredibly affordable.  Definitely a place to try if you're on this side of town. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious and fast service. Love the Pho, hot tea and recommend visiting it at least once a week! (Lol) I recommend this place for dinner or lunch, intimate setting with a clean atmosphere. Here's a picture of my food... #29, Vegetable Pho with tofu"}
{"text":"Quick review: Came here with a vegas resident. Didn't try the pho, but did try the bun bo hue. Pretty good serving for a large. I asked for extra noodles which was perfect. The soup wasn't that spicy but had an ok amount of flavor. Wish there was more flavor. 

I like this place bc they have lots of noodle soups, not just the Pho. They have bun rieu - which I haven't had in a long time. I usually eat this at my grandma's house. 

Its quite a drive from the strip. The prices are decent."}
{"text":"After a couple days of eating rich French cuisine on the strip, I needed a break and decided to have some Pho to cleanse my system. Located in a stripe mall with ample parking, this restaurant is large, clean, and sensibly well decorated. The AC is on creating a cool atmosphere. This might actually be one of the nicest Vietnamese restaurant I've been to! Our pho #21 came with everything. The quality of the meat, noodles, vegetable were high and fresh. The beef broth was full of flavor and delicious. The price was a little higher than what I'm used to. But the price might be commensurate with other restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Perfect Pho! Stock was seasoned just right; the meat and noodle was just the right portion. Nothing you could ask for more."}
{"text":"The worst vietnamese resto ! They wont give your receipt , you have to ask for it and they will include the 15 percent gratuity in it , so if you dont look on your receipt you will give more tip ! Worst customer service !"}
{"text":"Yuck!!!
My wife and I went to Pho Saigon 8 yesterday. My wife ordered the Pho Dac Biet and I ordered the Pho Ga.
1. To get somebody to the table to take our order was a miracle. Service was terrrible...
2. My wife's Pho Dac Biet (means pho specialty with 5 combo meat & documented on their menu) was short changed. There was only 3 types of meat. We mentioned this to the management and they argued with us. At the table, the manager called my wife a liar. My god, the food was right in front of us. Hello????
3. Pho Ga that I received had the plastic wrapping and parts of the strings in the PHO!! Yes, the cooks cooked the strings and plastic in the broth. And, I showed this to him. 
We were so disgusted with this restaurant. No wonder alot of people told us to stay away. After this experience, we recommend the same.. 
Cons: Bad Service, menu cut corners, careful what you eat"}
{"text":"Clean, no wait, fast food, large portions, good pho, no-English-no-nonsense. Exactly what you'd want the morning after a night filled with regrettable actions. Pretty window blinds (though I don't think that contributes to the ratings). Now if I could just locate Pho Saigon 1, Pho Saigon 2, Pho Saigon 3, Pho Saigon 4, Pho Saigon 5, Pho Saigon 6, and Pho Saigon 7..."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars, I would. I've been to this restaurant in several times of hopes it would improve but now it just reached a new low. The chicken and beef frequently taste like rubber and are hard to chew. And today, I found a dead insect in my vegetable soup!!!! Absolutely disgusting! How dare you serve food to people and allow them to eat the nasty shit that happens to \"appear\". I will never be eating here again. Please beware, everyone."}
{"text":"It is very good and always packed ! The broth is amazing ! Service is sometimes a little jumbled as there are multiple people trying to help you !!takes forever to get your check and end up just walking to the register ! 

They have a great selection of Pho ! Apps are good but been to other places and they are better !!"}
{"text":"The best Pho in Las Vegas. I love everything here. Super clean and fresh foods. All the staffs are friendly and professional. They just remodeled the shop. Looking so much nicer. Also they serve alcohol and have karaoke after 10pm till midnight. New foods added for night time, c len xào da and chim cút chiên b is my favorite ones. Definitely recommend to my friends and clients about this place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Pho, consistently yummy!! AND, they have a great to-go menu!!"}
{"text":"It was empty when i entered which was odd because its right next to LV Athletic on easter. But it soon filled up. I ordered Rare Beef Pho and Spring Rolls and a Vietnamese Coffee all were on poi t and the pork in the spring roll wasnt gamey so i thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal. The staff is cool and they all pitch in to help which meant i wasnt waiting long for anything. The food got to the table lightning fast. Good place recommend it"}
{"text":"7.1.17 @ 8pm was my 2nd visit.  Place is new and I have been to their other 2 locations.  Typical cheap Asian set up.  The food is good but the service is horrible. The young male waiter is has no social skills.  I get it, there is no service at most if not all Vietnamese restaurants.  When the check came my wife went to pay at the front. The check was like 41 & change, she gave him 45$ worth and got her change back and the SOB says to her and I quote \"No Tip\" with attitude, so she responded it \"its on the table\".  Lucky for him she didnt tell me this until we got home.  In my 48 yrs of life, not once have I encountered such attitude from the wait staff.  These Viet places dont provide service, just food and they expect 5 star tipping.  You work on tip so work for it.  My wife tipped 8usd but we shall never go to any Saigon 8 again.  Yes they talk about you behind your back when you leave crappy tip, I know cuz I can understand them.  Its the typical Viet attitude wanting things for free or more of it.  Go back to your to your caveman ways yo... from another Viet to Saigon 8.....\"yeah I am a banana but I love it\""}
{"text":"We were trying this place for the first time. Not only did we ever get asked what we wanted to drink but I found a caterpillar in the lettuce that came with the egg rolls. Luckily we had just started eating when I noticed it. We were so grossed out we couldn't eat anymore. We told the waiter and all he said was oh sorry about that and walked away. We ended up leaving the place. The manager told us I won't charge you for the egg rolls but we still had to pay for the pho which we hardly touched..not going back there again."}
{"text":"The pho here is very good, not 5-star excellent, but very good. 

My usual go-to when out and about is Pho Kim Long but my office is located very close to Pho Saigon 8, so as a captive audience it certainly satisfies when craving pho for lunch. 

The service definitely leaves a lot to be desired in that no dialog is created (at least the times I have been here) and \"friendly\" isn't an adjective I would use to describe the employees.

That said, I'm not here to make friends, I want to eat soupl. And Pho Saigon 8 provides piping hot, delicious pho in less than 2 mins of putting in your order."}
{"text":"I ordered Com ga roti and was disappointed how dry the chicken was. Portion was small and they have a nerve to charge $10.25 .  My husband ordered bun bo hue and he said no flavor at all. He had to add lots of fish sauce in order to eat. I cant really trust some of these previous reviews, maybe those are reviews are from their own people. Service was also poor. First time and last time too"}
{"text":"The food was decent.  I didn't expect to get good Vietnamese food in Las Vegas... This place totally surprised us.  I came here with a large group including some of my uncles and aunts.  You know how Vietnamese elderlies are, they are picky.  And yet, they were happy with the food here.  They love it.  We had pho, hu tieu, bun rieu, bun bo hue, Korean short ribs over tomato rice.  All of them were good."}
{"text":"AWESOME pho.  The hubby had the dry rice noodle dish and his was excellent as well.  The spring rolls were good but I could tell they didn't make it to order.  Anybody who likes spring rolls know that it has to be made WHEN the customer orders or it it's just not as good!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. I order a vermicelli half beef half pork. They said they couldn't do half beef and half pork for  an order so I requested that I pay extra for the other side of meat. The owner refused and say they were not willing to do it either I got pork vermicelli or beef vermicelli. They were not willing to accommodate me!!! When I was willing to pay extra. Horrible customer service and horrible accommodation for people that just want to have a meal and willing to pay extra for food that is not included in the original menu item. I was not trying to get comped or get free food I was trying to pay for what I wanted. It is ridiculous that this is the only place that does not do half beef half pork when all of the pho Vietnamese restaurants do it. Extremely ridiculous. The sever was rude and not welcoming at all. Will not be returning here ever again. Some restaurants need to realize that there is plenty of competition and other places are willing to not only have better food but better customer service. We live in Las Vegas, our industry is service, experience.... learn something from other places!"}
{"text":"The Pho has a tasty base with plenty of meat. For those who do not care for Pho, this place has plenty of other dinner options. Pricing on the menu is very fair for what you order.  This location is always busy, and they are able to keep up with the pace. I recommend and don't forget to try the iced coffee.  It's great for those who love a great caffeine jolt!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite pho for over a decade and I've lived in several metropolitans. The beef broth is the best I've tasted. The space is large enough to accommodate big groups and if the place is full you're never waiting too long for a table. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Um, wouldn't go back.

Service - was very bad.
Food - already forgot about it.
Ambience - nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try the snails with coconut sauce, but it was not good. $12 for about 20 mini snails. Sauce tasted fine but some of the snails were green and slimy and it just was not worth the money. It tasted like the frozen ones you can get at the oriental market for $5. 
The rest of the food was great! 
My favorite was the che 3 mau dessert. Only $3.25 and everything tasted great and cooked just right! 

We ordered rice combos, bun cha ha noi and vermicelli. 

Didn't try the pho because I read reviews that it wasn't good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing food and the cleanest windows I've ever seen. The inside is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We enjoying coming here for Pho but the past several times I haven't been getting Pho only because i don't feel good after eating it. But i do usually get the #52 Korean BBQ Beef Ribs but this time I changed my usual order to #59 Beef Tenderloin and that was delicious as well. I love how it is tender and full of flavor, i was afraid it was going to be salty but it was perfect! Also ordered a thai tea which was a little thick for my liking you can definitely tell it was heavy and creamy. We will continue taking our big party of relatives who want pho for dinner here."}
{"text":"The pho tai is top notch, especially on a cold winters day.  But what really sets Pho saigon apart is their crispy egg rolls.  Its a must try."}
{"text":"Great tasting pho, however, the my hai my tho was a bit salty. The service was good, our server was attentive and checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. That's good service, except for the only one napkin per person deal. Lol. They provided us with more when asked though. Anyways, it's good pho!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times very good I like the broth here better than some other places its beefier tasting"}
{"text":"A friend took me to lunch for pho and I was not disappointed. This place was clean, well kept, and the servers were friendly. The pho broth had some really good flavors. There was plenty of meats and a variety of choice of noodles (a new experience for me). I will have to return to try the other noodle choices. Love the fact that it's nearby."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious, however their customer service could use a little bit of work. We waited about 15 minutes to have someone take our order and only had our waters refilled once without having to ask someone to help us. 
Even so, we will continue to eat here because the food is great and we love the environment!"}
{"text":"Worst service! Will not come back. Came in around 10am for a small bowl of pho with a friend. After order was taken, waited 30mins and didn't see anything. I asked an elderly server how much longer for a small bowl of pho? She walked away and responded \"there's a lot of order before you, it will be out\". How rude is that? I understand when you're under staff, but no respect for your customers at all? About 5 mins later my pho came out, but not my friend's bbh.... we had to yelled out at the server to get her attention and asked where's my friend's order? Did you guys forgot about it? Honestly, We were about to leave that place but my friend had an appointment at next door salon, so we tried to be more patience... So when her food came out, she had few bite and had to run. It was a wasted 45mins wait for Small now of Ph and a bowl of BBH. 
Service here before was a lot better. What happened?"}
{"text":"I think this Pho restaurant is just fine overall. Perhaps I never had an issue with the service here, or perhaps I know not to really expect much in terms of service in small culturally unique joints such as this one. I also think the language barrier plays a role in the type of service you receive.   The service was ok, no one was rude nor made us feel rushed while we, two of the most indecisive people in the world, reviewed the menu. The Pho was good enough to warrant a return visit when I am not feeling like driving too far from my house for a bowl of pho. They provide all of the necessary standards such as the condiments (I love me some siracha!) and a heaping plate full of additions such as fresh herbs, sprouts and lime to add as needed.  I think Pho Little Saigon across the street and this joint are almost identical in service and in quality. My review is more of a 3.5 star but I will round it up as I am feeling generous."}
{"text":"I usually get pho here because it close to where I live and it's pretty decent. I get the chicken pho and my fiance usually gets their rare steak Pho--both are pretty good and I like their fresh spring rolls. The pho is good because the broth is flavorful enough and I feel there is a good balance of the meats and the vegetables. Can't say that I like their vermicelli dishes though, based off the shrimp vermicelli dish I got. The shrimp was poorly cooked (dry) and there wasn't enough vegetables in the mix to balance everything out. 

I've been told by my Vietnamese friends that this place is some what \"Americanized.\" I guess I can see that....Oh and did I mention, at one point I was mortified to order from here because of their grade 'C'  rating? Yeah...I hope I didn't catch some food borne illness during that period..."}
{"text":"One of the better pho restaurants in LV. However the service is not good. I asked for meat on the side and the waitress told me that the kitchen is too busy for them to do that. A few minutes later, I see the table right next to have rare meat on the side. Horrible. But I can't grade it too low because the food is good."}
{"text":"Line was long and they are not organized took long for them to serve I've been going here for 4 years they need a bigger restaurant! Food is great but terrible service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to Pho Saigon 8 when we first started dating.  I was skeptical because I was a die hard Pho So 1 fan.  Obviously when you're loyal to a certain restaurant it's hard when you stray...what if you cheat on your go-to and it isn't as good?  Well, Saigon 8 certainly surprised me.

I only order three things at Vietnamese restaurants: Pho Tai, Com Bo Luc Lac, and egg rolls.  Saigon 8 absolutely knocks it out of the park with all three of these dishes.  

I do slightly prefer Pho So 1's tomato rice with their bo luc lac, but the onions are more prominent in Saigon 8's version.  The fresh coconut juice here is always fresh and delicious too!

I never order anything else on the menu so I can't speak for any other dishes, but the food is always consistently great here and the waiters are friendly as well. 

When this location opened closer to my house I wanted to cry tears of joy. My lazy self never wants to drive more than 5-10 minutes for food...now, I don't have to ever again (for pho at least). YAY!"}
{"text":"My husband, my 7 year old daughter, and I wanted to have some pho, and we already knew about Pho So 1 back home, so we decided to try Pho Saigon 8 because of the rave reviews I found on the internet. We arrived around 2:30pm on Monday 12/29/08. It was pretty crowded, but we were seated right away.

We ordered #1 Cha Gio - Vietnamese fried egg rolls $5.45; #11 Pho Tai - large bowl of noodle soup with rare eye round steak $7.50; and #54 Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong - grilled sliced pork, served with vegetables and steamed rice. The food came out right away and everything was really good. We wrapped the fried egg rolls with large lettuce leaves and dipped them in the sweet chili sauce; it was delicious! I added the jalapenos and hot sauce to my pho and it was yummy too! And the sliced pork was great too! We devoured everything! When we were done, we went to the cashier with our table number to pay. The food was great, but the prices were a little higher than most Vietnamese restaurants. Next time, I'd like to try the chicken pho, beef stew, and the Korean BBQ beef ribs."}
{"text":"Best pho place in Vegas in my opinion. Service and food was amazing! I will be coming back here for sure and referring my family and friends."}
{"text":"Came here with my family looking for pho in Vegas, was a fairly pleasant experience. We waited for about 10 minutes (this place seems to get packed real quick) during lunchtime and were seated promptly. Service was good, food came out in an appropriate amount of time. I had the standard pho dac biet, which came out to taste like your everyday bowl of pho right out of Westminster. Since I had the flu, this bowl of goodness was a lifesaver. Nothing amazing, but it will get the job done if you are a Vietnamese family looking for familiar food vacationing in LV."}
{"text":"So happy that this place opened near work. Had Pho Tai today and the soup was hot and tasty. I also had a refreshing coconut on the side. Got a free egg roll today, which is a bonus. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here at Pho Saigon 8, and apparently they also have a couple of other locations. The place was clean, and the service was very good. I started off with the eggrolls, which were very good, but not greasy. For dinner I had the beef pho. The broth was really good and fresh. I ordered a large pho, and interestingly it came with a good portion of beef, but not so much in noodles. I was still very much full and it definitely hit the spot. I must say this place is one of the better pho places in Vegas, and I'm happy that they have a location in the Southwest side if town. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessed with the Pho (beef) here. Thai tea is brewed near perfect and the Boba is always an added bonus. 

The broth was clear,  and has a great flavor. I ALWAYS take a few spoons of broth and sip it before adding anything. I even have my kids doing it. You have to be able to taste it for what it is. If the broth can stand the taste test alone, then you known the bowl is worth the cost.  The plate full of basil, bean sprouts, lemon and jalapeños was plentiful, and super fresh. 

My first time there, there was three of us. It was near lightening speed from when they took our pho orders to when the kitchen staff came out and delivered it to our tables. Seriously, I don't think even 3 minutes passed. Yay, for fast service!

The wait staff and cashier are bit lacking,  which is unfortunate. I asked the waiter for to-go bowls and waited far too long. Finally had to ask cashier, when son went to pay.

Our second trip,  the food and drink was just as good as the first time.  However, the lightening speed was gone, and actually felt we waited a longer time than normal. I will say it was packed on Sunday, so I understand.

All in all I love the Pho. I'm obsessed. I think about it all the time. If it weren't for Lent, I would be slurping it down right this very moment instead of writing this review."}
{"text":"Thanks for bringing Pho 8 as an addition to other Vietnamese restaurants to this area. I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown just to eat anymore. I enjoyed every dish I ordered so far. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I go to eat pho in town, it is so authentic and delicious. Getting great food for such an affordable price in an authentic venue is probably what makes this my favorite pho restaurant."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the feeling I got was to walk out and don't eat here . But we ended up staying. The service is very whatever . I ordered a drink it cane in a styrofoam cup which wasn't what I expected from a sit down restaurant ... We ordered the food  it came pretty quickly . It was ok nothing to write home about..  just so so . Don't see myself coming back to this place . there's plenty of good Vietnamese restaurants on Spring Mountain Road.."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever had. Actually I wouldn't even call it customer service. From the minute we walked in the atmosphere was unfriendly and uninviting. People that came after us were helped first. They never took our drink order and right before we ordered our food we almost walked out. We should have... Because it only got worse. Once we ordered our food and it arrived we were never asked if everything was ok or if we needed anything else. It looked like all of the employees had a frown on their faces the entire time we were there. Their lucky I paid and I definitely didn't leave a tip which I have never done in my life. The food was descent and with horrible customer service I would NEVER GO BACK. This place needs some customer service training, good luck."}
{"text":"The food is always great and comes out quickly.   Crispy eggrolls and pork vermicelli bowl are some faves.   Service is polite and never pushy.   Great place for a delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"when i lived in the area this was my go-to spot

it's better than 8/10 of its neighboring competitors... 

I always went for the spring rolls and the steak pho or the combo pho and it never disappointed.

solid and reliable"}
{"text":"The food is the best in town but the services is below par. But you know what they say about asian restaurants. The poorer the services the better the food is."}
{"text":"I've dined in this place at least five times this past month, which should pretty much illustrate how devoted I am to this restaurant. Food is delicious, reasonably priced, and much closer than Chinatown. Above all else, it feels very clean there. My new go-to spot for Viet food - don't go to Annie Pho, Pho 88, or Jenni pho."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled that I use 2 live 5mins from little saigon in OC. . .
Its always good to go with someone that speaks vietnamese fluently! hehe
We ordered eggrolls, 3 small bowls and 1 large bowl of pho. . .
the noodles didn't seem fresh.  . .but the eggrolls were delicious!
The place was pretty full for lunch.
But to our surprise when we asked for the bill, it came to $40!!!
$40?!?!! r u serious?!?! we were used 2 $4 bowls of pho in OC!
It was worth a try."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I rarely write one star reviews (check my other reviews on different restaurants) but I had to write this because of the HORRIBlE service that we received today! We ordered on the phone and they don't repeat your order back to you but when they get your order wrong, they claim that it's your fault. I am honestly not a difficult customer by any means but this place lacks any sort of customer service. We placed a simple order on the phone and repeated it to the lady multiple times. 

When my bf arrived to pick up the order, the order was wrong. Instead of 59 it was 69 that they gave. The lady said, \"this is what you got, what do you want? An add on?\" And he was trying to explain that the order was wrong. They started raising their voices at him basically blaming him for their mistake. So they get him the correct order and the order looked half of what is normally served. They clearly were annoyed and didn't care. They're lucky that he already paid and tipped before noticing the error because they did not deserve the tip. 

I completely understand that mistakes can happen but blaming the customer and raising their voices because THEY misunderstood is terrible business ethic. If they simply acknowledged their mistake and corrected it appropriately then all would be fine. This is not how to run a restaurant or any business for that matter. What a shame because I have family, friends, and co-workers that love pho but I would not recommend coming here to any of my friends and family any longer due to the terrible service. I'd recommend going to a different pho place, there's a ton in Vegas anyway."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of pho, so I hope this review proves to be useful for those who are like me, and would rather eat something else at Vietnamese restaurants.  This place is closer to me than Chinatown, so that's a plus for me.  My favorite dish is #71, the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, a.k.a. grilled sliced pork and fried egg rolls over vermicelli noodles and vegetables.  The pork has great flavor, almost a sweet taste to it, and I love the combination of pieces of pork and eggroll, noodle, and peanuts in one chopstick-ful (as opposed to spoonful).  Delicious and cheap!  

It can get pretty busy during both lunch and dinner, so the service leaves much to be desired during those times.  Also, the parking lot is shared with various other popular establishments, so it can be hard to find a close parking spot during peak times. 

My experience with takeout orders has been positive as well.  The orders are packed well and the time estimates are pretty accurate."}
{"text":"Very very good pho broth! I get the special with everything on it! Their fried rice is good as well however it's on the stickier side . I often order to go, they are very fast! So far best pho broth I've had here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pho' Saigon 8 is such a pleasantly wonderful surprise for me! My son and his beautiful girlfriend brought me here for lunch over Labor weekend. I have been back 3 more times this week with friends!!

The soups are a rice noodle base with almost unlimited combo's, seriously! (Maybe 50 different combo's!) portion are great, the small is not small and the large could possibly feed a family of 4! Jk

Absolutely love this place!! Get the today!! This is a great, fresh soup meal! You will be full on their soup, yes, on soup!"}
{"text":"Best PHO in Vegas.  A must \"hangover food\"restaurant  or just for a great meal, I've eaten PHO all over Vegas and Los Angeles this place is the best, great flavor , good size meal , fast service."}
{"text":"So this review has been a long time coming. As the Duchess of Pho Saigon 8 I figured it was about time to show some love. I've tried just about every bowl of pho in Vegas and I must say this is probably my second choice (Viet Noodle Bar being the first). Flavorful broth, tender meat, fresh greens, everything goes together so well. Also, we love our waitress too. Ngon (short hair & glasses), she's the best. Super sweet and always takes great care of us. My kids love her, she's one of the reasons why we keep coming back cause some of the other waitresses aren't as good at their job...you'll know who I'm talking about when you go. 

Now back to the food. Your bowl is at your table within minutes of ordering. The Pho here is \"Phonomenal\" Perfectly flavored broth and very consistent. The noodles aren't soggy or clump together like most places. I suggest #11, #13 or #18 and ask for some hot tea as soon as you sit down. Egg rolls are always fresh & extra crispy. So many tasty rice dishes but the grilled pork chop & Korean BBQ short rib never disappoint. And the coffee, WOW! Get a cup if you need to be up for two days straight, haha!! 

Great food. Service could be better (with the exception of one waitress). I know many ppl are partial to Pho Kim Long down the street. I've been there too many times to think that ppl probably only go there because the of the name. So if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, eat here."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had! I usually don't like pho because I think it's too bland and most people prepare them in a way that the broth and the meat really smell (I'm sensitive to beef smell especially, if it's not prepared carefully). Anyways, this place is good! I don't remember the name of the pho I got, but it was spicy and had \"special\" noodles that took them a while to prepare if they have to make a new batch. The pho had a subtle pork flavor broth, and the spicy paste adds the right amount of kick (not too hot where your tongue is in pain). And FYI to those people who love flavor, pho is not meant to be super flavorful like thai boat noodles and such. Think of it as your chicken noodle soup but Vietnamese style. 

I also love the spring rolls, they actually had quality pork, and the egg rolls. The egg rolls came with all the veggies so you can wrap them in it! I've never had that before! It adds that needed veggie crunch to your egg roll.

And what amazes me the most is GOOD SERVICE! lol I'm very impressed! The waiters are polite and they don't give you the look like most Asian restaurant workers give you. Overall, good experience and I'm always down to go there when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho I've ever had and the most hospitable service also! I will recommend this to everyone around."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Came in because it was close to the house and was pleasantly surprised considering there are several pho places in the southwest area."}
{"text":"walked in at 11:42, and was told they were closed. Signage said open till 12:00. I realize people don't want to stay later than they are open, but I asked to order to go, and was still turned away, Oh well, a 10 minute drive to China town it is..."}
{"text":"I am local, been there multiple times and never disappointed. The portions are big with lots of meet, service is very good for this type of restaurant. Price is also reasonable. Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Been there twice, try their Bun Bo Hue,  the size is small and expensive. poor service. other pho downstreet is even better and cheapper."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer pho places I've been to in vegas - it's really clean, and there's a peaceful little fountain in the front of the restaurant that prepares you for your zen like pho experience as you enter.  I got the #18, and the soup was pretty darm good.  Not the best I've ever had, but probably one of the better ones I've had, especially in vegas.  It's a bit more beefy and less marrow-y/stinky, and doesn't have as much onion flavor as I would like, but it's still a pretty densely flavored soup.  One strange thing is that they didn't have any fish sauce at the table - we were going to ask for some, but ended up not needing it since the broth was pretty tasty (even though it was stink-less).  The summer rolls are so-so, and kind of on the pricey side, but they do have these really delicious chargrilled pork summer rolls that were REALLY good - they're pretty much pork sausages wrapped with scallion and a crispy egg roll shell with a really tasty satay dipping sauce.  Yum.  As a side note, they don't really give you too many vegetables, but if you ask for another place they'll give you one.  And the basil and bean sprouts were really really fresh, which is always a big plus."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous......always hot, fresh, and super yummy! The service is kind of slow and hard to get refills on drinks but otherwise its great....I don't mind the mediocre service in exchange for delicious food."}
{"text":"If you really like pho and enjoy the atmosphere and quality of a good pho then this is the place to go. The staff is always doing something to better the experience which is great and the service is quick as well probably my favorite place to eat pho within las veg"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often when I'm craving pho. Especially a nice big bowl of soupy goodness after a night out on the town. I sometimes take my parents here for lunch or dinner because they love noodles. They always like coming here. It is packed here no matter when I'm here but I barely have to wait. I love that as I know everyone else loves to eat here too but I won't have to sacrifice for that validation."}
{"text":"I've only been here one time, but I didn't have a single issue that a lot of the other reviewers harped about. I was promptly seated and had my order taken. I went with a standard Phó dish, a combination beef bowl, and was thoroughly satisfied with it. The prices, contrary to what some people are saying, were also completely fair... Especially for Vegas. I plan on eating here again!"}
{"text":"When I used to live in Vegas this was the only place my family would go for pho. 

4 years after I've moved away and this place is still just as good.
The soup is nice and hot, large bowls, lots of noodles and meat, soft tendons."}
{"text":"Served me cilantro, twice. I was very clear about my allergy to cilantro and could very well have ended up in the ER getting a shot. But because of my husbands good eyes the crisis was avoided. 

Were they apologetic? No. 

Remorseful? No. 

Did they do anything to compensate? Only after pitching a fit was my meal comped. (which by the second send back I told them not to bother making again). Seriously?!? You want to charge me for a meal I sent back twice and did not eat a bite of? Bye!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for the last year. This is a great pho place. They have great service and the pho is delicious. I eat here 3 times a week and i would recommend the number #11."}
{"text":"The best pho and bun cha dish I've ever had. This place best Pho 88, Jenni pho and Pho Kim Long in my book. Fresh food and clean and cozy restaurant. Thumbs up recommended."}
{"text":"One Friday night I made a call to pick up some food. when I arrive there was nobody around when I finally found somebody I guess he was a bust her I let him know I was there for a pick up he didn't even say hello to me didn't smile and when I told him I was there for a pick up he didn't even respond to me he just looked at me with the blank face and then walked away. I wasn't feeling good and I was already upset that I had to wait finally I found another man asked me how can I help you and I told him I have been waiting for my food I let your other employee know but I guess he didn't tell you anything. He apologized and guess what my food was on the table right there for like 10 minutes or longer so I told him I don't know why he wouldn't say anything or if he didn't understand my English maybe he should've asked somebody for help. He then said oh sorry and he said I wasn't wearing a jacket it's cold out and I told him yeah I was just planning to run in and out but I'm here waiting. So I paid for my food and went home when I got home my chicken and noodle plate was cold and I had to re-cook them at least my pho still somewhat hot. I was very annoyed with the service here I don't think I will be back and it's unfortunate because it is very close to my house."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place so far. They do it correctly, you can get tendon and tripe (my measure of authenticity), and they always have plenty of lime and basil. I like the spring rolls, you gotta add Sriracha to the peanut sauce tho. They only have like 3 smoothie flavors but avocado is one of them, so none of the other favors matter, and they also have Thai tea for when you don't want to drink avocado (which is rare). I can't give it 5 stars bc it's not the best *ever* but it's definitely the best I've found in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"This place is FRESH!!! Good prices too! Good vibe & clean!! They gave tendon & tripe too!"}
{"text":"Ate here after cruising around Spring Mountain Road for a bit...realized that I came here a few years ago based on some yelp reviews.  Ordered the Bun Cha Gio this time...pretty average meal and not a fan of their Cha Gio."}
{"text":"Great Pho! Actually hot like it's supposed to be (not like other local places where the beef doesn't even cook)."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always willing to try new places! 

We were greeted by a guy who sat us right away. Our waitress came by and brought us waters to start. Being first timers, we asked our waitress her favorites on the menu. She was so helpful, nice and patient with us as we decided on our order. Our food came out quick, hot and tasty. Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner and our waitress checked on us a couple times to make sure we were satisfied and liked our food.

The least friendly person in the whole place was the cashier. He didn't say anything to us except to tell us our total. He didn't even offer me my receipt, I had to ask him for it.... probably not a big deal to most people, but I expected the great service until I walked out the door. 

We'll definitely go back to try other things."}
{"text":"If i were still in San Jose then i'd only give 3 stars but considering the Vietnamese population isn't as dense this place is pretty much the only place to get a decent bowl of Pho, 

I give it a 4 because unless a whole shop in San Jose sprouts some wheels and drives down here to set up shop i don't eat Pho anywhere else

Drink a lot of water the MSG is noticeable"}
{"text":"I come from the Bay Area in Northern California, so I was surrounded by so many Vietnamese restaurants growing up and I absolutely love the Vietnamese cuisine. So, since I've moved to Vegas, I've been in the search for my regular Vietnamese spot for whenever I'm craving pho or a vermicelli dish. 

Food:
As I tried Pho Saigon, I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the chicken pho and spring rolls. I usually always order size small when I get pho, but Pho Saigon only does size large, which sucks because I ended up wasting half of my soup. Plus, I was really disappointed for spending so much when I didn't eat it all (my cravings were too strong, I needed to buy pho!). Also, the broth was lacking flavor, and trust me, I love my pho so this really was mediocre. Well, moving onto my spring rolls.. the meat was so dry.. thank god I was able to drench each bite into the peanut sauce and sriracha, cos I couldnt just eat it by itself. 

Service:
I called in for a pick up order and the lady was in such a rush! Once I said my order, she quickly said, \"okay give me 10 minutes\" and hung up. Lol, she didn't give me a price for my order or anything, which made me not even want to go and pick up my order because I actually wanted to make sure I was getting a small size. When I arrived I said I was there for pick up and the lady said the price and it was about $17 for pho and spring rolls, so I know forsure it wasnt a small. I asked how much the price was for a small and that was when she informed me that they do not have small sizes. If I had known that from when I made the order on the phone, I would have said nevermind and didn't order at all because I forsure wouldn't finish that and I didn't want to spend that much on something I wont finish. But because I am not rude, I paid and accepted it anyway. 

Probably gonna try a different Pho joint because this just wasn't what I was expecting from reading all the good reviews.. very disappointed."}
{"text":"It saddens me to give this spot 2 stars since it's been my favorite pho spot for the past 4 years. Last night, half way through I found a bug in my soup! My appetite was ruined and I just wanted to leave. Without making too big a deal I showed the older waitress and she told me it was just an onion, then walked away and had someone else help us and rambled on and on in a different language. The only reason for the 2 stars is the nice girl who helped us after. Won't be coming back. Be better."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Vegas now that the big pho shop at Spring Mountain and Decatur closed.

I usually get chicken pho or the rare flank steak pho - it's kind of fun to get your bowl of pho full of rare beef and watch it finish cooking in the steaming broth.  I find the broth quite flavorful, but I also like to add squirts of lime, splash of rooster sauce, and sprigs of mint to kick it up a bit.  Even a \"small\" bowl will be plenty for you.  Noodles are plentiful and perfectly cooked.

Service can be a bit sparse, but it's gotten better.  Also, the pho gets to your table FAST - so there's not a lot of coming and going to interrupt your dinner conversation, reading, etc.  Pleasant little dining room."}
{"text":"Love the food, not a big fan of the service and the seating is horrible. Don't know who was the genius that bought the tables and chairs for this place because the table legs aren't wide enough to accommodate 2 chairs to where they fit UNDER the tables! Was just there last night and this lady behind me kept pushing her chair into the back of the chair next to me (which was empty, gf sat across from me)  but my chair ain't going noway because it wont fit UNDER the table, since the legs of the table isn't wide enough for 2 chairs. 

Depending of which server you get, service can be bad or decent, getting the order in can take a little while but the food does come out fast once the order is placed.

#1 is delicious, Vietnamese Fried Egg rolls wrapped in veggies then dipped in fish sauce
#15 is my favorite,  beef noodle soup with meatballs and rare round eye steak .
#66 is also very good, Grilled sliced pork over vermicelli and vegetables

Haven't ventured out of trying anything else............"}
{"text":"so we took a shot coming here.. we thought it'd be a sister spot to the saigon 8 on eastern.. and it wasn't.

um, it was ok?  it wasn't as fresh as the one on eastern and a little dingy. the waiter wasn't pleasant and didn't come back at all to see if we needed anything or to refill our waters or drinks.  we had to ask another waiter for refills... so yeah,  we'll never come back"}
{"text":"i like this place!  a good pho place is hard to find, and when I get a craving for good pho, this is definitely the spot.    

the variety is awesome, and they offer rice plates as well.  the grilled pork is good.. and the seafood pho is a favorite.  we always get the eggrolls as an appetizer and it comes with fresh lettuce and cilantro to wrap them in. 

the waiters are friendly... and always good about answering my questions and getting our order right.  

i agree with the other reviews that say your practically sitting in your neighbors laps... but its usually packed so it's not a surprise that they try and accommodate a lot of ppl.  but the pho is the best i've had in vegas so far, so when it's pho the fam wants, it's saigon 8 they'll get!"}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews of this restaurant, and cannot believe they were in the same place.  Some mention Chinatown, by the way, and that's not where Pho Saigon 8 is.  It is well west of there.  One reviewer mentioned smelling the fish sauce at the table.  Sorry, they don't have fish sauce at the table unless it comes with the specific food you ordered.  They have srirocca (hot sauce) and hoisin (sweet sauce) at each table.

I don't know how you can complain about service here.  You are given a table, and a waiter quickly comes to take your order.  If you order pho, which I usually do, it takes three to five minutes to arrive.  There are three types of broth for the pho, and all are delicious.

I have been to Pho Saigon 8 scores, perhaps hundreds of times over the years, and never received a poor dish or bad service. I consider it the best pho in town, and it is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Oh, and I have met several of my favorite Vietnamese professional poker players here."}
{"text":"I am a big Pho fan.  This place is kind of hidden in the back of a shopping complex, but it is worth finding.  The flavor is there and the serving size is pretty good."}
{"text":"Best pho in the city! My favorite is #18
Ive tried lots of others but the broth here is the best!"}
{"text":"Order food from here almost weekly. The food is great and the pho is one of the best in town. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've had some bad pho back in the day and this is one of the places that serves bad pho. The blandest tasting broth I've ever had. Limp ass bean sprouts. Withered basil leaves and watered down hoisin sauce. If I were to rate it on service alone I would give it 5 stars cuz the ppl working here are nice but that's all the compliment I can give this place."}
{"text":"Pho was excellent! Tasty broth, fresh mint, bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapeño, limes everything you need to squeeze and tear to yummy up your Pho. Price was reasonable and service was good enough although our waiter had little sense of humor of my jokes sucked. Could have been those EDC gummies from last night ......... but, that's another story. Stop by, I recommend it and that's really all that matters isn't it? Enjoy"}
{"text":"Can't really give an accurrate review. Decided to walk here from mandalay bay. We made it but not before we were too hungry and went to Pho Kihn Do on the way. Definitely take a cab if ur on the strip. Chinatown is allot farther than it seems on the map...lol"}
{"text":"This place is great! They are quick and the food is good. They are always packed. Great atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"If you love Pho, then this is  the place to get it. I have been to multiple Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas and Henderson and this is by far the best location for Pho.

I order the vegetable tofu pho and vegetable spring rolls (my most favorite Vietnamese side item) . The vegetables are always fresh. 

The down side is the customer service. None of the staff smile or seem happy for business, but the GOOD Pho out weighs the slight negative. I always come here when I'm in Henderson.
I would eat here everyday if i could."}
{"text":"If you want some very very very BASIC PHO, come here.

Their pescatarian options are not really pescatarian. They do not carry seafood broth. Their sizes are very small. 

Their beef pho is adequate enough and okay but could be better. They don't use a lot of different beef products. Just flank tendon and etc. 

If you want amaetuer and mediocre pho. This is the place"}
{"text":"My family and I have been a customer here for many years. This is one of our favorite Pho restaurants in Las Vegas. The service and food is consistently excellent and very good taste. Today when paying for my food,  an automatic tip was added to the bill. Not a big issue for me as I always tip. But if you're not paying attention, you might not knowingly double tip as they didn't tell us upfront of adding the tip automatically to the bill."}
{"text":"In adding to my quest to try to find the best pho in Vegas I decided to try this place out next. I'll keep it simple for places not up to par.

Tables were dirty with sticky stuff not properly cleaned.

Never got my drink refilled.

Pho broth was way too salty and no beef flavor or pho aroma.

Skimpy on the noodles.

No option of a combo with tripe, tendon, meatballs, and rare beef on the menu.

Soup cooled down immediately when vehgies were added and did not wilt at all.

For having so many employees you would think they have time to properly clean the tables and refill your drinks. Guess not. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times. The service gets worse each time. This past trip we noticed the broth had an overload of MSG in the Pho. It's bad when you can notice it! Find a different option for pho, this place is a major bust!!"}
{"text":"I love Saigon 8.  One of the best pho spots in Las Vegas!  Don't expect the friendliest service as no pho place ever does, but the staff is pretty pleasant.  Broth and food is flavorful.  Speedy service.  Never been disappointed.  I recommend the crispy spring rolls that you wrap in the lettuce and the Bo Kho(beef stew) with rice noodles.  The spicy bun no hue soup.  Delish!  .. Eat greedy, yours truly -Mizz Loveli"}
{"text":"Wifey ordered a soup and waiter brings out wrong soup. Wife says wrong soup\" 
Waiter: no it's what you ordered. 
Wife : can I have the other soup 
Waiter: no 
Me:hahahahahahahajaha
Wife :pissed."}
{"text":"This place has really good pho. Their noodles are cooked perfectly and their broth is so tasty. Price is very affordable, service is friendly, and parking is convenient. One of the most authentic pho places I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Dropped in for late night dinner after a workout at Planet Fitness conveniently across the street. I can't find anything bad with the place so it must be good? It's open till midnight, it is easy to get to and park, the setting is chill, the service is friendly, food came out timely and was good, $11 for a rice dish with pork which is ok. I got fried rice with pork & egg which was pretty tasty. They also brought out an extra egg roll which was a nice touch. I definitely will drop in here again!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in Vegas ! I got the #16  (rare eye round, flank, and brisket) and the BBQ pork rolls. They were both really good and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok, we just moved here from San Diego, and we had not found any good Pho resturaunts for at least 6 months. I was famished (btw I am 5 months prego) and I was craving Pho, lo and behold near Chinatown, this was the Oasis of Pho. I tried #18, and the broth was heavenly. I went here 2 more times by myself and got the same thing, it was around 10 am on a weekday when I had these heavenly encounters. The service was impeccable. Then on a Saturday morning I decided to share this with my family, and the service was very slow, and the tendons were not added in the soup. Also, I tried the fresh rolls for the 1st time, and they were too sticky, the rice paper was too moist!
So... the reason for my 4 stras: Try not to go here during busy times..other than that, this place and the soup is awesome!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better pho spots I have hit up in Vegas. The bowl came out boiling hot and the large size was piled on with noodles and meat. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. I also tried the eggrolls and though they came with a batch of very fresh and tasty vegetables as well, they were pretty small. I would say just stick to the pho here.

So far from my experience at several pho restaurants in Vegas, I would recommend this place first to any friends visiting."}
{"text":"Juicy Pho off the strip

This place is pretty good for Vegas Pho. Vegas Pho is not the same as SGV Pho. 

Ordered the pork chop rice. It wasn't that good and the amount of pork chop there was very small.

Ate some of  my friend's korean bbq ribs, it was pretty good. 

Ate some of my friend's Pho, it was decent. 

What was really good was the Egg Roll wrapped with lettuce. It was delicious!!!!

Kinda far from the strip, was driving at least 10-15 mins to get here."}
{"text":"This place is a few miles from the Las Vegas Strip... but well worth the drive.  They are very clean and serve some of the best Vietnamese Food I've had!  I recommend trying their #12 Pho, which includes tripe and beef flanks.  

I find it funny that they are called Pho Saigon 8 and my the meal I ordered was $8.00!  

Get here either early or late just not during regular dining times, since parking is limited."}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my co workers, we had a good meal. The prices are great and the food portions are decent. I would definitely come here again. Especially when it's so close to work :P"}
{"text":"Probably one of the decent places to get Pho at in Vegas.  I used to live in Cali so I am spoiled over there with Pho.  Pricing for Pho here is pretty high, but worth it to get a bowl after a night out in a club.  The portion is very well and the quantity of meat in the bowl are plenty.  Broth is always warm and offer amenities/condiments with a bowl.  Place is okay clean.  Place gets busy on the weekends, but service is still quick.  

Parking is easy, lot parking."}
{"text":"Went to this place twice. Had pho twice. It was ok twice. 
The servers are, how should I say, special? The broth isn't the best I ever had. Meh."}
{"text":"This is a great place for noodles everything is fresh and prepared well. Everyone I've brought here really enjoyed the food  and the prices are good."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to get Vietnamese food. 

Some other places offer great pho, but not much else after that. Other places offer not so great pho, while offering other great Vietnamese dishes. This place offers both. 

The pho especially has great broth, which is served piping hot. And the portions are pretty decent for the prices. The restaurant itself is pretty clean as well, something you might not find at other establishments. 

Service is a hit or a miss for me though. 80% of the time service is better than most other establishments. The other 20% isn't bad service, just mediocre. They're pretty fast and attentive, but few speak English. 

Don't forget o get Vietnamese coffee when you go. =p"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here and the food was excellent. 

The service was very lax and non professional. The waitresses were just sitting in the dining room chatting, the kitchen staff were outside smoking. The only person working was the waiter who was an older man. 

The food was really good and arrived to the table fast. I would recommend coming here if you don't mind being niglected after you get your food."}
{"text":"Food was okay... rice was undercooked... service was okay, not the best.  Wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"First time that I went here, it was fine. I wasn't feeling well and couldn't taste no difference in the Pho. I was just happy that we were getting Pho and I think this was one of the places that pop up while we were trying to Yelp close by places for Vietnamese food. Everybody was hungover so we all got Pho. It's only 50 cents more for a large size I believe. 

The next time that I was in Vegas, we went here again because we were lazy to look into other Vietnamese places and I got a different type of Pho which was fine, but service was lacking that day. I think they got kind of annoyed that we wanted to split checks, but the next couple days we got food here again which I will avoid coming back after his trip because I used the bathroom and there was a cockroach laying there dead which made me question if there's any in the kitchen. 

Food is decent, you have a lot of your traditional Vietnamese dish here, even the Vietnamese coffee is made the traditional way with it dripping. But I would question the cleanliness of this place. Thanks for all the food you have provided, but I'll be moving on next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"My fav vietnamese restaurant in the southwest. The food is fresh and delicious. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food is good but SERVICE SUCKS. They forget to put in our order. Waited a long time and charges us 18% gratuity. I don't mind paying it but damn why should I tip for SUCH A HORRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"This is the second closest Vietnamese restaurant to my locale, and is pretty much the only one I frequent if I'm close to home.

Good food, quick prep, normal service.  Vietnamese places aren't renowned for stellar customer service, guys - it's nothing personal.  =P

They recently raised the prices so don't use the online menu if placing a to-go order... Grab one inside on the counter.  That's what I did.

Their Thai tea is pretty darn good, surprisingly.  Sadly, no sauces included with noodle bowls... that's why I keep sriracha and hoisin at home.

#71 with a fried egg = nomz."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon is great, me and all my gfs go there all the time. David is the best and he always tries to make us have a great experience he is really funny and they give the best service!"}
{"text":"I've only had the Pho, but it's delicious. The soup base is amazing. The avocado and jackfruit smoothies are also very good! On top of that, customer service is phenomenal especially the boss lady who owns the restaurant. She's super friendly and makes every feel welcome."}
{"text":"Me & my girlfriend as well as my 1yr old son love this place. Clear deep broth tells me the stock was cared after unlike a cloudy dirty looking one. Anyhow I get the 18 with all the goodies..........finish with fresh thai basil, lime & a little siracha...whats not to love."}
{"text":"Excellent! So happy this location finally opened. The food was great and we loved the soft jazz music in the background. Peter was very attentive and friendly. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot. I have been to a ton of pho spots in Vegas, and this one has some of the best pho broth. Quality of the ingredients is above average. The pho bowls here are a bit smaller then other places, and seem to have smaller portion sizes, however they are much more generous with the meat compared to other places. Also wanted to add, food was served crazy fast.

Honestly my only complaint is the staff where not very attentive and kind of ignored us. 

Besides that, nice spot."}
{"text":"My family always find Vietnamese food very homey & healthy (for the most part). We enjoy the nice hot tea while we wait for our food. The fried spring rolls are really great. 9/10 the vegetables are super fresh & the rolls always come out hot and crispy. We think the pho is really tasty. The last night we had pho the brisket was so perfect & flavorful. My 8 year old splits a bowl with me and we order a side of the amazing grilled pork! The flavor of the pork is out of this world...a little Smokey & sweet. Super yummy! The staff are all very friendly! We come here often due to it being a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Solid pho & pretty tasty egg rolls. Besides the slightly high price for Vietnamese food, I think this place is the best in place in the Henderson area. Like all Vietnamese places, the service is fast and the waiters don't speak English. So, you can always order by the numbers next to the food item. Even though it's not the best pho I've had, I still come here regularly because of its location and good quality. Oh yeah, their fried rice is actually good too, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This is becoming one of my favorite vietnamese restaurants. I don't have to drive all the way to Spring Mountain and it's near my house. It is located in the plaza accross the street from Walmart on 215/Rainbow. 2 of my friends kept telling me to try this restaurant and I am sooo glad I finally did. It looks like the have 3 other locations in town.
My favorite items to get from here are the vegetable spring rolls-fresh and sooo delicious and veggie pho with beef broth (and no I am not a vegetarian). Each time I have gone here, it's packed with people, but you don't have to wait too long to be seated. I can't wait to try other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"I have been eating pho for 25 years, not bad for a white guy, and have tried almost all the pho stops in Vegas and this one is the best.  My grad school advisor who is from China loved it even.  Their prices are no different than other places around the country.  I laugh when people say their grandmother's is better.  Well my grandmother's lefse was the best to me but maybe not to you."}
{"text":"The only Pho restaurant my boyfriend and I have been going to for years. The only bad part are the rude servers. I guess that is what most Asian restaurants seem to be. Service needs to change, the food is still great every time.

I usually get the Vermicelli with chicken or pork. It gives you that garlic taste for a while, so bring gum! It's pretty good, average. For an appetizer, the Spring Rolls are crispy and hot with the lettuce on the side. I like to dip it in their fish/vinegar sauce.The Pho with everything in it, including Tripe is just right! You can never go wrong with that. Broth is flavorful. I love Pho!"}
{"text":"I ordered #16 Pho and an order of tofu spring rolls to go. Everything was packaged very nicely and tasted absolutely delicious. I ordered the large thinking I was somehow going to finish it on my own, but I was wrong the servings are huge and now I have delicious leftovers. I loved the crispy tofu inside the spring rolls with the peanut sauce. The broth from the pho was outstanding. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"There are many-a pho restaurants that seem to be on every corner of Eastern and the 215.  My friend had heard that this was a decent spot for a bowl of pho and upon arrival I was happy to note that it was not too crowded.  Once we were seated, we ordered 2 small bowls... I can't recall the number, but it was with the rare flank steak.

The bowls came out quickly and I requested some nuoc mam sauce and lettuce to put in my soup.  Our server brought back the sauce, but not the lettuce.  I guess it's my fault for not calling him back to the table... The taste of the soup was good.  Not the best pho I have ever eaten, but decent.

The restaurant began to fill up for the lunch rush while we were eating, so I guess we got there just in time.  Our check was dropped off at the table without a word and since we had never been there we weren't really sure if we should go up to the register or wait.  We opted to walk up to the front, which seemed to be the right decision.  I then saw a sign that said Debit/Credit transactions must be over $10 and my soup was only around $7.  I expressed my concern and the lady and the register gruffly told me that I would have to add a tip... which of course I was intending on doing, but the tone and demeanor in which she said it was kind of off.  I'm not sure if I will return because I want to try out some other pho restaurants on that side of town."}
{"text":"Food: 
spring roll-okay
ice coffee- good

family member had the pho they said it was salty
GF had the bun bo hue - was good

Service: simple

Wait: no wait"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that I had read a few reviews before trying Pho Saigon 8 and most of the reviews were regarding how horrible the service was. We actually did not have bad service. They were fast, friendly and ready to go with our to go orders. 

Now for the food. It was just horrible. We ordered:

67. Bun Ga Nuong 7.45
Grilled chicken over vermicelli and vegetables

74. Bun Cha Ha Hoi 7.95
\"Ha Noi\" style grilled sliced pork & pork meatballs served with vermicelli and vegetables

54. Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong 7.45
Grilled chicken served with steamed rice & vegetables

47. Hu Tieu hay Mi Bo Kho - Small
Noodles with beef stew (egg noodles)

The noodles were freezing, the chicken had no flavor and was really dry and the beef stew was so oily and salty that we couldn't get past the look or smell. It was the worst food and such a waste of money. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered a small pho with veggies and shrimps. They gave me  only 3 shrimps and the noodles was already shredded! The caused of shredded noodles was if cooked too long. Also, I placed 1 ordered of spring rolls. When I grabbed the spring roll, it was super cold. Obviously, it wasn't made fresh or right there being made. Seems like it was just taken out the fridge. I'm a Lao girl and that's not how they should serve food like that and am not happy at all! It's a bit pricey and I didn't give them tips at all! I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Very kid friendly and excellent service!! They have scissors, spoons, forks, extra napkins all ready for you so you don't have to ask 5x. The best kid friendly place I've been! Food is delicious as well. We recommend the Thai tea!"}
{"text":"Food on the strip tends to be cheap and disgusting or super expensive and delicious.  Since we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for every meal, we tried this place.  Just a mile down from the strip where all the asia restaurants seem to be, this place was humble in decor, which was a good sign.  However, it was not too packed on a Friday night, not a great sign.  I ordered the Wonton noodle soup and the broth was good but it didn't taste like it went through many hours of meat, bone, and marrow stewing.  The meat within the wonton tasted like it was previously frozen and it didn't have a great balance of meat and veg.  I ordered Thai Ice Tea with Boba and the Boba were super gummy, which meant they had been sitting in syrup for a while.  

Overall, better than McDonalds but not the best Pho place."}
{"text":"Woke up that morning feeling extremely sick. I tried taking a hot shower but it only helped so much. It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest and I couldn't breath. My boyfriend said he was going to take me to china town for pho. The miracle cure for sickness. I surely didn't believe him. 

Walking in I was amazed by the aroma of the building which was beefy goodness. 

Being seated immediately we were given menus but every single pho item looked too similar. How the heck was I supposed to make a decision?! When the waiter came I took trust in his experience and asked if he would order for me and I let him know I was ill. He looked my boyfriend and I up and down and said two #16. One small for you, one large for you. We laughed and said we would also order a side of egg rolls for an app. 

The egg rolls appeared within minutes. When we entered the place was half full and now we noticed the place was packed. Great sign! The egg rolls were in a translucent wrapper and you could see the shrimp and veggies. It was very meaty and fresh and was accompanied by a peanut sauce that looked like gravy. I mixed the red pepper sauce with the peanut sauce to get a spicy salty sauce for the egg roll. Yum!

Next the pho came and my boyfriend immediately said he could have gone with a small bowl. I was a little reluctant as I am picky when sick and the fresh fish that it came with was weird. I'm not used to getting a dish with bean sprouts, fresh herbs and jalapeños with my soups. Alas I trust my boyfriend and dug in. My pho first off was only 8.60 had tons of brisket in it (and another meat I cannot remember) noodles, and onions. My favorite. The broth was the best broth I've ever had in my life and I've had tons! Speaking from experience was I ate only broth for 4 weeks after my tonsils and muscle lining underwent removal. The broth was beefy, flavorful and had depth. There was an enormous amount of meat. Every sook full had meat and onions. The fresh herbs when added kicked up the flavor. After finishing about 1/4th of my bowl my lungs expanded. No joke instantly I felt relieve.. I could breath! Next I could breath through my nose as well. My fatty self couldn't stop and I ate the entire bowl.. Feeling completely better. I was amazed. So amazed I asked to have another bowl of it to go for work tomorrow in case tomorrow morning i woke up sick. 

This is gonna be my go to place when I'm ill."}
{"text":"Why the heck did i try this place again? ... Horrible walked out service just awful didn't even order."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is a solid place to get pho and they have multiple locations s in the Henderson area. 

Came with my family and we all ordered a large #18 pho which comes with rare eye steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe. It was delicious and definitely a good portion of meat and noodles. A solid 4/5.

We also ordered a small bo of bun bo hue - a spicy beef noodle soup which came with a thicker noodle. Wasn't a huge fan of the broth, almost felt a bit watered down spice wise compared to what I've had at other places. For the small bowl for $9.45, I'll probably skip this for next time. 

Other than that, service was good and they gave generous portion of bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños and limes for the pho."}
{"text":"Tried several pho places in Vegas so far and this by far has been the best that we've had near Vegas.  Pho #21 and #24. Even better than some we've had in SF.  Soup was very flavorful and the meat was especially so.  My wife also really  enjoyed the plum drink as well, very good and soothing for dry Vegas weather."}
{"text":"Great food and prices!!! 
Have had several dishes and every one has been outstanding, not only the best pho but some of the best Asian food in Vegas.
And great easy to get to location right off the highway."}
{"text":"Food tonight was not good --- bean sprouts brown, lettuce in wraps was brown also.  The lean meat soup was good.  The service in the restaurant has never been stellar but tonight the service was the topic of our conversation- we had to stand up to get someone to come to our table for a fork- water was never refilled and when we were ready to leave I wanted a to go box and not one person would come to the table. We just decided to leave. When I went to pay the check it was more $$ than I expected and because English is not that well spoken I asked for the receipt. To my surprise they charged a 15% tip--- for a party of 5!!!! It wouldn't have been questioned if the service was good!!!   Won't be back and I will for sure tell everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Greatly disappointed previously, but thought we'd give it another try...and still was unsatisfied. My wife and I enjoy visiting different restaurants on our days off and sadly, Pho Saigon 8 has continued to disappoint. Latest meal was an appetizer of Banh Xeo followed by Korean ribs for her and a small bowl of Pho Tai for myself. The Pho Tai arrived first, then her ribs...after we'd gotten about half way thru our meals (I figured the appetizer had been forgotten), the Banh Xeo was brought to the table.
 
The Korean ribs were not bad, but were nothing special. The ribs were served with rice and kimchee..the kimchee was kinda bland, almost sweet, not red pepper spicy as you'd expect.
 
My Pho was not so good...altho a small bowl, there was not enough broth in the bowl..which was probably a good thing as it tasted like dishwater. 

The Banh Xeo...my past experiences in other Vietnamese restaurants had the shrimp, pork, bean sprouts and scallions included in the frying of the batter.  The Banh Xeo served at Pho Saigon 8 had the batter wrapped around the cold ingredients (the shrimp, bean sprouts and sliced pork) much like a burrito. Very disappointed as it was quite a mess trying to prepare and eat it. And the fish sauce certainly was weak as if it had been watered down. 

We drank water and paid over $30 for this evening. 

None of the people working there are Vietnamese anymore, I'd expect they are Chinese and just don't have the Vietnamese style that once made this a favorite place to eat. We were there at dinner time, 6pm, and it was pretty much empty. 

If you want good Pho, go up the street to the 168 Market and find Pho Sing Sing in the shopping center. An excellent place to eat good Vietnamese food by a Vietnamese family!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho! Would definitely go back for the food, although the Thai tea was terrible. And can't really say much about the service. I would like to think it's maybe the language barrier or maybe the culture, but I've experienced excellent service at other vietnamese restaurants so I am not sure. But I would probably just have to prepare to ask for EVERYTHING I needed from my server before I never see him or her again. Thought it might've been an off night, but it does seem like everyone complains about the service."}
{"text":"When in Vegas for too long,  I get tired of smelling second hand smoke and seeing all the drunkards.  It is refreshing for me to get off the strip for awhile. This pho restaurant is a bit far but worth the drive. It is a big place so no need to wait for a table. Very clean and many severs for quick service. The soup broth is very good, not full of msg. It does not make you thirsty for days after consumption.  I get the small Pho and it is more than enough for me. I have never finished a bowl of pho before. 

Egg rolls are also good. Crispy hot and meaty filling with lots of lettuce and mint for wrapping. My favorite!

Potent Vietnamese ice coffee will revive you for another night of debauchery."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Consistently has great tasting Pho. I get the chicken soup with egg noodles which is loaded with flavor. Must try this location!"}
{"text":"I eat here several times a week.  Their service is great and their food is fantastic.  The restaurant is clean. I recommend everyone to at least try it once and you eill not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of friends for lunch and I was very happy. There is a parking lot and the restaurant is clean and easy. I ordered the meat and tendon pho and they do not skimp at all. The prices are very good and the service was great. I suggest coming by here if given the chance. The food is pretty good."}
{"text":"My favorites are the fried spring rolls, Pho soup, Won ton soup with egg noodles, clean and fast service. 

There are 2 downfalls which is they don't have very good vermicelli noodle bowl and no Vietnamese BBQ! 

I still rate it high for my favos!"}
{"text":"A bowl of noodles as filling and satisfying as a Thanksgiving dinner!

After spending 12 years living in Southeast Asia there is one simple meal that I miss most, a simple bowl of noodles.

Pho Saigon 8 will be my local bowl for authentic Asian noodle soup. Their noodle soups are spot on.

I had the Pho Tai Chin, rare and well cooked beef noodle soup. There are two size options, small or large for .50 cents more. The large double the size of the small and is helmet sized steaming bowl of satisfying noodle goodness. 
Before the soup arrives the server delivers the vegetable condiments that you can use to customize your bowl, don't be shy, add them all, the flavors and freshness they add lifts the noodles to a heavenly level. Also, don't forget to spice things up with a healthy squirt of Sriracha and a salty dose of hoisin sauce. There is also a wickedly delightful bowl of chili garlic sauce that adds a solid hit of heat, garlic and a touch of sour.
The rare thin sliced beef sirloin rests on top of the perfectly cooked rice noodles. Once you stir the beef into the bowl, the rare beef becomes medium well in the steaming hot broth, tender, fresh - scrumptious.
The depth of flavors is uber stimulating to the palate and the sheer volume of food is tummy satisfying. You may need a nap if you finish the whole bowl!

My wife enjoyed the Hu tieu hay Mi Dac Biet (pork soup with seafood with egg noodles). She agreed, a fantastic, tasty, satisfying bowl of noodles. The egg noodles are thin and curly. She commented that the squid was fresh and cooked perfectly.

For an authentic taste of Southeast Asia, Pho Saigon 8 can't be beat.

Their menu is extensive and includes many other non-noodle dishes that we will certainly be returning to try. We just couldn't handle anything else on top of our hot tub sized bowl of noodles!

Aloha!"}
{"text":"There service here is so very hit or miss, most of the time they ignore you and other times your food is served seconds after being seated. The place is fairly clean but the food is awful, the pho is nothing but MSG."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is alright. It's not bad but not amazing. It's right there dab in the middle It's like your usual pho place. It's located near 215 and S. Eastern near LVAC. Of the 3 or 4 other pho places in the area it's maybe my #2 or 3.  It shares the parking with a few businesses and it gets pretty busy during lunch so sometimes there aren't any parking right in front and you might have to park farther. Also getting in and out might take long.

When I come here I usually get the pho with everything except the meatballs and tripe, just not a fan of it. I think it's the #21 on the menu rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, soft tendon, skirt flank. All of that with the various veggie ingredients and sauces makes a good meal very tasty.

Services is usually good. It's cluttered near the entrance. Seat a good numbers of people. There's a sign that says $10 minimum for credit charges but noticed that they aren't always strict about that policy. 

I don't always like eating here cause sometimes it doesn't feel so clean."}
{"text":"first time at this location in a while but the food is alright but used to be WAY BETTER. first off the fat lady at the cashier that looks like a bouncer didn't refund my fathers food because it tasted weird. she was rude and had no uniform & she looked like she was from dirt ghetto Vietnam. She probably eats all the food in the kitchen. Hope she reading this cause I'll brawl out with you any day and choke you with pho broth. and what pissed me off the most was how they only gave me one fuckin piece of chicken when there should of been 2 pieces. If I see that bitch again ima punch the weight outta her"}
{"text":"I usually come to this location since they recently opened next to my favorite foot spa, Pure Foot & Spa on 215 rainbow. This location is small and offers a variety of items on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered pho that says seafood. My food came out with pork blood. I don't eat pork blood. I told the server to just put away, She rudely replied \"just removed the blood!\" and walked away. The server said that you ordered it and you pay for it. I didn't ask them not to charge me but just take away. She even argued saying \" i told you that is not good, #40 is better\" which is a lie. These kinds of people has no right to be in this business! Very very bad service, notjing doecial with food."}
{"text":"Pretty much one of the best pho I've ever had. The place is clean, good service and the food came out fast. Pho was very tasty, the beef quality is better than most places and the soup was very on point. They got one star taken out because I ordered the large and was more like between the size of regular and large. 
Price is also slightly higher than most places."}
{"text":"Never come here again.. Tried 3 fucking times already but no use. The young waitress in the front was a big ass attitude. I usually don't write a review on yelp but I had to this time. They don't clean their stuffs so becareful people."}
{"text":"Pretty average. I picked up on a Sunday evening. Had one of the beef Pho. It wasn't bad but I've certainly had better. Not a lot of flavor"}
{"text":"Dude, anything with soup/broth, noodles, and filling is always good! Ive tried several pho dishes and their spring rolls.  I'm always full with the pho.  How do they slice beef so thin?  The pho broth is everything. It ties it all in.  Pho is a PIA to make if you don't have a pressure cooker.  I can appreciate the variety and toppings of pho. I literally can eat pho everynight.  I think when winter rolls around and the next time I catch a cold, I'll see if pho can be a good alternative for chicken soup.  I've been here several times already (yet I forget to check in!!!!) and will be back again when I'm itching for some Vietnamese goodness!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. My thoughts:

My boss introduced me to this place and I thought it was okay. No complaints whatsoever but didn't think it was that great either but I thought I would go back again...but that was then. 

This is now...A friend from Reno moved to LV to study and she said she misses her pho back home so I said I'll take her to a good place so I took her here. She ordered exactly what she would order in Reno but boy was she disappointed when she tried her order. I didn't really know what the difference was compared to what she was used to but I guess it was really that bad since after having only 3 spoonfuls, she gave up to the point that she decided she didn't want to finish her food. I felt embarrassed because on our way there, I was prepping her to look forward to some awesome pho but the only thing that she had was disappointment."}
{"text":"I tried something new here. Some kind of crab soup. It was NOT good. I ended up not eating it. 

The second time I just got the pho. It was MEH. Nothing about it stuck out in my  mind. 
We came with a group of people. Two seconds after we sat down they asked Do you know what you want? Ummm, no not yet. Not more than a minute later two other servers asked us if we were ready... Ummm, could we have a little more time please?? Then when we were finally ready, we had to flag someone down. Not great customer service. They also put auto gratuity on our bill and didn't tell us so they ended up getting a double grat for not great service. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's been a while to get pho, so I went to Sigon8 with Jieun.
I didn't notice noddle portion was cut down, but bean sprout and other herb portin was cut down and they serve lemon instead of lime(I guess they have some reason).
Maybe the season matter with vegetable.....not sure.
Broth was OK as usual(I mean everybody knows every place put MSG in the broth anyway) 
I didn't try spring roll and best vietnamese coffee(my favorite) this time so maybe next time ..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it never fails me.  Their pho is seriously delicious and it's near my house!  I always order beef meatballs and fresh spring rolls with peanut butter sauce.  YUM!"}
{"text":"First time to this location.  I was very impressed.  Its very new and super clean.  Hope it stays that way.  Food was very good and seemed a bit bigger than other locations which I am definitely not complaining about.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Definitely helps that its closer to my place.  Now we don't have to drive to Chinatown to find a decent pho place."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer service worth 5 star. Pho was delicious.  The calamari was greatly seasoned and perfectly cooked. The place was clean ^-^ worth coming back! !"}
{"text":"Never again!
I was so sad to see my regular go to pho restaurant was closed today and we chose this dump out of all the other places to choose from. 
First off let me start with trying to get seated.... One guy says follow me, we start following him, then a lady stops us and says how many? Um 2..... She then tells the guy we were following and he waves come this way again. And as she turned her head she whipped my fave with her ponytail! Wtf???
We sit down and get water. We ordered hot tea and we got our appetizer before the tea. The spring rolls were not only disgustingly gross and Not fresh but the shrimp were not even cleaned! Disgusting!!!!! We got our pho and I asked to order some eggrolls since the spring rolls were nasty! Needless to say I never got my eggrolls because they never put my order in. I ended up paying $30 for the most disgusting Vietnamese food I've ever had! And our table was dirty! Sticky and dirty! The place even felt dirty! 
Do NOT go to this place, unless you like dirty shrimp, old wilted lettuce, horrible service and like dirty dining! This place should be on news for their Dirty Dining segment.... What Channel is that? I should call them!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! After flying all day we ordered take out and brought this back to our suite. We ordered a seafood and chicken pho both with yellow egg noodles. 

Portions were filling, broth was tasty. Only complaint was the containers they put them in. We both ordered the large portions and struggled mixing the meat and veggies without spilling it on the table."}
{"text":"Great pho. 
Definitely better than the rest of the pho places I have tried in Vegas, and I have been to all the Vietnamese restaurants on spring mountain rd. ( china town area). 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best viet restaurants in vegas. Reasonable prices, good service. I used to go here maybe twice a week when i lived in vegas."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and it has been great. The soup comes out fast, and it comes out good. What more could someone ask for? I normally order the tendon, and they do not disappoint. Along with the rice dish of chicken, that is one of the best on the menu in my opinion. Down a star though because service could be a bit faster when getting order to send to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is my favorite Pho shop in town. I order the same thing every time I go so my review doesn't encompass the restaurant as a whole but for a solid experience please feel free to follow my lead.

Upon walking in you will typically be greeted with \"How many?\" After they are informed of the number in your party they will typically point across the room to your table. Service is routinely cold but efficient,everything is quick, if you are not clearly asian and you order pho' expect a condescending fork to be dropped at your table.

I usually order the spring rolls and a large pho tai which is rare beef. About 1/5 of the time you will get a bowl that is lukewarm or a bowl that has sat for 1min too long making your rare beef well done by the time it arrives at your table. Its just a necessary evil of dining here. The spring rolls are light and fresh tasting made up of shrimp, noodles, herbs and served with a hoisin sauce. The Pho Tai typically has a great salty broth perfected with some siracha, jalapenos, sprouts and lime. If you want a great filling $8 meal just order the pho and you should be good to go!"}
{"text":"My two boys love this place. We always order the pho, Thai tea, and egg rolls. The service is fast, but not very friendly. It's a small restaurant with tight seating, a bit uncomfortable. The soup isn't usually hot enough to my liking, but temp is good for the kids. I hate the fact that they never bring you an itemize check, so you have to trust them. Mmmm...I don't think so! The floor is a bit slippery so don't wear your cute heels you might eat it. Also they don't have fountain soda, only cans (just saying). All in all decent restaurant, close to home, fast unfriendly service, tight seating (you might even make a new friend, not by choice), food is consistant, don't order soda (can) or drink the water (gross), have them give you and itemize check or repeat back your order when paying, if the soup isn't hot enough send it back, and wear shoes with grips so you won't fall on your ass. ENJOY! :)"}
{"text":"The pho and broth was exceptional and recommend number 18 for meat lovers. 

Disappointment was with the spring rolls and service, however the pho made up for all of that."}
{"text":"Pho phanatic here... Hands down the best pho we've eaten in Vegas (so far). We've tried many different places but nothing beats the broth here. It's the beefiest broth we've ever had. Perfect amount of noodle to meat to broth ratio. Seasoning and spices are on point. And good size portion for the price you pay. We visit Vegas at least once a year and always come back to this restaurant (and this specific location)."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely horrible. the waiters are incompetent and clueless about anything that's going on. if you go in with a party of people most of them will finish before the others food come out. in the end, this place is TRASHHHHHHHH. dont come here peeps"}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've had in Vegas. Hands down. Will be coming back next time. The beef rice plate is also good"}
{"text":"It was a decent breakfast. I had the hu tieu mi dac biet. And it tasted great. Excellent broth. I drank more liquid than eat noodles or meat. Big bowl too. I didn't finish all of it since it too big for my stomach."}
{"text":"This place is has the best PHO in Henderson. Definitely a regular"}
{"text":"In the spirit of Don King, I'll have to put up two heavyweight contenders:

Pho Saigon 8 \"I 8 pho\" vs. Pho So 1 \"yea so, we #1\" 

This is a lot like Ken vs. Ryu (Street Fighter!)... if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, than you missed out on an era of video games, and my set-up for the review was wasted because than I can't explain it to you terms of Kens flaming dragon punch vs. Ryu's flaming fireball. If you do know Street Fighter, than you'd know that I'm trying to say is that I think both restaurants are almost comparable to each other.

This is how I see how each breaks down - I order \"Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet\":

Pho So 1 - 
PRO'S:
. This is typically the place I normally go to when I'm hungover like I normally am in Vegas. Pho does a body good after drinks.
. It's clean, it's nicer looking than most Pho restaurants, and it's usually packed...most often with some hotties.
. They have an extensive menu
. huge parking lot
. Catch up on finding a real estate agent because they advertise in the menu.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants I've been too.
CON'S:
. Mediocre pho broth. Can sometimes taste like beef broth in a can. The 99.8% fat free kind. Come on! Fat is flavor!
. Service??
. Get distracted by look'n at the menu cuz a bunch of real agents advertise in the menu.

Pho Saigon 8
PRO'S
. Pho broth is slightly better than So #1
. Won numerous awards in several publications for best Pho/Vietnamese restaurant.
. My friend \"Double D\" says this is her favorite place, and she's a local.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants.
. The #8 is a goodluck number to Asians. Esp, Asians who gamble.
CON'S
. Smaller parking lot
. The day we went they forgot about our drink order.
. Older and less appealing interior
. $7 freak'n dollars for a LARGE bowl which isn't any bigger than So #1's large bowl of Pho. In fact, I think it's slightly smaller.
. My boba in my Thai Ice tea was like rubber pellets.
. It's located further west on Spring Mountain than So #1

It's almost a toss up, but I'd have to give it up to Pho So #1 mainly because it's more convenient, and it's a slightly better value than #8 regardless of taste."}
{"text":"You know... I've tried a lot of Pho restaurants in Vegas but none of them has really blown me away. Much like this place... it was okay... got my fix and that was that. 

They really maximized their space though, I felt like I was eating with a group of 50. Mediocre service, price, quality... abundance of parking."}
{"text":"The spicy pork noodle soup was amazing here.  They were very generous with the sliced pork and the pork blood was fresh and silky, which is usually so hard to find since places always overcook it =T  The slice of pork leg was cooked perfectly, it wasn't too soft and it wasn't too chewy.  It had just the right amount of give...mmmmmm I can't believe how many good Vietnamese places are in Vegas =d"}
{"text":"Stopped by this pho restaurant before driving home. We were seated right away and the food was amazing. Reminded me of the pho and Asian food back home! I recommend anyone that's craving asian food to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say Pho Saigon's broth is the best flavored pho in the southwest. We'll definitely be returning here during the days we don't feel like cooking or when we just need that bowl of quick pho fix. 

My husband ordered a large pho tai nam, and I ordered the small #20. The bowls had tons of meat. I feel like I usually don't have enough meat to noodle ratio at other places. We also ordered the Chinese sausage fried rice for the kids. That was really delicious, all of my kids approve!! 

One star off because a few of the utensils they gave us were dirty. They had residual smear marks on the soup spoons and regular silver spoon. Also, when we asked for a box to take our left over fried rice, the guy was looking another direction while handing the box to my husband. It was kind of funny, but since he wasn't paying attention, he almost hit my husband in the face with the box hahaha. My husband was so annoyed but I thought it was funny. Please just pay attention to who or where you're handing something to."}
{"text":"Very good service... excellent food... very clean environment...not expensive... large menu to choose from... beer and wine available... and dessert"}
{"text":"So happy about this new SW side location, the best Pho in town is now just minutes away instead of driving to China Town. Order the egg rolls, pho with brisketanf shrimp fried rice!!! All of it is amazing and authentic. The Avocado smoothie with boba is a delicious sweet dessert!! 
So happy to have this in the neighborhood!!!
The staff is super attentive and there to please."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese restaurant. Seating for large groups and tables for two.

Service 4/5 

Food 5/5

Price 5/5

I came with some family visiting from out of town and they were able to accommodate a party of seven easily. We ordered pho with beef and variety meat bowls (6) of them, the grilled chicken with rice and 6 egg rolls. There was plenty of plates of toppings for the pho including bean sprout, limes and mint. The fish sauce for the chicken and the egg rolls was also tasty. I mixed up some hoisin sauce and Sriracha to dip the egg rolls in. The chicken was tender and seasoned well.

The bill came out and most dishes were about $10. Very reasonable for the price since all the bowls of pho were large. 

Definitely one of my favorite pho restaurants in Las Vegas. Of course I will come back again."}
{"text":"6 years ago this pho spot was great, the broth was rich and flavorful but I came back last week to Vegas and it was average at best."}
{"text":"Only got 3 stars because even tho the Pho was awesome, I ordered and paid for Spring Rolls, but when I got home they weren't in the bag :( I wasn't driving all the way back during rush hour to get them. Plus my Pho would get cold.   Next time I'll check the bag before I leave."}
{"text":"Ordered #70 Vermicelli noodles with shrimp, pork and egg roll. Portion of noodles/meat/veggies were pretty even all around. Cooked hot & fresh.

My dad ordered #35 soup. Not sure what it was but he said he really liked the taste of it. Tangy with lots of meat!"}
{"text":"This is Carla M.'s favorite pho joint in Vegas. It was a no-brainer that I had to try it out when I was in town visiting her. To be quite honest, I've never had bad pho. How can you screw it up?! Pho Saigon 8 did not disappoint. I wouldn't say it's the best pho I've had, because I really can't taste the difference. It's all the same to me.

Service was very good, fast and easy. They have plenty of options to choose from. Portions are decent for the price. Everyone was very friendly. The restaurant was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Good as usual.  Broth is not fatty and the meats are really tasty.  Their noodles are the thinner kind but very good.  Get the #16 for a nice combination. The regular size is $7.55 and they want a little over 8 bux for the large. Do the math.  I held one star back because the large isn't really that large."}
{"text":"It's not the best pho I've had but it's still good. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come eat here though. If I'm around the neighborhood, then why not but it's not something I'm crazy about."}
{"text":"Late night eats available here until midnight except Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday only open till 11PM.

After looking the menu over we ordered the Beef broth pho with steak, delicious noodle and tasty broth 5/5. And the chicken breast rice plate with soup 4/5. Tasty chicken flavored well and some fish sauce to dip it in. 

For dessert we chose the Suong Sa Hat Luu, which is tapioca jelly with green bean paste and coconut milk, 5/5!

Very clean new restaurant and good service 5/5. Will be back again when we need our Pho fill..."}
{"text":"Party all night? Hungover in the AM? You've arrived at your cure. A short trip from all the bright lights. I found out about this place from my GF and hot damn if it isn't one of the better pho places around Vegas. 

When you arrive the parking lot has ample spaces for you to park. Walk into the restaurant and you are hit with the scent of pho all over and you'll feel your hangover start to subside. Their iced coffee with milk is awesome as well. It's the old school drip style that drips into a glass with a layer of condensed milk at the bottom. When the coffee finishes, pick up the strainer and be hit with this aroma of some good coffee and you'll feel awake before the coffee even touches your lips. If you want to feed our hangover they also have a small selection of beer as well.

They have all the standard fare pho and dark/white meat chicken pho which is just as good as the beef. Regular or large bowls are available. If you're feeling rice they also have that along with other standard apps like spring/egg rolls which are just as good.

The only dessert I ever get at Vietnamese restaurants is Che Ba Mau...if you don't know you're missing out. Their Che Ba Mau is ok but nothing really to write home about. It's a good finisher if you've still got room for it at the end of the meal.

My only gripe with this place, which is only because when I'm full I feel pretty lazy, is that you have to walk up to the register to pay for your meal. I think of it as a good thing though because you're forced to get up and move after you eat a good meal instead of vegeing out while you wave your hand up to get *makes writing check motion* the check."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho restaurant and I am southeast Asian. Much cleaner than the \"other\" pho places. Spacious and good service. I like the sausage in the spring roll. The portions are large for pho."}
{"text":"The pho here is great! The food is served fast and is always tasty. They have a wide selection of pho and other authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Vegas! I know it 2 years ago and still the same feeling about it. Great job for keeping it up with your service."}
{"text":"Disclaimer- The food is definitely four stars, but the service is one to two stars depending on the day. Therefore, I'm giving Pho Saigon 8 an overall rating of three stars.

My mom and I have been coming to Pho Saigon 8 since my family first moved to the valley, almost four years ago, and the customer service over the years has just gotten progressively worse. The staff was great when we first started coming here and then as of lately, the staff has just been rude and unpleasant to be served by. Although this restaurant is not close to home, we still drive the distance when we have that craving! We used to come at least once a week, but now every other month or so.

We usually come for lunch on the weekend, so it's always busy during that time. The wait time can be a hit or miss.

I am a creature of habit and order the same exact thing every time. I order the #11 (Pho Tái) which is the broth, noodles, and rare eye round. As far as the pho goes, the broth is always hot and never warm like other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. It's rich in flavor and there is a good amount of rice noodles in the soup. I love the rare eye round because it's not fatty. A plate of garnishes are provided for the table to share. The traditional Thai basil, jalapeños, lime, and my favorite, crunchy bean sprouts. I love my pho with extra lime, and if more garnishes are needed, you can always ask for more! You might have to ask more than once though because they can be quite forgetful. Also, condiments are a must! A nice squeeze of Sriracha and Hoisin always go into my pho.

If I'm hungrier than usual, I'll order a plate of the crispy fried egg rolls to share. The crispy fried spring rolls are a favorite amongst my family! There are four per order and it comes with four leaves of fresh lettuce as well as the dipping sauce. I'm not too sure what the dipping sauce is made of, but it's delicious! The spring rolls are filled with pork and a variety of veggies.

Overall, the best place for pho in the Henderson area! The food is great and satisfies my craving every time. The service isn't the best, but it'll do."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Pho and rice dishes. The egg rolls are decent. The taste is consistent so we usually alternate btwn this pho place and another one way up the street."}
{"text":"I had a bowl of beef pho tonight from Pho Saigon 8.  I'm no expert on pho, but I just wasn't all that impressed!  The broth of the pho was just ok.  I thought it was a little weak (Thai food has ruined my pallet though).  My favorite pho spot has a lot more richness to it.  The side veggies were fresh and good for the most part, however they did skimp on the amount given.  I ordered a side of vinegar onions, and they were pretty flavorless.  All that aside, I liked it!  

Combined with the fact the service was pretty unfriendly, and the pho wasn't any better than a couple of other spots I've been to in town, I probably won't be going back.  2.5 stars and rounded up to 3 stars for the overall experience, I guess."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were on a birthday trip to Vegas when we decided to get some pho and asked several dealers and bartenders at MGM Grand where we could find a good place.  We got several recommendations and we couldn't decide, so we randomly picked a place.  Luckily we picked Pho Saigon 8.  We were seated right away and by the owner no less.  We ordered the following: egg rolls, spring rolls, 2 special pho bowls, 1 cubed tender beef dish, and 1 rice with grilled pork.  The egg rolls and the spring rolls were pretty standard for vietnamese apps, although the dipping sauce for the spring rolls was better than usual.  The bowls of pho were good and the pieces of meat were generous.  The beef dish had such tender big chunks of meat that were cooked to perfection.  The pork dish was standard, but tasty nontheless.  This was a welcomed escaped from the over priced food and buffetts on the strip.  Total bill was around $50 for 4 of us and my favorite part of the meal was my green soy milk, mm mm sooo good.  I highly recommend this place to any wary travelor to Vegas.  Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Sat for 10 mins. Finally flagged server down and he took our order. 5 mins later and I still dont have a beer. They were in the weeds busy but kept seating the door for some reason. Got up and left..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today during work.  Place was pretty packed for a Monday afternoon.  I had a bowl a pho since this is how I measure the restaurant.  I ordered a coke and a glass of water.  Never got my water.  Waitress never returned to check on me.  Now for the pho.  The broth lacked flavor.  It was bland and lacked rich broth I look for.  I've had much better.  Also, the large is probably a medium bowl in most places.  Pretty disappointed w/ the food considering the high rating."}
{"text":"I'm glad I tried Pho Saigon 8.  I ordered the pho with round, flank and meatball, but asked to replace the flank with brisket, and I'm not sure which I got, but it was inedible -- way too fatty and chewy.  Luckily, there were only 2 small slices of it, and plenty of the other 2 meats, so now I know -- next time I'll stick with the round and meatballs. 
 The basil and sprouts that came with the pho were THE FRESHEST I've seen at any pho restaurant, with no brown spots on the basil, and no yellow tinge on the sprouts.  I started with the BBQ pork rolls, which are like spring rolls but with pork instead of shrimp.  At first, I thought the meat was Spam, but it wasn't salty enough, more like thick bologna.  I've had pork rolls elsewhere where the meat was recognizable.  The peanut sauce for the rolls was thin, and not as flavorful as I'd like.  I tried a drink made of raw egg white, seltzer and condensed milk, and it was delicious.  The staff was good -- some were friendly and others were serious, but the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Gotta admit, saw this place on dirty dining but their food is soooo delicious!

I still go here regardless.

I love their pho as welll as their dry noodles. For the life of me, I can't think of the name of the dry noodles! Lol anyway, I also love their crispy egg rolls. So delicious and cheap!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I would never go to this place ever again. The waitress/host was so rude. She got an attitude when I asked nicely for a high hair then ignored our table for 15 mins and never bothered to even come take our orders. We got up and walked out. Worst service I've ever had.  I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone ."}
{"text":"I went here to try to find an authentic version of a vietnamese curry chicken dish i had at TI's Pho restaurant.

I ordered a chicken noodle Pho and a curried chicken over rice dish, the latter of the two dishes being awesome, sweet and and just the right amount of spicy. Generous large portions reasonably priced. It was my first time trying Pho, which was a  huge soup with everything in it but the kitchen sink. It was good, not amazing but good.

Also ordered a weird drink, it was like a strawberry shake but had these weird balls inside of it that were hard to suck up a straw also this weird texture once in your mouth...felt like I was chewing on an eyeball or something, weird .

I'd try this place again and maybe get a little more adventurous with my Pho selection next time. Nix the drink though."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good. After eating on the strip for the past several meals a bowl of authentic pho noddles was exactly what I needed. Soup base had a lot of flavor and the pho noddles had great texture. Minus one star because their \"large\" is extremely small. I had to order two large bowls just for myself."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR PHO IN LAS VEGAS. Don't be fooled, they have another location on Spring Mtn Road in Chinatown, but this location in Henderson is much better.

For me pho comes down to 4 things. 
1. the soup. 
2. the noodles
3. the meat
4. cleanliness

The soup here is real, some places try to cut corners by not using real stock, they go with the \"gaijing\" or chicken/pork base, this saves hours of prep and time (and is cheaper) but the taste isn't there. If you want to know if real stock is being used, take a cup full home, put it in the fridge and if it has fat settled on the top in form of white dots, its the real deal. THIS PLACE USES REAL STOCK AND THE FLAVOR IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.

The noodles here are good, they don't give you a ton, so if you are a big eater like myself you can order extra, or load up on the sprouts and basil. I am 6'4 and push 300 lbs, this place fills me up with out extra noodles, mainly due to the generous portion of meat.

The meat here is perfect. IT IS CUT THIN!!! There are so many pho places that simply slice their meat too thick and it tastes chalky and hard to digest. Here they do it perfect. The rare eye of the round, brisket and fatty brisket are perfect. I get the #18 that comes with all the above with tendon and tripe.

You can tell this place is well taken care of. The hoisin sauce bottle is clean, the hot sauce container doesnt have 3 week old hot sauce jerky hanging from it (foodies will know what i mean) and the place is decorated nicely, service is fast and nice.

We live 2 mins from Chinatown but will travel 30 mins to Henderson to eat here. BEST PLACE FOR PHO IN LAS VEGAS, HANDS DOWN."}
{"text":"i've tried a lot of pho places here in the vegas area and i must say pho saigon 8 henderson location is so convenient being away from the strip. shrimp spring rolls with no pork, is great with peanut sauce and a hint of sriracha sauce. they taste so fresh compared to other places. i get chicken vermicelli and i love it. but (-1 star) for their service, they can work on smiling and refilling water faster."}
{"text":"Me and my sister went and got a massage and was craving for pho and this is the closest one.
The pho is just ok, not very flavorful even after i put some sauce in it. We were still eating but theyre already cleaning the place throwing you with \"hurry up\" look. I asked for thai tea with no boba but they still gave me the boba. My sister said her durian boba is tasteless. Not gonna come back."}
{"text":"Terrible, Awful, Craptastic, and Sh*talicious are the best words I can come up with to describe this absolute dump of a restaurant. Our order was taken by the rudest little b*tch east of Saigon. This old jabba the hutesque looking troll continuously gave us dirty look after dirty look.  We ordered 2 different bowls of pho and an appetizer of deep fried Vietnamese egg rolls. The egg rolls were actually pretty good, however the pho was terrible.  Trust me people I am well versed in the world of pho and when I say it sucks, it sucks. The broth was the most uneventful bland liquid I've tasted in a while.  I shouldn't need to continuously doctor up my pho by adding ingredient after ingredient to provide my taste buds with the slightest resemblance of flavor.  

Ok so the food sucked. Fare enough, lets leave.  Easy feet to accomplish right...wrong.  God forbid you get somebody to acknowledge you after your food has arrived.  Just getting someone to look in you general direction so you can flag them down is like pulling teeth.  Crap food, terrible service, grumpy employees. One star is one to many."}
{"text":"I am always pleased and quite full when I leave here.  Don't bother with Pho Mailan up the street, you can read my post about them as to why.  It's better than Lemongrass which is almost across the street.
As for the people whose problem with this place is service....  In my not-so-humble opinion, crappy service is quite common in southeast Asian cuisine restaurants.  Many seem to lack any personality, and any server etiquette.  Same applies here.  But the food is consistently great and I've never been let down."}
{"text":"This is the only Vietnamese restaurant I have eaten at in Vegas, and I was thorougly satisfied with the food.  Relaxed atmosphere, great place to bring kids, but the tables are a bit too cramped in places.

We've had both the chicken as well as various beef pho, and it was all excellent.  Great broth!  Mmmmmmmmmmm.  The spring rolls were very tastey as well."}
{"text":"This place is actually alittle bit better than Pho So #1 but of course not better than the ones in San Jose!

Pros: Pho is decent, nice servers

Cons: Pho bowls is alittle small, alittle pricey

Overall great place to try out if you havent."}
{"text":"So yum. Always busy and service is good. Have only had spring rolls and Pho. Happy girl."}
{"text":"Quick service, large portion sizes, relatively clean, good desserts, decent prices.  The flavor of pho was good but a little on the blander side, but I actually prefer it that way because I don't feel like I ate a boullion cube with the pho soup.  I was really impressed by the clean bean sprouts. My family and I eat a lot of pho at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants and this is only the second time ever that the bean sprouts came with the root ends plucked off."}
{"text":"While traveling around spring road near Las Vegas, I stumbled upon this pho vietnamese restaurant that was recommended to me from a local. He said this place was the best he tried and he went to most of the places on this road. Let me tell you, there are plenty of other choices for Vietnamese restaurants around. I definitely took his word for it because he's a crazy foodie who loves to eat. 

Inside, it is ambient. The waiters and waitresses are Vietnamese and the service quality is excellent. The inside is decorated with Vietnamese culture and is clean. The pictures on the menu look better than the food themselves, but the fresh taste of ingredients is definitely there. 

 The food is very cheap, I would wager based on the pictures I've posted, everything is about 10$ ish and lower. The appetizer I ordered is the spring roll and it was immaculate. 

The parking outside is full and hard to fill probably because this place is so good!!!! The outside is hot and surrounded by other small restaurants on a large open road. 

 If you are wondering if it is noisy inside, it is peaceful. The desserts here are very cheap, 3$ and below. The smell of the food is just mind blowing, and the service is about 10 minutes of waiting. The drinks come out fast, less than a minute and refills are also quick. 

In the end, if you love Vietnamese food, this place is top of the line in quality, service and price. The meal I had was a tofu and vermicelli combo. The other ordered item was a grilled shrimp and vermicelli. The only Con is nothing. I highly recommend this place if you are hungry and want to give Vietnamese food a chance. One of the best Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time here recommended by my sister who frequently goes here .. great for a first impression. Great service, friendly staff, and food was out on our table within minutes, plus the place was packed!! Great food! Well recommended!!"}
{"text":"LIke I've said..I only eat here when my BF wants his Beefstew pho! 

Service is not that great. I don't know if its just the way they staff it. Then the pho wasn't great today. Not tasty and a lot less noodles. Some days I'll have too much."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy Phò!  The broth is amazing. I usually always get the #11.  The \"add in's\" are always super fresh and fragrant and they serve  very generous portions.  

The soup comes in two sizes, they just have the price for the large size in the menu, you need to ask for a small if you want that.  

My friend introduced me about a month ago, and I have been back 3 times already.  You could say it's my new favorite.

The service is very fast, but strictly business.  Never anyone rude or unhelpful, but not warm or inviting really either.  But seriously I couldn't care less the soup is amazing and I don't necessarily care for overly talkative waiters anyhow."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. We've ventured out to most Vietnamese places in town but the pho doesn't really compare elsewhere. The rice dishes are also very good. You can't really judge Asian restaurants on their service so don't expect much. If you want something just ask until you get it."}
{"text":"Driving up and down Spring Mountain, you'll have your endless pick of Pho places. We stopped here based on a friend's recommendation. The restaurant is moderately sized with as many tables cramped into the room as possible. And you can tell that this is a genuine Vietnamese restaurant based on the service. You're never quite sure who your server is so you just flag down whoever walks by. You're also expected to know what you want to order within 3 minutes of sitting down. However the service is fast and the food is delicious. Either way, it's a nice little joint where you can chow down away from the strip. Pho-Sho!"}
{"text":"I'm from southern californa, and I'm vietnamese so I think I've had my fair share of \"authentic\" vietnamese food, and I think Pho Saigon 8 does a pretty good job. And for a decent price too! 

I've gotten the Pho Bo Vien (meat ball Pho) which was good. The broth was a good flavor. I always add tons of lemon and Hoisin Sauce anyway. 

And I've had their Rice platter with grilled pork (Thit Nuong) and egg rolls. I thought the meat was awesome. It had a good flavor and the egg rolls were pretty good too. My one complaint is that the rice wasn't your typical \"broken rice\" where the rice pieces are smaller. They served whole rice grains, which is fine but I was really looking foward to the traditional Com Tam.

My fiance has gotten their Bun Thit Nuong (Dry noodle bowl with grilled pork) and he didn't have any complaints. The fish sauce (Nuoc Mam) was decent, nothing too spectacular. 

And the service isn't too bad either. I've gone when they've been pretty busy and I thought the service was moderately attentive. Overall this is a great place to go when you're craving a nice steaming bowl of noodle soup or just some good ole vietnamese food and you're too lazy to drive down to Spring Mountain haha."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 has always been one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants to eat at. So happy they opened one up by our house. We always get the same every time, husband gets pho dac biet, spring rolls, egg rolls, and my favorite bun bo hue. It's always on point, the service is on point, and it's clean. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My go-to pho place in town! Pho Saigon 8 serves the best pho in the area hands down, and I've gone to quite a few of the other Vietnamese restaurants in town to find the perfect place. I'm from Orange County where there is some of the best pho restaurants you can find, so my standards were pretty high when I went on this search. Trust me when I say the best is here. 

The wait staff is friendly and the food comes out super duper quick. They are always pretty busy but I have never had to wait for a table to be available. 

The only fall back is that you are going be in close proximity to those around you, whether it be at your table or the table next to you. The tables feel kind of small and you have to be mindful when maneuvering around so you don't knock into other people... but this is a small price to pay! And speaking of price, the dishes are very affordable :)"}
{"text":"Soup is ultra salty .  Good portion of food thought ..ok   acceptable .    Casual lunch"}
{"text":"Ughhh nothing worse than half ass food. I had the pho here before but today I ordered the grilled chicken with rice. Needless to say... I will never order that again. Strictly only pho here."}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly servers, nice presentation, reasonably priced for its huge portion. However, food is salty and lacking taste. Noodles taste pre-packaged. At least from what I ordered - number 38 on the menu - crispy noodles or Hong Kong style fried noodles. The hubs said his combination pho is good. He likes this place because they serve good pho. I guess I should have ordered pho. The place is easy access from Spring Mountain, ample parking, clean, but always jam packed."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch!  The service is quick, the food is relatively fast and always tastes great!  I stopped in for a late lunch (closer to 2 or 2:30pm), and it wasn't busy at all.  During peak lunch rush there can be a wait.

The menu has lots to choose from.  I've gotten into the habit of getting the same things each time I go - but otherwise I'd say try something new once in a while.

The atmosphere is very casual.  Great food!"}
{"text":"Amazing as usual! I go to this Pho spot after every EDC the AC is blasting and the food is great. Recovery to the fullest"}
{"text":"Maybe not the best PHO I've had but definitely decent and worth trying! I'll be frequenting this joint for take-out since it satisfies my cravings for Vietnamese food. The place itself is very clean, modern, and service is pretty darn good. It's a comfortable environment and it's not in Spring Mountain mixed in the cluster of Asian restaurants. That's a plus! Oh, and the menu is pretty comprehensive so you'll find something!"}
{"text":"So me and my friends were in Vegas and getting broke so a bowl of pho sounded like a good decently priced meal. We get here at 9:30pm and its packed. We waited 5 minutes and were seated and I ordered my usual Pho Dac Biet, beef noodles with everything. Their broth was really good with not much oil which is surprising. The noodles were cooked perfectly, not too soft with a bit of bite left to them. The meat was also cooked well, the tai, raw meat, was really tender. The gan, tendon (my personal favorite), was also nice and soft. I wish they had culantro but at least they had limes, basil, jalepenos and bean sprouts which is a must. My friend got the Goi Cuon, the summer rolls, and they looked pretty good with the shrimp and pork. The cafe den da and sua da, iced coffee with sugar or milk, was definitely strong and kept me up which was the point. When I come to vegas again I definitely will come again and try their Banh Canh, thick rice starch noodles, with either the traditional shrimp and pork hocks or the thick orange soup with crab."}
{"text":"I stopped by to get some take out. Here's what I got:

* #61- Bún Bo Nuong Sa ($7.50) -it was a large portion of lemongrass beef. The beef was lean with very little fat; tender and flavorful.
* #71 - Bún Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.75) - excellent  grilled pork and there was plenty of it. I wasn't crazy about the egg rolls. The wrappers were thicker and not as crispy as I would have liked.

While the food was very good, the service (even for takeout) wasn't. No eye contact, no smiles, no \"thanks for stopping by, come again.\" The old guy behind the counter was just plain grumpy and seemed like I was an inconvenience to him. Call me crazy, but good customer service is important to me. I'd rather go some place that appreciates my business, like Bosa 1."}
{"text":"It was an easy fix for PHO off of the S. Rainbow Area. One of my favorite appetizers/starters at a Vietnamese Restaurant is Spring Rolls and I wasn't all that impressed with them it had more lettuce then noodles or anything else. The service was not the greatest either considering there was only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant, they were extremely slow taking our order, getting our drinks and our bill. However we enjoyed the egg rolls and the Pork & Shrimp Vermicelli very much"}
{"text":"Pros: This place has great beef tenderloin, I highly recommend eaters to get #59. You can either get steamed or French rice and a side of sliced carrots and a piece of cabbage. They also served me a cup of soup which was delicious!!! 
Cons: You're forced to be seated next to people you don't know and you're also forced to share the siracha/hoisin sauce with them. I would prefer that they separate the tables for some privacy. They're not that quick to fill up water. They ended up filling my drink towards the end but I would still like to have the water throughout my meal. 

Overall great place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pho spot. I always order the small #7, which is just pho with the rare flank. I get my pho pretty basic since I don't like all that meat. Their rice dishes are pretty solid too. The BBQ pork is really flavorful and tender, even when you eat it the next day as left overs. Not a huge fan of their service. The couple times I've been here, the servers speak little English. And when we went to go up and pay, the cashier asked what table were sitting in. Um, I didn't know that I was in charge of knowing my table #. I went there to have dinner, not get quizzed. Plus there were only 3 other tables that were occupied. Do you not know who is in your dining room?! Ok that's my rant. Otherwise I'll be back for more pho."}
{"text":"It's great pho, and the service is quick and smooth. I've come here a couple times and every time has been very pleasant. It's comfort comfort food for me, so it is nice to come someplace welcoming and with good food."}
{"text":"the pho here is pretty good almost comparable to the pho places in rosemead back in good ol SGV.  Been coming here to get my pho fix while I'm in vegas but thats it. Food is consistent and done very well but for some careful on the off days and that's why the 1 star off"}
{"text":"I only give 2 star because this place's food is average. Service is HORRIBLE. Me and my mom came in and stood there stupidly for at least 5 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) and this old lady who work there waved me off when I put up two fingers of table for two. She looked so pissed and grouchy and she literally gave me a mean look when she waved me off. That was extremely rude and I did not come to this place for this kind of service, and certainly no matter how good the food it doesn't keep me coming back for this service."}
{"text":"Went here over Memorial day weekend and I was not impressed.  It was dinner and the place was not super busy but they messed up our table's order and were not ver accomodating.  I ordered Com Ga Roti, which I've eaten at a lot of Viet places.  This was the worse.  The hen is supposed to be crispy but mine appeared to be boiled or steamed with a lot of soy sauce dumped on it.  And for whatever reason, there were a lot of 'eggroll warpper' flakes all over the chicken."}
{"text":"I would never ever come back to this place ever again and it was my first time here. I wish there was a way to rate this place 0 stars. They're customer service sucks. They never came to check on us so I never got a chance to tell them that the broth sucks and that the noodles they gave me were broken into pieces. They tried to tell me that it was cause it's been sitting in the broth for too long. How is that even possible when they just brought out my pho. I told the \"Guy\" in charge and he made it seem like I didn't know what I was talking about. I was simply just letting them know that I didn't like it it wasn't cause I wasn't trying to pay. They were very rude about acknowledging the issue. DONT COME HERE even the spring rolls were tough!!! I didn't even get an apology"}
{"text":"This is the best pho in town. Their broth is always on point! Service is fast, even when it gets busy. The quality of foods is always high. Prices are a little higher than others but it's definitely worth it! If you're looking for good quality pho, this is definitely the spot"}
{"text":"My go to spot for Pho noodle. The food is hot and delicious!!! Try the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Everything is great and beyond my expectation for Vietnamese food in Vegas. Their pho is yummy and the vegetable is always fresh especially the bean sprout. I definitely recommend to try other food such as egg-roll or udon, you will be surprise how good their food is. Thumb up for the service!"}
{"text":"Great Pho place by 215 and Rainbow, same plaza as Einstein Bagel and the 7 eleven.
I was reading reviews about Pho over the weekend and this one guys, because of your reviews... made me think pho pho pho lol
Took my friend there for a quick lunch today. Place is clean. It was busy. As soon i walked in the waiver found is a table and iced water was served right away without us asking.
Service was fast and good.
i ordered pho meat ball (of course) and we ordered beef luc lac. My pho broth was delicious and very tasty. I ate it all and even drink all the broth LOL
the Beef luc loc is accompanied by a bowl of broth (nice)
the beef luc lac comes with steamed rice or tomato rice. Never had that before, the rice was so so Good! I was looking around what people ordered ... PHO PHO PHO so i will have to come back and order other dish and try it all!
$24 lunch for 2
I will happily go eat there again :) 
they open from 10:30am to midnight!!! is that awesome??"}
{"text":"Easily Pho-gotten Experience

Can't really comment on the sister restaurant in Spring Mountain, but I stopped by here since I currently reside on the east part of town and I wanted to check out the Las Vegas Athletic Club located not far behind.

A good way to judge a Vietnamese restaurant is the quality of the their beef pho broth.  While I was fairly hungry having scheduled a late lunch, I was both delighted and simultaneously skeptical regarding the fact that my steaming bowl of beef pho with flank steak and tendon came within 2 minutes of placing my order.  One of my Vietnamese friends taught me some easy signs to spot a good broth are through sight and smell prior to tasting.  One should detect an immediate aroma upon the bowl being placed at your table and I'm not sure if that was the case.  The clarity of the broth both in term of being able to visualize the ingredients and the absence of an abundance of oil at the surface also is a positive sign and this broth appeared to pass the sight test. 

Poking my chopsticks around followed by adding the standard sides (sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil), I began to slurp and taste.  The noodles were the right texture and not overly clumped together, although this can be the most forgivable fault if all else is right.  The meat was problematic in that the thin slices were clumped together like miniature meat softballs and the only way of preventing any undercooked areas would be to OVERCOOK the whole mass.  Anthony Bourdain once commented in his book Kitchen Confidential that one should never order steak well done since you will likely get the worst cut of meat available since one cannot tell the difference between the best and worst when it is well done.  I feel the same holds true when you are trying to assess the quality of the thinly sliced beef in one's pho.  The tendon was actually the star in that they were sliced with a good combination of collagenous goodness and the occasional hint of meat and cooked to perfection. 

 Last but not least, the broth is what makes or breaks the dish, and in this case, my nose trumped my eyes in that the taste of the broth was fairly one-dimensional.   The broth is usually a matter of pride amongst Vietnamese moms and no two are alike since hours to days are spent perfecting the signature combination of beef bones, ginger, onion, and aromatics (cinnamon, anise. cloves, peppercorns, etc) guarded in households much like the Colonel Sanders' original recipe.  I could barely detect anything beyond a mild sweetness which could have been MSG or a bouillion cube (we'll see how thirsty I am a few hours from writing this review).  I am probably being overcritical since I have had some great broths in the past, so I will say that much like the clientele which was mostly of mixed caucasian/asian couples, this place would be a great primer for someone new to pho since I would think perhaps the addition of the other subtle flavors may weird out the newcomers and sometimes one has to sample an average broth to appreciate an excellent broth.  

P.S.  Probably the only pet peeve of mine is avoid taking home noodle soups unless you plan on consuming them later that night.  It is a food crime to eat them as leftovers when the noodles have had a chance to get soggy and release their starches and muddle the broth."}
{"text":"Delicious Banh Canh with fresh crabs, totally worth it. Open at 9am perfect for breakfast before heading to your next destination.

They even have legit cafe fin, which drips before your eyes. A must try if you want to stay awake all day :]"}
{"text":"Pho broth clean, not oily, full flavored - beautiful broth. 

Very generous with their meats in the pho - I couldn't even finish a small bowl. I got the combo with tendon, flank, eye of round, etc. What I love about their pho is that they aren't afraid to give you fat. A little fat on the meats is a wonderful thing, especially since the broth is so light.

Restaurant very clean and tidy."}
{"text":"The pho was really yummy, it was our first time there.  We had the #18 with two orders of spring rolls. Since it was on the way to our doctors office, we decided to check it out. The atmosphere was good, the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Been coming here for years . Great and nice people . Never rude nor rude comments . Favorite place !"}
{"text":"I have ate at pho Saigon 8 twice in the last 2 months. Great service and tasty food.  I had the #16 which was really good."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is great!! I've read some reviews and never experienced any of what people are posting. Try them for yourselves."}
{"text":"A family friend referred Pho Saigon 8 as \"The Best Vietnamese Food in Town.\"  Since we were in the area, we decided to give the pho a try.  To my taste buds, pho has to be piping hot.  Lukewarm soup does not make me happy.  In fact, it ruins the whole meal.  I ordered Pho Tai and I didnt observe any steam coming out of my medium sized bowl.  The meat was fresh and not tough at all.  The egg rolls were eh."}
{"text":"Funny story: so apparently people still go by word of mouth and not by yelp, but my dad was obsessed with finding a \"Pho Saigon 88\" because his friend had been there and thought it was amazing. We drove all the way down spring mountain road trying to find this non-existent place and all the while passing perfectly good korean, chinese, japanese, and other pho places! i was starving and getting angry until my parents were like \"hmm...do you think its 8 and not 88? i don't know...lets do it!\" so we finally stop and eat! 

the restaurant is clean and pleasantly decorated. I loved the pho bo's soup, tasty and steaming wth good pho-ness. I give it a 3 because the meat had a meaty smell, not a tasty beef smell, and my dad's bun bo hue (usually a favorite) didn't have the spice it should have."}
{"text":"Pho was delicious.  Taste like the pho Saigon in Sacramento.  The beef was very flavorful and you must try the colorful dessert.  It's so good."}
{"text":"Small and cozy place to eat with low light setting.
I was happy with the food that we order. I got \"com suong bi cha thit nuong\" which is not bad. My friends say the pho is good too. Would come back."}
{"text":"I love that this place is open late.  On my recent visit I was stopping by for take out.  The employee at the register was friendly, patient, and eager to make suggestions.  After I ordered they even offered me iced water in a to-go cup while I wait. I ordered pho among other things and it was well packaged and I had no spills in the car.  

I enjoyed their meatball pho, seafood flat noodles, and chicken porridge."}
{"text":"pretty good vietnamese food here.  pho is done well but seems to be heavy on the msg side.  best thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours and a short drive from the strip."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for Pho. The amount of meat they give you beats any other I've ever had. The broth is great. Perfect for anything that ails you!"}
{"text":"Right next to BBQ king, pretty big inside and the pho is delicious. Service isn't the best, but they get the job done. Kind of pricey though. Plus I feel the need to drink a lot of water a couple hours later."}
{"text":"Based on my friend's suggestion that \"the noodle soup was to die for\", I decided to check out this place as part of my montly book club meeting.  Walking in, the place is exactly what you'd expect of a restaurant located in Vegas' version of China town: neon flourescent lighting; no-nonsense tables and chairs; and a statute of a laughing Buddha set in front of a bamboo screen. 

Admittedly, you don't come to Saigon 8 for its fantastic decor.

However, where the place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in a great meal for a steal! We started with their veggie spring rolls, which were perfect -- not too oily but just enough crunch -- and  accompanied by a fantastic brown sauce.  No sooner had we finished washing down the spring rolls with Soda Chanh (Fresh lime soda), servers were clearing away the appetizer plates to make room for the star of the show: steaming pho in a delicious broth, accompanied by the classic pho condiments (cut jalapeno peppers, bean sprouts and fresh Basil). In one word: yum.  And, when we found that the bill for 7 people came to just under $90 -- double yum! I heartily recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm not quite sure why they have such low reviews because they are BANGIN'. 

Anyways, their broth is delicious and always piping hot, noodles are always al dente and chewy. The only complaint I have is that they don't always have the best service. But when they do, OH MAN. 

If you do get a chance to come here, ORDER THE FRIED EGGROLLS. They are super crispy, crunchy, and always hot. An order comes with 4 and I believe it is $6. *There is pork in there, so for my friends who don't eat piggies.....  None for you! :P

Along with the eggrolls, I always get their veggie pho #29 with extra steamed bean sprouts!!!!! Oh and fresh coconut juice if I'm feeling extra hungry! Make sure you try to carve out the flesh of the coconut..... It's a struggle but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Havent been to a Pho House in a while so this was pleasant. Parking was okay, but tight. Location is pretty far off the strip.

Fresh Spring Roll Appetizer was good, I had the Rice combo. Your choice of BBQ Pork of BBQ Chicken, I took the Chicken and Egg Rolls. Great. Love it. It came with a broth soup.Pickled Carrots and some dipping sauce. The other dish was Pho and Viet Ice Coffee. All together $20. What a deal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant on rainbow! Nice atmosphere, friendly servers and good food. We tried the Vietnamese udon and grilled pork with egg rolls over broken rice and some spring rolls. Spring roll were fresh and the sauce was so good! I can't wait to try the rice flour wrap with pork pasted they just put out!"}
{"text":"This review is so troubling for me because of my deep love for Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern Ave. I am a regular there and have never experienced anything less then great, efficient service and consistantly high-quality food. I don't know how they were ever able to open a second location based on the first. Yikes.

My friend and I walked up to the front door only to have 3 employess with aprons and name tags on smoking in front of the front door. Literally blocking the entrance. One opened the door while talking over us with his cig in his mouth. It was a disgusting way to enter a restaurant (ithrough a plume of smoke) especially when you're starving.  Upon walking in,  nobody said anything until we asked if we just seated ourselves. The employee, looking bothered by the interuption, asked how many and looked behind him and pointed to any table. Never even stepping away from his task. So, she and I chose the closest table. We then had to ask for a menu which appeared to annoy them as well. She and I were kind of in disbelief as we wondered if we should even stay? Afterall, we have both frequented the second location and enjoy it so. A woman came to the table and stood there, never asking anything. My friend ordered her Thai tea and I ordered the same with boba. The woman left. When the tea arrived I can tell you fairly (not because of the awful experience) that the tea was watered down and the boba was mealy. So gross. I didn't finish it.  When the waitress came back, she stood there for a minute and said \"do you know what you want?\". Again, another sign that we should have departed. 

We did have a good laugh that the menu prices were crossed out with marker and re-written in with higher prices. 

The food came quickly and of the quality I am used to which was a nice relief from the otherwise disappointing experience. Nobody ever came back, we had to get what we needed ourselves from other tables. I saw another server holding his pack of cigs on the floor in front of tables. He eventually went outside as well. When finished, we went to the register only to see both people behind the register eating Balut with their hands only stopping momentarily to take people's money while still chewing. No handwashing, people. BLECK.  By this point we were especially grossed out at the sanitary standards (smoking servers went right back to work, no handwashing) and wanted to get the heck out.  I am almost so bummed out by this experience that I don't even want to go back to the Eastern location!  What. A. Shame."}
{"text":"3 stars.

This is the location just next to the massive LVAC on 215 and Eastern. Its in that little center on the corner right next to Teriyaki Boy.

The place is pretty small and feels really cramped if there are more than a hndful of people inside. 

As for the food itself, its alright. On my last trip here I had the chicken pho and it was good. Tasty broth and nice juicy chicken. I think there was too much cilantro in mine, but it certainly wasn't a deal breaker.

Service was okay. 

I dont know, nothing was terrible, but at the same time nothing really stood out either. I think the Lemongrass Cafe nearby is probably a better choice for some good Pho.

So 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"It was a cold night at Vegas so my husband and I decided that it was Pho for dinner. Usually we would head to Pho Kim Long but we thought of the busy parking lot and customers at that place. So Pho Saigon 8 it is. Less crowds and no hassles of finding parking so far. 

Service is okay. Simply just bring what you want and your order and check up on you once. My husband and I ordered the same thing #14 pho noodle soup with round steak and tendon. It was good especially on a cold night. The beef broth soup was to my liking with enough flavor and not bland at all. 

We will definitely be back. Price is reasonable and not as noisy. 

Tip: on a cold night, dont sit near the entrance. The ins and outs of customer through the doors sends a wind chill your way. The soup warms you up but later it will dissapate towards the end of your meal.

Oh, i deducted a star. I believe the restaurant could use and updated look. 

HAPPY EATS!!!"}
{"text":"It's Friday....and decided its \"Pho-day\" . Located near our hearty home we wanted to check this place out after shopping. Food was quick to serve,  taste was on point to our liking,  staff was friendly, and meals were reasonably price.

We ordered 2 Large #14 pho noodle soup with round steak and tendons and spring rolls as an appetizer. Mmmm, that was delicious. We will definitely be back. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"By far the best Pho in Vegas!  I've been a loyal customer for 4 years now!  I don't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Can't F up soup.
They got some good soup.
Cheap on the meat though.
Add more meat...not tripe.
Other than that....
Cup O' Nooles BE GONE!!!!"}
{"text":"Service has definitely gotten worse over the years, it's a shame this is one of the only places near Henderson."}
{"text":"So happy that pho Saigon 8 is in my hood,I'm up in here 3 times week.best Vietnam food in Las Vegas....no bullshit!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pho that I've found close to home. Great because it's generous portions at reasonable prices. It's always busy, but the wait is never too long.
I did find that if you are a known regular, or can speak in your server's native language you generally get a lot more attention. That's why they lost a star in my book."}
{"text":"This is the only Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas that I go to even though I live here. In my opinion, their food taste the best compared to all the other places. All of the food is a good portion size except for the soups. Even though you choose large, the bowl won't be as big as you think it'd be. I really like their Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio and Com Bo Luc Lac. My boyfriend always gets their porkchops. My favorite drink to get is their soymilk. It tastes amazing and you can't get it anywhere else. 

When it comes to service, I think that they are fast and nice. I always get greeted and seated right away when I walk in and the food always comes out fast. One of the servers even gave me a free calendar since they give out free calendars around New Year's! I use to come here everyday when I was younger and now that I'm older it's still my most favorite Vietnamese restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"Great customer service !!! I order bun thit nuong and com ga roti so delicious I will be back . I been to alot of viet places but this place is the top of my list now I would recommend this place !!!!"}
{"text":"I just got back from a two week trip to Vietnam and was excited to test out Pho Saigon 8 after reading some good reviews from John Curtis.  

First, I noticed that some have complained about the service.  It's not prompt, or attentive, but trust me, that's authentic!  In Vietnam servers don't get tipped so they have no reason to be attentive, and there you have to ask for your check... So, if it really is Vietnamese staff working there, expect to have to request your check and realize that it's not rude to approach them.

Now for the food!  We ordered vegetarian spring rolls which were tasty, although they could have used some more herby additions.  The dipping sauce was delicious!  We split the Pho Tai (thin strips of beef in the beef pho broth).  The pho was good, not the best I've had, but a solid middle of the road.  It was pretty flavorful, add-ins are appropriate (giant basil, bean sprouts, hot peppers).  But, what impressed me was that they had the rice crepes that have become my favorite Vietnamese meal!

The crepe is made with rice flour (it's a savory crepe, folks), cooked in a pan until a bit crispy, and filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and pork.  It comes with a fish sauce based dripping sauce that augments this dish wonderfully.  With this meal (which appears in the appetizer section, but I use as a main course) comes a giant plate of ruffage.  The proper execution is to take a lettuce leaf, cut off a chunk of the crepe + filling, and use the lettuce leaf as a wrap to make your own little spring roll out of it.  Add in the carrot, some kind of other root vegetable, and mint that they provide.  The rolls are cool and crunchy on the outside, warm, crunchy, and flavorful on the inside.  Don't forget the dipping sauce, it's well worth it.

Most Vietnamese restaurants in town don't extend past pho and some stir-fried rice dishes, and maybe a \"clay pot\" type dish if you're lucky.  This rice \"crepe\" will keep me coming back for more, yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place top 5 pho for me great service small cozy quick and cheap! Lots of families come here so it's great food as I see it!"}
{"text":"Amazing, tasty bowls of goodness! The prices were excellent for the portion size. Great for any time of day, this soup will put you in a full, healthy mood. Superb balance of soup and meats. Service was quick, but communication was a stretch. I still would go there everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"The Pho is good of course but nobody in town can beat their fresh spring rolls..I just hate the fact that this place closes so f!#*ing early.."}
{"text":"A very functional, yet charming venue in Spring Mountain.  Service is robotic but fast.  Food comes out even faster, which is ALWAYS a + for me.

The noodles are prepared tasty and the soup is not too oily as well.  Very good combination of the two.  I don't know about their dish menus too much, but I tried them several times before and they were OK.  Bottom line, the price is good, food is awesome, I recommend it.  It is one of the better Pho locations in Spring Mountain.

PRO: Pho is good, service is fast
CON: Not too much to complain about, service can be a little iffy at times"}
{"text":"Over the years I've come to appreciate Pho Saigon 8. It's not perfect but warrants higher than my previous two star rating. Went there for lunch today and the line was crazy long. Should've seen that coming on a cloudy/rainy day. Pho just seems to go so well on cloudy days, doesn't it?

I had the pho and damn I have to give it to them for their consistency. The flavor hasn't changed in years so you always know what you're getting. Your expectations will always be met. I didn't like the fact that the noodles were still pretty hard and had to sit in the broth for it to soften but it's not the end of the world.

The egg rolls are good and the peanut sauce is actually better than other places I've had it at. The service has gotten much, much better over the years. This is probably my pho spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"Tonight after 9pm  i ordered 2 appetizer togo,because half price,and when i pick-up my order and they said the happy hour only for dining,togo is full price,alright,why doesn't say anything when people order happy hour food,and there's no sign or anything says when you order to go you can't get happy hour price?and the waiter has a bad attitude ."}
{"text":"Ordered two bowl of pho. Typically comes out in 5 minutes or less. Our 5th time here. Never coming again. Waited over 20 min. while 3 other tables who came in after us got theirs before us. I understand if the food should take long to prepare, but didn't make sense that other guest who came in after us got their pho before we did.

We end up going to Hue Thai instead. Fast friendly service there all the time."}
{"text":"This has been my go to Vietnamese spot since I've lived here. Consistent and good Vietnamese food at a fair price. The service could always be better, but that usually goes for most Vietnamese food spots. I will say I do like that they bring out scissors to cut the kid's noodles, this helps."}
{"text":"Since I have been spoiled by Golden Deli in Southern California, it is very difficult for me to give a 5 to any vietnamese restaurant. I did enjoy Pho Saigon 8 more than Pho Kim Long because I believe that the food has much more flavor. I ordered the beef pho with tripe and tendon and it was quite good. It was the first Viet restaurant in Vegas that I ate at and gave a nod of approval to."}
{"text":"Busy night on Thursday but solid service. Pho was mediocre with the broth arriving to our table lukewarm. Not ideal. Also had beef spring rolls, good not great. Overall I've had better Vietnamese in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place to date!!! Their broth just rocks with beef flavor and huge portions. They also don't gyp (no offense to gypsies) you on the bean sprouts, basil, peppers, and lime like most places do. Everyone gets a heaping plate full, not for all to share.

I always wash it down with their home-made soy milk. It's nutty with the right amount of sweetness, and refreshing even in the hot Vegas weather."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good vietnamese food i must say.  Been coming here alot actually this past year and some occasions we'll visit twice in our trip.

Pho broth is VERY tasty, meats are fresh.  Mi soup broth is great as well, they give u so many wontons.  2 sizes but both bowls are massive.  Favorite dish there is Com Tam Bi Cha Suong Nuong.  The pork chop is tender/great flavor compared to other spots and their egg cha is superb.  I normally am unimpressed with egg cha at other places even tho i love it, so its awesome that I'm able to enjoy it again.  And their Bi is not overly dry which is great.  

The restaurant is big and their turn around time for tables are quick even though they get busy alot.

Service is a hit or miss.  I mean its a vietnamese restaurant, ur not gonna be catered in royalty.  Just expect your first requests for items to not come and be patient to flag them or someone else down for it again."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner. Their ph is pretty good and their servings are pretty large as well. I always order the egg rolls as well whenever I come here because they are very delicious, and never overly fried. Most of the time I've gone here, customer service has always been average and tonight was just horrible. The staff was just not attentive and were were given attitude the whole time. I definitely won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pho here are always consistent in flavored and deliciousNess!!! Great price and portion. Quick service.  In and out lol... Ordered #18 if your down with tender beef flank and tendons, yum."}
{"text":"The fact that the server wasn't friendly enough ticked me of. I rather eat at a Thai Restaurant anytime. I didn't try anything at all. My friend said it was good. He tried the soup or something."}
{"text":"Typically my family goes to the Pho Saigon on Eastern but since this was central we decided to come here and big mistake it's worth the drive to eat at the other location. There is this one lady I believe her name is Thuy (older with a mean face) she wouldn't let the other wait staff take our order or even help service our party of 8. She was rude and obviously doesn't care about customer service! They messed up our order 2 times and she tried to blame that we said it wrong, when clearly she could easily just fix it. I will never come here again!"}
{"text":"First timers. Felt optimistic because it was packed, must be a good place right? We ordered egg rolls and halfway through saw a giant bug crawling around the lettuce. Bug in the food. Need I say more? If one is crawling around our food, imagine the kitchen. Couldn't get the feeling that I ate bug filled egg rolls out of my mind, total bummer."}
{"text":"I get the 66 or 71 (same as the 66 but comes with an egg roll) flavorful charcoal grilled pork with a nice array of vegitables and peanuts over vermicelli noodles. Today I am getting the 71 for lunch. Oh, and their Pho is delicious I like it with the softened tendons. What can I say, I like visceral meats."}
{"text":"Let it be said that there is absolutely nothing horrible about this place.  Everything is just mediocre.  

First, the decor was the best thing about it.  It was new, well-painted, pretty paintings and new chairs and tables with granite on top.  There were nice fake plants on the ceilings and walls, and the bathroom was clean, and nice.  The problem is that the tables had this bar under them where my friend kept hitting his knees against.  The tables were set so close together that I could probably have reached over to the other table and stolen a spring roll off of it.

Speaking of the spring rolls, they were just not good.  The flour sheets on the spring rolls were chewy, and they did not have that nice crunchy stuff in the center that tastes really good, like the ones at Lemongrass.  The dipping sauce was good, but not exceptional.

The pho was the biggest let-down today.  Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain had rich, full broth, that seemed just a little too fatty, and was very good.  This one was rather thin, and its flavor was easily masked by any of the things that you could put in it.  For example, more basil meant that the pho tasted like basil and not pho.  Add bean sprouts, and the pho tasted like water and not much else.  The meat was good, though, and they put a liberal amount of green onion, which I always like.

I also tried the lemon soda.  This was a very good soda, although it was much too sweet.  I think it could have benefited from having more lemon flavor and less sugar in it.  

They have no sandwiches.  

In addition, everything there is smaller, and/or more expensive than Lemongrass, right across the street.  For example, the large pho was the same price for both, but the bowl is smaller was easily finished by myself and my friend.  We've almost never finished a large pho at Lemongrass.  The Vietnamese seafood crepe was both smaller *and* more expensive, by as much as $0.50-$1.00, and while good, made me a little skittish about ordering it again.  The Spring Rolls were the same price, but came with only two instead of three like at Lemongrass.  

Much as I want to see more pho places around, I simply cannot recommend this place with Lemongrass Cafe so close to it.  Maybe if it was in the middle of rural Nevada with no other competition, it would have impressed me more.  I'm sorry, Pho Saigon 8 :/"}
{"text":"fast service great pho !!!! i love their wonton soup and combo fried rice !!! i know they improved in cleanliness from dirty dining over 2 years ago!!!! keep at it PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Vietnamese cuisine. I have been to a few spots in town & I must say the chicken pho was phenomenal! Lots of meat, veggies & awesome noodles. The broth was NOT salty, it was perfection. 

My mom tried the veggie pho with tofu, broccoli, bok choy, carrots & onions. She was in heaven. 

We also ordered tofu spring rolls.. Did not disappoint. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decent food, fast service and good prices.
Service is so-so! We went around 8:15 and they were closing at 9pm.
One of the servers came by the table and pick up the sauce bottle even before e ordered something. Later on, after we were already eating, one of the servers stop putting the chairs up and sweeping under the table right next to us, event if it was 8:50 only. Would eat there, if I have huge crave and I want something quick, but I would check other places as well"}
{"text":"Dry pho noodles are super good.if you haven't tried it's a great variation to the classic. Even the small size is filling. Very pleasant service here. Thoroughly recommended."}
{"text":"Decent pho.  Not the best nor the worst but it hits the spot.  Their springs rolls were mediocre so I would recommend skipping that since it's not worth the cost.

I thought it was annoying how they listed all these different combos for pho.  I usually like to order everything in my beef pho (flank, steak, tripe, tendon, etc) so it would have been nice to have one that is labeled the works or something.  Oh and they charge extra if you want meatball so you have been warned.

Btw, you pay at the counter. ;)"}
{"text":"I give asian places a pass on service b/c they aren't known for providing good service, but with over 170+ reviews, my 1 star review won't really affect the Yelp Rankings.  Anyhow...

There is an asian troll lady with short hair and glasses, probably in her 30's.  She probably moonlights at one of the 50 Massage parlors on Spring Mtn afterhours.   She is the biggest d-bag.  I will call her VFDB, Vietnamese Female D-Bag for short.   Here is the play-by-play

after we're done we walk up to the register to pay and my friend asks if we can pay separately with cash to which VFDB replies - just pay one - it's too much work for her to split it up.

{"text":"I spent my childhood in Vietnam and my young adulthood in Orange County where the best Vietnamese food is outside of Vietnam.  Having said that, this restaurant is a good substitute of Orange County Vietnamese food.  

Most non-Vietnamese will come here for pho, and their beef pho is good.  But their chicken pho is better.  You can order it with white meat or dark meat or a combination of both.  I prefer the combination.  You can also get Mien Ga, which is a noodle soup with the chicken pho broth and bean thread noodle, very healthy and yummy (bean thread noodle is a good source of fiber).  

Another good dish here is the Hu Tieu My Tho, which is a noodle soup with pork broth, clear & chewy rice noodle, topped with shrimp, calamari, ground pork, and quail eggs.  It is a very authentic dish from south Vietnam and Pho Saigon 8 has a very good version.  

As with most Vietnamese restaurants, the service can be slow and sporadic but the decor is nicer than many other Vietnamese restaurants in town.  I really recommend this place if you are in the Southeast side of Vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible service! They took my order incorrectly, we returned to pick up the correct order, no apology, no discount for us having to return back to their store a second time and they didn't even refund the order that we paid for that was incorrect in the first place! They have a bad attitude and horrible service!! Don't go here! There's another pho place right down the street in the same parking lot of inn and out and their service is sooooo much better!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't get any headache after having their #72.  Usually I'll get a headache after consuming MSG.  The meat was soft and tender.  Vegetables are fresh.  Staffs are friendly.  I can't say anything bad about this place."}
{"text":"Unless I am so far from this location AKA in Centennial Hills I'll travel to go to Pho Saigon 8. Nothing beats this place. I wish the prices hadn't raise almost a dollar, but that's inflation for you. Oh well, I'll still come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! And prompt service!!  Could use more English speaking waiters/waitresses due to the language barrier but the fantastic food makes up for it!! Eat here!"}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Seriously the worst. Bad attitudes, grim faces. The food is good if you can get someone to serve you. No welcome. No greeting. No thank you. They make you feel like a burden. Deserve zero stars but the food is good enough if you're desperate and patient"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food! As authentic as it can get! This place has been around for a while and seems to get better in time! I had the Bun Bo Hue! Delicious broth and plenty of meat! Dave had the special fried rice! Generous portion! Also ordered their Pho specials to go for mom and her sister! You know this place is good when mom says it is!"}
{"text":"Everything's relative.

I've read some disappointing reviews on Pho Saigon 8 from some Californians here on Yelp.  You see, they come from environs where Asians are not a small minority, but a small majority.  Just by virtue of sheer statistics, I'd expect that the pho experiences they've had are \"better.\"

That said, I love pho.  I've been eating it for years.  I've lived in NoCal and SoCal, and in my opinion, Pho Saigon 8's a good joint.  As the best in Vegas, it may not better the best in Cali, but I still only go here whenever I crave pho since I live here in Vegas - and I have frequent cravings.  I've eaten pho from about half a dozen different spots in Vegas, and this is the best one out of all of them from a value and pho quality standpoint.  Pricing is pretty reasonable - not a killer deal, but a very good one relative to the other pho restaurants in the area.  There's a wide variety of different pho combinations (deriving from variety in the combinations of beef offered, from flank to tendon to beef balls to tripe).  One observer noted that the broth is quite salty and not oily - she is dead on.  I have a weakness for saltiness, so I don't mind it, but you'll be reaching for water after you finish your pho, especially if you delve into the broth.  Another small plus is that they are quite generous with the basil and sprouts add ons relative to other Vietnamese restaurants I've had pho at.

Also, since the restaurant is relatively new, the dining area seems relatively clean, if spartan.  Pho Saigon 8 always seems busy whenever I go, which is good from a food turnover standpoint.  The bathrooms aren't particularly nice...a bit skeevy...but could be much worse - by Asian restaurant standards, I'd say it's slightly above average.  The servers are generally workmanlike; not particularly friendly, but not rude either.  You may have to work to get their attention if you need something though, and they never check up on you after serving you your food like non-Asian restaurants.  The non-pho dishes I've eaten and seen eaten by friends have always been of comparable quality to the pho too.  The pho comes out quickly, and the restaurant can accommodate everyone from single diners to large groups.  

I'd like to give this a 4.5 out of 5, but since you have to award a 4 or 5, I'm giving it a 5 because I eat here regularly as a fan of pho, it has very good value, and I believe it to be the best Vietnamese food in the area.  As a bonus, they don't have any annoying credit card minimums which seem to sneak up on you in some of the local Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was rather good. The service was decent. Clean. And they didn't kick us out (even though the lunch rush was starting to come in) for sitting and chatting even though the last child finished eating half an hour earlier. HaHa!"}
{"text":"The Pho is really good here.  I love the little cart on the table with all the equipment you need including sriracha and what I think is eel sauce?  They are really quick, you order and they bring it out within minutes.  The size large is super large though!  The decor is odd, but not bad for a Mom and Pop Shop atmosphere.  It is pretty cheap too, I think I spent $11.00 on mine for a large bowl and water to drink.  I really loved the fresh basil leaves, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Came late night for dinner and even though we were the last ones there the food was still great. We ordered the Saigon noodle soup (#51 I believe) and it had an amazing flavor. We also tried #53 the fried noodle with meat, seafood, and veggie and it was delicious. We had a good overall experience and the waitress was nice about suggesting certain popular dishes and her favorites."}
{"text":"Yummy. Solid bowl of pho. Spring rolls and summer were both great. My friend got the mango green tea and it was really yummy. Sweet. The red chili sauce was good with the summer/spring rolls. Good food, decently priced."}
{"text":"I have traveled to many different establishments in search of some pho that matches the taste and quality of my mother in laws. Pho Saigon 8 on eastern and 215 is the closest yet. I routinely get the number 11. It comes with a plate of different garnishes such as bean sprouts, mint leaves, and sliced jalapeño peppers.  I add plumb sauce and saracha for an extra added kick that broadens the journey through taste town.  It tastes like life. It's a spiritual journey for me every time I dive into a bowl of this magic bone broth, thin sliced raw meat, and noodles. It's always clean and I've never had to wait to be seated.  The place stays full with a steady stream of regulars and workout veterans from across the parking lot. The café ser da is another amazing coffee treat that will spark off your day proper.  I've had a few other items off the menu, all of which were rich with flavor and filling. The meals are reasonably-priced and the service has always been superior. If you are a fan of delicious food from Veit Nam, a stop by here won't dissapoint. Lastly, don't fear the fish sauce."}
{"text":"This is the only place my wife will get pho. We have tried other places but she said they don't compare to a bowl you'll get here. I usually stick to a rice dish and a meat and recently had the pork plate with white rice and egg roll. I don't remember the number but it was a great portion for the price.

The service is hit and miss as you might not get a waiter back at the table after you've ordered.  Food comes out pretty fast especially if you have ordered the pho."}
{"text":"Good place to go for pho if you're craving noodles and not in Chinatown. My friends and I went here on a Saturday night, and were pleased that it wasn't too busy. After perusing the menu, my friend and I decided to split a large #11 (Pho Tai- Noodle soup with rare round eye steak, $7.50) while my other friend ordered the #67 (Bun Ga Nuong- Grilled chicken over vermicelli and vegetables, $7.45). I asked for extra bean sprouts to which the waiter didn't seem to have a problem with. Our food came out quickly, which was a plus. 

Pho Tai- Better here than other pho places in the neighborhood. The noodles were the perfect texture- not overcooked, but still soft with a chewy bite. The soup was a little more oily (I could see oil puddles floating on the top) than what I'm used to, but still good and hot nonetheless. And the accompanying plate of veggies & herbs (bean sprouts, basil & lemon (not technically a vegetable or herb...) was fresh. The portion size was good- plenty of noodles & meat- with the addition of bean sprouts, I was definitely full. 

Bun Ga Nuong- I only tried the grilled chicken, which I thought was flavorful and very teriyaki-y, but some of the pieces that I ate had too much fat on them; however, I liked the sweetness and charred flavor of the chicken. 

I didn't really feel like the service was bad. I mean it did take a while for them to bring the check, but my friends and I didn't really have a problem with that because we were too busy talking. I thought the servers were nice. I also like how this place is cleaner than other pho restaurants I've been to. So I think I'll come back when I'm craving pho not only because the food is good, but because it's located right next to my favorite frozen yogurt shop."}
{"text":"It was 8:30 p.m. on a cool Thursday evening. My daughter and I had just been in the neighborhood and thought about eating Pho. We had seen this restaurant many times as we drove by but never stopped in. I wish we never had. We walked in and there was no one in the establishment. One of the employees were cleaning the floors and chairs were pulled out from the tables. We asked if they were open and the owner waved us in and we sat. (They close at 10:00p.m.)The two flat screen tvs were off and it was very quiet....really quiet. We ordered a large pho tai and salt and pepper shrimp to share. The soup broth was not the best and you could see alot of oil floating on top and not to mention hardly any noodles. We were thirsty from the saltiness and needed a refill on water but all the employees and the owner were sitting down eating dinner. I had to get up and ask for service. Three other tables came in and were seated at 8:45pm. Once their food was delivered the employees once again sat at \"their\" table and continued eating. I had to stand up once again to ask for the check. I'm sorry I had not gone to Lemongrass Cafe to eat in the first place. We will never go back to this establishment. One more thing. As one of the employees brought our dish of the shrimp, he asked if we wanted rice (which comes with this order). We said yes and as he walked bakc to the kitchen, sneezed a very large, loud, yucky sneeze, we almost didn't want the rice!!!!! Gross!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I've been here quite a few times over the past year or so. Quality has gone down and service always bad. I've yet to have my water refilled here, ever. You have to flag someone down if you want a to go box, extras, a napkin, anything. .. Sometimes I've been ignored. I went recently and the soup was cold, broth not as great as it's been and my meat looked old and had spots??? On it.... There was also something in identifiable in the soup. I always order the same kind so not sure what was up. I'm very disappointed and may just find a better place from now on."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bun Bo Hue with rice noodles over the phone for pick up and I think this dish is better to eat in the restaurant, the broth was still super hot when my dad dropped it off. The broth wasn't spicy to my liking even with the chili on the side but overall it was still good I just added more chilli oil that I have at home.  I would order the soup bete again the broth is really good not bland like Pho 88.  Try this dish with rice noodles it's so much better than regular noodles you don't feel guilty."}
{"text":"Best pho I have found. They also offer tripe which is very difficult to find in Vegas. I recommend only going to this location- the other location I have walked out of three times before ordering because the service makes me want to hurt people. This location has quick service and the bomb pho."}
{"text":"Pho has always been my favorite noodle soup. This place was very affordable, even the imported beers were cheap.  A lot of options and great service!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  I can't say if it's the best pho in Vegas - as I've only been to a couple other places around town for pho - but it is delicious.

As others have stated, the broth is a bit on the salty side.  I don't mind salty, but it tends to overshadow some of the sweet component of the broth that makes pho unique and not just some generic noodle dish.

I ordered #18, dac biet - which includes rare beef, tripe, and tendon.  There was a really large chunk of tendon at the bottom of the bowl and that was my favorite part.  I also ordered a banh mi french baguette for one dollar which helped sop up some of the broth.

The place is clean, easy parking, and super fast service (pho arrived less than 2 minutes from order).  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is just as good as the original one on Spring Mountain.  The good news for me is that it's right next to my office so I intend to sample everything off of their extensive menu instead of just the pho which I normally get.

Just in the last few weeks since it's opened I've tried some new stuff like the #2 veggie spring rolls which had some good tofu inside, #7 Banh Xeo which I really liked (its like putting a savory, greasy shrimp pancake inside a lettuce wrap and then adding fresh mint and dipping into sauce) and the #73 Bun Bo Hue which was a little underwhelming.  

The manager, Eric, is really nice and helpful.  I will be going back again and again until I've tried it all!"}
{"text":"The food is good and they are very quick and friendly

Only drawback, I don't know how many English speaking customers they get  here, but there it's usually not a member of the waitstaff who speaks any form of English. You usually have to point at the menu and hope for the best.."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for pho.  I have been everywhere.  This place is the best.  The broth is consistently very good and the meats are piled high.  The restaurant is large and spacious.  Staff is friendly.  I always leave here full and highly satisfied.  if you want pho, this is where you need to be!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as good as the spring mountain location, but it's a great lunch spot for me n my coworkers. The service is not too bad and it's fairly clean. The pho broth is tasty and better than anything else in the SE. Lemongrass n pho little Saigon across the street aren't as good. I think this place is more of a 3.5 stars, but I give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I usually get a large #21 and an order of fried egg rolls.  Bill usually comes out to around $18.  A little steep, but totally worth it.  

The egg rolls are always hot and crispy served with lettuce, cilantro, carrots, and radishes.  I love making lettuce wraps with my egg roll or with some noodles and meat in my bowl of pho.  I guess it is the korean in me that makes me do this.

The #21 has pretty much all of the meats including tendon.  Only thing missing are the beefballs and tripe.  The broth tastes the same as their location on Spring Mountain.  I feel like the bowl is a little smaller than most other places that serve a larage, but i always leave super full.  So it could just be an optical illusion.  

Service is ok.  I wouldn't say it is great, but it isn't bad either.  This location is new so I figure they are still getting the kinks worked out.  I highly recommend this place for anyone craving pho.  You will leave full and happy."}
{"text":"One of my fave pho places in Las Vegas. The food comes out fast and the dishes are tasty. It's hard to steer away from my usual pho tai, but when I do I go for the bun bowls. I'm always stuffed to the gills when I leave and usually go home for a nap. MSG? Yeah... maybe but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Went to eat yesterday with my mom and sister. My sister order some pho and found a roach in her soup. Asked to speck to the owner or manager whoever he was. Anyway told him about it and he didn't even care about the situation and still charged us for the soup. Told him we're gonna report u guys to the health department. You know what he said \"Do whatever you want. I don't care.\" Yup we did already. End of story."}
{"text":"Broth is wayyyy too oily.  What Viet restaurant doesn't have Tai Sac on the menu?  Rice dishes aren't great either."}
{"text":"Nous avons bien aimé notre diner. Petit restaurant familial ou nous avons pu apprécier un 78 et 56. Bons plats copieux pour 30$ pour 2 personnes. Arriver vers 18h30, la salle était tranquille.  Vers 19h30 il y a plus de monde. Nous reviendrons !"}
{"text":"I was told that this place had good food, so my friend and I came here in observance of my birthday. When we were seated, we told the waiter that we needed time to look at the menu. We hadn't seen each other in a while, so we were chatting while looking at the menu. Within less than 3 minutes, we were abruptly asked by the same waiter and a waitress whether we were ready. Talk about pushy. I picked something quickly on the menu so they would stop pestering us, and my friend found something shortly afterward. I honestly wanted to leave, but my friend didn't want to fight traffic to find another place, so we stayed and tried to make the best of it.

When we received our food, it was fine, though we have had much better Vietnamese food elsewhere in town. I put some chili sauce on my noodle bowl and left it next to my food in case I wanted more. An older male waiter came by and snatched up the chili sauce without even asking whether I was done with it. I'm not joking. When I went to the restroom, I saw that they had several large containers of chili sauce on a shelf in the hallway, so it's not as though they were short on sauce for other customers. 

Overall, it was a bad experience, and the staff showed themselves to be rude and impersonal towards their customers, which is nonsensical since customers are the ones who provide their livelihood. Maybe they should remember that. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I come here when I want some pho. Think its somewhat better than other pho places. The pho taste a little less oily."}
{"text":"This place has the right grilled pork dry vermicelli bowl that I like. I would suggest trying that dish here. Lemongrass has half the amount of the same dish, and this place makes it the way I like it. I'd recommended it to my friend, and he likes it too. Pho is okay here, I would prefer Lemongrass for if I wanted pho."}
{"text":"This pho joint used to be pretty good, but now it's not even a thought when I'm craving any type of Viet dish. Went here with my boyfriend for a lunch and I ordered a Seafood hue tieu and everything in it tasted so gross I just ate the noodles! The squid, the shrimp, eck all of it tasted frozen and old. My boyfriend said their nouc mam was really weak and I just felt like the service just sucked too. I know how these places are, but can anyone just smile? Way better pho joints in town, trust me."}
{"text":"Coffee is okay food is great staff is blahhh . Maybe it's because they don't speak English."}
{"text":"They have plenty of food choices and everything was very good. The food also came out fast and I like that.
However, I wasn't a big fan of the customer service.. they don't greet you when you walk in or really talk to you at all. They just ask if we're ready to order and write down everything we order quietly and leave. 
They also don't check on us and ask if everything was okay. I noticed 4 of the waiters/waitresses would sit in the back booth and talk until one of us had to wave and ask them to come over. 
I don't think their customer service was all that great and I suggest to work on that."}
{"text":"This restaurant had great food and a clean, comfy environment. There were 30+ types of pho. I loved the vegetarian Vietnamese spring rolls with peanut sauce. I appreciated the sturdy armless chairs and sturdy tables as well. The servers were friendly and helpful. A+++"}
{"text":"I haven't had some yummy Viet food in a while so I was super stoked when my aunt and uncle took me here!
My craving for bun w/ pork & spring rolls were satified (I also got shrimp & beef in there too! LoL) PLUS the 3 color drink was delicious!
My aunt says this is the best Viet spot in town...I won't try another one! ;)
YuM!"}
{"text":"This place is pho-tanstic! 

Two of us arrived on a quiet afternoon and filled our table with fresh spring rolls, hot coffee with condensed milk, and two huge bowls of pho. The spring rolls had an abundance of ingredients tightly wrapped within. You can see through the sheer wrap and find large pieces of shrimp. Dip it into the peanut sauce and savor each bite. The hot coffee was particularly refreshing since we were both sleep deprived. My bowl of pho had rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, and soft tendon. The broth was the star. The flavor was so blatant that you can tell they spent hours putting this concoction together. The broth had a tight grasp on each strand of pho making you yearn for more after each bite. The meat was tender as well but the soft tendon really did the works for me. It was so delicate and spongy that it absorbed most of the broth. Each bite came with a burst. 

This is another surprising find that I will look forward to repeating when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Im a fan of the one on spring mnt but I thought I try this one. I must say the service was good and pleasant. The noodles were a bit over cooked and mushy but the pho was still good."}
{"text":"This is now the best Pho restaurant in town. Excellent customer service and the pho are amazingly, addictive. Better than Pho Kim long! 

If the drinks were free refills, then it would be 5 stars hands down! 

Overall, excellent place! Booyah!"}
{"text":"Service is fast.  Bring the family here twice a month.  Large portions of the Pho with great broth and they do not skimp on the side ingredients.  Great price for the food.  The #11 is fantastic, meat is lean and not fatty."}
{"text":"I rarely submit negative reviews but had a bad experience at this restaurant. I work walking distance away and have always eaten here for lunch however today the waiter brought out an incorrect item which I was fine with. I asked for clean brisket with no fat and the person brought out brisket with a ton of fat. The lady replaced it and apologized which I was fine with. When I went to pay, the cashier took my $100 bill and used the counterfeit money marker which is totally fine but even after the marker showed it was a real $100 bill, he asked for a second opinion. The next person came and used the pen again and then asked for a third opinion. The lady held my bill under the light and clearly saw it was real but continued to inspect the bill. She also put the bill next to a counterfeit one to feel the paper and see if its real. At this point I was very annoyed and took out a $1000 of $100s to show that they are all real. I had to pull out my badge to show them I am a neighbor of the business and have always eaten there. The food is great but the experience was terrible. I refer everyone at my work to eat there but that will not be happening going forward."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.. order soup based upon picture.. waiter brought out a different soup. When I request to switch he said no that's what you ordered. I never like to send food back but I was craving a particular soup so it was very annoying. I come to this restaurant at least once a week and the lady server is always nice. She was not here today so my order got messed up. :-(

Thank you for relying but I didn't change my mind. It was not what I ordered. After he refused to take it back I didn't want to make a scene & uncomfortable for my husband. I've been in community for many years & many of our friends and family go there but we will take our business somewhere else since both you & your staff are missing the svc point. Thank you."}
{"text":"bun bo hue yummy,
but i dont understand about the purple basil.
but i  tried ,the first i ate purple basil.
the taste difficult for me, but my hubby like it.
this place  my  friend  recommend for me.
i believe her, because she live at henderson ,las vegas."}
{"text":"Until now, I really did not know the difference between good and merely average pho.  I have eaten at different places in LA and Orange County, but I suppose I was eating at places that were not Vietnamese neighborhoods, which presumably would have the best pho.

In any event, the key to good pho seems to be the broth (blinding flash of the obvious).  And whatever they do to their broth, it has a much richer flavor, much similar in the sense that the right broth makes miso soup or ramen excellent.

Even at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, this place is crowded, though we got a seat right away.  It has big tables for parties of 10 and it was being used as such, rather than a bunch of small parties.

The service was incredibly good for a bustling Asian restaurant and tolerant of our non-pho expertise.  As a note, instead of getting a bill at your table, when you pay up, just note your table number to the register.  Very efficient.

After being charged $12.99 for essentially a grand slam Denny's breakfast and $3.99 for a glass of juice at the casino, I was happy to pay $35 for 2 large bowls of pho, 1 small bowl of pho, 2 order of spring rolls and 2 hot teas."}
{"text":"Pretty great pho place!

My friends and I have tried the other Pho Saigon in the area and we all agreed that the food was better at this location, but the service was better at the other location. Service wasn't too attentive, we waited a while before we waved someone down to get them to take our order. Service didn't stop by to check up on my group, but everything was alright.

This is the only pho place I've been to that serves pho with red onions instead of white onions. Was very satisfied with the amount of rare steak in my pho-- perfect meat to noodle ratio. The broth was also good, not watered down like the usual pho places I go to in California.

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It is located where The American Grill used to be.

I have prepared more Vietnamese food at home than I have dined out.
That being said , I found it to be tasty.

I had the Hue Style Hot & Spicy Soup, although not spicy enough.  
A little Rooster Sauce took care of that though...

We went in the first few days of them being open.  
The service was ok.  Hopefully, it will get better.

I think we'll try Lemongrass Cafe next time..."}
{"text":"I've had better Vietnamese food, but this place is not bad (Vegas standards). I got the Rice with Grilled Chicken and Egg rolls, and it was only decent. The chicken looked old and was super hard, while the egg rolls were okay...wish they were a bit more crunchy. Portion was big though, and I was pretty stuffed by the end. 
Probably won't come back, but it was still a good experience nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after checking out other places decided to come here because of the many reviews it has. The restaurant is spacious a lot of tables, the servers are friendly and helpful and very fast! We sat down and immediately had water served. Our order came out in minutes and it was very fresh. I absolutely love Pho and can say it was very very good! I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple days ago and I loved this place. I ordered the well done beef with beef meatballs and it was delicious! You can tell this is your better than your average pho restaurant because the locals seem to love it and it was packed when I went in the early evening. Don't know why it has a 3 star rating...should either be 4 or 5 stars.

Also, you know it's a good pho restaurant because it has pho in its name and a random number."}
{"text":"Post-Vegas escapade meal? Hangover food? Whatever state you're in,  you can't do wrong with a place selling Vietnamese food that is filled w Vietnamese customers."}
{"text":"Went there on a 6/18/16 Saturday, around 4 during EDC week and wanted some comfort food so searched for the closes place I could get pho from my resort... 

Service: no complains at all... Unfortunately I didn't get his name, only saw he was wearing a white Nike hat. I changed my order after I've ordered already cause I couldn't make up my mind, he did not give me any ugly looks, my ice water was never empty, always has a smile on his face and that's major plus to the restaurant... I was a server as well so I pay extra attention to servers performance and he did great.

Now food, here's the down side... I ordered a large Bun Bo Hue and instead of regular noodles I requested for pho noodles (personal liking, chewier). It could've definitely use a lil more flavor for sure, I ordered pho so it would be more chewy... But mines came out really soft, kinda disappointment... It was filling... But I did order a large. 

Service was great
Food wise wasn't bad, but definitely had better
That's what took the star away for me
Will go back for sure, to see if it'll be better to get that five star"}
{"text":"Always good pho !
Love their spring rolls.
Good Char meats - beef, pork, chicken and pork chops.
Fast friendly service.
Would highly recommend ."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday for lunch. The food is pretty decent but the service is where they're lacking most. Someone was seated a few minutes after us on a connected table and they took her order first and instead of taking ours immediately after, they left and came back."}
{"text":"After I ordered about $50 worth of food to go... I asked for a little bit of soup broth for my rice meal(which usually comes in free when you dine in)... she said it's $2 extra for it. Fine then, no more Saigon for us... there's plenty of Pho places now out here on the SW side. Thank you for being stingy...should be minus star!"}
{"text":"UPDATED:

So I totally understand about controlling your costs. I am all for it. So tell me why INSTEAD OF TELLING ME I HAD TO PAY, she just tells me no, I just can't have it. I explained to her I didn't expect to get the PHO veggies for free. 

Then, when I asked for extra veggies of WHAT COMES  WITH IT, I am charged another $2?!? 

Come on. The location on JONES and Spring Mountain HAS NEVER EVER EVER charged for extra veggies. 

ON TOP of the AWFUL customer service I experienced from the elderly woman at the register. She's rude and interrupts you when you are asking questions. 

If I could give negative starts for the experience I had tonight, I would. -- $4 for veggies. Absolutely unbelievable. More than HALF the cost of my actual food I ordered. There is something WRONG with that picture, especially when I get home and see THE VEGGIES ARE SKIMPED ON ANYWAY!!! (Hahah!) Geeeez man.

I ordered egg rolls and asked for extra veggies - 1 bag of what usually comes with it and another of what comes with the soup. Instead of offering to have me pay a little extra, the woman just straight up tells me \"no\" / \"no what?\" / \"you cant have that. We can't do that.\" 

Now, I didn't say this to her, but I'm just thinking TJ myself, what on earth do you mean you \"CANT\" do that? I am a paying (AND RETURNING) customer for crying out loud. 

It's the LITTLEST things that can either bring your consumers BACK or ensure they bad mouth you to whoever they know that will listen; ultimately resulting in loss of business for your establishment. 

I mean, really? A bag of veggies? How petty can you people seriously be?"}
{"text":"Located around the corner from Yogurtland with kind of a limited amount of parking is this wonderful place. Honestly I only get the bun bo hue here and it's a spicy beef noodle soup. It's perfect for a rainy cold day. It's not too spicy and they do offer chili oil to make it spicier if you'd like. My husband always gets just the reg pho tai which is just thinly sliced beef in a clear bone broth.  The give ample veggies (like bean sprouts, mint, basil and jalapeños) to add to your soup. So here's the big secret about Vietnamese soup....best hangover cure ever!!!! The noodles to absorb all the alcohol, the meat to fill your belly, and the natural oils from the broth to satisfy that need for greasy food with a healthier option!"}
{"text":"Anywhere you have a decently sized Vietnamese community.. you can count on Pho restaurants being around... and typically there is going to be much more than one of them.. So how does one decide which one to go to??? Family, close friends, and the help of Yelp reviews are what I usually go off of.

So this little gem way off the strip.. and past I dunno how many other pho restuarants along the way.. was suggested to me by my family about a year ago and still remains to be one of my favorite pho places to go to while in Vegas.

What typically differentiates pho restuarants from each other is the combination quality and freshness of the ingredients, how everything is cooked.. but most of all, the broth.

There's no doubt that most people tend to add hoisin sauce, sriracha, lime, and various other condiments to cater to one's taste... but you certainly need a solid foundation to begin with... and the broth here is most definitely done very well."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure about the soup based dishes, but the broken rice dishes are trash. Me and my brother ate the com suon and the rice was really soggy and terrible and the meat was incredibly dry and somewhat burnt. It seems like they quickly reheated the meat and gave it to us, I'm dissapointed. Whatever happens, don't eat the rice, it's cheap and nasty rice. And the dish was around $11 not worth my money."}
{"text":"AWSOME! First time I came here and it was very good! Good service! Clean and nice looking place, and the best part the soup taste exactly like it suppose to- incredible!
Will be back soon :) (ordered vegetarian broth with tofu)"}
{"text":"I got take out so this is just my observation from the waiting area. Plenty of local customers so this place is popular. It's located off the 215 at Eastern so you don't have to drive 30 minutes to the Chinatown area of Vegas for Pho. But they have yummy Bun Bo Hue, Banh Xeo, goi cuon rolls and decent. Vegetarian selections too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. If I could eat here every day I definitely would. I have to say, this is my favorite restaurant ever. I am a HUGE fan of #56 is a plate of Korean barbecue pork, rice, egg rolls, salad and broth. I always come with the thought of trying something new but I am hooked with this dish, I will never be able to say no to it. The prices of the food great."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Yummy fresh coconut juice, Thai iced tea with boba, and Vietnamese coffee. My parents ordered pho and com tam. My boyfriend and I ordered bun thit and hu tieu. I must say it's great food for being in Vegas! Great day after recovery food!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese BBQ  Shrimp Vermicelli or Bun Tom topped with grilled pork (thit),  is my favorite Vietnamese dish!   I love Vietnamese bun because it's not only tasty, but very healthy as it's not greasy and comes with all sorts of vegetables and herbs. Every bite is refreshing and appetizing; a noodle dish that is both filling and satisfying. Most people who have tried Vietnamese food are familiar with Pho, unfortunately for me it's fun to say but not to eat, I've just never had a taste for it.  So, if you're like me and have family and friends who dig Pho give this dish a try.  You're welcome!  And don't forget the Thai tea with boba."}
{"text":"I normally don't give out many 1 star ratings, but sadly my recent visit to Pho Saigon 8 was horrible. The first time I tried this place years ago, it was really good and then I came back again around 2012. I noticed even that visit in 2012 wasn't as great as my first visit. Now, 2014, I found out the old owner had left which explained the decline in EVERYTHING for this restaurant. Customer service AND food were absolutely horrible. Gordon Ramsay needs to host this place in Kitchen Nightmares!

The server had a horrible attitude and wouldn't let me make modifications. Hello, you're a vietnamese restaurant, not a high end michelin star place so slow your role! In the end she still got my order wrong. I ordered the chicken vermicelli w/ cha (steamed egg quiche) w/out vermicelli. My order came out w/ vermicelli and NO cha. I figured maybe she forgot and it wouldn't be in the bill so I didn't bring it to her attention, but after we got the bill we noticed she did charge us for it!

Chicken Vermicelli - Noodles were over cooked, chicken was disgusting. I've never had chicken as dry as the NV desert in the summer. There was no flavor to the marinade either and too much black grill marks. TBH, they used chicken thigh and it shouldn't be this dry/bad. This is probably the first time I couldn't finish my plate because the food was so bad. Normally I hate wasting food so I would suck it up and try to finish it, but this was just beyond edible.

Chicken broken rice plate - Again, same crappy chicken that I had in the vermicelli. Rice was super old and dry. Everything seemed microwaved

Pho tai bo vien - The beef was overcooked as well as the noodles. The bo vien was ok

Bun Cha Hanoi - OVERCOOKED PORK, again marinade was off. At least the veggies seemed clean & fresh

Mi cha siu kho - the cha siu (bbq pork) was like rubber/microwaved. Again, my friend couldn't finish this plate either

Cha gio (egg rolls) - not the best I've had, outershell wasn't crispy enough. Was too oily

Bo luc lac - Normally anything w/ oyster sauce & garlic seasoning/marinade should taste good, but this dish like all the others weren't palatable. Plus the portion was small for the price

So basically we paid and left hungry still. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Great Pho, loved there fast friendly service. 
Definitely recommend to all Vietnamese food lovers!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Pho for the longest time but never did. I finally got up the nerve and can't believe I waited this long. Pho Saigon 8 is awesome. Incredible prices and even better tasting food. The hubby even said it's the best he's had ( in Vegas) so far.  Most likely gonna make this place a weekly tradition."}
{"text":"The service sucks. They lost a customer over $8. Is that what the 8 stands for? ? My food wasn't good, so I asked for a different item & the server told me I should've read the menu better & what happens if I don't like my next dish? Will I keep asking for more? I told him I come two to three times a week so I know what to expect & he said he sees a million faces a day how would he remember. I wasn't expecting him to remember I was just trying to make it clear I know what their food is supposed to taste like. On to the next pho restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"We were told that this place has really good \"bun bo hue\" so we came to try it out.  It definitely was not a disappointment.  There were plenty of meat, noodles and the thin cabbage made it all come together nicely.  The broth was very favorable and you can tell they use furmented fish paste.  This flavoring was very authentic to those who cook Vietnamese food.
My daughters ordered the traditional pho tai and they said that it was above average.  We also ordered the tri colored dessert and it was tasty.  There was nothing that stood out from the dessert other than it was good and we would get it again.  This place was definitely not disappointing and the price point on the menu was very reasonable.  The place is located about 5 mins away from the Chinatown plaza so getting there was an easy."}
{"text":"Consistent quality with the best bun dishes in area. They have a friendly staff and very large portions."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pho I've had in Vegas. I used to be a loyal Pho Kim Long fan, but Saigon 8 won me over. Their meat is much more tender, and it doesn't come out overcooked and rubbery. It does tend to get a little crowded sometimes, and I definitely like the seating at Kim Long better, but for the overall value and quality Saigon 8 is the place to go for Pho."}
{"text":"So glad to find their new location is open late! Just as tasty an hour before closing as it is during busy lunch hour. Favorites are rare brisket pho and seafood pho with extra limes. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and mostly enjoyed the food. The service is pretty mediocre but I don't blame them-- at least they try. 

The eggrolls are different here, and while they aren't my cup of tea, seem to be popular among other regular patrons.

The prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get--you'll be pretty full from just one bowl of soup. I love the traditional leaves and beansprouts that they serve alongside the pho. I always douse mine in hot sauce as well. When I've got a really bad cold, there's nothing I crave more than a steaming hot bowl of spicy, salty, hydrating pho. However, I've been elsewhere in clark county and must say that this is far from the best pho in town. Its conveniently located for me but don't settle for this place because there is much better to be had in the asian districts closer to the strip."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho! Right by my house!! 
Yay!!!
I asked for extra jalapeños and boy did they give me extra. 
#16 is what I always order and it hasn't failed to be delicious once!"}
{"text":"This place is always  busy but it beats driving all the way to Chinatown. Food is delicious  I like their  tendon and beef pho. I also order their small egg rolls with lettuce. Their combination  with noodles and shrimp is great. I just  wish they speak more  English."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Eggs rolls, pho & coffee were top notch. To bad it's not closer to my home or I'd eat there more."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese place in Las Vegas. And it's not even in the chinatown area. Pretty authentic Vietnamese food, especially for Vegas. The bun was good, and the pho had a really good broth, not too sweet like many others."}
{"text":"I do like this location simply because they do takeout and its nice to take my pho home. Admittedly they only get 4 stars because sometimes I've called in an order, they tell me it will be ten minutes and by the time I get there, my order is not ready nor does anyone seem to recall me having put one in. I go at least 3 times a month if I can. The males seem to do this more then the females working there. It has happened more then once and it does get annoying after awhile. It is also a hit or miss sometimes with the soup itself. There have been times I have gotten meat that appears a little off putting and I get sick after eating it. It's rare but it does happen.

Overall I enjoy coming here, as I can just pick up my soup after I get off work and go. Admittedly I wish they stayed open until 11 instead of ten like their spring mountain locations but otherwise no other complaints."}
{"text":"As good as Pho Kim Long with comparable price ranges but they could probably use a new interior decor and upgrade to a more modern look. They'd probably get the same amount of business as PKL with how delicious their entrees are. I'm going to keep comparing both Pho Saigon 8 to PKL just because in the Pho business out on Spring Mountain, PKL really has the title for \"Best of Las Vegas.\" I believe this place has so much potential if only they'd consider making some arrangements that can pull in the interest of foreigners, travelers, and even locals. Their food is mouth-watering; I can't even begin to explain! I love ordering their Korean BBQ and they're not even a Korean Restaurant! Their Pho tastes so authentic as well! I love how their selections, so much goodness in such a limited menu. I really suggest you give this place a try. Don't expect too much from the environment but their food is off-the-charts amazing :)"}
{"text":"Great place amazing customer service and food! This place is very clean and the pho is amazing! My wife and I had the spring rolls which were Nom Nom! I had the #23 meatball and beef the noodles and meat we great! My wife had the #61(?) egg noodles and wontons! All in all we will for sure be going back. everyone was very nice and refilled drinks fast which is a plus for me! Plus they have some good beers!"}
{"text":"Pho dinner?? Sure this is a great place for just that. Aside from pho can order what eve you want on the menu. Perfect me for cold nights like this. 

Probably one of the best pho restaurants in town. I can tell it's very authentic, soon as you walk in you can smell the grill and what ever the kitchen it cooking up. I can attest that the service, 10/10. 

Order the pho, you won't regret it. Generous portions and the price is right. Hurry and check it out !"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the first time to try out pho. If you don't know what you're doing don't order the large pho bowl. It's hard to finish everything. But I loved trying something new."}
{"text":"This is my fav location for pho in vegas and I've had it everywhere! They give you a lot of chicken they're fast and the flavor is the best pho around :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family. Overall, the food is ok. It's not the best pho, but it wasn't bad either. The bun bo hue was a bit lacking in flavor, although it came with all the right ingredients (the coagulated blood was nicely cooked). The spring rolls were ok, with too much lettuce inside, but the dipping sauce was flavorful. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you live around here, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"Most Vietnamese places serve southern Vietnamese food, because most Vietnamese immigrants are from south Vietnam. It is RARE to find a Vietnamese place in the US that serves Bun Cha Hanoi! So we were pretty excited to find this place. I thought we would have to fly back to Vietnam to have this dish again in my life. So ooooo good! 
It was clean, fast, friendly. 
The Bun Cha Hanoi was great. The spring rolls were awesome and the Pho was awesome too!
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and authentic atmosphere set this place apart for Pho. #18 was excellent and the regular size was plenty"}
{"text":"This place is the OG original,  one of a best restaurants, food is made fresh and hot also customer service is outstanding"}
{"text":"Good place and clean. Pho isn't really my thing but this place is better then Pho Kim Long. The Avocado smoothie was amazing."}
{"text":"I abandoned Pho So 1 for this restaurant, and for good reason. 

Prices for regular bowls of Pho range anywhere from $8 to a little over $10, and there is a size-up option. For me, a regular bowl has always been big enough to satisfy my hunger. The portion sizes may not be as big as the ones at Pho So 1, but are very well worth the money. The soup is great and doesn't taste as much of MSG as many other pho places do, the meat comes out fresh and red like it's supposed to, and the noodles are neither under- nor overcooked. Of course, soybean sprouts and limes are served with the bowls, as well. 

The service is good. I have yet to find an authentic Vietnamese restaurant where the servers actually smile at their customers, but they're getting the job done. Since there is no hostess, and the waiters are often busy, customers often just seat themselves. Once the customer is seated, the servers will quickly come over and take the order. I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes for my food to come out after ordering it. While the customers are eating and talking, the servers are good with keeping the drinks refilled and following up on any other requests.

The bill is paid up at the cash register. There is always someone there, and the cashier is pretty fast, so customers can walk out almost immediately after they finish their food. This is my go-to Pho place. Remember to tip!"}
{"text":"This place is good, decent prices good portions. Try the #46 beef stew with rice noodles it's really hearty!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and brother-in-law wanted to eat Bun Bo Hue so we chose this place.  I've had it here before and it is quite decent.  However, this will be the last time I eat here.  

Both hubby and BIL ordered the Bun Bo Hue Large and I ordered the small.  The bowls came out quickly and as they were finishing up their bowl, I finished almost 1/4 when I noticed a bug that looks similar to a rollie pollie in my bowl of soup.  I spooned it out, waved down our waiter, and at first glance, he said, \"it's good..\"  I said, \"that's a bug in my soup.\"  He took the spoon with the bug and brought it back to the kitchen.  Moments later, another waitress that spoke fluent English came out to apologize and ask if i want anything else.  At that point, I am disgusted already so I said no and check please.  

They took off the small bowl of Bun Bo Hue off of the check, but still charged for the bowls of the same soup that hubby and BIL ate.  We came to the conclusion that the bug must have been in the big pot of soup that they served to all customers as how else will the bug appear in the soup.  But nope, if they continued to charge us for the two bowls, we are sure they continued to serve that to other customers.  

Very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! They said 10 minute wait for my party of 6, we waited almost 20 minutes when a party of 2 were seated. Continuing to wait another 10 minutes 4 people walk in and go to seat themselves. I explain to the hostess that they just cut us. Apparently, they were joining the previous party of 2. The hostess said that she was saving a bigger table for my party. I then explained to her the 2 people + 4 more =6. She continued to be passive and not tell the 4 people whom just walked in that we were next. This place is awful, no wonder why it only has 3 1/2 !"}
{"text":"Wow!!! From my last review I talked about customer service being my only problem but ever since then, I came here 3 more times in 2 weeks and every single time was AMAZING customer service! Even the last time I came in today they were extremely busy yet greeted everyone and sat them right away! Service was so fast and attentive and everyone was so nice! This definitely adds the final star to complete my review! My favorite pho place of all time! Perfectly yummy and GREAT service now too!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The ambiance could be better, but the speed of service and helpful happy staff make up for the decor. All the ingredients are super fresh. 

We usually get the pho beefballs and lean beef, we also get the spring rolls. Yum!!! You won't regret you are here!!"}
{"text":"The chicken pho is really good due to the authentic broth!  Awesome Vietnamese pizza!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! Sometimes a little wait but that just means great food! They always have good service too"}
{"text":"I always order #29 and it's really good but service sucks big time. I don't mind waiting if they're busy but it's the second time that a friend and I were kept waiting while another couple that walked in after we've been seating and ready to order, got not only their drinks first but also their food way ahead of us. Not cool. Not going back."}
{"text":"I come here often with my family and I always order the vegetarian noodle soup. My most recent visit was very good. The food arrived within 10 minutes and the soup was great. We also ordered the spring rolls which were great too. I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The beef stew isn't what everyone else here made it out to be. It was more like a thick starchy soup (as in, some cook threw in corn starch or something like that) and but not extremely flavorful and beef-y tasting (like how a real stew should be). 

I also tried the grilled pork over rice - pretty decent. 

Nothing to really write home about, but nothing to hate on either. It's aite."}
{"text":"This is definitely a good second option for all of the east siders that can't make it to Chinatown for Vietnamese...

This is a true asian noodle shop...  much more focus on the food than the service.  Pho and spring rolls always tasty and come out quick, but definitely need to make eye contact with a server to get your check when you're finally done."}
{"text":"This place was terrible! They messed up our order and when I called to ask if they could correct it the man on the phone said \"I don't give a fuck.\" And hung up on me. Terrible customer service. I'm a vegetarian and I believe there might have been meat in my food because I was violently sick. Probably food poisoning or meat was put into a vegetarian dish. Beware this place! Worst food I've had in vegas."}
{"text":"Good food & service. 

I was promptly seated, and given a glass of water. The food was hot & fresh, and did not skimp on the portion. My order came with soup and sauce for the eggrolls. Everything tasted great. 

Nice ambiance (with music), and spacious seating. Clean bathroom."}
{"text":"the 1 free drink coupon is only good for happy hr. did not explain well on the site, service is ok, food is ok too"}
{"text":"I love the Pho here, always fresh and delicious. My favorite in Henderson. Friendly service too!!"}
{"text":"It's definitely improved from several years ago! I stopped going to this place for a while, and after giving it a shot, I'm happy that they've improved... BIG TIME!

The food is good, prices are reasonable, service is good, bathrooms are clean, and the whole restaurant is fairly clean!!!

This is one of the go-to places for Vietnamese food for my family & I"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and each time I always think \"Why do you keep coming back here??\"  The service is *horrible* and the food is just okay.  They recently raised their prices, so I have less incentive than ever to come back.  The waiters always act like they are so annoyed to be serving you.  Last time I went, I ordered a pho with tripe, but there was no tripe in my bowl.  When I tried to tell my waiter, he just laughed.  I don't think he understood me, but instead of trying to, he just laughed and walked away.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Update: I usually order the white meat chicken pho, but the texture of the chicken isn't my favorite so I decided to try the dark meat chicken during my last visit. No surprise, I disliked it even more than the white chicken. Thinking they had good customer service, I asked the server if I could just have the white chicken instead brought to me on a side plate since I really didn't eat any of the dark chicken. The server's response was, \"are you kidding me?\" which threw me off a little. I've been going to Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain for years and have never had this problem. If a customer doesn't like their food, you would think they would at least apologize or accommodate to their needs to make the rest of your visit better. I guess not here. Maybe I'll just get a different item from the menu. Sigh.

This new location is so clean and the service is quick. They're always filling your water and always grabbing dirty plates out of the way. Not only is the service quick, but the staff is also very friendly! They make sure everyone at the table is satisfied with their service. For their grand opening, they're giving their guests complimentary spring rolls which is very generous of them. I recommend bringing your family here as it is also very family friend! Lastly, the location is very convenient and near everything. Give them a visit and order their amazing appetizers."}
{"text":"In my top 5 places to eat Pho. Not number 1, but it is most definitely up there. The service is good and the seating is fast. I will come again."}
{"text":"Food was horrible to be realistic. It seems like they have never tried authentic Vietnamese food before. The broth for the pho was horribly bland and tasted packaged. Also, they served fish sauce with the eggrolls which is the equivalent of serving French fries with mustard instead of ketchup... Not normal at all. Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner. Price is decent but serving is alright, I've ate somewhere where they have good amount of food serving for what they worth. Overall is pretty good. Pho is actually good except their Large is actually a Medium some other place. Will come by again for sure."}
{"text":"I guess it's little healthier soup base hence the blandness in flavor. rather go to Pho Thanh Huong on Tropicana or the other place down the street from this one. Little Saigon or the one over in china town even also called little siagon. more of the OC LS feel. I'm pretty glad I'm moving back on thursday, really miss good vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Good broth and excellent service. One of the best pho I have ever had. Spring rolls with pork was delicious."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad at all! It definitely has a lot of options in dishes and drinks. The pho broth is ok, but not as flavorful as another pho spot, but not terrible. This one at least had the tradition drinks of Avocado shake and Egg Yolk Soda."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and it wasn't bad, but but last visit was the worst. Not only did I notice the attitude change, but those that were with me noticed that their attitude changed towards me when I came in my military uniform. Had some friends with me who were regulars too and noticed that they gave me less food compared to before when I did not wear my uniform. Not sure what the deal is, but they were either having a bad day or they are anti military. They weren't as friendly and avoided interactions with me."}
{"text":"Ordered beef pho to go. Was ready very quickly and very delicious when I got home :)
This is my favorite pho place they give you a lot of meet in the soup and it doesn't have a lot of fat, also thin slices. Overall 5 stars, the service was fast and easy, they were nice and the place looked clean"}
{"text":"What's there to say they are great. Never had to wait that long from ordering to the end . love the pho best in town . will continue to enjoy there service and awesome food and dining. They are also very clean."}
{"text":"If you drink then this place is great for recovery food.  Have not found a better meal for the day after then this.  I went out 4 nights in a row and ate here 3 mornings in a row.  Had to drive a little ways but made me feel much better."}
{"text":"So we come here at least 2-3 times a week. My girlfriend and my son loves this place and we really enjoy the food consistently. Best Pho place in Las Vegas/ Henderson area."}
{"text":"Food is really great, pricing is perfect. Customer services needs a little more improvement and cash only is really annoying but I only care about the food really haha"}
{"text":"The food is incredible. Best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to outside of San Francisco. Everything is fresh and the portions are generous. My favorite is the #12 and the vegetarian spring rolls. 

The service is fantastic. The manager came over and helped us decide what to order. 

Go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I will definitely be back here when I'm in the mood for soup and noodles. Great location."}
{"text":"There are so many Pho places in Spring Valley and I have tried about 8 of them.  Pho Saigon 8 is by far the best.  
To me the most important things about Pho is the quality of the broth, and I have to say I have ordered many different kids of Pho and the broth is always good, weather it be beef, chicken or mushroom broth, it is always yummy.  The spring rolls are huge, and also very fresh.
The prices are reasonable and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I like the pho here a little better than Pho So 1. The tea tasted a little funny. I can make better french rice. So on an average I would say this place is good."}
{"text":"Couldn't give it a 4.5 so I gave it a 4. Of the Vietnamese food on this side of town their Phó was the heartiest ... most meat and veggies. Although,  you do pay a little more for that benefit. Pho done right is hard to mess up. They do it right.  Good attentive service.  I may be a little \"westernized\"/ \"Europeanized\" but I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer banh mi sandwiches.  But you can get just french bread. I also enjoyed the pork roles. 
 
Good little spot."}
{"text":"love this place!  Their pho finally convinced my husband of how delicious pho can be. This is the only pho place my husband trusts and its his favorite place to go for dinner on a cold day. The service is great, everyone is friendly and fast.  We have ordered for pick up and have done sit down service. Their raw beef, beef ball and chicken phos are our faves. Also enjoyed their spring rolls and egg rolls with lots of fresh veggies.  Great fish sauce btw.  Also their pho saved my life when i caught the flu. We did a lot of pick up of chicken pho that week!  Anytime i start feeling a cold coming on, this is my go to place and it helps me get rid of it.  Looking forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"The ownership has made a major scale improvement to this place and the staff is always as friendly and lightning fast as ever. Quality of the food? Amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, and the service great!!  Very attentive and friendly, and cheaper than pho Kim long.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Very good pho! Clean place too. Only thing is they are quite short staff so it takes a long time for them to bring you extra plates or  forks that you might need. Opens early so we went there for breakfast.  So just keep that you have to wait a bit for stuff as they are short staff"}
{"text":"Great broth! Very authentic with a ton of flavor! Great Thai tea as well. Service is fast and attentive. Usually busy but haven't yet had a problem being seated right away!"}
{"text":"6/28/2017  Stopped in for lunch.  Great Place.  I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The pho is ok. It's good but it's pho. The service brings this place down quite a bit. I'm not too picky but I don't like having to get up to find my server 3 times a meal."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! If you love spicy food, order #73 and add extra spicy paste they give you! Its really good! But I do wish that the bowls were bigger!"}
{"text":"SUCH GOOD PHO! But the service and atmosphere sucks, so I only get take out. I get the #11 every time! So good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their pho has that traditional home made Viet taste and very fast and good service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You are greeted when you walk in and sat at a table. 
They will then take your order. 
You will get your order within 5-10 minutes. 

Awesome!!!

BUT don't expect to see them again for the remainder of your meal. This is how most Vietnamese restaurants operate but this location does it much more apparently. 

There is a sign in front that says \"please pay here.\" This saves the restaurant staff the closing step of service, which is to bring out your bill. 

I understand why they do this, however it makes paying the bill and leaving a tip a less personable experience. 

The restaurant is usually always busy which makes eating here somewhat of an experience but other than that...consider this a fast casual spot."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've found in Vegas.

The place is fairly nice for a Henderson strip mall. Decor is appropriate and tasteful, you'd have friends and family here; unlike most Pho joints that feel like a Vietnamese Robertos. Not that there's anything wrong with Robertos, it's just not a place you'd take a hot date. Saigon 8 is. Actually,  a \"best I can get right now\" date or \"I'm feeling fat/unemployed\" kinda date, but regardless, you won't be ashamed of this place.

The Pho is excellent. Standard pho gringo rules apply with Pho, stick with the Pho tai until you know what you're dealing with. Tripe is not for the unfamiliar stomach.  One amazing thing they do here that's apparently illegal in Vietnam: the veggie pho actually features veggie broth, and IT'S MARKED ON THE CONTAINER.

Also a fun game we play every time I call:
I say: \"Hi can I have a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho please? Extra meat and extra Jalapenos\"
They say: \"(Vocal Noises sounding mildly like english that may or may not be confirming my order.)\"
\"I didn't catch that, was that a Pho Tai and a Veggie Pho\"
\"(Garbles that may be English with incomprehensible accent)... 10 minutes\".
\"Okay thanks\"

And my order has always been right over 10+ visits. Always extra Jalapenos, always extra meat, never any missing sides. This impresses me more than anything else."}
{"text":"Sorry. Just not my kind of Pho. The service was lousy, we waited almost 25 minutes for a bowl of soup. ?!?!"}
{"text":"I think I'm writing about Vietnamese places too much, but I just love Pho.  I tried the beef stew here.  A bit more oily than to my liking.  However, it still had a good kick to it.  The Cha Gio (Egg Rolls) were a bit more crispy than Pho So 1's, but better than Pho Kim Long's.  I didn't get to try the pho here yet, but I did get the Bun Bi (Vermicelli Noodles with lemongrass beef and vegetables).  It's just as good as any other place.  The place is clean, the waiters are prompt in the beginning, but kind of forget about you later on.  Still, I didn't need much.  Too bad I can't give a 3.5 star rating, but I'll edge them out to a 4."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. This is my choice for best Pho spot in Vegas. Far better than the incredibly overrated Pho Kim Long on Spring Mt"}
{"text":"Korean noodles served up cheap and fast across from LVAC and BodyHeat. What more could you ask for? The perfect amount of spice in the BBQ pork meatballs and noodles, and if there isn't, there's always sriracha or chili paste. 

This place has an enormous menu for the trying, but the first thing I wanted, they were out of. Credit card minimum of $10 so make sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"This is a nice, clean location with mixed service. The pho I ordered came out very fast, the other stuff we ordered was much later. My dad ordered a pork chop and we also ordered an appetizer, it was a good 10 minute difference between the pho and the rest. 

The food was good. My parents just returned from Vietnam and commented that the broth here was much more flavorful than what they ate over there. 

I feel the portions are decent for the money, my only request would be more tendon pieces with the pho. Everything was cooked well, my parents did not like the appetizer - it was a sausage wrapped in a spring roll. I thought it was okay. 

It wasn't too full on a Friday night, but the food was fresh."}
{"text":"Be aware,  the price just went up big , $1,50 to $4..more ! We walk out , not happy  ! Used to busy but 7pm dinner time  had 3 tables..! My salary not up 20% ..or more yet ! I think it s new owner  ?"}
{"text":"I dont really know much about pho, but i thought whatever i ordered was really good. the service kinda sucked though."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting some Pho for some time and decided to stop one afternoon to kill my craving. The seating was a bit crowded, they were very busy and it was somewhat loud with the boisterous conversations but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Even though it was busy service was fast and efficient. I ordered the #44 Hu Tieu hay Mi Tom Cua (noodle soup with shrimp, crab and egg) and was not disappointed. I garnished it with the bean sprouts, basil and jalapeno along with some extra sauce to give it a bit more kick and paired it with some warm sake. I took my time enjoying the flavors as well as the atmosphere. I haven't tired many Vietnamese restaurants so I am by no means a  connoisseur but I will say I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  I practically eat here almost once a week.  Coming from a city where there was a lot of yummy Vietnamese food readily available, I was determined to find something similar in Henderson.  Pho Saigon 8 has come the closest to any I have tried...and trust me, I have tried many. 

My latest favorite crave here is the beef stew with wide flat noodles!  One thing I looooveeee about the soup is that you can taste the richness of the soup, meaning it took many hours to make it into its thick tendinous consistency, which is very hard to find in today's American money hungry culture!  (Less quality, more quantity).  ;-) 

But if you are a \"Hendersonian\" and is craving Vietnamese food, I'd suggest you to stop by Pho Saigon 8, right next to the LVAC on Eastern!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the reviews about this restaurant. Pho is great and love the spring rolls . Unfortunately everything other than the food is not impressive. I have been there several times (because I enjoy the food) and feel the same way about service not rude but very distant, ready for clean up and new customer to sit.

{"text":"First time here at the Rainbow location! Ordered Pho tai ( rare steak) and spring rolls. They also brought me a complimentary egg roll for coming in ! Everything was delicious!!! So excited to have good Pho on the southwest side of town. They serve beer and wine too! 
Great place. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"All the dishes are pretty good. I especially liked bean thread noodles soup with chicken. Make sure you ask for the ginger sauce to eat with the chicken. It makes a big difference."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Pho place I have eaten at so far in Vegas.

I had the #1 egg rolls, and the lettuce and herbs were fresh cold and crunchy, while the egg roll was hot and crispy, wrapping the egg roll in lettuce and herbs and dipping in the sweet fish sauce provided a wide variety of delicious flavors and textures.

I also had the # 24 beef Pho that had a great beef broth, a generous serving of noodles, and was unusually hearty for a serving of Pho, though I did get the large.

My companion had the #76 which was a combo of many different things in the Pho, she has had more Pho from many more places and she said it was great.

The service was a little below average, come for the food, not for the service.  That's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.  I had to ask for a refill of my water multiple times."}
{"text":"Mostly Pho restaurants are all the same but what makes this restaurant deserving of a
5-star? Excellent service! It was Saturday afternoon and they were pretty busy but as soon as we were seated, we ordered food and in 5 mins food was ready. There were 5 of us and we ordered 3 Large Pho, 5 diff appetizers and 3 rice and bulgogi dish all ready in 5 mins."}
{"text":"Gave up with this place. My favorite dish here was beef stew. It was fine in the past until last two times I ordered from them. They got the cheapest and toughest beef that I've ever had. 1st time I let it go and thought maybe there was something wrong with their inventory. But this is the 2nd time I got this kind of beef means they decided to lower their meat quality. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Just as good as their sister restaurant in Henderson.  Great quality meat and broth for their pho."}
{"text":"Definitely my type of comfort food in Vegas after 3 full days of raging. I came here on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't crowded at all. We quickly ordered our food and our orders came out in a timely manner.

Personally, the Pho here is decent for Las Vegas, but still nothing compared to home. They gave out a decent amount of noodles, but I wish they had given us more meat! Nonetheless, this definitely hit the spot for me because it had definitely brought me back to life!"}
{"text":"What will it take to get this place to realize this is Vegas, you as a restaurant, survive on customer service!! Get it together, the waiter so so but Lordy the woman at the register was a Bitch. Never again will I give them my money"}
{"text":"Pretty good pho in considerations of where it is geographically on the US map.
Been coming here for years every time I go to Vegas and the best spot for a hangover cure.

Service is quick all around from entering to exiting."}
{"text":"There are other pho places close by but I really like it here.
The service is quick and inexpensive.I t's very convenient when you want something quick and not terribly unhealthy after going to the gym."}
{"text":"I always order the combination pho.  I think they brought everything out in less than 5 minutes.  Maybe I've eaten a lot of pho my whole life and I cannot tell \"good\" from \"great\" anymore, but I come here every time because of proximity to the starbux, gym, and my appartment.  They have a nice selection of rice dishes too.  

Interestingly, they don't bring the check. You have to go to the cashier to pay, so remember your table."}
{"text":"Yes, I totally agree with Rachel D. in that it is a total challenge to find a decent pho place in Las Vegas.  It sucks that we from Hendertucky have to drive 20 mins over just to eat pho!! 

Anyway, the pho is good and oh-so much better than pho so 1 down the street. Less greasy and more flavorful!"}
{"text":"I think it's probably one of the best pho in Vegas. Their broth is so good and rich. Ate here back to back after each night out."}
{"text":"Stopped here for takeout the other night and was very impressed! The lady who answered the phone was friendly and helpful (especially because I totally forgot one of the names of the dishes I wanted to order). The food was ready quickly and although we didn't dine in, the decor looked nice! 

We loved the spring rolls and definitely would go back for those alone! The beef pho broth was good, but I was really impressed by the vegetarian broth! It was so flavorful that I didn't even miss the meat!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went to the Spring Mountain Pho Saigon 8 this afternoon; we were very dissatisfied.   The service was very poor. The wait staff set us at a table with another couple and got our orders mixed up three times. I had beef pho and my friend had chicken pho. We were given only one side dish of bean sprouts and herbs. The serving size was smaller than other similar restaurants I have been to. The broth in both dishes was greasy and not very flavorful. Most disappointing was the fact that the broth while warm was not pipping hot like it usually is in pho. Won't go back. I am also going to call Las Vegas business license, the restaurant seemed like it had way too many tables, the back exit was blocked."}
{"text":"Best pho in vegas. Staff is friendly and attentive. Rare steajk pho is very delicious"}
{"text":"When you're in Vegas and someone has a car, the obvious choice is to eat off-strip. Pho was the consensus. And so I suggested Pho Kim Long, the only pho place I knew in the area. That was quickly shot down. Dang should've known better than to suggest a pho place to Vietnamese people. LOL! 

Pho Saigon 8 was 3-4 miles from the strip; 15-20 minute ride with traffic. The restaurant was spacious; clean and bright with modern décor. The staff was hilarious and super accommodating! My friends asked for things I've never heard of for their pho and the servers immediately brought out the requests and in large quantities; some sort of herb, the fat from the broth and onions soaked in oil. 

My order of charbroiled chicken over rice vermicelli was so refreshing! Loads of noodles and chicken! Yum! Awesome lunch!"}
{"text":"Pho is great here, best in Vegas !!! The Combo Stir fry pho is really good here, must try:)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Bun Bo Hue with a lot of meat in it.  The dishes here are good but pricier than the Vietnamese restaurant in China town.  This restaurant locate in Henderson very convenient therefore you have to pay for the location but still fair.  They also serve fresh coconut juice for $4.95 per coconut."}
{"text":"What a bad experience. Never come back again. The server drop the lid of the chilly sauce. Oh my god,  she picked it up and put it back. So fu*$ ing idiot. It against health code. Come on, think about it...she can at least took it away and wash it. I had to complaint about it.. what a bad service... so terrible.."}
{"text":"Terrible service and cheap. I ordered slice beefs and meatballs and paid additional to add tripe in my pho.When my ordered came, noticed only 1 slice in half meatball. Ask the waiter that there was only one meatball and he replied \"there's 2 meatballs\". So I showed him and said \"there's one meatball cut in half, it's not two\". He kept telling me that it is. I will not come back nor will my friends. They are so cheap in serving their food. Quality is bad and expensive for pho."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho restaurant in Vegas.  I've been coming here for quite awhile and they are always consistent with the flavor of their broth.  Most of the time I get the pho tai, which is sliced very thin.  The soup is flavorful and seasoned well.  

The chicken pho with white meat is also very good, along with their grilled chicken rice dish.  The egg rolls are also very tasty.  Whenever asked, I always recommend Saigon 8 as a great place for pho."}
{"text":"Their food is good and all especially their spring rolls but their service is horrid.

I may be the annoying customer that disliked where they seated me and asked to move but 1) it was right after they set waters down not like there was tons of food placed yet and 2) if their dining area wasn't so cramped and dark then the corner right next to the kitchen would have been okay.

And I may not have understood that Thai iced tea was not the same as their regular iced tea because the person who usually takes me there and orders for me was not there this time. And of course, I have to send the Thai iced tea back even though I had described to the male waiter that I wanted the \"clear\" iced tea.

But for the staff to so rudely express their exasperation with me was not just humiliating to me in front of the person I brought to THEIR restaurant but also very frustrating as a paying customer. The waiter who brought me the tea I ordered wrong literally argued with me that it was what I ordered and though I apologized and explained what I wanted, he stormed off to the front counter with it and threw his as about yelling the story to the other two waiters, one of whom always grunts and groans when you ask her for anything.

And yet I never did get the right tea until after my food came and I had to ask the youngest waiter there who is very nice and cordial. 

I don't care how good their food is, I don't pay them to get treated like an unworthy peasant while families of six or seven get star treatment from these despicable two servers. Will not be returning simply because they are so unpleasant to even order from and the girl is just there to text on her cellphone in between acting bothered by customers. Pathetic."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to find a different pho place besides this one. I love this place, not only because of their food and warm delicious bowls of grilled shrimp vermicelli, or soup with the greatest rare steaks, but also because this place is so clean. The dishes and the small little sauce bowls are clean, their chopsticks are probably the best disposable chopsticks I've ever seen at a pho place, and the spoons are also clean. Seriously, go here just simply because."}
{"text":"I live by little Saigon in southern California and we always come here when we're in Vegas. They have friendly staff and their food is great. I always order the bun bo hue. It's spicy and loaded with meat! The pho is great as well. They don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Had fresh roll. A little bland and dry. The Pho w beef brisket and ribeye was decent. Broth had decent flavor and portion size was well worth the $10. Service was very quick to deliver the food and slow to deliver the check. I think some people's complaints about rude service may be a misunderstanding of the culture and also due to a language barrier. But who knows. It's not overly friendly there but it's a strip mall restaurant and they're busy. I went in to eat and I got hot, decent food so I'm happy. If you're looking for a dinning experience that's going to change your life this isn't the place. If your looking for a decent and hot meal at a fair price then this is it. Definitely will be back. Only 4 stars because I've had better Pho but it's still good and well worth the price."}
{"text":"make sure u say the number correct they bitchx a me bc i said the wrong number and once i said i wanted something different they told me to eat  , good still good but the service sucks assss"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best spots in Vegas (Spring Mtn, near the strip) for pho. They have over 50 items on the menu. The beef stew with french bread is a good. The seafood pho is huge and tasty with tons of shrimp, squid, etc. Everything is about $6-8. I highly recommend this spot for some simple pho and Vietnamese dishes 1 mile off the strip."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 has always been one of my favorite Vietnamese Restaurants. I am quite happy when they recently opened a branch closer to home at Rainbow and 215. I used to go to the Henderson branch at least once a week for lunch and when I do, I usually bring friends and/or co-workers since it's only a few minutes away from the office. We recently moved our office near the Spring Mountain Branch so I now take my friends and co-workers there. As a Fathers Day gift, my family wanted to take me out to dinner so I suggested that we go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Since Fathers Day was quite busy at home due to relatives visiting, we decided to go a day after. We decided to go to the one close to home, Rainbow and 215. I decided to order something different from the usual Pho Dac Biet this time. That's when the problem started. I decided I wanted to try some beef balls so I ordered #20 from the menu. The server brought me the wrong order, #22 which had no beef balls. When I told the manager (I think he was the manager because he was tending the register and was kind of rude), he stated that what I ordered didn't have beef balls. However, he'll just bring me some beef balls separately in a bowl instead of correcting the error. Since he was going to bring me a bowl of beef balls which is what I wanted, I said that would work, no problem. When we got the bill, this guy charged us for the extra beef balls. When I asked why, he stated that the beef balls were separate and I would have gotten a lesser amount if it came with my original order. It was very disappointing. I was trying to be nice and this guy had taken advantage. Our bill was $51.20 including the extra beef balls. My daughter works as a barista in one of the nice coffee shops in town and is a very generous tipper. She could have given them at least twice the amount of the beef balls in tips if not more had they taken them out of the bill. My son recommended to just pay the bill and not argue about the $4 or so beef balls. We paid and left without leaving gratuities. Not only that they lost a few dollars in tips, they also lost regular customers. Goodbye Pho Saigon 8. This was our last. There are plenty of Vietnamese Restaurants in town who are just as good if not better. Your beef balls were good though. LOL!"}
{"text":"Wow! This has to be the best Vietnamese place I've eaten at! I had the grilled chicken and egg rolls with rice dish. The chicken was well prepared and had that nice grilled taste to it. The only thing I didn't like about the dish was the rice was a bit dry.

The thing that most impressed me was how fresh all the vegetables were. If you had pho, they gave you a dish of basil leaves with bean sprouts. Wow, I've never seen basil leaves so large and so green. Same goes for how fresh the bean sprouts were.

Definitely want to come here again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I ate here once about a year ago for PHO, it was acceptable. The service wasnt very good and they refused to do anything about a family allowing their baby to scream on and on. I wont be back, but its ok"}
{"text":"This place always has great service along with making the food very quick. I usually get their #16 pho."}
{"text":"The people here are so nice and welcoming! My mother, sister, and I were seated right away. The broth was delicious and the cilantro and green onions added a amazing scent. Everything was cooked perfectly. I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Living in Orange County, I'm very spoiled when it comes to pho. We came here on a Sunday morning before making the long drive back home. It was over five months ago so I'm trying my best to recall the details of my visit.. Service was typical of a pho restaurant. We only saw the waitress when we ordered and when the food came. I remember the broth and meat being decent.

My issue with this place was the price and the waitress when I was placing my order. I believe it was $8-$9 for a large bowl (but their large was equivalent to a small/medium on OC!). I asked her if they had 'pho tuoi' which translates to fresh pho noodles (it's slightly thicker than the one they usually use). I had to explain to her that it's thicker noodles and she claimed that they do offer pho tuoi. When my bowl arrived, it was pretty obvious that they just gave me the thick white hu tieu noodles! Ugh, it already took forever to receive our food so I didn't even bother to send it back. I'm definitely never coming back here again. I should have known better than to expect good pho in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best broth in town. Family always gets the pho. I always get the wonton soup w/egg noodle and it's consistently the best we've ever tasted. Been to every pho place in Vegas and Houston. This place wins hands down. Always fast and friendly staff too. Fried spring rolls are a must have. I've been to their other locations on Spring Mountain  and the one on Rainbow. Again, flavor of the food, quality of the service are consistently excellent every time."}
{"text":"\"I`m Pho-king hungry!\" I make this joke anytime I know Pho is on the schedule for the day. Then I laugh. Then it's awkward. 

Anyway, I came here with my friend yesterday for some Pho. This is her normal spot and my first time here. I set one foot in the door the the lady had two menus in her hand already and asked \"Two?\". Yes, but when did you even see us?! Whatever. We were seated IMMEDIATELY is what I`m getting at here and that was just fine with me. We were brought water twice(as in TWO glasses of water EACH), which was a little odd, but I figured they just didn`t want to fuss with refilling our water? Who knows. I didn`t care much about that oddity. Within about 3 minutes they came to take our order and luckily, I always know what I want. Gimmie the Pho, number 11, the one with the rare cow that cooks in the broth. You know.  Also, a Sapporo, please and thanks. 

They brought my cold beer out pretty quickly but the glass wasn't cold(I know, I know. I like fancy touches, but still.) Sapporo as expected. Pho came out pretty soon after that with all the sides. I got a small and it was still pretty large. I love Pho and the bang for your buck that you get. Big bowl of broth, noodles(LOTS of noodles at this particular place), and some meat. I will say that there wasn't enough meat to satisfy my little carnivore heart, but it is what it is. The broth was AMAZING, which more than made up for the lack of meat. Add some lime to that bowl of broth = totally drinkable. So good! Some of the best Pho broth I have ever had. Noodles were..noodles. Overall, I would come back here. I found the service to be okay. They didn`t offer me another beer which was a little sad, but also helped me minimize my day drinking."}
{"text":"First time I went here last month, I thought this place was okay. They gave me too much noodles in the soup that I was overwhelmed. 

Second time, I LOVE IT. 

My boyfriend got the Pho Tai (rare steak pho) and the broth was perfect. My grandma was impressed with how clear the broth was (listen to the old asian lady, they know what they are talking about when it comes to pho!). I liked how it was not too salty but still flavorful.

I got the Bo Luc Lac Rice (shaken beef). The beef was tender and they did not drown it in sauce like some places do. The lady  recommended steamed rice but I opted for their red rice (i think it's tomatoes that makes it red...but I am not sure). Next time, I will do the steamed rice. 

Thai tea was amazing! Some places, the thai tea is too sweet. I can still taste the tea at this place. 

Service was nice. I liked that they refilled my water so much. Great selection of food. Will be back."}
{"text":"Foods pretty awesome.
Atmosphere is claustrophobic inducing though.
Combination Meat pho is lacking exotic meats though. Mostly just flank steak"}
{"text":"Noodles cold and hot are great at this place!!! I tend to take anyone who loves noodles to this place. My kids love the noodles and we eat at this place atleast once a week. Fast service but the customer service could be more personable and friendly but other than that the food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were hesitant on going here at first since they have branches all around town. We like local owned restaurants instead. We were nearby and needed something quick so we gave it a try. My boyfriend loved the broth. He usually doesn't care much for pho. It does taste different from all of the other pho places we've tried in town. Definitely coming back here, hopefully when it's not too crowded. (It can get really crowded)"}
{"text":"If you are a Pho lover (like I am) this is a must try! The best Vietnamese sandwiches and Phö!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I look forward to eating here every time we crave Pho, it's definitely our go to. They're knowledgeable and speedy! Love it!"}
{"text":"Really great Pho carry out! I was feeling sick and knew that some Pho no meat would do the trick. I called ahead and had my friend run in and grab it. It was all packaged separately and it was delicious. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Portions were nice size as well. I only put 4 stars because I asked for no bean sprouts and they forgot I told them that. I just picked them out. 
Other than that they were nice and good service."}
{"text":"Always a very goid value for pho, got the vegetebale pho with rice noodles and a spring roll witb tofu. Very happy and excellent value. I am also happy, tgey do some cosmetic to the restaurant, this add some value . Will be back like i do since tge padt 5 years."}
{"text":"My coworker and I had more of the yummy #29 today for lunch. We also decided to share a #1, the Vietnamese fried egg rolls. They come served with lettuce to wrap them in, and a sweet chili dipping sauce. 

#29 was a hit once again, no surprise there. The egg rolls were delicious. Nice and crispy, pretty filling for the size."}
{"text":"I have had Pho just a few times.  Have to say, this place is pretty good.  I had the Pho Chicken Breast and Thigh.  Thick pieces of chicken, tasty, spicy, and price was decent.  Place is located in a pretty busy strip mall right off the 215.  Around lunch time, parking can get tough, but immediately after 2 pm it opens up.  The restaurant is a bit small and since it can get busy, you will feel a littled cramped. Still worth it since the food is good and staff is great."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is the food. Other than that, I would never have a reason to come back. The service, timing of the food and attentiveness is terrible. The server never brought my drink. I received my appetizer and dinner 30 seconds apart. Dinner was cold by the time I got to it. I couldn't get napkins or a refill on water."}
{"text":"Its as good as it gets for Henderson.....lots of way better Pho places in Cali but I live in Vegas and this is as good as it gets for me until the next time my mama comes out and makes her Pho it at my house!

I always have the same thing...Hu tieu wonton, Pho Tai, Pho Ap Chao..
always good..nice clear broth, good flavor and they don't skimp on stuff like other places.
I did try the Bun Cha Hanoi once, big mistake...my mom makes the BEST bun cha hanoi so I thought I'd try theirs...well the skewered pork was tasty but the patties were awful!  There was no flavor to it what so ever!! Too bad, I was really hoping to enjoy that since my mom only comes out every few months to make her version of what my friends call \"Lei Mama Patties\". Oh well, c'est la vie...
I still love this place either way and am here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"To all the people who say I should expect bad service because it is a Vietnamese restaurant, I'm sorry you feel that way. If I walk into a place to spend money, I shouldn't feel like a jerk for inconveniencing them. If you hate your job, quit. I work in a restaurant, too, and I know we all have bad days, but nobody should feel unwelcome when they want to spend their money and enjoy lunch. To put it shortly, the service was awful. We walked in and were sat, and before our menus were open the giant guy who sat us was already asking if we were ready. Not yet, guy. So he walks away, does a loop around the tiny restaurant, and 30 seconds later asks if we are ready. Repeat twice. Then, he got annoyed, sneezed into his hand, and never came back (thank goodness.) 

When we did finally order, I got Veggie spring rolls and bun with egg rolls. Spring rolls were yummy, no complaint there. My noodles though... soggy lettuce and warm noodles, eek.

My boyfriend ordered a pork stew over egg noodles, but what he got was gigantic chunks of pork fat. That's just gross. I took a picture of the scooped out fat... probably about 8 oz of fat and 3 oz of actual pork meat. I think most would agree that less quantity and more quality is preferable to more waste and less quality. When my food lovin' non-picky eater of a boyfriend barely touches a meal, there's an issue. Even he was grossed out by the bad quality.

I'll just keep going to Pho Kim Long in China Town. It's a longer drive, but at least I didn't get treated like I kicked someone's pet as soon as I walked in, and the food is fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Second time here. My family tend to come here every year when we pass by Vegas on our way to California. I don't really remember the first time being here but I believe my experience was pleasant. However this time around the food and service was not the best. I ordered banh canh and there was barely any crab meat in it. It also took about ten minutes after ordering for them to the other half of our table our waters. Okay service. Decent banh canh but not the best. I'd come here next year again to try out other foods and see how they taste."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is extremely picky about where she gets her pho, this was our first time ordering from Pho Saigon 8 and we where very please with the pho & egg rolls."}
{"text":"Very good pho. Reasonable and fast. I comes to this location often but my last experienced was disappointing as they died not haver limes and there Broth did not seem as flavoursome as usual. I'm hoping this was a once off and will try again."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been coming here for over a year. When we first went the service was very good, friendly, and it felt like our business was appreciated. I don't know what happened but....

Out of the last three times we came the waiter (the same one each time) didn't take our drink orders, was very impatient while we were ordering, and my wife had to chase down a different waiter for water. FYI, all three times the waiter was that fat one that another reviewer found very rude/short. Speaking about the wait staff, did someone scare off all the female employees?

The strangest part is that food is exactly the same: fantastic. I wish Yelp would let us differentiate between the food, place, and staff as the food would easily get 5 stars while the staff (well, that staff that's left) would get 1.

It's very rare that I'd let the wait staff get to me as usually a return visit gets me a different waiter, but this place is so small that's not an option. Right now I'll just resign myself to finding a different Pho place."}
{"text":"Yum!

The service sucks.  There's one server who's super sweet and attentive, but anyone else will forget to bring you water, straws, napkins, totally ignore you after you get your food.. but who cares, it's sooo cheap and tasty!

I like the pho here, particularly the broth.... it, like most places, leaves you with that msg hangover (sleepy, overfull feeling lol).  I also like the bun, and bun bo hue (sp?), yummm.  I noticed that my last visit's pho had less noodles??  I normally can't finish a small, but I couldn't help but notice.  Maybe it's just me.  Egg rolls are alright, they have quite a few rice dishes in case you don't like noodles.  I love coming home from here wreaking of fish sauce!

xx"}
{"text":"Was going here regularly until we discovered they weren't using veggie broth. Great soup honestly. Some of the best we've had in Vegas but we can't eat here anymore because we can't have animal broth."}
{"text":"I was so happy they opened up this place by my house on Rainbow. I used to have to drive to there other location in China town . Which I didn't mind because their food is very delicious. The service at the Rainbow location was fantastic everytime I go there. They are always on point! I love that they have wine there and saki. I normally order the beef spare ribs with rice and there egg rolls with lettuce. The egg rolls is so flavorful and always hot with a nice crunch. My family goes here minimum once a week! My son in law loves there Pho ! He says it's the best in town!! I will be a customer for life! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Best PHO in VEGAS.... hands down.

Don't go to the one off Eastern tho.  Broth was very bland."}
{"text":"It's ok but taste watery no flavor not really impressive. Service not all that .
Will not come back here ."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is our favorite pho place.  We have been at all the popular pho locations but Pho Saigon 8 is our favorite.  We always get the pho tai and the broth is the best.  It is so savory compared to the rest.  The other places have a sweetness to it we don't like.  We also get the fried rolls which is awesome.  We use to go to the spring mountain location, but this Rainbow location is much closer and newer.  Best pho in town!"}
{"text":"7 months ago, I left a 5 star review for this place. Me and my husband and family regularly eat here twice a week since the last 7 months. 

However in the last 4 times we came to eat here, I get a stomach ache at the bottom of my stomach immediately after and it last for up to 24 hours. This has been happening the last 4 times I've been there like I said. I am so sad and disappointed coz this was my favorite pho place. But now I have to say goodbye Pho Saigon 8. I can't keep coming back to a restaurant just to get stomach aches. 

My old review 7 months ago: highly recommend this place. Everything came out excellent. We ordered fresh spring rolls, pho with round eye and tendon and lastly pho with flank steak. I love how neat and clear their menu is and how they put a lot of pictures on their menu as well. Their bathroom was impressive too. Looked very clean compared to other asian/pho restaurants I've been too. Will definitely come back to this place next time I crave for pho."}
{"text":"The guys wanted pho and since I wasn't the driver, I had to deal with it. Yelp on an iPhone is about one of the best things invented. It directed us to a nice, clean restaurant that got high reviews. I didn't get pho, but everyone seemed to really like their soup. I tasted the broth and it was flavorful, not one of those tasteless, saltless crap, plus the meat they gave was a good amount, according to the person who ordered it. I got the bun (vermicelli) with beef. I immediately liked the fact that they gave me TWO little bowls of fish sauce. The beef was tasty and tender and they gave a lot of it. I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Fast Service if you order the Pho. Our food came in about 5 minutes after the server took our order.  The large Pho is about a small at other pho places, so order accordingly! 
Food was decent, nothing extraordinary, but the place is clean and close to the strip."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch BC I wasn't feeling well! I got here after noon so the place was very busy even for a weekday.  My order the small Pho with rare beef, brisket and added meat balls.

The sides of veggies and mints are really fresh here and my Pho hit the spot! I enjoy the Pho here BC it's always temperature hot and they give generous amount of ingredients. 

The service is spot on and they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"These guys are great for quick service! if you feel like take out or dine in, they will definitely get your order out quick and efficiently! Their tai tea is on point and is always a smart pick if you've got a sweet tooth like myself! I always order from there when I'm in need of something to fill me up and fast!"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying I'm Vietnamese. 

The good: they give you lots of meat in your Pho.

The bad: the broth was not very good. I'd give it a 3/10, it was cloudy, salty, and probably not fresh.

The really bad: the banh xeo here is quite literally the worst i've ever had in my -entire life-. Not only was the batter terrible, but it appears that they may have just pre-made the \"shell\" and baked it, microwaved some bean sprouts and shoved it in there.

My advice: go to Jenni Pho or Que Huong instead.

The only reason this review does not have a 1-star is because those are reserved for restaurants that give me food poisoning or are filthy."}
{"text":"My Favorite PHO place outside CHina Town, super cheap and tastes great even with take-out!"}
{"text":"Busy...super crowded...not much service. I need water when I'm drinking pho---and no one ever came by to fill our cups, as they sat empty!

Not too pricey. Pho is decent. But just super crowded."}
{"text":"It's convenient, they have vegetarian pho and really good tofu spring rolls.   
The service range from efficient to retarded (just one guy who must be high cause or dropped as a kid)

Everyone is nice except the guy with the mustache who works there who had a death stare match with me.

(I won by the way)"}
{"text":"Arrived in vegas to meet customers, and before hand just wanted to have something to eat at this place. Always has the best vietnamese dishes.

Very friendly, and their herbal tea served chilled are totally awsome.

Definitely recommended if you like vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Best pho place in town. I usually get the Pho Tai or the rice plate with the cubed beef. Their pho soup is really good. I'm not sure what makes their soup so much better then the other Vietnamese restaurants, but this place always hits the spot. Egg rolls and spring rolls taste very good here as well! I recommend going to this restaurant simply because the food is amazing. Customer service is above average as well. Unless they are full, they pretty much seat you right away."}
{"text":"I usually don't give out bad reviews but the service here was really BAD! My gf and I sat there for 15mins and nobody approached us NOT even for water. They took the orders of the group that came after us first and got them drinks before us. So we left. This was the second time that we experienced a horrible service here. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE OR RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!"}
{"text":"I pretend to be the Pho expert, because i've been around the Vietnamese noodle town once or twice...or a billion times. I would say this place was a great place considering it's location. I wasn't expecting much and i gotta say they impressed me. From the small detail of simply cleaning their vegetables beautifully to the soup that was not 85 percent fat, which is common among beef pho and it leaves an absolutely disgusting smell in your breath. I was expecting terrible and i received an okay experience. Not the best pho i've tasted and certainly not the cheapest (lord do they know how to rape your wallet)
If you're in vegas and want something other than alcohol, definitely go here."}
{"text":"Great Pho, loved it! Had a great time with a buddy who also thought it was great. will visit again soon I home!"}
{"text":"I was there at 11:30pm  with my friends .. the food is excellent, customer service is wonderful,the waiter name Khiem always taking care our table and Lisa always come and say hello to us  make us feel welcome and relax... this is the place For me and my friends to hang out...Thank You for your service."}
{"text":"This place is my usual place for Pho if I don't want to go all the way down to the Chinatown area. Their Pho Tai is very tasty. However, last night as I ordered the Vietnamese Egg Rolls, I noticed a gnat on the lettuce. It grossed me out a little bit. I know that these things sometimes happen, but obviously the lettuce wasn't just washed. According to the bf the egg rolls are lacking in size (he's comparing them to the Pho So 1 egg rolls). I think its decent for what it is and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I dig. Pho Saigon 8 was one of my favorites driving to Chinatown. I was happy to learn that it opened on restaurant road (rainbow blvd) and close to the 215 exit. It looks like they even take online orders which it seems like lots of places are doing it. Welcome to the technology world! 

The pho tai itself was decent. I like my pho broth to be savory and not sweet so this broth met its criteria. The egg rolls on the other hand were too peppery. Overall I think the pho is decent and service was ok (it wasn't during any meal rushes). I like pho because generally it's fast enough so that with two kids in tow it's not a long wait. It's a win win and glad that we have other options for some pho especially with the temperature dropping. Parking might be tough but it is restaurant road."}
{"text":"Busy lunch, on a sunday afternoon or otherwise, pho saigon 8 never disappoints. Today im having chicken pho with bean thread noodles. They are super accomodating with requests!  Love that. 

Everybody's hustling through the busy lunch and noone skips a beat. My only beef with the hustle and bustle today is the lack of napkins. Wow. Dont get me wtong, Im a fan of using my pants , but not even one when my food came. 2 servers said they bting some asap... Still waiting... Doesnt ruin my pho experience, this place is still the best in town. Mental note, Bring napkins next time."}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas, this was my go-to place for a good bowl of pho. I lived alone at the time, so I rarely ever cooked pho at home since a pot of it can feed a dozen people. Vietnamese food has come a long way since I moved there in 2006. Pho Saigon 8 is one of the best in town. The broth is clear and flavorful, made with just the right amount of each ingredient. Some places botch the soup by adding too much of a certain ingredient. Clarity is a good indication of the quality of a pho broth. If it's cloudy, it's probably no bueno. 

Besides the pho, the other dish I usually order here is the Hu Tieu My Tho with the soup on the side. I love Hu Tieu, probably even more than Pho, and this place has the best in town. Nothing compared to my hometown favorites (Nam Vang & Da Lat), but it's the best thing I can eat when I am not at home. For those who don't know, Hu Tieu is another variation of Pho. It comes with noodles and meat. I prefer to keep the broth separated and eat the noodles dry. I sip the broth with each bite and it's quite a delicious way to eat noodles."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when im craving PHO', its just so good:]
They have a good range of pho soups and they have the other rice and vermicelli dishes/bowls.  Really tasty. Great egg rolls! Service is fast as long as its not completely packed and the servers are pretty nice. Just dont get the thai tea because it will be a disappointment!! I ordered it and it came in this tiny plastic cup instead of the tall cup in the picture! soo not worth the 3 and sumtin dollars.

i would have to agree about the msg with one of the yelpers though, some but NOT all of their soups have extremely high amounts of MSG, the egg noodle soups i think/soups other than the traditional pho soup, i had one and oh myyyy never ordered that again!

 But overall i would recommend this place, if your looking for authentic Pho go here instead of \"pho kim long\"!"}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars because their food is amazing but I hate calling in an order and everyone I speak to always act like they don't understand English. Especially if the request is simple... for example, no carrots."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in Vegas! I'm from Hawaii where I'd eat pho maybe once a week..... okay, fine. I'd eat pho at least twice a week. It was my favorite food for a couple of years and I was fixated on it. During that time, I tried a lot of different places and acquired a taste for what I like.

Pho is beautiful like that. While I believe there are objectively bad places, there is certainly no \"best\". It just depends on what you like, how your taste buds prefer things before it goes down.

Pho Saigon 8 is that perfect balance for me here in Vegas and I'll tell you why:

The broth! Amazing- perfectly balanced to me. Not too much anise, not too much cinnamon, not too dark, not too light, not too greasy, but just greasy enough to be comforting. I always order my meat on the side because when it comes in the broth is always gets overcooked. First I squeeze some lemon/lime on it, then into the bowl it goes piece by piece as I'm ready to eat it, but remember to add the rest of it before it gets too cold to cook it at least a little.

Ngo gai! But wait.. we'll get around to that.

Pho is a labor of love. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy because I spend about 5 minutes after the steaming bowl arrives just customizing it. You have to find your ideal balance of sour (citrus), salty (fish sauce), spicy (sate, sriracha, chili paste, fresh jalapenos) and sweet (hoisin). Each of the elements are provided on the side and you add your own condiments. 

There's the whole part with the beef, but then there's the sauce to dip the beef in. I mix a little hoisin with some sate which you have to ask for (it's refrigerated in back). Sate is chiles ground with shallots and shrimp in oil, slightly sweet but earthy and spicy. It is my favorite way to incorporate the spicy aspect into my bowl of pho. I add citrus as I go, to change the flavor a bit, starting with no citrus at all. I always request Ngo Gai (picture included) which is like a kicked up more floral cilantro. It's incredible, although not typically used in pho tai. Thai basil is a must with it's refreshingly licorice-y flavor, bean sprouts add crunch. There's even textural variation throughout your bowl that you can adjust!

I can't say I've ever had the self discipline to order anything other than the pho here.. I give into temptation every time. I'm a big fan of Vietnamese style beef stew and Bun Bo Hue, but I just can't not order the pho! One of these days.. I can, however, vouch for the spring rolls which are good and come with lots of mint. The bahn xeo is tasty and more than an entree size, even though it's on the appetizer list.

A unique offering at Pho Saigon 8 is the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk. I haven't seen this anywhere else in Vegas, and it's like a custard soda. Just the richness I want after a light bowl of pho. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"We've done almost all the Pho places in town. This is not our first choice.

We went in on a Sunday night. It wasn't croweded, based on the speed of service, you would have thought it was the busiest time of the night. Very, very, slow.

Spring Roll is actually quite good. A thick penut sauce was very nice. That's about it. My Korean wife was not pleased with her Pho. We saved the meat for our dogs. 

They were even slow in getting us a check, and taking care of payment. It's if they really didn't want our business.

BTW, my three dogs gave the meat two stars. That's why I gave it that rating."}
{"text":"This place has been opened for a year now and the food is fresh and delicious. The service is very friendly and efficient. They deliver customer service the right way especially in Las Vegas.
We ordered late at 11 pm both the Pho beef/flank/brisket and #42 dry Combo noodles with the broth on the side. Excellent broth and delicious noodle bowls. Thank you for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"So we went to take my sister for Pho for her birthday, and yes this was a highly recommended. We arrived and were told it would be a 10 minute wait for our party of six. About 25-30 minutes we watch them seat a party of 5 that came in after us. We spoke up before they were seated and the staff did not make it right, so we walked out with a very loud voiced opinion. We will NEVER I mean NEVER return and the business owners that recommended this place will be told. I'd also give less than a star if possible."}
{"text":"When my parents first moved to Las Vegas, they asked the cashier at our pizza place (shout out to Eighth Avenue Pizza in Southern Highlands) where he goes for pho. He was Vietnamese and they assumed he would know where to go. He recommended this joint and that was 5 years ago. This has become one of our favorite places to eat out. Get past the language barrier. The menu (as I have photographed) has plenty of pictures with good descriptions of the food. We pretty much get the same thing everytime: 2 orders of spring rolls (they come 2/order); large pho #18, which has everything- rare eye of round, flank, brisket, tendon, & tripe; and #78, crispy egg noodles with stir-fried chicken, seafood. quail eggs, and vegetables. Sometimes, I order #61, grilled slice beef with rice vermicelli. The food comes out quick and is delicious. The wait staff is hit or miss, which is why I docked them a star. The prices are reasonable- pretty much everything is less than $10. The portions are large. We always end up bringing home our lunch and have it for dinner, too. For $1.85, you can order an extra portion of soup broth to add to the leftover pho. We always enjoy our lunch here. We go early, around 11, because they do get busy closer to noon."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Vietnamese food Every time I'm in Vegas for the last 10+ years.  I have tried several other restaurants and find Saigon 8 consistent with their quality of pho. I usually order the house special (pho dac biet) with a side of rare beef, green onions in oil, pickled red onions, and a Vietnamese coffee to boot. It's usually my first stop into town before I check in and my recovery food after a marathon of clubbing.  If I still have room left over I order the three color dessert. 
By the way, I'm Vietnamese and can get particular when it comes to my native food.  It's a good sign when you walk into a Vietnamese restaurant and see a good portion of the clientele Vietnamese.  When I want to eat Vietnamese food in Orange County I got to Bolsa/Westminster and nowhere else and when I'm in LV I go to Saigon 8 off of Spring Mountain.  Why settle!"}
{"text":"Really great lemonade, make sure to stir it. Amazing egg rolls. Wonderful pho tai. Friendly service at the counter and table. Eye contact and smiles. Good prices. It was just really solid."}
{"text":"Worst pho on spring mountain rd!!!! No sprouts, only two piece of tai in large bowl. Dry old spring rolls. Horrible customer service.  Had to chase down server. Hen yum was basically an uncut onion, not even sliced!!  On the plus side, at least the water didn't taste like it came straight from the tap"}
{"text":"Really good Pho! The Spring  Rolls were really good as a starter and you get plenty of food for the price. Nothing fancy but just good Pho."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom. I got the pho with veggies and tofu, my mom got pho with flank.  It was pretty good! I am personally not a big meat eater so I'm happy they had the veggie choice. It was delicious. We also got spring rolls which were pretty good. 
It was pretty empty when we went around 5 pm so service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood pho for pick up! The gentleman was very nice and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is my bf's favorite pho place. So by osmosis, I guess its mine, too. He says they have the best broth. I ... can't tell. It all tastes great to me. All pho is good. I don't know. 

Everything else is typical Viet joint. Tacky decor, unsanitary-looking bathrooms, curt but quick service, portions are huge (big bowls of pho for ~$8). The menu is concise, standard Viet. They actually have stuff, too. We've been to other joints and ordered menu items that are no longer available. They haven't been available. They will never be available. What, you can't change the menu or something? 

One time, on a whim, we just tried the pennyworth drink. Had no idea what it was. It tasted like grass. Mental note: just stick with the coconut. 

As much as I mediocre-like this place, pho is always a great solution to a hangover. Cheers. 

* off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"Very relaxing area. Nice place to eat and service is fast. Music is also very relaxing which is they always have the station at 91.5 smooth jazz."}
{"text":"My favorite pho in Vegas. This establishment has been here for years and has been recently renovated. The spring rolls are the best here, fresh and plump. The price has went up but still Good portions for the price. Staff is and service are usually very prompt. Friendliness by the staff is a hit and miss here but I'm here mostly for the food. 10 mins off the strip, past the main Chinatown strip. Rarely is there a wait here even during peak hours when the restaurant is full. I highly recommend this Pho."}
{"text":"This is my usual go to pho place close to home. The restaurant is clean, they get you seated quickly and the portions are fair. Make sure you take note that the pho prices on their menu are for the \"large\" bowl but by default they give you the regular size if you don't ask. 

They have the best taste and value fresh spring rolls (they have pork and shrimp inside) I've had so far in Vegas. Seems so simple but yet other places can't seem to pull it off.

This place is pretty much a get in, eat, get out and get on with your life type of business. The service interaction is fairly minimal (which I actually like in some situations) so don't expect any small talk. They bring you some water, take your order, bring your food and you pay yourself at the counter when you're ready. If you need something else just flag them down and they'll help you. It helps if you know your table number which is labeled but they generally know which table is yours.

Your best bet is to do your homework on what dishes you may want to try, then go in and order by number.

If you're into really thick and strong coffee, give the Vietnamese ice coffee a try. I'll try to post a video of it brewing - it takes quite some time to funnel its way down into the glass so you can dump it in your ice but it's worth the wait.

My biggest beef with Pho Saigon 8 is that their Spring Mountain location is subpar and inconsistent in food taste/quality.  I will however visit this location any day of the week.

PS- if you like pork chops marinated in fish sauce and grilled.. It's absolutely wonderful here. Another popular item is any of the bún - rice noodle (no soup) dishes. Be sure to try it with the sweet chili sauce!"}
{"text":"I'm from the bay area and have tried beef stew noodle soup all over the area and since moving to Vegas, I needed my pho phix!  Thanks yelpers, for helping me find this place!  They make one of the best that I have tasted.  The broth is delicious and the beef meat to tendon ratio is great.  I will be back to try other dishes as well."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas and need a Pho Fix? 
Tired of paying through the nose for flashy Casino Faux Asian food without authentic, down-home goodness? 

If you have a rental, venture up the strip and turn west on Spring Mountain (Circus Circus and Sahara, near Fashion Show Mall). Go about 2 blocks, and between Wynn Road and Decatur, you will find the asian shopping and restaurant district of LV. Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, you name it.!

Pho Saigon 8 is in this area. A large place seating up to 100 (25 tables of four). It must be run by the second generation, because it is clean, has quality decorative modern furniture, high ceilings, clean floors, computer POS terminals, and tasteful 18x24 art pieces of young Vietnamese women. Popular love songs, but no big screen DVD variety shows!

Their name implies they only serve Pho, but they serve a large array of typical Vietnamese dishes. Yes, Pho Bo (beef) and Pho Ga (chicken) ranging from $4.50 to $7.00; but also Hu Tieu and Mi (Pork or Seafood Soups with Rice or Egg Noodles $7.50),  Com Dia (Rice Plates $6.95 to $9.00), Bun (Vermicelli noodles including the popular  Bun Bo Hue, from $6.35 to $9.50) and deserts (3 types of Che) and drinks (i.e. Vietnamese coffee, coconut juice, plum soda, etc.)

The Pho was good, albeit the sprouts and basil were a little wilted. This is a pleasant atmosphere with pretty good food and acceptable service. Not sure what the 8 represents in Vietnamese. It might imply that the restaurant is run by Chinese, since 8 in that culture is good luck, and also refers to longevity, as in the popular myths of the 8 immortals."}
{"text":"They do have other food here...
But I keep coming back for the Phò.
It has always been outstanding.

Made to order, fresh, hot and served by friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is good...but the service is just not up to Par.  They need to be a little bit more organized."}
{"text":"This Pho restaurant is ok if you are not able to go to CHina Town.  They are often crowded and the tables are too close together.

The Pho is pretty good and so is the BBQ chicken rice plate.  That sauce to dip the chicken in GOOD!

We go there when we dont want to drive to far."}

I knew I wanted to order the spring rolls but what else? I asked the waiter to bring me the customer favorite... I'm not sure what kind of plant or animal life I ate, but it was tasty!
If I find myself in Vegas again, I'll go back pho sure!!"}
{"text":"NEVER coming back to eat here!!!
Hope the $13.75 is worth my monthly business and a bad review. 

Told her I wanted Phô Xâo Dón Thâp Câm which I've had at different Vietnamese restaurant. She pointed at #79-Phô Áp Châo Thâp Cám. I asked specifically if noodles are flat and cut in squares. She mutters, \"It's same..same thing\". Okay I'll get it. 10minutes later guy comes and drops it off at table and leaves. I waved at guy to tell him it's not the same noodles that I wanted. He said, u ordered #79! Yes but only bc she said it was same thing....And it's not! He then tried to explain that every place makes it different. Okay I understand that so don't tell me it's same thing if it's NOT, right? Well immediately I said, \"can I see the menu I want something else.\"!He continues trying to explain and wasn't taking it off my bill bc \"I ordered it\". I finally said fine do whatever charge me but I don't want it.  I ordered #70. It was okay(5.5/10), definitely had better at other places. 
Now that I've read few other 1star reviews on here, 200% I will NOT ever eat here!!! It was on dirty dining for demerits, Yelper witnessed employees not washing hands, Yelper had hair and bug found in their food! Plus you raised the prices on menu I noticed. 

Here's my $13.75 of advertising for u!!!"}
{"text":"Close to the house, I frequent this restaurant when in need for something not super heavy to eat.  Overall it is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants around my neighborhood.  It actually gets pretty busy at times since it's in the LVAC parking lot.  A fair amount of seating, but we usually get take out.  Check your order though because we have on multiple occasions received the wrong order, and let's just say they were annoyed with us and claimed we got it wrong.

We always get their fresh spring rolls, and they provide a generous amount of peanut hoison dipping sauce in the to go order.  The rolls are also fairly sizable.  Not the best I have ever had, but consistent and hit the spot.

I get the vermicelli noodles with the grilled pork.  However I always get it to eat the next day because they always cook their noodles to long, and they firm up over night.  The pork is flavorful and tender, but the naoc mam (fish sauce) is fairly basic. I wish they used more herbs, garlic, shallots etc to add some extra punch to their noodle bowls.

My boyfriend appreciates that they have the Vietnamese rice porridge (chao) on request, but I prefer his mothers.  This one doesn't have that much of a flavor to me, and I get bored eating it quickly.  He also prefers their pho here above a lot of places in the valley.  They give a large amount of basil and and limes on the side unlike some places.  He always gets the combo.

They have some good jelly desserts that are tasty, a bit sweet, but less sweet than a lot of other restaurants.

They are a good spot when you don't feel like driving further into China town. Although I don't feel I have been to a Vietnamese spot in Las Vegas that has totally blown my mind yet, despite the many selections that have been popping up."}
{"text":"OMG... I was totally shocked by the flavorful broth! This place is great after a whole night of getting intoxicated which is exactly why we wanted Pho instead of all those americanized asian restaurants in Vegas.  

I called my friend Thuy (one foodie to another) and she introduced me to this place...so thanks THUY!"}
{"text":"i love having relatives that live in vegas.... i get to enjoy the culinary treats that are off strip, delicious, and without the unnecessary fluff that comes with the territory of being on-strip.  

pho saigon is no fuss, no muss delicious vietnamese food.  i enjoyed the rolls and a vermicelli bowl with both pork and shrimp, although they were a little stingy with the shrimp portion of the dish.  i was able to also sample my cuzzo's veggie tofu pho which was delicious and chock-full of vegetables.  

it is rather expensive for vietnamese fare, but the portions are large (even when ordering a small).  they have a lot of staff, and things come out quickly and hot!  

a downside, my cuzzo ordered a thai iced tea with tapioca pearls, and the tapiocas were hard as rocks.  they were accommodating though and offered to cook up another batch, but she declined."}
{"text":"The best pho in town !  I used to go to their Springmountain location , so it's the same menu.   Same foods , but with better service.  Eric, the manager, used to work at the other location, is always friendly.   I usually get the #15 , meatballs and rare eye round steak.  The beef stew w/ french bread is delicious too.  My girl recently ordered combo fried rice and now it's her usual outside of ordering pho.  It's got a great flavor with bits of chinese sausage thrown in .
      Their competitor : Lemongrass- pho :  broth is bland ,  very little meat"}
{"text":"Very Tasty. I am so glad, I stopped. The vegetarian pho was perfect. The service was prompt. Even the veggie spring rolls were excellent."}
{"text":"We were all all hung over after a night of drinking and needed something to hydrate us. Soup sounds good. We pulled over to this pho restaurant. I had pho before in Portland and it's always the best cure for hangover. 
The moment we stepped into the place, already we were soaked in the aroma of pho. Definitely smells like it's worth staying. 
Our pho arrived and it smells awesome. The first bite was good but not as great as I thought it would be by the smell. The service was typical. Overall, it was just a good pho place."}
{"text":"I'm so irritated by this place. I was told about it by family and thought I would give it a try. I was sat promptly for just myself. I totally understand at these places especially for a party of one if your at a large table other party's are sat with you. The family that was sat at the same table had a young child with the loudest Ipad ever on. After five minutes and no servers coming by I got up and decided to order to go.

I ordered a chicken pho, egg rolls, a roll of French bread and Thai iced tea. When he told me the total I almost said never mind but I'm really hungry and craving soup. Fine f*** it I'll pay the !!!!!$21 dollar!!!!! bill.
I've never paid so much for literally the same meal I get every time I go to a pho place. That's how much it usually costs for two meals! 

So I sit down to wait....and wait......and wait. It's been 30 minutes from the time I ordered to go. I'm about ready to say never mind I want my money back. Me and another guy get up and are looking at the dude in the front like ughhhhh hello! He goes into the back and brings out 5 to go orders! Are you freaking kidding me?!?! So my order was just sitting back there?! When I ask for my Thai iced tea he grabs it out of the fridge with a bunch of melted ice in it. So that was probably sitting there for 30 minutes also. I got it home and it was just warm not hot like it should be. Egg rolls were soggy. Not crispy crunchy. So disappointed 

Food was just ok. Not any better than any other place. Not terrible. Just whatever. 

Also it was totally silent in there. Like no music. It was awkward no ambiance or vibe. 

NEVER GOING HERE AGIAN. I should have just gone to a place I had been before."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER GO HERE!!!! WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!!! I hate that I'm even wasting time giving them this review. I would give this place negative 5 stars if I could. We walked in and they seated us right away, however the waiter did not give us no menus & no water, the tables stunk so bad life old dirty rags,  we sat there for 20 minutes, nobody even acknowledged we were even there, we walked out..."}
{"text":"I love pho.  Nothing beats a warm bowl of soup and Pho Saigon 8 does it right.  I really enjoy it here.  Only Pho So 1 & Pho Kim Long do it better in Vegas.  I eat pho often and I need variety, so this place is my number 3."}
{"text":"Only pho place I enjoy eating at in Las Vegas- I'm picky with pho (Tip: if the word Pho isn't in the restaurant's name, don't get pho.)

My family and I have been eating here for as long as I can remember. The pho here is great the majority of the time. There are some days when the broth can be too salty, so a star off for its inconsistency. Good sized portions and price. Won't find better pho in the valley.
While most places offer jasmine tea, they give this vanilla tea which I really enjoy.

With it being a Vietnamese restaurant, don't expect exemplary customer service.."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken breast pho, Scrumptious delicious appetizers, no crazy hovering from the servers and an efficient checkout process with the cashier. Who could ask for more?. Plus the broth is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and out of all the times I've never had a bad experience. 

I usually order two things. Com Thit Nuong and Bum Bo Hue. The Com Thit Nuong's beef has a bit of charr to it which makes for the perfect crunch.This dish also comes with the pho soup. So if you're deciding if you want soup or rice you should just get this cause it comes with soup. So you get the best of both worlds. To make the perfect pho soup it cannot be salty. It's literally a large bowl of bone broth. It should be very clear and tasteful. If it makes you thirsty, then there's probably extra salt.

I am a big fan of spicy soup. Especially with pork blood. I know it sounds gross, but don't knock it till you try it. This restaurant by far has the best Bum Bo Hue. What makes them different is they don't have all the oil in it. Most pho places that make this soup adds too much chili oil. So when I drink it alone, I can taste a spoon full of oil. The broth here is spicy and tasteful. They don't add too much meat where it over powers your bowl. The noodles is the perfect amount. Note: they do not make this in a small. If you get the large, you won't regret it. 

Pricing: it is cheap!! 

Parking - the restaurant is located in the same center as the 7-11 and Mcdonalds. There's plenty of parking. At no charge :)"}
{"text":"Everyone would agree that broth in a soup is key, and this place does just that. Service is better than others. Price is on par with competition. One big plus is  that this place is always clean."}
{"text":"Had the beef pho. I forget if it was the number 11 or 12. It was very good. Some places have a cilantro overkill, but this place did it just right."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I think it's a pretty decent place overall. 

I really like their egg rolls and spring rolls. Both are yummy and the portions are decent for the price. The sauce that comes with both is really good. 

I usually get the pho with chicken and that is my favorite option here. Today I had the pho with beef and I didn't like the beef as much as the chicken. The amount of meat in all of the pho options is generous. My husband was on the fence about giving pho a try, but changed his mind when he saw how much meat comes in the bowl. The small bowl is a lot of food and I can't imagine who would be able to eat the large. I like that they bring out items to help customize your dish like bean sprouts, basil, lime, chili paste, and jalapenos. I love adding jalapenos and chili paste for a spicy dish.

The restaurant seems clean. The service isn't anything notable, but it isn't bad either. The food comes out quickly and drinks get refilled before you need to ask. I like the check out process as well. When you are finished you just go to the counter, give them your table number (a sticker on the turntable at each table), and they give you your total."}
{"text":"This is a great little place after the gym or for lunch. It is healthy and good for your diet, but also quick and good for your budget. Plus, pho makes you feel good in general. If you have a short lunch break, this place is great. I think this is the best pho place in town."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and the restaurant is quite clean too. I used to go to the spring mountain location but I moved. So you can imagine I was pretty excited when they opened up this location that was much closer. I would recommend you giving them a try. Their rice vermicelli and rice dishes can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great service and super fast. I ordered beef pho less than 3 minutes later I had my order it was hot and very delicious. I was amazed since it was a full house. I will totally recommend this restaurant to anyone who has a Pho craving. I been to many Pho restaurants but this restaurant was just to fast love it."}
{"text":"Food was good. Unfortunately the servers act like they don't want to be there. And when you ask for a to-go container, you get an eye roll. Not even a thank you or have a good day. Sad because I liked the food."}
{"text":"2nd best pho in Vegas next to Pho Kim Long Fast service and the soup is always on point!"}
{"text":"If you want a really good bowl of pho, I recommend this place. I ordered rare and well cooked beef pho. The spring rolls are really good too. 

I ordered wine haha that was a plus !"}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Saigon 8 multiple times; there are a few pros and cons for me.

Pros:
- Generous portions of Pho for low prices
- Delicious, hearty broth; one of the better broths out of the Pho restaurants I've been to
- Delicious Vietnamese fried egg rolls and rice paper spring rolls
- Fast service 

Cons:
- Brisket is the only meat I ever order in my Pho and the brisket here is way too fatty. Each slice of brisket is over 50% fat. There's different kinds of fatty too but this one is ridiculously chewy. I spend more time dissecting my brisket than enjoying my soup. 
- Sometimes the bean sprouts they bring out for your Pho looks and tastes old and withered

Anyway, the broth is amazing. If you order your pho and get meatballs, flank steak, rare beef, etc. I would definitely recommend coming here. If you like brisket though, try Pho Little Siagon across the street. Such tender beef brisket!"}
{"text":"Ginormous hearty bowls of pho! 

I used to frequent the location on Eastern and came here for the first time the other day. I'm a huge fan for the taste and quality of the pho.

- Open restaurant - plenty of comfy booths and tables for seating 
- Averaging $9 for a regular bowl of pho, $10 for a large bowl of pho 
- Beansprouts are clean, fresh, and trimmed (some pho places they're just brown, stringy, and gross) 
- Broth is flavorful and delish just like the Eastern location 
- You can order LEAN brisket! It's not fatty and the meat is just as soft! 
- Pho is filled with generous portions of meat and vermicelli noodles 
- Service was average - nothing extravagant

This would probably be my #1 recommendation for pho if you're in the Southwest area. I didn't try any of their other dishes or teas - however - for a delicious bowl of pho it's definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"With the winter approaching Pho Saigon is a go to place for my family. We used to go here all the time and loved it. We stopped going for a while because we don't eat beef or pork anymore. Luckily for us they said that any soup can substitute the broth for chicken! The seafood which is our usual is already made in a chicken broth. The spring rolls aren't fried they are just in clear wraps which is different for me I wasn't a fan of them. The employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"Best chain pho restaurant in Vegas. Taste is closest to Home. This Eastern location is smaller and has a limited menu compared to the Spring Mountain location. -1 star because they don't have fresh squeezed orange juice or soy milk, 2 items I always look forward to at Spring Mtn location."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for good, non-overpriced vietnamese food in vegas! I don't know why people go to pho saigon, because there's no line here and I think the food is better! It's just a little farther drive down spring mountain rd. 

I've had the pho, vermicelli, and the rice dishes here and everything is good! You can't fail with whatever you order, so don't worry! I always end up caving into ordering the fillet mignon (bo luc lac) with french rice because I just can't say no to garlic! They make it better than the restaurants in little saigon in california! If you're a garlic lover like myself, you'll love this dish because the beef is drenched in so much garlic, you'll have enough to eat it with the rice too!"}
{"text":"The bf ordered flank steak and only had literally one piece of meat. The rest of the time while eating he had to pull out the cartilage and fatty pieces. I got the chicken pho, chicken was rubbery and felt like it was frozen for a while. Noodles were hard and clumped together, and the spearmint and jalapeños were turning black...bean sprouts were fresh tho and water was good and perfectly iced."}
{"text":"okay, I went to eat at this place several times, and every single time, the smell of fish sauce on the table bothers me much, the service is okay, not friendly, I ordered the vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp, the noodle is so cold that I had to tell them to microwave it again,
they put a lot of MSG into the broth that after finishing eating, you will have to drink plenty plenty of water, too bad"}
{"text":"I have been to this place about 3 times now.  Place is almost always packed.  Food is great and service can improve.  It is good place to go for 1.5hrs lunches.  :) 

Fresh rolls are awesome here and so is the beef stew!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here service is superb, food is great, location is near my home. When they get busy is when space is extremely limited.  Overall rating is 4 stars"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, food and service are excellent.  Recommend this to anyone. The noodle soup I ordered was hot and delicious"}
{"text":"There is an extensive selection of Vietnamese dishes here, including different types of pho for cheap prices.  I was able to stop in here for a fresh, tasty bowl of beef pho with tender rare steak and a Vietnamese ice coffee on my way to the airport.  

As opposed to the bay area, this place is much nicer than the average pho joint where I'm from.  The furniture here is a rich chocolate brown color including the walls where matchstick bamboo roll up shades hang over the windows.  The table tops on dark wooden legs are a sturdy granite with green and brown shades.  Even the chairs are  unique with routered silhouettes of bowls of pho with chopsticks on the wooden seat back of each chair.  There is a nice selection of dark green foliage inside giving the restaurant somewhat of an exotic feel.

The service here is also attentive, friendly and good.  They will clear your table as dishes become empty unlike the average pho spot which waits until you're completely finished."}
{"text":"Great place for pho and spring rolls. Place is always busy and service is quick. Easy atmosphere and a decent Thai Ice tea. I seem to hit this place up at least once a week. Its also easy on the pocket too."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times out of all the times we've come to Vegas. This one was the worst visit. We had a table of 10 people. 9 peoples orders came and one of those 9 even ordered an additional plate of food. We finished all of our food and within the time we were all eating, we asked if the last order was coming three times and they said it's coming. It never came and we were already almost done with the food. The server came and checked if we already got the order and ate it instead of checking if the kitchen fulfilled that order already. We were already done eating so she just ate our appetizers instead of an actual entree. 

The bo luc lac, which is shaken beef was cooked medium rare and it was extremely chewy. The onions were raw and the rice that came with it was overlooked and hard, almost as if it was a few days old. 

It's been two times where they fill the water on one half of the table and not the other half.

Service = 1star 
Food = 3star"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is so popular.  My friend's friend insisted on going here before heading home from Vegas.  I got the bun with pork and eggrolls (standard).  Eggrolls were no good - soggy and lacked flavor.  It came with only a little pork as well.  My friend got spring rolls - those weren't very good either.  Some got the pho, which I did think tasted flavorful and good.  The small size was too small for my firend, though, which is why she ordered the spring rolls.  Peanut sauce was not that great either.  And another got this red, spicy looking beef udon soup.  I didn't try it, but she loved it.  By the time we left, there was a line of people waiting.  Oh, they serve Vietnamese coffee in those little metal strainers, which then drips into a cup of a ton of Condensed Milk.  They gave us cups with ice.  OMG - the coffee was so good.  It wasn't the usual Cafe du Monde, which has a distinct chicory taste, but way better.  Both my friend and I raved about the coffee.  Service is pretty bad, too."}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue was hella good. Come here twice a week. Gave them 4 stars for good food. They lost one star due to horrible services. Service was so unprofessional and rude that I almost ask them if they want my business or not. If I didn't crave for the Bun Bo Hue soo much, I could just tell the servers to fuck off."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I always get the #12 large size and it's always fresh and delicious.  Really good broth, and the meat is sliced super thin and they give you a lot!  The noodles are on point too.  My order is always to my table in like 5 mins, and my water glass is never empty, just make it visible on your table cuz they can get really busy.  If you want a nice hot filling meal, come here.  I live close, so it's my go-to pho spot."}
{"text":"First time here, it was a busy place and the staff here are ok, not all friendly and willing to help though.

We were a party of 6 so we had to wait a few minutes to be seated no big deal.  Once seated it took a bit for a server to come over and take our drink orders, he was working hard and doing a good job.  

Once the food came we were on our own.  The food was ok, nothing special that would make anyone in our party run back to this place especially since they have several locations.

Like I said after the food came you were on your own.  If you needed more drink or anything else you had to try hard to get someone's attention and if it's not the right person, hence a guy clearing tables, he has NO problem letting you know he does not do that and he will be gracious enough to NOT let anyone else know your table is in need of something.  So you are left to try and catch the attention of a friendly person who will either get you what you need or let your server know.  

It is a busy place, most are friendly and try to help, the food is ok but overall and I guess it's hard when you are as busy as they were, keeping the place clean is a challenge."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family and ordere the fried tofu appetizer, seafood fried rice, grilled porky vermicelli, and of course pho. 

The food was good and the portions were a perfect size. We ended up taking food home!"}
{"text":"I've always come here with my family of 8 people and had great and fast service. Today I was so disappointed with the service. The server sit us and left. He then sit another table with 3 ppl after us. He took their orders and brought out drinks for them. I looked at him and he said since we had a big group so he going to come to us after. Wth does that have to do with first come first served! Then he just walked back and forth like he had nothing to do. I got so irritated and got up and left! 


Tonight I brought my family back because we do love this place. Peter, the manager was very nice and professional. He recognized me and came to apologized for the incident. I wasn't expecting for anything but he comp us some drinks. We will be back. Thank you Peter for the pleasant experience tonight."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town!  Took a friend visiting  from out of town and she loved it. She hated the places that I room her to in Colorado.  The broth here is hands down awesome.  Service is hit or miss but that's not why you go! Rare steak is my fav here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great service and they are very efficient. The food is amazing and very well priced. I have tried multiple locations of pho Saigon this one is my favorite our of all of them!"}
{"text":"I appreciate good pho, but I rarely stray from the \"safe stuff\".  This place is pretty go-to when I'm looking for some hot soup and some fresh spring rolls.  I haven't tried any of the non-pho stuff, to be honest.

This place seems like it is always busy, but there are always tables opening up.  The staff works pretty quickly to get things cleaned up and usher in new customers."}
{"text":"Good and fast.  Pho was hot and well spiced.  Lean meat, no fat.  Grilled beef was very good.  
Had kids with us.  Nice fast dinner."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had!  I've eaten here weekly for a few years.  Large 22 cures any ailment!  Always great fresh sides for the soup.  Best iced tea in town.  It's got Jasmine and a ton of other flavors I love, but can't name.  Their fresh French bread is to die for along with their always crispy, piping hot egg rolls."}
{"text":"Found this authentic Vietnamese eatery in the Chinatown area of Las Vegas.  Great find and recommended. They have a big selection of pho at inexpensive prices.  I got a small pho for about $8.50 and it was a huge bowl full of beef, noodles and broth.  Very tasty! The meal came with a huge side of fresh, crunchy bean sprouts and basil and a homemade Vietnamese hot tea. This tea was the best tasting tea I've ever had... Wish they sold it but one of the staff told me it was home made and didn't come in dry form. Many Asians dining there so that's always a good sign.  Next time you're in Vegas check this place out which is a short distance away from the touristy Strip."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from Hawaii and needed to find a pho place. This place is great! They give big portions that are sure to fill you up with reasonable prices! Customer service is normally on point as I can only recall on time of mediocre service. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love the Pho at this place.  I typically get the shrimp and crab in pork broth.  I love the location since it is right by my house, and the prices cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Fast review for a fast restaurant!

 REALLY FAST FOOD! But good quality.

Veggie Pho has really good cooked veggies including Bok Choy. They are always friendly and have good service. Price is great and I know when I in a hurry I can still eat well. Please check them out!"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 was one of those random huge restaurants at the side of the road on Spring Mountain. In Chinatown, there are many Pho choices but...Pho Saigon 8 has the biggest signage. Hah. So, me and my sis got here on suggestion via Yelp. 

When I walked in, at first I thought it was like a cafeteria style. We sat, ordered, ate, waited for the check....like natural noobs. We seriously conversed and observed for a good 30 minutes to see if others were given checks. We then realized people were walking up to cashier and saying their table number. Needless to say, we felt stupid...cashier laughed it up also.

On to the food, we ordered spring rolls, meatball pho, and veggie pho. The spring rolls were excellent, fresh veggies served alongside these little deep fried packets of awesome. Always wrap them in lettuce dipped in sarachi, epic. The pho was extremely flavorful!!! The broth was savory and just a little hint of mint at the end of the taste which is exactly how I like it.

Service was extremely fast, streamlined by the ordering process which is a plus and a minus. A plus for speed but a minus for personalized service: seriously, my only gripe, otherwise Pho Saigon 8 is a lock!!! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to get your pho fix.

Environment: similar to most Vietnamese restaurant, most people come here for a quick lunch or dinner. 

Service: most of the workers are Vietnamese. I wouldn't say they are super friendly, but they get the job done. We sat down quickly, they got our orders fast and brought our food out quickly. You then pay at the front cashier before you leave.

Food: the food here is pretty good. I got the spring rolls which taste good especially with their peanut sauce. I get the pho special with the tendons tripe and flank beef. Because I was really craving pho, i really enjoyed it. The broth was delicious and the meat was good as well. They also give you the standard sprouts, mint leaves, lime, and jalapeños. 

Overall, good spot to get your pho fix. It is in a convenient location, and you can eat quickly and get back to your business after."}
{"text":"Pho was okay, Spring rolls were okay, Service.. what service? We had to get our own refills on water, our check and did I mention they forgot our food? We sat there for twenty minutes waiting for one bowl of pho and spring rolls. Finally we went up to ask and there was our waitress busy eating and on the phone. I understand you need to eat but you're still working so either you find someone else to help us or do your job & put our order in, refill our water, and bring us our check."}
{"text":"The service as quick but waiters were all over the place. When you need something better ask quick and fast because these waiters are on the move! Other than that the food is great."}
{"text":"Really REALLY good.
Ordered the Pork flavored pho and it was delish. The broth was one of the best broths i've had. Service was super quick and to top of the great meal the soundtrack they had playing was some super old school pop and it was awesome. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best Pho!   Love this place noodles are delicious-broth is flavorful!  my favorite #11!   The basil, bean sprouts, jalapeño and lime wedges along with the oysters sauce and Sriracha sauce makes the meal to my unique taste spicy and yummy!   We have introduced Pho Saigon 8 to family and friends and will keep on coming back.  Restaurant is clean and staff is prompt."}
{"text":"Pho! Pho! Pho! 

This place is AMAZEBALLS. I absolutely adore the soup. The noodles are just right, and the location is close to a bunch of shops that are interesting to check out before of after you stop on. Relatively cheap Eats without the cheap after effects. I love how clean the restaurant is and how efficient the waiters are. Never had a complaint or had to turn back food. I frequent this place whenever I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Poor service in this resto. Wait staff looks like they don't want your business and cashier is texting. Food is decent just needs better service"}
{"text":"Pho was good (broth was lighter per previous reviewer's comments).  Prices were reasonable.  Restaurant was very clean and service was a-ok.  I have nothing bad to say about it.  

Also, @Matthew C: though I've been known to have a similar opinion about LV residents' tastes, I thinks it's super positive to see restaurants opening that are not KFCs / Taco Bells.  I like to support any independent business trying to make it."}
{"text":"I've tried about 95% of all the Vietnamese restaurants in town so just wanted to note some distinguishing factors.

The egg-rolls are not as good as pho so 1.  They are smaller, less flavorful and not as fresh.

The pho broth and noodles taste as if they use less MSG than most other places which is a good thing.  The meat portion in their dac biet is about average.

They do offer the same wide variety as many other vietnamese places, one thing i do advise people not to order is there bun cahn sai gon #42.  Horrible dish, gelly like soup, and during the time i ordered it, the noodles were hard and not prepared properly at all."}
{"text":"San Francisco Bay Area transplant and it's some of the best I've ever had. 

Best Pho"}
{"text":"We are here every week because we absolutely love this place. Affordable price, big serving, good tasting food."}
{"text":"Always a great place for some pho.  Service is fast and polite and the food is not greasy.  The eggs rolls and spring rolls are fresh and the rice dishes are always so delicious! The price is reasonable and definitely worth it. I've been to a lot of pho places and this makes it to the top!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a Pho kinda guy.  But a friend loves the place so we went.  I had the pork chops, which aside from them being really thin were actually pretty tasty."}
{"text":"A great pho place that may leave you with Chinese Fast Food Syndrome, full when you're done, but hungry 30 minutes later.

I came during a very busy time for lunch, and saw a lot of Asian families here. This is a good sign. Like most Asian restaurant, there is very little to no service. Sit, order, eat, pay, out. 

The pho is good here. The broth is good, but the noodle is lacking like all the other places in town. In terms of portion, this place doesn't serve as big of a portion than Pho 87. Pho Saigon 8 is a little more expensive than other places if you do a comparison of price to portions. However, it is tasty for what you get.

The other issue with this place was I felt full after eating the bowl of Pho, but 5 minutes later I was hungry. I do have a big appetite, but I just got the case of Chinese Fast Food Syndrome, which all points to MSG. For me personally, I could care less about MSG. I could even eat MSG ice cream wrapped in bacon. But, for those concern about MSG, I'm fairly certain this place uses MSG.

This is a decent pho place. Very tasty stuff. Is it the best pho place in Vegas? Nope. But it should be satisfactory for most people."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it just opened but my chicken was like super over cooked to the point that some part I couldn't even eat. I got the red rice with the whole hen. And I couldn't eat the flap part or some of the outside part of the whole chicken cause it's overcooked to the point that it's hard. And then my rice .. I usually love the red rice but it was so stale & just not easy to eat.
The pho soup on the other hand is pretty descent. Overall, I would like to come back maybe when they're not training anymore or something cause I couldn't even finish my food :("}
{"text":"We have dined at this location several times when it was originally occupied by Bon Jour Bistro and most recently by the American Grill.  We shared orders of Pho ga tang (chicken noodle soup served with cilantro, basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and hoisin sauce) and cha gio (crisp spring rolls that you wrap in a piece of lettuce and dip in nuoc cham (Vietnamese dipping sauce)).  The basil was not fresh so I requested more and got what I asked for, more un-fresh basil.  The flavor of the pho was mild and the chicken was limited to a few shreds."}
{"text":"Good food, but awful service and the prices are higher than similar places. We were ignored by the staff consistently and even after literally waiving at several people who made eye contact still no acknowledgment. 
The staff members, while inattentive, were also dressed in clothes that looked unwashed."}
{"text":"Services is pissed poor. My friend already got his order, but I never got mine. Couldn't get anyone to take my order, every server kept passed by the table, just no one would stop to take my order. Will never go back to such pissed poor services restaurant."}
{"text":"Passing by this place to give it another try.. Not holding my hope up.. 

First thing walking into the restaurant, what's up with flickering lights? Are we in October hollowing hunted house already?
Don't like hunted restaurant!!

Services still poor, there are NO soup spoons on the table we were sitting at! I asked for it, of course, non came. I had to seek spoons from adjacent table! 

Then as we wait for waiter to get our orders, he expressed they had RUN out of basil for pho noodle soup!!! It is unheard of! Sounds like breakfast restaurant telling me they run of eggs and bacons at 06:00 AM as I just sit down in their restaurant.

Then we were out of cold water, I asked for more water. It only took 10 minutes for the water made it to our table after 8 other tables got their fresh water refilled!?!? WTF!?!?

Hunted restaurant!? No soup spoons, no waters, no basil for pho noodle soup!! Sorry, Pho Sai Gon 8 at Henderson, you fail again as customer services!"}

I've only ordered takeout but both times were really good. I've tried different things on the menu like the vermicelli, bun bo hue, beef ball soup, & some rice dishes. All were very good. 

The only reason this place lost a star is because once when I went, there was a bunch of homeless people hanging out on the side corner. Didn't look too good. But it was the 1st time I went & since then there hasn't been anymore.

{"text":"Saigon 8 is by far the best pho place ever!!  My boyfriend and  I have been regulars there for about 3 years now.   I always take my friends or family that visit to saigon 8 and everyone always loves it.  They have the best pho Ive ever had and it is consistently excellent.   I usually get the fried spring rolls, fresh or tofu spring rolls and the white meat chicken soup.  Sometimes i branch out and order the beef pho, wonton pho with egg noodles or beef stew noodle soup.  I also occasionally order the korean bbq rice plate or another variation of rice platter.  I also like to end the meal with an iced vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. yum!  I must say Saigon 8 is one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Its inexpensive and consistently delicious."}
{"text":"My go to pho spot. Broth is flavorful and consistent. My favorites are the pho with well done lean meat and the bbq pork rice dish.  I used to dine here pretty often but lately I've been getting takeout. The soup is packaged very nicely and just as tasty as when we dine in."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 2 years. It is a great little spot for a great bowl of pho. The food is really good and the staff is great as well. In addition, when I order to-go, the food is ready at a good rate, without flavor or quality compromise. Awesome food and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Introduction:
I tried to come here at least once a week. The food is outstanding and so is the service.

Quality: 5/5
I usually have the #22 large bowl Pho. I seemed to never finish it, but it's so good that the small is not enough.

Customer Service: 5/5
Definitely awesome, the waiter and Waitresses are cordial and on point.  Usually, you don't get these type of services at a Pho restaurant.

Quantity: 5/5
My gosh, they are super generous with their meat portions. No matter what you order, it's guaranteed that you will have enough food to fulfill your belly.

Cleanliness: 5/5
Squeaky clean.  Again, another unusual experience you will have at a Pho restaurant. In a good way of course.

Atmosphere: 5/5
No matter how busy they are, everyone appeared to be organized and not running like a chicken with it's head cut off.

Tips: 
If you are like me, not a fan of the Ketchup fried rice, you can actually order regular fried rice. Which is super delicious."}
{"text":"we came here after a night of drinking. LOTS of drinking. in fact I think we were still drunk when we stumbled into the restaurant. I love pho, especially post-drunken debauchery. So I said forget the buffet, lets get some pho! Thank you yelp for sending us to this spot.

The night before we tried taking a cab to get pho, the place ended up being closed and we had to pay $20 for a freakin cab ride... ugh! so we were REALLY looking forward to this. and it did not let us down. The place was packed with asians, from what I could tell they were mostly vietnamese or filipino. 

I ordered the pho tai bo vien. The bowl came steaming hot with so much greenery on top it looked like a garden, lol jk. but that's good cus you know it'll be flavorful! The soup was really good and it came with lots of meat. My friend ordered pho tai with no noodles and the order came out right for once! 

we all enjoyed the pho. it was so good we wanted to order some to go for after the nights festivities! lol!  next time we'll try the rice dishes too! If youre tired/too broke for buffets and theres no deals for steak & eggs nearby, go get some pho at pho saigon 8!! :]"}
{"text":"The Pho Tai was ok. The beef was chewy and the broth was ok. Maybe it was at the end of the evening and they've diluted the broth to make it stretch. The service was kind of slow but the server was nice and polite. The table was sticky and the utensils were dirty so we had to ask for new ones that didn't have dry old food stuck on the chopsticks and soup spoon. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I feel like there must be an alternative pho universe here when I hear people talking about how this restaurant is so awesome and gives too much beef. I guess they've shrunk them down so much that we are made to believe we are getting more even though it's actually less. We usually go to Pho 8 or Pho So #1. All the Pho start at a large for $8.55. You can ask for smaller but it defaults at large. Business tactic I presume. Any other place you are given a small at a lower price and not the other way around. I always order #13, beef and flank. The noodles came out bunched up, as if they took it out from the bin and stuck it into the broth soup without giving it a light cooking. The last 2 times I came, I thought the broth was too cold because it couldn't fully cook my meat. This time it was hot. It's getting a bit inconsistent. I got a little turned off by some cream in my bean sprouts and spearmint leaves. They were polite and grumbled it must've come from the jalapeño. Really? I quickly ran to the restroom to check my forehead. Afraid my better half wrote stupid on it that morning when I woke up late. But they brought me another. It's just not normal to have cream in a Pho restaurant. But at least they gave me a new one. Whipped cream isn't a big deal but I was afraid it might be silicone or something. Asian restaurants aren't the cleanest in the world I hate to say.

As for the beef, you get the same if you order small or large. They just give you more noodles pretty much. I thought it could use a few more pieces given the large bowl of noodles. Normally I get beef on the side but it's pointless if the broth is not boiling hot so I stopped asking for it on the side.

There's really no favorite Pho place for me anymore. #1 has gone down ever since I heard they opened a second location and moved the cooks there. Now the soup tastes more fatty and oily. The broth here is not fatty or oily."}
{"text":"The Pho is excellent here. Being a Vietnamese and a fan of Pho, I am very critical about this dish. Pho here absolutely meets an exceeds my expectation. My sons is 9, and he also loves the dish and finished a whole bowl by himself.
The restaurant is very clean. The service is very quick and friendly. 

I am sure every time we go to Las Vegas, this is the place we will be coming for Vietnamese foods."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I mistakenly ordered Pho from this location through a food delivery service and we noticed the difference in quality. We did not enjoy our dinner and the whole time he commented on how the broth didn't taste good and I had to agree. I tried to find positives but there went any. 

I'll stick to my local Pho restaurant that we frequent because we didn't like the food from this place."}
{"text":"I have been here few weeks and it's hit or miss.  Today, I was there for lunch and I ordered same pho each time I go there.  I can order small pho with extra noodles without extra charge which I learn it from one of the waitress who works there.  Unfortunately she wasn't working there today.  The waiter who took my order today saying he can't put extra noodles.  You have to order on the side for extra $2.00.  He didn't say it with smile either.  The food taste okay, but the service is not so good."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food. I've been to pretty much every pho restaurant in the neighborhood and these guys are the best bar none. The pho broth is deep and flavorful, and every other item I've had has been top notch. Do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Dependable and consistent. I love pho and eat it in every season so I'm glad I have a place that I can count on."}
{"text":"On a hot las vegas day. I was craving bbq chicken and spring roll vermicelli with a tall glass of Thai Iced tea! I wanted to try another Vietnamese place. so I yelped it. And this was one of the popular one. I was in heaven!!!! OMG!! So refreshing. The bean sprouts, carrots, and peanuts  added crunch. The mint was soo refreshing!! I was sooo content. I must stop by if yr in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had in the valley. Every location is fantastic and the food is always consistent. Friendly service as well, will be back again and again."}
{"text":"In the last 2+  years, I never missed coming here every time I came to Vegas, sometimes more than once during a trip.  And let me tell you, I call Vegas my home away from home.  But the last time I was here, it was a big disappointment.  

We got here 15 minutes before closing.  Surprisingly we were not the last customers.  There were several people came in after us as late as 1 minute before closing.  However at the strike of 10:00pm, they promptly turn off the neon 'OPEN' sign.  

I don't know if the timing had anything to do with my experience, but the broth of the PHO was so spicy and off that neither I nor my fiance was able to finish 1/2 of it.  I was just grossed out by it that I couldn't eat another bowl of PHO for a good 2 months anywhere!!!!  

I blame Pho Saigon 8 for ruining my love for PHO because unlike before when I'd crave PHO every week, I hardly eat PHO anymore.  Giving it 3 stars is being kind.  I felt like my BFF had really let me down!"}
{"text":"We love this place for both dine in and to go it is a little small but both my kids love their broth. You can truly tell a great pho house by the smell as you walk in."}
{"text":"I really like the quality of the food here. For starters, the egg rolls are delicious here. I remember my first time they would give s free egg roll, I guess they don't do that anymore, nonetheless still delicious. I haven't tried the spring rolls at THIS location but I have at the other location so I know I won't be disappointed. 

The pho, the broth, the noodles are all just a perfect blend when you need to fill yourself with something delicious with that homemade feel. I usually get the meat on the side, so I can watch the steamy broth cook the thin slices of beef. I LOVE this soup! Seriously, I absolutely love the feeling of warm, spoonfuls of noodles, meat and broth. 

Another one to try, the beef stew. It is served with a warm baguette. That is definitely a nice filler upper! 

If you're not a soup or noodle guy, they also serve rice plates. The thit muons is by far one of the best Vietnamese plates  in the city. 

The only downside is the wait can get hectic. I docked some stars because on the 3 occasions I have been, I've had a weird welcome (no greeting, no one to guide me to a table, so I sat myself only to be reseated?!) and a few inattentive servers. Other than that, the food is good, close to home & very well presented."}
{"text":"One of our friends was debating on what to get and the waiter was super pushy.  Our water glasses sat empty for more than 20 minutes and were never refilled despite the fact this 'female-dog' passed by our table several times.  She only came back to tell us that we needed to pay up at the register.  5 minutes later she comes by to give us our check. We weren't even done eating.
To make matters worse, I ordered the chicken pho thinking that it would be perfect for a hangover.  As I stirred the noodles around, a dead spider came floating to the top.  How authentic!  I nearly threw up.  Being that I wasn't gonna get any more fluids than from this bowl of spider pho, I fished the little guy out and took a few sips.  I would later pay for this mistake 1 hour later by spewing chunks not from my mouth, but from the other end. 

Moral of the story: If you want terrible service, complimentary bugs to go with your meal, diarrhea and worsening of your hangover, come here."}
{"text":"im giving it a 4 because the bun bo hue is fucking great. thats the only reason why i go there. i bring my own bottled water cuz I know im not getting refilled. uhm. customer serive throw that shit out the door. and I'm not vietnamese but for all the yuppies out there thinking your gonna get great service from a vietnamese restaurant, you might want to think again. the pho. not very good at all. but what ever. i give it a 4 because i get what i want and its inexpensive."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had the same grumpy old Asian man server both times. 
I knew I was in the right place when I was the only white guy in there. It is always busy so that says something.

The food is really delicious and such big portions. You are definitely full when you leave.

I decided to take the wife and kids to broaden their horizons. It was an experience watching them look at all the condiments like the basil, lime, jalapenos and sprouts and wondering how they were going to use them.

I had the chicken and seafood pho, it was just as delicious as the first time I had it, with perfectly cooked shrimp and quail eggs floating around for a great rich touch. The broth is so flavorful.

The kids all had the chicken pho. They weren't sure how to eat it. I told them slurping was OK, just in here though..lol

My wife unfortunately didn't eat anything because the old man either didn't understand her when she said vegetarian and asked if they had rice noodles. He kept showing her items on the menu with chicken and just didn't get it.  So that sucked

It was a great experience for the children and I stopped someplace after for the wife.

Service is basic is all I can say. He takes the order, and drops the check off when you are done.

Next time, I want to find a place that clearly says what vegetarian options they have so my wife can enjoy with us..."}
{"text":"Service took awhile on a slow day and because of the repetitive \"having to wait for different items I asked for\", by the end of my meal I forgot to take the food I intended on bringing home lol."}
{"text":"#18 Pho
- Rare steak on the side is only available in size Large.
- Broth was rather salty
- Decent portions
- slightly expensive at ~$7.80 for a Large.

Prompt service, typical of Vietnamese restaurants. 

Cash only!

...odd wire-transfer et al. booth at the front of the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Large #20 (Beef, tendon, flank, and more...) $7.50

Maybe it was because I was hungry, but this is bowl of Pho was one of the best bowls I've ever had. I especially loved the green onions in the soup and the steak like piece of beef tendon. I've never had tendon so thick and delicious before!"}
{"text":"The perfect stop in LV to recover from the buffets on the strip. We always get one large bowl each, one with raw meat, briskest and meat balls that you can dip in hoisin sauce and one bowl with everything including the tendons. My husband is a white guy but in terms of Pho (minus the tendons) he's becoming a native and this is a compulsory stop in Vegas. The service is really fast, so that you can quickly dig in. On the plus side, look around you, plenty of Vietnamese people and this is always a good sign."}
{"text":"It's a nice little spot that I've taken a few friends to. 
Cant go wrong with a clean environment and fresh food ;)"}
{"text":"Four stars because of the service....its a good thing i don't care about that..but only because it's expected from an Asian establishment...Other than that it's good Pho.  I alternate between three different soups depending on my mood..always good..Ive never not enjoyed my meal. The broth is good..not the best Ive had, but its good for when my personal favorite Lemongrass across the street is closed for remodeling. Booo. You won't be disappointed here. Its a good choice."}
{"text":"Will not be back. Absolutely horrible, rude service. I would've given 0 stars if it was an option. It's dumb they won't let you order a small portion for carry out too."}
{"text":"Service:. Fast and efficient.  

Food: decent.  Broth was good.  Way way too many noodles for my liking, but perhaps some like alot of noodles.  Next time, I'll request for not too much noodles, as it is suppose to be a soup, right?
Iced coffee is strong and on point.  :)

I wish they had chili flakes.  I like spicy food but I'm not into the siracha or chili paste as it is just way too much sodium but dry chili powder would compliment pho perfectly.  Hard to find spots with it. Maybe I should travel with my own stash. :p

Will try again."}
{"text":"Tried the vermicelli (bun) here and it was terrible. The rice noodles were overcooked and mushy which pretty much ruined the whole dish, but the beef was also burnt and tasted like nothing but charcoal.

The herbs were fresh and the fish sauce was good, but those are pretty hard things to screw up.

Spring rolls were ok, not bad but not great either.

I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Guys, i just left the place. I ready don't want to say it but I have to warn people that this place are by far the worst place of all the Pho in United State. I feel so bad for not giving tips. But #@## , I spent $ 48.00 and the food was nasty. Well, except the water lol."}
{"text":"I was directed to Saigon 8 years ago by a friend of mine and have been going here every since! I recently discovered they are opening a location on 215 and south Rainbow next week so I am happy to say I will be a loyal customer at that spot as well! Best pho in town!!"}
{"text":"By far the best place to get pho in Las Vegas. I have a 4 year old that at least once a week insist we go to eat here. I must say no matter if it is take out or eat in my wife and I have no problem with the request. We are very pleased there is now a location on are side of town as well."}
{"text":"PS8 for the past one year has the most consistent and best tasting Pho in Las Vegas. When I first moved the Vegas 8 years ago, I picked Pho So 1 as the best place to eat pho, but that place really went down hill about two years ago when they changed cooks. PS8 wasn't on the top of my list back then because they were very inconsistent with their food.

About a year ago, I noticed the food at PS8 got better and stayed consistently good. If you read my reviews before, you know that I always seek out and try new Viet restaurants as soon as they opened, but nothing came close or beat PS8 so far.

Beside Pho, I highly recommend the pork chop rice dish and the grilled pork vermicelli noodle. Their soda lemonade (viet style) is the best in town. They also accept all types of credit cards.

One more thing that I'm very impressed is the fact they haven't been on dirty diners list since I moved to Vegas and that is quite an accomplishment for an Asian restaurant. (LOL)"}
{"text":"The waiter/tress were very helpful! They knew when to come and the food was delicious!!!!!

P.S. The food looked so yummy we just dove in! No picture!"}
{"text":"Love the food. It's always great. Service is lack luster as soon as they have more than 5 customers but the food is so tasty that really it's not that bad. 

Pho is pretty basic but they have awesome rice plates!"}
{"text":"The cadet hats that all the servers wear explains a lot about this place.  Maybe it's grandma working behind a built up wooden window inside the restaurant cleaning the basil for the pho'.  Better yet, it was the old retired Vietnamese solider working behind the cash register making our iced coffee.  The Pho' and iced coffee helped significant to cure the hang over after a night of clubbing in Vegas.  However the attire and attitudes of the servers are the highlight of the restaurant.  The broth was very flavorful and we thoroughly enjoyed it after being buffetted out.  Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas and need a cure for my hangover from the night before."}
{"text":"Ordered spring rolls and a #16. My friend took me here to eat and it was my first time ever having pho.

I couldn't decide between a small and a large so I went with the large. It was a huge portion so next time I'm going with the small. 

Just a 3 star because the restaurant had a weird scent to it and it could be cleaner. Service was fair but the environment felt dirty, so not sure if I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We came here 2 weeks after they opened.  Hoping this would be our pho spot on this side of town.  I was debating on their egg rolls for our appetizer, but didn't end up ordering it.  Since they're still launching their grand opening month, they offered us complimentary egg rolls.  I wasn't impress with them.  It wasn't so crispy and tasty.  It was more soft and overcooked.  We all ordered pho.  The pho broth here was more on the bland side or I would call it Americanize.  We definitely not craving it or anything.   

I prefer their location off Lindell and Spring Mountain better, even though the service isn't as good as this one.  I haven't been to the one off Eastern yet, from the reviews, it might be the one to try if I'm over in that area.

Same recipe...but different cooks makes the difference."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese from Vietnam and I must say the food here is decent, but the customer service is terrible. I've been to this place so many times since my family likes Vietnamese food and they have many other dishes besides pho, so it's not a bad option for a large party. If you order food to go over the phone then don't expect them to make it for you beforehand unless you come in and pay first, or at least that's always the case for me. The last time I was there to pick up some food they didn't have it ready for me so I ended up waiting, and when they're done they didn't even bother to bring it to me while I was sitting in the front wondering why it was taking so long. The crispy noodles were not that crispy and I was very disappointed considering it used to be very good. I have had many bad experiences with the customer service I don't think I will return any time soon. Some of the waiters are rather rude. But overall the food is alright, I've had better."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLY RUDE SERVICE. If you want to be ignored completely for simple things such as water please eat here. If you want to call to ask a question and the person that answers yells at you please call here. Enough said. Can take my love of pho else where."}
{"text":"The best pho in town!! My girlfriend introduced me here and now we're regulars. Great restaurant, food comes quick and pretty chill. I love this place!"}
{"text":"So far this is the best pho I have had in Henderson.
Was seated fast and the service was really efficient, no room for idle chit chatting but I am okay with that.
Pricing is pretty standard for the many pho places in town.
Broth was very good and the meat was tender.
No oxtail option which makes me sad, but maybe i just needed to look harder.
I didnt really need the spring rolls, but it gave me something else to compare with others.
Had a nice flavor as well.
Decor is nothing spectacular, but the place was clean.
Still have a couple others to hit before I can decide which is my favorite pho."}
{"text":"I come here during the summer when it's 118° just for their pho. Pho Saigon 8 has the best pho in Vegas.

I could sit and drink the broth all day long. The noodles are an added bonus. And a little siracha, a little sweet sauce, toss in some bean sprouts, basil and a few jalapeños and you're set. 

Very friendly wait staff, usually pretty quick with seating, getting drinks and taking your order. 

I don't know what I'm going to do when I move to LA!"}
{"text":"This pho place is close to my house. I'm so glad I have a good pho place near by. Their spring rolls are delicious! I'm not a vegetarian and their veggie spring rolls are a must try! I was surprised how good they actually were. Their broth is pretty consistent in a good way. I usually get the combination pho and the fried egg rolls as well. I haven't been disappointed in any of those dishes and will continue to come here. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the older Asian lady is kind of rude other than that everything else has been great."}
{"text":"I'm Asian...totally grew up with pho as a staple in the house...so....I know my pho! 

ALL Asians on Yelp say that...but BELIEVE US! It's completely relevant and comparable to having an expert in PHO-logy giving you an expert opinion!!! 

With that being said...
I was pretty excited this morning when all of the family agreed to have pho today...but so disappointed that I wish we had just gone with the latter and went to a buffet instead...

So here is how this Pho-day went:

11:36am Arrive at Pho Saigon 8
Homeless looking man sitting just inside the restaurant door opens the door for us...weird...but ok. 

We are seated immediately...good.
*Restaurant decor...meh.
*Restaurant size...kinda small.
*Restaurant seating...elbow to elbow.
*Restaurant ambience...bland...just like the soup. 
We scanned the menu and hubs notices a taped piece of paper in the menu that says \"Consuming raw meat may cause illness\" or something along those lines...I see their reasoning for putting that I the menu...but that is hella hella discouraging and bothersome! 

This female server (probably in her mid-late 20s) was the rudest B!7H ever...idk if she knew how to speak English or she was just having a bad F¥King day...but REALLY?! If you don't like your job go work in some other industry! This is customer service slap your smile on and sell the damn restaurant!!! 

She took our order for food...she seemed to speak decent English so I'm not gonna blame anything on that...but when my daughter, her friend and I have to say \"The number 3\" a dozen effing times and you still don't effing understand that it is NOT a #30 and THEN get a funky@$$ attitude about it after I held my fingers up so YOUUUU can understand. You better be glad my ghetto@$$ didn't come out for real! On top of that she NEVER asked if we wanted to order any drinks...my husband had to yell at her from across the restaurant as she scurried away to do idk what! 

All of that threw me off so bad I kept saying under my breath, \"I don't want to be here I want to leave...I don't trust the food that is going to come out after all that.\" But hubs wanted to just eat and run because football was on. So we stayed...ugh.

Our food came out at a decent time...no need to wait. My daughter's friend ordered just the vegetarian spring rolls for herself she was still hungry after finishing that and asked to order the \"Vegetarian Pho\"

CLEARLY labeled...\"VEGETARIAN\" on the menu but the second server that waited on us (who was much more pleasant) stated that they use chicken for their vegetarian pho broth... CHICKEN BROTH.,.in their VEGETARIAN pho!!! That completely defeats the purpose of vegetarian dummies!...keep away non meat-eaters keep away!

Finally...my own food...so so so disappointed that even my PHOto was sad....the large bowl here is more like a small bowl at any other pho restaurant in town...maybe even smaller! Their satay is red chili paste...not true Satay at all. They use purple onions in their pho....kinda gross to me because it gives the broth a flowery sweeter kind of flavor...i like red onions but I feel pho has absolutely no place for them. I had no fish sauce, or salt in the immediate area to fix the broth...and trying to fix something that should be so simple to make in the kitchen bothers me bad!

I'm going to stick to my own home cooked pho or if I'm lazy go to Pho Kinh Do for now.... This place was such a huge disappointment! 

I just read in one of the tips on yelp that they have a C grade?! Wtf?!? I wish I wish I wish I would have seen it for myself otherwise this review would have never happened! 

1 STAR for making the 1st server go away and letting the second server tend to us....(She and the fact that Yelp doesn't allow me to give negative Stars are the reason why you got 1 star from me.)

Btw...we ran into that same homeless man again an hour later only this time he was standing in the entryway of SF Supermarket just down the street and later being pursued by an angry cell phone wielding Asian man....makes me wonder what he was doing at the restaurant if he wasn't a patron.


I miss Pho Ca Dao in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS stop by here before leaving Vegas. Nothing like a hot bowl of pho to end a weekend of indulgence. Honestly one of the best restaurant pho's I've ever had! We used to go to Kim Long but now I think their menu values quantity over quality... Pho Saigon 8 is the place to go for pho! Food- great! Parking- easy! Service- good! And there's never a wait."}
{"text":"I thought i was going to pho 8 for their crab udon soup but accidentally came here instead.  The crab udon soup was really good, thick broth and well seasoned.  Unfortunately their pho was only okay.  Broth was a little bit under seasoned and their rare beef was overcooked when it got to our table"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.  I love the \"banh canh Saigon\" and \"bun cha Hanoi\".  The food tasted so fresh and the staff was so attentive. The owner even gave us a free sample of milk tea...so delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday evening and I had the pho Tai  (with rare eye round steak)...broth was good. The filling in the crispy egg rolls was amazing and the sauce that came with it was light not too heavy which was good. The service was friendly and fast. Great experience over all!"}
{"text":"Consistently efficient service, often getting our food within 5 minutes of ordering.  Our family really appreciates as well the consistently yumminess of the pho.

Personally, I get the vermicelli dish with grilled marinated pork and egg rolls.  I usually use just a bit of sriracha and this meal leaves me perfectly full as well as not walking away from dinner with a sluggish, food-coma type feeling.

Best pho place in Henderson and such a convenience being able to enjoy quality pho without having to drive all the way to Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Food is good but no service at all ! 
Do not dine-in if you do not  like 
your dinner ruined by snotty and rude service. 
Every one seems miserable. I reapeat everyone.  
They forgot to bring my food out and when I asked I was 
did you order at all ? hey my companion is half way through
his I did not come to just sit and watch others eat their meals. 

I had to ask for everything twice as the first no one seems to care or 
pretended they do not understand ENGLISH.  
When finally done I asked for my check
and the waiter pointed  me to pay in the counter  
using our table number.  I told the register why no one could 
bring the check over and she rudely told me she could have brought it over if I asked her but hey why would I walk over all the 
to the front just to ask register to bring my check.  
After I paid she did not even gave me a receipt I had to ask for it. 

WILL NEVER GO BACK - I WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED LIKE A HUMAN WHEN I PAY FOR MY DINNER !"}
{"text":"The Pho here is pretty solid.  The service is fast and they are always nice.  I usually get the #14 small, which is the rare steak and tendon. YUM. This is a usual lunch spot for me and one of my dear friends.  She always orders a dish that is not Pho, surprisingly.  It's grilled lemongrass chicken with eggrolls served over noodles. It always looks amazing!

Their eggrolls and spring rolls are both delicious!  This is also close to my house so that's a huge plus."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to enjoy great noodles.

1.  Spring Rolls - Had the Vietnamese Spring rolls here and it was very tasty! The dipping sauce and taste was very nice.

2.  Pho - we had the chicken Pho and also a meat pho with brisket, flank,tendons. I thought the tendon was undercooked, yet it wasn't and it was delicious.

3.  Broth - I liked it very much. It was clear, and had a nice taste of beef with green onion. Very subtle to me.  After I got the tasted down, I did throw some chili sauce into it, so, that altered it afterwards.

4.  Ambiance and others - Very small and nice, always crowded, and it a place where parking can be a challenge due to the large LVAC in the same log.

5.  Service -The staff are all young and very service oriented. You pay at the cashier and I have no idea how they remember what everyone ordered to give you the bill, yet they do!

I do love to have soda and they serve soda here in a can which is not as tasty to me as fountain and this means you will have to pay for refills......

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food were cold from the broken rice (egg quail is super cold, probably they take out from the refrigerator ) . The beef broth from Bun Bò Hue ( spicy beef noodles) was cold as well and there is no taste as spicy as their description. There is a short hair inside my Pho (beef noodles) .  The fresh lemonade is just taste as raw water with probably 2 steps of lemon squeeze in. I got stomachache after having my dinner here. The food is really really baddddd !!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. This hits the spot when I need a pho fix. They make a great variety of things and they are all tasty"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The Pho is amazing and they serve several other dishes as well. My wife always gets a meat dish that tastes fresh off of a bbq and shares that with my daughter; a very tasty dish as well. Service is good and i havent had any complaints so far."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. I've been here quite a few times but today when I was eating their veggie spring roll I found a couple of hair strains in my food. YUCK! I almost threw up everything else I ate. It's probably an honest mistake but that's disgusting. I won't be returning. I like my food hair free thank you very much."}
{"text":"Review: Beef stew with egg noodles

Instead of staying at the casinos and middle of the strip area to eat, we decided to look up a high rated pho joint. We picked the right spot and the drive from the Venetian wasn't far compared to driving from SF to Vegas. 

Soup was very flavorful and thick which was awesome. Had beef chunks...a good amount of them in the bowl- not chewy or dry at all. The noodles were a little thinner than what I'm used to, but this is at a different area so I shouldn't fault that- chewy noodles and fresh. Also had a couple carrots in the bowl which was nice..it wasn't cook all the way through to where it was soggy and I thought it was just right. 

I always ordered the beef strew with egg noodles in S.F at the usual spot I go to and thought it was pretty good, up until last weekend. Pho Saigon 8's beef stew was so good...I can't subject myself to anything lower. 

Oh yeah....I went there a second time and ordered the same thing right before hitting the road and driving home. Again...it was awesome."}
{"text":"If you're not near chinatown, this place is a good replacement if:
You don't mind sitting on your neighbor's lap
Dirty tables in abundance
Service is slow, unfriendly, and sometimes wrong

But, it serves the purpose. Next to yogurtland so you can get a delightful treat afterwards."}
{"text":"A must for anyone looking for delicious Vietnamese Cuisine. Very affordable prices and they offer great variety in their menu. Great location, and service. My favorite: #21..Large! :-)"}
{"text":"How does one ever choose which Vietnamese restaurant to go to when they are everywhere and their names are only differentiated by a number?  Because someone else must bring you there first, and that brings me to Pho Saigon 8.

A packed place on Saturday afternoon, a bit of a wait for our party of 7.  It gets a bit crowded by the front because people are waiting to be seated while other people wait to pay.  (Note: You pay at the register after your meal, so don't wait around at your table for the check 'cuz you won't get it.  Just remember your table number when you get to the register, otherwise you'll be one of those dorks who has to walk back to the table just to find out what your table number was.)

I had a typical bowl of pho with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Accompanied with it came the standard fresh bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, lemon, and jalapenos.  This place also provided some other leafy green to throw in, which is always a plus.  I don't mind the lemon, but sometimes I do like the lime in my soup though.  

Like all typical pho places, all the tableware is on the table for you to help yourself with.  However, this place only provides a limited amount of napkins, not the whole napkin dispenser like some of my other favorite pho places.  I can be messy, and my nose is constantly dripping from all the sriracha sauce I use, so I like to have an endless supply of napkins available for my disposal.  

Overall, a decent place.  Their menu is quite extensive, so you're bound to find something for everyone in here.  They even offer durian milkshakes, which is something you can't find or smell anywhere.  It gets crowded though, and to me, that's a good sign in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.

Update: 04/23/07 - Went back and tried their Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.15), which is grilled chicken (or sliced pork) and egg rolls with steamed rice.  I replaced it with their French rice for a bit of variety.  I've been missing the five spice chicken rice plate from PPQ in San Francisco, so that's why I decided to try their version of chicken rice plate.  It was definitely disappointing!  No skin or much taste at all.  Service was blah, I had to ask for tea twice and it didn't show up until after my meal came.  By then, I didn't want my tea anymore.  I know not to try their chicken rice plate again.

Update! 10/10/07 - Brought some out of town guests for some pho and this was our safest bet for them.  I ordered 18. Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet (Small $6.35).  One friend really enjoyed the soup here.  He said it had a lot more flavor than some of the other pho joints he's been to, mostly in the South Bay.  We also ordered the 7. Banh Xeo ($7.50), also known as a Vietnamese pancake.  The crepe was lighter and crispier than the one I had at Pho Hung Restaurant, but it wasn't loaded as much.  It came with a mountain of greenery to eat with your crepe too.  You can't complain that they are being skimpy on the fresh veggie stuff, that's for sure!  The BF ordered 37. Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.00), which is beef stew served with a small baguette of French bread.  He likes to get this a lot at Vietnamese restaurants.  Another friend was really impressed that they offered red rice too since she rarely sees that on the menu.

I'll up their rating from a 3 to a 3.5.

(I added pics of our eating in the business profile this time!)"}
{"text":"Better than the other place. 
Just kidding.  
It's good pho for what's around this side of town. 
Most definitely will come back when I'm craving pho. 
Ordered a number 21. Broth was awesome!"}
{"text":"The ONLY place I will eat PHO in LAS VEGAS because it's the BEST. I've checked out many other places in Vegas but Pho Saigon 8 is by far the best. I go there so often the servers simply ask me if I'd like #11. yep... And the jasmine tea is delicious.  They use the freshest vegetables and everything is very clean.  The service is super fast and to the point- but don't expect them to hover over your table the entire time. Ask for everything you need up front when you order. And don't forget to tip well- they work hard."}
{"text":"This is my to-go place for pho, and this place never disappoints! 

I appreciate how much parking this place has, and how inside can accommodate parties large or small. Service is average, they come, take your order, give you your food, and leave you to feast. Never have they checked up on us or asked us if we needed refills or anything. 

However, their pho is excellent! Especially during slow hours, their soup base is perfect! Not too salty, and they are really generous with the amount of noodles they give. I suggest getting a large for just 50 cents more. And ask for the meat on the side if you prefer your meat to be more tender and soft. The thin slices of meat cook really fast in the hot soup and gets really hard and overcooked eventually."}
{"text":"I had to bring my review to 5 stars for the sheer fact that I return here so often. It gets my weekly dosage of Vietnamese out of the way and I actually enjoy coming back.

I have tried many items and I plan to try them all.

Good service, decent pho. If you're around the area, try it out. They have a nice selection of offerings."}
{"text":"I stopped in Pho Saigon 8 for a quick bite during lunch.  They're located right off Rainbow and 215 and have plenty of parking.  

I know some of the reviews mentioned issues with service quality and speed, but my experience was pretty good all the way through.

I was greeted and seated right away.  The server immediately said that he would bring water over and to take a look if I wanted any other beverages.

I always go for the house special when I get pho.  I like the \"everything combo\".  They didn't explicitly list out such and item on the menu.  I asked my server if they had a house special and he said \"I got you\" without hesitation.  It was really nice to just be taken care of and let the kitchen make something up for me.

My combo pho came out delicious.  The \"large size\" serving was appropriate and they definitely do fill it up.  My only complaint is that I wished they had more variety of meats in my special combo.  The best part of this experience was that I was charged the regular 9.99 rate for my special order.  That was really nice of them."}
{"text":"Pretty standard menu and good prices. Broth was good but nothing memorable. The decor and service is ok. More of a eat and leave place. Like most pho spots. Overall good food."}
{"text":"This used to be our fav Pho place, even if its out of the way for us in Henderson, clean and new shop. Sadly the service is just bad. There is a \"bigger\" gal that works behind the counter, and has the \"shoot me now, I hate my job\" attitude. There is one lady who does get customer service and does a good job taking care of customers, but she is not always there. The Pho broth is clean, not greasy, and the noodle + protein amount is generous.  Prices seem a tad higher than most places in the Valley, but I dont think we will be going much anymore."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pho, fresh spring rolls and Thai tea. Broth was very good. Not too cinnamony like most places. Minus one star for not having any sandwhiches. I was really craving for binh ma... Also they didn't have the garlic chili sauce. Not sure if its usual to not have it but back home in Hawaii, we had it everywhere."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I even tip the waiters really well. However, my friend ordered the number 58, which was disgustingly sweet,  and the chief cook  has so much pride that when we complained he would not exchange the food or give refund. Do not eat here. They don't know anything about customer service."}
{"text":"Was in dire need to get some hangover soup  \"pho\". Stopped by, ordered to go... Food was out within 5 minutes! Quick service is always a plus. The food is good. I prefer my spot in riversides flavors but this place was still good and hit the spot. The portions are large and they give you a ton of sprouts, basil, sauces when you order to go. I'd go back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"didn't think the pho tai was anything special.
it was really oily.
better than pho so 1."}
{"text":"I used go to this place a lot but not anymore. The prices went up high for a small amount of food. Soups are always mid warm to put any of cold sprouts."}
{"text":"Came here at a suggestion of BF buddy who said it was a good spot. It was nice and busy, but we got a table right away. 

My thing about trying places is a grabbing a pho and a rice plate. Solid actually. I liked my eggrolls in my rice plate particularly. Took a while to pick, their menu is pretty extensive and I appreciate that. More to explore each time..... Gotten bun also since the first time and it was also yum! I want to explore the non pho soups they offer. 

I prefer the pho broth at Pho So 1, but not the ambiance (see review- smokey). I think this is my preferred spot so far. Solid pho, plates, and bun. Atmosphere is basic but clean (is it just me or I smelled moth balls coming in?)  and the service is pretty friendly, attentive enough but don't expect a lot of checking up on you- wave em down and they'll come. Oh and pay at the counter. 

Coming back to t This is a spot I can take some of my friends who are slightly squeamish about hole in the walls...you know the type. Hahaha."}
{"text":"The pho here is really really good, lot's of meat in my yummy pho!  super love the peanut sauce of the spring roll. Always expect a crowded lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Ok-for those who have never tried Pho Noodle soup, you need to!  Pho soup eats like a meal.  They serve fresh coconuts to go with their soup, and all ingredients are fresh.  Prices are very fair, and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this same Pho restaurant for over 10 years, and the best thing about it, the flavor has never changed. Even with the second location on Eastern and 215, it has not lost its magic. The same owner, and great server and customer service. I always order #20 large with rare on the side, vietnamese rolls with their satay sauce. Mmmmmm.... Nothing but good. Soup base always rich flavored, meat freshly cut, and veggies also fresh. 
Ive tried many other Vietnamese restaurants, and if your looking for consistant flavor,  it is worth the extra drive if your going to Pho Kim Long, or Saigon 1."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious pho located in this side of town. My boyfriend and I have come in a few times (dining in and ordering take out) and they have always been consistent with their service and delicious Vietnamese dishes. We ordered take out tonight which was extremely fast. It only took about 15-20 minutes. We both ordered pho and egg rolls as an appetizer. Everything was made fresh to order. We especially loved how everything was hot even when bringing it home. Best part was that they also included all the veggies (like bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, etc) and different sauces (like hoisin, chili, and sriracha) to put in our pho. It definitely hit the spot since it's been really cold out. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has 3 and a half stars obviously they're doing something right , and I'll tell u what that is . The Pho . Me and my boyfriend had been here before and my first experience was pretty good. Service is never really good at Asian places lets just face it , we all know that . I think that once u have have had a good experience at a resteraunt you're always expecting the same . Thats definitely not the case here. First experience the service was actually good  & the Pho was really good probably one of my favorites I've tried and I've been to quite a few vietnamese pho   restaurants . The pho was ok last night not even that good barely any meat or noodles .  I tried flagging the waitress several times even as she was passing by me she blatantly ignored me as i was trying to  order some spring rolls which came at the end as I was almost done with my bowl of pho because she took it to so long for me to place the order for them . Had to ask for water which is one of my pet peeves when eating out . I'm giving two stars because I love the pho here probably wont be coming back though ."}
{"text":"Another favorite Pho place. The food is delicious like all vietnamese places i normally order the fresh egg rolls , fried egg rolls and the pork and their latte.. love the food here its pretty good prcies is pretty cheap as well the only downside to the place is the staff is not as friendly as the other vietnamese places.. I would still recommend this place if you are near this place just dont expect good service.."}
{"text":"The pho was GREAT!!!! The beef noodle soup my husband got was GREAT!!!! The service was decent. The food came out fast. The waiter was very dull, didn't smile but he tended to us quickly. In the corner in the front is where they kept the black tub to put dirty dishes. I didn't see any dishes in there (didn't really go close enough to see) but that didn't look very appealing. Nevertheless, I will continue coming here."}
{"text":"Hello to location number 3! Can you say convenient? Thank you for coming to the southwest! This restaurant is located right off of the freeway on 215 and Rainbow across from the Walmart shopping center in the 7-Eleven plaza. Inside is spacious and clean with plenty of parking out front. Service was good. Everyone was very attentive and our waters were never less than half full. Unlike the other pho restaurants the soup spoons and chopsticks are not left at the table. So if you accidentally drop one be ready to wave down a server for another one lol

Banh Canh Saigon - BEST in Vegas!! This is what I come here for always. I love the flavor and thickness of the broth with the long tapioca noodles. Bowl is loaded with straw mushrooms, shrimp, pork, and pork blood. My favorite! Will not disappoint. 

Pho Dac Biet - Good! Their broth is nice and flavorful. Definitely one of the better pho broths in Vegas.

Cha Gio - Perfectly seasoned inside. Served hot and crispy with fresh veggies and pickled carrots/radishes for you to lettuce wrap it with. Comes with nuoc mam for you to dip it in. TIP: If you want your eggrolls / appetizers to come out first make sure you tell your server that. If not the entrees will come out first.

Goi Cuon - Good

If you're looking for good pho in the southwest this is the place to be. Spacious, clean, and quick service. They have comfortable booths with like 6 big screen TVs hanging up all over the restaurant for you to watch while you eat. Will definitely be back soon for my Banh Canh Saigon fix."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere! Very clean and am so glad I got to stop by! Thank you so much for the amazing and fresh pho, coffee and spring rolls!!!!"}
{"text":"Officially my new favorite Pho restaurant. Pho Kim long is definitely on my favorites as well, these two restaurants are head to head. So if you near by and like pho this is a spot you wanna check out!"}
{"text":"I have been there 2 times in one week. That's how yummy this place is. 
The reason I like this place so much is because it is much more tasty than other Vietnamese restaurants I've tried out. They have a large menu so you have much to choose from. I only had take out, so I'm not sure how the service is other than take out. Try this place out if you like Asian cuisine. Man, I'm hungry now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I come to this place often and I'm always satisfied. I'm a creature of habit so I stick with the chicken breast soup, it just doesn't get any better than that. I also typically get the combination fried rice which is absolutely phenomenal! The service is always good and your food is on your table in a short amount of time. What also drives me to this place is the affordability of it all. I like the fact that I can grab a good meal and not break the bank for it. And being that it's down the street from my house, this has definitely become my \"go-to\" spot."}
{"text":"I always find myself coming here whenever I'm hungry and want something that doesn't break the bank. I always say I'm going to try something new whenever I come, but I always end up getting the #31... chicken breast w/ rice noodles; You really can't go wrong with it. Lately they've been a little slow when it comes to taking my order but they never fail when it comes to bringing out the food quickly. I also highly recommend their fried rice... Just trust me, you'll looove it!! I've never gone to any other phô place and I'm honestly okay with that because this place just works for me! Lol. What I like about this location is that it's right across the street from the yoga studio I go to so its really convenient and the perfect place to come and grab a bite to eat after some hot yoga!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before (years ago), and it was always good food and good service. 

Most recently, I had dinner here a few nights ago. We got here around 6 or 7pm on a Monday, there was no wait, it was fairly busy, got seated immediately. But a few minutes after that, the dinner crowd started to roll in. We got there in good timing. 

Interior still looks the same since I was last here. Nice, clean, asian decor. 

I am currently on a Slow Carb Diet (protein, veggies, legumes...at least 20 grams of protein at each meal) to sugar detox and reclaim my health. That day I felt sick, so this was the perfect place to go to that night. My usual yelp habit is to look through the tips and then the reviews. I'm so glad I scanned the reviews because I read Mel C.'s review mentioning Pho with Chicken Breast! Thanks Mel! I scanned the menu at the table as well, and that was the best option for me. I've been to a couple of other Pho restaurants and that's the first time I saw Pho with Chicken Breast on the menu! I was excited. 

There's a choice of a small or large bowl, I got the small. The small was a pretty good size, filled with more than enough noodles, broth and thick slices of chicken breast. There must have been 8-10 slices of chicken breast, which was more than I expected. Score! I can't imagine what the large would be. 

I usually enjoy the noodles, but this time around because I was sick and have been cutting carbs my stomach didn't do well with the noodles. I ate a few, but they were too much for me. The noodles were pretty thick as well.

Next time, I'll have to ask for no noodles and replace them with veggies. 

Oh by the way, you can also ask for egg noodles if you prefer. They had no problem switching to egg noodles with my friend's bowl. 

Service was quick! Our food was brought to us in about 5 minutes. 

Great service, no complaints and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Las Vegas, I always come here at least once with my family. This is the best pho restaurant in Vegas that I've ever been to. The service was good and the quality of the food was great. I really liked the bánh canh cua (crab udon) and they weren't cheap about putting in more shrimp or crab. I always plan on returning whenever I take a trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here on Monday with my husband and his uncle. This was our first time coming as well as our last time. My husband ordered the banh canh tom cua gio heo (udon with shrimp, crab, and pork feet.) In the photo it looked so amazing! However when it came out, my husband swirled around the soup. No shrimp. No crab. And no pork feet. There was a thin slice of pork. My husband asked the server if he was given the right dish. The server responded that it was what he ordered. Hubby asked why there was no shrimp or crab or pork feet. The server said that the crab was broken up in the soup so it was not easy to see and the thin slice of pork was the pork feet slice because they don't give out the bones. As for the shrimp, there truly wasn't any shrimp so the server came with a seperate bowl with shrimp for him. It really didn't taste good. We are a bit picky with Vietnamese food, so we decided to never return."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this location opened just less than 5 minutes away from my house! The pho always exceed my expectation and as a promo for this new location, they're offering a free egg roll per entree purchase. Staff was very friendly and service was good. I love the fact that this location has TVs also!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places, and most reasonable too!  It only costs about $7-8 for a very large bowl of whatever you are craving.

The soup/broth is so delicious, far from flavorless and salty, this one hits the spot every time.

I have also had Many of the rice dishes too.  All visits are very satisfying.

If you have never been to an \"authentic\" Asian restaurant, I'll let you know that you need to send a friendly wave when you need something.  It isn't impolite, and is actually customary.  Keep this in mind when you need a refill on drinks."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes the pho is good. The broth is amazing. I've been all over this city and keep coming back here . I probably won't anymore because the customer service is lacking. Especially on the female side, the men are OK. The women seriously need to lose the attitudes. I don't know if it's a cultural thing but Wtf. Any who it's cheap. I guess I have to start searching for another spot. Food wise it's a four, but since service sucks it's an overall two . *** There is one nice waitress, she the youngest***

Synopsis : Customer service sucks/extremely rude/inattentive"}
{"text":"My friend Matt brought me here for my first experience with Vietnamese food and it was delicious.  The service was great.  I was apprehensive at first going somewhere that was out of my element, but a couple minutes later I was happy to be there.  Food tasted fresh, hot and so yummy.  I loved it so much I took my mom.  She polished off her bowl before I did!
I can't wait to go back again.  Now who should I take, hmm?"}
{"text":"Felt like another run of the mill Pho spots that's on any other corner. I ordered the #11 because I just like it simple sometimes with just the beef in my pho. The table we got sat to had a strong scent of mildew. Maybe it's from the rags they keep using.. but that's just a guess so it could be something else. 

The Pho tasted okay so I will give it 4 stars.. but didn't really make me scream wow. The noodle was cooked well. 

The place is a little cramped so make sure you don't bump into anybody on the way in and out."}
{"text":"I come here way too much and I love it way too much. 

This place has great Pho, Bun Bo hue, and Beef Stew with French bread. This place is constantly the best place for those items and maybe other stuff too but these are the things I go there for. 

I have been here at least 10+ times now and love it. It is my go to place because they are consistantly good. 

service: it's an asian restuarant, service is never good, it is always about how fresh and good the food is."}
{"text":"Wow they are getting a bad rep, the pho is actually good here. This stuff does not deserve thier 2.5 rating. 

I will agree not the best I have had but still good and definately worth going back. 

Tried a few things and the Bun Bo hue was hit and miss, first time soup was bland second time it was great. 

Service is usually bad but with most asian places its the norm, asian people go for the food not the service. 

One thing that was really good is the Nem (forgot the second word), ifs the pink meatballs that are not cooked (I think) with the raw garlic and chili in it. They serve it over vermacilli in one of thier bun dishes... that was good but only if you know vietnamese food. Bun bo Hue and raw Nem is not for the first timers. 

I would return again."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Vietnamese food.  The first time I ever ate it was over ten years ago and thought to myself how I'd never eat it again.  I met my ex from Seattle and moved there for about almost 4 years and everywhere I went was a Pho restaurant.  After a while I came to fall in love with their food and only in Seattle.  I swore that there would never be another Vietnamese restaurant that can compare.

Today, mom decided she wanted to eat Vietnamese and thought what the heck.  I drove on Eastern, passed the I-215, and right by the Las Vegas Athletic Club was the restaurant.  

When I walked in, mom had already been seated and luckily there was no line.  Last time we were here there was a twenty minute wait.  It's a somewhat small intimate restaurant with so many tables and chairs so close to one another.  So many people talking loudly, and plates clattering, sipping their soup loudly made me wonder if this is actually what it's like in a restaurant in Vietnam.  Looking forward to the day I find out through hands on experience.

No time was wasted and I gave my order of a #70.  I forgot the name but there was white noodles, some vegetables, herbs, barbecue shrimp, barbecue thinly sliced pork, and spring rolls.  The sauce on the side tasted like a sweet fish sauce with carrots and other ingredients to hide the gross smell of fish sauce.  I poured that in my bowl and mixed all the food around.  I haven't talked about fireworks in my mouth because it's been a while since I've felt that.  But, we're gonna talk about that in this review.

FIREWORKS!!!  When I put the food in my mouth, I literally felt like I was in the sky with fireworks around me.  I can still remember it like it was just a minute ago.  Normally, I don't like to eat past being full, but this dish was just too good to not finish.  The combination of the pork, noodles, vegetables, and sauce blended well together.  Food Network judges talks about texture a lot and this dish is not just mushy noodles and meat, but had the crunch of the vegetables and spring rolls.  The different texture was definitely there and worked very well with this dish.

Mom ordered something with seafood pho.  It was also very well made with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.  Mom added vegetables and herbs to it which gave it a playful texture.  Her pho was also great.  All the food was awesome which is why I gave it a 4 stars.  

It's just too bad that the servers were far too busy to give any smile to the customers.  They're all so serious and don't look very friendly.  I'm sure they're very nice outside of work but while serving my mother and I, we didn't get that welcome feeling like they wanted us there.  Sure, they gave us water, took our order, brought out our food and finally our check.  That's all routine.  There was no *umph* to their service.  It was just eh and blah.

3 stars to the servers and 4 stars to the cooks.  I'm sure they were in a good mood to be cooking AWWWWWESOOMMMMMME!"}
{"text":"Very good pho, bun, fresh rolls, spring rolls, good cold beer, very reasonable prices, decent service not much different than HCMC or Hanoi. Only difference is that chopsticks and spoons here are clean. Food is wonderful, great lunch and dinner, packed with Vietnamese clientele :-)"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, we love their pho and fresh spring rolls.  If my kids eat their food, it must be good."}
{"text":"Bad luck this past month on restaurants.  Pho Saigon 8 was possibly the WORST Vietnamese in Las Vegas:

Banh mi Bo Kho:  Vietnamese Beef Stew.  Thick, tasteless and bland broth.  Beef cubes were chewy and not seasoned at all.  What's worse is the side of French bread that it came with was a day old and STALE.   I told the server right away and he took it to the back without telling me a word of what he planned to do.

Pho Ga:  Ugh, could someone please tell me why yelpers are saying the broth is flavorful and yummy?  Far from yummy, the diluted soup tastes like boiled water with a splash of chicken broth and a little salt.  Could not eat half of this bowl.  

The only thing they had right:  Vietnamese coffee.  By the way, after we finished eating, 15 minutes later, the server came out with the replacement bread.   

Really?"}
{"text":"I have been obsessed with Pho Lately, and my best friend and his wife live just around the corner, so I thought we should try it. I like it. The vibe is nice( decorations were great), the food is yummy ( they even have small and large sizes for the pho!) and not pricey. It was about $10 each with a thai iced tea. I liked the fact that they had chopsticks and spoons in a little fancy dispenser on each table, along with the sauces. The waiter didn't really check on us, and we waited a few minutes to get the bill and a takeaway box, even with the usual \"turning around to find someone to help us\" look. So that's what keeps it from getting 5 stars, that's all. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Overall decent pho place, very flavorful broth with the lean steak/meatball pho. Quality of the meat was good and fresh accompaniments. One of the better pho options for the Henderson area. Service was decent, no complaints. Was just slightly disappointed when they got my to go order wrong when we were finished. 4/5"}
{"text":"Lucky for me , it was a raining nite and I found a parking space in the small lot mentioned... Unaware of another Pho ,place across the street, I decided to pop into this one for dinner with my cousin??? I see this place along the freeway, when I am driving back and forth up hwy 215, it was crowded, but we got seated right away, the food was reasonably priced, the food tasty and the service was not bad.. They had a few item on the menu that we don't see at most of the Pho  places back home in the bay area.. I was not disappointed, but maybe I will go across the street , next time I am in town to try Lemongrass Cafe.."}
{"text":"The food is good for the price but the service this time was not so good. We waited over 5 minutes just to get menus and I had to raise my voice for some one to notice me and another patron who was already eating handed me a menu before the restaurant handed us menus. I hope the next time I go back the service is better."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pho Saigon since last year. It's pretty close to where I live and only a walk away from LVAC.

I usually order the same thing -- a small bowl of their number 18 pho. Service is generally okay. I usually get my food about 10 minutes or less after putting in my order. I have tried their fresh spring rolls, they're not bad, though their sauce could use some improvement. They also do to-go orders, but I'm not sure about phone orders.

Ambiance is like your usual asian restaurant, although no matter how many times I have been there, I just can't recall whether they had music or not. It's also good for family, they can push tables together to accommodate a large party, and I think they have a different section for larger parties too.

I wish they had some kind of promo or discount for frequent customers. I'll be back again when my tummy craves for pho."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this place twice for our Vegas trip  and both times the Pho was great. Not sure if it is for a limited time but, when you come in and order, they give you free egg rolls...plus!!!"}
{"text":"I feel weird giving this place such a low review considering how many good reviews this place has received. Maybe I'm just a bit pickier than most, or it could be that there was only one item on the menu I could eat and it turned out to be a greasy mess. Unfortunately it wasn't pho either since all of their pho is beef or chicken based.

It was probably my mistake for expecting to find vegetarian pho, which I've had in all the pho restaurants I've been in from Texas to California. I guess Nevada is the exception, despite the wide variety of vegetarian cuisine in Vietnam thanks to a large Buddhist population.

My review is probably only useful for those who are vegan/vegetarian. For all others you can probably safely ignore anything I have to say about the food here."}
{"text":"Completely tasteless broth... maybe it was water.

Go to Lemongrass down the street.

Very dissapointing."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good, wooohooohooo from today forward this will be my neighborhood PHOvorite place to have my soup. It should be PHO you too. This PHOlace can be pack so plan your trip here, it can be very busy during lunch and dinner time but not bad you can be seated pretty fast. :)"}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I'm trying to get soup or spring rolls real quick. I live pretty close by so that could be a factor, but the food I order is always good! If I'm craving pho, I know I'll always leave having satisfied the craving.

Note I said the food that I order because I don't really order anything else. I always get pho, spring rolls, or some type of vermicelli bowl. My usual options never disappoint so I keep sticking to them. If I'm getting pho, I always get #16 which has rare round eye, flank, and brisket. It is so yummy and satisfying!

I love the deep fried spring rolls. They might be called egg rolls, but I'm not actually sure. It comes with lettuce, mint, and pickled carrots and radish. I usually wrap one with lettuce and make a little burrito with the extra stuff and pour some of the sauce on top. You have got to try it! Sometimes that's all I'll order and I won't even share it.

It's a good restaurant, it's clean, and it's pretty cheap, especially for knowing your food will turn out right. Not everyone on the waiting staff speaks English very well. That never bothers me but I'm mentioning it in case some people need to prepare themselves for that. Be patient and understanding, and you shall have a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I got delivery for three items - cha gio, bun thit nuong cha gio, and a Thai tea. The time was a bit later than what they confirmed it for but not too long so that was ok. Fairly disappointed with the vermicelli noodles though. There was very little veggies and meat to accompany the mass of noodles. Not to mention not all of the noodles was throughly cooked. Some was still clumped together."}
{"text":"Two lovely ladies highly recommended we try pho from this place. We decided to have it for a late breakfast Sunday while in Las Vegas. Place was half full with mostly regulars and large families. Customer service is short and polite. 
We were directed to a table (they are numbered). Utensils and sauces are on table. It is clean and so are the bathrooms. 
Rice noodle soup with roasted pork and chicken with lime, mint, mung beans, and fresh chiles on the side. Pork was so tender and delicious. Broth was flavorful. Hubby had the large and he shared a small portion with me.
Ribs with steamed rice, and a few pickled veggies. Tender and juicy meat on the ribs. They were sprinkled with sesame. I enjoyed them very much. I was also served a small portion of broth. It was wonderful  (lots of ginger). 
Overall, I'd love to return and try a cold noodle dish with veggies and a fresh roll. There are about 50 choices and I would love to also try the coffee."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give them no stars.  People beware when eating here.  Always check your food for hair and always check your bill when you leave.  We ordered fried rice and found a hair in it.

My main disappointment with this place was how they overcharged me.  My total was $45 and some change.  I paid with a $100 bill and got back $44.  Tell me does that equal a Benjamin?  Yeah, tell me that y'all deserve an $11 tip is total BS.  Man I was ready to slap a bitch.  

So, I go back to the register and tell the older gentleman, I guess the owner, that the young guy that rung me up gave me the wrong change and showed him the change I received.  The older man was apologetic and corrected the error and said that they didn't mean to do it cause it was busy. But, when I went to pay it had already died down.  The young guy that rung me up didn't even apologize that he did wrong and fkd up even as the owner tried getting his attention.  

If y'all are wondering if I left them a tip, the answer is HELL to the NO, would any of you after that stunt?  I simply just smiled and walked out.  

Since y'all hungry for tip here's one: teach your employees to calculate your customers' bills correctly.   Basic arithmetic isn't really that hard, you can learn from YouTube and I ain't got time for y'all's . To say the least I will no longer be requiring your services.  Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"Living in LA, I have yet to find anything that can compare to their vermicelli with shrimp paste!!!!! It's the best!!!! Every time I am here in LV, this is the first restaurant I will be!!! Thanks to whoever is responsible for the shrimp paste vermicelli!!!! YUMMMY...in my tummy!"}
{"text":"The first time I came in we were seated immediately and got our waters within minutes of sitting. However, it did take a long time for someone to come and take our orders. There were two other parties that were sat after us and their order was taken and delivered before us. That part annoyed me because whenever we would call someone they would say \"I'll be right with you to take your order\" but we proceed to watch them taking orders from parties who came after us.  

Anyways, the food is really good! I ordered the #70 Vermicelli bowl with pork, shrimp, and spring rolls. Their sauce for the vermicelli was delicious! I have never tasted a good vermicelli before from other restaurants so for that it'll be my go-to place. Their green onion portioning are really small so it isn't as big/ regular sized as it is at other places. They took a while to refill my water during my last couple of visits so be aware that you will have to flag down your severer a couple of times. You would have to ask for the chili garlic sauce because they don't put it out on the table with the siriacha and hoisin. My fiancè's plate and mine came out to $23 with tax, not including tip. I like their vermicelli Bowl but their service are slow when they're busy."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during dinner time and they weren't busy at all. There were probably 5 tables including us so we got greeted and seated right away. As we sat down our server was so quick to bring us our forks/ napkins, and waters. I'm amazed. The environment is beautiful and spacious. Within literally 4 minutes our server took our order, to me that's pretty quick and efficient. I ordered a large beef pho with brisket only. They don't have the brisket only option on the menu but my server was more than willing to accommodate me in what I wanted. My fiancè ordered the Sliced Grilled Pork with Egg Roll & steamed rice. 

We waited less than 10 minutes for our food and at the food window it looked like there was a manager overseeing the food being taken out so when my pho came out he asked the cook why is there so little meat and my server intervened to explain to him that I only wanted brisket. I really appreciated that a lot, the manager ensured my order was going out accurately. Then when it came to my fiancè's bowl it was semi-correct, instead of the steamed rice like he wanted they gave him rice noodles. We didn't say anything just because I'm that type of customer to accept what is given if it's a tedious mistake such as rice noodles instead of steamed rice. No biggie, the vermicelli was good anyway! Our total check was $22 with tax but without tip so it isn't bad for two people. This is a good late night pho place that remains open until 11pm so if you don't want to travel all the way to China town you have this place on Rainbow."}
{"text":"I like Pho here. Maybe MSG not add in, but delicious here and clean here. I love the food."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to vegas before leaving with a big hangover I stop by to have pho here it's way better then most pho spots in vegas I live in oc n this the only place that would be up to par for the rich flavors of the soup n served really hot not like warm like some pho restaurants"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just really want to have a nice, hot bowl of Pho.

Sometimes, the place you REALLY want to go to is closed, with no reason posted...so in those times, you go to your old standby.

Pho Saigon 8 is my standby. 

I've always had good food here, although the service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, as was the case yesterday.

I went with my boyfriend, best friend, and girl friend, and we were seated right away. 
When our server came by to take our order, my best friend said \"Can we please have someone wipe down the table?  Its VERY sticky.\"
Server said \"oh ok.\" took our orders and walked away...and did not come back.

A runner came out with the veg for our pho, and my friend said to this one: \"Before you set those down, we had asked to have the table wiped down, as its very sticky.\"

She apologized, and asked our server for a rag...and was ignored.  So she went over and got one herself and took care of the table.  

After that, we had no problems 

The food quality was standard.  Not as good as the other place I wanted to go, but it definitely satisfied the weeks of cravings I had been having!  

I'll gladly come back to Pho Saigon 8.  Its not my first choice anymore, but it will certainly do in an emergency."}
{"text":"I'v been here many time, just now decided to write a review. This is one of my favorite places to go to when stuck with no where to go. I've always ordered the same thing...bun bo hue...can never go wrong. Just that the hot weather can make you sweat quiet a bit. Once in awhile, the pho special is my other goes to dish.

The service is very fast, not always pleasant...however, the foods always fast and the quality is great. Check in and out is very fast, this would qualified for fast foods with restaurant atmosphere.

I would definitely recommend this place if you are ever in Las Vegas and looking for a good meal and not burn thru your pocket."}
{"text":"Over all, the foods are good and in large portions. Prices are reasonable. The place is almost full most of the time, but we always get seated right away. Services are not exceptional, but just enough to get good experience."}
{"text":"Authentic food, clean, services are good. Price is reasonable. I'm pretty picky when it comes to food. Will come back."}
{"text":"I typically eat Pho when I'm wanting to eat \"light\". I get the grilled chicken small bowl and I like to think it's sort of healthy. 

The last time I dined here with my coworker we both felt awful all day. I couldn't eat dinner, I had trouble concentrating at work, nauseous, etc, etc. The verdict? Insane amounts of MSG. In fairness I am relatively sensitive to MSG but this is the worst MSG reaction I've ever had. 

The quest for pho with less MSG continues!"}
{"text":"I travel from city to city and eat Pho all of the country. This was pretty good of the 40 to 50 restaurants I've eaten in this is a top five."}
{"text":"Service sucks! The noodle taste sourly today. A staff sitting on the table in the corner saw me raise my hand twice when I look at him he just look away. I had to step to the cashier to place additional order. I approached the lady using POS system, she point at another person I was like WHAT? She goes \" go talk to her\" wow really?! This place is never my first choice it's only I'm in the area. Will not come back here, ever again."}

I typically get the vegetable and tofu pho which is always delicious and hits the spot. I have this place like 2x a week. The staff is always friendly for the most part. This is my go to and love that it's conveniently close to my house! 10/10 reccomend!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick lunch or dinner. The food here is always delicious and always hits the spot.

What doesn't is their service. Usually the waitresses are rushing you, rolling their eyes, and just have an attitude. It's like they don't want to be there. Sometimes I question if it's the language barrier or not, but I don't think that's the case here."}
{"text":"Wanna talk about asian soul food? Try the beef stew at Pho Saigon 8. OMG its soo thick, rich, and hearty. It comes served with either french bread, rice, and noodles but my bf and i will always order all three LOL. its way too good to even waste a single drop. 

Okay enough with the obsessiveness. I have been to many pho shops in las vegas, little saigon, pho kim long, pho so 1 and it seems like the beef stew always comes out as beef soup. Its flavorless, oily, and watery. At pho saigon 8, you can tell the broth gets its richness from the cubes of beef and tendon and the sweetness from the onions and the carrots boiling for many hours. Since this location has opened, either one of us always orders this dish. But as usual the pho-, bun-, and the plate dishes are exceptional. The only reason why I give this place 4 and not 5 stars is because of the customer service, the waitress sat us at a dirty and sticky table and the server next came to refill our water. If you look at a typical asian family,  it seems like we care mainly about the taste/ quality of food only and less the customer service aspect. We have this 'dont bother me, dont check on me unless if i ask' kinda thing. But wiping down tables, and refilling water should be a must!"}
{"text":"Great motha phoken pho yo ! Eat here for some great pho and sexy paintings of Asian women. I wish I can take out me some pho too!"}
{"text":"Service 3/5
Food 2/5

Tl;dr meh, go somewhere else. 

Service was normal but I had the issue of huge a delay between my family's orders. We had 7 orders, 5 pho orders and 2 rice dish orders. There was a 10-15 min delay for us to receive the rice dishes. Our waitress was a bit rude, and like other reviewers reported they did try to rush us out even though there were no parties waiting.

Food:
pho with beef: broth was disappointing, it lacked any flavor. Meat was passable
Fried chicken and rice: chicken was dry and the French rice was very wet
French styled beef and rice: Beef was not tender and it was absurdly sweet.
Chicken and egg roll with rice: egg rolls were okay, the chicken was dry, but the rice was fine.

Side note: the parking lot is normally full so be prepared to park on the street or in another lot."}
{"text":"So sad to say but unfortunately, I will no longer eat here...they were featured on dirty dining and had a bunch of demerits. That must explain the stomachache I had the last time I ate there??"}
{"text":"Servers sucks there I had  to ask for napkins, forks and spoons. I paid for a large bowl and 2 small bowls, the large bowl had the same amount of noodles as the small bowl. Disappointing. Going back to Annie Pho. Sorry not sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The staff is always friendly and your food is delivered in minutes. Great go to spot for a quick meal that hits the spot."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken rice noodle dish and there was barely any chicken.  It was all
Noodles and the chicken was dry with no flavor.  They used to be a lot better.  I still think I like the pho but that's about it."}
{"text":"Comfortable spot for some quick pho.

Environment: The inside of the restaurant isn't anything special, but it is cozy. Seating is done quickly, which is most important when grabbing a quick lunch. The only thing I would say is that when we went there, there had been no music or anything playing which did make the environment a little change. It wasn't awkwardly quiet because the sound of all the customers talking to one another at their respective tables filled the air, however some type of music playing could have been welcomed.

Food: To start we got spring rolls, which were nice and fresh just how I like them. Dipping sauce was good as well. As for the pho, they had a nice sized menu with numerous options. I like the ones with a couple different varieties of meat in it so I could get one which combined flank, rare beef, and tendon. The bowl was huge and the flavor was good. Probably was not the best pho I have ever had but it can compare to other pho spots in Vegas.

Service: Service was quick and efficient which is what I would expect. Never felt like I was waiting for anything or that it was hard to get anyone's attention so I would say that I was satisfied.

Overall I would come here again if I were in the mood for noodles and in the area (especially since Monta closed, and Henderson has a lack of noodle spots in general), however I doubt I wouldn't put it up there with my real favorite pho restaurants which I would be willing to drive farther for."}
{"text":"This is my go to Pho spot in Vegas. I have yet to order anything else on the menu but I've had a variety of their Pho's. I usually just get the rare flank. Sometimes I'll feel adventurous and get the meat balls. Relaxing restaurant and a good staff"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best pho I've had. Bowls were small compared to other places and priced higher. The Brother was not that flavorful and it wasn't as hot as it should be. The egg roll was thin and lacked flavor. The staff was ok. Not that helpful and the owner just stood at the register without a smile. 

I do have to say that their chicken and egg fried rice was good but would I come back? Most likely not."}
{"text":"I don't know if this was good because I was hungover af when I came in, but this was thee best pho I have ever had.

The broth though. How can I describe the flavor...it wasn't salty nor was it too sweet, but it packed a hell of a flavor. And the beef...omfg. Shit was tender and juicy. Not overcooked and dry like some pho restaurants.

Yeah...I def killed my small bowl #22. They messed up my order and gave me the wrong bowl at first (which led me to be the last to get food out of all my friends) but I'll let that slide because this pho was just so damn good."}
{"text":"(-) A \"large\" bowl of pho looks like a regular bowl of pho to me
(-) Pricey for the amount you get
(-) It was an almost-satisfying amount of pho in the large bowl. I'm going to be looking for food in an hour or two
(-) The Che 3 Mau dessert I got had green jelly that was still slightly frozen -___-

This place is meh. Nothing too spectacular."}
{"text":"On a Sunday evening, we ordered the LG Beef steak and lean meat pho and egg rolls for 16. 

- Nice place. Entrance is a bit weird but tables are clean. 
- Wooden chopsticks with pho. come'on now...
- Expensive. Man, you can honestly get a $3 large bowl of pho in Westminster.
- Large bowls are small. Go to Pho Saigon also on spring mountain. 
- Taste great. How pho should be. good broth + meat
- Egg rolls are smaller. Also go to Pho Saigon for bigger sizes. 
- Fast service. Pho came out first in less than 5min and egg rolls came out minutes later.
- Need to give more vegetables. lame.."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday evening and ordered
1. #12 Pho tai chin, 8.05 Large 
2. #60 Com ga roti, 8.05 
for $20

- Conveniently located right off the 215. 
- Legit Viet restaurant! Cramped seating. Waiter speaks Viet to take our order. Grandma serves us our meal. Pay at the cashier after you finish eating. The only thing missing is a sign that says cash only! haha! Love it! 
- Pho tai chin: noodle soup with rare eye round steak and well done lean meat
Steaming hot when served. Broth was good, but average. I liked how the well done meat didn't have a lot of fat on it. Need more bean sprouts and cilantro. 
- Com ga roti: roasted Cornish hen, served with French rice or steamed rice, 8.05
Delicious French rice. They made it crispy and dry enough where you can still taste the tomato paste and not soggy. The chicken was a bit burnt and quite small. They did give plenty of vegetable sides and broth side soup was a good compliment. Seems like the side soup is what they would use for their wanton soup. 
- Viets eat here so you know its good.
- It takes hours to make the broth of pho bc you have to cook the bone. Just because its fast, doesn't mean its old. It's marinated. 
- Prices are cheaper than others in Henderson. I think this place gets mixed reviews since it's Henderson and expect American style service. 
- Similar to Spring Mountain"}
{"text":"Cheap filling eats on the strip if you like Vietnamese food. 

Their chicken Pho was decent, broth was good, but they didn't use just chicken breast ... so my Fiance and I had yucky looking pieces of chicken that just looked completely unappetizing. For a $13 bowl of Pho ... I would think they would only use chicken breast .... 

They brought out a lot of lime as requested .. some Vietnamese restaurants are pretty stingy with lime most of the time. 

They also have us a lot of Thai basil to put in our soup too. This was a plus."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.  Always visit on my trips from Fort Lauderdale.  Friendly service, generous portions, a lot of menu items for all tastes.  Highly recommend."}

Pho Tai: 
Nothing exciting to write home about. It was ordinary and slighly saltier than normal. 2/5

Spring Rolls:
Teeny tiny rolls and they skimp on meat/shrimp. The peanut sauce is quite salty. 1/5

Thai Iced Tea: 
Not the best place to get this from. It has a weird flavor and texture. 2/5

There are other Vietnamese restaurants along Eastern Avenue. I'd recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest environment, generally speaking. Service is fair. Pricing is low. 

Personally my pho restaurant of choice, regardless of the facts stated prior. I regular the small pho tai, spring rolls with char broiled pork, and ice coffee with condensed milk. 

Unfortunately it seems the service and the quality of the food is not consistent. In my most recent visit (4/23/2016), they forgot my pho. After reordering, it was served at room temperature. Very undesired as the raw beef did not cook thoroughly due to the soup being of lower than should be temperature."}
{"text":"There's no pho in summerlin so i google maps this place and although not the closest location this is a MUST TRY. so bomb. So lit. I loved everything about my vermicelli bowl. I got egg roll/pork/shrimp. My boyfriend got seafood pho and loved it. The Thai tea tastes authentic so that's another plus. Definitely would recommend & come back."}
{"text":"Fast service, always fresh food. Great value. I have a preference for the #15 Pho Tai Bo Vien. Noodle soup with rare eye round steak and beef meatballs. Not a salty broth like some Phos sometimes come."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have tried many, so far this will be my regular place for my pho fix 

The above was over 6 months ago. Today I found a roll of plastic wrap about an inch wide of some sort in my pho. I tried to ask the waitress what that was, she said sometimes that gets in there and quickly took it from the table and ran off. Because of that, I will not be going there again. Because I didn't like her answer. And I take off 2 stars. I will stop at my 9th check in, bye Felicia 

Haven't been to this place since I found the plastic in my pho, thought I'd see if it's worth going back, lol still the same, that old lady waitress still don't smile, bad service, so I will stay away a few years and maybe I'll try again or not. I will take another 2 stars off"}
{"text":"random viet restaurant in a strip mall - didnt even know it existed as you really can't see it from the street. they have a wide range of vietnamese food, including diff sizes for pho. one of the few places that have the tomato based crab and pork meat noodles - which came with 3 huuge blocks of blood cubes. not a fan of those but luckily was able to pick those out. 

overall, decent place for cravings."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Vietnamese places in Vegas. My regular order is #73, Bun Bo Hue. It is a thicker version of rice noodle in spicy soup. It comes with pork blood, tendon, pig feet and tripes; which is more texture than just the sliced meat or meatballs alone. Nice service and menu selections, great for casual dining."}
{"text":"I used to go to their Eastern location a lot with my family when I still lived on that side of town. And now that it's opened on the Southwest, I wouldn't have to travel to Chinatown or the Southeast for pho anymore!

The place is super clean when we were there. Utensils aren't at the tables like they normally are for a pho place. The server brings you the utensils after you order.

I either like to order pho tai, which is pho with rare steak, or a pho tai bo vien, which is pho with rare steak and meatballs. You are able to either get a large bowl or small bowl and they're usually $1 difference. When I went with my husband one night, I was so hungry that I ordered a large bowl of pho while he ordered a small bowl. When they came with our food, they gave me his small bowl thinking it was mine. Hahahaha. 

I love pho because most places have piping hot soup and if they don't, they're horrible. And the best thing about Pho Saigon 8 is that their broth is actually very decent! It's always consistent whenever I go to the Eastern location and I imagine the Rainbow location would be the same. The broth isn't watered down or overly salty. It's not sweet either! Yes, there are pho places where their broth is sweet.  

Also, if the broth sucks, I typically pour a gallon of sriracha into it but here I don't! 

The prices are a bit higher than most other pho places but not by a lot. If you're hungry, always get the large one! 

Also, their egg rolls are pretty good too :) If pho doesn't fill you up, get an order of their egg rolls!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for pho in Vegas!  Excellent broth, fast service, ample portions, and plenty of options."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry, Pho Saigon 8, but I'm no longer one of your fans.  My family and I have been regular patrons here whenever we need our \"pho phix,\" but it just doesn't seem the same anymore.  Sadly, the quality of your food has gone away.  I don't know if you are cutting costs with a sub-par ingredients list now, but your food doesn't quite taste the same anymore.  Add to that that some of your menu items have gone up in price which seems more difficult to swallow.

Twice in the past 2 weeks we've dined here, and twice we've gone home feeling some kind of indigestion - both of us, and both our kids.  It's weird to explain this, but we have to attribute it to what we had eaten there.  It is all too coincidental.

Any pho you select here is delicious, but something just isn't right anymore.  It has got to be the freshness or quality of the ingredients.  I had even tried their Bun Rieu, vermicelli noodle and crab soup, for the first time and left here feeling less than satisfied.  The crab meat just didn't taste fresh.

Lastly, according to the server, they've changed the way that they make their Da Chanh and Soda Chanh, fresh lemon drink and fresh lemon soda.  It tasted different this time around; even my son thought so, and you know kids' palates...you change a simple ingredient and they can taste the difference immediately.  They either put some weird syrup in it now or they use different lemons or limes...hard to say, but it had a strange, almost close to a lychee-flavored taste, to it.  Unfortunately, they forgot the key ingredient - \"freshness.\"  They should have stuck to their original way of making it.  It was very thirst-quenching then.

Bittersweet Adieu..."}
{"text":"There was about a year and a half where my best friend and I came here every Monday for post-workout pho, sometimes, even without having actually worked out. As far as Vietnamese entrees go, I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface, but I've had vermicelli (cold noodles with veggies, meat and fish sauce), rice plates, pho (noodles with assorted meat, usually in beef broth) and the French-Vietnamese sammiches. This place wins at the first three. I actually haven't even checked the menu to see if they have sandwiches because the other stuff is pretty darn good.

Both the fresh spring rolls (pork and shrimp), and the deep fried spring rolls (wrap them in lettuce with pickled veggies and dunk in fish sauce) are good ways to jump off the meal. For drinks, I like their hot tea and the Thai tea was surprisingly good as well.

In terms of actual belly filling picks, I prefer either pho or vermicelli to the rice plates, and depending on the season, will heavily lean towards one or the other and consistently order that every time. Obviously, when cold, I'll get pho, and when it's hot, I'll order vermicelli (try the grilled pork with fried spring rolls!).

I've tried Pho Kim Long (har har har), and felt it just didn't stack up to Pho Saigon 8. This is definitely my favorite Pho place in Vegas."}

No AC last time I was there & it was unbearably hot inside. Table next to took food to go. That may have been a temporary thing I hope..."}
{"text":"Good for a night out partying. It's pretty good here, but like I've said in prior reviews, pho basically always tastes decent to me. I did feel like there was a lot of meat, and I really liked that. There were a couple of complaints though: The eggrolls that we ordered was a little bit too greasy though, but the meat packed inside was decent. Also, compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in LA/SoCal, I kinda feel it was a bit pricey. Furthermore, the service with us was extremely lacking. A group of Vietnamese guys came in about 15 minutes after us, sat next to us, and ordered after us, and were finished with their meals before we even got our soups. Made us feel like if we were Vietnamese, we definitely would have received better service."}
{"text":"Before I was introduced to pho-milan.  I would always go here especially since it was right next to LVAC and I would usually come here for a quick bite to eat after the gym or craving for some vietnamese food.  

The food was just okay nothing amazing.  
Spring Rolls: It is usually a hit & miss thing. Sometimes its tasteful and sometimes is very bland.  When its bland I would have to use a lot of the dipping sauce to have some taste to the spring rolls.

Pho: I normally dont order pho, but when I finally did, I hated it.  I forgot what I ordered but it was not great at all.  It was cold and I asked them to reheat it, but one of the servers didnt understand what I was asking.  They had to ask another server to figure out what I wanted.  But after they reheated it, it wasnt something I would order again. 

Pork&Rice: I usually order this and in order for me to enjoy it. I would always use the pho's broth that they bring on the side and I would add it to the meat and rice to have more flavor to it.  

Service:  They normally dont smile when you enter their restaurant and only one or two of them is friendly.  I would have to flag them down to re-fill my glass of water and ask for the check."}

I always get the spring rolls, pho tai and the shaken beef dish. Quality of food is always good here and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"I may not be the biggest Vietnamese food fan.  The food was just ok.  
Ambiance, eh, service and overall, just ok."}
{"text":"Very poor service, food is not as good as it is rated. Waiter expect us to grab our own food and make us grab our own need. Overall very bad experience."}
{"text":"Food here is really good dont get me wrong my family and i come here often . But this one time we order to go the lady at the regester is so dam rude on the phone . When i got there she was still rude i wanted to tell her off so bad i will be going to pho king up the road from now on this is what that scum look like !!"}
{"text":"Cheap & quick service. Solid place for Pho Dac biet & Bun Bo Hue, they are not skimpy on their serving of beef. This is one of their better locations, especially better than the one on spring mountain. I do recommend getting a side of their egg rolls. This is our place to go on a Sunday. Not too crowded either."}
{"text":"Noodle soup, served piping hot with fresh condiments, like cilantro, basil, and bean sprouts.  Good for cold winter night, or when I crave a good pho.  It's the big bowl with plenty of broth, vegetable, meat and noddle, which is a bit fat, almost like spaghetti noodle, but is good.  

Here the service is quick, attentive despite how busy this place is."}
{"text":"Great pho very authentic, tasty. Win."}
{"text":"Feeling hung over so stopped in at new pho place for a to go order.  Place was very clean neat and new.  Was welcomed by a nice lady, who took my to go order and even offered me cold water while I waited.  About 5 minutes later, she brought my to go order, very neatly packaged!  Raw beef slices were even bagged seperate!  Still steaming hot when I got home, flavor is excellent, good traditional broth, healthy portions of meat in both the chicken and beef pho.  Meat is tender and everything was perfect.  This is my new go to pho place close to home!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot for pho, especially when the whole family is in town, but we took about a yearlong hiatus after we had a couple of bad experiences with service and decided to head down the street for our Vietnamese. We came back recently and the food was good and the service was better because we went during a non peak time. It will usually be busy when you go in, and because of this, service can be inattentive. Generally, your server will also be curt with you, that's the way they always have been and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

The pho here is consistently good. Everyone in my family, except for a select few, always order pho. I usually get #16 (I am not going to remotely attempt to spell any of the dishes) which is rare eye round, flank, and brisket. They'll bring you as much of the accouterments needed for your soup also. Even though it doesn't take them long to bring out your bowl once you order, you can tell the broth has been cooking for hours. The deep beef flavor is easily detectable along with the aroma of spices like star anise and clove. A big squeeze of sriracha for heat is the only other thing that I usually add to my soup.

I have had a few of their rice plates and they are satisfactory. The kids will always want an order of shredded pork spring rolls to start and they usually don't last too long. Pricing is affordable, usually right around $$ per person depending how many large bowls and sodas are ordered. Heads up also, check your bill before you pay because they'll tack on 15% gratuity for your party (it may be posted on a small sign in the front) and not say a word when they give you the check or after you've signed off on an extra 20% tip. Ultimately it's our fault for not looking over the check, but you're welcome Pho Saigon 8.

The pho is good enough to keep us coming back occasionally, but not good enough to overcome the service to make us regular visitors."}
{"text":"I ordered some wanton soup with egg noodles instead of traditional pho this time.  I would have to say my soup lacked in flavor, but the wantons themselves were tasty. I haven't had a fantastic spring roll in a long time, if anyone finds the absolute best please let me know. That being said Pho Saigon 8's spring roll were ok.  I would come back only for the pho."}
{"text":"This is the worst place i have been to.. service sucks and bad customer service!! We had to ask for water more than 5 times before getting some water.  Order took along time to come out and food wasnt that great"}
{"text":"This was recommended by a Vietnamese co-worker that said (put popular billboard pho restaurant here) was \"trash\" and said to go here instead.  I was immediately pleased when the restaurant was spacious, clean, and filled with Vietnamese people and not tourists like me.  

I order my usual:  Small combination with no tripe and an order of the fresh spring rolls.  Great broth compared to other pho places because I couldn't taste the sink water taste I often taste in other pho places.  They have a good amount of meat and I am very satisfied with the amount of food.

Service was friendly and most of the time they don't write down your order and I wonder how they get it right most of the time.  

They do accept major credit cards so it's NOT CASH ONLY.  Another reason why I like going there because they do accept credit/debit."}
{"text":"Impeccable service.  Delicious pho and spring rolls.  Quick, clean spot for lunch.  It was super busy when we walked in but they had a table waiting for us. By the time we were done the lunch rush was over. Thai tea was great."}
{"text":"Already ate here at least 10 times.  Its the best Pho place i have tried in Vegas,
It actually reminded me more of food in Garden Grove CA.
The quality has been pretty consistent.
The place is clean, and the service is good."}
{"text":"Usually I LOVE this place. Me and my boyfriend go here all the time for the yummy pho but my most recent trip here was sO ANNOYING. First we called ahead to take our food to go and they told us it would be ready in 10 minutes. Okay so to kill time we went to yogurt land (which is next door) and made our way to the restaurant and our food still wasn't ready. We we're told to sit and wait at the tables by the bathroom, so we did. Ten minutes later some customers come in and THEY KICK US OUT of the booth! There were other tables to seat them why they gotta kick us out and our food still wasn't done. We wait another ten minutes and I decide to tell them wassup like why am I waiting 30 minutes for them to give me some broth and noodles in some styrofoam? We didn't order anything fancy just the regular noodles and broth smh."}
{"text":"People rave about this place. After having tried a Ramen place the night before in China Town, I thought this place was just OK, at best.

Service was very slow, they squashed us in a side table even though there were plenty of other seats, and didn't really explain WTF we were supposed to be doing.  For instance, I guess you are supposed to be wrapping the egg rolls in the large pieces of lettuce they give you??? They give you a BUNCH of stuff to doctor up your soup with, which I guess should've been my first indication that it wasn't going to be all that good.

DON'T GET THE MEATBALLS. They were nasty. Apparently, there's some confusion on meatballs and sausage in a casing?  You literally had to bite and tear into these packets of meat to get a chunk off of them. It definitely reminded me of eating an overcooked piece of sausage and way too big to be eating in one bite.

The Thai Tea was amazing but I felt for it's size, extremely over priced. In fact, the whole thing was a bit overpriced, it was almost $40 for 3 of us for lunch without tip.
Trying to get the check was a production too, then paying the check up at the front, then tipping was all very strange.

I think we all agreed we don't have to go back."}
{"text":"As a regular pho eater, I can say that pho is good here. (I am half Vietnamese and my mom is terrible at making pho so I often go out to eat it.)

The noodles are a hit or miss and since I'm a big noodle eater, this matters to me. Sometimes they are soggy but sometimes they are perfect. Though the broth is consistent and is one of the best in Vegas, making this place one of the few solid pho places around Vegas. 

It is still not up to par with LA pho places, but as I have said in other reviews I have yet to eat at a pho place in Vegas that measures up.

The only thing that is below average, even for an asian restaurant (which says a lot), is the service. 

I am used the okay service of asian restaurants where the waitresses are often overwhelmed with too many customers and often forget things and don't have enough time to give you a lot of time, so that doesn't bother me. What does bother me is when a worker is walking around like he has nothing and they purposely ignores you. I ordered a pho from one guy working there and never ended up getting my order. He even avoided me and purposely ignored me when I tried to catch his attention . Finally another server saw me and promptly got my order, at least she was very nice. I wish I could say that this only happened to me once (and I would be willing to overlook it since I come here often) but it was not the only time and he was not the only guy that did that."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. The only reason I gave two stars was because the food was pretty darn great. I had dinner here with my mom and the whole time the waitress and waiter (we were served by both) had an attitude and were rushing us. The waiter asked for our order as soon as they handed us the menu and we asked for a few minutes. He came back two minutes later and asked for our order and again we asked for a few more minutes because there's like a thousand items on the menu and it was my first time there. We finally ordered and the waitress came out and brought our food since our waiter was on his break having his meal at the table in front us us. We had the pho ga, shrimp spring rolls, and shrimp fried rice. Everything was absolutely delicious! When we asked the waitress for another order of shrimp spring rolls, she brought them back to us in a to-go box. I guess she wanted us to leave so we left since we were done with their crap. This place really needs to work on their customer service. The entire time both waiters had an attitude and a mad look on their face. I am a very polite customer and great tipper everywhere I go but I didn't leave a damn thing here. I'm never going back there again."}
{"text":"I think this place has the best pho in Las Vegas.  Been here about a dozen times and it's consistently good - tasty broth, flavorful meats, and well-cooked noodles.  Service can be sometimes friendly and sometimes brusque, but it's always fast.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The number #78 is super bomb. The 215 and rainbow location is very nice and seems nicer than the others. The crispy eggroll is a must!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Pho in months.  The Pho restaurant by our home in Arkansas just vanished one day.  No Pho restaurants within 100 miles.

Saigon 8 is near a townhouse I'm renting.  It was excellent.  The sliced Brisket was very tender and the sirloin was sliced to perfection and very flavorful.  Lots of bean sprouts, basil, onion, etc to dress it up.

Service was very fast and the people behind the counter were very nice as well.  Wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"Fast and yummy...granted I usually just get the Pho, but I love it.  I can add as much or as little veggies and sauce as I want.  
I go there ALOT (coffee is sooooooo good).
I just love it!"}
{"text":"Very clean and VERY quick & friendly service.  For some reason I just don't feel like it hit the spot!  I live SW and I think if still drive to Spring Mountain for PHO.  I'm going to give it a chance and try some other things on the menu first though!!!"}
{"text":"Gosh... today I'm sick as hell and we came here for pho, tea and egg rolls. We come here all the time. I ask for Thai tea and it comes back half full. Then I send it back and she brings it back with no ice, half full. Why can't you full the fuxking cup up the right way if you want me to pay full price?! We come here allllll the time!!!!!! Irritating and poor service today"}
{"text":"Compared to other pho places, this place isn't that bad and I can see myself returning here. Although the place is fairly new, it's nice to see that it's clean inside and it's pretty spacious. I ordered #20 and it was actually loaded with meat which I was thankful for. The soup broth was a bit too oily for me but the noodles were cooked just right. It was not too hard but it also did not get too soft even after sitting in the soup for a bit."}
{"text":"Incredibly flavorful, tasty broth, with generous portions of meat (got the #21). I also got the vermicelli bowl (combo with fried egg roll, pork) and it was awesome. Generous portions that it serves as two meals for me. I've had the vermicelli bowl at Mai Lang (another Viet place in Henderson) and pho Saigon 8 is much better. 

Service: Its fast but don't expect too much from it, it's really bare bones (take your order, refill your water, that's about it). They're not rude by any means though, just business."}
{"text":"It was really just okay to me. Their pho broth was a bit bland compared to other places I've tried. I gave 3 stars for their thai ice tea. It was delicious. Their egg rolls were also pretty good but I mainly went for their soup and was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is a little hated on, but I think it's a pretty good option if you are on this side of town.  The Bun Bo Hue is not the best I've had, but definitely is one that has the most meat/pork cake/pork hock, etc inside.  It could be a little spicier, but I don't think the broth is half bad.  The grilled chicken/egg roll vermicelli bowl is pretty tasty as well, the chicken is very tender and flavorful.  There are negatives to this place, it's kind of dirty and the service is pretty bad.  Also, I've only been there a few times but definitely some inconsistencies in the dish.  One time the vermicelli bowl came without any greens....and one time I just got the regular bean sprouts when usually it's a different dish for the bun bo hue.  So not the best, but not bad for being in this area."}
{"text":"This is our go to pho place since it's a convenient location for us.  The place appears clean and is extremely kid friendly.  The portion size is generous and the soup broth is flavorful.   The meat and the bean sprouts always seem fresh. I do leave a little thirsty....so I'm guessing there's some MSG in the broth.  The egg rolls are always hot and crispy, but sometimes a little inconsistent with the amount of pepper used.  I like that they always give us a bowl and scissors to help cut up food for our toddler.  The service is always fast, we can usually be in an out in less than 45 minutes.  This is the typical Asian establishment, if you need something, it's best to be proactive and ask."}
{"text":"We were on our way back from the Grand Canyon when we decided to stop by the Walmart at this exit in order to grab a few items for our stay. Low and behold we noticed this Pho restaurant and decided to stop. 

We are regular eaters of Pho, have been all over Vietnam and this restaurant did not disappoint. Service was quick and the food was outstanding. Unfortunately we only kept a rental car for our first 3 days in Las Vegas, otherwise we would have returned several more times as the food was that great. 

On another note, do not confuse this with another restaurant called Pho Saigon that is in the same strip mall as In & Out Burger. We thought it was the same owners, but apparently not, as the other one was \"dead\" and this one was packed!"}
{"text":"Food is fine. Bun bo is spicy but great.Clean and fast service. I found this place it is very convenient and affordable to have lunch or dinner in Vegas. I tried some chicken but it was not as good as I expected since it was a little dry. Bun cha is ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I got takeout here so I can't comment on the service,which probably is ok. 
It is located in a small strip mall and appears clean and have some typical Asian decorations. Obligatory buddha some water structure. 
The food however was a huge disappointment. I didnt have the pho so maybe I'm unfairly judging but the spring rolls had lettuce that you buy at the grocery store, rice noodles, and some tofu. That's it! Where's the cilantro? Wheres the sliced carrots? The noodle with dish with chicken was very tasteless and frankly just bad. If someone ate here believing they were eating vietnamese food they might say they hate an entire country's food without a proper reference point. 

Maybe the pho is better but based on the quality of the other stuff I dont expect it."}
{"text":"Food is always good here! I noticed they did a lot of changes. New menus and appetizer are much bigger now than before. Service is always ehh. It's ALWAYS a hit a miss. You would have to raise your hand or make eye contact with the servers/bussers to get what you need. I only come here because it's closer to me. But, if I were to choose where to eat I would say Pho Mailan is so much better! It's better making the trip to go further down on eastern for amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"YUM. 

Huge fan of this place. My friends and I come here all the time when we're in Vegas. It's perfect for a lunch on Saturday because it's hearty and delicious. I always get the Pho -- the broth is flavorful, the noodles are fresh and it's just wonderful. Sure, it's not as good as some Pho places in LA, but for Vegas it's not bad at all. I'm also a fan of the Spring Rolls with peanut sauce. YUM."}
{"text":"QUICK, GOOD AUTHENTIC FOOD, AND CHEAP!!! what more do you want from a vietnamese restaurant??? they have just a handful of items on the menu, which mean they're good at what they cook, so you can go no wrong with that they're offer. If you fancy dishes, there are plenty other restaurants nearby. You come here for Pho, Bun, and broken rice with pork chop, they're the stable of Vietnamese comfort food."}
{"text":"friendly and attentive wait staff. food was pretty good and authentic, good location, i don't have to drive all the way to China town to eat, so it's a plus for me!"}
{"text":"I hate being a party pooper, but this place's menu really intimidates me.  There are a million items, and the descriptions are vague at best.  
The things we usually get (pho with rare beef, charbroiled chicken vermicelli, and spring rolls) are great, but I want to try new things.  Some of the servers speak very little English, so asking for suggestions doesn't really work.  
The last time we came in I ordered some kind of a tomato beef stew.  It was tasty, but the beef was soooo suuuuper fatty.  
If I could get more out of the menu, I would give this place 4, or 5 stars.  Unfortunately, since it can be kind of a hit or miss experience for me, I can only give them 3."}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot! My family was in town last weekend and we really were craving these noodles being that we havent had it in  a loooooooooooong time. I loved it. I got the Pho #18 plus some meatballs. the 4 meatballs arent worth the extra few bucks you have to pay for them, but it was still wonderful to eat overall. It was as close to how my mother used to fix it as i have come across here in vegas.

The serving were huge and great for the price we paid. 

 i would definitely would go back again and im sure when my family comes back into town we will be hitting this place up again. 

I guess as far customer service goes, it wasnt bad. I think it would be great if they opened one up in north las vegas being that we dont have one on this side of town at all."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a yummy Pho for a while and Yelp helped us find Pho Saigon 8!!  

I ordered a Tofu vegetable Pho while the boyfriend ordered Chicken Pho and Spring Rolls. (bill came out to $20 and change)  DE-LICIOUS!  Eric said his chicken was moist (not the usual overcooked and dry) broth was a perfect, steaming hot- but NOT burn your mouth hot.  

...Talk about FAST food, the spring rolls came out minutes after we ordered it and our Pho came out as Eric was finishing up his appetizer (and he eats fast!)

it's a smaller restaurant and was packed at 5pm (it's a good sign that the food was going to be good!).  The decor is nice, table tops are some kind of stone/granite (no booths) and it was clean.  I'm agreeing with another reviewer, it's a tight fit and the tables are a little close together and I don't recall any type of music playing.  The service was friendly, nice and quick- although there was not much rapport between us.  They were great about busing the tables and keeping it clutter-free (my pet peeve).  Must agree with another reviewer, the parking lot is a little small...   Despite the semi-negative description of the restaurant itself, don't let that stop you from eating the YUMMY food!!

I overheard customer at another table complementing the server for the GREAT food he just had.  He introduced himself to the server and told him he would be a frequent customer.. :o) = so I know I wasn't the only one Raving about how good the food was!!!

5 stars for delicious food at a great price, nice sized servings (was a bonus) and quick and friendly service.  This will be a restaurant that we re-visit a few times a month- I know it!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, very tasty Pho. Warm Saki was barely warm but was good nonetheless. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"i got it to go and it wasn't even hot. the chicken was barely edible. i basically threw my entire pho away after a few bites."}
{"text":"It's good to catch this place at 12:00pm because all the early birds got the left over broth from yesterday and by noon the new batch gets cooked. OMG I am just kidding!!!! 

I like the Pho here a lot. The broth is clear, flavorful, and oh so yummy after a long night of ??. 

I was so hungry, I ordered spring rolls, egg rolls --these two are not that great. I had Pho in a small bowl with meatball was about $7. I love it. 

This place is very busy for locals and out of towners. It just feels like home."}
{"text":"We always came here whenever we visit Las Vegas. We tried other Pho places in Vegas however, this is still the best for us. We are from So Cal so we know what would be a good bowl of Pho. No need to wait at Pho Kim Long, just drive down a couple block then you find Pho Saigon 8. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I like this place bc they are fast and less crowded and broth is not bad. I only gave them 3 stars bc the pho ga (chicken pho) is good not great and ginger sauce is okay, and eggroll filling is mushy not firm."}
{"text":"I am little disappointed today.  I've been to Pho Saigon 8 probably more than 20+ times and never had one single complaint in the past...
The size, I mean the portion of noodle got REALLY smaller (I've been ordering  the small bowl of Pho & always has been enough to fill me up), the taste of soup was a bit salty, the vegetables were dried out, and their soup wasn't hot enough.  I can't believe that their food portion size went down & their quality of food went way down stream.  I am not sure if I wanna come back and have another Pho here any time soon......

Maybe, the chef went on vacation or something??!?!?

I am not too sure if  Pho Saigon 8 is worth recommended to you as I had both pleasant and not-so-pleasant experiences.  I am confused 
-.-;;;
However, I still like their Vietnamese iced coffee a lot!
Unfortunately, I have to give this place only 3stars."}
{"text":"YUM! This is by far our favorite Vietnamese / Pho restaurant in town! The service can be spotty but the food is always consistent and great! Plus, you cannot beat the prices. Both of us eat usually for under $20 even with an appetizer!

Our favorites

Crunchy Egg Rolls $5.95
Meatball / Beef Pho small $6.75
Sliced pork and grilled shrimp with virmecelli $6.75
Thai Iced Tea $2.25

This is a new location so it is pretty nice inside. It does, however, get pretty busy around meal times so plan ahead and come a little early to get a good table. 

You won't be disappointed - that's Pho sure!"}
{"text":"boy is it cold out in vegas tonight.. stopped in here with the parentals to get warm and toasty..
i rarely eat anything else than seafood pho.. so tonight i got the small #44 which only consists or shrimp and crab! the other place i usually eat pho at in the bay area has more seafood items in the meal but since those are my top 2 favorite things.. it sounded like the perfect bowl!
my choice of beverage tonight was their fresh squeezed lemonade! 
food came out in a timely manner.. and everything looked delish..
i loved how i ordered a small but they gave me noodles as it was a large! i was totally expecting imitation crab.. and to my surprise there was real crab meat.. couldn't get better than that! shrimp was kinda bland but nothing that sriracha sauce can't fix!
taste, size, temperature of the whole thing was wonderful.. just what i needed for a cold night!
my lemonade was bomb! i usually don't care for tart sour drinks but i must say this was some good as lemonada! so refreshing to the mouth after a hot meal!
i shall come here many more times in the future! 

oh the bad.. 
not so many parking spaces for the little shoppping area its in.. seating arrangements kinda suck.. service was ok.. but they could try to come around a little more often.. and when the bill came back swiped and all.. they didn't have a customer copy receipt.. only store copy.. i personally don't care for that extra piece of paper but many do!

oh did i mention there's a yogurtland next door.. :)"}
{"text":"All i can say was DELICIOUS! i came in for lunch today with my parents 'cuz we were hungry for some viet food and it was perfect for a chilly noon time. I ordered the beef stew with french bread, crepe and egg roll for appetizer. They prolly have the best crepe and beef stew in town! And ooooohh goodnesssss the french bread was perfect!!!! It was hot, crunchy, and fluffy! From the first bite, it made me say \"daammn\" hahaha.. yes it is that delicious!! Also the crepe was perfectly cooked and very decent filling! I was really glad that it was not OILY! unlike the one at pho kim long it was soaking in oil (totally disgusting) but anyways the service was nice too! Fast and on point! 

So if you're looking for an authentic viet food in henderson this is a must go to place! And they also have another location at spring mtn. 

MUST TRY: beef stew with french bread/rice/noodles, crepe, and their viet hot coffee was delicious!"}
{"text":"The hearty beef broth here is the best! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is for the service which I'll touch on below. 

Service... there is no such thing as service in this place. Every time I've been here there is one person behind the counter that seats you and then takes your order and you never see him/her again. I always see 1 or 2 other staff members in there but they never help out. They just sit at a corner table and eat. Maybe I'm just going during their lunch breaks?! 

That said, don't come in here thirsty because you'll never get a refill on water. And to top off the water issues it's always room temperature. You'd think ice cubes are a rare commodity at this joint!

But yes, still 4 stars because the pho (broth mostly) makes me happy in my pants!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pho place in Vegas! I had a couple go-to places for pho before but after Pho Saigon 8 opened, this is my only place to go in Southwest area.

Food is great! I always had meatball pho because it will come out safe everywhere I guess.. but their meatball itself is already different, it's more chewy and just a better grade quality I could taste. So I decided to try Bun Bo Hue as well, and I was impressed! 

The main reason I will return her is because if the quality of food they serve, cleanness, and presentation. The environment is always clean, and my vegetable plate for my noodles are always fresh, clean, crisp, and well organized on the plate. Service was welcoming and friendly. Although they are not 'great service' like fancy restaurant, but among Vietnamese restaurant I think they are fast, hardworking, and knowledgeable.

Although for pho restaurant it's a about $1-$2 more expensive than some places, but I think it's totally worth it if they continue to provide this quality of food, environment, and service."}
{"text":"Pho is a challenge in this city. I have not found a really good place yet, but Pho Saigon 8 can make the cut of being decent.

The taste of the broth is a lot better than all the other pho restaurants in the city, as it wasn't as oily. The only bad part is that there was MSG in there, and a lot of it! I got really thirsty afterwards, and I got a headache! Ehh....I would have given it 5, but the taste just got to me afterwards...In addition, the service was just awful after our food came. Our drinks and food came right away, but when it was refill time....not a soul came by to visit! We even asked for refills when we did find someone, but we waited too long and decided to leave... BOO!

If I were to choose a place for pho, this would be it (as I have no other choice...)"}
{"text":"I am not too picky with pho, HOWEVER, this place soup base tasted really really salty! MSG??? and BIGGEST let down was their MEATBALL tasted like RUBBER! never ever did I encounter that in ANY of pho restaurants I've been to. Their price is higher than other pho restaurants, and the servers took very long to take order, and didn't seem to know what they were doing. Like if you see an empty water cup pushed to side of the table...of course....you want more water! spring roll was bland and very bad! will not go back!"}
{"text":"Love Pho! Have only had it a few times. Small bowl was plenty and the taste was amazing! Shrimp spring roll was cold and dipping sauce delicious. Right off freeway so will be an easy stop again. Most customers were Vietnamese, so you know all the food is good. Waiter recommended the type of Pho we had. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't even eaten the food yet, but I'm with my 83 year old dad while pushing my sick mom in a wheelchair.  One of the older female waitresses was walking in at the same time as us and got to the door before we did.  She looked right at me, then at my mom in her wheelchair, opened the door and let the door close in my face.  What a BITCH!  Nice job at making my experience horrible before even eating the food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here like 3 times already since i've moved from California. Living in cities like SD, LA, and the SF Bay Area where I would constantly find myself eating at Pho spots over a million times, I was a bit scared to see what Vegas would provide for my Pho cravings.

So far I've stumbled upon this place and the Pho is ok. The broth has the usual flavor, but I think I've had more flavorful broths eating in spots like Pho Ca Dao in San Diego and Jasmin Garden in San Francisco. But I will say the large bowl of Pho can hit the spot when you have the craving.

I have also had their wonton egg noodle soup. Pretty basic. Noodles have a soft texture and the wontons break a part easily--making it a pleasant experience eating together. I'm sad they didn't have the spicy chili oil sauce they have in some Vietnamese/Chinese spots.

Their fresh spring rolls are good as well.

In a way, I think their food is a tad bit over priced compared to some mom and pop Vietnamese restaurants I love going to in California, but ehh i'll get over it. 

Another thing is that they have a limit of $10 when using credit cards. Since sometimes I usual eat by myself for dinner, it's kind of annoying.

So overall, the place is just OK in my book."}
{"text":"This place is addictive. Never seen it empty and the most iv had to wait is a couple minutes. Service is really fast and out of the dozen times iv been here they've always gotten my order correct. 
  As far as the food I usually get the #16 pho and maybe some spring rolls or egg rolls. Both are amazing! Best pho around by far. And also the house hot tea is a mixed blend and awesome. 
   I definitely recommend this place. You will be hooked"}
{"text":"Pho Saigon 8 is the best pho spot off Spring Mountain Road.  I know this because each time I'm in Vegas, we always leave the strip and have Pho for breakfast.  Sorta helps us recover from the activities the night before.  We've tried almost every Pho restaurant in Chinatown / Spring Mountain Road.

The first time I went, I tried their beef stew with french bread.  The beef stew was very good.  The beef was very tender and was just right in flavor.  The soup wasn't thick and it wasn't watery so the consistancy was perfect.  The french bread was warm and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The best beef stew with french bread I've ever had.

The next few times we went there, I tried their special combo Pho.  The broth was tasty and you could taste it was simmered.  They use red onions instead of white onions and I think it drew out the flavor quite nice.

The iced coffee was very strong - the way I like it!  I defininitely think Pho Saigon 8 is the best Pho restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star for its food!! Its service is a 3.5 on average lol

We first came to this spot since it was so close to home. It really kick started our pho love. We have tried other places and have now decided this is our spot!!! The broth is amazingly flavored. They give generous portions so if your not a big eater the small would fill you up. 

Our meals consist of #13 beef broth with raw rib eye and flank, with a side of broccoli... Get it raw the broth is so hot that it will cook thw rib eye to perfection. #18 raw rib eye, flank, tendon, and tripe. We also start with #1 crispy egg rolls that come with generous lettuce and mint. Overall this place has the best Pho in Henderson!! No joke! 

The service is spotty. However, we are willing to deal with it for the quality and freshness of the food. It is best to order everything you need before your server leaves to enter your order. Also, if you need a refill on your drink move your cup in eyes view they are ninjas when it comes to refills. We have never had a server be rude they are just usually pretty busy and they are there to get things done. It is very clean and it is not a place to lounge. 

If you live in henderson and you are in need of some dank Pho this is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho in town. They have another location I go to but took about 30 min to get there. Glad they opened one on my side of town. I always get the combination pho #18. Their food is pretty consistent with their other locations."}
{"text":"Good pho tai bo vien & bun bo hue here, worth the money. Customer services are good.  Nothing can be compare to the foods back in oc, california. However,  this place will do."}
{"text":"Service is kinda impersonal. BUt the food is great. That is the reason why this place is usually packed for lunchtime. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I would not recommend coming to this place solely based on the service. The soup itself was great when they don't mess up your order that is. What I called to speak them about my to-go order being messed up the person I spoke to stated he would take care of it no problem. Then when I showed up he wants me to pay for another one with a promise that they will get it right. That makes no sense then argued that I read the menu wrong. I repeated my orders several times which you confirm by repeating back to me so I don't know how I can miss read the menu when it was a special order. To argue like that and not care about customer service just turns you off to a location. I should have been concern during my initial order when he cared more about being on his phone then dealing with the customer. I would not recommend coming to this place. 

 Funny how the person responding to my review wasn't even there. This has nothing to do with getting anything for free. This is the point I was trying to make they would rather argue with their customers than listen to them.  Terrible terrible terrible. If they would have stopped arguing and actually listen they would understand or hear the point that I was trying to make."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in portion size , left still hungry . Service ok. Taste ok not great."}
{"text":"second time coming to this location! always order a #27 with spring rolls. the pho is served fast. very delicious! 

customer service could be a little better. had to ask for extra lemons twice. 

would I come back? yeah because it's affordable."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Vietnamese Pho restaurants my whole life. Coming from LA, I tend to be a Pho snob but this place is soooo good. I got the one with everything rare. The soup is clean but full of flavor and the large bowl is PACKED with ingredients. Exactly what I'm looking for before a long ride back to LA and decently priced!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese cuisine, this restaurant is perfect and it's delicious and cheap. Growing up in Westminster Ca, I never knew how spoiled I was with so many authentic Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance. After moving to the East coast, I realized not all Vietnamese restaurants are the same. I have to say this place is on par with all the pho spots back home in Ca and is one of the best pho restaurants you can find in Vegas. I typically get the pho, but also recommend trying vermicelli, the rice dishes, and egg rolls. The decor isn't wonderful but this place is really just about the food. I usually get my order to go which will consist of a container of broth, and separate container with noodles, meat, and veggies. Just heat the broth and pour it in a bow with the noodles and meat. Presentation isn't the same as eating at the restaurant but the taste is the same. Overall, this is one of my favorite pho spots in Vegas and it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Lousy Customer service.Very slow. Gave us menus and did not come back for awhile. Not even waters for 10 minutes.Tables stink like an old dirty rag. I got the Chicken breast Pho and the broth was bland and tastless. Had to add a lot of Salt , pepper , and chil oil to give it flavor. The BBQ Pork roll was like a cold hot dog wrapped in a roll with a few veggies. They serve it with peanut sauce. Needs it to give it some taste. This was my second and last time here."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday with my family, and let me tell you Pho Saigon 8 has theeeeee BEST pho I've ever had in Las Vegas! Their pho broth is so tasty and it doesn't taste like water.. Unlike the other pho places I've been to. My brother isn't the biggest pho fan in the world, so he had their Korean BBQ plate & my daughter had their grilled chicken plate. Both came with a generous amount of rice, vegetables, & their nuoc cham sauce. I tried both and they were both sooo delicious! If I could order Pho, Korean BBQ, and Grilled Chicken.. I so would do it! 

Anyway, the place is nice & clean. It didn't take very long for us to get seated by the servers. The only reason why I didn't give this place five stars is because their service isn't all that great. I really appreciate servers who smile and are attentive, but you won't find that here :( I guess you can't pair up great food with great service.

Despite the whole crappy service thing, their food is on point so you'll definitely find me coming back here for more in the future :)"}
{"text":"So I had pho once in my life, it was seafood, I didn't like it and that was back in California. I, in my never ending quest to \"try new things\" went out for Vietnamese with my sister after coming up empty at Whole Foods. 

I've passed by this place a million times and have wanted to try it. Again, even if I don't like something the first time, I try to try it in a different preparation again at another time. We walked inside, it was nice, clean, and we were seated promptly. My sister decided she wasn't hungry and didn't want to try anything so she ordered a side of rice. I ordered a #73 (I have no idea what the real name was.) The description said it was spicy. The waitress told me it had pig's blood in it. Was I a little hesitant, yeah, but I ordered it anyway.

My sister's rice was delivered to our table in about 2 seconds, along with the mint and lettuce for my pho. About 5 minutes later, the soup came out. I was completely unfamiliar with the two gray black cubes of ??? and the white pate like half circle floating on the side. Apparently, according to the waitress, it was pig's blood sausage and another type of sausage. I had to skip the blood sausage. I couldn't bring myself to try it. The pork in it, well, I couldn't identify what part of the animal it was from. The fat was very rare. 

Was the soup spicy? No. I had to add a ton of siracha to my soup, along with the jalapenos. Would I go there again? Maybe, but I would for sure try something else. What I ordered was not something that had a lot of depth of flavor."}
{"text":"I only go here with my g/f when she is craving a beef noodle bowl. The service here is poor. Staff members never check up on us or refill our beverages after we've been served. Last time we were here, some of the staff were horseplaying right in front of the customers. The restaurant is very dirty too. I once sat down and shuffled my chair forward and my hand was covered in something slimy. Its disgusting smell forced me to head to the restroom and wash my hands repeatedly. I will take the advice of other reviewers and try out Lemongrass nearby."}
{"text":"This is a traditional Vietnamese restaurant where you'll need to seat yourself and pay at the register, so don't write a crappy review about waiting for your check or sitting at a dirty table. The food here is always fresh and consistently delicious. I suggest you try the crispy egg noodle plate along with a sweet iced coffee."}
{"text":"We were recommend to eat at this place by a local. The food rocked and was very good. Had the #1 and # 12, Eggrolls with the lettuce and herbs you dip in a great sauce and Pho soup that came in a  rich, full flavored, very tasty broth that made me think I was back in Vietnam.  Service was not the best as we were there in the end of a lunch rush but the food more then made up for that. They also let us order a 1/2 order of eggrolls when we were still hungry."}
{"text":"Flavor (Broth) was not the best. Cost was fine, but for a family of 5, they included an 18% tip onto the check. They also only accept cash, which didn't really matter to me, but service was so so. Been to much better."}
{"text":"one of the best pho places ever!  

we were in vegas last summer and really wanted some pho. so we went here and even though the place was really hot and crowded, the pho was delicious! so when we went back in december, i was afraid i was going to be let down (simply because I thought i over-hyped it to myself from the first time I went here).  BUT! i wasnt let down.  the pho was even better when its not blazing hot outside.  yum yum yum

the meat, rice plates, meatballs, noodles, etc. etc. are all great! the portion size is good for the price you pay and the place is very clean.  the service is quick and efficient.  

GO HERE IF YOURE IN VEGAS AND WANT PHO!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, every time i come and eat with my fambam Lucy knows my order like usual !! Great people and very friendly !!"}
{"text":"I came in around 2 for lunch on a Thursday and luckily it wasn't too busy so I was seated right away. I ordered the nem nuong spring rolls but they gave me the regular ones with shrimp instead. I was on a time limit so just ate it anyways. For my main entree I ordered the Saigon  banh canh  and it was just OK. I've had better and it was a lot of soup and not much meat. Also, no one followed up with me to see how everything was so customer service was lacking a bit."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas.  Don't have to go to California anymore.  
The Pho is phonomenal and the spring rolls are dynomite.  Ice French-pressed coffee with condensed milk will keep you high thoughout the day.  Nice Bun too."}
{"text":"when we saw that the noodle bar that the mandalay bay was charging upwards of $15 for a simple bowl of soup, we jumped in the car and drove a mere 10 minutes to spring valley's chinatown. 

good broth, served piping hot. good, springy noodles and fresh accompanying vegetables. and this place served cuts of beef of commendable quality in the soup. 

ca fe sua da was more potent than sweet (not necessarily a bad thing)."}
{"text":"It's probably the best pho in Las Vegas but of course it can't compared to pho in Little Saigon. The broth is flavorful but they don't give you alot of meat. I ordered pho dac biet (special pho)for  almost $9 but there is only few pieces of meat."}
{"text":"My daughter lv sugarcane shrimp. Bu bo hue was nicely done.  Not too sauty. Spice d just right. The bu thit nueng rice place was a nice complement.  Will return."}
{"text":"The pho is delicious, the place is causal and low key. ...The service, not so much. I waited at a table for a few mins, and one server kept avoiding eye contact. After I got my order, no one checked to see if I needed anything. And my dirty plates were not bussed and remained on the table until I left. Service 2.5 stars. Food 4 stars."}
{"text":"I go here all the time because:

1. It's always busy, that means food is good.

2. The bean sprouts and basil in the side are always fresh. The ingredients are fresh. Order something beside pho and taste the fresh ingredients. They don't have to put too much seasoning. \"FRESH!\"

3. They have the pickled jalapeño jar. I'm Thai, we Thais need something other than siracha. I only wish they had fresh ground chili. 

4. Service is simple, they just take order and you get up and pay at counter, I like that. So the food is not expensive and one does not need to leave a huge tip. 

I love this place. I seriously do. I just wish they had sandwiches too. Then my life would be complete."}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN TOWN PERIOD! 

I love this place for 10 years now! Rare and tendon! 
If in Chinatown this is the spot!"}
{"text":"The food is inexpensive and very tasty.  The service can be up or down depending on whatever I have had good service when it was busy and bad service when it was quiet(example we were escorted to a table when the restaurant was quiet, my wife asked to be seated at a different table, the host said it was dirty and left our water and menus at the table which we did not want to be seated and left.  We then waited for the table to be cleaned and then transferred our own water and menu.   I put up with the service because this is still my go to place for pho.   Except for one time when they placed our order to a different table by mistake our orders are usually served without a long wait.  If not for the spotty service I would give 4 stars.  Usually however they keep your water glass full(except once)"}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED. 
The pho was cold and they charged 15% for service without even notifying the customers!!! We didn't even know until the check came out. The ONLY thing the servers did was bring out water and our pho. NOTHING ELSE and they charged 15% for service. NEVER COMING BACK EVER!"}
{"text":"Woke up on a Friday morning and urgently needed a pho fix.

The special combo beef pho was a no-go.
The soup was really oily along with a herbal taste.
 However, they have fresh coconut juice and perfect Vietnamese coffee !!

Um, won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband is a Pho addict so about once a month I put on my sweet wife hat and we get pho. We used to live in Henderson and loved Pho Saigon 8, but now that we live on the other side of town we decided to try their Spring Mountain location. 

The decor is identical to the Henderson location, but the food is not nearly as good. The dining area is huge and the wait staff were friendly and even played peek-a-boo with our little one. We ordered the egg rolls and we both decided on grilled pork vermicelli. The egg rolls were OK, but the vinegar sauce on the side was lacking in flavor. The vermicelli was a biggest disappointment of the night. The pork didn't have the usual rich grilled flavor and the vegetables looked wilted and old. I didn't touch the lettuce and scooted the limp carrots to the side of my bowl. The noodles seemed old and were cold and lifeless. The flavors were muddled, not the bright and vibrant dish I was hoping to receive. We also shared a thai tea which tasted off too. I took a couple of sips and decided I was done.  

We definitely won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"One of the better pho restaurants in Las Vegas.  Pho is tasty with excellent broth.  I had the BBQ pork chops and fried egg combo and really liked the flavor of the pork, however, the chop was so thinly sliced I was disappointed with the portion.  The fried fish balls and egg rolls were excellent.  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Always great pho soup and usually pretty good service from the staff. Love coming here for lunch with Co workers and friends. Ordering take out for lunch is a breeze too as they package everything up neatly for you in alittle pho kit."}
{"text":"Tried Pho for the first time from here. Delish! So good my boyfriend stole my left overs. Really big portions which is awesome."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times. More so on my lunch break. 
They prepare  everything fresh, it was always hot when I came to pick it up.

 I have tried the spring rolls. Very good. Fresh shrimp, good peanut sauce.
Also I have tired the egg rolls,they are the small ones minimally filled but have an great inside! I like how with the order you get a big bag of lettuce and things. The sauce for the rolls is also very good.

I should have tried more and gone more often, maybe I will. 
But from what I did have , it was always good!"}
{"text":"Overall: Pho Saigon 8 disappoints in making its namesake dish, but the Hu Tieu was pretty dang good. It might be my regular for that dish, but I'll have to continue looking for a pho restaurant.

Food: 3

Pho Chin (Cooked Brisket): The broth lacked the intense umaminess from beef bones, but it was clear and not too sweet. However, the brisket was completely dry and tasteless.

Hu Tieu My Tho Kho: Surprisingly, this dish was good. The sauce was well balanced and flavorful. There was plenty of sautéed ground pork and offals, and the shrimps were a good size. They aren't too consistent on the offals as one bowl had almost all heart while the other had a mix of heart and liver. Make sure to ask for the hu tieu giay!

Service: 3

We didn't have too many interactions with the waiters outside of ordering and asking for a few extra things.

As a California native from Little Saigon, I'm used to ordering in Vietnamese in Vietnamese restaurants. However, I'm not sure if all the waiters here speak Vietnamese fluently because our waiter seemed to have a hard time understanding my order.

Ambiance: 4

Pho Saigon 8 is a small restaurant, so the tables are kind of close together. But it's decently clean and cool."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day since I was on this side of town. I came with a bunch of friends and we got seated immediately. 

I ordered a small pho with brisket & beef balls. My friends got a large pho (#18) & egg rolls. We got our rolls first and without really looking at the menu we assumed that spring rolls were the fried rolls, since a lot of Vietnamese places call spring rolls egg rolls & the uncooked rolls summer rolls. But I guess every Vietnamese place differs? (Kinda confusing tho :( ) we told them that we wanted the fried ones so they had to go back & make our order. At first they told us to just take it & eat them since we ordered it but why take something we won't eat right? The pho on the other hand was good. It had a lot of green onions which I personally like & the broth was flavorful. But my friends & I felt like the only difference with the large was more soup and a bit more meat. They didn't have a lot of noodles to accommodate the meat and I usually like that. My pho had a lot of noodles but not enough meat. I had about 4 beef balls cut in half (2 full size beef balls) & 4 pieces of brisket. I was left with a lot of noodles leftover. Pho 8/10 The egg rolls was good tho! 10/10

Customer service was decent. I feel like at a lot of Asian places customer service is just whatever. Not the friendliest but also not the meanest. A guy always came to refilled our water so +1 for them! 

Overall, will come back here again to eat their pho! Especially because of th broth & how fast it was to receive your order."}
{"text":"There must be a 1000 Pho joints in Vegas, this one is the BEST!

And they have so much more than pho: wonderful summer rolls, cold noodle bun and about another 500 wonderful menu items of fresh, excellently prepared and presented Vietnamese food. Did I say everything there is very FRESH? I hope I mentioned that everything there is very FRESH, because everything there is very FRESH:-) Wonderful food, generous portions and excellent service at very reasonable prices. What else do you want? The only folks I trust for my pho. You won't be disappointed. I promise!"}
{"text":"Always a consistent meal over the last 14 years I have been coming here. Love the egg rolls to start and #25. Both locations consistent for me!"}
{"text":"I know what I am getting every time I go.  I used to frequent the Spring Mountain location for like 10 years.  This one is much more convenient off the 215.  I even go alone if I am in the mood for Pho!"}
{"text":"best pho in vegas! 

think of this place as the GOLDEN DELI of vegas! hahahah all you SGV people kno what im talking about.

this place is really good, always consistent, clean and super helpful. they dont charge you for tea (hate it when places do that) and they are super good about bringing you extra stuff like limes ect.

i come here all the time, its a little further from the strip than other places, but it is worth the drive, you will never be disapointed. I DO NOT DARE EAT PHO ANYWHERE ELSE (except maybe hue thai) lol Rice plates are good here and other noodle dishes too."}
{"text":"I have a resolution to everyone's service complaints!! Order to go!

I placed an order for pickup after work... I've never done this with pho before, so when I went to pick up my ONE order of #11, pho tai, I was surprised to look like I ordered for an entire family! 

I got home, unwrapped my goods.... it was just like I was at the restaurant, in my own home:]. Everything that they would serve you was included: all the leafy goodness (still not sure what all of it is), cilantro and chives, LOTS of noodles, and a generous amount of  RAW thin slices of beef. This was all neatly organized in a generic Styrofoam to-go box.  Hoisin sauce and red pepper sauce were also packed into my belongings. Also, a large Styrofoam cup/bowl(?) of the beef broth. The broth was still piping hot. It cooked my beef slices just as I wanted, instantly. Although I did make the mistake of keeping the lid off, so it cooled down pretty quickly and didn't cook the beef so well for my second portion. 

Absolutely delicious. 

I prepared it all just how I would want it.. and even came back for seconds. I of course didn't waste all the meat, but I couldn't finish the noodles. 

It seems that people really knock the ratings down on this place because of the service... so may I recommend take out?? Try it again yallllll"}
{"text":"This Pho place is my top 2 pho places in Vegas and you don't know how excited I am that there is a new location and that it is closer to my home than going to the one located on Spring Mountain in Chinatown. They have great tasting broths and other options for you non soup people out there. I have pretty picky standards with pho broths as I had an awesome place I used to go too back home in Hawaii. 

But all I know it's yummy pho, good apps and south of 215. It is good for all us people who live south of the 215 and close to blue diamond. YUM."}
{"text":"Yummy Pho for dinner is always yummy and healthy, no meat just noodle and soup with lots off green onions"}
{"text":"The best part about this place is that they give you complimentary hot tea. Otherwise, their broth is bland and they barely gave me any tendon pieces. Price wise they're average, about $8 for a small. Gonna keep looking for something better."}
{"text":"Food tasted the same as the spring mountain location which was great! Server was great and friendly. The cashier should quit because he definitely has no personality nor customer service skills lol. Grumpy people should stay at home haha."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, we were told to seat ourselves at a table that was still dirty. The person that cleaned it didn't do such a hot job and never stocked the soup spoons or chopsticks. When we were seated the waitress came and took our order and within 5 minutes we had our pho. The pho was delicious, I can't complain about that but the service was awful. No one came to check on us throughout our meal, no one came to fill up our drinks or even give us napkins. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get someone's attention, when the guy came over I asked for two to-go containers and the check, the guy said ok and disappeared. Just to see him helping others and ignoring us....it was an additional 20 minutes until the waitress who helped us in the beginning came back and checked on us!!! Seriously!? She asked if we wanted water and if we were okay, an hour after she took our order...it's not a big place, it was a normal busy but come on! It's sad cause the food was good but customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"quick helpful service. the food was sooooo amazing. The broth is so delicious, meat is so soft and juicy, both the egg and rice noodles are delicious. they have more besides pho and it is all amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing I hate more then being serviced after people who were seated after me. Unorganized and annoying. I ordered a coffee...never got it and they still tried to charge me for it. Seriously?!!! Gave me the wrong dish...they claim it's what I ordered. Will never be back. I'll be sure to let as many people know not to dine at this so called restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was our every Monday and Tuesday breakfast/brunch restaurant. Since they started going late night, they have been producing horrible food. My pho had so much oil in it that taking a bite was like slathering too much lip balm on your lips!!! Had them change it out, they poured out the soup and put new soup, didn't change out the noodles! Oil sticks to the noodles!! I use to reccomend them to others but I don't want anyone to experience what I did. Some days their good, some days, like today... Their horrible!!! Still got charged for it!!"}
{"text":"Great, lunch or dinner. Comfortable room with minimal decor or distractions.  Rarely full so easy to bring families or groups without advance planning; it seems people don't know about the great food here. Lunch specials until 2pm and great selections on the menu. Best meal for the value."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was way better than expected. The normal place I go to rates crap compared to Pho Saigon 8. No wonder it's always packed!"}
{"text":"This place has really good pho.  Im def qualified to say if its bad or not. Its def high quality and  somewhat healthy. 

The owners  are great and the atmosphere is really good.  I can def say i was pleased with the service. 

Do i think the food here is good? Pho... getto bout it. I wish this place was open 
twenty pho seven"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  Who built this location? Looks nicer than any restaurant ive seen off of the strip. The contractor must of been really amazing.  

The food is so delicious and fresh. More importantly, the owners are really good people. Especially, the mother who is actually the boss.

Ill come here any day of the week..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for quite a while and the soup is good. I find that sometimes the waiters are jerks ... And they are not honest or they don't understand you! I ordered a small bowl of soup today and got a small soup ... I have been going there long enough to tell the difference (even though sometimes it is hard to tell). When I walked up to the register the guy charged me for a large one ... After arguing with him as to what I ordered and what I got, he took two steps to the side checked my table and said yeah that's a big one ... I walked back there and took a big one from another table and put it next to it, he still charged me for a big one. It is a dollar, I don't want to argue with stupid people but I won't go there again. Way to go playing with a customer that was there at least once a week ! Finding another place right now ..."}
{"text":"We sat down and were asked 7 times if we were ready to order. I have eaten there before so was prepared but the GF and her daughter were studying the menu and it was clear they werent readt. They felt rushed and offended.

The food was top notch and was what we expected. Im assuming they served me first as I was the oldest male at the table but they made the GF and the daughter wait 10mins for their food. 

They could have served me first and then the girls but to make them wait that long seemed out of place.

We then asked for take home boxes and the server didnt want us mixing our food. Saying that would ruin everything. 

I thought it was funny but the GF said I paid for the meal and I will do with it what I want and it freaked him out.

Outside of the cultural differences it was a good experience."}
{"text":"this place is mediocre at best, nothing surpasses the Pho in \"little Saigon.\"

I had the Tai, Nam, Gan small bowl (same thing I get everywhere) &&had only about 2 pieces of each type of meat in my bowl. 

We also ordered BBQ Pork Chops to go to eat with vermicelli at home, but word to the wise, DO NOT order it separately, you might as well get it with rice there for the extra 2bucks, since it came out to about $5/piece."}
{"text":"Okay, I have absolutely no problem giving this place 5 stars. The Pho is amazing! I like my soup simple. Just noodles in chicken broth. I HIGHLY recommend the Lemongrass Beef!! I believe it's #56. I'll have to update next time I'm there. 
If you're looking for some great Vietnamese food, it's here. 
Want a lot of choices on the menu? Then this is a great place. 
One of my favorite sides is the egg fried rice. It's just good. There isn't even salt on the table. The cooks know that they season their food to perfection. 
I have to be honest, I'm a little put off by the picture of the pig hanging in the kitchen. I suppose having it refrigerated would be way more comforting. 
BONUS: There is a bottle of sriracha at every table. (~: Love that."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good. I love this place. The pho is seriously the best. Please give this place a try. The lemon grass beef is awesome (#56). Just eat it.
Onto the pho...... if you've come here and reviewed it as \"not tasty\" or \"tasteless\" then come on back and throw some sriracha in your soup. It's not needed though. The soup is fantastic. 
If you want some damn good Vietnamese food, this is the place. 
One last thing.... ALWAYS tip your server. Please. 
Understand that you're walking into a restaurant that serves food from a different culture. 
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here, but today after I ate a couple pieces of my chicken from my dark meat chicken pho,and I told the waitress the soup was very salty, can I cxl it if it's possible, and she said\"your ordered it and you already eat it, can't cxl it\" really?????? She didn't even offer me and see if I want to exchange something else, what kind of service is that? Sometimes a good reputation and service is more important than the money !!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pho restaurants I ever tried. I traveled nationwide to find a good pho restaurant. & this is the first time I finally found one. 

This is how EXCELLENT pho supposed to be: 
1. Large bowl with enough noodles, & enough amount of meats. 
2. Broth is correct!!!! Not diluted like the other bad pho restaurants I've tried & does not taste like Hu Tieu. The spicing is correct: I scent cowbone, star anise, and lots of ginger and roast onions in that broth; THAT'S HOW CORRECT PHO SUPPOSE TO TASTE LIKE. 
3. Your server also ask us to include a separate small plate of onions soaked in vinegar, & a small bowl of liquid fat. THAT'S ALSO HOW CORRECT & TRADITIONAL VIETNAMESE PHO SUPPOSED TO BE!!!! EXCELLENT!!!! 
4. Your Com Tam plate is also excellent. Almost to compete against Com Tam Thuan Kieu. 
5. Cha Gio (egg rolls) also good; very crispy & well spiced. 

But this is what I like most about your restaurant: 
When my buddy orders Com Tam while I order Pho Dac Biet, technically, Com Tam served a bit slow. But here, the Com Tam is served to the table at the same time with the Pho Dac Biet. EXCELLENT GUYS!!!! THAT'S HOW IT SUPPOSED TO BE!!!! All foods should come out all at once!!!! Not like other bad pho restaurants where one person receive the pho, but the one who orders the Com Tam has to wait while their buddy is finishing their plate. Overall, good service. 

So far, I have nothing bad to comment you. 

I will be back to your restaurant someday when I'm in town. I'm hoping you keep it up with the good work like you did in my last visit. 

Overall: 5/5 stars for you. Keep up the good work Pho Saigon 8 of Spring Mountain Rd."}
{"text":"Came for good food, found out there's bug in soup!!!! I'm mortified and server asked if I want another one? I said from the same kitchen? No! Got up to leave and cashier told me I owe $20, I said why am I paying for food I didn't eat? There's bug in my food!!!  Don't go! Health warning!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend to eat a few weeks ago. The only other time I've been here is to pick up a to go order. 

Ok let's talk about ambience... it's a typical Vietnamese pho joint which gets busy at times! Ive ordered a couple of food items which wasn't so tasty but there are also ones I do enjoy. Such as the banh cuon its tasty but i wish their servings is a big bigger in size. If you order that alone you won't be full. The pho here is pretty good. The soda chanh muoi is kinda sweet but if you let them know they will adjust it to make it taste better for you. 

The service at this location varies depending on who you get as a server... some are good and some aren't. 

Overall this place is a typical vietnamese pho joint where you can go for some tasty foods... I will come back again.. but this place is nothing to rave about. Its average viet food."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant can compare to Bay Area's Vietnamese restaurant. I m not saying that Bay Area has the best restaurants but since I m from the bay area that's all I can compare. Their Soup base taste very good. I wouldn't mind going there when I visit Vegas again. Their price is not expensive at all."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it is close to my house, but I was very disappointed in the Pho Ga (chicken pho). The broth was suuuper weak, no flavor at all. I guess I'll have to trek my way to China Town to get some decent pho because I wouldn't waste my money on this place again."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in town.

I've dined in just about every location on Spring Mountain Rd., and this is the place I've been coming to for the past year or two. It is often packed with people throughout the day, even towards the late night. 

- Clean, flavorful broth. 
- Good portions for a good price.
- Great selection of food items, roughly over 100 different choices.
- Favorites are \"everything-pho\", Bun Bo Hue, and the Fried Spring Rolls. 
- Service is better than most for asian establishments, they are quick and attentive, but few do not speak english.
- Restaurant is clean and nicely maintained.

Overall, a great place at a great price."}
{"text":"Came by this place on a cold night, so I was looking for some hot pho and this was the spot my friend recommended. I was cold and starving and our server was on it! She hooked us up with hot water, instead of the cold variety and brought our food out in like 10 seconds flat! I ordered a #16, which was different cuts of beef with some soft tendon and nice noodles and broth. It was a yummy not too oily basic broth and the noodles were just the right texture. The meat didn't taste like leftover bits, which was nice and the price was just right! I think it was just under $9 which included tip! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with several co-workers. The weather is cold and what better time than that to get some pho. We came around noon since my coworker mentioned they get pretty busy. 

The decor is nice and they keep the place pretty clean. I wasn't in a soup eating mood, so I decided on a vermicelli bowl. My other coworker ordered some eggrolls to share and they were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but they had a nice crunch. My vermicelli bowl was a little lackluster. I usually enjoy all the nice crunchy vegetables that are included and this one just included a few leaves of lettuce and some sprouts. Definitely not what I had hope for. The pork and shrimp were ok, but definitely not one of best bowls I've encountered. 

Since they are the closest pho place to work, I'll probably give them another shot, but I'll try their pho next time. The prices are a little on the high side, but I guess that's pretty typical for the Henderson area. For now, I can't give them much beyond three stars."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Las Vegas hands down.  It's all about the broth, and their broth is amazing.  I don't really expect fabulous service at a Vietnamese restaurant.  I have never gotten it.  But I couldn't care less!I still go for the soup.  And the egg rolls."}
{"text":"Overpriced. And HORRIBLE customer service. Food was cold and so plain. We asked them to fix it or at least side of sauce and they refused. They said you get what you order. Don't come here. Spend the money and go somewhere else or with better service!"}
{"text":"seriously delicious and service was really great!!!! half off appetizers for happy hour!! bun cha hanoi and nem nuong did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Heard the Pho was good so went to try it.  They do have longevity as I ate here over a decsde ago and thought i better try it agsin.  Extremely hard time ordering due to my lack of Vietnamese but that's fine my rating is based purely on taste.  Nothing special at all and far from as good as a few other of my goto Pho places.  Unfortunately not good enough to return.  Upon leaving I noticed a table that ordered egg rolls and they looked fantastic."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Las Vegas, and after a few bad experiences at other pho restaurants- I am happy to announce that we finally found our spot.  (We moved from LA where we made the 1 hour trek in traffic to the \"Golden Deli\" at least twice a month).  Pho Saigon 8 is only 15 minutes from our new home, so it already gets a star in our book.  The ambience is nice, the waiters are friendly, the restaurant is clean, prices are reasonable, it is child-friendly, and most important- the food is delicious.  

We have already come back 4 times (once a week)- and have had positive experiences every time."}
{"text":"Don't come to this place . Is the This get lucky cause on yelp cant have -. They have a very rude service.  and my order is missing the beef too. When I ask for a small bowl of soup. The \"owner\" refused it don't understand how can they still in business."}
{"text":"This is my go-to pho restaurant here in Henderson (for the record, I have not yet tried Pho Mai Lan down the street). As a Vietnamese girl who grew up in Orange County (the largest congregation of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam), I can only give it 3 stars. 

The food is \"good enough\" to satisfy my cravings, but nowhere near the best or even mediocre Vietnamese food in SoCal. They have a really great variety so I can get pretty much anything I'm craving, and their Vietnamese iced coffee is really good (and properly served with a drip thing over a mug with condensed milk and a cup of ice). 

Yeah, the staff isn't super friendly, but that's how Vietnamese restaurants are, in my experience. They hussle you in and out and don't really come back to check on you - pretty standard. However, the one thing that's incredibly annoying is that they insist you order by the menu item # and when the food comes out, they say the menu item #. I have terrible memory, so I can never remember what number I ordered (I remember the name in Vietnamese because it's usually a staple that I order frequently).  

They are really good about splitting the bill by item / person if you come here in groups as my friends and I frequently do. You just pay at the front and tell them what number dish you had. No credit cards under $10."}
{"text":"The vegetable noodle soup had NO flavor was really bland and the beef broth had a very funky smell. The pork egg rolls were average and the paper wrap rolls had brown lettuce and were very bland with no flavor as well. They also had lunch meat turkey in the wrap which I have never seen before. Was not very impressed , will not be re-ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Thinking that Las Vegas has become a place for chinese people to migrate, I definitely thought Vietnamese HAS TO GOOD, indeed!

Pho was so gooood!! Thanks fellow yelpers, this is a great place!! I loved it!  We ordered the summer rolls, but I don't know why the server got confused with spring rolls... but anyway they were SO good!  Hers were SUPER fresh, mint, thai basil.  Also ordered Banx Xeo (crepe with shrimp, bean sprout and veggies i.e. carrot and turnip that has been seasoned ahead) this dish came with mint, thai basil, thai shiso (not sure if it's called like that but it does taste like japanese shiso!)

And of course the Pho was GREAT!! sweet broth, just perfect for a cold night!  It did strike me as interesting that there was no fish sauce on the table.. not that the broth needs it, but oh... well just an observation.  Many people were eating here for dinner, majority asians but some westerners as well.  The menu is HUGE, we did not get a chance to order dessert it was too much food, good food!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Pho in Vegas! 

I usually get the chicken pho, but switched it up to tofu recently. Either one is just as good. Fresh chili paste on tap is always a winner for me and the fresh spring rolls are awesome as well. 

Service isn't always the greatest, but I've seen improvement. A bit crowded, but not that big of a deal. There's something about being surrounded by others that just want to enjoy a warm bowl of soup, quite homey. 

I'll continue to come here for my Pho fix. I'm not a fan of experimenting once I'm convinced I have found the best!!"}
