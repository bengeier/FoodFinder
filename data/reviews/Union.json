{"text":"My boyfriend and I both ordered ribs and they were AMAZING. Fantastic explosions of exquisite seasoning brought the wonderful flavours of the ribs and greens directly to our taste buds. IMO the fries were not good at all, but hopefully Union go for something other than the string cut fries someday.  In any case, the atmosphere was very intimate and comfortable, the wait staff were super nice, the location is awesome. Had a great overall experience. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great vibe at Union. Patio in the back is amazing. Food was good. I had one of the sandwiches and it was fabulous. Hubby had the hamburger which was im good but a bit too sweet. Overall, good experience and would return for some drinks and food in the patio."}
{"text":"Love it, neighbourhood favourite. Farm to table, their fish is always fresh and delicious.  Patio is out back, wonderful in summer."}
{"text":"The food is like a mouth-gasm.  Everything here is fresh, locally sourced, and delish!  The menu has some amazing regulars and new dishes that pop up from time to time.  They can be a little short staffed, but the sometimes slow service is worth the wait. The food is just plain awesome.  Recommend the burger on the coco bun, the sticky ribs, the elk sliders, and the polenta!   Avoid sitting at the kitchen bar, it's a bit short on knee room and a little uncomfy."}
{"text":"I've been to Union twice over the past 2 months, once for lunch and once for brunch. I really like this place and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something a little different than the standard brunch options.   What I like most is that the fact that their menu changes on a daily basis depending on what is available from local farmers and partners. These menu changes keeps things interesting and makes me coming back to see what's new.   I've had the elk sliders, which are really tasty but really an appetizer portion, the union burger is also great. For brunch I had the lobster, crab and trout fritata and I've also had the BBQ ribs eggs benedict - which is my favourite so far.   The coffee and lattes are good and the service is pleasant and attentive.  Prices are average to slightly higher but well worth it for the food and t support local restaurants and farmers.  Definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yuck!!  This place was terrible!!!!!  We had a reservation for 9pm and were not seated until past 9:30pm with no apology or compensation. Food was mediocre and overpriced. If I'm going to spend $30 on  my main, I can think of MUCH better places to go. Terrible!!!!  I think people are more excited about being in trendy Ossington than realizing their dinner is not good!!!!!  Oh, never again!!!!  No thank you!!!!  If I'd spent $9 on my crappy dinner, I'd still be annoyed."}
{"text":"Fabulous.  I think the menu changes everyday, but they seem to have a few go-to items on the menu. The sticky ribs are to die for. Reservations highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto, hands down. Service, food, drinks, and atmosphere are always impeccable but in a low key way.   Good place to go with a few friends or a date, or to cozy up to the bar solo.  A little pricey but absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience and service.  Try the charcuterie to start.  As Nicole M. mentioned, the ribs are unbelievable, as are the potatoes that the table is given to share family style."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. The cocktail menu listed all the classics and some creative concoctions, which is always appreciated. He went with his stand-by, Old Fashioned (Bourbon, Orange Simple Syrup and House Bitters), while I tried the Margery (Tequila, Peach, Lime, Rhubarb Bitters, Grand Marnier, Salt Rim).  While I normally cringe at even the smell of his Old Fashioned, this one had enough citrus flavour to mask the normally unyielding bourbon.  Either I liked it, or I'm just becoming desensitized to straight liquor. Whichever, the drink was a winner. I wasn't as big a fan of my cocktail, which I thought lacked any of the aforementioned fruit flavour.  I actually hardly even tasted any lime amidst all that salt and the bitters. Let's move onto food, though. In conversation with the chef, we made a few selections and decided to share.  Steak Tartar (Sample) His first recommendation was the steak tartar.  I explained I wasn't incredibly enthusiastic about tartar normally but like all great chefs, this one seemed to be on a mission to convert me, and offered us a (generous) sample to try.  Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly), it was lovely. Deliciously fresh, perfectly seasoned with a pleasant texture to complement buttery grilled bread. I would feel confident ordering this one myself next time.  Candy Cane Beets & Salt Baked Celeriac with red fife, sweet mustard and dill sauce A generous salad of root vegetables that were beautifully cooked and seasoned.  While they were cooked without colour or caramelization, the vegetables offered a subtle sweetness and supple texture that was nicely balanced by the crunchy bitter radicchio. The sauce was creamy but not heavy, with a mild heat and a good level of fresh herbacious flavour. A beautiful autumn starter.  Elk Sliders, with mirin galangal glaze and pickle on challah A stark contrast from the aforementioned appetizer, this was rich, playful, and sinfully addictive.  The sliders were tender, moist and pink, sitting atop a buttery piece of rich egg bread ready to sop up all of its juices. The sweet and sticky glaze was almost like maple syrup, with a more complex savoury note.  We basically had to refrain ourselves from swiping our fingers across the plate to capture it all. Topped off with a little dollop of spiced mayo and a couple crunchy pickle chips- this was the winner of the night.  Rabbit Dijonaise with puy lentils, sauerkraut and broccolini Watching all those little bunnies barrel through the obstacle course all day at the fair obviously didn't stop me from ordering this dish, especially after the chef recommended it to us.  The rabbit itself was generously portioned and seasoned nicely, but a little bit dry in some of the thinner pieces.  Having said that, the sauce was luscious, with a pleasant level of richness and pungent mustard flavour and the sauerkraut was addictive. While I'm not usually a huge fan of puy lentils, these one's were cooked nicely and definitely complemented the sauce well.    Sticky Ribs charcoal smoked and braised back ribs in home made BBQ sauce   Amazing. I had heard about these ribs and was looking forward to giving them a try, and they were incredibly good.  They were meltingly tender, without a single trace of grizzle or gelatinized fat, and the sauce was thick and fruity, with a nice balance of sweet and tart flavours.  Side of frites (to accompany the ribs) An unexpected (the menu didn't list that the frites accompanied the ribs) and generous portion.  They were super crispy and golden brown, but lacked a nice pinch of sea salt.  Probably for the better that they were low on seasoning, though, or else I might have really overindulged.    Sticky Ginger Cake with Caramel Ice Cream I had a hard time trying to decide which dessert I wanted, because almost all of the offerings were some of my favourite foods (caramel cheesecake, banana bread pudding, pecan pie).  Alas, with the server's recommendation, I opted for the sticky ginger cake (a more spicy version of my beloved Sticky Toffee Pudding).  The cake originally was to come with vanilla ice cream, but I requested the caramel off the menu (despite the chef's best attempts to give it to me on the side).  The cake was incredibly moist, with a delicate level of heat.  While it may have seemed like a lot of sweet, caramelized sugary flavours going on (this was the chef's concern with me adding the caramel ice cream), it was actually surprisingly satisfying.  This ice cream was more of the burnt caramel variety, with a mildly bitter flavour to temper the more cloying caramel sauce on top.  A solid dessert, and a nice rendition of my favourite British dessert. ..... So for the 3 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 mains and a dessert, the bill came to about $160 including tax and tip- pretty reasonable for the substantial portions and quality.  We both enjoyed our nig"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great meal with friends, go here. The food is consistently amazing and the staff are fantastic. This place is a Toronto gem. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this little spot. We always meet great people at the bar while we drool over the dishes being prepared. We have never been disappointed. The food is on the heavy side so great if you're quite hungry. Share something of you aren't. Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I'm giving this three stars because when we first came here, the service was great (about four and a half stars), the food even better, but the blond hostess had such a sour face, it was quite unpleasant. As the first person you see is the host/ess, the tone of the customer's experience is set from the start. Ours was not a good start. The second time, we sat at the bar, and I saw her drop something on the bar floor, right in front of us; she didn't pick it up for over 5 minutes, and when she finally did, she put it back on the jar without washing it. The bartender was busy making our drinks, so he asked her to make the drink she needed, as it was a very simple one to make. But wow, that was a dirty floor, so to conclude, we wouldn't go there again, unless we see that she is not working there when we go back. They need to know that customers have eyes, and we are aware if a place is clean, if their hygiene practices are enforced/ practiced. That hostess/ staff, needs to be aware that if you drop something, especially in front of a customer, wash-it before putting the item back on, or throw it in the garbage. And as a hostess, how about you start with a \"hello\" and a smile."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places to eat brunch and dinner.  Food is as fresh as it can get.  And you can taste it! Combinations are great. Had Steak Hash, Maple Bread pudding Wife had Swiss train ride (Croque Madame)  Unbelievably tasty , good prices,  service was good. atmosphere also was one of the better ones in the Ossington strip.  Smaller restaurant as you will be rubbing elbows with your neighbours, but it just allows you to look at their food too, if you ordered something different!  Make friends and share I say!  It's my go to place on Ossington even with the many up and coming restaurants flocking to that strip!"}
{"text":"We visited Union on last night (Tuesday) and I couldn't have been more delighted! Everything was absolutely delicious, and we had a great time. They have recently started opening on Tuesday nights, only for dinner (starting at 6pm). On Tuesdays they serve $10 small plates, which is kind of like tapas--they are intended to be shared. This is a good idea and it allows you to taste a little bit of many parts of the menu. My boyfriend and I each ordered 2 plates: Ratatouille, Lamb, Octopus Salad, and the Sticky Ribs. Everything was delicious... especially the sticky ribs. If you decide to come here do not miss out on these! They are to die for (thanks to the chef, our friend Jules!) This ended up being just the right amount of food to have and share, perhaps we could have ordered one more plate."}
{"text":"I was wandering around Ossington when a huge rainstorm hit and was lucky enough to nab the last table at Union. The roast chicken was amazing, the steak tartare was perfect and the beer was cold. The waitress was really friendly and the atmosphere was phenomenal. Definitely a great spot to eat."}
{"text":"We were craving dessert after dinner just up the street, so we popped in and asked if we could just gets sweets and coffee.  They seated us at the counter looking out the front window, a lovely place to sit for a short stay.  It looks like the dessert menu changes often (the version we saw isn't the same one on the website right now).  We ordered the raisin bread pudding--very rich, with a brûlée top and caramel ice cream on the side--and the frangipane, a dense, not-too-sweet almond cake served with blueberry sauce and barely sweetened whipped cream.  The two desserts balanced each other really nicely."}
{"text":"We love the concept of farm fresh foods being served exclusively, so we were pretty excited about checking out Union. Being placed at the dining bar by the kitchen was fun as you could watch the chefs in action. The overall atmosphere of the place was a lot more casual then I was expecting.   I just wish the food delivered as well as it should have. Perhaps our expectations had been drawn high when we heard about the concept, saw the prices and watched the chefs at work.  The best dish of the night was the skate. The skin was crisp and the fish tender. Overall the elements on the plate worked so well together and the meal just tasted light and refreshing.   On the other hand, the stick ribs felt heavy and the sauce was far too sweet to really enjoy it.   The mussels were ok. They had a bit of grit to them and the sauce had a slightly strange aftertaste to me.   Dessert was a delicious ginger (or toffee?) cake. Moist and gooey.   All in all just ok. If you're charging this much for food every dish needs to deliver. I can't eat a dish thinking I can make something similar, better at home."}
{"text":"What a sad sad night my evening at Union turned out to be, and it had started with such high hopes.   I'd called their reservation number and left a voicemail with my preferred time for dining (10pm - I like eating late, what of it).  But my weakness with the medium of voicemail reared it's ugly head and I didn't leave a phone number for the staff to return my call.  Fortunately, a kind heart *69'd my ass (or did some hard creeping) and found my number and let me know that they'd be happy to accomodate my request, and if I'd rather come for 9:30pm-9:45pm there would be lots of room as a large group would be leaving at said time.   So... I started getting hungry and my partner-in-dining and I ventured over for 9:50pm.  When we arrived the staff seemed somewhat confused...lovely.  We stalked a staff member down and told them our name for the reservation and they told us it would just be a minute for our table.  Luckily it was only a moment later for our table... but I would have waited longer.. we were placed at an obvious table for four, but squished in a back corner where it was difficult for staff to speak to us and our neighbours had no choice but to listen in on our conversation.  Lest you think I'm an anti-communal table fiend, I'm not, I love Oddfellows for example.  But when you sit me at a FAUX table for two, that pisses me off.   Things went from bad to worse... the group that was supposed to leave at 9:30pm apparently showed up VERY late and was overwhelming the staff with their seperate bills and appetizers and main orders.  Now I understand the frustration with big picky groups, but it doesn't excuse forgetting about diners. We waited ages for water, had a mis-mash of servers, and NO apologies for the long wait times for food/service/drinks.  We were continually given the excuse \"oh this group is just too much\" (the jersey shore crowd was a little over the top, but I wasn't letting them ruin my night.  Union's staff was doing that all on their own).   Our neighbours actually commented to us on how we should be upset and that this was insane.  While they'd been able to drink their way through the frustrations, our waiter(s) didn't appear often enough to indulge in more libations.  Sadly.   But on to the food - delicious.  The saving grace.  The beef carpaccio was phenomenal, and the rabbit stew was indulgent without feeling heavy.   Will I return? VERY doubtful.  Next time I'll stick with Delux and actually enjoy my evening."}
{"text":"I've only gone here for drinks. It's a destination place on Ossington. There is a small bar, good place to go before or after dinner. The bartenders certainly know how to make a good drink here. Just don't sit in front of the beer spouts, they are sometimes known to unsuspectingly spew beer onto customers when they are at the end of their keg."}
{"text":"Following on with my wine bar tour in Toronto, Union 72 was next on the hitlist, with 9 local Canadian wines available by the glass, I tried 4 of them while there.  I was given a seat at the bar by the front window and ordered the Organic greens, potato rosti, chevre and Union smoked bacon to start. The bacon gave the dish a delicious punch to compliment the creamy goats cheese and salad vinaigrette. The warm, crisp potato rosti was very pleasant as well.  For the main course, I had the Steak hachette. This was a simple dish in some ways, there are 4-5 components and nothing overly flashy technique wise, but it tasted great, the beef was seared nicely and rare on the inside then the pinch of habanero salsa on the side had an excellent kick to it.  Overall the experience at Union 72 was very good, the food was well executed and the flavours were allowed to shine through, and the wines were for the most part very good, with the Fielding Pinot Gris one of the highlights of the 20+ wines tasted while in Canada."}
{"text":"Food is good here but service is terrible. Hipster-wanna-be-wait staff was negligent on how long we waited for breakfast (40 mins) and we ordered simple eggs Benny and croque madam. Usually by the time you finish your coffee, your food should arrive....so not the case for us. Others ordered after us and got there food in less than 20 mins. We asked for the bill 3 times and after waiting for 10mins, we got up to just pay at the register, and one of the wait staff said she can bring the machine to us - I almost lost my cool on her. What the F pretentious a$$e$! No apology, no care or concerns, won't go back, the experience sucked!!!"}
{"text":"Just a beautiful,bustling place on Ossington.  The service was really friendly and solid which was a bit of a surprise given how busy they were.  The menu was a bit dull and I was not overly excited about the entrees but they turned out really great.  Agree with the review by MJ on the Elk Sliders - I was excited for them and they did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"4/5! Highly recommend the Elk sliders. Will definitely go back to try the other dishes on the menu. Cute place and great location."}
{"text":"Ambience was nice and service was excellent. I can see potential.   Wine is terribly overpriced; ONE glass of prosecco for 12 bucks, come on, and wine for 11??? It's not that good a selection. How am I ever going to get in the mood??? (Suggestion: have a cocktail beforehand; more bang for the buck).   My pork chop was tough to chew. The fries were good but they should not be served in the same bowl as the potatoes with yoghurt dressing, they get all mushy; and the aioli on top was too much. Perhaps, serve it on the side?  SO had a salad (with roesti) and was happy with it.   The Chef looked a little shabby and needs a haircut and a shave.   I shall be back but for lunch, and skip the ETOH. Much better value proposition."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and it never disappoints.  The food is from farm to table which I love and the menu changes daily.  Love the steak hache, tartar, and the oysters."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the farm-to-table movement and Union does it beautifully. I had one of the best meals of my life here, and loved the warm, friendly, non-pretentious atmosphere. Had the elk sliders and pasta. My partner had the steak and frites (excellent fries). But the whole reason I went there was to try the sticky ginger cake (like sticky toffee pudding) with salted caramel. Divine. If I could afford to eat here regularly, I would."}
{"text":"I've been going to Union for over 4 years, definitely a fan. I often seem to find myself there on a Monday nights as they do 1/2 price bottles of wine! The steak tartare is arguably the best in the city, and the elk sliders are always a good bet. I particularly love sitting sitting at the chefs bar to watch the talented kitchen crew work their magic in a small but efficient space. Union is definitely one of the go to's on Ossington who never seem to disappoint. I hope they stick around for a while."}
{"text":"Might be a bit biased as I had only lived in Toronto for a few months before trying out this restaurant. But it certainly was an amazing experience! Make sure you make reservations as it's a small restaurant but if your able to get a table, they will make sure you are comfortable and getting everything you need to have an enjoyable dinner. The concept is focused on local fresh ingredients and that certainly doesn't hurt them. My date and I had the prime rib for too, amazing amazing dish and highly recommended. The menu is very simple and small but they do it well."}
{"text":"I have never been so excited to write a review... seriously   My friend took me here for the first time tonight and I will be back again, not only for the food but for the lady in the stripped shirt the guy with the beard, dan one of the chefs and the team of tylers. I sat at the bar, a big win.  I ordered the elk burgers- fantastic The lake trout , which was served with smashed potatoes that were dressed in yogart, sour cream,dill and oilive oil......SOOO good.   On top of all of these already great things, Tyler and I got to talking. He loves food, as do I .... and he loves sharing his food... something I am not as good at.  I got to nibble on varies components of the meat platter, a beautiful goat cheese, steak tar tar , pickled veggies and of course the pickles.  As I was eating I got to sit and watch tyler ice a flourless chocolate cake.....and prep everything that came out of the kitchen.   What I love about this place: The staff, I expected some hipster weird pretentious staff, and although there were some black rimmed glasses and lots of facial hair being rocked, they staff was amazing.   It was unlike any dining experience I have ever had before.  I also loved,  that there organic delievery had come in the same time I was there, this man was hilarious. His farm is from a small town waterford, and he pointed it out on the map for me . He was a little weird but so into what he does.   One nice fact: Tyler sent over some meat to a table of two men and to thank tyler the men asked to buy him a glass of wine for after work. How nice....   One last note:I was told by my friend that the chef Teo Paul is just as yummy as the food. I will go back to make sure this statement is true."}
{"text":"This is just for drinks!!  Fantastic grapefruit Collins.  Came towards the end of the night, everyone working there was very sensitive of our situation.  Which was drunk from earlier outings."}
{"text":"Best food I have had in a long time! The menu is creative and different, a must try! A friend and I went for a late lunch, I started with a Caesar and although there was not much garnish the drink was delicious. We shared 3 plates, the elk sliders were delicious, highly recommended! The pickled pickerel was very well done, cooked perfectly and tasty. We also had the crab and pork belly *tartain* I think? Anyways it was SOO GOOD! The mushrooms, huge pieces of REAL crab! But it didn't stop there, the dessert, we had the sticky ginger cake, basically a sticky toffee, it was to die for, my friend said it was the best dessert she ever had, not too sweet or gingery, we will definitely be going back. Keep it up Union!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good. Friendly, efficient service. Nice atmosphere (the music is NOT too loud, contrary to some reviewers' opinions), lovely patio out back. I was dining alone so I sat at the front bar. I had the ontario peaches and pears as an app, very simply presented in large pieces amongst some fresh leafy greens and drizzled with quinoa and a sharp wine based vinaigrette to add contrast to the sweetness of the fruit. My main was the polenta- a large chunk grilled crispy on the sides, coated with a soft-ripened cheese-- didn't catch what kind but it tasted like Oka or something similar-- and swimming in a heavenly tomato sauce. My server explained that they use mostly their own tomatoes grown in the restaurant's garden. There were less pedestrian items on the menu, but I was looking to see how Union would do with very simple comfort foods, and they totally rocked it. Topped it off with a delicious slice of homemade pecan pie, a recipe belonging to the pastry chef's/barkeep's mom. The only annoyance was the overly spoiled guy who argued loudly for 5 minutes with the host that he had a patio table reserved when the restaurant doesn't accept patio reservations. It's all about the food man, just sit where you're seated and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The steak frites was amazing!  My husband had the sticky ribs, and they too were delicious.  Ended it with the banana bread pudding.... YUM!  We went with a group of 5, and my only beef was that the sides are served family-style.  So with 5 different people and 5 different appetites, it was a bit difficult to get your fair share of the sides that you liked best.  Who wants to get confrontational when one of their co-diners takes too much of the best side?    But the food was delish, and great concept - all fresh and local food from the chef's family farm.  They make whatever they can with what is fresh that week.  And all the meat comes from one animal.  I didn't love being told that before I cut into my steak (I don't like being reminded where my meat comes from).  But a good bit of news to know nonetheless.  About $65 each including drinks."}
{"text":"Union is a must try when in Toronto.  A french bistro with a Canadian flare, Union is an exceptional restaurant.  One of the many charms is that they use ingredients from local farms and butchers.  I will say that I preferred their lunch and dinner to their brunch.  The brunch is good, but similar to many brunch spots.  But it is at lunch and dinner that Union shines.  Great selection of oysters.  And all their main dishes are so well prepared.  And on Tuesday nights, they have $12 plates!  And if you are up for an experience (and have a party of 2) - get the Cote de Boeuf if they have it on the menu.  A huge steak that fills the stomach and the soul."}
{"text":"came here on a Sunday and went with their $40 3 course prix fixe (I think it is only offered on Sundays). great value! got the crab bisque as my starter and it was tasty. could use a bit more crab \"essence\"/taste? but really well done. Others got the steak tartare and it was tasty. I went with the steak hache for my main (basically a burger patty cooked rare, topped with a fried egg) and it was awesome. They season it a bit sweet so it had a pseudo-kalbi taste to it. Not sure if this was intended but I enjoy kalbi, so I loved the patty. Dessert was a sticky ginger cake that was smothered in salted caramel syrup. Very satisfying.   Portions were just right so you don't have to eat until you feel like you are going to explode, but you'll definitely be full with the prix fixe.   Great value for $40 in this neighbourhood. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was there last night with my husband and another couple. Had the roast chicken with elk sliders to start and soft chocolate cake for dessert. My favourite was actually the kale that came with the roast chicken. It was infused with truffle oil and I couldn't get enough of it. The Margery was also a nice take on their margarita. Very yummy.  I like how they were fast with the food but wasn't fast on kicking you out with the bill. We were able to relax and chat with our friends. Great night!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I started with the tartare which was incredible. Then I had the trout which was pretty good. Dessert was excellent as well. I strongly recommend this place. Portions are on the large side-- so be ready to overeat and overindulge!"}
{"text":"All fresh and local daily menu.  Do yourself a favor with the BBQ Rib Benny for brunch! Add Chilli jam and/ or Habanero for spice. Mid week 1/2 price bottles of vino."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. So damn good! They've found a perfect balance between sticking to what they're good at and mixing up the menu (daily.)   My favourite Toronto restaurant. I come here way too often but it has never let me down so I'll keep going back.  I have no advice on what to order as it's all amazing ... actually, scratch that, the elk sliders are something special."}
{"text":"I was there for Brunch this past Sunday and only have good things to say.  The ambiance, the service and the food were all really great and made for an awesome start to our afternoon. We went at noon and the place wasnt overly full so my bf and I could actually have a conversation. I can definitely see this place being a part of my Sunday routine.  (The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because of the limited vegetarian options - although they do accommodate with good substitutions.)"}
{"text":"We weren't planning to eat here, but I'm really glad we did.  My friend made us a reso for Enoteca Sociale over a month in advance. We had some friends coming in from out of town and wanted to plan something nice.  When we arrived our table wasn't ready....but after waiting over an hour for our table and being told that it might be 'just a few more minutes', we placed a call to Union. They were able to accomodate our group immediately, so off we went. So happy we did.  Given how our night began, it was easy to recognize great service when we experienced it. Our server was more like the 7th member of our table - charming, charasmatic and glad to see us. Knowing that we had just come from a bad experience down the street, she put our food orders in before our drinks to get the food to us faster. Seriously - thank you and will you be my friend?  The menu is small and changes regularly, but there is a little something for everyone.   I had the sticky ribs, which I would absolutely recommend. It's a generous portion but still left me yearning for more of the sauce. Easy to eat with a knife and fork.  Save room for the potatoes that are served family style at the table. Sort of reminded me of a warm potato salad. Frites are also served family style with all mains.  We were a group so a lot of different dishes made an appearance at our table: Haddock cakes, tomato soup, charcuterie plate, union salad, pork chop and trout all got rave reviews.  Thank you Union - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really nice service. Very tasty food. Had delicious union salad and zucchini soup. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Basing this rating on the prix fixe (as have only tried that) for dinner on Sunday- an amazing deal, with three satisfying and thoughtful courses for $40. Overall, excellent food, wine selection, and atmosphere.  Standouts were the fowl and halibut, and the caramel cheesecake.  Details were well-attended to, such as the flavourful salsa on the fish, and balanced presentation and tastes to the starters (scallop crudo, peaches & roquefort).  Will definitely be returning for dinner again, and recommending to family/friends!"}
{"text":"Love the food, although their idea of \"medium rare\" is not perfected..  Service is generally attentive and courteous.   Love this place"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the mussels and ask for a side of bread.  Whatever they do to the bread is off the hook.  Also, you won't be sorry if you save room for the sticky ginger cake.  A little pricey for what it is.  Though that mural is so gorgeous and the service and staff are lovely.  Other things tried maybe to not be repeated: steak frites (too expensive for what it is), polenta gratin (not really a gratin, and significantly more tasty if I could get the cheese, polenta, greens and tomatoes all in one (big) bite)."}
{"text":"Well tonight I had those Elk sliders. I captialize Elk because I feel they've earned it. Majestic creatures. OK, it was pretty small - but it was perfect. Popped down four in aprx 2 min. Great service. Monday nights is half price wine (!?). OK, Union. I'm buying what you're selling (delicious Elk)."}
{"text":"I give it a 4 star but only because the kitchen was super slow getting our food out the last time I was here. It's been better though, maybe they were just having a night which is understandable as it was super busy. The food here never fails me, good old comfort french food...good for the soul. The server we had was awesome! He had an English accent and was very friendly, funny and attentive. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is usually out of my price range, but for a special occasion, I can't think of a better place to splurge. It was as delightful as I would have hoped a restaurant named \"Union\" to be. My beef/egg dish was an absolute delight. I loved homemade shoestring fries and the veggies and pickles that came with it. All of the ingredients were locally sourced and (possibly) organic. The service was perfect. It's wonderful visiting a restaurant where everyone seems proud of their work. I also loved the antique bathroom fixtures. They played an entire Paul McCartney album which I found quite tired, but they switched to something better afterwards. Looking forward to my next visit. I now consider Union the pride of the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"Great food!   Since everyone else on yelp ordered the ribs, so i decided something different, the rotisserie chicken. it was delicious.  I loved the mushroom.  The veggie at the bottom was not that great but the overall taste was so good to compensate for that.  My husband ordered the swordfish and it is just as delicious. Definitely come back for their dessert next time. :)"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10  Looking for a quick and light bite on the Ossington strip, stopped by Union and had their self-titled salad. It was exactly what I was looking for: bright, light, but full of flavour.  The salad is coated in a mustard dressing which may be a bit strong for some, but it is dressed well. It comes with bacon, poached eggs, chevre cheese, and potato rosti so crispy and delicious you'll want more than the 2 that come with the dish.  I'm judging purely on this one plate, but if it's an indication of the other food, I'll definitely be back.  THE BOTTOM LINE: using the Union salad as a gage for the food, the gage looks damn good and you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Came for their monday half priced bottles, and stayed for the food!!!  Elk sliders, I read all the hype about you. I'm not into burgers/sliders so I planned on looking right through you at arrival. Then I saw you on the menu: mirin galangal glaze?! Description of blue ginger & mirin is getting me all warm inside. But like I said, I don't care for sliders. Moving on...wait...what did the server just walk by with? That smell...I creepily scoped out the dish that passed, and I couldn't deny it any further. I knew it was you. Mini elk patties perched confidently on challah toast w/ glaze thoughtfully drizzled around you. I gave in. And my, have I fallen for you. Will not forget that first bite of rich, savoury flavor seeping into my mouth with the perfect tenderness and subtle sweetness of the challah to balance.  Steak tartare, you were ground so fine, a speck of the house made habanero and a couple grains of dijon was enough to soak right in to each bite to give an amazing kick. I lay you gently on my tongue and you simply disintegrate, leaving me wanting more and more. I would be happy with you all over that toast and habanero as an entire meal.  Although I rarely order dessert, I saw you, sticky ginger cake. Ginger infusion perfection. Nuts and thin toffee bits add a nice texture w/ ice cream on the side to break up the sweet toffee sauce.   Seemed like 75% of diners ordered the sticky ribs, so will definitely return to give those a try, along with steak hache. And of course more sliders. And tartare. And ginger cake."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for our first dinner at Union, in part because of the rapturous buzz, in part because of the complexity of securing a reservation (more about this below). Our companions: the foodiest of our foodie friends, on a weekend pass from Ottawa, ready to be dazzled. I'm not sure there was any dazzling done this night, but we left full and satisfied.   Things started well: our table was waiting for us when we arrived. Given the reputation some of the hottest joints in town have of making patrons wait long past their reservation times, I took this as a good sign.  Then, eventually, came the food.   Appetizers: 1) Beef Tartare: a lovely little cube of raw steak haché, with grainy mustard, a little pile of ground pepper, and a firey hot sauce on the side. Excellent! I'd happily have it again. A. 2) Elk Sliders - tiny open-faced burgers on little triangular slices of bread. Beautifully seasoned and moist, a little gamey as elk should be - this is the app I'll order next time. A+ 3) Charcuterie Platter: melt-in-your-mouth pastrami (brilliant), respectable pork rillette, and... I didn't catch what the mystery-meat-looking thing was, but it was the only part the four of us didn't polish off. B+ 4) grilled sardines. In reality a salad with one smallish sardine on top. I didn't taste it, but from the look on our friend's face, I'd give the dish a C.   Mains: 1) Two of us found the pork ribs impossible to resist - especially with the promise of a piece of pork belly, which turned out to be beautifully smokey and unctuous - the best part of the dish. The ribs themselves were nicely caramelized and falling off the bone, but in the end a little dry. And the huge, super-rich portion left me feeling a bit overwhelmed (and I'm a good eater). B+ 2) Beef tenderloin was polished off without sharing and pronounced excellent. A 3) Fish special -  simply made and presented (good), but a little overcooked. B  Desserts: my better half and I shared the bread pudding, recommended by the server. Tiny portion was, by that point in the meal, just the right amount for two, and delicious. Friends' apple crumble and panna cotta were pronounced excellent... but by that point I was too stuffed to sample.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable, but a bit run off her feet. No one seemed to be helping her, and it felt like the place could have used one more staffer working the floor.  Oh yes, and the reservations. It seems that reservations can only be confirmed by the manager, so if you call and get someone else on the phone, all they can do is take your request and promise that the manager will call you back. Is that promise always kept? Nope. Do they show any concern when a customer calls back the next day to inquire? Not the time I called. All's well that ends well, but really, Union. Join the modern age and stop making your customers jump through hoops. Open Table makes everything easy and transparent."}
{"text":"After a day of drinking beer at various brey pubs the food at Union was much needed. This is a really cool small place with a cute hipster design and great service. Tried a few things off the lunch menu, and had a cocktail, they did a great job with the food and the drinks."}
{"text":"Website needs an update. First, it suggests the restaurant is open for lunch 7-days a week. Clicking on the Menu link you see a Lunch and Dinner heading. Unfortunately, no Lunch menu under the Lunch heading. Yelp suggests the restaurant's hours do not include Tuesday but the site suggests its open for dinner.  No matter how good the food may be, visitors to the city don't like to visit an area and find conflicting information."}
{"text":"Very pleasant place to eat.  I really enjoyed the simply but hearty food.  Very classic flavors."}
{"text":"In a heartbeat, I would visit Toronto again just to have brunch at Union. It was the best meal we had on our 3 day vacation and probably the best brunch we've had this year. That's a bold statement considering we live in the brunch capital of the U.S. We had the Crispy Polenta and Swiss Train Ride-- both were phenomenal and like nothing we've had before. Our server was a bit confused, but the food easily made up for it."}
{"text":"Food, wine list, service and ambience all tops! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for a long overdue catch up session with a good friend.  The entire experience was weird.  We were given menus when we were first seated.  We had them for quite a while and had trouble deciding what we wanted, as there were a few good options to choose from.  After about 20 minutes, someone came by to check which menu we had, and told us we had the wrong menu.  She quickly grabbed our menus and gave us the replacement.  When my date asked if the revised menu was much different, she simply said there were a few slight changes.  We quickly discovered that what she meant was, the prices were wrong on the first menus.  They meant to charge us a few dollars more for everything.  I was torn between the horse (special of the day) and the sticky ribs.  I was afraid the horse would be more meat than I could handle and opted for the ribs.  We were told that the side of frites was huge and ordered one for the two of us.  The ribs were just okay, nothing memorable, but very filling.  The frites were a smaller portion than described and also nothing special.  I had a great time with my date - fantastic conversation the entire time.  When it came time to splitting the bill, we discussed how much we would each over-tip.  We both ended up being quite generous, and then rounding up.  A few steps outside of the restaurant, we asked ourselves: why???!!  So the menu mix-up was minor.  As was the lie they told about the portion-size of the frites.  The annoying part was that my date had ordered a beer.  He got his first beer and finished that about mid-way through the meal.  He was offered a second one and he accepted.  But after waiting 10 minutes, it didn't arrive.  After 30 minutes, it still didn't come.  And then, he just lost hope.  When we were pretty much done our meals, our waitress came by and asked if he ever got his beer.  He said he had just assumed it was never coming.  She responded with she had just assumed someone else had brought one to him.  Not once was there an apology.  She asked if he still wanted it, but we were getting ready to leave and he was no longer thirsty.  I can't believe it took so long for her to realize it was forgotten, and then her non-apologetic response was far from excellent customer service.  If I could, I would take some of the tip back.  I had high hopes for Union, but was highly disappointed.  Thank goodness I still had a fantastic time, thanks to my date.  Also, the tables are far too close together.  I appreciate that there isn't much space in there, but it was hard not to listen to every word of the conversation at the next table.  It was even harder to pretend I wasn't listening."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Wednesday evening, the place was hopping in a good way. The atmosphere is enjoyable with nice lighting and decor. We had the beef tartar, union salad and soft shell crab. The beef tartar was very good and was large in portion-  though the bread it was served with was a type of sour dough and took away from the flavour of the beef. The union salad was in a delicious mustard seed vinaigrette served with out-of-the-pan thick cut bacon, chèvre, and the most delicious potato Rosti ever. To follow we shared the soft shell crab which was in a flavourful sauce with asparagus and what seemed like cabbage - very good. Overall a good experience though our main course came about 35 minutes after we had finished our appetizers, they could improve on the timing of this."}
{"text":"Terrible  service , overpriced and pretentious. Unfriendly  servers.  The host did not note down our reservation.  Me and girlfriend dressed causal and we received  cold reception, seated by the corner at the  bar.  The food was not impressive.  The  steak was fatty and we were told to move our handbags so they can squeeze  additional  patrons on already  crowded bar. We barely  had space for  our  food. Also, there were poor air circulation , the place  smelt like wet diapers. It is sad to see Ossington  going  down hill. It is  no longer  the place  for  genuine company and quality food. From this experience  of Union, ossington  is sadly  becoming fake and pretentious just like so many other places in the city :("}
{"text":"I only came in for a drink in the afternoon and the kitchen was not open yet. But it was cool bar with friendly staff."}
{"text":"great staff, great food. I really dig this place...I am never dissappointed when I eat here."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing.  I would recommend anything that comes with the french fries.  I ordered a burger (not on the menu but derives out of Steak Hache, comes with fantastic bun).  The vibe is very comfortable yet hip.  Sticky ginger cake was amazing.  There was one downside in our experience - we attended Friday evening and had made a reservation for 8:30 pm. We were told our table was not ready and had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated.  This obviously was not a good situation; however, the restaurant kept offering us free drinks while waiting, and when we declined they instead brought us a delicious charcuterie dish (recommended).  In any event, the situation was not perfect, but the restaurant acknowledged and tried to rectify the situation as best they could.  We still ended up having an amazing time notwithstanding the delay."}
{"text":"Great place. Tried the brunch Union Salad and it was delicious. Bacon was crispy and the potato ball was amazing. Great cocktails also."}
{"text":"Went to union last Friday. It was a very enjoyable evening. The setting is very nice.  I ordered the cod fish and it was delicious. The fish was cooked with a garlic/thyme/rosemary sauce and it was amazing.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I visited Union during the holidays w my husband and sister & brother-in-law for lunch. I ordered the gnocchi w pork & beef ragu. My husband ordered the burger; my sister the polenta & bro-in-law the salmon. We all really enjoyed our food & wine. The portions are big, so a very filling lunch. There are lighter (salad/soup) options too.  The main reason I gave Union 3-stars and not 4 is that they need to work on their interior temperature control. There was no barrier between the front door and the seating area except a flimsy curtain that was constantly being opened. So with the -20C outside it made for a uncomfortably frigid meal experience. Folks at the front bar were fully bundled up in coats while drinking. If they are trying to go for the Ice Hotel experience they hit the nail on the head. My advice spend the money and get a real double door installed."}
{"text":"We love this place, and we've been for brunch and dinner, several times. The food is excellent. We've sat at the window bar looking onto the street and the bar looking into the kitchen - both are cool experiences that offer something a little different from the ordinary table in the middle of the room. It's perhaps a bit on the pricey side - not outrageous - but worth it.  My only complaint is that since the menu changes everyday there is a good chance if you live something you won't see it again on the menu!"}
{"text":"A very solid 4*, we had a great time.  I came with my wife, 2 yo son, and my mother for an early Mother's Day celebration dinner on a Monday evening.  Why not 5*?  Some places do some things better.  But, as an overall experience, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and would come back.  Service - Very friendly, hospitable, and what I would hope for in a local establishment.  They were especially understanding & accommodating to our boy (\"do you want his food to come asap, or as how the meal progresses?\").  :)  Food - The menu on this evening was superb.  So many choices, we wanted & ordered more than we could stomach.  They make their own pasta, and my wife's Gin & Tonic had their own tonic! A variety of flavours and tastes, my favourites that dinner included a scallop crudo, elk sliders, halibut, pappardelle.  The apple bread pudding too.  Textures & temperatures were spot on.  The beef tartar & steak were so-so, I was hoping for more flavour, but they were still good."}
{"text":"Been here probably ten times. Lively atmosphere and French hearty fare. Great when you wanna do something but not party hard..   You must have their sticky ribs, elk sliders and sticky toffee pudding. Also their fries are to die for."}
{"text":"- everyone who has written a review talks about the elk sliders. yes, they are damn good. bambi is delicious. - will have to come back again for the sticky ribs, as they were all out by the time our group arrived. - ambiance here is great, and it was pretty busy for a tuesday night. (must be the half price bottle of wine special they have going on) - our server was very attentive, and although she didnt know what amaretto was (maybe they dont have it in australia), she did pour up a seriously good caesar. habanero (sp?) and soy sauce made this thing realllllly good. #2 in the city, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in the city. The elk sliders are just perfect and who knew French fries dipped in a creamy aioli can be so delicious. A hidden gem in the city. Great service and even better food. Farm fresh ingredients are turned into a delicious meal. Union cannot be missed."}
{"text":"Piling on the praise.  The food was delicious. We split 3 apps - steak tartare (delicious), grilled octopus (good), and elk sliders (fantastic).  My own main was the steak hache, which was delicious, but was too much like the tartare. The fries were also delicious. Next time I will be getting the elk sliders + sticky ribs. I really wanted to cheesecake, but we had to run, so next time that's getting gobbled up too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Half off bottles of wine on Mondays are great. The steak heche is THE best dish I think I've ever had."}
{"text":"To start, I really like the vibe here. The interior decor and layout is really funky and modern. There patio is without a doubt one of the nicest ones in the areA. Server was very chill and friendly. Brunch was a little expensive but a big portion so come with an appetite. Best part was their beautiful back patio. I had the sunnyside special which was super yum and the bacon strips with it was flavourful. My only schtick w the place is coffee is not refillable. Bare in mind, it's great coffee and better than most brews. But if your goin to charge 17 bucks average for breakfast id think coffee refillable would be a nice touch! Their cocktail list looks amazing and good variety but again major dollar signs! But coming for a night cap here in the cool interior or lovely patio on a summer night can't be beat"}
{"text":"I must have been here on an off day because I've been back a few times since and love this spot now. The cote du beouf is lovely and accompaniments are seasonal and tasty. Service is great too. Very knowledgable staff.   My only complaint is that they don't seem to answer their phone during the day for reservations and you can't make them online..."}
{"text":"It was a real treat. The food was amazingly good, as the ingredients are fresh and the cooking is terrific. The seasonings of dishes are one of kind, also their wonderful wine selection.   One star was taken off because:  1. I had a bad booking experience. I called around 1:30 in a weekday, and whoever picked up was placed me on hold for over 20 minutes.  2. Open kitchen with all the cooking smoke in the restaurant... I mean, this is not an izakaya"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Union more stars. The truth is the food was amazing, but the overall experience was less than satisfactory.   There are too many tables in this small space. I was practically on top of the person sitting at the table beside me and could hear their conversation so clearly, I felt like I was eavesdropping. At one point it was hard to even be in the room, my thoughts drowned out by the roar and echoes of ambient chatter. What I'm saying is: it's extremely loud at Union on a Saturday night. Go there for the food, not the atmosphere.   The service was decent, with servers racing around, squeezing through tiny crevices between tables.  But as I said, the food was amazing for the most part.   We had:   Elk sliders - 5/5 tender and juicy and delicious. Try this!  The pear appetizer (can't think of exact name) - 3/5  I was surprised that this was cold. Also it said it came with sunchokes but I saw no sunchokes in mine. The blend of flavours was nice when I took a bite with the right amount of pear and cheese, but it was nothing special.    The steak hache - 5/5 this was delicious! I don't know what they seasoned it with but it was perfection. Just the right amount of sweet with the meat.  Swordfish - 4/5 slightly bland but still good.  For dessert we had cheesecake with salted caramel- 3/5 there was too much caramel on the plate and the caramel was a bit over salted for my taste.   I don't know if I would return to Union because of the noise level and how cramped it was. If this restaurant was in a larger space, or took out 3 tables I would be back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Nice place...Food was delish! We had the softshell crab, arctic char and steak hache.. everything was perfect! The sticky ginger cake was simply amazing! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice brunch place. I had the benedict here and the portion is very generous, a bit too generous."}
{"text":"Beautiful & cozy restaurant. Had the elk sliders & oysters to start off with and they were amazing!! Then steak with fries which were unluckily a bit salty. But still delicious. We were immediately offered a dessert by the chef.  The white wine (Grüner Veltliner) was just perfect!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried coming to this place a few times but kept getting turned away because I didn't have a reservation, best part is the restaurant was stark empty and it was 8:30 pm! We walked by it after going next door at 9:30 and it was still empty. Oh boy. Made a reservation, food was extremely heavy, fatty, - almost trying hard to be so - service pretentious - service staff more interested in picking each other up then serving. Not sure if I'll be back. Too fatty. Heavy on the stomach and didn't feel so great the  next day."}
{"text":"Saturday night on the Ossington Strip could not have been more delightful! A warm earthy feel welcomes you when you walk into Union and their back patio with a lovely tree canopy cover! The four of us ordered oysters, octopus salad, elk sliders and ox heart for apps and the mackerel entree to share - everything was delish!! The ox heart was tender and flavourful, the octopus was delicately seasoned and the oysters were fresh with amazing sauces! The mackerel was a whole fish serves with mustard seeds and house-made pesto atop apples and potatoes - tender and bursting with natural flavours! We topped off the night with ginger cake and vanilla ice-cream which was difficult to share! Service was fantastic, food was great! Would totally eat here again!"}
{"text":"I alway feel like I'm in Paris when I'm here because it's so delicious but unpretentious I love it! It's great for just a drink or a full meal. Serious go-to for wine lovers."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food.  It's fantastic, fresh, original and fun.  We shared 3 appetizers and 2 mains and all them were excellent.  I really like the way the chef has made use of chilis to add another dimension to salads, fries, etc.  Portions were just the right amount of generous. The staff were perfect.  And I've heard great things about the patio.  Had I been on the patio, this might have been a 5 star review.    But we ate in the dining room, and I couldn't wait to get the fuck out of this restaurant.  Between the clanging of plates from the open kitchen and the discount stereo speaker directly over my head, the sound level was absolutely overwhelming.  We cut the meal short and begged for the check.  I can't imagine ever eating in this dining room again. But I know that I care way more about my aural surroundings than the average diner.  So let's settle on 4 stars for this review.  I think you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I found this place amazing. Service was fantastic. The hipster clientele made me laugh because  I thought that was last year with people wearing beards. Anyways it was amazing. Other than hipsters and beards. Lol"}
{"text":"If hell existed, you would be sitting on this patio, hungry and with your mouth sewn shut as the servers put plate upon plate in front of you.  Chad, Eric and I came here on a whim. We were passing by when Chad said \"Hey, this place is really good.\" Understatement of the year. We sat out on their back patio where we got to smell a wood burning fire all through dinner. There was a man shucking oysters in the back and smoking a few in a smoker. I could live there. I would be fat, poor and occasionally rained on, but I'd be happy.  Smooth Eric went over to the oyster guy and asked for a dozen oysters for us. The man was really excited about these new clams he got in and wanted us to try them. He called them Piss Clams, because they squirt at you. Apparently that's what they called them in Newfoundland. The oysters were divine. Perfectly briny and incredibly fresh. The clam was a little on the fishy side, but in a way that I really enjoyed. I could have eaten a dozen on my own.  For the entree, I had the Steak Hache Aller Retour, which is sort of like a seared steak tartar. A beautiful piece of meat is cut into cubes, then formed into a patty and seared. The menu says it's rare on the inside. It's not. It's raw. And PERFECT. The fried egg just sends it over the top. You know the food is amazing when all conversation becomes centred on how delicious your meal is and everyone heaves a huge sigh with every bite. The fries came family style on the side and were crispy-soft bistro frites with what looked like homemade mayo. Love. We also ordered a trio of elk sliders, which were impossibly creamy and delicious. All the ingredients tasted super fresh and flavours were perfectly balanced. Textures were incredible and varied from the soft inside of the steak to the crispy bite of the veggies that came with it.   To drink, I had a dark and stormy, which was rum and ginger beer. It was zingy, just sweet enough and refreshing. I sort of like this resurgence of classic cocktails.   Service was fantastic. Our server was very professional and was eager to give us tips on what to order. I also loved the oyster guy, who came buy to chat with us about oysters and clams at the end of our meal. This guy is clearly really into oysters, and his passion is infectious. He said he'll be there all summer so MAKE SURE YOU GO. I'm already making plans to return with the Hubster.   The atmosphere is casual and friendly, which makes the meal so much better. It's high-end French cuisine without the snooty service and stuffy dining room. Another thing we couldn't stop saying last night: If you take a date to this place, you're gonna get laid."}
{"text":"We came for the Monday half-off wine special, and stayed for everything else. Excellent service and excellent food, from the lip-puckeringly spicy Caesars (the Canadian cousin to the Bloody Mary), served with an optional oyster, to the locally-smoked trout and creamy risotto, and all of it topped off with a satisfying local coffee and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake.   We were impressed to learn that the chef brings in stuff from his own farm, upping the freshness factor, but perhaps equally impressive is his curation of other local goods, like the locally-caught fish and Scotch Mountain Meats. As out-of-towners, it was a treat to be able to sample all that Toronto's food-growing region has to offer during the fall season, in such a lovely, comfortable setting."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Union 5 stars (and I would have about a month ago). As a frequent diner here, lately I've been getting \"misses\" on the execution of the regular dishes. The sous vide eggs have been overcooked (chalky yolks, not runny) on the pulled pork dish at brunch and the fish dish I got recently at dinner was overly citrusy and salty.  I don't think I'll be coming back, unfortunately, it's a lot of $$ to drop on mediocre preparation of food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  It was the perfect atmosphere for a nice casual lunch with friends.  The food was excellent!  A small menu but each item on it seemed very unique.  And all the prices seemed quite reasonable for the quality ($10-15).  The service was a little bit slow but it didn't really bother us much.  I'd definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Went with a girlfriend for dinner on a Monday and it was packed! By 7pm the cote de boeuf was sold out! In a panic, I clutched the server's sleeves and he responded by giving us a similar fare but with top sirloin. It was a great family style meal with delicious fries and vegetables.  My mouth waters just thinking about it. The dessert was pecan pie and I found that it was not as memorable since it was a little hard on the crust.  It was loud but that is the price you pay for a great atmosphere.  I liked that they vacuumed sealed your leftovers.  That is a cunning idea which shows how much they value flavour and freshness.  I will definitely go here again to have the ell sliders and sticky ribs:)"}
{"text":"My go-to neighbourhood spot for brunches and dinners that never disappoint. Mostly local (southern Ontario within ~150km of TO) small-scale suppliers. Food, service, and atmosphere are always great. If you're two, get a couple stools at the chefs table, or if a group sit in the quaint back patio if it's open."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it looked like they were prepping for their dinner rush.  However, we were seated outside on their hidden patio near the very back of the restaurant. We ordered drinks and a small appy of cold cut meats with bread which was delicious.  Our server was attentive and extremely profressional...maybe even too professional because he didnt laugh at any of our jokes...   Anyways... I will be coming  back here to try out the main entrees along with the wonderful apps.  This review is strictly based on the service and quick drinks they gave us.  Everything was awesome."}
{"text":"I came here with my best girlfriend and her plus one.  I've heard of this restaurant and have never been, so I was excited to check it out.  When we first walked in, it was quite busy for a Saturday evening.  The restaurant has a little bar area for people to have drinks and a couple of seats where people would have dinner service.  It was a pretty small and casual restaurant, but it was nicely decorated with wooden tables and all the walls were all brick from it's original form.  Lucky for us, we made reservations ahead of time and got seated right away.  We were seated on high tops, right by the kitchen where you see the chefs making all the food.  I was informed that the restaurants' menu changes everyday according to what is at the farm and that they use all fresh ingredients to make their dishes.  I ordered the Moules Marinere (mussels) and a pint of beer.  The mussels were so delicious and served immediately after the chefs prepared the dish.  It had a flavourful white cream sauce with some celery and thyme and it complimented the mussels really well.  They also served homemade bread with butter and I used the bread to dip into the sauce after I devoured the mussels.  After my main dish, I was too full to order dessert but my bestie offered to share her Crème Brûlée.  I obviously did not pass this up and took a couple bites of her dessert!  It was the most delicious Crème Brûlée I have ever had with the perfect consistency and just the right amount of sweetness to it.  It was a fun experience and I would love to come back here again some time.  The price you pay here is for good quality food and you can tell that the food is made with love and care."}
{"text":"Ever wondered how we can cure vegetarianism?  Well tonight I found the answer.  Find the nearest vegetarian and ask them if they squint when they yawn.  They'll pause--then imitate one.  And when they do, crush one of Union's Elk Sliders into their mouth and viola, vegetarianism cured!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the tagliatelle with a side of vegetables and they were both great. my friend had a manhattan and it was the best manhattan either of us have ever had. the service was perfect. i usually expect stand-off-ish service in this neighbourhood but all the staff were attentive and unpretentious and friendly. i can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Hands down on of my favs in Toronto!  I love the atmosphere, the food, the service - it's a must go for a nice dinner out.  Sat at the Chef's table, chef could have been more personable, but the service staff was spectacular.  Menu changes up because they source out local cuisine, but here goes.  CHACUTERRIE PLATE - this was awesome, there was smoked duck, pate of some sort and another pate of another sort with Bacon!  It was rich and the flavor was so amazing.   STEAK TAR TARE HABANERO, BREAD, BUTTER and PICKLES.  OMG, this dish was to die for, apparently, this is one of their specialities and specialty it was!  I am normally not a fan of tar tare, but this was exceptional.  The meat was tender and flavourful.  It was topped with some delicious butter pickles.  Just a delight.  STICKY RIBS - picture fall of the bones, sticky, full of sauce, flavourful ribs... drool while i write.  It was very rich and full of flavour, just amazing way to top off the night.  PECAN PIE - this was super home made, filled with chunks or pecan topped with homemade whipped cream.  Just delicious.  Didn't try but MUST try next time.  COTE DE BOUEF - watching the chef grill this massive piece of prime rib - holy moley.  Almost fell off my bar stool, it looked so delectable.  A piece of steak serves 2, so they made 3 for a table of 6 - lucky duckies.  The presentation was just like a large plate of sweet, sweet meat.  Also, would like to try their ELK SLIDERS, this is one of their frequently ordered dishes.  All and all, a great experience for a night out.  Our server Stephanie was amazing, was very informative and took the time to explain the whole menu.  She was attentive and checked in often but wasn't too overbearing.  Must go!"}
{"text":"This week's installment of FARCS at large: adventures of Christine and Dea-brings us to the recently hyped Union on Ossington.  Our fellow FARCS arrive at 6:30 on a muggy summer night to take their seats. Luckily they are with reservation and it proves to be a smart undertaking as the joint is hopping with pretty young things well before 8. They take their seats at the banquettes and take a moment to drink in the chic yet casual Ossington decor: exposed brick, wooden floors and a marble bar. A pastoral mural on the side wall of horses and dragon flies signals that this place takes its' local food seriously.   The server for the evening is an affable chap who answers all questions and concerns including the one that our enquiring females have on their minds: Is chef Teo Paul the hottest chef in town? Answer: Yes, quite possibly so.   Moving along, the girls peruse the wine and cocktail list and note the fairness of the prices given the calibre of the restaurant. Cocktails run from $8-9 and wines are priced from $9 but feature some interesting regions in Europe. Christine the resident oeonophile of the pair, summons glasses of Prosecco to start- a light bubbly white wine, easy on the nose. What a welcoming start!   Our FARCS start off with the charcuterie board which consists of corned beef, a pate akin to deviled ham and a country terrine which was tasty enough. The girls having taken in past boards at both Swirl and the famous Black Hoof both decided that this one was not up to snuff with it's lack of cured meats. The summer salad arrived next and it set the girls hearts aflutter with its well prepared combination of lettuces, shallots and mustard seeds. It was layered wtih a creamy, soft chevre, a crisp potato rosti and some delicious house smoked bacon. This one was chowed down heartily and appreciatively.  The arrival of the mains was met with some disappointment by the girls who felt that there the kitchen had faltered somewhat in  execution. Proclaimed sticky ribs were neither sticky nor flavourful and could have used more cooking time to properly carmelize and soften up the meat. Adjoining pork belly was lackluster, it didn't have the \"pop\" or crazy texture of pork bellies past. However, the sweat pea lasagna made up for the sorry ribs by being bright and bouncy in flavours and textures. Thin delicate sheets of pasta, creamy rich ricotta, soothing sweat pea bechamel topped off with fresh crushed tomatoes: this thing was a beauty that tasted of the garden. Sliced slightly cooked slices of zuchini added to the garden fresh taste but sadly the promised eggplant on the menu was MIA. All the main dishes were enjoyed with a platter of yogurt potato salad (bland) and the most wonderful frites in recent memory: hand cut, golden in colour and excellent potato flavour. The accompanying lemon aioli on the side made these frites a big hit with our farcs!  Tummies stuffed and satiated the farcs paid up and tumbled out onto Ossington to enjoy the breezy summer air. Union may be hopping and pretty but it is also a bad place to survive a humid night with its lack of a/c and minimal ventilation.   All in all, a lovely meal was enjoyed by the FARCS on that hot summer evening. The girls took in dishes prepared with care, made with local, fresh ingredients and all at the hands of a fine lookin' chef. Here's hoping the consistency caries more forward into some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Since we live just down the street, we're at Union often. Maybe to the point where they think we're crazy, but it's such a lovely spot to end off the week...and have Sunday brunch!   The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. The servers are beyond kind and appear to truly love working at the restaurant. Drinks are always on point and I have yet to have a dish that I wouldn't order again. I love that they make an effort to constantly offer new items on the menu whilst keeping the classics. Peach and tomato seasons are my fave as it means you get a beautiful dish of fresh fruit with buffala cheese and olive oil. Maybe also a piece of toasty garlic bread too if you're lucky.   A true gem of a restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fun and beautiful menu, inspired. Elegant, understated and rustic presentation.   Had the fixed menu, shared a charcuterie plate, enough for 6 of us, was delightful, too spicy but in a good way. Wonderfully strong Gin Ceasar, (hey, it was Sunday!) For the mains I ordered the Steak Tartare and the roasted pork shoulder, finished with the Chocolate tart. Each and every thing was quietly flavourful and perfectly prepared.  Subtle and pure, just my favourite type of french cooking! The frites are meh, seriously mediocre compared to everything else, should have been double fried, but the sirloin steak three members of my party had was outstanding, 50% fat, which I like, my fellow party guests do not however. Service was impeccable and the patio spot was gorgeous. I want to be back there right now!!!! *Stomps feet petulantly* Kitchen staff looked miserable, don't know why..."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the service was excellent. Very pleasant, personable and genuine. The menu was a little weird. The entrees did not list any sides that came with the dishes. We ended up ordering too much food because we didn't think our mains came with sides. Had the Trout and Sticky Ribs. The trout itself was pretty good. Was served on top of Lobster claws (which I don't think was mentioned on the menu - again very odd). The sides were kale which was very very undercooked, and brussel sprouts which were also undercooked. The Sticky ribs were very good. Cooked perfectly. Again though, same issue with the sides not being cooked properly. The ribs also came with a giant (no exaggeration) bowl of frites which if we had known was the case we definitely would not have ordered so many starters.  Dessert of Pot au Chocolat w/ cherries was exactly what you would expect and was a good end to the meal.  My one service tip would be to maybe explain the components of the dishes as they are dropped off since the menu leaves so much unwritten. We had a hard time figuring out some of the items. ANYWAYS, would go back. Have been a bunch and won't be stopping anytime soon."}
{"text":"You should absolutely, 100% go here for brunch, lunch or dinner. Union plates and amazing array of dishes. Whether your in the mood for a traditional burger or steak tartare, Union has got you covered.   This restaurant is a diamond among many other great restaurants along the Ossington strip, but the combination or service and food selection gives it a leg up. Be warned, many others are also aware of how great Union is, so you should expect to wait for a table.    My personal recommendation for food would be the Swiss Train Ride - a combination of French ham, Swiss cheese, a fried egg, bechamel atop a bed of greens....drool!"}
{"text":"Elk sliders were so yummy!! it came as 3 small pieces of meat sitting on top of a small piece of bread. The sauce was sweet and savory! I loved the pickled-cucumber thing on top of the meat! delicious bite size sensations  I also ordered the sticky ribs --- pretty tender meat and the sauce was sweet and yummy as well. I enjoyed eating that big rack of meat and a large side of fries!   Atmosphere was really dim and had a cozy feel.   However, i didn't enjoy where we sat... because it is just for the 2 of us, we sat against the wall infront of the entry to the bathroom stairwell. I guess its pretty roomy for us...   okok --- I give 4 stars for the elk!! it was my fave mini appetizer!"}
{"text":"The food is very very good. In particular, the elk sliders (cooked rare, very juicy), steak tartar (served on delicious challah with a spicy dijon spread), and roasted walnut beet and goat cheese salad (sounds plain but is so so very good). The grilled octopus was overcooked.  Prices are somewhat reasonable, although mains will set you back into the high $20s. You can, however, get a nice bottle of wine in the $40 range.  Possibly the best service on the Ossington strip. Everyone was friendly, attentive, and polite. None of that standard hipster anger that one would expect in this area. The space is cozy and tastefully decorated.   Minor downside: the lighting (a tad too bright) and the smell of cooking throughout the restaurant. Perhaps this is because the kitchen is open-concept but it's distracting to feel like you are IN the kitchen while you're enjoying your (delicious) meal."}
{"text":"my favourite place in the city. visit 1-2 times each week. brunch and dinner are both amazing. recommend getting to brunch when they open or you'll wait.   simple, fresh, Parisian inspired food, all made with locally sourced and organic ingredients. comfort food at it's finest.   the staff are always extremely friendly. the space is beautiful and the back patio is quaint and cozy.   recommend the elk sliders, flat top breakfast and visiting on Monday for 1/2 priced wine!"}
{"text":"Certainly one of the best bars I went to for my brief visit to Toronto.  My girlfriend and I stopped in for a quick drink while we were exploring Ossington Ave.  We were completely surprised by this place.  Walking in it seemed like it was going to be a sort of pretentious coffee shop/espresso bar.  It turned out to be the complete opposite.  The two bartenders were awesome - very attentive and friendly, and they even suggested other places in the area that we might enjoy.  Even the other customers were friendly and chatty.    We didn't explore the restaurant portion or eat anything there but we were told by several other people (including a few other restaurant owners) that the food there is excellent.  Definitely going to try that next time.  The beer selection was ok, they had a lot more bottles than drafts.  Definitely try the Duggan's #9 IPA.  It was the best beer I had while I was up there."}
{"text":"As I said previously, I'll return to Union when next I return to Toronto. And I made good on my word.   My wife and I shared the stewed chickpeas with fresh fiddleheads, the elk sliders (of course) and fresh morels with crusts of bread. And the delicious ribs with frites and house made mayonnaise.   The chef believes in his menu and it shows in every bite."}
{"text":"Wow I pleasantly surprised with the experience I had at Union. I was expecting the typical so-so service from an up and coming hip new restaurant however we were treated like we were the only ones in the restaurant (it was full).  A++ for taking reservations for 10 people, A+++ for having a booth that faces the TVs that can actually fit 10.   Food and beer prices are fair, quite close to Clinton prices but in a much nicer setting.   Waitress was always available and checked on us frequently, as well as the host.   Great place, will definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Although the rest of Toronto seems to be behind the times with the local, farm-to-table food movement, Union is proof positive that the tides are turning. Food here is simple and well-prepared.  The mains seem to change frequently with the season, but my favorite lunch is the Union Salad, which consists of bibb lettuce, smoked bacon, goat cheese, and a hash brown ball-thing (it's so delicious, trust me), dressed in an absolutely awesome mustard-seed dressing. Easily my favorite salad in the T-dot. I've also loved the seasonal pork roast, and the polenta. Dessert is a bit ho-hum, but they do serve a lovely coffee.    A table is hard to come by without a reservation, but there is room at the bar. Despite the lack of knee-room at the bar, the food is worth the minor discomfort. Service has always been fantastic, and the servers very knowledgable -- they always give great wine recommendations. A meal at Union tends to be quite spendy, but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Made a dinner reservation a couple weeks in advance. They called to confirm a couple days ahead of the reservation but was out of town so missed the call. They cancelled our reservation.  We did not make another reservation and had a wonderful dinner somewhere else.  What was the point of making the reservation in the first place if they just cancel on you?"}
{"text":"I have too many good things to say about this place!  I was enticed by their menu of creative dishes and local themes. I was not disappointed. Union is located on the Ossington strip. Upon entering there is a casual bar area, followed by dining seating. The arrangement is intimate, casual, but not cramped.   I started with a glass of wine. The one I wanted was not served by the bottle but my waiter was quick to check inside and see if there was a bottle open. There was! I appreciated they made the effort to look. There was five of us dining, and we shared the Charcuterie for appetizer. OMG yumminess. It consisted of two meat based spreadable loafs, both made in house. Then an assortment of sauces, and 2 scotch eggs. This was served with home made to-die-for break (my girls who love carbs, go here). For $16 this was a very fair sized appetizer that kept 5 of us happy.  For dinner I had the Tagliatelle.  It was fantastic, with wild mushrooms, hen, and a slightly creamy based sauce. Melt in your mouth fantastic taste. Amongst my friends, one had the cod ( I tried a little piece, it was perfectly creamy and soft), and one the Polenta with a side order of veggies. Can I just say, they provided a very large serving of side for only $6!  For dessert we shared a 'mess', which is a mixture of fresh creme, meringue and berries.  The service at the restaurant was friendly and attentive. Our waiter explained to us all the basic ingredients, such as sauces, bread, noodles are made in house. And they butcher their own meat in house, all sourced from local farms. Wow. I really love knowing where my food comes from."}
{"text":"I still really enjoy the vibe here, but the food seems to be slipping a bit, on a recent visit the tartare was oily. The fluke crudo was good but same issue a puddle of oil at the end. The char was good, but salty (and I'm a person with an expansive collection of salts for home use). Service was good but not great. As in sitting with empty cocktails, waiting for cocktails, when I asked for a glass of red wine there was no \"this is such and such\" just here it is (which in the past wouldn't have been the case as they typically have a fair number by the glass) all in all it's still solid. Just not at that price point the \"I can't wait to go here and have such a fantastic night that I'll talk about it for weeks\" Hopefully it comes back with some summer inspiration!"}
{"text":"Elegantly simple and delicious, I am officially in love with french comfort food. On top of a great wine list, the whole dining experience at this lively and rustic wine bar in Ossington was spot on.   Farm fresh and locally sourced ingredients + talented chef = super fresh and scrumptious affair. It's the details that matter and bread is usually a pretty good first indicator. Toasty, crispy crust and soft & doughy on the inside, the bread was perfect dipping into our French onion soup and mussel sauce.  Highlights: - Mussels: The mussels were small but super meaty and cooked in a fragrant garlicky sauce - loooved. - Elk sliders: this was interesting and was essentially elk meatballs on small toasts. The look was a bit odd but it was yum! The elk was tender and the pickles & glaze really dressed up the taste.  - Skate: Not normally a fan of skate but they nailed it here. Really flavourful and the skate was seared beautifully.  - Sticky ribs: These were fall off the bone and true to its name, it was a sweet and savoury sticky mess which was why it was so good. These came with thin crispy fries & mayo which really threw it over the top.   They have seats by the bar for a casual bite and I heard they also have a sweet patio at the back. Along with very attentive service and overall reasonable prices, Union really kicked my expectations in the butt. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food. I made a reservation tonight but for some reason my name didn't appear in the books. They seated us regardless of not having our reservation down on paper and gave us complimentary champagne for the misunderstanding then later moved us to a better seat in the resto. The food was delicious and creative. Fun vibe too!"}
{"text":"Best food and coolest place in Toronto - Done!  Lots of creativity with the menu & happy to adjust to your specific requests (but u won't want to).    Over 3 days, I loved every meal.  Better than that, I found the Staff to be of the same high standard -Help every guest have a memorable meal, as top priority!  I love this place.  Ali makes a great Martini. However, Hannah is the best server and exponentially adds to your dining experience.    Make a reservation and enjoy..."}
{"text":"Food you must try at Union:  EVERYTHING  I honestly can't narrow it down because literally every meal I have eaten at Union has been delectable.  Definitely check out brunch on Sundays. It costs the same as most brunch places but tastes way better, they serve oysters too. Union is open consistently throughout the week for coffee and croissants in the morning, lunch and dinner: all of it is amazing too.   Go hungry. Split the prime rib dinner for two. If you get an app of charcuterie and a salad I won't blame you, but you'll be bringing a doggy bag home with you, because it's a lot of food! The charcuterie here is really good and always varies - you know it's freshly made.  Great patio in the summertime. Another unique spot is a seat at the bar viewing the kitchen. Watch those people cook!"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest restaurants in the city in terms of food, for the price. One of my faves. Always good, in expensive, and quality is top notch."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Not accommodating. Rude. Left a real bad taste in my mouth. These guys treat patrons like they have the 'honour' of dining."}
{"text":"Probably my new favourite restaurant -- and they take reservations! Small resto that has a lively yet warm vibe. The servers are psychic I swear and so friendly. Impeccable service.  Been there a few times and not one thing has disappointed to date. Loved the elk sliders, steak tartare, steak hache, sticky ribs (best ribs in the city). The portions are filling and satisfying.   Would I be back? Always, and I want to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   They change the menu every day as per my understanding, and everything is 100% organic, from their own affiliated farm, and their own butcher shop.   I ve been here a few times and everything is always delicious.   The first time was for my birthday. We ordered 3 appetizers to share (we were very hungry 3 girls) the steak tartare, the beet salad, and the elk sliders.   The elk sliders were SO good, I just wanted to savour every bite. The steak tartare was also very delicious, and it comes with sweet pickles. I am not a fan of pickles, at all,  but I could not stop eating them. The beet salad was alright, I am just not a big fan of beet.   One of my friends had the duck for her mains. I had a bite, and it was pretty good -- but the Steak et Frites ... wow!!   The steak was cut in little entrecôte pieces, which was perfect.   The second time I  ordered the same dish it was not cut, and there was a bit too much fat on there ... wasn't as good as the first time, but a tasty dish nonetheless.   My partner ordered the sticky ribs, and he really really REALLY enjoyed them.   ALSO this place has GREAT wine, and pretty good service.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"10/10.  I've been here twice, the first time I had the Union Salad (pretty good) & Sticky Ginger cake (divine - must try). The second time, we ducked inside to escape a downpour & stayed for dinner. My husband had the Steak Hache (v. good) I tried the sticky ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone, burned in my epicurean heart deliciousness. Fries are perfect also.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars.   Union is hot. Literally. On a muggy, warm, humid summer night the hottest restaurant on Ossington is about 100 degrees and I can't imagine how hot it was in the kitchen area. I'm pretty sure the staff earned their money last night through pure sweat equity. Union does not have any A/C and the last night the ceiling fans didn't even make a dent in the hot air. Mind you, in my opinion, the hottest thing in Union is the chef, Teo Paul. Oh my my. I'm pretty sure that just about every chick in the place was there to catch a glimpse of him in culinary action. He came out of the kitchen once and you could hear every female head in the place snap around to catch a glimpse of the cookin cutie pie. All that being said, Union is a very beautiful bistro with a straight up homage to European styled dining rooms.   My Yelpie winger & fellow FARC Deanna made us a rez (you can't get in this place without one, trust me on this) and when a resto fills up by 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday evening you know this place is happening. So let's talk food. What I love about eating with Deanna is that we are both really great food sharers and a restaurant like Union really helps to facilitate this especially because they serve the sides \"family\" style.   We started with a Charcuterie board (which is really a slate) and the waiter told how great it was. I warned him up front that Deanna was the Queen of Charcuterie (being a reg. at the Black Hoof!) and then he quickly explained how their own cured meats weren't quite ready yet so it wasn't a conventional charcuterie board. He was right about that, it wasn't. I don't think they should call it a charcuterie board because its not. The surprise of the evening was the salad. Talk about a salad with a wow factor. Soft greens (Boston & leaf lettuces), finely minced shallots and green onions with a large dollop of extremely soft, light airy chevre on top along with a thick hunk of double smoked bacon and here was the kicker, a Rosti potato tucked in underneath. Often cheese like that on a salad can flatted and drown the lettuce, making the salad gloopy but not in this case. There were a smattering of mustard seeds in the salad as well. What a marriage between a very light vinaigrette and all the other ingredients. The Rosti was crispy and hot. There were a lot of textures, flavours and temperatures happening in the salad. By far and away, one of the best salads I've ever eaten in a restaurant.   For mains, we choose Sticky Ribs which as it turned out weren't sticky at all. Initially we could taste what we thought was five spice rub or smoked tea in them but that disappeared quickly. We found the ribs to be tough and chewy as was the pork belly piece that was on the side of the dish. All the mains are sat upon a bed of steamed swiss chard or rhubarb. The other main was a really unusual piece of lasagna made with a sweet pea puree. The pasta was paper thin, very light and layered with thin slices of zucchini in between. The menu said there was eggplant in it but I don't think either of us could see it or taste it. The sweet pea puree has bechamel added to it giving it a smooth, creamier texture. This was the most unusual lasagna I have ever eaten. All mains come with a side dish filled with the most delicious European frites with a dollop of that nasty assed mayo and a pile of smashed up potato. You help yourself. This worked for us and I'm sure Deanna will agree the fries were really a thing of beauty.   The menu in general is small which I like. The special of the day included a chilled soup (meh...chilled soup doesn't float my boat) and a grilled trout. Big props for a decent and reasonably priced wine list. We started with a couple of glasses of gorgeously chilled Prosecco that were perfect. Union offers a decent by the glass list and I opted to try and Bastianich and Deanna ordered up a glass of Grenache. Both wines were good but warmed up really quickly in the hot, hot room. Service at Union is good especially considering how busy the place is.   Dinner, two starters, two mains & four glasses of wine totalled out to $107.00 before tip which for such a hot spot I felt was very reasonable. We didn't order up any dessert because I think at that point we just needed to get outside for some fresh air. I look forward to trying Union again, this time on a cool fall evening."}
{"text":"After going to several joints which proclaimed to have the best Eggs Benedict in the city, my verdict is that Union, hands down, has the best - their BBQ rib benny is the most delectable brunch dish I have EVER HAD!! Plus, great service, decor, coffee, and fresh + local ingredients... definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"There are bigger and more fancier restaurant bars in Toronto but this is on top of my list. The staff is super friendly, the crowd is local and unpretentious and the food is great. I love their Union Salad."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Probably the best steak and ribs ever and leave room for the crispy delicate fries. JW"}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed his ribs, but I didn't care for my chicken all that much.  It seems like you have to know what to order if you want to have a great dinner experience.  I'd probably try the restaurant again, but if I had another bad meal I wouldn't go back.  Unless you have a better option (like something recommended by a local or a friend), this is a place worth trying for dinner."}
{"text":"I was very excited to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday.  I love the idea of farm to table and local, season ingredients.  Unfortunately, the fantasy ended here.  What coloured the entire night was the no-so-great (I'm trying to be kind) service.  The waitress seemed lovely.  That is until she forgot to bring us water.  Then she forgot the extra cutlery we requested.  And at the end of the night, we waited for a good 10-15 minutes for her to collect our cash, only to be told that we should get change at the front.  I can only assume she also forgot our order, because we waited an entire hour to receive our main dishes.  She did offer us a refill of wine on the house for the wait, which was a nice gesture (not considering that it was given to us with a cold look and a mumbled comment).      To be fair, the food was not bad.  But it was not nearly impressive enough for us to get over the long wait on the chilly patio.  The best things we had were the wine and the fries with aioli.  When you consider that our main dishes were around $30 each, that's not a good sign."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Union is very cozy :) I'd recommend the steak hache & elk sliders. SO good - meat was very tender and juicy. The display of the food was nicely put together as well. The union salad was delicious. There was a proportionate amount of dressing so it didn't wash out the taste.  The service was great. I'll definitely recommend this restaurant to others and will visit again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived at Union a few days after it opened. The place was empty. Nice, we would get a table. Or so we thought. Talking to the host, who was quite friendly, he explained they were totally booked for the night. And for much of the week. This place just opened. What? We decided to come back in two weeks.  And so last night we went back. The same host seated us, explained the kitchen was still trying to sort out some kinks, took our drink orders, and left us to enjoy the ambiance of the place. Union is a nice looking restaurant. It feels like a really nice bistro. It's been under construction for something like a million years. For whatever reasons I don't quite know, it's also one of the most hyped up places ever, apparently.   The wine list is short, and the prices are quite reasonable. There are a few beers on tap. The dinner menu is also fairly short, and features a selection of dishes made with locally sourced ingredients. When we were there elk was featured, as was pork belly. Rhubarb was in both mains. I imagine this will change from week to week if not day to day. Everything on the menu sounded pretty good. Prices weren't astronomical, also a plus.  I'm glad to say the reputation it's earned in such a short time is well deserved. The food was great. The service was particularly good. The place was packed by the time we left, always a good sign.  The restaurant is new, and it's clear there are some kinks they need to work out. Getting the food out to the tables seemed a bit slow. Other than that, I have no real complaints. (I also don't really mind waiting a bit for good food.)   This place is well worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday with a reservation and still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Oh well... Had a drink at the bar and everyone tending to us was more than pleasant. We were seated and the waitress ran down the specials and details -- there's not a lot of seating at this place so it's easy to devote time to one table, which is a nice feeling.  The food isn't overly expensive. I started with a house salad that came with goat cheese and what appeared to be like a hash brown ball. It was delicious. Sampled a variety of cheeses and meats as well.  I like the look of this place. The decor is nice and cozy, but it's also quite cramped in there as well. Not much space between tables. Oh, and there's only one washroom! One for men and one for women... That might fly on a slow night but I went down there and had to wait 10-15 minutes for whoever was destroying the men's toilet to come out. Luckily if you just want to wash your hands they have a sink outside in the hallway.  Nice place. I can't complain because the food was good and the service was even better. Those are the two most important things for me, so maybe I will come back when I find out when their slow nights take place."}
{"text":"Two things blow me away about this place: the amazing patio and the customer service.  I hadn't anticipated how lovely the patio. It's  such a difference from the facade. It's one of those things that unless you've heard or read something about it you'd never guess.  Before opening on weekends, the place has a line. The food is fresh and made to order so those lines do to a degree slow the kitchen if you're one of those on the early line.  Is the food worth the wait? Yes, actually the dish I had, the Swiss train was we found too salty but the mushroom dish was delicious.  Really awesome server made the wait worthwhile.   Love to sit in the back and enjoy a lazy afternoon there!"}
{"text":"What an experience! Sat at the food prep bar and conversed with the sous chef Robyn who was real nice and shared her story with us. The chef is young and talented with nouvelle cuisine. We had the prixe fix and well worth it. The duck confit was terrific. The menu changes daily and everything is organic and bought from local farmers. A must try for something different."}
{"text":"Liked the concept, atmosphere and the oysters, but it wasn't very good value and the mains were just ok"}
{"text":"An intimate, understated space with a brick-walled interior and just the right amount of Ossington cool.  Overall, the food was very good. We got the terrine and cheese plate, moroccan soup, pear/chevre salad and sticky ribs...and the portions were very generous! No room for dessert, unfortch. P.S. Sticky ribs were ridiculously tender.  We'd go back...especially on a Monday night, when bottles of wine are half price :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I ate in the patio in the back. My friend ordered halibut. It tasted a bit bland. I had the fish tartare and it was extremely filling and flavourful. Staff are really nice."}
{"text":"food was tasty (scallops, tuna and hache). service was slow. drinks were well made. Ambiance is perfect. this is what I expect from a Ossington bar. Recommend it...."}
{"text":"My friend and I showed up at Union for their \"Paris-style\" Sunday night special. We opted for the $35 for any two (of the four) courses. The other option is $50 for four courses.   There was quite a bit of choice within each course, which was nice.   I picked the GRILLED MACKEREL WITH PICKLED CARROTS, BEETS AND CREME FRAICHE for my starter. The combination of fish, pickled root veggies and creme was just perfect. I thought the creme fraiche complemented the fish well.   My friend's BEET RISOTTO starter was so lovely. It was rich and velvety. My friend was all over it, commenting on how delicious it was with every bite (no joke).   I can't resist a good pappardelle. For my main, I picked the PAPPARDELLE WITH MUSSELS, CLAMS AND LOBSTER. It was in a amazing herb and garlic oil. It was light, but simultaneously so flavourful! I was also impressed with the nice chunks of lobster.   My friend picked the ROAST BEEF WITH ROASTED ROOT VEGGIES AND SCALLOPED POTATOES. Amazing roast beef. I loved that they left chunks of fat for a fatty-meat-lover like myself (and my friend...who actually ordered the entree). And oh my, those scalloped potatoes were something else. Came to our table in a ramekin bowl HOT...really, really hot. It was brilliant and so silky. This ain't no health food and it was damn good.   I really appreciate the portions at Union. These aren't morsels, but a good amount that left me feeling satisfied.   The tables are a bit tight at Union, which, if full, would be a bit uncomfortable, especially if you're on a date.   I will definitely be going back. For the duck confit. Count on it."}
{"text":"Love Union! If you can't get a reservation, they do have bar/kitchen tabletop seating that is on first-come basis.  Menu is pretty good, changes weekly. The steak and sliders are some of our favourites. Would recommend checking out if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We have visited Union many times we frequently pre-order the cou de bouef and charcuterie with frois gras it has never been a disappointment! There is nothing we have ever ordered there that was not spot on  Monday nights they have half price wine! The staff is amazing the decor is casual but polished! One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Grey hunks of liver ,greasy potatoes .Burgers of farm raised elk are safely popular.the' creature' of the evening was Pork Tonnato: a fatty slab of pork smothered in an abomination of yellowish weird tasting goop( apologies to Marcella Hazan).Ordinary steak.Fey service.Wine list spare with sophisto plonk. Grotty looking patio. Good drinks."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the violinist and accordionist sitting at the bar, visible from Union's beautiful glass windows, we would have passed this place by. The sign outside invited us in for a Sunday bohemian brunch, so our curiosity lead the way. We entered just as the duo began an Amélie piece, and I was instantly entranced.   Their Sunday brunch menu is served until 3pm along with Anthony Wing (of Pure Spirit Oyster bar fame) serving up fresh oysters. The menu was different from that listed online, with some seasonal additions. We had the cheese plate, flat top breakfast and about a dozen oysters. The cheese plate came with three types of cheese (hard sheep, hard cow, soft blue) and a chunk of honeycomb that we enjoyed squeezing honey out of. The flat top came with delicious habanero sausage that they make in-house and potato rosti done just right. The oysters were a delight; we had half-a-dozen Colville Bay and another saltier Atlantic type that hit the spot. Union makes this lemon-infused Scottish Bonnet vodka that went well with the saltier oysters, and Anthony gave us a nice vinaigrette to pair with the Colville Bays. He returns on the half-off wine Mondays, which is a bonus to those who also enjoy oysters for dinner.   The wait staff was a tad stand-off-ish and took some time to set our table, even though there were clearly 5 available spots to choose from as we arrived late in the afternoon. All-in-all, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, especially with the gypsy/french music and beautiful decor. The food was top-notch. I can't wait to return for dinner and be further impressed. This is definitely one of my top 3 Ossington restaurants."}
{"text":"Even with the easy accessibility of something called the \"Internet\", neither Vivek nor I knew that our original dinner spot was closed on a Tuesday night. Luckily, we weren't too far away from Ossington Street where there are a handful of great restaurants including our second best choice, Union.   We walked in and it looked seemingly empty but that changed in about a half hour. Even if it was Tuesday night, they do prefer you make a reservation.   As we sat at the bar (personally, all of the best action happen at the bar, in front of the open kitchen) we perused through the menu. The list of appetizers looked impressive but it was elk sliders that caught our eye. Without a doubt, they are a must-try. These buttered balls of game meat goodness are cooked medium rare, topped with a pickle, on triangle-shaped challah toast. Eating them required some hand manoeuvring because the meat will naturally fall to your plate because you aren't sure to eat small bites of the toast first or stuff the whole thing at once into your mouth. But every morsel of it is worth it the effort.  While Vivek had the pork chop, I ordered the Union Burger. With the longest description on the menu, it had me with the words 'cooked medium rare'. Every bite had the most amazing array of flavour, from the juicy meat, to the bacon and cheddar to the soft bread that wrapped it. My only sadness is that I couldn't finish my plate. Along with the delicious frites and a mustardy-aioli sauce, I tried my hardest to finish everything but I was defeated.    I would suggest coming here on Tuesdays: you can't go wrong with half priced bottles of wine and their wine list is a good one. However I do apologize to anyone who was there that night and wanted to try the Gewürztraminer, which happened to be the last bottle there. I can tell you that it was delicious.   I fully agree with Vivek that the service we received was impeccable. No one rushed us nor dotted over us. We were able to sit, enjoy and digest our meals at our own pace."}
{"text":"A harmony of expertly baked fish and creamy cutting broth.   The Atlantic cod sits atop a bed of slightly undercooked lentils and kale, soaking in a creamy peppered lake.   Soft Lemmon pepper juice drips off a healthy chunk of cod. Succulence is an understatement. The cod, which still retains its original fresh caught plumpness, clings to this creamy broth with the crisp dry exterior the oven heat has blessed'ed upon thee.    The dense meatyness. The slicing pepper lemon moat. Crispy lentils and soaked kale. A complex harmony of dense and light.   Also the negroni was v lit."}
{"text":"Dined at Union last night to celebrate a birthday -- and was very impressed.  They make no great claims and over delivered in a big way.  We were lucky in that it was a beautiful evening and we, party of four, was able to sit outdoors on the lovely patio.  Food standouts included grilled octopus, leeks in herbed vinaigrette, arctic char with beets, and a wonderful aged steak with frites.  We shared all plates and everyone was more than pleased.  Nice cocktails too, especially an unusual white negroni. Great service.  We certainly will return. Simple fate done very well."}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant. Great space. Effortlessly casual. Free-drawn mural covering one expanse of the wall. Open-kitchen.   Menu is startlingly small, but it's not about quantity. Nearly half of the menu changes according to what's available at the markets that day. Chef Teo Paul's dedication to fresh and local.  Outstanding dishes:  Sticky ribs: pork ribs on the bone with smoked & bruised pork belly  (If you like ribs. love ribs. lukewarm about ribs. hell, even if you hate ribs. You MUST try. Sauce. Ridiculously good. That's all)  Fresh fish: White fish w/ roasted vegetables & seasonal greens  (Succulently flaky, moist, tender, and boldly-seasoned. Rarely used for fish, but it fits. And the roasted vegetables...perfect accompaniment)  Honourable mentions:  Elk sliders w/ miran galangal glaze & pickle on challah  (Meaty & juicy with a bite from the pickled pickle. Slight disappointment with the toast - think high end hamburger bun, visual letdown)  Sides: Frites & winter-style potatoes w/ yogurt, radish & chives  (3/4 of the way through our meal - surprise! oh my. just perfect for dipping into that sweet, slightly spicy, wickedly good rib sauce)"}
{"text":"How I wanted to love Union.. I was so sure I'd adore this quaint little French wine bar after taking a peek at 4 star rating and the menu.. and I did, but only the apps.  The mains disappointed me after I made the trek down to my favourite area of Toronto.  The service was great, and we were offered to sit outside on the patio.  It was a little chilly that day so we opted to sit inside, decor was pretty retro and in line with the overall hipster feel of Ossington, I liked it a lot  The apps were delectable. Elk Sliders - toasted challah, mirin galangal glaze & pickles.  I usually hate pickles with a passion, but paired with the elk and the challah (a type of Jewish braided bread)... best sliders I ever had hands down.  Juicy and flavourful, with honey on top of the elk.  Unf.    Seared Diver Scallops - this item wasn't on the menu on the site, and I'm so disappointed because I really wanted to list all the ingredients here!  This was the most unique scallops dish I had.  The scallops were served in a plate of cornmeal with a hint of spice and also some kind of berry sauce.  SO GOOD.  That's all.  The mains disappointed us... I ordered the sticky ribs based on the raved reviews by fellow Yelpers.  This was charcoal smoked and braised back ribs in homemade BBQ sauce.    That BBQ sauce was just way.  Too.  Sweet.  That's really the only thing wrong with this dish, the bed of veggies were cooked nicely and even the ribs itself had a great texture, but the sauce.. overpoweringly and almost nauseatingly sweet.  I almost couldn't finish :(   The steak frites was another much raved dish in the reviews here.  Again.. we were disappointed.  It was Scotch Mountain NY strip served med-rare,with hotel butter and some greens.  There was way too much fat in the steak, and really.. it was good steak, but not great steak.  It tasted too average to be a signature dish of the resto.  The fries mimicked the flavouring of McD's but a bit too oily for my taste.    Tbh, I might consider coming back here again and giving Union another shot.  Only because the appetizers were so winning."}
{"text":"Looking at the menu at Union Restaurant and I asked the waiter \"why does everything have pork, any way we can remove/substitute it?\", and he responds in a condensing way \"because we are in North America?\".. At that point, I picked myself up, paid for my coffee, and walked away. I guess this restaurant doesn't want to serve a diverse crowd where some commit to follow a dietary restriction whether out of religious or personal choice."}
{"text":"Bravo, Union! Perfection.  I had recently come to believe that there was a lack of *great* dining in Toronto~ At least to my particular taste. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of *very good* dining out there, but something always fell a little short.  Until last night.  When a couple of old-standbys were closed for the evening, I wound up making a reservation for Union at the Chef's bar (An indulgence that my boyfriend and I adore). We spend a lot of time in California, and are spoiled by the locavore fare. It 's not as easy to come by in Canada, so when we saw that Union was farm-to-table, we were immediately impressed. This also means the menu changes frequently, based on what's available. My boyfriend accurately pointed out that this requires absolute confidence and skill from a chef...  Everything- I mean everything- we ate was perfect. I love a good prix-fixe (yet another checkmark!) and all the portions were very generous. The Elk sliders were delicious, the crab risotto, smoky and and creamy. For our mains, I had the halibut on black beans and he chose the rabbit dijonnaise. Both were presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. The rabbit, served with wilted greens & some of the best frites I've had anywhere, was the rich, succulent, star of the evening. That was, until dessert. The cheese platter contained 2 of the best cheeses I've ever tasted and a bit of clover honeycomb. To say that the pairing was divine, is an understatement. Combined with the delicious champagne, I left with a huge grin and a full, happy, belly. I had finally found a cozy, welcoming, unpretentious, food-home in Toronto.   I will add, the tab was entirely reasonable for what we enjoyed. I've spent more, elsewhere, for food that was far inferior. The decor was warm, inviting, and comfortable. The only thing I can think of, all evening, that was less than perfect, was that the chairs and subsequent space at the chef's table were not meant for people much taller than my 5\"4 inches. My companion needed to contort himself a fair bit in order to fit; However, he magically seemed to forget about his discomfort as soon as the food was in front of him...  The service was superb. All of the staff were very knowledgeable, friendly and approachable. It was Mother's day, and we learned that a few of the dishes on offer for the evening were 'Mom's favourites' of the staff. Sweet. And the pecan pie (which we overheard described as \"perfection\" and \"the best ever\" ) was one of their mother's home recipes. A fitting tribute.  I am already planning a return visit. I. Can't. Wait. Thank-you, thank-you, Union!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Only been for brunch, but food and service was top notch. Havent had dinner yet, but looks great. definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the frittata for brunch, it is an Italian egg based dish similar to a quiche. It came on a bed of salad and a hash.  I didn't really enjoy the frittata; I think the chef may have put a bit too much salt in my dish, because it was very very salty. It was interesting because the top part of the frittata was delicious, but the base of it was too salty. I also like how there were some jalapeño slices on top of the frittata to give it another texture as well as taste. I thought the hash was made perfectly and it tasted really well, and the salad help accompanied the frittata.  My friends ordered other dishes (such as the Benny) and really liked it. I will consider going again, but will not be ordering the frittata."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations given the 4/5 star reviews but honestly, I wasn't too impressed given all the hype! We arrived for brunch and given the popularity, we were lucky to be sat at the bar. The place is small but the atmosphere is hip and cozy. I believe their menu changes often but I felt that I didn't really have anything on the menu I particularly felt inclined to which was disappointing. I ended up trying the Swiss Train Ride which was swiss cheese, egg and ham on a toast with potato rosti. Food was good but honestly, not sure if it was worth  the price and wasn't anything particularly special. Overall, 3.5/4 but I would definitely come and give this place another go for dinner before I make a final decision."}
{"text":"Service is friendly. Horrible place for food, seriously anyone can cook better. The ingredients are supposed to be organic and fresh but what good is that if you can cook properly? Food has no style, it's basically your lower than average homecooking."}
{"text":"Good ambience, great lighting, unfortunately the ventilation system wasn't working well and we left smelling like the kitchen.   Service was inconsistent, skipped a starter as nothing looked appealing. La Bourride was delicious and unique (halibut cheeks, haddock and clams in a tomato broth and finished with aioli), the steak frites was tasty other than the frites being cold - which I took off my plate and mentioned to the server. There was no service recovery and for a $30 plate which consisted of steak, frites and a piece of bok choy I expected some acknowledgement.   The sticky ginger pudding was good, the rhubarb crumble was pasty. For 2 people eating two mains and two desserts, with a great bottle of wine the bill came to $210 - definitely didn't get value for our money."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice lighting - dining room gets really loud tho.   Excellent food. The charcuterie plate and steak tartare are outstanding."}
{"text":"Probably more like a 3.5 to 3.75. I had the sticky ribs. They come on a bed of black kale with carrots on the side and caramelized tomato/bbq onions on top, and the ribs were delicious, but honestly, what I'm thinking about the day after are the carrots. They were prepared simply, just with butter and salt, but I couldn't stop eating them. My friend had the whitefish and holy hell, it was good, as were the baby shiitakes he got on the side. (So good he got a side order of mushrooms, though they weren't as good as the mushrooms that appeared on his original plate.) As is my wont, I got the grapefruit cocktail. It was kind of cloying and a little bitter, but what else do you expect from a cocktail with Campari in it?    Atmosphere was really nice. It's cool and quite beautiful in there, and service was friendly though it took a while to get our bill (it was Friday night and busy).  Two mains, a side, two cocktails and a beer got us to $110 before tip. Cocktails here are expensive, about $15 each, but that seems to be a new normal.  I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  Wow...this is the best restaurant I have been to in a while! I was in Toronto visiting for the weekend (I used to live here though) and had the pleasure of going to Union with some friends to catch up. The place is really great, our server was super nice, full of great suggestions, and she definitely knows her wine!   We got Elk Sliders for an appetizer with our wine and wow...it has been 3 days and I still can't get over how amazingly delicious they were! You MUST try the Elk Sliders! So tender, flavorful, juicy, covered in sauce on a delicious piece of bread, and it just melts in your mouth! It's an excellent melange of flavors! YUM!  It is a bit expensive there, especially some of their wines, so be prepared for a fatty bill at the end of stay, but it's well worth it if you want some delicious drinks and food. It was packed on Friday night and food took a little bit longer than we had anticipated, but it was worth it once the sliders and ribs came out. This is an excellent place for a date or to just catch up with friends..I would love to come back again some day because I have not had enough of their sliders. Did I mention you should try the Elk Sliders? ;) haha."}
{"text":"Great lunch or dinner place in vibrant neighborhood   Mostly local and organic food  Cool vibe"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my gf, made reservations pretty lady minute and got a table at chefs table.. I want sure what to get so I asked the chef, he was very informative and told us what are the hits at the restaurant.. All I have to say is that I'm definitely going back.. Good was amazing and love the atmosphere.. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Elk sliders and Sticky Ribs are the signature dishes...definitely worth trying. Good Canadian soul food."}
{"text":"Union never disappoints. Came here for brunch multiple times after attending spin classes in the area. Their pulled pork egg bennies dish is always a good idea!  Finally got a chance to come here for dinner on a Friday night. We heard a lot of good reviews about their burger but it wasn't on the dinner menu that day. So we asked the server about it and they were willing make it for us. We were very excited and the burger was truly amazing. It also came with a side of fries and the portion was quite generous.   I would definitely come back again and try other dishes on the menu!  P.s. if you like to see what's popular or how the food looks before ordering, ask to sit at the chef's table!"}
{"text":"After wanting to try Union for some time now, I treated and took a friend here for a late brunch today.  We arrived just after 1 pm and were seated right away.   Wow...why did I wait so long to finally try Union...   We started off our meal by sharing the Steak Tartare which was served with butter pickles, two mustards, habanero and four servings of toast.  Although just enough to share between two people, next time I may just order this as an app all for myself.  Some people noted it was bland; I ate every bite of the tartare with a tiny hint of the condiments it was served with, and with a bite of toast.  Tasty flavour combinations which all worked well together, even surprisingly with a pickle; definitely got our palates wanting more.    We both ordered the BBQ Rib Benny: smoked pulled ribs, poached eggs, hollandaise, greens and rosti. This was now my favourite eggs benny plate...the one to beat...my friend agreed.  Loved every bite of this plate.  I will definitely come back and also try dinner; sounds like I must try the elk sliders and ribs next.  Thank you for the great service and amazing food today, Union."}
{"text":"Excellent across the board: service, atmosphere, apps, mains, desserts, wine list, beer taps, cocktail menu.  This could be my favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Union was one of my favorite dinners recently for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, the food was terrific. Fresh, local ingredients, interesting options, healthy portions and terrific execution all came together for a perfect experience. Informal décor, cool vibe and really awesome front and back bars.  Our starters included the fried smelts, a wild mushroom tartiniette, and a local apple and cheese salad. The smelts were crispy and delicious, paired with an amazing dill cream sauce and salad. The apple and cheese salad was fresh, vibrant and a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The true standout for me was the tartinette. Sautéed wild mushrooms over a fresh, molasses brown bread with a garlic butter sauce. Rich, layered and satisfying - it's something I hope to see on the menu for future visits.  For my main I opted for the smoked pork and beef lasagna. I was a little apprehensive but it was viscerally satisfying. It arrived to the table still bubbling in a hot ramekin swimming in tomato sauce, dripping with cheese and piled with fresh basil. A phenomenal contemporary take on an Italian classic."}
{"text":"dinner or brunch, they arent fuckin around. get a seat at the bar to see how they put it all together. service is nice/efficient, but they get busy and dont have many seats. make a reservation! menu changes often."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I dined here, but my experience was good enough that I'm still thinking about this place.   A friend and I came on a Saturday night without a reservation and they were able to seat us at the chef's bar right away. I usually don't care to sit at any sort of bar as I'm very tall and it's rarely comfortable for me. But the chefs bar at Union is comfortable, and positions you between the dining room and kitchen--perfect to watch the chefs working their magic and taking in the restaurant's warm, comfortable, thoughtfully executed ambiance. Sometimes I like to use steak frites as a benchmark for comparison between different restaurants; it's always interesting to see how places flavor/prepare their steak and frites. Both were delicious here. Elk sliders were also yummy."}
{"text":"This is the cutest French bistro styled restaurant. All food is homemade, the Polenta Gratin is to die for!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Union is a nice, small and cozy restaurant that I would recommend. The food was good but nothing amazing. The two items that stood out compared to the others were the Elk Sliders and the Sticky Ribs.   Elk Sliders - 4/5 (Very flavorful and juicy) Union Salad - 3.5/5 (Pretty plain in my opinion. Was not impressed) Steak Tartare - 4/5 (Good but nothing amazing) Sticky Ribs - 4/5 (Very tender and flavorful) Side fries - 4/5 (Reminded me of my childhood when my parents brought me to McDonalds. I might have had more than a couple glasses of wine by this time)  Overall, definitely a good place for a night out!"}
{"text":"Union definitely has a lot of pluses -  a neat location, great decor, but based on the price I wasn't overly impressed.    We made a reservation, but they got their numbers confused so we ended up sitting at the bar right by the door - definitely not comfortable.  It made service slow too because we were out of the way of the main service.  Food was yummy but not out of this world.  Elk sliders were great.  Soup of the day was so so.  My main chicken entree was good, but not great.  Everyone gets sides of french fries and potato salad which were OK.  I'd certainly be willing to give these guys another chance, because I think there's potential there."}
{"text":"About a year ago I walked past this restaurant while wandering around Toronto and Immediately regretted not walking through those doors. Recently I have undone that wrong and was glad of it.  Service was pleasant and the prices were appropriate for the quality of the food.  It started off with the elk sliders. At first glance i wasn't sure how I felt about the dish; balls of elk meat situated a top of unassuming bread and a nuclear orange cheese. I also wasn't sure how I felt about the combination of pickles and honey. These hesitations were quickly dashed upon my first bite. The flavor combinations were glorious. It was a traditional hamburger, but elevated.   The menu is packed with an impressive assortment of meats for such a small menu. Oddly enough it was the Sautéed morels that caught my attention. Being one of the few vegetarian dishes I had to see if it could up to its meaty brethren.  It's strange. I hate mushrooms. I have no idea why I'd choose a mushroom-centric dish. It must have been divine intervention because it sure tasted like it. Served almost like a stew, I was expecting a salty broth, but instead was met with a thoughtfully composed earthy flavor with slight accents of lemon zest and acidic greens. It was a sleeper hit to my evening of restaurant hopping. Be warned though, if you were expecting big flavors, you won't find it in this dish. It is delicate, but by no means a dish to take lightly.  To wrap things up the ginger cake was the next item on the table. Think sticky toffee pudding, but with a distinct taste of ginger and allspice. It was an absolute delight. Capped with an awesome cocktail, my experience at Union was nothing short of stellar. If you need a restaurant to check out while waiting for the line at Bang Bang to die down, this is the perfect establishment."}
{"text":"Only went for wine but the food that was served to other customers looked fantastic. Definitely want to try the Elk Sliders next time."}
{"text":"The beef tartar appetizer was very good, and generous.  The Union salad was a hit too.  The elk sliders were not bad, so long as you don't think of Bambi.  But the sauce was too sweet.     For the mains, the Steak frits was a hit, as were the sticky ribs.  The fish was also very good.  Wine list was very short, but not too expensive, and quite good.  A few minor complaints: There was little thought given to the presentation.  Good food deserves good presentation.  The service was only up-to-par, but nothing exceptional.  The room is way too narrow with kitchen staff passing back and forth constantly.    All said, it was a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and will keep coming back! It was amazing both times. The steak tartare is delicious, steak haché with french fries is really good too. I would recommend trying at least one of the fish dishes they offer, and ask for a wine suggestion as they know some great pairings with their dishes. It's pretty cool to sit at the chef's table and watch the kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent spit for lunch particularly in the summer on the lovely patio. Short rib was perfect. Service is good."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto so far!!!  The decor is perfect.  I love sitting at the bar checking out all the action in the kitchen.  Their outdoor patio is cozy.  The service is great.  The staff not only provides impeccable service but they give you the right amount of social interaction without being annoying or impersonal.  The food is without a doubt delicious.  The steak tartare is my favourite in the world, their ribs melt in your mouth, and their NY style cheesecake is prob better then any I have had in NYC. The pre-fixe menu on Sunday is definitely reminiscent of a Paris bistro, which is so comforting when you're so far from one of the greatest cities in the world.  This is a must go place, but expect a wait without a reservation on Fri/ Sat.  They also have brunch on the weekends, which I hear is fabulous and I can't wait to check out next."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite spots for a simple drink, brunch or dinner.  The steak tartare is definitely one of my favourite in the city!  It's a small spot, intimate and great to chat with friends or even on a date.  Love that it is farm to table cuisine!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails and enjoyed the elk sliders. Asked the bartender for recommendations of what to see with 1 day in Toronto, and he curated a list from the whole staff for us!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!  Holy hell the fried polenta with poached eggs are to die for.  Coffee is perfection.  Food came out fast but service was not nearly attentive enough.  It's Sunday afternoon, I obviously need more than one puny cup of coffee.  But the food was really delicious and it's a cool space too."}
{"text":"we started off with the elk sliders which were perfectly prepared for my liking. juicy n' bloody on the inside and crisp on the outside. The risotto trout fillet was so so. The risotto was too creamy and didn't go well with the fish as I would have thought. reservations are necessary seating is limited and place is normally packed. It's an elegant  and intimate atmosphere but can get really loud. Nice spot on the Ossington"}
{"text":"Brunch and Dinner, I've eaten at Union a number of times and I've never left disappointed.  The ingredients are local, fresh and delicious and the hands in the open-air kitchen cook everything to perfection.  My personal favourite was the Côte de Buf for two, a gorgeous single rib cut of aged beef that was large enough to feed us twice.  The menu changes due to the nature of ingredients' availability, but if you happen to come across the sausages on the brunch menu, jump at the chance to tuck into these house-made treats."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Food was excellent. Had some oysters and a couple seafood apps. They were really large and my wife and I were Almost full. The mains were also good.  I had steak frites which had great flavour but was under cooked!  My wife had the ribs which were really tasty.   The only complaint is that the place is jammed and the tables are right next to each other , much like Paris. So quite loud and hard to have a conversation.    Otherwise I enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"Elk sliders oh my, delicious little bites of sweet meaty goodness. The matsutake Crudo was light and fresh and The tagliatelle ragu was ok. Thank goodness I came tonight."}
{"text":"Very trendy and cool venue located in the heart of the Ossington strip. However, this establishment is lacking in food quality... I ordered the Union salad and all it was just huge salad leaves with a latka kind of potato cube and a bit of some sort of cream cheese. I also ordered the tagliatelle con frutti di mare and it was more of a mussel soup with tagliatelle. The tagliatelle were way overcooked (the noodle was just falling apart) and there was too much sauce which appeared like a soup. Would not come back."}
{"text":"You'd think two elite yelpers like Steph C and I would know to check the hours on Yelp before setting off for dinner. Sheesh. After standing outside our first -- and closed -- choice with our jaws agape and our eyes slightly misty (dust or something) we quickly regained our resolve and marched down Ossington in search of dinner.  As luck would have it, neither of us had been to Union. Located on the west side of Ossington just south of Delux, it's a few steps up into this charming space. There is a bar right at the front, which acts as a host's table and I spotted an espresso machine here also. Behind this miniature cafe is the restaurant proper. It's long and filled with tables. There is a marble bar at the back that encircles the kitchen, giving you a great view of the action.  When we requested a table for two our host sucked air between his teeth and frowned slightly. The restaurant was virtually empty. After perusing the reservations list carefully, he offered us either \"the worst seat in the house\" (my attribution, not his) or a spot at the bar. Easy choice. Long story short, they'll like you better if you have a reservation.   That said, the service was fairly solid. No fewer than three staff members reminded us that it was Talk it Over Tuesday, which meant we could grab a bottle of Gewurtztraminer (or any wine) for half price. And thought it did eventually get busy (who can resist half-price vino?) we never felt rushed or doted upon.  The foods on the menu are all locally sourced and a chalk-written list of their sources is visible in the kitchen. Even without reading all the reviews, both Steph and I gravitated towards the elk sliders. It's a meatball-sized morsel of elk on top of toasted challah crowned with a  pickle. And as others have noted, they are pretty phenomenal.  My habenero glazed pork chop served with roast asparagus and yellow zucchini was cooked perfectly (pork chops can somtimes come out really dry) and the portion size was decent. Steph got the Union Burger which looked like a winner also. I can't wait to come back, which thanks to their check-in offer, will be to collect a free appetizer at lunch. Score!  Obligatory Title Pun: Don't secede from these UNION.  Menu Readability: For something created using a standard typeface and slathered with hyphens as rules, it's quite nice actually.  Need to mention: Impressive wine list.  What this place teaches me about myself: Apparently I *will* visit a union shop."}
{"text":"Union is just one of those places for me that serves so many purposes. Delicious but casual afternoon lunch? Yes. Glass of wine on the back patio? Yes. Cheese board and half price bottle on Monday night with a girlfriend? Definitely. Special occasion dinner? Duh.   Most recently I stopped in for a quick-ish lunch with coworkers on a Friday afternoon. As a vegetarian I am always happy to see more than one enticing non-meat item on the menu and today was no exception. I ordered the polenta, which was served with spicy tomato sauce, carrot, kale, and tomme de savoie cheese. It was filling and rich but not overwhelmingly so. I also ordered a glass of wine because Friday. The dish would probably have been best with a glass of red, but I was really craving white and our server recommended a nice crisp Sancerre which cut some of the richness of the meal."}
{"text":"Really great spot for brunch. We came just as they opened, and were seated in their outdoor patio. We had the Union Salad, and the BBQ Rib Benny - both were delicious! The freshly squeezed Mimosas were fantastic too. Would give 5 stars if it weren't for the cost of everything!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. I came here with 7 others last Sunday for dinner. The service was great, the food was tasty. The smoked salmon app was a hit. I really liked my crudo beef tartar, really good. The morel pasta was excellent. Mixed reviews about the duck confit- someone said it tasted too fatty. Desserts were solid too, I got the creme brule. The rhubarb dessert was just a tad sweet. Otherwise excellent meal. Would recc and return. Not a 5 star experience because of the minor minor issues. Overall everyone liked the meal. Very good for $40."}
{"text":"Wow... If ppl thought this was a great place.... Please go and visit Portland variety or Cibo or any other place in king west.   Union was by far the worst French place I have ever been to, and I feel like shit after eating their crap.   The only thing I liked about them was their service . That's it."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly warm atmosphere (both the staff and patrons), great coffees and cocktails...an always stop for me"}
{"text":"Great brunch place! I've been here a few times for brunch but never for dinner. The steak tartare is the best tartare I've had and it's sourced locally. A must-try for sure! I think everything is locally sourced which makes it all the better."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here under the recommendation of my parent's old sous chef and boss. I suppose I'll start with the positives: the concept and set-up of this restaurant were quite cute, fitting in nicely with the \"hipster\" Ossington vibe. The elk sliders to start were also fairly pleasant. Unfortunately, the fun ended when our mains came. My partner ordered a steak haché, which basically ended up being a deconstructed and bland well-cooked hamburger. I ordered a duck \"marget\" (verbatim from the menu; great to see a French restaurant doubling up on their spell-check) that, while cooked nicely, must have come from the leanest duck in the world. I've eaten my fair share of duck in my relatively short life, and it should never be a chore to chew. We abstained from ordering dessert after this because we, quite frankly, wanted to leave. Our sorrowful meal could have at least been made more pleasant by the service. Unfortunately, our mustachioed server was quite obviously distant and inattentive to our table because we hadn't dropped enough coin to buy copious amounts of overpriced wine at his restaurant. Gimme a break, dude; my partner doesn't drink, and I got two glasses of red for like, $28. As an aside, I also didn't quite care for the other diners of this establishment (learn to apply sunscreen, folks) but that's another story. Overall, what more was I expecting from a restaurant in Toronto, really?"}
{"text":"\"Is Union four or five stars?\" \"Union is a five star establishment.\"   He then went on to school me on all of the reasons why, and all of the tasty times we've spent here. I can't believe I ever considered giving one of our go-to havens four stars. How do I love Union? Let me count the ways...  1.) Their brunch menu is a work of art, complete with pickle-juice caesars.  2.) Their back patio is a picnic-tabled joy, complete with a smoker, to perfume your evening 3.)Their meat dishes from ribs to steaks and back again are favourites amongst carnivores I know  4.) Their huge scratch-made, sauce-drenched lasagna  5.) If they're full, and they're often full, sitting at the bar is actually one of the best seats in the house"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly which is why it earned 2 stars!!  The resto is really narrow. With winter jackets and all, it was just uncomfortably tight in there.   Food wasn't impressive. The burger was meh! And the salad was just not good. Drenched in dressing with a lump of goat cheese just goes to show how \"unthoughtful\" it was. I wish it was better cause it's such a good location..."}
{"text":"The best brunch I had in a while!!  We went there during Easter weekend (Sunday), the line was not bad, 5mins.   I first got the expresso, it's all right, not too impressive.   For brunch, I ordered crispy Polenta, it's bomb! The polenta squares are really delicious, with crispy outside and softness and warmth inside! It has a little spicy flavour, so it's not a boring cornmeal cake at all!! The Benny was good, too. The tomato sauce is really taste, not too sour, not too sweet!   My friends ordered seafood omelet, smoke rib Benny and Swiss train ride. They all liked!   Good service, too. :)   Good place to chill."}
{"text":"I recently went to Union for Sunday brunch. I had been to Union many years ago for drinks but had not tried the brunch until now. Located near Ossington and Argyle, Union is a bustling French restaurant serving local farm-to-table fare.   My boyfriend and I arrived for brunch at around 11:30am and the restaurant was slowly seating everyone at staggering times. Smart idea knowing that they did not want to compromise the quality of the service and overwhelm the kitchen. We opted to sit at the chef's table which was facing all the action in the open kitchen (loved it!). We ordered our drinks and got them promptly. For food, my boyfriend ordered the Swiss Train Ride (with Paris ham, Swiss cheese, fried egg, bechamel, and rosti) and I ordered the chorizo scramble (with garlic scapes, blue cheese, and chili jam).  Both dishes were delicious. I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese to begin with but the combinations of flavours just worked. Moreover, the quality of the ingredients spoke in each dish as you could taste how fresh everything was.   Overall, the food came out a bit slow but Union provides a great relaxing environment to have brunch. The vibe and service is friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. Union has definitely become one of my favourite brunch spots after this visit!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, but service was casual and lacking effort : a little too try-hard hip. Brunch Menu was the usual with a few twists. Selected the BBQ Rib Eggs Benedict which was alright. Flavors they featured on the menu were nothing special - in fact pretty mundane for a place open specifically for brunch. Orange juice was a tiny glass and not worth it. The best part was the potato fritter that came on the side."}
