{"text":"Amazing little place. The food is high-end and the design feels so classy and sophisticated. All the owners, servers and bartenders are super nice and promptly make you feel at home. The menu can be a little intimidating (like using the term \"frites\" for \"thin cut fries\") and some times it's hard to understand but both their basic food (ex. chicken wings) and their fancier stuff (ex. egg plant rolls) are delicious. A great place to impress a girl, or her parents ;)"}
{"text":"Almost every single meal I've eaten here has been a delight. (The only mis-step I can recall was the quinoa burger, and veggie burgers are notoriously hard to pull off.) But the service is top-notch, the ambiance is classy but friendly, and the food is always on point. When I ate more meat, I was a big fan of the moules et frites and the fried chicken with spiced honey and collards. Now I'm more likely to order the French onion soup, which always comes thick and jammy, or the fried cauliflower pizza, or one of the specials (of which there are always many). No matter what I order, though, I have to get a Smoked Old Fashioned: made with top-shelf bourbon and served in a glass beaker filled with actual smoke generated with hardwood chips beneath the bar and funnelled up into the beaker. You pour it yourself into a highball with a single ball of ice inside, Japanese style. I've had their other cocktails and they're all good (as is their wine list), but this one's my favourite and it's unlike anything else in the city.   I've come here a bunch of times, but every time I'm back I think I should come more often. It's that kind of place. It's a great feature for the neighbourhood, and both the service and the substance is better than a lot of places downtown offering similar fare. It might be glorified pub food, but it's also *glorious* pub food."}
{"text":"This place has great food. Very consistent I'm quality and staff of friendly. Their Calamari is amazing!  We love dropping by for apps and drinks at this pace. We're never disappointed."}
{"text":"Morgan's has a great atmosphere. Beautiful interior, customer oriented service and a nice selection of beer (though lacking some critical high end staples). The blanche de Chambly mussels were to die for. As a huge mussels fan, I can honestly say they were the best I've ever had. The entree was a little bland, after providing that feedback after the meal, the staff was insistent on doing whatever it took to make sure we left pleased with our night out at their new establishment. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We love the food here! Especially the sticky toffee cake and poutine! Atmosphere is very nice with adjustable lighting if you get a booth."}
{"text":"I have been to Morgan's a few times now and it is definitely one of my favourite spots in Toronto! Great variety of food and very reasonable prices. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Great place to go on a date or with a few friends."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to make the long trek to Morgan's for date night after not being able to make time for some quiet time together. So on this somewhat special date night, we thought \"ah! Morgan's, nice atmosphere this is going to be superb!\"  ...BOY WERE WE WRONG.  My partner ordered the burger (no cheese, basic tomatoes, lettuce and onion) and a side of chicken wings. I had ordered the beet salad with the fried chicken and  mash on the side.  THE FOOD WAS TERRIBLE. THE WAIT WAS FOREVER (when it was pretty empty)  The Hoisin and Medium wings were great, was kind enough to accomodate by having mixed flavours...but seemed adamant. As for my beet salad...boy was that a beating to my wallet (haha...) it was a wilted mixed greens salad with any old vinaigrette dressing with the most MINISCULE beet slice i have EVER seen. I dind't know beets were so high demand and expensive that the slices were no bigger than my thumbprint and no thicker than a piece of thin wilted packing box cardboard! The whole salad had a total of maybe 6 slices (i'm generously counting because i consciously only remember eating maybe 4 slices after trying to pick through and find some.)  After seeing the chef/cook or whoever was in the kitchen pick up take-out from an outside source, my partner and i knew something was WRONG.  My partner's burger was dry and flavourless, the bun was dry enough to make breadcrumbs with. When telling the waitress (who by all means was busy chatting with the bartender for most of the night instead of paying attention to customer needs); she questioned what was wrong with it when my partner had left a huge at the least 1inch dry outter ring of the top crust of the burger (because it was left in the oven or whatever for the whole time the burger w as being cooked that it could have been crumbled-made a hollow noise when i tapped it wtih a fork). The menu had stated burgers were cooked t o a medium if not specified...it was WEELLLLL DONE.   As for my fried chicken, waitress was kind e nough to bring me another dipping container of honey. However, the chicken was not bad...very oily and one of the pieces was mainly FRIED FAT. The swiss chard was a salted mop. Imagine taking a mop and dipping it into pavement salt with a bit of water. The cook had clearly NOT tasted any of his own food because it was so salty, even after attempting to mix it into the mashed potatoes WHICH WAS SO DRY THE MASH POTATO CRUMBLED. there was no butter or milk of any sort let alone seasoning in the mashed potatoes. Going back to t he swiss chard, t he bacon was unbelievably over powering; the saltiness dind't help much either.   At the end of our meal, we were dying to leave. We had never been so disappointed with a meal. The atmosphere was what we paid for. If you're looking for good food at a good price, and good service...THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. We had asked for the bill 4 times (once from the male waiter, three times from the female waiter) even then it took super long. They tried to make it up to us by giving us a free dessert for the whole burger problem....but it seemed like a sad effort as it delayed our bill even more and the meal was already TERRIBLE (mind you, we've been to some shady-ass restaurants but this has to be the most disappointing one).   With such a beautiful interior, what a shame to see this place wasted on such crappy ass food with less-than-mediocre service that costs out the ass."}
{"text":"Just finished my second visit at Morgan's and i LOVED it both times.   The first time we had a cheese platter to start, which was fabulous. The menu choices were interesting . We had the scallops appetizer, salad and a burger, which was the best burger every....  The beer menu has some nice choices and of course indulged on the the Blache du Chamblay on tap, which is rare to find  in the city. The staff was very friendly and  attentive. Meal and staff made the experience pleasant which was why we returned with more friends who live on the Danforth for our second visit.   Morgan's again did not disappoint the second time, so not sure what the big fuss was all about with one customers comments???   Our second meal started with the soup-- which was yummy, the corn and squash chowder. We were so lucky the chef made extra as it had sold out, but they were able to find us some.... and it was so worth the wait, especially on a cool fall evening.  Since the burgers were had the last time, they were a must again the second time and were delicious again!! The pear and bier sandwich was very tasty and made a nice option for vegetarians. An appetizer of shrimp and chorizo was ordered from a late joiner to out dinner party and it smelled amazing..... and WAS amazing.  We were thanked by the owner which was a nice touch, but certainly is not expected......  A wonderful experience both times and we will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The complete dining experience was great !    Staff were delighted to be part of the experience and requests were attending to without delay.     Atmosphere that included local artists work and original design left me in a great mood.    Can't wait for next time."}
{"text":"Love the decor.  The wait staffs are great.  Great wine suggestions.  I was there for summerlicious but ended up ordering from the regular menu because it just sounded so good.  The taste lived up to what it sounded like.  I definitely recommend this quant Reataurant to all my friends.  The only reason why I did not give 5 stars is because I would like to see more vegetarian options. I love meat but I love veggies too."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance at Morgan's is great for starters. There beer list is very good and there are a couple of taps on seasonal rotation as well as a cask selection. This joint is great for an east end date because it is quiet enough to talk and such. And as Ryan mentions below it is one of the more upscale dining areas east of Jones. The fried chicken and double smoke burger with smoked cheddar and bacon are consistently great choices for me and the fries are really good. My family enjoys the pizza at Morgan's - the crust is really killer."}
{"text":"I visited this local a couple of times and haven't yet provided a review. The last time I went was on New Years Eve. My husband I booked a table with little notice and it was absolutely great.  The service (thanks Lucy!) was the best as was the food.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a cool local spot. Small inside, great staff and the food and drink menu was well cultivated and well thought-out! I had the Morgan's burger and a few local brews. The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. The owner was hanging-out and while he seemed conversational he also made the staff really tense. Though they were interesting it was as-if they couldn't be themselves. They seemed afraid to be friendly with customers. I definitely value both atmosphere and food and this spot seems like a bit of a trade-off. I'd go back though."}
{"text":"I've been to Morgan's twice so far and both times have been great. Once for drinks and once for dinner.   The night I went for dinner had a great Squash soup and a tasty Burger. Note that there menu has alot of hearty meal offerings and you don't need to go with a burger. Food although pricey was very tasty. its definately worth paying alittle more for a great meal. Drinks were reasonably priced and they have had drink specials each time I've been there. Good selection of beers.  I'll definately be back again."}
{"text":"For family gatherings, you need a place that has a little something for everyone, and Morgan's on the Danforth met our needs!  They had a summerlicious menu   With lots of options but I ordered their fried chicken because they were featured on blogTO as having the best in the East end, so I had to try it!  It wasn't too bad, not the best!! My cousin's wife found it a little dry.  Overall the staff were friendly, and we had a fun time catching up!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and was a place my husband and baby daughter enjoyed going to. The staff are great. The only issue is, we all good food poisoning last night- from a salad, it's the only thing we both ate and have been violently ill for 24-hrs. Ugh."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night for the first because our buddy recommended it to us. The service was great and very welcoming. I had the Sunday Prime Rib dinner and my wife had the ribs and everything was delicious. This is our new go-to place in The Danforth"}
{"text":"i believe the prices are high, and as a vegetarian, find it hard to accept a place that doesnt include a veggie burger, but thats ok, i forgive them. Im so thankful this place opened up in this area, otherwise id be stuck hanging out at tommys grill and bar, or big ronnies. Great staff, amazing attentive service,....Sheila B. I wondered why you were getting such awful service until you said 'unlike the owner, they actualy work for tips' newsflash, anyone serving you gets tipped. you might try it next time, youd be surprised at how the service will improve."}
{"text":"I've been to Morgan's about 5 or 6 times, and every time I've had a great experience.  They have an interesting and rotating selection of beers, with a few permanent ones (no reason to ever permanently remove Guinness!), and a good mix of local brews and brews from afar.    The service is top-notch:  friendly, helpful, cheerful, kind.  The gent behind the bar has an old school touch, whipping up fancy cocktails and bantering with the customers.    Their food is very good.  I've tried the fried chicken, the burgers, wings, and mussels, and all are excellently prepared.  The fried chicken is something they're known for, and it doesn't disappoint.   I've seen people request substitutions, and each time the staff were happy to accommodate.  The place is dimly lit, with chill music playing quietly (jazz, indie, lounge, etc).  There are tables, booths, and bar seating, and the place has character.  I don't like to give out 5-star ratings too easily, but I can't think of a single reason to knock a star off:)    A great place to go for a meal or for drinks."}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancee during Summerlicious, so this review describes our Saturday night Summerlicious 2015 dinner experience here.  Decor: Pretty typical pub/eatery, nothing too fancy, but feels comfortable. Most people there were dressed casually. There were only a few patrons inside when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 7:30pm it was almost full.  Service: Generally good. Our waitress was pleasant but not too talkative which is fine with us. :) Our appetizer and first course arrived quickly, while the dessert seemed to take awhile.  Food: Appetizer (Managua style Ceviche on Tostones) was a nice start, refreshing and tasted good. My mains (Fried chicken, ribs, hushpuppies) was satisfying and a decent portion. The ribs fell right off the bone. The flavor was good, however it could've been a bit more intense. The fried chicken was juicy. And the hushpuppies, they're tough to mess up I think :) My fiancee enjoyed her steak, and the mountain of thinly-cut fries it came with. For dessert, we shared the Beavertail Ice Cream Sandwich and the Aztec Chocolate Brownie with Churros. Both were fantastic and bad for our waistlines. :) (It only came with one churro though, so really, it shouldn't be listed as \"churros\" on the menu.)  Overall it was a good experience and we'd gladly return when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner and food was amazing. Had the buttermilk chicken with fries. Fries were really crispy and the chicken was very tasty.   Design of the restaurant was nice as there was a side for the TV and bar as well as more comfortable seating area booths. I enjoyed the booths as it kept to be private space.   When I went on a Saturday night, it wasn't busy but most seats were occupied. Service was very quick and efficient. Asked for drinks and brought it very quick. When asked questions about the food, staff was very knowledgeable about what is in it. I had to ask because I was allergic to certain foods and had to double check. I didn't have any bad experiences but it took a while to get the bill (seemed understaff when it came closer to closing but I totally understand) while I waited I was able to enjoy the basketball game that was on.   I would definitely go back to try their other foods or even go back for the chicken."}
{"text":"Great place for food. Was here with the wife and we shared the monty cristo and full monty burger.   The monty cristo was absolutely delicious, everything on that sandwich was on point. The panko outside of the sandwich was a nice crunch.  The full monty burger was cooked to perfection, the burger was cooked to medium, the hollandaise sauce made from scratch, a fried egg and bacon! C'mon who doesn't like bacon. The burger was messy but sooooo worth it.  The menu is small but after having our meals they focus on good quality meals.  The reason i placed Morgan's at 4 was for two reasons. The food took a while to get, but when we had our meals it was was worth it. The other reason was due to the fact a lot of homeless people sat beside the store smoking or drinking.  Would i come again, the answer is of course."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to Summerlicious at Morgan's after reading previous reviews, but sadly we left slightly disappointed. Overall the food was pretty good - I enjoyed the corn chowder and grilled cheese (even though only one side of it was grilled). Wasn't particularly thrilled with the fries - they were small and mushy. I saw someone walk by at one point carrying a bag of frozen sweet potato fries, so clearly they're not fresh/hand cut. Dessert was a brownie in a jar with vanilla ice cream and it was delish - warm, gooey and moist.   My boyfriend also enjoyed his meal, although I have to admit we were both surprised when his appetizer arrived at the table. He ordered the smoked Caesar salad which supposedly came with double smoked bacon. The salad arrived with the TINIEST sliver of bacon I've ever seen, it was comical. You may as well have served it without any bacon at all.   Even though the food was enjoyable overall, I ended up giving this experience 3 stars because the service was just so gosh darn slow (and 3 stars is probably being generous)! We went for lunch and ended up being there nearly 2 hours. Luckily we weren't in a rush to be anywhere so it wasn't a huge deal - we're patient people. I'd be willing to come back again, but they need a better system if they're going to participate in Summerlicious."}
{"text":"Great spot on the danforth.  Arrived late afternoon one Sunday to catch up with an old friend. Lots of beer options and focus on Ontario brews.   On the food side - Kevin introduced us to the pate - homemade and really good with a few crunchy side bits like the pickles :). Ce with fresh bread.   I stayed on and had the wings - really recommend them and they got a different sense of heat here so ask for the details.    They used to have a cheese board but go rid of it. If you ask nicely you might be able to get the Brie and blue cheese as a side."}
{"text":"I went Morgan's on the Danforth for Summerlicious, and the menu was just delicious.  To start, I had a maple manhattan, which was served with a lemon foam on top. That drink was so good, the perfect blend of sweet and acid.  I chose a smokey tomato soup for an appetizer, which was nicely smoked.  The main course was fried chicken that was perfectly juicy although not super crispy on the outside but still very tasty. It was served with cornbread, sauteed red chard, and a delicious Sriracha honey dipping sauce.  I'm not a fan of dipping sauce, but that was an outstanding combo of sweet and spicy.  For dessert, I had a burnt sugar bundino (a sort of custardy pudding), which was nice if a little bland. The coffee I had with my dessert was also very nice.    That will definitely be a place I will suggest to out-of-town guests or when someone asks the dreaded, \"Where should we go eat?\""}
{"text":"yep still 2.5 stars, i think i;m going to lay off morgans for awhile.  rainy friday night met friend there for dins.  The fried chicken special for $15 was very home cook try not  good.  it was thick crusted and crunchy but in a flour sort of way.  The curry chicken dish is delish as usual but that $18 price tag is way too high.  My biggest pet peeve is Kevin the owner, he acknowledged my dinner friend but wouldn't even look at me, if fact he said goodbye to her straight in the eye and thanked her for coming out.  WTF i paid the bill and have been going there at least once a week since they opened.  I would call it an oversight but same thing happened last week at lunch (read other review).  The waitstaff are great I like them.   Just because you own the place doesn't mean your above being \"nice\".  Waiting for sauce to open a few doors east maybe that will be my new goto.  As said on chowhound this place has a problem with price point to make a weekly event.  I agree."}
{"text":"Came for return Winterlicious Feb 2018 after coming here 2 years ago. Small local bar serving good quality food. Cozy atmosphere and lots of locals visit on a regular basis.   Had to wait for about 20 min even with a reservation. Manager offered complimentary drinks. Group of 4 sat in a small booth - might be a little tight for some groups.  I'm impressed as winterlicious menu they serve full portions of food, unlike some restaurants that try to skimp you out for portion or service. However, probably due to the busy hours, the food wasn't as superb as I remembered. The coq au vin was a little overcooked and dry, lamb chops were a little chewy, and the trout was undercooked. I'm sure this is a one-off, as the reviews are generally pretty good for this local joint. I'd visit again, but probably not during Winterlicious. The restaurant has enough customers to not needing Winterliciois event, but it's a great opportunity for foodies to discover this place.  Looking forward to try this restaurant again in the future."}
{"text":"This was one of the most enjoyable meals I have had in a very long time. My friend and I wanted to go for a beer and a bite to eat after work, and decided on Morgan's as the restaurant we had originally chosen was closed. I'm glad it was, because we lucked out at Morgan's.  Our server, Lucy, greeted us with a friendly smile and some witty conversation. She introduced us to the menu where absolutely everything looked delicious! Monday is  half price wine night, which can only be a good thing.  We both settled on the friend chicken since it sounded amazing. I ordered the classic Morgan's Fried Chicken and my friend had the Korean Fried Chicken. We also shared the braised beef tacos as an appetizer.   The tacos were out of this world. Packed with tender beef, they were flavourful and satisfying. Our chicken arrived shortly afterwards and WOW, it was awesome! The regular fried chicken was perfectly crispy and full of flavour. My friend's Korean version was unbelievably tender and juicy (Lucy explained that it was brined before frying which might explain it).  Although the food was absolutely amazing, it was Lucy's friendliness and genuine interest in the food that won us over. The prices for food and drink are reasonable and there are daily specials too. We will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Once in a while, I go to a restaurant and leave extremely satisfied - the kind of satisfied that makes me want to tell all my friends about the place and bring my parents the next time they're in town. Based on my first visit, Morgan's is that kind of restaurant.  THE GOOD: - We came for lunch and both got the sandwich of the day: an egg, peameal bacon and cheddar sandwich. This sandwich seriously hit the spot. It was served on the freshest ciabatta bread, and all the ingredients came together perfectly with each bite. I got mine with the soup of the day - a pear and carrot soup - which was the perfect side. - Morgan's has a great selection of beers and ciders. If you enjoy cider, try Spirit Tree! - Our server was a very pleasant gentleman. We came at 2pm for a late lunch, so the place was not very full and we were served quickly.   THE BAD: - I've got nothing!  Overall, I would highly recommend Morgan's to anyone looking for an awesome lunch spot in the East Danforth area. I will definitely be making a second visit to check our their dinner menu in the future."}
{"text":"A great local hangout for myself and some friends in the neighbourhood.  I've only eaten here a couple of times, but the food has always been very good.  The service is wonderful and they have good beers on tap.  My only recommendation is to make reservations, even if you are coming only for drinks or you could be waiting a while."}
{"text":"This restaurant came recommended to us to give a try. So we parked our car  at the subway in Etobcoke and set forth due east. On many notes, this restaurant deserves a five star rating, the decor, the atmosphere, and the friendly service, & beverages were wonderful.  Where it fell short was the food. Given that every one's palette is different... The pan seared scallops were cooked well, but the flavors accompanying them didn't pair well with them, and the \"wilted greens\" were just that unfortunately. For my main, I choose the black cod. We waited quite some time for our appetizer, they kept excusing the delay on Summerlicious. The Morgan's Caesar was delish, and the beers on cask were a worthy mention. But I'm afraid that my Main fell very short of my expectations. This has always been one of my favorite dishes to order, as it is not often available. The cod was cooked nicely, but the rest of the dish fell very short. The veg were cold and very undercooked, and the sauce that was to accompany the cod, In my my opinion, didn't go well with the delicateness of the cod at all.  My friend, on the other hand, had the Korean fried chicken and thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant in the Danforth Coxwell area. We are always on the lookout for special restaurants that really take the time to make the food taste unique and something that is hard to replicate at home. The Korean fried chicken and coconut curry chicken stopped the conversation at our table for a solid 10 minutes of ecstasy. The sticky toffee pudding was equally awesome. Can't wait to come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Looks small from the outside, but inside is surprisingly spacious. There was even a small patio with a few tables out front. Heading inside, a sheik pub atmosphere welcomed us for Summerlicious.   We were seated at the back on the upper level. We checked out the drink menu and I was impressed; they have a great variety of beer! There were many beers I'd never seen before and some usual suspects. They love sourcing locally, but they also embrace the lesser known imports. My aunt tried the Spirit Tree Pub Cider and I was going through Mill Street Organic withdrawals, so I had to have my favourite!    Let's get to the knitty gritty, the Prix Fixe. When it comes to app, all I needed to see was the word 'tostones' and I was sold. Managua style Ceviche on Tostones was our selection. I don't think there was any tilapia in there, but there was a LOT of shrimp. The citrus flavours gave this an airy feel. Could've been a few more chips, but this was a great app. It wasn't heavy and filling, it was just enough to stop the hangry.   For our entrees, I chose Gaucho and she went with Southern Comfort. The Southern Comfort consisted of chicken and ribs with a delightful coleslaw and hushpuppies. A beautiful dish. The chicken batter was crisp and not greasy. The ribs were seasoned and sauced to perfection. The meat was juicy and fell right off the bone. To balance the savoury meats, the honey vinegar coleslaw was the perfect side. My steak was cooked to order and came with shoestring french fries. How often do you see those in a restaurant?! The chimichuri sauce was a shining star on this plate. The locally grown herbs complimented the flavours of the steak well. I wish I'd had more to dip my fries in.  Dessert has arrived! My Aztec Brownie with Churros was enough to kill the chocolate craving. The churros were unnecessary. They were blah. My aunt enjoyed Oma's Peach Crumble Cake. The cake and crumble were not overly sweet, allowing the peaches to be the star.    The service was great. They were really personable and easy to talk to. The manager made his rounds to make sure everyone was having good time. The timing of each course was perfect; they weren't rushing you, but they weren't letting you take a nap between. This place really has their act together!   I'd come back to try their regular menu....I'm a sucker for a gastropub!"}
{"text":"Went for Father's day, they have a brunch menu only from 11 to 3pm and there is a decent selection of items.  The house made Bloody Mary mix is very tasty and there is a good selection of cocktails and rotating taps on offer. I have to say that I was disappointed in the double smoked burger; it just didn't live up to the description and the pastrami hash was light on the pastrami but the Halibut and frites were tasty and our server was fantastic; really warm and friendly"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants on the Danforth. Service is always excellent, food is plentiful, fresh and delicious. The Korean fried chicken, amazing. Price, completely reasonable."}
{"text":"Seriously YUM!  Went on Monday night (1/2 price wine!) during Winterlicious.  The options were extensive (5 or 6 apps & mains, 3 desserts), the service was prompt, helpful, unobtrusive & the dishes were beautifully presented and delicious. Lamb chops in a rich meaty sauce, vegetables crisp & colourful. The simple Caesar salad was bright  & full-flavoured-- not a morsel left on the plate. A tiger shrimp tempura creatively atop a tangy slaw.   Low enough noise level to permit conversation!   The decor isn't fancy but the quality of the food & service, with reasonable prices make this a \"go-back-to\" place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! From start to finish, a pleasure and a delicious treat. Thank you for a nice Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"Four star food at a five star price.  Don't get me wrong. the food and service were both great at Morgans. In fact, I was extra pleased  when I saw the menu and it wasn't another run-of-the-mill pub. But the meal price-point, IMO, is s-t-e-e-p.  Every member of the staff we talked to were friendly, attentive and  knowledge which made for a great start to the night.  The drink menu is large,  in wine, spirits and beer. and, as a beer drinker, the selection was very different from most restaurants in general and certainly head-and-shoulders above the rest of the restaurants in the neighbourhood. You'll see plenty of Canadian product including lots of micro brews.  The food menu has a different selection of items as well. I'm particularly curious about the burger topped with a quail egg and Hollandaise.  And the food, in a word: delicious. In more words, everything was flavourful, hot and cooked perfectly. The scallops were seared, but not dry and the rare steak was actually rare - seared on the outside and perfectly red in the middle. It can be done!  If you're in the area or don't mind dropping a little extra, it's definitely worth a try. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be back anytime soon. Seems like a nice place for locals to go when they want to enjoy a pub atmosphere while their kids enjoy safe, plain food and they can indulge in a steak or other hard-to-screw-up food. I can see why that would work and why on a Monday night, the place is crawling with kids. As an empty nester, I'm feeling like I've done my share of dinners in romper rooms, so we pick a place on the patio.  Fries were quite possibly the worst I've ever had. Incredibly dark brown, extremely soggy and limp, yet still somehow undercooked on the inside. If I was in a different mood I may have sent them back. But stupidly, I eat them all, ironically using mayo to disguise the greasy taste.  Salads were okay. Quinoa burger didn't hold together and was very bland. Bun was unattractive and very  plain. Beer was flat."}
{"text":"Came here recently after a visit for drinks last year - food looked good then, and still does now.  Showed up at a respectable dinner hour and found the place practically empty - hopefully it was just a quiet night because this is a great addition to the Greenwood area.  It was a night with friends so we all had something different.  One of us tried the duck special, which was fantastic.  The other had the bacon cheeseburger that he reviewed as one of the best burgers in town.  I had the wrap of the day which was quite tasty as well.  My only beef about dinner was charging for a side of mayo - yes, it's dumb to complain about this but I also think it's dumb to charge for a condiment (though I do thank the server for telling me they did before bringing it).  A pretty flawless night here.  I'll be back.  Great food quality, good prices and extremely friendly service.  I might not come to Greenwood often, but when I do, I will definitely think about eating here first.  Well done Morgan's."}
{"text":"I would certainly go back again! After visiting for Winterlicious this evening, I was so impressed with the service, the ambience and of course the food. It is beautifully put-together without being pretentious. The menu is very creative and the drink menu is sensational as well. I loved the Southern Comfort Redux option - so many delicious flavours.  Our server Lucy was so personable and great at her job! The host (maybe manager) did his best to make sure we were seated right away for our reservation and went out of his way to thank us for coming as we left."}
{"text":"I've been going to Morgan's for years, though the name and ownership has changed. Last time I was there i had what they call \"just a burger\" and man, was it good. A hockey coach once told me to \"do less better\" and thats what this burger is. Not flashy, but it brings the word \"classic\" to mind.   There is also a nice selection of beer both in bottles on tap. If you like a cold one, this is a strong place to go.   The price is a little steep IMO. Hence three stars and not four"}
{"text":"I don't come to the Danforth that often, but when I do, it's almost always for Greek food. It was refreshing to come to this slightly upscale gastro pub for a Summerlicious dinner.   The place was packed, as are most restaurants that participate in the Summerlicious event. Therefore, the service was a little slower than I would have preferred.   I had the smoky tomato soup, which was indeed smoky and flavourful, though a tad on the salty side. For my main, I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, which was so moist, tender and crispy. I just wish it was marinated in a little more spices. The dipping sauce that came with the chicken was absolutely divine! The uber flavourful Sriracha honey sauce tasted like something you might find from a specialty gourmand shop. The dish did come with chard and cornbread, which was delicious.   I never went to camp as a child, so I missed out on the whole smore making experience around a bonfire. Was I ever happy to see that a smore was on the dessert menu, so I just had to sample it! I do believe the smore I had was a more upscale version of the camper's delight. It wasn't messy or gooey, although I would have preferred more marshmallowy gooey goodness. The smore tasted similar to that of a decadent brownie.    While the starter and the dessert were perfectly portioned, the fried chicken dish was massive! You will definitely not leave Morgan's hungry! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2016 -Double Garlic Caesar -Zucca al Forno Arrancini  --Welly County Dark Lamb Shank En Crouse --Southern Comfort Redux ---Brown Butter and Bourbon Cannoli ---Dark Chocolate, Coffee and Salted Caramel Pudding Parfait  Overall very good food.  Apps were a good start to the meal.  Lamb was very nicely cooked, good mix of flavors.  The fried chicken had a nice kick and the jalapeño corn bread was tasty.  The pudding Parfait was heavy and rich! (Be warned... Save space)  And Cannoli was the \"lighter\" but equally good dessert.   Service was 20% worthy, included great recommendations"}
{"text":"A hidden gem on the Danforth!  We wandered into here randomly looking for a nice dinner late on a Friday night and we were pleasantly surprised!  The food was great, fresh and homemade, and the service was also excellent.  We shared the beet salad which was well flavoured but had shredded beets rather than sliced (I prefer the texture of sliced so personally would not order this again).  I had the turkey meatball spaghettini which was perfect!  My friend had the buttermilk chicken which was actually excellent - the best I've found in Toronto.  The jalapeno cornbread was also excellent - so fresh you could see corn kernels in it.  Everything was made in house.  We had a male bartender/server (with a beard and French speaking ... do not know his name) and he was outstanding.  Very helpful w recommendations and accommodating when I requested extra pasta sauce late into the meal.  Even the vibe was pleasant - there were a few other patrons at the bar and the vibe was friendly and surprisingly intellectual w a number of fun and lively debates going on.    Really enjoyed our meal there and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly and very accommodating staff, good food, and knowledgeable bartender make this a great place to hang out.   Hoisin Chili Chicken Wings and Smoked Old Fashioned... mmmmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Tuesday, September 16th, 2014:  Very impressive place!  Yet another very local restaurant to me that I only tried recently.  I went with the French Martini to begin with and it was quite good.  The pineapple foam was a nice touch.  If you are looking for a sweeter cocktail, look no further.  For food we went with apps: the pizza, the board and the calamari.  The pizza is unlike anything you may have had since the dough/crust since it is fried.  Greasy but good.  This would be an excellent thing to share with 3 other people.  The board was great--fine selection of meats, cheeses, olives, breads, etc.  I was not a fan of the pate but I just do not dig pate.  I could have used a little more of another kind of cheese.  Maybe more bread/crackers would have worked.  But it is a really nice thing to share and is good value.  Again, this is perfect for a foursome.  The calamari is probably the best I've had in the city.  I used to love this back home; there was a place in Long Beach (George's Greek Deli, on Pine) that made the best.  This came pretty close to that--small, pieces, cooked well, not too rubbery.  The dipping sauce was a perfect accompaniment.  Again, it is a lot for just two--bring friends.  Service was tops.  Several people came by to check on us.  All in, with tip and tax, the food and three drinks was $80 which I feel was pretty fair.    The interior is classy.  This is most certainly a place to go for a nicer meal or to impress a date.  I am quite pleased to finally have a place, besides Sarah's, to go for a non ethnic, nicer meal, within walking distance.  The Danforth just keeps finding reasons for me to never move."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Morgan's.  This is our neighborhood go-to-pub and they have consistently delivered.  Tonight we sat at the bar and enjoyed some pints along with fish and chips - good pub food.  Fish was lightly breaded and nice piece of fish, served up with some crunchy fries.    Great meal and as always, friendly efficient service."}
{"text":"Great jazzy atmosphere, gourmet grub and a beer/wine snob's delight.  Highly recommend it for Brunch or Dinner...lovely jazz on Sundays."}
{"text":"The other positive reviews are pretty much bang-on. This is a much-needed gastropub just off of Greenwood subway station. Upscale Pub would be another word for it.   A little bit on the pricier side, but the food is quite excellent. Also the booths have electrical plugs (!), and dimmer switches (!!). The place has WiFi access if you ask nicely. Beer selection is very good. Daily specials always have a lot of love put into them. And it's just a nice place to hang out. There's a little patio in the front as well.  Staff has always been super friendly and awesome every time I've been there, and that's a lot.  There's a pretty good space in the back for larger groups. It can get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights. On Sundays I believe there is live jazz.  You do see some parents show up with kids occasionally but it's hardly a problem as other reviewers seemed to think. Frankly it's a little too high end for that to be much of a big deal.   There is a TV showing sports over the bar but it's not too distracting; strikes a good balance between those who are interested and sitting at the bar to catch a game, and those who are not (ahem) sitting at all the other tables/booths.  It's kind of become my default watering hole/pub grub spot on my end of the Danforth and that is perfectly ok. I only wish they had better neighbours."}
{"text":"Had the Roast Beef. Nicely done. Good wine selection. Veggies were also nicely done. If I had one comment to make for improvement it was that the frites showed up under the Roast Beef, so got a bit steamed/soggy, and I like 'em crispy.  Service was great, nice ambience. Patio available, and wine by the bottle at half price on Mondays. All in all, good value and repeatable."}
{"text":"Made reservations on a Friday evening for a party of 10, plus 1 baby, and these guys were so accommodating! They didn't make a big fuss when members of our party were late (so sorry, Morgan's!), they didn't ask us to sit down while we were taking photos, and they were very attentive when giving us the split bills. We were probably any server's worst nightmare!! But everyone was very nice, friendly, helpful, and service was excellent. They didn't even add gratuity automatically!   Onto food and drinks - excellent. There were fancy cocktails (delicious, strong, unique), uncommon beers, and then also some common stuff. Something for everyone! I really enjoyed the Corpse Reviver.   For food, we ordered charcuterie, the trio of dips, calamari, and then everyone got their own mains. Everything was delicious. The fried chicken was very popular!! I had the wild boar ragu which was really nice. Fresh and hearty!   Crowd is mixed, older (mid-20s and above). Atmosphere was very lively. Thank you Morgan's!"}
{"text":"This is is a very well run restaurant full of regular locals. The food and service is always amazing! Everything is fresh and of quality. They have great specials and a standard menu that won't disappoint. The first time I went they had a bbq rib special that was mouth watering and wish they had on their regular menu as it would be a great staple. I had their lamb curry the second time, and it also was very tasty. My wife had the salmon which was a smaller portion but tasted incredible. Wine selection is very strong and they are good with pairings. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. Being walking distance to our house, we will return many times over."}
{"text":"Walked in Monday Night w/o RSVP. They we're busy but still had a couple of tables available & patio setting. I felt like they could have used another server for more of a smooth service but they did great. Will definitely be going back fir more."}
{"text":"A very tiny restaurant along a very busy street.  If you can get in, it's a pretty good place to eat.  They have a nice selection of offerings and some standard meals with a twist.  Usually here for brunch.    Delicious but busy.  Service sometimes suffers because of it."}
{"text":"This place has downtown gastropub aspirations, which makes sense considering it's ties to the Hot House. It's is a good safe option for the east end.   The plates are mostly classic and familiar, with some twists. Food is good quality, and well made. At one time the chef was a winner of a cooking show if that makes a difference to your dining experience.   For the price points I would like to see larger portion sizes.  Service is friendly, in a practiced and cordial way."}
{"text":"I LOVED going here. The Chef recently won Chopped Canada and it is easy to see why! I went with two friends, I had the Mussels and Frites, and they had the Quinoa Burger and the Brisket burger.  It was all absolutely delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone because they have a great variety of food and the wait staff were so friendly and helpful. They really know their stuff and they were great at recommending wine and beer to go with our selection.  I was visiting from Ottawa and I will be coming back next time I am in Toronto, it is really that good!"}
{"text":"We were here this evening for dinner.  I had a fried chicken craving.  I ordered the Korean fried chicken, and my hubby had the Morgans fried chicken.  I would order my dish again.  I enjoyed the kimchi fried rice and the bok choy.  His fried chard was delicious.  The service was also good.  This place has a pub like feel, but nicer/  There's also a cute patio.  Overall, its recommended."}
{"text":"This review is based on my latest visit. My first two visits were decent but really had a damper put on them by the server (the same person in both cases) who had the bizarre habit of telling me how much she disliked the items I had ordered as she delivered them to the table. I don't mind some feedback on menu items but it would be more useful to give before it's too late to order something else, no?   On this particular visit that server was no where to be seen thankfully. The server we had was lovely and friendly, as was the owner Kevin.  We clearly weren't in a healthy eating mood that day, so we ordered:  Spicy calamari - this was spicy, crispy, and delicious! Would definitely order it again.  Fried chicken - this was a super generous three-piece portion (not sure if that's how it always comes but that's what I got). The texture of the coating was nice, crispy and not-too-greasy, but flavour-wise it needed some herbs/spices. The braised kale with bacon that came on the side was fab. The cornbread I thought was just okay.  Fish and chips - my husband ordered this; he felt the fish was a bit dry. It did come with a super generous portion of well-prepared fries though.  I do agree that the pricing is a little on the high side given the restaurant's location and the simplicity of the menu items. On the other hand the portions are generous and the food is definitely better than many of the other offerings in the vicinity, but I just couldn't justify making a weekly trip there.  We also tried a couple of their cocktails: Manhattan - which was good and strong The Honeycomb - prepared with house-made honeycomb infused vodka with an orange twist, this was very easy to drink. Dangerous!  Glad to see a restaurant in this neighbourhood branching out from just serving beer (even if it is the craft kind). Will definitely return from time to time."}
{"text":"The service here sets Morgan's apart from the other bars in the area. From the outside Morgan's isn't much to look at - which is why it took me way too long to discover this gem in the neighbourhood!   I saw Morgan's listed on BlogTo as having the best nachos in the area and had to go try. I adore nachos and theirs are definitely good. Not amazing, but good. Some of the cheese wasn't melted, and there were quite a few bare chips (it's all about distribution of toppings ) but the charred corn and fresh jalapeños were great. Mostly, sitting at the bar was awesome and our bartender made fantastic cocktails. The prices for cocktails here are very reasonable - with lots of options coming in around the $10/$11 mark.   We enjoyed ourselves so much we came back the next day! The place was packed when we arrived, but the owner carried over a barstool so that the two of us could sit at the bar together.   We had a different bartender tonight and he was clearly scrambling to keep up with orders. It was hard getting his attention to order even though we were sitting right in front of him. He forgot to tell us about the dinner specials, and when we asked he didn't remember what they were and made no effort to explain them. When I did order a salad, he left immediately to put in the order before I could double check that it was gluten free. The salad arrived with deep fried battered onions on top (not listed in the item description on the menu), and I couldn't eat it. He was very understanding though and had a new salad made and sent over. Just wish he had taken a bit more time so we could have avoided wasting food the first time around!   Those minor things aside, this is a fantastic spot and I think my favourite in the area. Highly recommend it - and can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try winterlicious lunch today.  Sat down and was rejected for the special menu as the waitress said IT IS FOR RESERVATION ONLY.  I tried out so many licious restaurants before and this was the worst policy ever.  Will never go back as the restaurant don't even offer online reservation :("}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood restaurant. I came here for brunch with friends and small kids. The staff were very accommodating and the food was great. It came out quickly was delicious.   The soups are also really good. A few years ago, this restaurant was at the Soupalicious festival (http://www.soupalicious.ca/) but I haven't seen them recently. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Morgan's: what a gem of the Greenwood area!  Morgan's was the first stop of my Summerlicious Dinners for 2013. I wanted to try somewhere outside of the downtown core, and stumbled across Morgan's when searching for some restaurants along the Danforth. I hadn't heard a thing about Morgan's previously, but the menu looked stellar so I decided to give this place a try, and wow, was I ever glad that I did!  Morgan's has the look of a typical pub from the outside with a small patio out front. Once you walk in, it still seems Pub-like, but a bit more like a classy pub (is that an oxymoron =P?) There is bar area seating with a large television, as well as booths, tables, and some high tables/booths.   Service was okay. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, but pretty absent, especially as the night went on. I'm guessing that a lot of that had to do with the large volume that Summerlicious brings in, though.  The food menu is interesting: I wouldn't say that Morgan's abides to a certain cuisine. The 'licious menu consisted of things like: Fried Chicken, Pork Cheek Tostadas, Fish Cakes, Tomato Bisque, even Smores!  Here's what I opted for: Caesar Salad: Served with an anchovy on top - just like it's meant to be! Yum! Not over or under dressed, and a good portion size. My party absolutely RAVED about the other two options (Tomato Bisque and Fish Cakes.)  Fried Chicken with sautéed red chard, bacon, and cheddar corn bread. Served with a Honey Sriracha Dipping Sauce. HOLY. MOLY. That Honey Sriracha stuff is INCREDIBLE. The combo sounds weird, but the sweet and spicy combo is fantastic. If they sold bottles of this stuff I'd buy it regularly. The fried chicken was nice and moist, as was the cheddar corn bread. Great flavours all around and a fantastic dish.  For dessert I had the Burnt Sugar Bundino with Fleur de Sel and dark chocolate dipped Sponge toffee. The Bundino was good, but a bit plain. I was expecting more of the sponge toffee as a part of the dish, but it was more of a garnish. Regardless, it was good!  However, I wish I had ordered the Smore. I sampled a friends and it was fantastic. Cinnamon graham crust with chocolate GLB Harry Porter ganache topped with homemade marshmallow fluff. It was decadent and delicious. The ganache was fantastic, and the marshmallow fluff was lightly roasted. It reminded me more of a ganachey brownie rather than a smore, but whatever it was, it rocked!  Greenwood is not an area I'm in too often, but I'm so happy I stumbled upon Morgan's for Summerlicious, as this is a place I likely would not have come across otherwise. I look forward to checking Morgan's out outside of Summerlicious!"}
{"text":"Really good tasty food. Had the prix fixe: very flavorful cheddar ale soup (not too thick with braised onions and carrots), comfort platter of meatloaf stuffed with cheese, a fried chicken drumstick, mashed potato and Swiss chard. Desert was warm German apple cake and premium quality ice cream. All for $25! Service was prompt. Steps from Greenwood subway station. Took one star away because the banquette I sat on had a deep seat (about 24 in) that you couldn't use the back rest without your feet dangling off the floor. I have never experienced this before as I am 6 feet tall. But no problem until I left and my back hurt for the next hour. Oh well, small price to pay for a very good meal!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for a more upscale gastro pub on the the Danforth. Beer selection is great - lots of local brews. Food is pretty good and there's lots of choice for picky eaters. Service is very good."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place for dinner. Waitress was super nice and friendly. Food was good. Close to subway."}
{"text":"Even though it is also a pub, Morgans is also a bit of an oasis with its tall benches that allow for privacy and a buffer to noise. I was still in a pretty sensitive state when we got together. This was exactly what I needed the night we went for the first time.  We began by sharing the Caesar salad because the inclusion of anchovy and Reggiano cheese suggested it was an authentic Caesar with lots of flavour, complete with a crispy crostini.  One friend ordered the mussels \"Steamed with leeks, diced tomatoes, parsley, garlic, saffron and Side Launch Wheat beer\" which looked fantastic. As great the frites looked you might want to order a side place of bread for dipping into that flavourful jus.  My other friend at first tackled the Southern fried chicken with knife and fork and then gave in with her fingers and teeth. It looked so good and Sriracha honey the perfect sweet heat accent. The jalapeño corn bread also looked fantastic.  A friend had sent me some money to use to go out to dinner with friends so I used it wisely and got the wild boar and mushroom ragu. Slow roasted boar meat with red wine, herbs, tomato and mushrooms served over penne? OMG, delicious! So filling and I almost ate every single bite. It was super tasty without being too gamey, I loved it and would order it again.  We shared the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream for dessert and it was very good, although I must admit I have had better elsewhere and at home. The texture was right but it was quite heavy on the spices. A little too strong for me.  There is even more seating at the back of the restaurant so it can accommodate quite a few people. Our server was super nice and quite delightful too. I ended up really enjoying my time at Morgans with my friends. We got to catch up on each other's lives without music blaring too loudly or people listening in. The food was really fantastic and the service could not have been better. I highly recommend it be a place to go when you need to eat and connect with friends or family in a cozy environment on a dark winter's night. ~ Suzie The Foodie  For full story visit: http://www.suziethefoodie.com/morgans-danforth-restaurant-review/"}
{"text":"Cozy pub atmosphere, friendly staff, and twists on pub classics.  There's a lot of pubs in Toronto, and all over the world, and they all serve the same foods. Fish N Chips, Burgers, and if your lucky maybe a Lamb Shank. Morgan's menu has a lot more creativity than your average pub, and for me that goes a long way.  We went there for Winterlicious Lunch this year, and we both had the Mulligatawny soup to start. It was quite delicious, and the perfect thing to have on a cold January day. It had a good amount of flavour, and wasn't overly spiced, and had nice textures. I'd order this again.  For our mains, we shared the Smokey Mac 'n' Cheese (Baked pasta with a creamy pimentón and smoked cheddar sauce, topped with crispy cornbread crumbs, served with sautéed collard greens), and The Martino Sandwich (Slow roasted pork shoulder, braised rapini with garlic and chili, giardiniera and provolone cheese on North Pole Bakery crusty Italian bread with house frites). I liked the twist of using cornbread as the topping, instead of breadcrumbs on the mac 'n' cheese. Adding this and the collard greens really hit on the Southern roots of the dish. It was definitely smokey in a good way. My only complaint would be that the collard greens were a little greasy, but still tasted good. For the sandwich, I was happy to see that the bun came from a bakery right down the street. The best part of the sandwich was the cheese, braised rapini and chili, which all gave it a lot of flavour and made it more interesting than most sandwiches. The frites were tiny and delicious.  For dessert we both had the Tiramisu Doughnut Cheesecake Bar (House made coffee doughnut base, creamy mascarpone cheesecake, topped with crumbled Oreos and a warm chocolate ganache drizzle). What can I say? It was sweet and delicious. It tasted like a Tiramisu Cheesecake. The doughnut portion didn't really come through like a doughnut... but that's okay. Creative and delicious. Bravo.  Next time I'll need to try some Left Field beer!"}
{"text":"Love Morgans. Real excellence in food. They care. They're friendly. The food is good and so are the drinks!!!!"}
{"text":"My man and I go here quite often and love this place.  I had the trout special last night and it was wonderful.  The pate is so yummy and my man orders the Korean chicken everytime. the wine selection is well thought out and the prices are fair. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well four of us ate here, 2  of us give it a 3 and 2 gave it at 2. It really went downhill from years ago. The carbonara pasta was the worst the noodles were really but there was no cream or cheese etc. The Fried Chicken came with one corn muffin only as a side and it was overcooked and dry. If you want to go there for a drink the beer and wine menu was okay and the music wasn't too loud but I would pass on eating there."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and 3 year old son and it was great from start to finish.  Very child friendly, amazing service and the burgers were juicy and delicious.  We'll be back soon!"}
