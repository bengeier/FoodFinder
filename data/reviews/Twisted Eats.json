{"text":"Waiting 55 minutes for 2 order is unacceptable in every way, shape, and form. You have been warned. I have to type more in order for this to be accepted as a review."}
{"text":"I ordered the Beer Cheese and Pretzels. The cheese was very good, but the pretzels were dry and stale, clearly from the day before or just not very good. Not what i expected for $8. With that being said, the menu was very intriguing and if I'm at Wooden Robot I would try something else."}
{"text":"I really like the concept behind executive chef Rob Masone's TWISTED EATS food truck. He takes perennial favorites and twists them into something new and better. 

For instance, the Boss Hogg Mac & Cheese Eggroll takes everyday, real mac and cheese, throws in a layer of delicious pulled pork, wraps the combination in egg roll pastry and then deep fries the lot. The resulting golden brown confection is comfort food dialed past 11, into sinful and then sealed there with an sweet drizzle. 

This is must-try Charlotte cookery."}
{"text":"Second time trying twisted eats food truck while having a few beers at wooden robot. This food truck is awesome. All food inspired by the beer at wooden robot and extremely friendly personnel including Rob the owner. Tried the waffle burger, would disregard the review below its very different and messy but completely delicious. What do you expect? It's a food truck with amazing greasy food. We're not eating at a 5 star restaurant here. 

This food truck is great with an ever changing menu, also just found out they serve brunch at the brewery every other Sunday. Can't wait to try it.

Definitely a great food truck worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Beer Cheese around.  Mac and Cheese Egg Roll is fantastic...must get the bacon bites as well.  If I am even close I have to stop and get the beer cheese.  Wooden Robot is great as well."}
{"text":"The killing me grilled cheese was good but the sauce and tots were lacking.  Friendly staff and pretty quick service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were having a beer at Bulldog Beer & Wine and the man next to us was eating something that smelled so amazing we had to have it. Turns out it was the Tater Pie Waffle Big \"MC\" from Twisted Eats, which the chef said was a play on a Big Mac.. it has pickles, 'special sauce', etc, but is a served in between 2 sesame seed waffles!  It was HUGE, delicious, and it came with truffle fries - for $9! Definitely a great stop when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Aweful the lack of cheese is one thing but where was the meat...?!??!?!no cilantro drizzle or anything would rather have anything else but the beer is awesome! !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an okay food truck. I did not care for their fat chubby pretzels. I was expecting more of the large twisted variety. These did not taste freshly made. The pulled pork and macaroni and cheese egg roll was okay. It was a bit greasy though. The lady working the truck was nice"}
{"text":"This is located outside The Wooden Robot Brewery.  Pretty cool menu of beer cooked goodness.   It's hard hanging out inside when everyone is eating from it, the aroma just makes you so hungry.   I went with the Mac & Cheese egg roll and the Duck Quesadilla.   Both were fantastic and hit the spot!   Wash it down with a perfect craft beer and life is good!   My only gripe is that they do not give you a lot of ketchup, just one little cup for four extra large egg rolls."}
{"text":"This is the best. Seriously. I'm not sure what some people think because, honestly, they combine the most wonderful flavors and things. Each is unique and sooo tasty. I love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Crazy food truck!! With some crazy good ideas!

This place seems to be a fixture outside of Wooden Robot (because they use their beer to cook with).

One of their signature items is the beer cheese and pretzels - a must order each time - goes so well will Overachiever Pale in the other hand!

Macaroni and Cheese eggrolls (Boss Hog) are probably the next best thing - the macaroni gets cooked in beer, mixed with different cheeses, including Gruyere, and pulled pork - and you can probably guess the rest!

Next go round I'm trying the Hop Rocks Fried Ribs!"}
{"text":"Had twisted eats the other day at wooden robot brewery. I got the tossed tofu steak which has sriracha braised tofu, basalmic fennel portobello, candied red pepper and napa cabbage. It was super yummy but very very spicy. If it wasn't so spicy,  I would've probably gave it a 5. I ate the whole thing and all my friends really enjoyed it too. I did try the grilled cheese sandwich and it was good too but not as good as the tofu. The plates may give you are perfect for the food it is thick and does not leak."}
{"text":"FOOD TRUCK HEAVEN! Twisted Eats right outside of Wooden Robot Brewery! Outstanding..I have wanted to try it for a while and last night I had a great tasting of it. Started with the Duck Quesadillas, Outstanding with Duck confit stuffed into the tortillias..Really delicious! My friends had the Pork Cubano Sandwiches ..Very meaty and good, and We had the Bacon Bites..which were  a little bit of heaven in my mouth! We had a Vegetarian at the table who had the Portebello Burger and moaned it was so good!  .Really this Food Truck Rocks! The Beer at the Brewery is great with the food!!"}
{"text":"Located right outside the Wooden Robot Brewery you don't have to go far to find some solid food to go with your craft beer. The menu sounds amazing and I wanted to order one of everything right off the bat. Ended up trying the Mac n cheese and pork egg rolls and a side of dusted tots and both were delicious. My only gripe would be I would've wanted more pork in the egg roll. Looking forward to trying the beer cheese at my next visit."}
{"text":"The food would have been pretty good if it wasn't so greasy. Don't get me wrong I love greasy fried food, I'm a fat guy after all. The concept was great with the macaroni and cheese egg rolls, but they were so greasy I almost couldn't eat them. My wife and I have had stomach aches since. My wife even threw up! Please the next time you guys serve these egg rolls. dry them off first."}
{"text":"This is the food truck that is parked outside of Wooden Robot brewing.

Their offerings include recipes made from Wooden Robot beers.  

I ordered the Cuban and order of tots, not knowing that the Cuban already came with tots and the staff didn't bother to tell me that. So both were $10 each. $10 for Tots????  

The sandwich was good but a little small for $10 and well the tots were just tots with a few toppings. I wasn't impressed.

I can't say I'll order from here again. I think they are a bit pricey but do appreciate that Wooden Robot has a regular food truck."}
{"text":"Twisted Eats has been on my list to try ever since John H told me about Hop Rocks fried ribs. HELLO, I NEED THAT IN MY LIFE RIGHT MEOW! 

Twisted Eats is Charlotte's first beer inspired food truck. Chef Rob from Kre8 catering makes all his menu items with Wooden Robot beer. I was a little devastated to see the ribs were not on the menu when we were there on Saturday. I fought through the sadness though, or I guess i should say I drank through the sadness. 

We ordered the beer cheese and pretzels and the boss hog egg rolls. I am pretty sure this is the best beer cheese in Charlotte. I'm slightly concerned that I am going to have to avoid South End now because I'll want to go get this beer cheese every time I'm in the area. The egg rolls were also delicious. The mac and cheese inside of them is boiled in beer. I found myself dipping the egg rolls in the beer cheese when I ate all my pretzel. 

I echo John H here and recommend ordering a bunch of different plates to share with friends so you can try it all. I've got to go back for the duck quesadilla. And hello, I still need these fried ribs in my life."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and I say to die for and so much better the saucemans here you get more food and better food for a reasonable price. I went two days in a row, to the point I took my sister and she loved it as while we will be back."}
{"text":"Split the Mac n cheese egg rolls with my husband while enjoying some beers at Wooden Robot. It took awhile for our food to be ready which was annoying because we were just expecting a couple deep fried Mac n cheese bites. But when it was ready we discovered a large pound of Mac n cheese with duck bits tucked into a huge yummy, crunchy egg roll wrapper! It smelled beyond heavenly. I just can't even begin to try to describe this smell. Just know that it made me stop what I was doing and take a slow bite, even though it was hotter than hell and I burnt my tongue. There was some type of sauce mixed in through the egg rolls as well. I wish there was more of that in it, on it, and to dunk them in! 10/10 for great food truck for any day at any time."}
{"text":"I had high expectations going in bc of all the press I had read. I like the concept of using all Wooden Robot beer in their food. We had the duck quesadilla and the Mac and cheese egg rolls. They were both very good, but I think the quesadilla could've been a little more beefy for the price (aka more duck), and I think the egg rolls needed a little salt and a dipping sauce. We will eat here again, but I wasn't amazed. Wish there was a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying Twisted Eats the other week while enjoying some drinks at Wooden Robot.  The food concepts seem pretty crazy...  (Disclaimer: you will want to order the entire menu) but I found the best way is to invite a group of friends, have everyone pick one thing on the menu, and have a nice sharefest...

My band of three friends started with the 5 cheese beer cheese and pretzel which was AMAZEBALLS....  My pick off the menu was the fried ribs.  Even more AMAZEBALLS than the beer cheese.  The pork was fall off the bone and there was a nice crispy, little spicy sauced outer layer.  So much goodness and so worth it.

My buddies picked the duck quesadilla and Mac and cheese egg rolls.  All very solid options.  I love the fact that they collaborate with Wooden Robot.  For example the Fried Ribs uses a base of Hop Rocks IPA mixed with burnt bourbon-mango Bbq.

It's actually pretty refreshing to see a local brewery have a dedicated food truck to collaborate and pair their beers.  Yes, you lose he variety, but I think he Twisted Eats menu has something for everyone (a great, unique take on food that compliments Wooden Robots brews).  Looking forward to tackling the other eats on the menu!!"}
