{"text":"Love. Excellent meals both times we ordered. Food that's is prepared with love and intention. Satisfying and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome food here. I'm staying here for an event for the weekend and the food was excellent. If I ever just stop through Charlotte I will stop by here and eat. Words can't express how good the good is. Just simply amazing."}
{"text":"My car was filled to roof and I was tired so ate at the hotel bar.  Unlike many hotels they do not try to create a separate space as no separate between lobby and here.    Place attracts a crowd as it is a large hotel and seem to do plenty of meetings.    They could stand on their own as do local brews, gastropub and good service.    I prefer my salad more mixed up but know places like the pretty layout.   Cocktails I had were well balanced. Not sure come here just to eat or drink but if at the hotel it is a better option than going to nearby chili"}
