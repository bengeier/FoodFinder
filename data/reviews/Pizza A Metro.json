{"text":"Just had their chicken special today -- chicken caprese.  It was served RAW.  I had one bite and took a look and almost fainted.  They made me a new one, however, I didn't have the stomach to eat.  Still charged me $15.95 for the raw chicken dish.  They did throw in a free dessert to go which I did not want.  Hope I pull thru.  Won't be back that is for sure."}
{"text":"I will never wait in line at Biancos again unless it is just for the appetizers.    This is really good pizza and worth cramming into the little restaurant.  They make the biggest pizza I have ever seen and if you have a small car it probably won't fit for take-out so be prepared to strap it to the roof or something."}
{"text":"Horrible service and insulting prices. We didn't even wait for the food. Person at bar especially smug and nasty."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but is definitely worth it if you want a quality pizza. Small location, and the staff is nice, they gave me a free tiramisu cake the second time I stopped by. Would come by again if I had the extra cash"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great service. The calamari was delicious and the cheesecake sublime. I would definitely go again. It was well worth the drive from Tucson."}
{"text":"If you love brick oven pizza, this place has some of the best I've ever had.  We were visiting Phoenix and read reviews on this place and decided to try it.  It's a quaint Italian restaurant run my an Italian that offers many Italian classics.  If I ever find myself in the area I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I have ate here a couple times now since they have opened and I think they are amazing . I'm so happy this restaurant opened and is not that far from me . The other restaurant can't even compare to this place now. First of all let's talk about how delicious and fresh there food is . The thing I love and adore the most is that it's all made from scratch . I adore the Spaghetti Bolgnesse , I would have to say that is honestly my favorite dis there . It is always so fresh, hot and ready . Lets talk about the bread with it and that sauce with the bread ... Oh mamma is that good :) Then don't even get me started with how freshly and delicious the wood even pizza is . I think the thing I love the most about it is somethings I never thought like Chicken or meat sauce would be good on a pizza but guess what it's not just good it's delicious!!! Now last but not least I have never been to such a already beautiful and great restaurant to where the service is so amazing and hospitality like this place is . All the way to the great hosting , to the bartender, the services and even the cook . From the moment I walk in where I get greeted to the moment I sit down and get served . Lets just say overAll this is one of my favorite Italian restaurants and I recommend that you all get your butts over there and try it . Btw I was there just this past week or so and they have this amazing cute and talented singer there now Friday and Saturday nights that performs anywhere from 50s to 80s music and I never enjoyed that like I do there . It suits the restaurant so well it just fits . Well you all can't listen to just what I say ... Go check it out and see how good it is for yourselves . Enjoy:)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderfully light salad with wedding soup that was delicious.  The pizza crust was just right.... Service and atmosphere was very nice for a great lunch out"}
{"text":"Yum!  An awesome Italian restaurant in the middle of sketch-ville.

Tonight I tried the cheese ravioli (take out), and was pretty impressed... Impressed enough to tell everyone at work they might have been the best ravioli I've ever had.

All of their pastas are homemade, and it shows.  The pasta was light, fresh and delicious, as was the cheese inside.  The sauce screamed fresh, and had the perfect spicy bite to it.

An added bonus were the little pita-like things that I suppose come with all entrees.  They came from the wood fire oven, which smelled incredible while inside the restaurant.

Here's the deal... it's not the best part of town, but you won't get stabbed or mugged here, so park your car and come inside for some gooooooood food."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as gets!  Probably would give four and half stars but since I liked it a little more than that I'm glad yelp sticks to whole stars and not fractions of them.  Great pizza, with broccoli my favorite vegetable, is what you'll find on this menu!  And at 10 bucks for a small, which could easily feed two people your wallet certainly won't be giving you grief.  Oh, and the vodka penne pasta was so rich is was like a dessert but in pasta form, fantastic-ness-ism-astic!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! The food was absolutely delicious!! I had the chicken romantica, it was the best Italian food I have had in a long, long time. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for tasty Italian food."}
{"text":"A great place to go with either the family or date night. The food was absolutely amazing! One of the best meals I've had in a very long time. Excellent chef, great service, and a cozy beautiful atmosphere. I would highly recommend coming here and can't wait to come back myself!"}

{"text":"If only I didnt live so far from here. And if only they gave me the recipe for that onion appetizer!"}
{"text":"Suck it, Pizzeria Bianco.  There's a new joint in town and you don't stand a chance.
A friend pestered us to visit this hidden gem and I have yet to figure out how to thank him.  The pizza is a must-have--it equals pies I've eaten in Rome and Torino--but the rest of the menu is impressive as well.  One our first visit, the specials were seafood based and we tried 'em both.  A sole with with artichokes, capers, and a white wine sauce was perfectly cooked, and the scampi-like shrimp was darn near as good.  Others have applauded the complimentary appetizers so I'll simply agree and move on; the pizza Margherita was the star of my meal.  A thin crispy/chewy crust covered with crushed tomatoes, dotted with cheese and sprinkled with fresh basil was a gustatory Italian vacation.  Oh, and order dessert even if you have to have it surgically implanted.
The atmosphere belies the dodgy location.  The decor is both upscale (granite tables, tile floors) and mundane (a flat screen tv hovers overhead, tuned to an Italian satellite station).  Yes, I wouldn't walk home from here after dark, but parking is close and well-lighted, and the squeamish can use the freeway to be safely back in their suburbs in minutes."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at this establishment. The pizza was very tasty, and the portion size was generous. Great service from Diana, and the outside dining was a plus."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and we love the place.  The complimentary appetizer is fabulous and it is a lovely intimate setting!  The food is fresh, the pizza is outstanding and the salads, pasta and sauce are fabulous.  There are so few places like this in the east valley.  We can't wait to try more items!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Not great. Been here twice and not impressed. The crust of the pizza is unusually chewy and I always find hard pieces hidden in the dough. The Margarita pizza is bland. There are 3 better pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"Everything we had - from the Saporita pizza to the lasagne - felt like a homemade Italian meal. The service was very good and the atmosphere was fun and inviting."}
{"text":"The pizza is very very good, we've tried all of them on the menu and the crust and sauce are superb.  Tried the pasta once and it was not good at all.  Stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great environment! I've had pizza at many places in Arizona, and they all have a lot of work to do to catch up. Though i did not expect much from this place from the looks of it, i was pleasantly surprised. I have been there several times now, and will continue in the future."}
{"text":"What a great Pizza joint! Will be coming back for sure. Great service and my pie was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with class! If you didn't know it was there, you would drive right past it. Ordered a pizza from the brick oven, and it was great! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots in Phoenix, always fresh ingredients and super nice staff!"}
{"text":"I always have drove by this place without a second thought and I finally decided to give it a try. OMG what I have been missing this whole time!! I recommend the meat lover pizza and the metro size pizza is perfect for group gatherings and reasonably priced. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, especially when straight from the oven (versus takeout) - crust is thin and chewy.  The sausage used for the pizza is very good.  The ingredients are fresh and high quality.  The pastas are also good, esp. penne alla vodka and gnochhi.  Only negative is that the price is not what you would expect for the location - but the food justifies it.  Also, the chairs are hard - but that doesn't matter much when the food is good!"}
{"text":"The Honeycomb and I stopped in for pizza this eve because it's near our house and had great reviews here. Ordered the Penne alla Vodka pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil, cream and vodka and damn near blew my load. It's awfully good."}
{"text":"Just had Metro's pizza delivered via door dash and 100% satisfied with what I received. Haven't had great pizza that can be delivered in years more so had to call and talked to Alex. Nicely done Metro,nicely done"}
{"text":"Nice ambience and they give you an immediate bounce back discount for reviews! We had a couple of pizza's, glasses of red wine, and caesar salads for an excellent price."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, upon first appearance it's not really a place I would want to stay and dine in. It's very dark and not very  welcoming. We ordered pizza and pasta. We ordered a small pizza but they gave us a large and the price of the pasta was $4 more than what it said online. I'm not sure why???? Anyway the pizza was good I will probably continue to only order takeout.




Second visit.... Messed up our to go order again.... Wow!

Unfortunately we ordered takeout again and surprise surprise the order was incorrect. The service there is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good had pepperoni and mushroom, another time had the pasta a la vodka, really good a bit salty due to all the bacon, but still really good, will go back.  Neighborhood not so great, you will most likely be asked for spare change."}
{"text":"ordered a pizza an some pasta.  Gnocci was ok.  not the best we had but not bad by any means.  we had a pizza on another trip and it was pretty good. not the best in the valley but wood fired so that is a bonus.  Good for carry out."}
{"text":"X-mas eve '09. Many places were closed or stupidly crowded.I ventured into Pizza A Metro on Thomas w/my hungry date & had the best dinner experience the valley could offer.Every dish from apps to desert  were delicious. Service was great.You dick-heads that were tortured in some foo-foo joint should be ashamed.Try anything on this menu ASAP.---PS Don't let the exterior fool you.   KC"}
{"text":"Wow. Where has this place been hiding? It is located in a ghetto strip mall. but the inside is very nice and the food is incredible! 

Take a few friends to this place and you will be a hero for finding the best hidden gem downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally decided to give this place a shot.  I'm a creature of habit so I'm afraid to try someplace new and be disappointed. But we were both actually surprised! I got the ravioli which was delicious. The waitress told us the pasta for this plate and a few other entrées is made in house. The only negative was that I wished there was more! It was so good. My husband got a pizza and loved that too. We went for an early dinner because we brought our young kids but about halfway through there was a musician setting up for live music. My daughter thought it was pretty cool. Overall, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"We were there for dinner. Very cozy , warm and peaceful place. Food is just amazing! Highly recomend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I asked for a side of marinara sauce to dip my pizza crust in. It made great pizza amazing pizza! Don't go with a large group, the restaurant is so tiny inside."}
{"text":"Pizza A Metro is tha BOMB!!.... to start with this is in a bad area(block). It's hiding in a tiny strip mall with a Circle K in it. This is a bit pricey considering where it's located but not over priced for the food quality. This has a very small piece of Italy inside the doors and great customer service. I ordered the vodka penne and it was GREAT!! I love beacon... (who doesn't??) and cheese!! My guest ordered veal cav???otti... something like that... and it was also awesome. Bread kept coming and our drinks stayed full. I left thinking it was really great food and a very pleasant experience. I did see a HUGE pizza being made while I was eating and next time I really want to try one of those. (Would be awesome for a bear get together)!! I will be eating here again and look forward to that HUGE pizza. The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 star was due to location. I have to admit though that I do love to find these out of the way places with superb  food and surprise people from out of town. To see the look on their faces..... (PRICELESS)!!!"}
{"text":"Driven by this restaurant 1000 times and finally decided to try it. It seems like it is a family owned, family run restaurant. There weren't many people in there, but I can't figure out why (it was a Tuesday night).   The food was excellent and the service was great as well. I really like the flat screen TVs that were scrolling pictures of the many different dishes. It gave me a good idea of what to order the next time I go in. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We love having this restaurant in our neighborhood. The gnocchi is AMAZING! I have had the pizza prior to the gnocchi, but now I mainly go there for the best pasta I have had in the valley. If you want a high quality authentic Italian, you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant in what might have once been a convenience store. The pasta was good, filling and competent, better than an Olive Garden but not particularly amazing or memorable.    It was something with vodka sauce.

The real specialty of this spot is the wood-fired pizzas! House made mozzarella, sauce and dough. I had the meter long pizza (that's right a 3  foot long wood fired pizza) with sausage and basil, best pizza I've had."}
{"text":"Who ever said this place was just as good as Cibo, has got to be out of their mind. Aside from being in a terrible neighborhood the pizza was just okay. For take try Pino's we give them Pino's 5 starts. For dine in Cibo is our go to place and absolutely deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pizza A Metro, a tiny restaurant in a tiny strip mall, is definitely better than your Olive Gardens, but how the heck it has a 4.5 star average rating on here I don't know. It's just not that exceptional. It started out bad when the water tasted like dish soap. The bread and caponata is the best thing they have going here. Our $10 caprese was cheap mozzarella on pale tomatoes...for that price, I expect burrata mozz on beefsteak tomatoes. The pasta primavera ($13)  was very good, in a nice light garlic white wine sauce. Chicken marsala ($15) was good, not great, as was the accompanying pasta alfredo. Everything's about $2-3 overpriced, given that this is just a slightly above average neighborhood place. I won't be rushing back, but I would be okay going here if someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is near my neighborhood and when it opened, the owner brought a few pizzas to our neighborhood organization meeting. That was really nice and of course good marketing.

When I have friends and family in from out of town, I always take them there. We walk.  Okay, I know the surrounding block is scary, but what do you expect right next to the I-17.  One block east, and either north or south from there, you have nice neighborhoods. Like mine. ;-) And it's fun to be able to walk there.

Last time I was there, a guy other than the original owner took our order. He claimed that he is the \"new\" owner. Not sure what to think, but I really liked the first guy because when he is in charge, everything is prepared perfectly!"}
{"text":"It's all about the oven! Wood fired brick oven I'm guessing. Excellent Pizza!!  If you ever wanted to prove the saying \"don't judge a book by the cover\" this would be the place! I've driven past here a hundred times a didn't think twice.  Then I got hold of a Pizza Top 10 list and this was on it.  I even tried coming here twice before and left without coming inside.  I wish I would have.  I will definitely be back for more!  Also the interior isn't what you would expect, it is very tasteful. Woohoo,  I got a new pizza destination."}
{"text":"We ordered the antipasti, bolognese pizza, and the vodka sauce penne pasta. The antipasti plate was a big disappointment. The overall general taste was that of food from a can. But, the pizza was tasty. very tasty!
Nice crust, fresh tasting sauce, good cheese fired in a wood burning oven. The pasta was very good also. This place is  small but comfortable. The owner was there and was very attentive to our table."}
{"text":"Update * tonight We ordered take out and it was pretty good and my husband said all the lights were on and the staff was more on it so we try this place again though the prices are pretty high in our opinion. 

We visited this place for the first time in the early evening. The place is very well decorated and designed. It was romantic. They provide filtered water at the table. That's the end of the good stuff. As the time drew on it started to get darker in the restaurant and they have all kinds of lovely lights hanging around the room and at the bar but I guess because we were the only ones in the place it wasn't worth turning on the lights the atmosphere was very dark and uninviting. The waitress didn't know if they carried certain things at the bar and wouldn't offer to go check. By the time we left they decided to turn on one light next to our table... It just felt weird. The only thing I can for a reason is that it was a slow Sunday with the B staff."}
{"text":"Stopped here in a whim as we have driven by several times before but never ventured in. Very happy we did! This is now our new favorite pizza spot. We went around 230 on Sunday so nobody there. Pizza was prefect and staff was great. Spotless everywhere including restrooms. Thin crust not too much sauce and fresh toppings. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Every time I have driven by this place, I just assumed that it couldn't possibly be any good being based in this neighborhood, right off the 17 at the Thomas exit. Nevertheless, the reviews say otherwise, so I trusted them and gave it a shot. I called in a takeout order for a large cheese pie, and the staff member asked me if I wanted the 16-inch (I think) round pie or the (didn't understand what he said) square pie. I told him let's go for the square pie, and he said it would be ready in 20-25 minutes. When I got there 25 minutes later he told me my pie was ready and showed me a 3 FOOT LONG PIE IN A 3 1/2 FOOT LONG BOX. It was amazing! It was also only $27 & lasted me for 3 days, so the size wasn't a problem and it was a great deal. However, that wasn't even the best part - their pizza is fantastic! They make a nice soft chewy thin crust that is great when it's hot and doesn't turn into cardboard or worse in the refrigerator overnight, and the sauce is very...\"Happy\"? \"Bright\"? I'm not sure what word I would use to describe it, but it was delicious. The next time I go I'll order the round pie that is a more manageable size, and in the meantime I will keep the large square pie in mind if I ever need to bring lunch to some office or something where lots of people will be eating. Just don't leave anything in your back seat when you pick it up because you will need the room for the giant box! :)"}
{"text":"Truly a diamond in the rough. The pasta with vodka sauce had my tastebuds jivin' and toes curlin'"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the curb appeal or lack thereof. The food is really good! I always get the spaghetti bolognese. This restaurant is actually very small. I think it only has 2-3 tables. I order to go."}
{"text":"Good salad, good soup, great pizza, crust was perfect, service very pleasant...I will be back."}
{"text":"Terrific wood-fired pizza.  Made fast at high temps - as wood-fired pizza always is. That makes it ready in a jiffy for pick-up.  However,  you need to get there fast, and get home just as quick, to get it in your pie-hole before it turns into a pumpkin.  

For, as everyone familiar with the Thermodynamics of Pizza knows, the thin units cool fast and sublimate from a combination of different states of matter: crispy good crust. hot liquid sauce and piping plasma cheese into one solid block of cool 'za.  The moment is lost like a melted snowflake.  You should really be prepared to wish upon that shooting star as you drive home.

Anyway, try the Frescolina.  It's a classic from Naples with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula.  It is wonderful.  You know, it's like eating a pizza with a salad on it.  

Following the antiquated \"Dad-logic\", you can tell yourself that the healthy salad negates the ill-effects of the fatty, carby 'za.  Really, this pizza is not greasy or fatty, and the crust is thin enough that the carbs are quite limited compared to the standard American faire.  

It is really, really good gourmet pizza.  The best you will ever find next to a Circle K.  That I can assure you."}
{"text":"good service, great tasty food and a very friendly athmosphere. I totally recomend it, specially for the pizza lovers"}
{"text":"Pizza AND Beer are here atPizza A Metro!!  They just got their liquor license and  I was apparently the first person to order a beer.  I have to say that it went perfectly with my Pizza.
I can't really say anything else that the other yelpers have said so I'm keeping this one short.
Service was friendly and attentive.
The pizza was great.
The place was clean.
The beer (although the selection was limited to bud light and coors light) was refreshing.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is my first negative restaurant review ever! I have never felt the need to write a negative review until I visited Pizza A Metro in Gilbert.....

HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE experience!  I visited this restaurant twice and regret it!

LUNCH EXPERIENCE: My mom and I were passing by the restaurant at noon on a Wednesday, and decided to have lunch.  When we entered the restaurant, it was empty except for two single customers already eating their lunch.  We waited for a few minutes and then a man finally acknowledged us and told us to sit anywhere. Once we were seated, we waited a while for the waiter to come over.  He took our drink order (iced tea and coffee) and left the table.  Then he finally brought menus over.  He brought the dinner menu, so I asked for a lunch menu.  He disappeared into the kitchen for a while and then finally brought us lunch menus.  He mumbled something about only having seven lunch menus and they were hard to find.  Once he finally took our order, we waited a ridiculously long time for our lunch.  All we ordered was one pizza to share......it should not have taken that long as there was no one in the restaurant. The pizza was terrible.  It was dry, hardly any topping, and way too burned.  We should have sent it back, but we didn't have the time to wait again.  When the waiter brought the bill, he told us that he was not used to customers coming in at lunch.  Usually lunch time in his cleaning time in the restaurant.  Who says something like that to a customer?  Sorry, buddy, didn't mean to put you out.  

DINNER EXPERIENCE: Last Friday night, my husband and I decided to give Pizza A Metro a second chance.  (Very bad decision)
We arrived at the restaurant at 5:30. Once again, when we stepped into the restaurant, there was no one to greet us.  We waited several minutes and finally a cranky waitress told us to find a table.  Once seated, it was 15 minutes before someone brought water to our table. It was another 5 minutes before our drink orders were taken and menus were given to us. We ordered iced teas and the waitress said she would be back.  This was at 5:50 and she did not return to take our order until 6:15.  While we are doing all this waiting, customers are coming in, giving drink and food orders, and being served their food.  This is all before our order was even taken.  These other customers all came in after us.  Many of them 20 minutes or more after us.  Once our food order was taken at 6:15, the waitress returned at 6:30 to tell us that our food would be out in one minute.  Well, one minute turned into 30 minutes.  Our waitress disappeared from the dining room after she told us our food would be out. Where did she go??  We waited, and no one else approached us or brought our food out.  We tried to flag someone down, but no one would look our way.  Just before 7:00, my husband got up and found a waitress and told her we had been waiting for our food for 45 minutes.  She went into the kitchen and immediately brought our food to our table at 7:00pm. The food was terrible.  My cannelloni pasta (boxed) was mushy and had way too much sauce on it. My husbands pasta with beef tenderloin was pasty and the beef was way overcooked.  I am sure these plates had been sitting under the heat lamp in the kitchen for more than 30 minutes.  This was a disgrace!  No one ever came to our table to ask how the food was or even refill our teas.  We did not see our waitress until about 7:15 when she brought the bill to our table.  When I mentioned to her how disappointing the service had been that evening, her response to me was \"take a look around, it is busy in here\".  Really??? She disappeared for 45 minutes, didn't bring out food, doesn't even attempt to apologize, and then says that to me??  We left at 7:25 pm. 

My take on this restaurant:  very disorganized, bad customer service, bad attitudes, bad food.The prices at this restaurant are outrageous considering the bad service and the food they are serving.  

If you are going to survive as a restaurant, you need to train your wait staff, get a hostess, get a bus person, get organized in the kitchen, and get better attitudes.  Oh yes, and start serving food that is good.  

Good luck!
We will not be back."}
{"text":"Me + Pizza A Metro= FOODGASMS!!!  
My boyfriend and I stopped into a local aquarium and just before leaving the man who worked there suggested Pizza A Metro to us as we had been talking about lunch the whole time.

Unfortunately that day we already had lunch in the car so we went back Saturday evening.  I am going to send the guy at the aquarium a pizza or something.  Literally.

Our server was more than helpful, brought out the bread bruschetta style and that set the tone for the evening!!! 

The attention to detail was outstanding.  We ordered an appetizer of Calamari fritta, the marinara was so fresh you could distinguish every ingredient and was bright and vibrant.  

I am one who doesn't really like to go out to eat.  I know I am very picky, and pretentious, and I will be less than nice if the food is bad... So that whole ugly picture- I like to avoid.  Hard to because I come from a long line of properly trained French chefs, and myself am a chef/ restauranteur as well.

I have NEVER EVER given a restaurant 5 stars, but today I would give this little eatery 6!

From the moment you walk in, the interior is not what you would expect from the so often mentioned neighborhood.  OK, so!  

The colors are a warm neutral tone, and flow well into the wood wine rack that spans the height of the wall to your right of the door, the blinds match up to that rack and there is an overall harmony throughout.  

When you walk into this 8-9 table restaurant you are greeted first by the smell of fresh pizza being fired in the wood oven, and then by a friendly waiter who made sure every thing we could want or need was taken care of before we had a chance to want for it.  

Our pizza, thin crispy crust without being dry or crunchy was topped with mozzarella, artichoke, black olives, and prosciutto and was heaven! 

For desert I ordered a slice of their tiramisu, and was again blown away.  The flavors were balanced and sung together like an orchestra!  Oh amazing! 
I was impressed by this little gem, and the icing on my tiramisu, another table asked the waiter to let them pay for my dessert!  The overall atmosphere was warm, and inviting- even the other patrons were awesome!

At the end of our meal and after having eaten all of that I expected to feel 'heavy and drowsy'.  I instead felt sated, comfortable and overwhelmingly satisfied in the experience.

This place rose above with the atmosphere, (warm + inviting) exceptional food, (I am still eating the pizza!), and with the customer service which was also exceptional!  

We will be customers for years to come."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a must try. Amazing food. Great variety of higher end Italian dishes. Super good."}
{"text":"We love this place! The pizza is phenomenal but the chicken Marsala is to die for!! Always a win ! Love the people who run it and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Yum!   I would agree with the other reviews that mention that the looks of the location can be deceiving.   Next to the circle K it looks like nothing special but the pizza was excellent.  Thin crust, wood fired, doesn't get much better.   Really enjoyed it while staying in Midtown on vacation."}
{"text":"Greeted right away but then made to wait a long wait to place an order and then for food to come out (for no apparent reasons), service is so so, overpriced as others have stated.  

The food was not made to order and became cold at my dinner table with only 5 mins of driving.  

Not sure why it took so long for cold spaghetti.  Non riesco a sopportare quelli che non prendono seriamente il cibo.  

We won't be able to give a good review on this one."}
{"text":"Logo looks mediocre, so bad that I thought like a dominos. Pizza is actually decent but the waiter with long hair is quite disrespectful, will not go here again because of said service.....and I live next door."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Do not be afraid of asking for something that's not even on the menu.  They will make it if they can.  I sometimes go in there and ask them to surprise me with a Veggie meal, or a unique dessert.  They made me an incredible Nutella, Dessert Pizza.  The Chef is very passionate about his work.  He put's love into every dish.  Service, ambiance, and decor are also top knotch.  Best of all, The food is AMAZING!!! Every single item on the menu  that i've tried is delicious!  Pizza, Pasta, Burgers, and many unique dishes!"}
{"text":"We were referred to Pizza A Metro by the hertz rental car girl at the airport. She said that if we didn't mind eating in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, we would love this place. She was right. If it had turned out to be my last meal, it would have been worth it. 
Caesar salad and margherita pizza were amazing. Service and presentation of the meal was A++.  There are only 6 tables in the joint so I don't know how easy it would be to get in at the lunch hour. If you do get in, you will want to stay and savor every aspect of the dining experience."}
{"text":"After reading other yelp reviews of this restaurant, I just had to check it out.
My friend and I went for lunch the other day and were VERY pleased with the food and service.  We shared the prosciutto pizza and mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.  WOW, soo delicious!  The pizza was soo fresh and the crust was amazing, very light, almost flaky.  We were stuffed when we left, vowing to return!!"}
{"text":"So curious me, I had to see what all the Yelpabaloo was about (yeah, that's a new Yelp-ism - be sure to jot it down for your next review), and I must admit, this place lived up to the hype for me. It's a little outside my normal dining zone, but since I was downtown with my lil bro seeing a movie at Arizona Center, we decided to stop by on our way home.

The vegetarian pizza was delicious. Loaded with fresh veggies, including artichoke hearts, on top of an incredible thin & crispy crust, I just wish I'd ordered a larger size so I'd have more leftovers. Don't get me wrong, the portions are generous, I just wanted more.

There's definitely more on the menu than pizza, including pasta and calzones, which, after watching a few being served around me and listening to the oohs and ahhs while they were consumed, I will definitely be ordering next time.

The place is small - very small, less than a dozen tables - so I imagine it probably fills up quickly in the evenings. So small in fact that several conversations were restaurant wide - creating quite the communal dining experience - one of which involved Yelp. The owner's a big fan, as several patrons including myself mentioned it as their reason for checking them out.

My lil bro's review: \"Awesome.\" The only thing that would have made it better, he said, were video games. Who can argue with that?"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and for the most part the food is good, especially the pizza. The DOWNFALL is the service. We must have been here 6 or so times and there service is consistently BAD!!! We usually sit for about 10 minutes before anyone offers drinks even though many servers walk by and just smile. We have to ask for plates for the bread, drinks finally get dropped off but just on the corner of the table, not at all near the persons that ordered them, and then have to ask for straws. They seem like they have never served a table before in their life and are not real sure what to do.  It is a shame since the food is pretty good.  No one seems concerned though so we will see how long they last."}
{"text":"Cute little place. We live in a neighborhood just adjacent to this place and have been driving by it forever. I really like to support local businesses so we finally decided to give it a try. I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews but it ended up being a pleasant experience. Our server greeted us at the door and gave us the option of sitting indoors or out on the patio. The indoor ambience was very quaint, quiet, and nicely decorated but we elected to sit on the spacious and very cute patio. We ordered the pesto chicken pizza, the smoked chicken rigatoni, the fettuccine carbonara, and the pear salad to split between myself, my husband, and my 14 yr old son. Prior to the entrees we were served bread and what I am assuming was marinara sauce. However, the bread was cold and the marinara was a cold paste. I've never been served cold marinara paste and did not care for it. The entrees arrived in a timely manner although the pizza arrived about 10 min after the pasta dishes. We weren't bothered by that but something to consider....the pizzas take a bit longer. The pear salad: just \"so-so\". The salad dressing was a bit bland and I'd skip it next time. The Smoked chicken fettuccine was good....not great, but If you like fettuccine Alfredo, you will like this dish. The fettuccine carbonara was also good. The chicken pesto pizza was good but we felt the crust was a little undercooked in the middle. Bottom line: we weren't completing impressed but will definitely give this place another try because of the atmosphere, the friendly service we received, and the fact we live only a few minutes away. We thought the food was \"good\"....not fantastic but we are anxious to give it another try based on other positive reviews."}
{"text":"I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.  

In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.

My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it."}
{"text":"First time ever writing a review and felt this experience was that necessary to do so. My parents had been before and loved it and unfortunately dragged me with them this time. Our whole party will not be back after tonight. To sum it up service was so slow, the atmosphere was horrible, and the only reason we gave it 2 stars was for the just edible pizza.  We waited about 45 minutes for some really salty calamari and a ceaser salad served with ranch. My parents said just 1 month ago things were so much better. Sad to see where it is going and we will not be back"}
{"text":"Pizza A Metro is the ultimate hole in the wall! (I love hole in the walls!)  Located in a smaller shopping strip marked with a vintage style pizza street sign you can expect to find an Italian oasis.  This adorable little restaurant features only four tables inside and two tables outside. (Packed and no time to wait?  Don't worry you can take out as well.)  Adding to the ambiance was the owner who greeted us upon arrival with a heavy Italian accent and loads of charm.  

I was impressed with the bread plate that we received shortly after ordering.  It was a little preview of the fabulousness that is Pizza A Metro's Pizza Crust. Yum!  While everything we ate (salad, veggie pizza, and spaghetti) was divine, I am quite sure their was some kind of addictive substance in Pizza A Metro's spaghetti.  I don't usually find restaurant spaghetti intoxicating but this is an exception!

Go to Pizza A Metro, take a friend, share lots of food, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance. The food. Not so good. We were told it would be 20 min for Table it was closer to an hour. If the would have just given us some updates on the wait we could have made the desicion to leave or stay as we had hungry children with us. The hostess pretty much ignored us but she was really busy. The wait was not worth the food. Chicken wings were really bad. The Ruben was billed to have spicy coleslaw on it (no coleslaw) and it was just flavorless. Maybe this place is more about the birds than the food"}
{"text":"Yup it's me again.....the person without the picture whos' opinion you might not be abale to trust but I will give my opinion anyway....after reading all the rave reviews on... Pizza Pizza Yelp about it.....I had to give Pizza Metro a try.....it was absolutely wonderful...who knew...certainly not me.

We made a reservation although on a Tuesday not needed but we were told that it is a good idea for Thursday, Friday and Saturday. We took our own wine (only a $5.00 corking fee).....The owner and his manager Michael were VERY friendly and went out of their way to make sure that we were taken care. They brought us a plate of flat bread with a mix of capers, onions, eggplant that was very yummy (sorry to you pleople that it tasted like tap water...I have to disagree).....we then shared a ceasar salad again more than enough for two....we had such a hard time deciding on entrees that we wound up splitting the lasagna and a meatball pizza (not really meatballs but rather homemade sausage)....all of it was out of this world and the lasagna was probably the best I have ever had....the pizza was wood fired with the perfect amount of topping....all homemade. All in all a great dinner leaving us comfortable full but not miserable....it will become one of our haunts and we are looking forward to trying their new restaurant \"Amarone\" which we have been told will have a full bar and a larger establishment and a little more upscale.....Thanks to all who wrote their reviews and made us curious enough to give it a try...

P.S.....TOTAL BILL ONLY $32.00...and they are working on their liquor license which they hope to have in a few weeks"}
{"text":"Have been here a handful of times with my Hubby for lunch. I would have never given this place a 2nd look, but its literally a 2 minute drive from my work so I thought why not? Glad I did because Pizza A Metro is the bomb!!

We have tried a variety of dishes but our 2 favs have to be the Penne alla Vodka & the Capricciosa pizza, so freakin delish!! Oh & their salads are pretty yummy too. The bread they give you is tasty as well.

We hadn't been here in a few months but on our most recent trip this past Wednesday, it seemed to be under new ownership. Sad-I really loved the spunky, lil Italian dude with pretty blue eyes!

If you have never been, give it a try, you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"This place really cracked me up with all the juxtapositions it had. First of all, this has to be the tiniest sit down restaurant I've ever been to. It was almost as if we were eating in a phone booth. That being said, it wasn't uncomfortable at all; just funny when you looked around and realized how small it was. Also, inspite of it's tininess, the furnishings and how it was decorated was really nice, like to the point where it was noticeable, and I really liked that. Also the food was absolutely amazing from the bread they brought out, to the pizza I had, to the calzone my friend had. They really really REALLY knew their way around an Italian kitchen. Which is funny to me because, not to be racist at all by any means, but there seemed to be only people who are Hispanic working there, which you don't usually expect to see, but even if they were Italian, they still exceeded my expectations of authentic cuisine and dining experience so I give them a lot of credit for being able to do that. And when I speak of authenticity, my minor in college was in Italian and based on that, I can vouch for them being more than competent in that dept. And for as great as the food was, the prices were totally fair too and that is probably the best $12 pizza you will find in the Phoenix area. It's definitely a hole in the wall type joint and the area it's in is nothing glamorous. The customers even seemed kinda rough looking and not the kind of people you would expect to see in a nice place like that (but otherwise very nice and cool people), but add all of that to the pile of juxtapositions to this place that have really caused me to like it all the more because of that and give it a well deserved 5 stars. Also our server was incredibly nice too. The only knock I would give it is that to get to the bathroom you have to go to the back in sort of the kitchen area, but there's not much they can really do about it since the place is so tiny and there's literally no other place they can put one. It is a nice bathroom though fwiw."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!

In fact, they make some of the best pizza I've ever had. The owner is Italian and definitely seems to know what he's doing.... they use a wood-fired oven, make fresh mozzarella daily, the sauce is to-die-for, and the crust is absolute perfection!"}
{"text":"Chef Alex has a passion for cooking, and serving his community. He was accommodation and warm. His staff is friendly and the food is DELISH! Pizza A Metro is hosting our wedding/reception next month and Chef Alex, Nshan, and the friendly staff have made it very easy. I will post pictures and updates after our event! Thank you Alex!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great, and in such an unexpected location.  I work over here, and I am thrilled to find a great place to each lunch.  Working on the West side means not many lunch choices for sure.  I called in my order of a pepperoni pizza.  When I arrived, I was greeted with smiles, hellos, offered water and tea.  I actually got to watch them make my pizza.  I was concerned at first thinking, I called this in, why isn't it done, but it only took five minutes to make.  They use fresh dough, fresh homemade sauce, and using the pizza oven took no more than five minutes.
I will be back here many times for sure....totally impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent Margarita pizza. Caesar salad not drowning in dressing. 
This place is coming along nicely. Love the ambiance. Great staff."}
{"text":"It's hard to really fault this place. The pizza is so good and the prices are totally down to earth for what you're getting. There are a few places in the upper echelon of pizza making the Valley of the Sun, but, this is one of them. There's not much room for seating so try to get there a bit early if you're trying to dodge a crowd."}
{"text":"Don't bother trying this place. For starters, we were greeted by a rude server who clearly didn't care we were there. She quickly informed us they only had bar or outside seating. We chose outside, but the 1 heater for the entire patio was out of propane so we moved ourselves inside. There were dirty dishes everywhere, clearly they had no bussers, or a bar tender, or hostess. Our server got away with the bare minimum and made no suggestions on what to order. This new place won't be around long. At least the food was ok, after waiting about 45 minutes to get it."}
{"text":"Pizza is absolutely amazing!! Came back today for the 2nd time this week. Would refer this to anyone that loves wood fire cooked pizza"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Amazing workers!! Reasonable prices for gourmet food! Cute local restaurant!! We try to go at least once a week! Best sangria in town!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best Pizza in the entire valley. The Burgers are especially delicious! Definitely a spot for the FOOD enthusiast.  The chef is very passionate about his work.  The Ambiance,  decor, and service is also excellent."}
{"text":"While the entrees that I have experienced at Pizza A Metro (the penne, the ravioli) were merely competent, their pizza is truly a work of art, one that rivals Bianco's. Unlike Bianco's, however, you don't have to wait three hours to get your food. As a matter of fact, if you phone it in, it'll probably be waiting for you when you arrive. And what a treat! A real Neapolitan Margherita pizza, thin, springy crust wood-fired perfectly and topped with a light sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella and basil. This is food heaven to me.

As far as the location goes, I don't understand what the big deal is. It's right next to I-17, and everything around is all freeway stuff. Gas station, Circle-K, Jack in the Box and Days Inn. Grubby? Yes. The ghetto? No, not really."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good, really I did.  I got the cheese ravioli with marinara and it wasn't anything special.  Though to be fair, my favorite is the Fazoli's cheese ravioli.  

It was basically just not worth any hype that I could see.  Maybe the pizza or cream sauces are where it's at and I missed out, but unfortunately I doubt I'll be willing to try again.

The guy in charge was very friendly but it was annoying how inattentive the original waiter was especially considering how small the place is."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  A little expensive for the ambiance. The restaurant is very small somewhat clean,  but the food was very good. We came to celebrate the Sinaloence's birthday. This is a hole in the wall restaurant which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Were from El Paso, TX & every time we come to Phoenix this is a must stop place for us to dine at. Try it, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Wood fired Meatlover's pizza was delicious. Also enjoyed the cheese ravioli. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Love the ambience, attentive service, and food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I go in an Italian restaurant, managed by Italians, I always hope of having a beautiful experience. It just didn't happen here. 

It is a shame when an Italian serves overcooked pasta. 

We ordered an eggplant parmigiana and one margherita pizza. The eggplant was breaded which is nice but was kind of raw, you could see the inside of the eggplant still a little on the green side. 
The pasta that came with the parmigiana was absolutely gross.... way over cooked and the sauce was really thick and dark in color. 

The pizza was just ok... i had better, the crust missed any kind of wood flavor... you know that kind of charred flavor you get from a wood burning oven. the sauce was a bit acidic and the cheese tasted cheap. 

Overall i don't get the hype about pizza a metro. The service was nice but not enough to make me go back"}
{"text":"Bad, bad customer service, we bought Lcal Flavor coupons for $30 worth of good and we're turned away! No longer accepting Local Flavor yet today 3/17/17 I can still go on-line to Local Flavor and purchase discount coupons today. I think the scam is most  people would not walk away dissapointed and stay for dinnerer and pay full price. Thats the scam. The so-called manager gave us many excuses and would not honor purchases bought in the past,. And, if u go to local flavor website you can buy coupons today and be turned away. So unfair. At least honor past purchases. I'll just call Joe On Your Side News channel for help with the indignance of Pizza  A Metro. So do not buy discount coupons u will be denied at this restaurant. We live near by and always wondered how they stay in business as they r never busy! Keep turning away customers and you will fold. Oh thank you Carrabbas for great food and saving our evening!"}
{"text":"A little known secret of locals.  The only other place you can get a NY pizza outside of under the subway in Brooklyn, NY is right here.  The pasta dishes are soooo delicious, and the homemade Caesar salad is the way any Caeser should taste.  Once you try the good here it will by far be one of your favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed one of the best breakfast, I have ever had.  Actually, it was not even on the menu.  Alex, the executive chef, just put it together for us.  Poached egg yolks on a roll, with a wonderful tomato Hollandaise sauce, thick sliced bacon and hash browns.  I have been there 3 times and every time has been a winner.  BTW, try their lobster sandwich, it will blow your mind.
When you go in, say hello to Alex, and tell him, Nick said hello.  Knowing Alex, there maybe a little treat for you"}
{"text":"Our experience there was so good. We moved to the East valley and I have to say I miss this place the most, my husband probably would say haus murphys. This place is the hole in the wall jewel and you are pleasantly surprised as you walk in. It's nice staff, good decor, and great pizza should have everyone there. Only drawback of the place is the location and the Circle K next to Pizza A Metro has seen better days and better patrons.

We had pizza the first time and the wood fired pizza there is like no other. it's so good and yummy. We filled up on the complimentary bread, had a great fried calamari appetizer and the salad we shared was great. We ordered a pizza ( the regular) and we split it to have veggie with bolognese sauce and my husband got the meats with the bolognese sauce. My half of the pizza was great but the meats was fantastic! Our creme brulee was good and the desserts are well secondary to the great pizza so no problem. Truly a great chef works here and the owner sat and talked with us about the restaurant as we were finishing up our meal. Such a nice guy and great staff!

We had a football party the next time we ordered from there. We ordered the biggest pizza METRO SIZE and they didn't disappoint. It was huge!!! Our meats with bolognese sauce was a hit! I love bolognese and everyone told me what a great pizza it was. We had nothing left after the party and that is a good sign for their pizza.

Whenever we are on the west side or well the 17, we will have to draw straws on picking a place but I know this will be my pick! You can't go wrong with wood fired pizza and this place makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal tonite. My wife is Italian and makes her own gnocchi. She says they have excellent gnocchi here and I agree. Their Marinara Sauce is some of the best we've tasted. I can't speak for others who have posted bad reviews but we'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Italian we have had in a long time.  Chicken Parm finished in the wood fired oven....wow!  That in itself adds a complexity to the dish found nowhere else.  Marinara made in house, perfectly cooked pasta, delicate Ravioli, this is one not to miss!   Do not be put off by the location, or the funky and tiny interior...these guys can cook Italian!
OR...Goodyear"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff ! Great, artisan wood fired pizza. Bread and Italian \" salsa\" were perfect appetizer."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely AMAZING lunch today! The food was phenomenal and the service was top notch. Some of the best Italian food in the valley. If you're looking for authentic tiramisu, this is the place to go. Have searched the state for the best and finally found it. The lemoncello cake was to die for!!! Alex is the BEST!!!  GO CUBS!!!!!!! BTW, if you like Italian Wedding Soup, have Alex make you a bowl..."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic dinner at Pizza A Metro this evening.  The Chicken Romantica and Caprese Burger were very tasty, the service was excellent.  The prices are very reasonable.  We highly recommend this place for dinner.  We cannot wait coming back for lunch next time."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix looking for a good pizza \"joint\" and choose this place on recommedation of other yelpers! We arrived at about 9:30 on a friday night and our party of 4 was able to snag the only open table. The place is small with 7-8 tables and next t o a Circle K so it is not much to look at! We ordered and mozzarella & tomato app which was perfectly fine good cheese, ripe tomatos. They offer three sizes of pizzas, small, medium and HUGE (39 inches in diameter) . They were \"Sold Out\" of the medium size so were were forced to pay much more by ordering two smalls to split instead. We were told they make all the dough crusts in the morning so once a size sells out that is it for the day!  We ordered a plain cheese and a sausage and broccoli. The pizza arrived hot and crispy to prefection! The tomato sauce was very tasty. Three of us agreed that the mozzarella, while very tasty and good quality, did not seem to fit as pizza cheese. We were sure it was the same cheese used in the appetizer and seemed better suited fo that kind of nosh. On the pizza it seemed to almost turn waxy! But still it was tasty! The sausage was very good and off high quality. Overall worth a trip here!"}
{"text":"What is this place doing here?!? Found on the corner of a slum strip of stores including a circle K and a dollar store so pointless that it must be some kind of front, the teeny nugget of gold known as Pizza a Metro (named for their meter long pizza) has been feeding my family now for several years. They have several pasta dishes (my favorite is the Spaghetti Bolognese) that are flawless. The pizzas are made in a brick oven. The bread is so very light and lovely; the sauce, bright and tangy. My favorite pizza is the Saporita which has a homemade sausage and broccoli. This place even offers calamari and fabulous salads. The owner Mauro is an immigrant from Tuscany. I am thankful that he brought us this lovely restaurant. The only thing I would change - no fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Honestly though, I've had the pleasure of living in Italy for several months and this restaurant made me feel like I was back there again. The food is fantastic. I would recommend the veal cannelloni or any of the other homemade pastas.

The ambiance is the real kicker at this restaurant. It only had a few tables and fills up quickly (just like a real Italian restaurant) and the service is wonderful. Go treat yourself."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday to try out the new owners....The wait was STILL HORRIBLE.
We were sat right away...got in our drink and Apptz order with in 10 min....then it went down hill. Our waiter explained that there was only 1 cook tonight so things were taking a long time. He was nice and funny and good to the kids, so it was fine....UNTIL  40 minutes later still no Calamari..then my husbands salad came out first.
I ordered my second glass of wine and we were ensured the Calamari was on it's way..Finally got it and it was great. When we asked how much longer for the pizza he said \"honestly I can not say\". We debated about just canceling the pizza and paying for what we had, and told our waiter that was what we wanted.. he returned 2 min later and said our pizza was coming. It did and it was great.......THEN when the bill came my son wanted to pay so he gave the waiter the debit card when he brought us the bill. The waiter kinda joked and said don't you want to check your bill and make sure it is all good? He chuckled and I said No I am sure it is fine. Plus I could check it when it comes back to sign it.....Low and behold when it cam back my hubby checked it and they charged us for 3 wines....not 2! We pointed this out and the waiter said he would see what he could do. He came back and said that his manager would NOT do anything, that it was our fault for not pre checking the tab   WTH!!!
I have worked in the restaurant business for a long time.That manager could do whatever he wanted..Like void the transaction and do it over..Nope he would not we were told the only way to get our $ back was to take it out of the tip.
Needless to say We will NEVER go back and I tell everyone I know about this, because it is just wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Average at best.. Nothing that chuckie cheese can't do for half the price."}
{"text":"I came in because I've heard great things about their pizza but ended up trying the caprese panini and it was perfection. The restaurant is beautiful and staff is really nice. Will definitely come back to try the pizza..."}
{"text":"Tiny, almost no parking ... HUGE pizzas for the price! I knocked off a star for canned black olives. Seriously, why would you sully a good wood fired pizza with nasty Thanksgiving nightmare canned black olives? That's heresy. Kalamata. Please.  The staff and owner are so nice that I wanted to love this place but unfortunately the pizza just isn't that good."}
{"text":"95 reviews? Guess there's nothing I can say about this gem that hasn't been said. We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good. 

We also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon, tomatoes and fresh basil. The vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well. They included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew I was staying at a hotel. They were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us. 

It says on their website and on the yelp search engine that Pizza A Metro delivers but they don't. Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! My pizza margherita (to go) was delicious. Thin, crispy crust, nice quality mozzarella, basil chiffonade, and flavorful tomato sauce (very lightly sauced). The delightful hostess made us feel welcomed. My only regret is that we didn't order two pizzas!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Awesome service! Definitely going back. Had the supreme and the margarita pizza. Both were excellent. Bread appetizer was soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Going back to Pizza A Metro is a no brainer. Great italian food. Tried a special Grilled Pork  with Gorgonzola sauce which was great. I would not randomly select dishes at most places but here there is so little chance of getting a miss. Service and setup is great."}
{"text":"I love this place. We were originally going to another local joint but it was extremely busy. So, my wife and I decided to check out Pizza A Metro for the first time. The staff was very friendly and service was quick. We ordered Caesar salads and a 16\" pepperoni pizza. The food was incredible, one of the best pizzas in town. The atmosphere is soothing and inviting. Also, I highly recommend the iced green tea. Overall, we had a pleasant experience and will return again soon."}
{"text":"I had my doubts.
Some family and I had found ourselves in Phoenix somewhat unexpectedly, and when looking for places to eat I turned to yelp. There appeared to be some doubt among my relatives as to the wisdom of trusting people on the internet.

This was not helped when we pulled up and realized that the restaurant is in a strip mall attached to a gas station. Luckily, we went in. We then spent the next hour having not only the best pizza I've tasted in AZ, but some of the most entertaining service of my life.

A real treat."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing.  The Atmosphere is simply perfect for any occasion.  Staff is very attentive,customer service is A++++.  The food is simply amazing.  Cant wait to go back again.  Telling all my friends, family and coworkers.  This is the place to be. Great food, Fantastic Staff."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Gilbert from California. My husband and I love wood oven pizza and decided to give this place a try. I would have to say this is the best pizza we've had by far!  We ordered the Margherita pizza and it was delicious. Many varieties to choose from and all made to order. Great staff and atmosphere. They need to work a little harder on the service, but I gotta tell you that it has improved immensely in the past few weeks. I fell in love with their cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. It's a must try. Last week they started serving complimentary sides of hummus and eggplant caviar with freshly baked bread as a starter. Although not Italian dishes I certainly hope they keep serving it because they tasted heavenly. We even purchased an order of the eggplant caviar to go. Another great plus to this amazing family owned restaurant is that they deliver and we get to enjoy our favorite dishes at a comfort of our own home when we don't feel like eating out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I only went there because the reviews were so good- its not in the best little stripmall but I live right down the street, so I was willing to try it. I have never had anything there that was less than excellent. The pizza is great, the pasta is excellent and even the stuff like the chicken rollatini, which I usually wouldn't get, was amazing. Everything is super well done and authentic. I loved it all! I wish this place great success, unless it gets too busy and I can't get in anymore :)  It is a kind of small space so calling in for a reservation isn't a bad idea."}
{"text":"Came into this place on whim, fell in love instantly. Not only was the atmosphere amazing, but so was the food, and the service? HANDS DOWN THE BEST SERVICE WE'VE EVER RECEIVED!!!! We will definitely be coming back to this place time and time again."}
{"text":"Very good food! Everything we ordered was delicious. This is a small family Resturaunt but don't be fooled by its size... These guys are doing a great job! Try it you will be very impressed!"}
{"text":"Definitely good pizza. Staff was sOo friendly. Well more like the owner. He was chit chatting with my friend and and was throwing out all these innovative secret menu items since he knew we were from LA and did yelp reviews. lolz

Ended with a blue cheese pizza with white sauce, basil, beef carpacchio and red onions. Taste was definitely different from what i've had. Very original and had that amazing brick oven toast to the crust. 

A joint like this would totally rock in Arizona but wouldn't fly in Hollywood area due to competition. I do hope they get their names out because the owner puts alot of heart into the pizza.Love it!! food is all about bringing people together and here I was.

Price gears towards working class. Should definitely expand capacity to accommodate a bigger crowd."}
{"text":"Don't eat the anchovies! I went there on 8/3/13 in the afternoon ordered a 16\" with anchovies on half. Place was cool, had a Rolling Rock and kicked back till it was done. Didn't think much about it when the guy making my pizza and another kitchen guy were having a discussion about a blue and white rectangular can, ended up being the  anchovies. He used them on my pizza and threw them away, opened a new can. Obviously the fire wasn't hot enough cause he kept putting more wood in it. I took home my under cooked, germ ridden, toxic pizza and ate half of it. The fun kicked in about thirty minutes prior to catching a morning flight on 8/4/13. It's now 8/7/13 and I've been in constant contact with many different restrooms since then, it just will not stop, missed some work, had an IV for dehydration. At least the headaches, sweating and vomiting has stopped."}
{"text":"Our second visit to Pizza A Metro did not disappoint! Such great atmosphere, friendly service and delish food. The homemade tiramisu was excellent!  Can't wait to enjoy the patio and a glass of wine when the weather cools down...looks so cozy and inviting!"}
{"text":"our a/c died. parts had to be ordered. so we made the hotel rounds: 3 of them in 5 days. one of those hotels was downtown. it was terrible. the only bright spot that night was the dinners we had delivered to our room from Pizza A Metro. Victor, the owner, delivered them himself. Eggplant parma and linguini carbonara were perfect! 

we will never stay at that hotel again, but we will definitely be having more meals at this restaurant. Great Italian food from a italiano-phyle!!!"}
{"text":"Do Not Go if you have Local Flavor!!!!!! There is a made up sign on the door saying they don't accept because of \"company issues\", when asked what \"issues\" the server didn't even know. If this \"Business\" is trying to promote themselves you sure went the wrong way about it, you should at least honor the offers. BAD BUSINESS!!!"}
{"text":"don't get me wrong, I'm still a HUGE fan of this place!! Whenever I'm on that side of town, I whimper at the thought of not being able to go here. Damn economy! *sigh* 

But recently, I had my chance... to yet again dwell in the goodness that is Pizza a Metro. and GOOD GOOGLY MOOGLY!!! That's a HUGE pie!! A good friend and I went there when he said that he wanted a LOT of food. \"I want to order a small have a whole trough come to the table!\" Not feeling the Heart Attack Grill, I convinced my friend to try PIzza a Metro. We did and it was wonderful! A little to loud for our liking - we really needed to shout to hear one another. But we loved it. 

We shared the gnocchi with vodka sauce and I could just feel the world being lifted off my shoulders!! haha! He never had gnocchi before I feel I may have ruined him for it forever. Then we had the Pizza a Metro with three different types of toppings! THREE feet of pizza ya'll!! It was a shit load of food!! I couldn't believe it! Three feet of Sausage w/broccoli, arugula & procutto, and various meat toppings! It took up most of the table! We dug in and by the end of the night, most of that bad boy was gone! I couldn't believe we ate that much! 

Oh and if that wasn't enough - our waiter told us of the various desserts! Desserts he said... we had to try the creme brulee - my FAVORITE dessert ever! and it was burnt! And undercooked at the same time! I couldn't believe it. I was so disappoitned! But I didn't let it ruin our great night. 

We still talked until most of the lights were out. And we laughed over everything. It was a great night. I'm so glad we went. The food was as good as I remember it. To my yelpers I say GO!! but skip the creme brulee!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem... 
In a time where chain restaurants dominate, nice to have a little local joint where you can feel welcome"}
{"text":"4 1/2 Stars.
I found this little place while searching online and am I ever glad I did.  
I started with a Insalata Mista (mixed greens) and was thrilled with what came out of the kitchen.  Excellent sized portion with super fresh ingredients and the best dressing I can remember eating, not swimming in dressing, not dry, perfect.
The vegetarian pizza that I ordered  was medium sized and a very good value with a variety of fresh toppings.  The eggplant was diced to the perfect size and gave the veggie pizza a \"meaty\" texture.  The only negative aspect to the pizza (and to the entire meal) was that it was a bit undercooked.  I would have sent it back to the the wood fired oven for a another few minutes but I knew that I would be putting the leftovers in the oven at home so it would be okay.
I took the homemade pasta lasagne home to hubby and have not heard a review yet from him.
I will be back.  No big groups here...there are only 4 tables for 2 and 3 tables for 4.
Note: the neighborhood of this tiny little restaurant is a little sketchy...take a buddy if you go after dark and can't park right in front."}
{"text":"We were in Italy last summer and haven't found pizza that tasted like true Italian until this one. We had the green salad and Marghetia pizza. Both were amazing. Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Great clams and linguini and The lasagna is fabulous. However the service is really bad. If your in a hurry not the place for you."}
{"text":"Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy."}
{"text":"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.

However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.

The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.

The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.

All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Caesar salad pizza, thinking that sounded intriguing enough to give it a shot. What I got was a pizza with plain romaine lettuce dumped on it - no chicken, no Caesar dressing. When I discovered there was no chicken, I inquired of the server, who told me that chicken is optional on the chicken Caesar salad pizza.

At this point I thought perhaps he was joking. But he was not. He offered to get the manager, and after an absence of about 10 minutes, he returned to tell me that the manager had run to the store. 

It turns out the manger was the chicken. 

He should have been on my f****** pizza."}
{"text":"Perfect place.  The service is over the top! Food is fantastic ! Great wine selection. Just love the atmosphere and it is so close to home. Every thing is clean and staff is very friendly. I recommend eating here. Its a cant go wrong place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem,  the pizza is amazing.  The Ametro pizza is perfect for a dinner party its a meter long and serves a huge hungry bunch of people.  Everything is fresh and delish.  Im glad they are right down the street from us.  Finally a great pizza place in central Phx!!"}
{"text":"We made a 2nd visit to Pizza a Metro last evening, Saturday.  On our first visit about a year ago, we agreed the food was delicious and atmosphere is inviting.  I hesitated to return because of poor reviews here, mostly regarding slow and unfriendly service.  But we ventured to try it again anyway.  As soon as we entered a young man greeted us, introduced himself, and said that Francisco would be our waiter.  Francisco arrived at our table immediately, and he was quite pleasant and efficient. Our drinks and water were served without delay.  We shared a Caesar salad which contained very crisp and cold romaine and dressing very good and the correct amount. Our entrees were served very soon after the salad, no waiting here. I ordered chicken marsala with vegetables and roasted potatoes - sauce delicious and plentiful, sides very good as well.  My husband ordered lasagna.  It is served a bit different to lasagna he is accustomed to, but he said it was quite good and he ate every last bit.  We had no complaints regarding service, which was more than friendly, or food which is delicious.  It appears that the owner has made improvements. For sure Alex is a talented chef.  I hope our Gilbert residents and others venture to try Pizza a Metro.  With the changes now in effect, you should not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the lasagna and it was amazing. The sauce reminded me of this when I was in Italy. I will definitely go back

The only thing I would have liked to see is a vegetable or side along with the main course. Bread was served though"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and made from scratch. This chef has the magic touch to anything he makes. We went for pizza and he had us try a few items just to get our opinion, they are all fantastic. This is one place I can get better than making it myself and that's saying alot. The service is wonderful as well, making the experience above satisfactory."}
{"text":"Starting my summer off right at Pizza-A-Metro!!! Red Sangria and Spaghetti w/meatballs were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Want great pizza, drive an extra 2 miles east on Thomas and go to Pino's Pizaa al centro. Want OK pizza, come to Pizza a Metro. The place is TINY. I mean Tiny. No bathroom. Most of the Restaurant is the kitchen, which, frankly is a shame because the food they put out doesn't warrant that much kitchen space. But my big gripe -- Why bother to put in a wood burning oven if your Pizza is going to be soggy and short on flavor? You could do this right, easily."}
{"text":"Just a great little restaurant with good service. I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage and veggies and it was delicious. With a nice glass of red wine only $21, very reasonable. I'll be back to try their pizzas and homemade tiramisu!"}
{"text":"On a recent business trip to Phoenix I had a dinner at this small restaurant. At first I had planned to just carry out a pizza, but once I arrived I decided to dine in, since the small place looked very cosy. The place has a good reputation for pizza (they are prepared in a stone oven visible from where you sit), but I opted for the Sicilian spaghetti dish with vegetables, Italian sausage and tomato sauce. Before I received my dish I was served some warm flatbread with a nice vegetable salsa. The spaghetti was fabulous: tasty sauce, fresh veggies and spicy slices of sausage. The pasta was nicely cooked as well (al dente). Overall this restaurant was a very nice surprise and with reasonable prices. It looks like it's family run with the friendly owners serving and cooking. I need to return here on my next visit to Phoenix to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"We just ate there tonight.  The food was really good.  I felt it was authentic Italian food.  We had the pizza, calzone, penne with vodka sauce, and the Eggplant Parmesan.  It was all great!  Unfortunately there was some issues if fixed would make this a 5 star restaurant.  As many has said in their reviews, the service is sooooo slow.  It absolutely was not our servers fault.  He was working his bum off.  I feel this is greed of the company at the customers expense and the employees.  The place was packed and ONLY had 3 servers total.  Not only that...these servers had to go behind the bar and make all their own bar drinks.  Our poor server was flustered and spread thin.  Another problem was that we had 3 kids and no kids meal on the menu.  Plus with the long wait they had no coloring or anything for them to do.  Lastly, for the price of the meals, serve some bread before the meal or offer a side salad for a small price.  I'm not gonna pay $11.00 for a salad.  It would of made more sense for a $15.00 Eggplant Parmesan.  I will come back for the food but I would choose a better time to come.  Stop being greedy and get more servers and a friggin bartender.  Our poor server."}
{"text":"There it was; cornered with the ratty Circle K that obviously needs the armed gaurd outside. Their sign in comparison was claaaassssy. Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways, and obviously based on all previous reviews it went the right way.

Our server had classically italian shoes, and Anthony Bourdain hair. Mixed with his jovial european attitude and accent, he was perfectly cool as all get out.

I felt like Tony Soprano, if The Sopranos was written by Kevin Smith and the mobsters discussed comic books with their generally bandanad currently little black dressed friend Amanda B.

The atmosphere is quaint and the food would help you get over the death of your italian grandmother. The pizza is divine, The imperfect look of the lasagna says this is going to be better than making out with the head cheerleader behind the bleachers in high school (I assume. I talk about comic books so this has never happened to me).

The raw beef whatcha call it, while not for everyone, is it for me. Perfectly lemony, perfectly fresh, perfectly refreshing and tasty. 

The table behind us had brought their own wine, which I will certainly do next time and assume that if there is a corking fee it is resonable.

Speaking of reasonable, the prices were incredibly low for the quality of the food. Must have something to do with the heavily gaurded circle k next door."}
{"text":"We loved it! The atmosphere was really nice, very well decorated, and the food was delicious.  I got a pizza and my wife got a pasta.  Both were great.  The cheese cake tasted very good, very homemade.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wish I could post negative stars for the Gilbert Pizza a Metro location. Went last night with family for an anniversary dinner. Restaurant was empty for a Saturday night, which should have been the first clue. Menu was completely different from the original location in Phoenix, which should have been the second clue. When I questioned the change in menu with the server, he explained they were under new management. At this point I should have left, but decided to give them a chance. There was only one server, but that shouldn't have been a problem, since there were only three other tables plus us. It took a ridiculous amount of time for the server to bring us water, and our drink order.  After getting our food order in, we sat there for over an hour waiting for the food. My son ordered a pizza, which the cook left sitting at the edge of the oven, while he finished the rest of the meals. This caused half of the pizza to be rock hard and burnt.  Two of us ordered the homemade raviolis which did not taste homemade and were most definitely not fresh. Grandpa ordered the spaghetti with sausage which had more sausage than spaghetti. Not sure why they skimped on the spaghetti, because it was not fresh made either. My brother ordered chicken parmigiana. The server brought out chicken piccata instead. When my brother told the server it was the wrong dish, the server said \"oh sh*t\", right in front of my 4 year old granddaughter.  All of the meals were mediocre at best. I could have microwaved some Marie Calendar frozen dinners and been just as satisfied. To say that the anniversary celebration was ruined is an understatement. I had only been to the Phoenix location on Thomas, and was expecting the same melt in your mouth homemade pasta. Even if I wasn't comparing the Gilbert location to the original, I still would not have been satisfied with the food and service.  Not sure why Gilbert is allowed to use the Pizza a Metro name, because they do not serve a meter of pizza and they do not have fresh made pasta. I will not return and plan on calling the Phx location to let him know they are tainting the restaurant name."}
{"text":"After growing up in Italy, now moved to Phoenix.. I never imagined a local spot having such authentic Italian food!! My wood-fired pizza was impeccable and the service was outstanding! This will defiantly be somewhere I will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite italian joint.  They had some minor problems when we went for lunch.  The air conditioning was on the fritz and the entrees didn't all come out at the same time, but the food & service was awesome.  I felt like I was in Italy, which was impressive considering I was on the west side next to a Circle K.

I ordered the veal cannelloni ($8.95).  By the way, everything is $8.95 for lunch.  The portion size was perfect.  The pasta and ingredients all tasted very fresh.  Delicious.  The focaccia bread we started with was also homemade and very yummy.

The other guys I went with ordered the pizza with sausage and broccoli and said it was awesome.  Sadly I didn't have enough room in my stomach having devoured my entire meal, but I will definitely try that next time.

*No liquor license yet."}
{"text":"So there are a ton of reviews on this place so there isn't much more I can give praise on that already hasn't been written...so without further adieu,  I had the meatball pizza and liked it.   Food review done.  

Now what I really want to write about this place is that I don't think it's not going to be around much longer.  It's in a less than desirable part of town, which usually doesn't spell doom necessarily but in this case it really doesn't fit in with the local flavor of pawn shops/payday loans/fast food chains all over the place.  This place can hang with the Pizzeria Biancos, Cibos and Humble Pies of Phoenix, but it's not getting the numbers of patrons it needs to thrive.  I watched as the owner nervously peered out the the front glass as potential customers just walked on by as if it were the SB 1070 Fan Club headquarters.  The owner was great to us.  He greeted us immediately,  was  really attentive and felt authentic with his thick Mediterranean accent.  

Again, the only problem I observed was that we were the only ones in the place for the whole hour we were there.  It was on a Thursday night but still...  I'm hoping I'll be able to eat there again in the future."}
{"text":"The food is solid and the owner is really nice. We went on a slow day and found the service to not be as attentive as we would have preferred. But all and all, a good experience."}
{"text":"what a great experience. The mussels with garlic sauce and the fried calamaris are simply fantastic. I was born in a coastal city in Brazil so I understand about sea food and I can assure you this was the best mussels I had since I moved to the USA 6 years ago. The pizza was also very good and the service was also good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at this establishment and its definitely not my last. I walk in alone to eat since I was early for my appointment at the salon. I had the Marsala polo and it was delicious!!! Great customer service and the atmosphere was very chic and clean."}
{"text":"Awful, slow service.  Nobody ever asked us we want to drink.  They just brought a bunch of waters.  Then a kid brought out unwrapped straws in his bare hands and stuck them in our drinks.  Two of the menus were empty. 
The waitress came to take our orders, still no asking about drinks.  Had to walk inside to get a drink menu.  30 minutes later we get pizza and 2 beers. It was very flavorless and the crust was just caked in powdery flour.  Also the waitress' long, untied hair touched the edge of the   Pizza when she put it down on the table. An hour later nobody had come back to refill waters, get more beers, or check how the food was.  We had to flag down a waitress to finally get our drinks and chase her down to give her payment.  
It's like a rich kid decided he wanted to open a restaurant and hired all his high school friends to run the place."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and definitely will be back. The pizza was  delicious. The crust was just right. They also gave us a free appetizer and it was really good.  The waiter was also very friendly and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"They make the best cheese and anchovy pizza in the city!  Great food in a very interesting location.  Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times now. Always unbelievably good! We ate there once,quite cute and quiet. Very small inside, It smells wonderful inside as well.  I love to get it to go though. The Pizza crust is amazing. Love everything we have ever ordered here. Salads, pasta and the Pizza. It is located in a rough little shopping center, but so worth going there. My most favorite Pizza shop."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had in the valley!! Amazing service, Sam is awesome! Margarita is so sweet and very personable. She even let us sample a new wine she was adding to the list, it was so delicious!! This is probably our new favorite restaurant! It feels so good to find a place where they care so much about their customers!! This is a must in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Guys. Don't go here. The service was atrocious, and the food was yucky. The table next to us had been there for 90 minutes and never got a scrap of food - they just left empty handed and hungry. We got our good after an hour - some of our food, that is. My husband didn't get his til after we had asked for the check. This place will probably be closed in no time. Sad but true. :("}
{"text":"Food is fantastic restaurant staff are great even with the poor location I give it five stars."}
{"text":"Don't judge the place by the location!  Just go inside and you won't regret it.  Best Italian I've ever had hands down.  I had the pleasure of dining here while in town for business and I dream of my next trip to Phoenix just so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"Waitress named Brittany M.  was terrible.  Treated us like we were at a Chuck-E-Cheese.  Other wait staff appeared well trained and were helpful to other tables which made it worse.  We were served red wine in a white wine glass, and asked for it to be changed.  We then  realized that she had shorted us wine compared to other people who had ordered wine by the glass in the restaurant- their glasses 3/4 of the way full... ours 1/4.  It appeared she was just too lazy to open another bottle.  Also she was no help in describing the menu/sauces/etc... She also ignored us three times when we tried to get her attention, never refilled our glasses, and only brought us bread once- not offering more.  For this type of menu/price, I expect more with regard to service.  Fazoli's wait-staff is more accommodating and has a better attitude.

With regard to the food... Pizzas have been good at take out, but inconsistent.  For example, variations in thickness of prosciutto (sometimes thick/thin) and cook on the crust (sometimes well charred, other times under-cooked for this style). 
 
We had dine-in pasta last night.  The portion size with regard to the past is lacking, and so is the ambiance for a $16 + plate of pasta.  The veal cannelloni was well done (a tad bit salty), but the shrimp scampi pasta lacked flavor on the whole.  In reality, portion sizes were approximately appetizer/tapas size at other nice Italian restaurants.  Even at $12 a plate, I would consider these portion sizes too small.

Overall,  if you're willing to roll the dice with service, and are willing to pay more for a little, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Well, we waited 45 minutes to get 3 dinners and the pizza was not correct, the fettuccini had no broccoli, the second pizza was really good but by the time I got it, i was not hungry. The service and hospitality was great, I just wish the food was quicker and done right. I don't think I will return here. There are other places that for the money, would make sure it was correct."}
{"text":"This place is really great. I have had pizza and pasta all over the country and I have to say this place is really, really great!!!!! We had pizza, pasta, salads, calamari, capresse (sp?) and a bottle of Italian wine, enough for the 10 of us and it was cheaper than the breakfast we had at Denny's earlier.
I don't know about the guy who reviewed it earlier from NY, but obviously he does NOT know what pizza is supposed to taste like, because this pizza was the one of the best I have ever had. In fact,as we are only in Phoenix for one more day, we are going back for dinner tonight and ordering all different items!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back.  We went there with a large group of people, and the service and, most importantly, the food were excellent.  Their chef can customize the menu selections, and everything tastes fresh and healthy.  It makes me crave their pizza now when I think about it:). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another fantastic dinner. Had Creme of zucchini soup to start, excellent is an understatement .. then the best pizza in Arizona..."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizza is a Neapolitan style with a great thin crispy crust and good toppings. One of my personal favorites is the chicken Parmesan. One thing is it is very small so I always get my food to go."}
{"text":"Food, decor, and service was wonderful! Pizza light and tasty reminded me of being in Italy. Not like greasy American crap. They served bread with a salsa before hand. My kids enjoyed it. The ambiance is off putting in that is far to quiet for a pizzeria. They need some music or something to make it not feel like a library."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Metro pizza\" (19\" X 39\")  for one of the guys here in the office.. The look on everyone's faces was priceless.  To see this MASSIVE pizza come in was great.  I have also uploaded a pic of it."}
{"text":"My Girl friend and I walked in thinking it would be a normal pizza sports bar type resturaunt, as it does have sports playing the feeling and vibe is way more fancy. 

The waiter was very kind and even recommended his favorite appatizer which was astounding! The fried kalamari! We also ordered the Napoli Pizza which had alot of very good flavors with tomorrow's and goat cheese. They're sauce might be the best thing about the pizza! 

We also got the Fumé wine and it was awesome ended the night with some chocolate moose. We wernent looking to spend as much as we did but it was a wonderful and delightful date night and well worth it!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this little hole in the wall couldn't have more than eight tables but they do a very good job of making Wood-Fired pies the flavor of the crust is yeast like the flavor of the sauce not overpowering of the pie and Lisa Pizza in the meter what's a little different prices aren't bad for to get the server is okay Tyra thing you needed"}
{"text":"Nice and tasty. I had the pizza supreme...it had too many toppings so the crust got a little soggy. Next time I'll order with only two toppings."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I was nervous about going.  But living so close I gave it a try.  I love this place!  

They had great wine, and Margarita (manager?) was very helpful in picking a wine that fit our tastes. The food was really great.  My husband got Carbonara and I got a Caprese salad.  Both were out really quick and were above my expectations.  Service was quick and attentive, we had a great dinner and were in and out in 30 minutes ( our style of eating ).

I live up the road, and am so excited to have a local close place to go!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Bianco what?

Oh, you wait 5 hours to get the pizza I get in 20 minutes.  That's cool.  The owner doesn't have free time to come and chat with you?  That's too bad.  

:)

In all seriousness, I do love pizzeria bianco, but this place is better.  Hand tossed, wood fired, fresh mozzarella , delicious proscuitto, fresh arugula.  I might have to go back tonight.    Their pizza is delicious.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for some awesome pizza."}
{"text":"First time coming herw; came here on a Monday night around 9 p.m. No one was here; my boyfriend and I chose to sit outside. The service was EXCELLENT and the food was perfect :) Our server was prompt and very friendly! We ordered a pizza; asked for different toppings on each half of the pizza and it was delicious. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have passed this place numerous times and finally stopped in to try it! Upon entering, I was excited!! Nice tablecloths and a lovely bar. However, after about 20 minutes, the one hostess/waiter/bartender came over to take our order. We ordered a caprese' salad, pepperoni pizza and a cannoli. Much like others' reviews, we LOVED the pizza. It was delicious! The mozzarella in the caprese was quite hard and the outer shell of the cannoli was extremely stale. The Spanish opera/choir and mariachi music that was blaring over the sound system was way too loud and seemed not at all in-line with the atmosphere of an Italian restaurant. The waiter was really nice but clearly overwhelmed with all 9 guests in the restaurant. Probably wise to order as takeout. We entered at 7pm and left at 8:40pm."}
{"text":"So I went here a few months ago and it was the best pizza I've had in a long time and the service was great.  Just went again tonight and it will be the last time going there.  The service was horrible.  The food was horrible. . Not once did we get an apology from the chef or manger.  We ordered mussels and clams as an appetizer and only got 8 clams.  The appetizer was around 14 bucks should have been about 10 each or so.  The owner told our waiter that he could only discount our meal 4 dollars because that's all the buttons allowed. On top of that our pizza cold and nasty.  Not going back"}
{"text":"There is no way any single restaurant can live up to the 5 stars of so many heavy-hitting Phoenix Yelpers, srsly. This place must be a myth. 

That's what I thought as we made our way down to the tiny (i mean, tiny) hole in the wall that is Pizza A Metro.

We got a pizza in the \"metro\" size, which basically means \"this is the inside dimension of our oven/this is the biggest pizza we can possibly make\" size.

I had a foodgasm, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I was, however, a little ashamed to do it in front of my best friend's mother. 

\"Oh, he's fine, Mom. He just really likes basil.\"

I cannot wait to go back and try everything on the menu.

Go. Go now. Your lunch/dinner plans have just been shanghaied. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Great staff and friendly food. Wait... What? Yeh... We enjoyed ourselves so much we stayed another two rounds. The staff was awesome, the drinks were perfect and the food... Deliciously deliciousness delicious. My wife had the prickly pear margarita. Sweet, tart and the perfect high-end tequila. Ask for the sugar rim instead of salt. Tones it down to a perfect blend of zeeeyyaaaouzza. Me...? Beer. The local San Tan Devils Ale. Great with the best ever zucchini sticks. Best we ever had. We're Going back very soon."}
{"text":"Thought it was casual pizza place, turns out it's quite nice. Other than that I have nothing good to say about it. Pizza came wrong, got sent back, and when the right pizza came back it was mushy. Two of our 3 orders aside from the pizza were correct, food was just alright. Nothing spectacular. They offered us a free dessert because of their mistakes. We ordered the chocolate mousse which turns out to be a store bought chocolate coconut cake I believe. They said they would take off the two items they messed up on, and didn't, so we had to dispute that. Whoever says it's a 5 star must be a family member or a friend."}
{"text":"Unassuming and deceiving: it doesn't have a real door (the plywood has been up for months) and it's next to a pretty sketchy looking Circle K* and it's TINY. But the food here is pretty fantastic. I usually get the calzone. Portions are huge and could probably make multiple meals. Highly recommended. 

*Is that redundant?"}
{"text":"Oh I'm in love and I didn't even try the pizza.

The fam and I ate here for my brother's birthday last week. I remember walking in and thinking I wasn't really in the mood for pasta..then a plate of italian flat bread was placed in front of me and the rest of the night was a complete blur. 
All I remember was drinking wine, eating bread, drinking wine, antipasto salad, ooo calamari fritti! more wine, delicious chicken special,more wine, tiramisu. All fabulous, all scrumptious. I want to eat here every day, and I want that chicken thing I ate. But I can't remember what it was called. Sorry. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding - I wish I had more time to write reviews of all the places I go - but I just wanted to share a quick review - in a nutshell - definitely a go to place!
Yes, the area is kind of shady - and its in a seedy little strip mall - but come on - if you are an adult then get over it.  
Food was great, service wonderful and accomodating.
Only \"negative\" was there isn't a bar you can sit at while waiting for your table.  We sat outside at the little table on the sidewalk and had a drink,  The owner told us that the crowd in the rest of the little stip mall wasn't the classiest.  It was totally fine.
I never saw the bill so I can't say for sure what the pricing was.  I am pretty sure it should be 2 $ signs.  
Some reviews say BYOB - but those reviews are very old and I think before the current owner.  You do not need to BYOB/W"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza that had little to no flavor and the crust was like wet cardboard and my daughter had a a hamburger that was burned on the outside and cold in the middle . Never going there again !!!!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever tasted! I mean who puts canned mushrooms on pizza?? YUCK!! If your name has pizza in it, I expect it to be the best thing on the menu so I hesitate to try anything else.  Never going back to that place again.  On a positive note, ambiance is great."}
{"text":"YUM.  Seriously.  Delicious.  The pizza was very good (only the final comparison to Pizzeria Bianco did it in - I would recommend getting the wood-fired oven at least another 50 degrees hotter to really crisp and blacken the crust), the pasta I had was awesome, and the dessert was to die for.  Oh yum.   

Scottsdale location opens next week, apparently, at 90th St and Via Linda.  Yum."}
{"text":"I, so LOVE Pizza A Metro. It's kind of a misnomer because their's is a complete Italian menu. The pastas are wonderful, the wine is good, and the service is friendly. This is a very classy place in a very dodgey location. But, don't be fooled by the neighborhood. Pizza a Metro is the best place in the city for Italian food!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date. Small and quaint place with great food and service. Pizza is authentic as you can get."}
{"text":"Best secret in Gilbert! This place truly is a hidden gem! Margarita is without a doubt the greatest person to ever run a restaurant! Every time we go, there's always a table available and the food the incredible. The real kicker is, the price. Dinner and drinks, in a great atmosphere with an incredible owner walking around checking on you....$40! If you have not been, you have to try it! Be patient.... everything is made fresh, so don't expect an in and out experience. Come for the food and stay for the people!"}
{"text":"Zero for service & recovery!! Plus, my pizza is NEVER right!! Although delicious, the one guy who answers the phones & runs the register, cannot write. Every time my order is wrong, his only argument (why are you arguing with regular clients) is \"I wrote it down\".   Whelp, you did it wrong, again! I've had enough. I'm so annoyed the good pizza isn't good enough. Goodbye Pizza Metro. It's been a rough 5 years."}
{"text":"We ended up here for Mother's Day dinner. Our family we were with lives in the area and had heard good things.  The place was packed and horribly understaffed. A little boy was seated at the hostess station on his iPhone half heartedly giving roses to the moms. Thanks? Our server Sally was fantastic but she was the only server for a full restaurant. There were some other kids running food and doing tasks that I assume were related to the owner but it felt like they were more in the way than actually helping. We arrived at 5:30 with 2 toddlers and didn't leave until 7:15. It took over an hour from when we ordered until our food arrived. My husband asked to speak to the owner. When he came out he made excuses and said he would ask the chef what was taking so long. But not once did we see the owner helping or working the restaurant. We did however see him smoking and talking on his cell phone. 

The chef came out and apologized and said he dropped all the food into a pot of oil. Seriously? Not one single table in the place had food. You dropped all the food in oil? And then said he would give us a free dessert. After we were complaining about how long we had been there no way we were sticking around with two (now tired) 2 year olds for a free cannoli. 

I honestly don't know if I've seen a more poorly managed restaurant. 

The really unfortunate thing is that the food was truly delicious but there's no way we will be back."}
{"text":"I went here last week for a take out order. It is small, seats about 20 people, the lights were dimmed, it was cozy and the gentleman at the counter was very nice. He suggested to me what was popular so I ordered the Margarita Pizza with prosciutto. It was a brick oven place and the pizza was finished in about 15 minutes. The crust is to die for and it's also a hand tossed/thin crust. They have a good selection on the menu as well. It's in a small strip mall and it looks as if it's in a bad area, but it is worth it. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place!  Spaghetti and meat balls and the chicken parmigiana were great.  Can't wait to come back and try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Really, really good pizzas and salads. Service was great and so was the food, the environment in this place was really cool. Would recommend this place good staff."}
{"text":"I'm so glad the reviews didn't let me down! Loved the pizza! Loved the price! $30 for the 39\" x 18\" pizza.  That was something to brag to the East coast pizza lovers about. The guy carried the pizza out to the car-- so nice.  People were starring at the drive-in...jealous with their stale popcorn. My two-year old nephew ate two big slices. That's a big deal bc he's picky. It's even good for leftovers."}
{"text":"My son and I were in town and went by Pizzeria Bianco and didn't want to wait 2 hours, so while on the way back to the hotel, my son used Yelp and found this little gem. The pizza was pretty good, and I had a pasta special that was quite good. The owner was very attentive.

The nearby table had ordered a large pizza, and they were served a slab that was 1' x 3' on a wooden plank. Very Impressive!

The only negative is that the guy cooking the pizzas should let them get a little browner (maybe even a little char) to make the taste more authentic."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the pizza & the pear salad is delicious although the portion(of the salad)is very small for the price. The sausage that came on our pizza was chicken sausage which we won't order again. Not a fan. Other than that, very good pizza. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I hate to jump on the bandwagon. But dang it, folks are right about this place!

We lurked around the front door this morning long enough for Mauricio to invite us in. Pizza A Metro sticks out like a sore thumb in this dirty old stripmall off the 17. It's clean and crisp on the outside, warm and inviting on the inside. 

Soccer was on the tele, and the kitchen crew was busy prepping for the lunch rush. We sat at one of the granite-topped tables and ordered a few bevvies. FYI, sodas come in 20 oz bottles, so while they are tastier than fountain, they are a bit more money.

We started off with a caesar salad. The dressing was spot-on, with just the right amount of anchovy. However it had no croutons, and could use some bigger parm bits.

We also enjoyed some really tasty sorta bruschetta things. They appeared to be scraps of pizza crust, accompanied by a sweet onion relish with -- I believe -- eggplant, celery, and a couple of fat capers and olive slices. As an olive-hater, I found this to be a refreshing change from tapenade.

Next we had the lasagne and a small pizza with prosciutto, mozz, and arugula. The \"small\" was HUGE! The crust was kind of on the thin side, and had a delicious chewiness to crustiness ratio. On the downside, I totally got shafted on the arugula. Instead, it was topped with spring mix. Not bad, but the bite of arugula would have been better.

The lasagna was delish. The sauce was probably the best part - lots of tomato and basil, and just the right amount of garlic.

Sadly, I was too full and tired for dessert. 

And good news for you Scottsdalians. We were told he's opening another shop up your way."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service, wine, pizza, and child's spaghetti and meatball were excellent. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is a considerable drive from where I live, however, I have eaten here twice and both times were an excellent experience.  Everything I had was delicious including a very delicately flavored soup that was quite filling despite appearing as though it wouldn't be."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!!! Being from NY I know good Italian food and this place is it. I've heard they have a place in Scottsdale also, but I have not been there."}
{"text":"With 89 reviews there isnt much more to say, everything you read below is true, food is truly amazing!  Dont be scared away but the 'ghetto' the entire dining area is tiny enough to have your vehical in sight the entire time you eat!"}
{"text":"Wow! Been here several times! Food is real good, I will agree, but it's not consistent. For the price paid for the chicken picatta, I'd expect more food. Salty one week, too sweet the next. Visited three times in two weeks. Out of beer, still out of beer, again out of beer. Are you closing? Trying to stretch the food with such small portions? Not going back again. Yesterday was their last chance, and they failed miserably."}
{"text":"So we're driving home from work today; ready to face the nasty rush hour traffic, when my husband tells me that there's a new place we have to try; Pizza A Metro.  He's a fan of the New Times, and particularly loves to read Savage Love...Hmmm?  He read a review on this relatively new restaurant which had very favorable comments.  Anyway, we LOVE to eat and are willing to go anywhere for good food.  Lucky for us, we work downtown and Pizza A Metro was within minutes.  The question was \"should we go home and eat Cocoa Pebbles for dinner or experience, what we would later that evening call \"The Best\" Italian restaurant in this city?  The question; ridiculous; the choice was obvious.

First we entered the tiny strip mall just East of I-17 on Thomas where this teeny little restaurant  sits.  Seriously though, if you blink you might miss it, so keep your eyes peeled.  The restaurant inside was really cute and super clean.  The few tables in the place were granite...nice touch.  Greeting us immediately was the owner, who was so welcoming and highly attentive.  
 
We began our meal with complementary flat bread that was fresh from the brick oven with a side of eggplant componata as a spread.  Both were so incredibly delicious, and truly set the tone for the rest of the meal that was to come.  We had the Calamari Fritti appetizer which was accompanied with the most amazing marinara dipping sauce.  My husband ordered a \"small\" pizza that's big enough for two people to share: a piping hot, beautiful wood fired pizza crust layered with red sauce, delicious, melty mozzarella, amazing sliced sausage and rapini.  Needless to say, the pizza was out of this world!

Ok, so just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I tasted my eggplant Parmesan that came with a side of pasta with marinara .  Honestly, this was sooo good that I thought I was going to cry.  I can't even put into words how delicious this dish was.  I really had to savor every bite and relish in the smooth eggplant that was covered with a blanket of mozzarella and divine marinara.  It was just sinfully good.  

This was truly a decadent feast with very reasonable prices.  I even got to practice my Italian with the owner.  If you haven't been, you must go and support this tiny restaurant.  Other than it's weird location, I couldn't find anything wrong with Pizza A Metro, as everything was oh so right.  Buon Apetito!!"}
{"text":"Caprese Salad was just so so. The tomatoes were similar to the type that you see on a burger and not enough basil or oil. 

LOVE the complimentary pizza crust bites and olive/tomato dip. the crust bites were soft puffs that made me excited for what the pizza will taste like. 

Pizza Meatball was delicious, great crust consistency and just the right amount of sauce to cheese to meatball ratio. 

I know its a small mom and pop restaurant, so I feel a bit bad for saying this, but I thought the service was too slow."}
{"text":"Terrible.  I asked for my dressing on the side and the waiter brought it saying \"I know you said on the side but this is how they made it.\"  The pizza had all the toppings in the center not spread about the pizza.  Toppings resembled lunch meat.  Would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall treasure. Pizza is very good and the staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We just ate at Pizza A Metro....amazing food and amazing service! !! We will be trading in all other pizza joints for this one :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here...SO TASTY!!! My mother-in-law (who lived in Italy for years) said it was phenomenal!!! Excellent waitstaff and very affordable. Not in the greatest location but who cares! The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places in town. Great pizza and friendly fast service. There is something amazing about getting a meter long pizza."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great surprise!!! We moved to the neighborhood about two years ago and always wondered how this little place would be and We were pleasantly surprised tonight. They have a great menu but just in case we ordered the wood fired meatball pizza.  We were not disappointed great Pizza, fresh salad and iced tea!!! Next time we will try the dishes everything smelled, looked and tasted great. It's great to have a little place like this close to our Historic neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had the wood fired pizza and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!! I will come again next time I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me and brought me here for dinner. I love Italian food and this place did not disappoint! I love my moms home made Italian food and the pizza and pasta here at pizza a metro tasted just like my moms home made food. The pizza melted in my mouth with the perfect amount of cheese and marinara sauce. The pasta was delicious with the right amount of seasonings. The server was very attentive and refilled our water and wine as needed. The chef stopped by our table and had a lovely conversation with us. With my mom living so far from me I know I will regularly be coming here with my boyfriend for this amazing food that brought back memories of my moms dinners. Can't wait till I bring her here as well."}
{"text":"The service was Absolutely horrible and inexperienced and the food was sub par at best. I'm in the restaurant business and I'm embarrassed for this restaurant. I can't believe they are still In business. What a waste of money!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice!  This establishment is tastefully decorated to resemble a metropolitan New York area restaurant.  The bar is large and fully stocked with top shelf alcohol.  The tables are graced with two color coordinated tablecloths.  Outside are tables with umbrellas and newly installed misters.  

The wood fired pizza is an excellent choice.  Pasta dishes sampled had generous portions, fresh grated cheese on top and just picked basil.  Very tasty.

They offer a $5.00 lunch special.  How can you beat that?   On weekends, there is live entertainment, a nice crowd and a friendly proprietor to greet you and make certain you are enjoying your food, service and experience."}
{"text":"How are you going to seriously compare this place to Cibo or Bianco? That is absolutely ludicrous. I have had this place on my list to try for quite a while and I feel not only disappointed but cheated. I wanted to experience what some of you five star reviewers had. Maybe I ordered wrong. 

I ordered the cheese raviolis with marinara, a regular Margarita with pepperoni, and a garden salad. 

The cheese raviolis had a nice flavor to them. Not too much sauce, the ravioli itself tasted pretty solid and the whole dish had an authentic taste to it. I personally would rather have Tutti Santis raviolis over them any day of the week as they are creamier and pack more flavor. Also, 15 bucks for 6 small raviolis is ridiculous. They are not hard to make and not even made with expensive ingredients. 

The poor pizza looked so plain in the box I was disappointed from the very start. I've honestly seen better looking pizza from Rosatis. However, it did have a nice flavor to it. The mozzarella really made it. As for a margarita it wasn't. It was basically a cheese pizza with pepperonis. Maybe a tiny speckle of basil and tomato here and there. And when I say a tiny speckle, I mean it. I was very disappointed. The bread was okay and the sauce was decent. Nothing that screamed it deserved to be compared to the best pizza parlors in AZ. Lets get real here. 

I'm not going to mention the side salad. It was what a side salad should be. To sum this up. For 45+ with a tip and for the quality and considering my expectations I would give this place a 2.5. Please stop comparing every decent at best pizza to Bianco, Cibo, LGO and others. This place is no where even on that level. I think Spinatos is way better. La Piazza Al Forna murders it. Shoot, even Grimaldis is more impressive."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and my recommendation is to have any of the pastas.  My friend had the lasagna and said the noodles just melted in his mouth.  I had the penne al vodka and the sauce was perfectly creamy.  

I had the pizza on my second visit and it was definitely good, but not the best I have had in this city. That being said, the tiny restaurant (there are literally only 5 to 6 tables all nestled against the kitchen) oozes charm.  

This place is hard to spot, but worth the try."}
{"text":"A little whole in the wall that serves decent pizza.  DEFINITELY not what I expected.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"We got to introduce 3 \"virgins\" to the wonders of PaM tonight- and they all agreed it was tremendous and fabulous. The gnocchi was pillowy and perfect, the saltimbocca was tender and rich, the mussels were fat and flavorful, the carbonara was snatched from its orderer and devoured by his girlfriend who loved what she ordered until she tasted his. The bread was great, as always, and the tapenade bowl was scraped clean. The calamari fritti was light and fresh, and one friend exclaimed that the accompanying marinara was the best she'd ever had. Even though they live in East Mesa, they'll be returning for sure. 

I think those of us who are regulars were concerned when Maurizio left to open Amarone. After all, he was such a big part of the charm and ambiance of the place. Let me tell you, the new GM Michael more than fills his shoes. Charming? You bet. Awesome accent? Check. Kind, accommodating, cool under pressure? Yes, yes, yes. Remembers you and your problems with tomatoes? Always. Tonight, I also brought in a cheesecake I had made for my friend (her favorite, and she now lives out of state) and without missing a beat, Michael offered to put it in the walk-in, even brought it out with candles, then took it back and served it to us on plates he decorated as if it were his own dessert. I was so impressed with his generosity. That's the kind of service and small town feel you get at Pizza a Metro. As long as we live here and the place is open, we'll continue to be regulars."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, don't even know why I am writing this review.  I wanted woodfire pizza, and unfortunately, there are few in the East valley.  The pizza could have been good if the crust was crispier and less chewy, even my dog had a hard time chewing it.  Also, I ordered a specialty drink \"cherry martini\"  Let's not get crazy folks!! This was marischino (sp) cherries with the juice, and vodka, tasted like a bad air freshener.  Also, the antipasto plate looked like everything was from a can, mushrooms, olives, eggplant, the only thing I liked was the mozzarella, but I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic, and some little bread points they had because without those fillers it would have been bland and I would have left hungry.  The ants and crickets jumping at my feet and biting my toes while on the patio had more personality than the server.

That's all!  I shouldn't go into an Italian restaurant and have to critique the whole menu.  How can pizza go wrong?"}
{"text":"Not as good as Pizzeria Bianco, but pretty damn good--and you don't have to wait 3 hours.
Try the giant metro pizza if you're throwing a party!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new Italian place around our house for ages. The fiance suggested we ride our bikes at sunset down the canal and try Pizza A Metro as my coworker suggested it. 

When we arrived the place was empty, which was surprising as it has a lovely location. We sat at the bar and the bartender, an older gentleman was kind, attentive, and explained the menu, his preferences, and a joy to talk to to. 

I went with a Sauv Blanc, which I quickly learned had something I was allergic to in it, so he got me a new glass of pinot, and was so kind about it. Hall went with a Firestone, we split a Caesar salad. The bread and garlic butter was phenomal. I tried the special, lobster ravioli and was very impressed, Hall has the smoked chicken pasta and the pasta (I didn't try the chicken) was divine. Our server let us know that the chef had infused the dish with smoke which gave it the amazing flavor. 

As we ate some other couples came in and joined us at the bar, all of which also loved our bartender and seemed to be regulars. 

We loved our experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! What luck to find it! Not only is the food outstanding, but the service is great too. Don't be turned away by the location, as we almost were. The reviews more than say, why this place is so fabulous! It's a small restaurant, I mean almost tiny, with about 7-8 tables with 4 chairs each. SMALL. But with that, comes highly attentive service. 

While you wait for your amazing meal, they bring out a delicious bruschetta with pizza crust to eat it with... YUM! To start we ordered an antipasto plate and wedding soup, I loved the antipasto, my first time having it and it was perfect! The soup was a bit different than I expected but delicious, all the same. Big chunks of meatball slices with veggies in a reddish broth, all that needs to be said is yum! For the main course we ordered a veggie pizza which was excellent! The pasta with mussels, my hubby loved. lasagna was friggin' awesome, tried the gnocchi too which was delicious and my kids loved the chicken Parmesan.  And to top it off we had the chocolate mousse cake, tiramisu, and spumoni (sp?) all amazing and wonderful choices. We'll definitely be back for more pig out for sure! We live 20+ miles from here but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"I know I have already written a review on PAM but......I received a compliment on said review from someone a few days ago which made me realize I had broken my own rule for trying new places. I will always try a new place twice. You never know, you may have hit them on an off night so its best to give them at least one more shot. Well, all I can say is, who ever sent me that compliment thank you and I love you!!! 
Due to the compliment I started to think about giving PAM one more shot and THANK GOD i DID!!! I ordered a pizza with sausage and some shrimp pasta to go. The gentleman behind the counter was not only very nice and helpful but also very entertaining. He had a strong Italian accent and filled myself and the customer before me in with how NOT to order a cheese pizza. \"Cheese is a family not just one topping\" he says with passion. This was after the man in front of me ordered \"JUST\" a cheese pizza. Shame on him!! LOL! I sat in the very nice little restaurant watching a DVD of wonderful shots of Italy while I waited for my food to arrive. After about 15 minutes i was told it was ready so I took it out to my car and headed home. I could not wait to try something so I reached into the tin where the soft warm bread was and took a bite. Ok, something is different, there is none of the \"tap water\" taste I tasted before. This bread was very good. I got home and my mother and I dug into the pizza and pasta. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Every single bite was fantastic. My mother doesn't really rave about food, the only way I can tell if she really likes it is she tends to inhale it in a matter of seconds. Well, she finished her dinner in record time. I could not believe how fantastic this was. So much different from how it was the first time. I rescind my last opinion and will be back tonight for another wonderful meal. I recommend PAM to everyone and thanks again to whoever reminded me that everyone deserves a second chance.
      
    Thanks, C.K."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food and the service was also great! In my mind that is the determining factor on why I give it a five star rating. I must admit my boyfriend had to literally drag me there because I was unsure about trying out a restaurant located right next to a convenience store...so don't let the location deter you! We ordered mussels for an appetizer, and had the gnocchi (homemade) and the linguine carbonara for entrees. They also serve complimentary bread and dip; I call it Italian chips and salsa. The description doesn't do it justice though; it was really fantastic and the two of us ate the entire serving. The mussels were cooked perfectly; the entrees were wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try the pizza!"}
{"text":"pizza was the bomb had that big 39'' long bad boy 1/2 pep 1/2 mush&sausage we will be back highly recommend trying great crust fire bake awesomeness"}
{"text":"Very cute and intimate restaurant. Food was delicious and authentic. More people need to try this place out and help this mom and pop place grow."}
{"text":"first of all, thank you yelp!! i never would have known this restaurant existed had i not seen all the positive reviews. i've been here a few times and i always order the vegetarian pizza with a side salad. i will say it's not the best for reheating, but take a few friends along, split the pizza and enjoy!"}
{"text":"There are two places in the valley that you should definitely write home to mom about when it comes to wood fire oven pizza. 

This is the other one. 
This is the one however that you can get into pretty much whenever you want. 
This is the one that you know has better pizza than 99.9% of the rest of them.  
I would come here if I didn't have all night to get some really first class pizza.
I would bring someone here to give them the experience anytime.

Located in what most would consider the fringe of the ghetto... It certainly is a bit out of the way. This small pizza place has limited parking and seating for maybe 20 people max in the entire place. What it lacks in space in certainly makes up for in taste. It's BYOB too if you are into that type of thing... (There is a liquor store with a bad selection next to it... but I certainly would recommend stopping somewhere else).

You need to stop in and have one of there BIG pizzas, for me it set a new standard somewhere in my brain. All the quality of something authentically Italian sans all the hype. Prices are reasonable. Owner/staff world class... Tiny... but I have gotten have there a tad early no problem just sitting down... 

Their crust seems a bit mushy I will admit so a fork maybe in order. All and all one of the best places for Italian and pizza hands down."}
{"text":"We have our new slice of Heaven!!!

They also deliver to our house which is even better.

After reading reviews on yelp the wife and I decided to check it out. Great little place very friendly people. We were escaping our inferno of an apartment, the ac was not performing up to our igloo like standards. So, we put a bunch of ice in the dogs water bowls and went off on our new yelp adventure.

Pizza A Metro was a great choice. They gave us tons of water to calm our sweltering hearts and served us amazing food.

To start a pizza crust cut up served with a cold onion bruschetta (the best i can describe) it was very good, but I could not eat a lot of it, however the wife loved it.

Salad: next we shared their least expensive salad, nice leafy spring mix with onions,  tomato's, and a tangy italian dressing (i would order it on the side in the future) Very good and was more then enough for both of us.

Entree: She had a Margherita pizza which she added olives to. She ordered the small and it will last her two lunches in leftovers. I was a bit surprised to see the olives cost an extra $1.50 but other than that she loved it, and I enjoyed it as well.
I had the home made Gnocchi, which were very good, and very filling. It comes with your choice of sauce, I ordered the four cheese sauce (how could you not) it was excellent, but if I had to do it again I would get a red sauce with it.

Please go there support them they are worth it. We have been searching for a pizza place in the downtown area, and I believe this is the champion!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here pretty late - - like 30 minutes before they closed but the owner was nice and let us sit in. 

I ordered the cheese ravioli with alfredo sauce....a little salty and there were only 7 pieces of med-sized ravioli....which I thought was a little pricey ($13.95) but it tasted pretty good. My boyfriend ordered their small Margherita Tomato and Mozzarella pizza ($8.95)...very thin and crispy and pretty decent size for a small and a pretty good deal.

The restaurant is relatively small....has about 2 tables that fits about 5 people and 2-3 small tables for 2 people. Most people I think usually order out at this place. It is supposedly located in a shady neighborhood (according to the owner) but we got out fine haha...=X The restaurant itself is located in a small plaza at the very corner...so it's possible to miss it when driving at night but they do have a med-sized arrow sign that says Pizza in neon florescence light as you enter the driveway. 

The owner was the only server...he was very nice and talkative ... learned a little about Arizona from him...since he lived there for 6 years...hehe I guess he was kinda bored too since there was no one else but us. 

Overall I was pretty satisfied so I would come back to place when I'm in Arizona again hehe"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying this place and I am sure glad I did! 

I ordered a 16 inch Supreme pizza with a side of ranch. While this place is super tiny and trying to get to it off of Thomas is a little bit of a nightmare, don't let these aspects deter you from giving this family owned restaurant a try. 

Right when you pull up, you can smell the delightful aroma of homemade pizza. When I walked in I was greeted right away and when I told them it was my first time trying their pizza, they seemed super excited. There were a couple of laughs exchanged which always provides a positive customer experience.

The taste of the pizza was delicious and the price is spot on. In fact, for the quality they probably under charge. As you will see in my photo, there were an abundance of toppings. The ranch is made in house which always makes me super happy, because... I am a ranch snob. While the ranch was a little runny, still good and I will not hold this against them. Especially since I make my own ranch and know that every batch is a skosh different.

Check this place out and support a local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and place was understaffed for a large group even though place was empty. Pizza quality is only reason for two stars. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I reserve the word \"swell\" for truly important matters. This is a \"swell\" dining establishment.

After a terrible day at work, I decided to try a take-out pizza from this location given its positive reviews on Yelp. I made a good choice indeed. Upon entering, the friendly and charming owner immediately treated me like family (and I was only picking up a medium pizza to go!)

The intimate and charming atmosphere inside is in striking contrast to the archetypal Phoenix \"crudscape\" outside. I definitely plan on returning to \"dine in\" and enjoy some of the restaurant's pasta specialties."}
{"text":"What a great place to have pizza and pasta. 
You will get surprised by the size of the restaurant. 
However, you will get more surprised by the taste of their pizza. 

but,, as a date place? well.. I am not sure about that.
when you don't care about the \"intimate\" mood.. 
Or if s/he is a gourmet, the taste of food will provide the \"intimacy\" that you want. lol"}
{"text":"Okay, I have passed this place in the past, no more!!! Capricciosa pizza, all I can say, yummy, yummy, yummy. The side salad was good, the service great. Had the complimentary crust appetizer for dessert (LOL)... Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place in gilbert. Amazing pizza. Servers awesome.

Also a great place to eat outside."}
{"text":"I love this place. Yes it's tiny, and yes it's in a crappy strip mall and yes it's a tad pricey, BUT it is some of the best authentic true Italian style Neapolitan pizza and pasta in Phoenix. They make everything from scratch, including the mozzarella, from very fresh, high end ingredients. If you know real italian food, you can really tell the difference. I have spoken to the owner and staff many times, and they know they are a little pricey, but they want to maintain the high quality standards. And it's not like they are expensive by any means. I have no problem paying a couple extra dollars for great quality.

Someone compared this place to Pinos. Pinos has great NY style pizza, not Italian style Neapolitan, so you cant compare them because they are very different styles. That makes it clear that the reviewer didn't have a clue what they were talking about. I prefer Neapolitan, so I prefer Pizza A Metro to Pinos. The ingredients are much fresher and higher quality. Plus the staff at PIno's tend to be rather rude and they nickle and dime you over everything, so I only go there if I am in the mood for NY style, which they do well.

The pizza is excellent and authentic, as is the pasta. The pollo parmesan is fantastic. The sauce is true Italian style and very fresh. They serve fresh bread made from pizza crust with all pasta. I usually ask for marinara sauce instead of the olive/onion mixture and mix it with some olive oil. A previous reviewer says they stopped serving it, but that's definitely not correct. They only serve it with pasta, not pizza, so that may be the confusion.

My favorites are the Pizza with meatballs, the pollo parmesan and the capricciosa pizza. And the Vodke Penne is just amazing. The cannoli are delicious, if a bit over priced.

Pizza A Metro is truly a gem in Phoenix - an authentic Italian restaurant like you might find in an Italian neighborhood in a larger city. The food is excellent, authentic and fresh. The staff is friendly.  I go there a few times a month and have never had a bad experience. Check it out."}
{"text":"Great light pizza.   Visited it on a business trip in Phoenix az.  From WA originally.  Nice parlor in downtown."}
{"text":"I should be writing my graduation paper right now but instead I feel like I have an obligation to spread the word on the awesomeness of this place. GPA be damned.

I am gonna be honest and admit that my experiences with ethnic cuisine in Phoenix has not been the best. That said there are a number of good Italian joints in the greater 480 and this is probably the best one. 

By this time I have had an opportunity to try a number of the items on the menu and without doubt the best thing on it is the Margherita Pizza. As Anthony Bourdain has mentioned numerous times on his show good Italian Cuisine is all about effective use of simple ingredients and what better illustration of this then the Margherita. It is a thin crust pizza with marinara, mozzarella, and if memory serves me basil. That's it. But it is effectively put together. You can taste the freshness and quality of the ingredients as they slowly envelop your taste buds in deliciousness. In addition since it is thin crust its not as heavy as your typical pizza meal.    

This is also the first delivery place I have seen that actually serves gnocchi. They get 10 extra points for just having the balls to do that. Of course their gnocchi and the other pasta dishes of theirs that I tried are not of the same caliber as the pizza. So personally I would just stick to the pizza. 

On a final note this place has probably the coolest most down to earth owner I have ever met. He normally makes the deliveries too which is a plus."}
{"text":"The restaurant was completely empty on a Monday night, but the pizza was delicious and the service was excellent.  The wood fired oven is ideal for cooking pizza and produces a taste that typical pizza ovens at most Phoenix metro restaurants simply can't replicate.  The price was very low as well.  $14.50 for a large pepperoni is a great value.  I'd venture to say Sal's and Casanova Bros make more than $14.50 in profit per pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. 

The salads are pretty average, and so was the gnocchi, but they call it \"Pizza a Metro\" because they're known for their pizza...and the pizza is delicious. 

I'd go with the vegetarian, I thought it was a lot better than the margarita, which was also pretty good. 

Did I mention the people were really cool? They are, and that's important. Plus the bread they give you at the beginning of the meal is awesome.

Let's face the real facts here: You can come to a Metro with some friends and get a really good downtown meal for under $10 a person. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hilton double tree in Gilbert and was looking for a place for me and my fiance to have a romantic evening. We came across this place and decided to check it out.  It was amazing. The food came out at a very reasonable time and the presentation was beautiful.  Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants I've dined in.  I highly recommend the shrimp ravioli in the Brandy lobster sauce. The ambience was great the music was soothing and the customer service was beyond expectation.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A definite gem. 

We split an order of veal cannelloni in pink (vodka?) sauce, which were beautifully flavorful and surprisingly light. We also shared a medium pizza - the name escapes me but it was tomato sauce, mozz, some nice sausage with a kick and... broccoli. I can't recall ever having that on a pizza - but it worked. In fact I'd imagine most things cooked in a wood fired oven on a great crust works pretty well. Coupled with the delish bread/caponata dish, we ate very well. And there are a few slices left over in the fridge. 

I know some people aren't fans of the location, size, etc. but some of my fave places in other cities are in the most unexpected areas, strip malls, etc. and you have to give the owner props for taking a chance on a spot that would defy any advice from pricey consultants and created a small, but great chow experience."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem.  I have came here before for dinner with friends but today I decided to try this place for lunch since I was at a work meeting close by.  I ordered the Pollo Caprice today and I was told it would be ready in 25 min.  I got there on time and they greated me nicely and told me my order was ready.  My salad and hot food were packaged separately without having to ask.  Great service and great food.  Thanks Gabriel"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time over the holiday weekend. Overcharged for my take-out order (Spaghetti Bolognese) which tasted like something from the frozen food aisle at SAFEWAY. Rude young woman working the counter. Barely spoke and certainly never thanked me for coming. After realizing she overcharged me when I got home, and then attempting to eat the slop they sold me, I definitely will never be back. I don't know whose writing these great YELP reviews, but my money says it's paid family members of the owner. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once with my mom for lunch. They had just opened for the day so the place was pretty empty. This restaurant is totally family owned and ran. We were greeted by the cutest little boy opening the door for us, another young man sat us at our table and brought us water and bread for the table. Our server was a young woman who seemed a little shy when it came to serving and unfamiliar with the wines. Although the service was a little slow at first, we didn't mind. We ordered the wood fired frescolina pizza, which was amazing! We loved it."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Was in town for the weekend and looked up pizza, this place popped up, decided to try it out. And man was it good."}
{"text":"Came here last night to get a pizza to go. Since it was Ash Wednesday no meat.   We got a Medium size pizza, The Siciliana with Basil, It was as always fantastic!!   THe Pizza here is so good and the restuarant smells so good as well.  We also got Salad. This Place never disappoints. We love it. You will find it nesteled in a little shopping center. Look for the Circle K.  They even have a wood burning fire Pizza Oven. Again we love it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place minutes from my home.  Right in my neighborhood, comfortable atmosphere.  Loved sitting on the patio, which is dog friendly :) Nice music/ambiance.  Our waiter was so friendly and really seemed to enjoy what he was doing.  Ordered bread which were perfect bite size pieces with an incredible dipping butter garlic sauce.  I ordered half cheese, half barbecue chicken pizza and spinach salad.  Both were outstanding!  The chocolate mouse cake was really good.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is my regular pizza take-out place and I love that this tiny little eatery pumps out some pretty great pies!  We order pretty much the same thing each time we go... Vegetarian pizza (loaded with veggies) and a saporita.  I am not a fan of the calamari but am very much a fan of the tiramisu which is DELICOUS.  Gabriel, who I am assuming is the owner, is always friendly and gets us in and out quickly.  This is a consistently good go-to place for pizza."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We are out-of-towners who dropped in for lunch based on all the positive reviews and are so glad we did. Had the prosciutto pizza, spaghetti, and a mixed greens salad - everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Welcome to perhaps the teeniest tiniest sit down pizzeria you can find.  Seriously, picture a pizzeria half the size of your local Domino's trying to cram in seating for 20 (including an outside patio) and you get an idea of just how small this place is.  And yet, it works (for the most part).  I was in the mood for a pizza on a Friday after work.  And although Downtown Phoenix has a barrage of great pizzerias to choose from, Pizza A Metro has been on my radar of late largely because of the great Yelp reviews.  So, tonight was the night to find out what the buzz is about.

Pizza A Metro's main location sits right next door to a Circle K on the northeast corner of 24th Ave and Thomas (just a stone's throw from the I-17).  And yes, the surrounding neighborhood could be classified as somewhat iffy.  Though to be fair the immediate vicinity of the restaurant is quite nice and tucked away (that is if you can get one of the few parking spots available).  Anticipating a big dinner rush, I decided to call ahead and order a pizza to go.  However when I arrived around 5pm, there were only 2 sit down customers there so file that in your memory banks.  Also, a quick note that afternoon rush hour along Thomas Road is horrific so give yourself a few extra minutes if you're coming here around then.  The interior of the pizzeria is quaint, but quite nice.  The television on the wall is a little out of place if you ask me, but the furniture, the decor, and the open view of the pizza prep area create a pretty intimate feel to the place.  For today though, it was grab and go.

They had my pizza ready in about 15 minutes from the time I called.  For my first go around I wanted to do an apples to apples comparison with other pizzerias I've been to in the area.  Among the best I've been to in Downtown Phoenix (and refer to as the \"Big 4\") are Pomo, Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, and La Piazza PHX.  All have a simple margherita pizza, so a simple 12\" margherita it was.  Total cost, $10.  A few bucks cheaper than the other \"Big 4\" margheritas.  Right off the bat, I noticed the crust is thinner than the aforementioned Downtown pizza giants.  The house made cheese is terrific and the basil was a nice subtle addition.  The crust was super crunchy (far crunchier than other pizzerias in the area), though it didn't have the soft chewy texture I like from the \"Big 4\".  The sauce was also a disappointment as there was barely any on the pie that I could taste other than the outer edges.  All in all, a respectable pizza, but by no means did it blow me away.

Perhaps the aforementioned big four Downtown pizzerias were an unfair comparison, because I would probably put Pizza A Metro's version of the margherita behind all of them.  That said, I'd certainly come back for a sit down experience here and the pasta menu seems pretty intriguing.  And for those of you in the east valley, Pizza A Metro also has a location on Greenfield and Warner.  For the rest of you looking to come to the original, don't let the address scare you off.  As neighborhood pizzerias go, this place can hold its own pretty well.  But for me, the \"Big 4\" in Downtown are the still the pinnacle of pizza royalty."}
{"text":"Sometimes you arrive at a restaurant, see the place, and feel like you should probably go try someplace else.  And if you go in, you figure there's probably a 50% chance your car turns up missing after your meal.  Pizza A Metro is one of those places, but it's good enough that you should go ahead and risk it anyways.

Set in one of the most unassuming strip malls they could have found east of the I-17, Pizza A Metro is a humble place that serves up some of the best pies in Phoenix.

I have had the capricciosa and whatever the pie with prosciutto is called (this place is so awesome that I can't even find their menu on the internet).  Both pies were pretty good, topping wise, although I would have preferred that they use fancier olives on the capricciosa instead of canned.

The crust was excellent.  One of the best I've had.  The sauce was right on as well.

Perhaps my favorite part is the bruschetta flatbread appetizer they give you while you're waiting.  It is delicious, and a nice touch.

This is definitely a rotation place for me."}
{"text":"So far the complimentary appetizer is amazing. We had the linguine carbonara and I the shrimp romantica. And a small Hawaiian pizza. All fabulous we will definitely be coming back. Even though we are from Surprise AZ. . The service very friendly and courteous. Good job.."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular (16\") pizza with Pepperoni and white onions. It was very tasty. This is some decent pizza!  it's better than your average Costco pizza. I will definitely be ordering from here again. Small = 12 \", Reg = 16',  Metro = 39 \"."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in an old shopping strip by the Circle K, kinda sketch,but don't skip this place because of that! Great food and great service. The wedding soup and  lasagna were both excellent and making the trip for."}
{"text":"Food was good service was horrible. Forgot salad, beer Tap wasn't working. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Old fashioned pizza shop with charm. Great friendly service. Got a regular pizza it was huge like a Pizza Hut large."}
{"text":"This place is such a great find and so close to my house I can take side streets all the way home:).  I love that it is BYOB... Michael and I brought a bottle of wine with us and proceeded to have one the of the best dinners I have had in a long time.  We started out with the Calamari Friti which was so tasty!  I cannot bring myself to eat the little octopi but Michael has no issues with that and gobbled those little guys up:).  I stick to the fried little rings and I am fine.  Then we shared the meatball pizza... I was kind of hesitant because I thought it might be whole meatballs on a pizza but it was not and I am still dreaming of this pizza the flavors and the crust were amazing.  I cannot wait to come back and try the pasta dishes and the calzones.  We ended our dinner with the Tira Misu... I think the moment our waitress set the desert down it was gone in 5 minutes.  This was such a great dinner and the price cannot be beat... including the $5.00 corking fee the bill totaled $35.00.  Not Bad!!"}
{"text":"I live in the subdivision adjacent to this Plaza and have seen two other restaurants in that same space come and go in a short period of time.  Pizza A Metro will be the third...if they don't improve on their service.  Their wait staff doesn't have any PR skills.  I give their food a B- and their service a D."}
{"text":"Excellent service and their food is AMAZING! So many excellent choices...I've been here a few times and I've had pizzas, pastas, salads, and fish. Every single thing I've ordered has been great. They make this Italian Margarita that is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fire grilled pizza is the only way to go. Service is amazing. Joey was very knowledgeable and gave us some great suggestions.  You gotta try."}
{"text":"For some reason I keep coming back for more and more. I've returned at least 3 times since originally yelping about PaM. That's probably because even after the few snafu's I've had here, the pizza is really good. Probably my favorite take-out pizza. The calzone issue was resolved; it was simply a misprint on their menu. 3 out of 5 for now, though very close to being a 4."}
{"text":"We hada wonderfully experience at pizza A Mateo. The food was very good, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was more upscale and warm than what we experienced in the past."}
{"text":"I wrote once before about Pizza a Metro.  I went home and days later was still dreaming about the wonderful Carbonara dish.  Could it be just a lucky day or can such goodness permanently reside there?  
Now my wife is not overly fond of Italian food.  We went there yesterday and I promised myself a broken promise:  I would order a dish other than linguinni carbonara.  I had it again and once more the heavens opened and the angels sang.
My wife who, did I mention, doesn't care much for Italian food ordered a calzone.  It was stuffed with cheese, mushrooms, ham and she was smitten.  There was a lot of everything in it.
We both ate past the point of not being hungry any more but were compelled to keep eating just because it was so good.
While we were deeply indulging in our own culunary heaven, we saw several dishes come out of the kitchen that looked absolutly heavenly.
One was a plate of Calamari and the other was a salad of chopped tomatos with cheese.
In my previous review, I mentioned that they only had flavored tea.  That has been corrected and they now have regular tea as well.  If it's not offered, just ask for it.  You'll find Victor (owner) and his staff more than anxious to please.
Speaking of staff, as before, the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I always give local restaurants chance. Where do I start. Not the friendliest when u walk in, I ask our host a simple question about thier 39inch pizza she did not even answer me. 2nd, took over 15 min for our server to come even greet us and she comes over she asked what we wanted for dinner not drinks or anything, 3rd this simple pizza took over 30min to bring out and we also order the hamburger which took another 20 min plus   to bring out, the burger came out when we were done eating pizza.  One pizza was cold and did not have all the toppings on it and 2nd pizza was hot which means they did not fire up the pizza's to gather as they should of.. Overall this place we will not return to. Nothing special about this small unprofessional establishment."}
{"text":"I love this little mom and pop run place. their pizza is oven roasted and delicious. The pasta is very authentic and fantastic as well. If you are not looking for it, you would easily pass it by. I recommend this place to everyone! For work, this is where we go for the really big pizza that feeds everyone. Everything on the menu is mouth watering and I recommend trying everything on it!"}
{"text":"The meatball pizza could be worst pizza I've ever tasted. Crust was thinner than paper, but so little sauce or cheese that it was floppy but not too soggy. Also ordered a garden salad that consisted of a bag of spring greens, half an unripe tomato and a few slivers of onion. Went there based on other reviews, but can't understand the love. Not an Italian in the kitchen, either."}
{"text":"We ate here this past Saturday night. Because I read that it was small, I did call for a reservation and they wrote me down. Which was nice, as it was steadily busy..so we did not have to wait long for a table since we called. I had my 7 year old daughter with..she loved the calamari and the bread lasted all of 1 minute. She also devoured my ceasar salad and the penne ala vodka...and she is a noodle/butter/garlic gal...so it was so nice to see her eat so much. Although I went home hungry! It's nice and loud which makes taking kids there perfect..not that you can get crazy..but it's not too have to hush them all the time. Other diners were super friendly and every one spoke with everyone else on there. The owner...yummy! His accent and friendliness...oh ya! BYOB...but so worth taking your own wine to go with the good food. Lights could be a touch more dim..I usually stick with the same thing where ever I go..but I will be going here weekly till I try it all..then decide my fave!"}
{"text":"We have driven past Pizza a Metro many a time and finally decided to try it out around noon on a Monday. The fact that we were the only customers in the restaurant should have clued us in.  I ordered an iced tea and was surprised that I was brought green tea. Not that I have anything against green tea, but not what I  was expecting and felt the waitress should have disclaimed that green tea was the only option available when ordering. Our order was a simple sausage and pepperoni pizza. After waiting a bit, the waitress came back informing us that they had no pepperoni and asked if we wanted a different meat.  I must admit, this was the first time I've eaten at a pizza joint that had no pepperoni. Our sausage only pizza was average, lacking on the sauce. We definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I got a small Margherita pizza and a side mixed green salad. It was amazing! Great dressing on the salad and the pizza was perfect too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Another lesson of not judging a book by its cover.  This place is very small, only 2- 4 tops & about 3 - 2 tops. We stopped in around 5pm & there was another couple in there, they could tell it was our first time so they were raving about all their favorite items.  Our server came by & started us out with water & some bread.  Their prices were really affordable, the server explained that the smallest size of pizza can actually feed 2 people ($8!) we decided to split a Margherita pizza so we could save room for their Tiramisu.  Our server & the couple dining in told us that everything is made from scratch.  Our pizza came out & it was fabulous! So flavorful & had the perfect amount of crunch & doughy goodness in each bite.  Tiramisu was so fresh & delicious.  Our total came out to $15! We can't wait to come back & try some of their pasta dishes soon. Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading us here!!"}
{"text":"Well I had a entertainment coupon book.  I went to use my coupon at the end of dinner.  The waitress informed us that they are not honoring their own coupon.  But next time you come just inform them of the coupon.  Why would I come in next time!  This restaurant must be really hurting for money.  I must remind owner of this business that you paid for advertising to bring in a customer to use your coupon.  Then tell your customer that you are not honoring your own coupon.  Bad business practice! By your own actions you now have a bad review on yelp."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!
When we moved into the downtown area... we ordered a pizza from here to be delivered on moving day. 
It was so delicious, I almost inhaled it! 
The crust could have been a little bit crunchier (seemed a tad bit soggy from sitting in the box.) -- but, still NOT BAD. 
The sauce was delish... the cheese tasted fresh... and the basil on top added the perfect flavor! 
It was more pricey than a typical pizza chain... but, definitely worth it for the taste.
I'd like to visit the actual restaurant sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I would love to offer a positive review for a grass roots local joint, but my third and final trip to this restaurant cements my initial impression - mediocre at best and not worthy of another visit.  Not sure what other reviews were about - I would love a more Italian, authentic product like they seem to be attempting to provide - wood fire oven is definitely a step in the right direction.  But the only good thing I've ordered here was the Pizza Margherita - tough to screw that up - pretty much a glorified Italian cheese crisp...Last go round my pizza was piled with no less than an inch of arugala - most of which was wilted and looked gross - covered with a thin layer of fresh arugala.  Asked the waitress about it and her response?  It works.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience when it comes to service.  I am all about trying local businesses but you need to make an attempt to differentiate yourself.  Food is not the best or the worst; just average. But when it comes to service, this was one of the worst experiences.  We sat down and had no one come to our table for twenty minutes! We called the waiter and she obviously looked bothered and annoyed to come to our table.  Usually I will leave the place at that moment but decided to give them a chance.  Drinks took another ten minutes and food another twenty.  During all that time we sat with empty drinks and our waiter nowhere to be found.  Food finally came out and definitely not worth waiting; as I said before, it was just average and overpriced.  We asked for our soft drinks to be refilled and our waiter never came back except to drop off the bill!

Word of advise! You don't have good food! If you want to make customers, train your people, and at least make an attempt to care so people decide to come back.  Very disappointed and it's a shame."}
{"text":"It's true, the pizza is where it's at. I can only comment on the margharita and the siciliana (eggplant) and they are just really damn good. The sauce tastes like my dad's and the crust is perfectly chewy and yeasty. The mozzarella is there, but it is perfect and not rubbery, greasy or overpowering. They seem to know what they're doing with the seafood specials too. 

We've done BYOW(ine), but recently they offer a couple selections now. You can still bring your own though! I miss the owner though with the Italian persona that would fill up the restaurant.  He seems to have been replaced by the bald awkward one that was usually serving in the past but is now the manager. That's ok. He's a good guy. The owner is still in the picture but seems to be on to bigger and Scottsdalier things at the new location. I will keep coming to this little spot, probably with my parents (parents LOVE this place) and try the home-made pasta next time."}
{"text":"Service-5 stars, very friendly family-like vibe 

Ambiance-beautiful patio, we sat inside though. GREAT music selection the night we were here. 

Calamari-tasty, but a little too heavily breaded for my liking. Red sauce 5 stars.
Entrees-all were well balanced and delicious. 

Desert/Coffee-this is where it went south. First, they didn't have decaf. Not the end of the world. What was odd to us was there was no cream. Just milk. \"We don't have cream.\" Really? How do you make ANY cream sauce here? The tiramisu and canolli were DRENCHED (obscenely so) in some bottled chocolate sauce. I like tiramisu because it's a desert with minimal chocolate. It was inedible. Such a bummer. Ask for the chocolate sauce on the side, trust me. 

Last note...there was a cute little kid at the door (must be part of the family) that was opening it for patrons. Cutest little dude ever."}
{"text":"I have never had such terrible service in my life. We sat ourselves outside and waited 10 minutes before anyone came over. When they finally did, the waiter brought menus. Another ten minutes we got water and ordered food. 45 minutes later our appetizer came out, another 15 minutes my fish came out, no large cheese pizza , after one hour we told the waiter to give us our bill , minute the pizza we were leaving."}
{"text":"This was awesome pizza, bread, and service!!  We picked this place from Yelp and was not disappointed!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"It's not even close.  Best pizza in Phoenix.  I work close by and pick up pizza often.  Every time I introduce someone to this place, their hooked.   Stay away.  I don't want this place to get too popular."}
{"text":"I took my daughters out for lunch and it was evident immediately that the waitress was either new or not very good. She said we could sit anywhere and she'd bring the menus later. We chose a back booth so we could be silly and loud and not bother anyone. We got menus (mine was blank) we ordered escargot for the table to start and it arrived broiled on top and made it crusty and rubbery. When delivered we had no plates, but they arrived a little later. Our entrees arrived and they were pretty good. Since it was one of my daughter's birthday we all ordered Creme Brulee and it was AWFUL! It had been made a few days before and the sugar had been torched already and put in a fridge. It was eggy, stiff and rubbery as well. I had ordered a pizza to go before I realized the food was mediocre. It was a short rib pizza and the meat is gray and dry. I'm not sure my husband will even eat it. The waitress had a hard time figuring out the bill and had to get help with it. I spent $112.00 without tip and when I complained about the food the only response was \"oh, sorry\" and that was it. Don't go here."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  I heard about this place on Open Table and then did some research on Yelp and quickly realized I better get my butt over to this amazing place!  I checked it out for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside and there are very few tables inside, but the food speaks for itself!  The staff was all very friendly and willing to please.  The bread and tomatoes were amazing to start and my pasta was just delicious!  The 4.5 star overall review for this place is definitely warranted in my book!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My hubby heard abt this place thru yelp & When I first saw the location, it didn't necessarily have the best curb appeal. However, the decor and intimate size of the dining area makes up for it; especially the food. I've had the pepperoni and the margarita pizza, and we've had the lasagna & shrimp pasta dish. No complaints whatsoever. :) the appetizer, bruschetta is Delish. I guess what I'm implying is that I haven't been disappointed! 
I personally prefer their pizza over pizza bianco."}
{"text":"This cute restaurant feels like home, quiet. When you order your food the staff are quick to respond. This place is a good restaurant to take your loved ones to or that special someone. The staff are down to earth, wish more places where like this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious calzones!  We brought our kids and had a great meal. Attentive fast service. Highly recommend this!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with co-worker for late dinner, and we were not disappointed. Very good food and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I dropped in a while back on National Cheese Pizza Day and wasn't disappointed. I went with their Margherita pizza and they brought out some bread with a bruschetta style dip that was outstanding, all for around $12!! I was very satisfied with the food and the price was an added surprise."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for years when I was going to culinary school down the street.  Everyone raved about the pizza  I  had a small pizza today big enough for two people and some great bread bites great place to have lunch"}
{"text":"In a reasonably late scramble for dinner, this pizza place was quite a find.

The location isn't altogether promising, right next to a Circle K and tucked in an itty bitty end in a strip mall. There are only about 7 table. Yet the owner, whose service was excellent, makes the most of the situation. 

The wife and I split a margherita pizza. Out first, though, is the appetizer, which was small pieces of pita-like flatbread served with balsamic vinegar served over a tomato and celery salsa cruda. Nom. Worth eating in for. 

The pizza itself was a thin crust... The crust was decent, the cheese was good, and both the basil and tomato very fresh. It must be nice having ready access to fresh versions of both year-round!

We were very happy with our meal. Pizza A Metro should be on your short list for a good Italian pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Don't get the negative reviews. Yes, the location in the Circle K strip mall lacks the aesthetics. The place is tiny. But the pizza? Beyond wonderful...hand tossed, brick oven baked, melts in your mouth. The friendly waiter told me they  also have an upscale place in Scottsdale so if that's important to you, go there. I'll keep going to Thomas Rd and enjoying the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Mama Mia! what are you a doing here? 

I was leery to say the least coming to this part of town with my boss for lunch. It is in a small strip mall where the .99 store even found a need for metal bars on the winnow. This is not your typical location for fine dining. 

External appearances inside you are met with a small dining room with nice tables and chairs (no table cloths.) Note seating is limited to 4 four person tables and two 2 person tables. 

The menu us full of Italian food like pastas, not just pizza. 

Due the name of this place I had to try the pizza, I went with a small vegetarian ($10) It had everything on it, including artichoke, eggplant, olives and more.  For a small it is a good size, this with a app or salad would be good for two. Big me only ate half.

Meals include and amazing bruchetta, the flat bread is hot straight from the wood oven, the bruchetta is full of flavor and is fresh.

My bosses spagetti and meatballs (8.95) were artfully presented and, as I could see the kitchen cooked and sauted to order. He enjoyed his meal as well.

If you are looking for some great food in a very unexpected location give this place a try."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the neighborhood of lack of curb appeal, this is a great restaurant!  I was out on a business trip and used Yelp to guide me... I was not disappointed. 

We ordered the small (12\") Margherita & a small Siciliana (cheese & eggplant pizza) they were both amazing. Though friends Siciliana was tastier, you can't go wrong with either one. 

The table next to us ordered pasta dishes and all we kept hearing is \"delicious\"!  They stared at our pizza when it came and remarked on how good it looked... they were right. 

The Italian Wedding soup we ordered as an appetizer was a but bland but not terrible. 

They brought a complimentary appetizer of pita slices & a type if onion relish dip - very yummy!

The tiramisu was also quiet yummy. Overall a good experience - totally worth a visit... or multiple visits."}
{"text":"5 stars everytime. Margherita pizza is hands down the best pizza in the valley. Awesome service and awesome pizza! Try it and you will agree."}
{"text":"What a great place to dine. The food is awesome, the chef rocks!!! The best part was the service everyone was very nice and willing to help. Great prices amazing food."}
{"text":"Wow where  has this place been  and why have I not seen their sign before?

I know everyone has already reviewed and oohed and awwed , which it deserves.  But I  am going to give it a  better rating , it tasted great and my daughter liked it!   Yeah!  My nine year old  enjoyed it and it was good for  her.  Now we have a place to stop for a bite before getting on the freeway."}
{"text":"Delish! I went here for lunch after a coworker recommend it, and I ended up eating myself silly. I had the Penne alla Vodka, which was wonderful (but if you don't like salty sauces, maybe not for you) and the tiramisu was very light and fluffy. The cons are: the inside is tiny, so there only a few tables; parking is also limited; the service was a little slow. Still, though, the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I love the fact that the clientel varies from business professionals to painter/construction workers, obviously with a taste for good Italian.  The Italian Wedding soup was delicious.  With sliced meatballs and a poached egg..... it's a meal in itself.  The complimentary pizza crust with tomatoes in vinegar was a very nice touch. 
For my 2nd dish I ordered the Caprese salad and it was delicious as well. Fresh- plentiful mozzarella on top a bed of greens and tomatoes. Yum!!  So much food I had to take a bag home, oh Shucks!

It's a tiny intimate space with very good service and a great big mural that may be torn down when they expand.  Check them out while their still small!"}
{"text":"This is a great secret gem of an Italian resturant.  Awesome owner snd chief, the bartender / lead waitress (Sally)  takes customer service to another level. The passion they have for the wonderful dishes that the chef prepares is above and beyond expectations.  The environment/atmosphere is delicately modern  and romantic.   Lastly, the hand made deserts are to die for!  Walt"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews I was soooo ready to eat what many people said was one of the best meals ever. Before my food arrived I was given some bread to munch on and it looked really good I took one bite and remembered Patricks review of the dough tasting like tap water. Patrick was right.  The pizza dough tasted the same and I was crushed. Is there something wrong with me and Patrick? Why doesn't everyone else taste what we taste? I will be going back to try out the entrees and I will update my review"}
{"text":"Well, 
This is my next stop searching for that pizza I have been missing since I moved here. Even though food here is good, I am still searching! The most amazing thing about this place is the location. Never knew it could exist at that place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. I work downtown and usually make it here once a week or every other week. I came here and was happy to order chicken Marsala and hear a few minutes latter the chief pounding chicken cutlets, reminded me of home. Fresh and on point, the Alfredo is out of this world and the pizzas are the same. They have a large brick over to cook there pizza and the pizza comes out thin crust as if it was made in a bakers pride oven. Don't let the outside deter you, once inside it is a very modern romantic look with a few tables. Great date spot or place to pick up to go. One last thing, every time I go to Pizza a metro the service is some of the best I've experienced in the food industry."}
{"text":"Il Mio Dio.

According to Babelfish, that's Italian for Oh My God.

According to me, this is the Best Italian. I've had. In the US. Heck, even better than some Italian I've had in Italy. Do you really need me to carry on, especially considering all the reviews listed here? Pizza A Metro has to be doing something right.

That something would include incorporating fresh ingredients (and dough tossed in front of you after you order a pizza or calzone), tasty arrangements (the calzone was magnificient), and very decent prices (lunch for two w/tip was under $30) into a tiny but efficient establishment. 

The only drawback is that my ass probably couldn't expand enough to accommodate the amount of food I want to eat from here. But Mio Dio, I will put it to the test."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Don't be deceived by the outside. This is on the end of a mini mart-Circle K. It is one of those holes in the wall locations, but WOW is not a big enough word to describe it. Went in for the pizza and ended up with a seafood pasta dinner that was delicious. It was served in the pan it was cooked in on really nice plates. We were served an appetizer of bread with chopped tomato & onions in vinegar & oil. We were greeted by the owner himself. It is really small inside, so seating is limited. There were a lot of take outs for pizza, and they have this really long pizza that is one of their specials. Can't wait to go back for the wood burning oven pizza!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for 2yrs and finally decided to give this place a try, we are glad we did. We had margarita and pepperoni pizza, spaghetti, and salads and will be back for more. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We saw all the good reviews and had to try!!!! SO GLAD WE DID! We had: Caesar salad - yum, capprese appetizer - delicious!!!! If you're not starving, two ppl could spilt a small pizza (at least 12\" diameter) our party tried the meat lovers, the meatball, and the margharetta. All were absolutely delicious!!!! Unfortunately there was no room for dessert...
Tiny little place, easy atmosphere, friendly, hard working staff. You need to try it!!!!"}
{"text":"After growing up in Phoenix with summer times spent in NY, it was refreshing that somebody finally brought real Italian to Central Phoenix.  Over the years, Central Phoenix has become a great place for true Italian food.  There are many great places to choose from with particular items, such as Tutti Santi and L'Amore for the home-made Raviolis, Aiello's for the Gnocci, Gieseppe's for the New York style mom and pop dishes, Spinatos, Cibo and Bianco for their Pizza.  The list goes on and on.

Then came Pizza a Metro.  The 1st time I ate there, I felt like I was back in Trevesio, Italy.  You will not find a better and more traditional, tasty meatball pizza anywhere.  All pastas are home-made daily.  The Lasagna is silky smooth and Canneloni is similar.  The sauces are very traditional in flavor and are perfectly seasoned.  Even the Spaghetti and Meatballs is out of this world good.  The and Puttanesca is completely mouth watering.  The Caesar dressing was not at all creamy, like a real Caesar Dressing.  The Calamari is very lightly breaded and not over-cooked, which is the way it's supposed to be.  You simply will not find any better Truly Authentic Italian Food in Phoenix.  In a nut-shell, This place does everything with perfection.

The only downside is the location and the size.  It would be nice if they were in a place that was at least triple the size (more then 6 tables) and had a decent parking area.  The store and video shop that shares the plaza brings in a lot of weirdos.  There is no where to hang out if you are waiting for a table.  So make sure you get there as early as possible or after lunch.  This place would make a killing if it were closer to light-rail.  I wonder how they would move the most insane Pizza oven in Arizona."}
{"text":"The food was yummy! We ordered a caprese  salad, which was super fresh! And a pepperoni mushroom pizza, it was thin and crispy! The service was great, waiter was attentive and the restaurant is super clean and has a great ambiance. We will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"Truely A hidden gem in the city!! Must go to. Small but defiantly worth the wait if you have to. Food is Awesome and staff is great. I moved away from Phx for a year and when I came back to visit, Pizza A Metro is the first place to visit."}
{"text":"This is a place you would not normally stop at as it's hidden away in the corner of a small strip in a less desirable part of Phoenix.......yet the food is out of this world!!  The started the meal off with this amazing bruschetta and the meals we ordered reminded me of a good italian meal from where I used to live in New Jersey.  I am so glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"Just tried their fescolina pizza. Awe yeah... Tasty definitely coming back later, haha"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in phoenix. Incredible food, good service. It's a hit every time!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly delicious. Very friendly and clean atmosphere. The pizza is awesome. Prices are outstanding! Wish they had more locations!!"}
{"text":"I don't care that it isn't in the greatest part of town, or is situated next to a Tiffany or Nordstrom.  What I care about is great food, and this place definitely offers that.  The bonus is the price.  The value was definitely there, and everything was priced at or below what I felt was fair value.

I went with friends, and we shared an appetizer, salad, special, and a meter of pizza.  The grilled calamari was fantastic, and the salad it was on was very flavorful with a house dressing.  The Caprese salad was good, but not great.    The snapper with veggies was the special of the day.  While I am not a fish guy, this was some of the best I have had.  It was served in a tomato broth with veggies.  Cooked perfectly and no fishy taste/smell.  It was served with pasta that had a little heat, and was perfectly balanced (everything was nicely seasoned.  Finally, the meter of pizza.  The cheese and sauce were divine.  The bread was very good, but as other reviewers have said, it was a little limp in the middle, due to it being so big.  The edges were really good, and the toppings (arugala and proscuitto on half of it) were top notch.  

I will definitely be back, even if it is on the west side of Central.  There are many other menu items I want to try, and that will force some return visits."}
{"text":"Jackpot!  Pizza a Metro is that rare joint that gets the basics down right - great food at an excellent value, paired with a charming interior (albeit tiny) and an owner who understands service and customer loyalty. 

My only fear is that the place will change as more Phoenicians get wise to this gem.

Robert O. put it best, you'd have to be a stone cold douche to think that this place isn't [great].  
\"}
{"text":"Great food if you have not been here in a while you should try it again. They are under new management and the service is much better.  Pizzas are hand tossed and wood fired.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Nice place, good Italian menu.  Had the spaghetti and meatballs.  It was OK, but was a little on the bland side for my taste.  Not sure what it was lacking, maybe garlic or basil, but not very flavorful. My wife had the fish tacos and they were in the bland side as well.  May come back and try their pizza sometime."}
{"text":"Came to Gilbert on business and wasn't too impressed with what food they had to offer at the Hilton I was staying, so I ventured out...Just down the road I stumbled across this little gem. It was very unsuspecting at first, being in a nice strip mall location. Once I walked in I was welcomed into a beautiful setting complete with marble, beautifully frescoed walls and ceilings, a nice fully stocked huge bar area & patio, and servers who were ready to serve up some of the best food I've had in a long time! The Egg Plant Parmesan was superb, best I've had before! The desert however, was amazing! You've got to try this place, you won't leave disappointed. I know I'll be back and plan on telling telling any of my coworkers that come to the area that it's a must try."}
{"text":"Curb appeal given the neighborhood and parking -- lots to be desired. (and why the 4 stars only)  But once inside and the appetizers hit the table and food appears -- you will be in heaven and not caring what happens outside at all.  Numerous visits and it all has been incredibly good.  Highly recommended and I an anticipating yet another visit upcoming. =)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - It can be a cozy, romantic evening, but we like to do groups here, because of the warmth. They really take care of you, and are all about family. They do a great job with the Italian staples and always have a couple of unique dishes to offer. Of course, their pizza is the best in Gilbert - hands down. Also, they have a nice selection of beer and wine with top shelf liquor available, so everyone is happy. You have to finish with Sambuca!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! They really went out of their way to accommodate our family - from tired, hungry kids to out of town guests who were missing the taste of authentic Italian food...not the first time we have been here, but this recent trip made it worthy of review. Our waitress was happy to offer suggestions; wine was great and she was attentive to keeping it filled. Food - I had al dente penne with chicken and vodka sauce, and my husband had a seafood plate (we can't remember the name but fabulous) - everyone's food came out quickly and delicious. It's a cozy place that readily attended to us and took care of our crew, and it really couldn't have done any better."}
{"text":"If I didn't have to bring my \"gat\" to dinner I would have given it 5 stars....

Food - 
Had a pizza and the gnocchi. Both were very good. One of the better pizza's I have had in phoenix. Definitely fresh, loved the tomato sauce. Nice crust. Not to thin, not too thick. The gnocchi in vodka red sauce was also really good. They serve this great flat bread....it is awesome. Almost worth going just for the bread.

The Ambience - 
The place is small. Not like in the \"cute, warm and cozy small\" way. It is f*ing small. Sort of hot and stuffy the night we went. Besides the few tables (literally like 5 in the whole place) he has done a good job with the inside, especially in the seedy location.

The location - 
In a ghetto strip mall. We had to wait for a table (in my car) and there were some pretty interesting characters. Where else can you see a dude in a wife beater eating his dinner out of a country crock container while on the move to his next score.

The service - 
Good. But the owner (who is really nice and seems to actually be Italian, or at least watched a lot of Italian movies to get the accent down) is the ONLY server. So it is a bit chaotic. He needs some help. But he does a great job.

Wine - 
You wouldn't know they had wine because there isn't a hint of it on any menu. Maybe they are on the \"DL\" (down low for those less gansta than myself)....anyway, we asked and got a nice large glass of Chianti. Very good actually. Just put that shit on the menu.  Seriously, I love my drinky drink.

Overall, i will go back!  Check it out. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is very tiny, not pretentious, but not junky and the people are friendly. We ordered the very big pizza, not sure what it is called, but it is served on a wood plank. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were good. I have had better pizza before, but I still applaud eating food that actually tastes like real food in restaurants now days.

Several people at other tables were ordering Italian dishes that looked and smelled amazing. I would love to come back and try some of those."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Pizza a Metro last night, and all I can say is WOW.  Dave had the pizza, but I wanted food food, so I ordered the Chicken Picatta.  It was frankly just amazing.  The chicken was a tender as could be, and the flavor was out of this world.  

It's not a huge menu, but they have all the standards, chicken, veal, all the pastas, and some fish.  No alcohol, but the party next to us did bring in their own wine (I never did find out what the corking fee was).  

I really don't love their location... not that it's far, but it's in a teensy little strip mall that consists of a seedy Circle K (the one that has an armed security guard posted outside the door after dark) and a hair salon.   But inside it's really just lovely.  The owner is as Italian and friendly as they come, although please, Signor, I may be a divorcee with a teenager, but still, can't you help a Signora out and call her a Signorina?

Prices are more than reasonable too.... I can get my favorite dishes to go for probably less than it would cost me to prepare them at home.  Yet another place to keep on my list of go-to places, yay!"}
{"text":"I just came home after eating here and I want to go back already. This place gets my nomination for #1 restaurant in the Avenues. 

Make reservations. It's catching on fast."}
{"text":"Although I have eaten here twice and absolutely loved it, I have been afraid to write a review of it because I'm afraid people won't take it seriously. 

Because they shouldn't. I gave a four-star review to Pizza Patron. Because I for one love traditionally awful pizza. The sketchier the better. I like it greasy (like my hair) and cheap (like my thrills). I love it when the pepperoni gets those little pools of oil in them and when there's so much topping that it falls off the pie while you're cutting it and you have to pick it out of the box...you know, I think I'm going to stop here before I lose my Elite Status on principle.

There's a reason you don't see me waiting in line for Pizzeria Bianco. Because I would just embarrass myself by asking the waitier if my Wise Guy could come with a side of ranch or brown sauce (you call it A-1, like that makes it classier...stfu).

The first time Misty and I went to Pizza A Metro, we took my mother. After having just learned that all that underwear in the laundry was actually mine and not my girlfriends, she really needed the cheering up. So we decided to bring her into a sweaty pizzeria and tell her we were engaged.

I say sweaty because at the time the air conditioner was broken. They did have some fans up. A whole lot of good a couple of fans did when we were sitting like five paces away from the fucking oven.

We ordered a metro-size margherita pizza, which really hampered our yelping because we spent THREE DAYS eating the damn thing. But fuck was it delicious. Here I was trying to find the craziest, fattiest meats to stack onto my pizza and all it takes is some basil and tomatoes to sate my taste buds. 

The manager was really nice with a dash of eccentric charm. Which is good, because he spent our WHOLE meal standing over us, striking up small talk and asking us our opinions of the food. 

Yeah man, the food's great. Now if you'll excuse us, I need to call work and tell them I need to take the week off so I can digest your fucking franken-monstrosity of a pizza.

Mom enjoyed it too, I think. With all this life-changing news happening around her, I think I could've said to her \"I just saved money on my car insurance by switching to Geico\" and her eyes would have filled with tears of relief and joy.

The second time we went, we brought my brother, the pickiest, most pretentious eater I have ever known.  This is a guy who defends his refusal to try sushi by saying \"there are some things I just know I won't like. Like [insert homoerotic sex maneuver].\" Yes, I said maneuvers. No go [synonym for \"copulate\"] yourself.

He actually lives down the street from a Pizza Patron and eats it 2x a week. And even HE admitted the pizza was amazing. He didn't care much for the carpaccio, but I did. And this is my review. So whatever.

I personally like the intimate space, claustrophobia aside. I'm tired of these reasonably sized restaurants that cater to normal crowds of people. I want massive kitchens that leave little to no room for diners. The smaller the dining area, the higher the likelihood you get to sit by the window. Sit by the window and watch all those other fools, I dunno, do what fools do, like watch MTV and vote against gay rights, I guess. Yeah, phobe, I can see you trampling my rights. You have just been taken off the list for my next party, jerkface.

I'm so confident in Pizza A Metro's potential for awesomeness that I'm even going to try something not pizza next time. Gasp. Am I going to violate my \"no eating anything not stated in the sign\" policy? Yes. This weekend (or January 18, if this ever gets to be ROTD), when I meet with some other yelper(s) for lunch, I will probably order a pasta dish. And maybe a salad. 

Oh god am I about go through my  \"salads only\" phase? I am NOT looking forward to this."}
{"text":"It was ok... later I had an upset belly... Not sure about my return. Plus the food was a little cold. I just wish the look of the food matched the taste."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for some time to see what was up.. the only thing I can say is that I'm sorry.. so sorry for not coming here sooner. Yes, this place is in the hood and is smaller than a postage stamp but is so good that you can brave the seedy location for one night. 

There are several pasta's on the menu but only a handful are handmade. We had the gnocci in the vodka sauce as well as the cheese ravioli.. come on, these are so good.. like crazy yummy good! The creamy sauce paired well with the perfectly prepared pasta's.. eyes were rolled back into our heads!! 

For our main course we ordered the meatball Metro.. this pizza is HUGE.. check out the pics! for 25 bucks this monster is worth every penny.. sweet chunky tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella and little chunks of meatball.. the crust was a little bit salty in a good way.. the crust could have been enjoyed on its own! 

In the end this place so many wonderful elements.. fast personal service, great pricing and wonderful eats. Its a real winner!! Cant wait to try the new location over on our side of town."}
{"text":"Recently went here for dinner as I've heard many good things about this tiny little place. At a quick glance you would miss this place as it's in a strip of shops (wouldn't really call it a strip mall as there is 4 little places by it with a Circle K at the end). I found some parking because it was early in the evening. Upon walking in I noticed there was a large family eating so there was only about 3 tables inside open. I had some wine and appetizers to tie me over until my dinner date arrived since she was coming from across town. The tomato balsamic mixture they serve with fresh pizza dough is OUTSTANDING! I could eat that stuff every day! The calamari was also very good! I had the small margarita pizza (perfect size to share) and it was GREAT! Then they gave us complimentary dessert! It was the best tiramisu I've ever eaten! The service was amazing and the food was outstanding. I will certainly be back soon.

Don't let the exterior fool you...this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Try this hidden gem. I haven't had the pasta yet but the pizza is amazing and have been told from friends the pasta is the same.

After talking to the owner last month he is suppose to start offering delivery soon."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for delicious food and great atmosphere.

On our second visit, everything was delicious as well.

First visit:
The spinach ravioli was the best ever, literally.

I enjoyed the Italian atmosphere. 

The waitress, April, was charming. 

We're definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Metro before heading back to the airport for my trip back home. The place was empty at about 2 pm. My usual test for how good an Italian restaurant is - I try their chicken parmigiana. I know this place is mainly a pizza place, but if it's on the menu, it better be just as good. I did not try the pizza. The chicken parm was on the lunch menu. It came with a side of penne. It was a good size for the lunch menu and cost $10.95. The cutlet was pounded thin and was very juicy. There was a square of mozzarella which didn't cover the entire cutlet. Maybe more mozzarella would have been better. One thing I need to mention is that the sauce was a bit spicy. I don't think it was mentioned on the menu, and not sure if it's the same sauce they use on the pizza. It was good, but spicy. People should know this in case they order it for their kids. They passed my chicken parm test. 

Service was good. I know I was the only customer there, but the waitress was very attentive. Sometimes when the restaurant isn't busy, the waitstaff is even worse. They get into conversations with co-workers, and you never see them. That was not the case here. 
I took some desert with me to go. Actually flew it back to Los Angeles with me. I bought the Tiramisu and two Canollis.  Wife and kids enjoyed the Canollis. Although my wife didn't understand why they would drizzle chocolate syrup over the canolli. I think they should avoid that step. The tiramisu was also very good. Price was $4.95 each (1 canolli)."}
{"text":"Reviews are definitely personal opinions. Therefore, everyone should try for themselves. This place is amazing!!! It has an excellent customer service. Knowledgeable bartender. Great Italian food. Decor, ambiance, music, patio, full bar... you name it. Don't judge the book by the cover, have your own experience"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new. Asked the waitress to make something with chicken. Chef made a dish called the lemon pepper chicken. It was excellent! This is the kind of place you can do this. Definitely will come here again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! Excellent and authentic Italian food at a good price! Service is awesome and a nice quaint intimate environment. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I often bring people who visit from out of town for the excellent food."}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly! First time here and they took care of us very well. Food is super tasty!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and we had such a pleasant time. The staff was great the food was to die for. Would go back a million more times."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what all the hype is all about.  Sure, they offer fresh and authentic Italian food, but they are also in a ghetto, run-down area and the prices are not competitive for the overall value ($8 for a small sandwich and salad).  The service was surprisingly good, and the bread was superb, but the cons will prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Friendly service and great prices...it's a hidden gem. Definitely recommend the margherita pizza. Have been there numerous times since moving in to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Took my 10 year old here for his birthday. We sat outside because it was such a beautiful March evening. Despite the strip mall environment, the restaurant staff and food were top notch. We will be back."}
{"text":"Small little pizza spot with a decent variety of italian dishes.. great quality food.. only a few tables inside so there is limited seating.. but the quality of the food is delicious...."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Italian done old school.  Their daily lunch specials for $5.00 are filling & they have quite a few selections.

Everything is prepared to order & most ingredients are from Italy.

The chef/owner Alex takes time to chat with the customers & it is evident that he loves cooking.

All of the dishes are delicious, but the Italian tuna sub and the spaghetti are our favorite."}
{"text":"Wow, for such a small hole in the wall, there are a lot of surprises packed in here.  

For starters, don't let the location scare you away.  

Don't let the size scare you away.

We were greeted at the door by the owner who patiently held the door open for us as we slowly made our way in.  There were two tables outside with umbrellas and tablecloths.  Inside there were 4-6 two top tables, and about 3 four tops.  Very tiny.  But it turns out, very intimate.  

Since my son and I went with my parents, we were seated at a four top.  Clean and well presented.  A small TV hung on the wall with the basketball game on (happened to be Celtics!).

Service was quick.  We placed our orders with our friendly and informative waiter and were served a plate of bread (didn't think to ask what kind as I did not recognize it) with a chunky tomato dressing on the side.  Both were excellent.

Since everything is made fresh, the wait for food was a little long, but not bad. 

I ordered the Margarita Pizza, my son order the same with onions on it, my mother ordered the Chicken Parm, my father ordered the Lasagna.  Everyone loved their food.  My parents cleaned their plates.  My son and I had ordered small pizzas which I had assumed were personal sizes.  turns out they were a medium Dominos sized pizza.  So we got yummy leftovers!

While we dinned, the owner approached the table to ask how everything was.  He explained that he was the new owner and was excited to see new faces.  We chatted with him for a while.  He came over several times over the course of the evening and helped get water for our glasses which never went empty.  During our talks my son mentioned that his 11th birthday is on Friday.  The owner later remembered that and told him happy birthday 11 year old!  That was sweet.

We also ordered desert.  My mother ordered the Tiramisu, my father ordered the Creme Brulee, and my son and I split the chocolate cake.  Guess which was the best?  The Creme Brulee!  Sweet and yummy.  The Creme and the cake had a raspberry drizzle on it.  The cake was actually more like a slice of fudge.  The Tiramisu was light and sweet.  All very good.  They also have a Canonli, but we didn't try that.  Oh well.

I really can't find any fault with this place.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere.  I am assuming that the new owner changed the plates.  Everything was served on plain white square or rectangular plates that I like a lot better than the ones in the pictures.  The pasta dishes were served on square plates that were maybe a square foot.  Crazy big!  

It was pricey.  I think the total before tip was somewhere around $80 for the four of us.  My pizza was $9.  I have had better, it wasn't bad though, and the overall experience made up for it.  My parents couldn't help but rave about their food, especially the deserts.

I recommend Pizza A Metro, especially for a date!"}
{"text":"We have been here at least a dozen times. We've dined in, called ahead to pick up, and stop in to have a drink while we wait for our food. The food has always been top notch, and the service friendly. 

Our favorites include the anti pasta salad and the pizza's. They are consistently cooked to perfection. And the flavors are always fresh and consistent. If we're going to order a pizza, we much prefer pizza a metro to other places."}
{"text":"My BFF and I played hookie today to lunch it up. As always the food is out of this world good. In fact, during desert, she actually schooshed me, because she was having a moment with the tiramisu. Normally I wouldn't add this sort of thing to a review, but seriously... she schooshed me! 

PAM will now be open from noon to 8:30 on Sundays. They are staffing up for the opening of their Scottsdale location and the place is all a buzz. Although you can generally get in with little or no wait during lunch, you would be smart to call ahead or make a reservation for dinner. Also their liquor license is in process, but you can still BYO."}
{"text":"Was here for the 2nd time the other night. The food here is awesome! The pizza definitely has more of an authentic Italian feel to it. Got the prosciutto and arugula pizza last time I went. The crust is perfect - it's not super crispy thin - but still light and perfect. Oh, the dessert is pretty awesome too! We ordered a cannoli and tiramisu. Whatever the stuff that's stuffed in the cannoli tastes like chocolate chip cookie dough without being overwhelming.

The service wasn't the greatest which is why I'm only giving it 4. I think it was the owner who took care of us, and maybe cuz it was the end of the day or something - but he didn't seem to be in the greatest of moods and wasn't all to welcoming or friendly. We didn't let it get to us.

This place is definitely tucked away in a random tiny strip mall on Thomas. You miss it if you blink. But definitely worth the stop to check out."}
{"text":"We took mom there for her b-day tonight. Just a chill evening with good food, nothing pretentious, nothing outlandish, nothing crowded, nothing chain. 

We loved it. She choose Margarita pizza, Cheese ravioli, Cesar salad. 

The bread they serve before the meal was amazing.
The salad was cold and crisp with a perfect amount of dressing. 
The Ravioli was the best I have ever had. 
We even had a surprise Penne Pasta with artichoke and marinara arrive at the table. It was a typo when entering the order. It was really good too. 

Then for dessert they brought out Creme Brule with a candle!

Thanks for the great evening tonight, we loved the food and appreciated the service."}
{"text":"Used to go to this same location several years ago - was great then.  Today I called in for a Sausage, Mushroom, Pepperoni, medium size.  It was $22 out the door.  Thought that was a little high but it was highly recommended.  It was not a bad pizza, but I've had a lot of ones that were better for a lot less cash.  Ingredients seemed fresh but the cheese was real sparse, also it was on the verge of being burnt.  This was an order done at 4:00 in the afternoon, no one else in the place.  I expected much more!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible take out! We tried this place for the first time tonight, excited to try to find a good local spot for some thin crust pizza. We live less than two miles from here and by the time it got home, the food was crap. 

Both pizzas were soggy and cold, we had to heat them in the toaster oven to make them even edible. The pizza itself does taste okay, but does not give you that delicious flavor and crisp you would imagine it should. The worst part was the fried zucchini! They are very thin, long, and not enough batter (which did taste like a  good batter). Once again we had to recook our food that we just had got since every piece was so soggy and gross. Majorly disappointed as they did taste good, but were not even remotely firm or crispy. Even the cannoli was a bit of a let down. While the filling is very delicious, the pastry itself is very hard, crunchy, and only had cream on the ends.. maybe it is old? I love cannolis but have never had one this hard! 

Sadly this did not live up to the hype we heard. Things sounded so mouth watering, and the company's photos surely drove us to order, but in all honesty nearly any major chain franchise can make a better thin crust and I have made better frozen pizza and zucchini in my own oven. Guess we will have to keep on searching for a good local thin crust!"}
{"text":"Worst managed restaurant we've ever experienced. I was a little uncomfortable with the very unhappy young boy (10 years old at the most) who was handing out roses to the moms for Mother's Day and then later gathering wood in a big trash barrel while the Manager was sitting at the bar and then later outside on his cell phone for long stretches of time. The restaurant was busy and there was 1 poor waitress doing an amazing job holding it all together while her boss avoided the restaurant and customers at all costs. Regardless of the 1.5 hour wait time for food the Manager never made the rounds to the tables or did anything to assist the only waitress there. When we complained about the 1.5 hour wait both the Manager and cook came to our table with excuses and offered us a very generous free dessert!! Are you kidding me?! We had been there with toddlers for an hour and a half and they thought we would be interested in keeping our boys up even further past their bad time for a free dessert? As we were leaving, we saw the Manger on his phone at the end of the sidewalk out front. We stopped and expressed our disappointment again. The Manager told us that 3 servers called off tonight, to which I replied, \"then you should be inside helping the waitress that did show up, not out here hiding on your cell phone.\" It's terribly unfortunate that this restaurant has such incompetent staff, because the food was actually really good. We will never be back."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. I ordered the caprese  burger and it was delicious. The new chef came and chatted with us and was very friendly. We will be coming back here to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"Such a small place...such big, amazing food! They know Italian is more than just tomato sauce and pasta. The calimari was perfect... And the pasta I had (I can't remember the name...lol)with pancetta in a cream sauce was out of this world! Can't wait to take my son there!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is like a needle in a hay stack! I did not have high expectations due to where it is located but when you walk in the restaurant it's very small but nice! They have a wood fire oven where they cook the pizzas. The pizza was great! I will surly come back again."}
{"text":"My thoughts on this place are as follows,
The service was kind of slow, but this was probably due to the large parties that came in and being short staffed. The live music was nice, it got a little loud to where you had to shout, to be heard.
My husband and I ordered:
the calamari fritti- it was good would be better if it wasn't cold.
Ceasar Salad- the croutons were really good, the lettuce was bitter and had wilted 
The pizza: actually pretty good, very similar to pizza in Italy. 
The linguine with meatballs: was ok, I've had better.



Overall I was satisfied. Was I blown away? No.
I will order pizza and pick it up next time, BC the pizza was good."}
{"text":"Don't bother! Good food, HORRIBLE service. My husband and I went with our three young kids for dinner one evening. There was one couple already eating, but nobody else in the place. Our server was incredibly unfriendly, but we didn't care too much. However, he forgot our salad, then completely ignored us for the remainder of our time there, while he watched TV in the bar (I got to shield my toddlers eyes from the bikini clad women and people blowing each other up on the big screen he was watching). The cook made our pizza, then proceeded to sit at the bar and take a shot, then drink another drink. Meanwhile, we never got our salad. Or drink refills. Or our check. We finally went up and asked for the bill, and it took forever from then to get out of there. But, the pizza was yummy, so we hoped it was a fluke.

Tonight, we called in an order (at 5:35pm) for two pizzas to be picked up. The man said it would be 25-30 minutes. My husband got there at 5:55, and was told it would be another 20 min, and that he could go wait OUTSIDE for it. At 6:25, he went back in and asked if the pizza was ready, and was told it would be another 10 minutes. The person made excuses and said they had a bunch of customers to help there (there were 4 tables of people in the whole place), so it was just taking longer for our pizzas. I finally told my husband at 6:30 to run somewhere else, as our kids were starving at that point! I called and told them not to make the pizzas, since it had been almost an hour (after being told 25-30 min), and the girl rudely said \"ok, that's fine!\" and hung up. 

Yikes. Never making that mistake again!"}
{"text":"Got tired of the typical franchise pizza places around me so I figured I try this place tonight for the first time, hell I drive by it everyday disregarding it might as well see what's it about. I DID NOT want to share this pizza after taking my very first bite!!!! Wood brick oven pizza is my favorite! Beware this place will make you a regular customer."}
{"text":"Easy to miss when you are driving by, but definitely worth going to! Pizza a Metro serves classic Italian salads, pastas and yes pizza at a good price. If you want to go some where less chain like than Brio but still have some great food, this is definitely the place to go! 

We stopped in for the lunch $5 specials. The specials are limited and I don't think the best representation of their food. But the spaghetti I had was good. The pesto pizza my friend got was very good. I can't wait to go back here for date night and try their full menu."}
{"text":"After walking into an awkwardly empty restaurant, we were seated by a VERY sweet young girl. She was the best staff member in that place, and she was probably 16. 

Sat for 10 mins and no one came and gave us a menu or took our drink order. One waitress kept walking back and forth, and another was eating and applying her lipstick. Mind you, there are 4 other people in this place. At this point, I'm done and we are just going to leave. As we are packing our baby up to just leave, they bring the menus. We let them know we are actually leaving, and with a smile one of the waitresses says as we walk out the door, \"have a nice day!\" At least their early exit service is friendly. . . 

Again, the young hostess was sweet and gave us the best service out of anyone in there."}
{"text":"Best pizza, high quality ingredients, everything was excellent, best service, great ambiance, it was a privilege eating here, thank you"}
{"text":"Pizza was REALLY good. Great ingredients, all the way around. service and attention to detail could be better."}
{"text":"Been back multiple times. Every time they knock it out of the park!!  Excellent service. Awesome freshly prepared food. The vodka cream sauce is to die for. Try it. You'll be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously an amazing place. This is my third visit and every time I try something new. Everything has been phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The food was great! But service was terrible! We literally sat there and watched our pizza on get cold on the table! It took an hour for us to get our food. The restaurant was empty and waiters were just standing there talking. The food was really good though...it's a shame the service sucked."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! MAKE SURE to see Alex (the chef) and he will even go out of his way to make and create something you want that's not on the menu!!! wood oven pizza my favorite is the margarita:) Octopus salad with grilled chicken is to die for, must try and highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The best wood oven pizza I've ever had!!!! Great service nice little hidden hole in the wall!!! Amazing menu and the chicken picatta to die for!!! Great place for lunch and take out!!! You have to try here guarantee no disappointment:)"}
{"text":"Many years ago my parents, who were \"foodies\", taught be a great lesson: seek out great food, no matter where the location or what it looks like from the outside. Well, that lesson proved successful today. 

From the outside, it doesn't look like much but don't let that fool you. We were quickly and kindly greeted, seated and decided upon the homemade gnocchi with vodka sauce and a pepperoni pizza. The food came out quickly and was delicious! The pizza crust is outstanding (perfect thinness and crispness), sauce is very fresh and cheese was tangy and perfect. This is truly now my favorite pizza in Phoenix! The gnocchi was outstanding with the vodka sauce w/basil. Generous portion was well. 

We ended the meal with a fabulous creme brûlée which was perfectly executed. 

The service was excellent. The prices are very reasonable as well. Can't wait to come back and enjoy some of their other specialties!"}
{"text":"Based on reviews from Yelpers (thanks!), my wife and I decided to eat at Pizza A Metro prior to the U2 concert. The entire experience was excellent. As stated in earlier reviews, the location is in a very small, somewhat ratty, strip-mall parking lot. Inside the restaurant, we were greeted with nicely painted walls, an intimate eating area and an unobstructed view of the kitchen, including the wood fired pizza oven.

Our host was the guy in the brown shirt holding the pizza in one of the pictures that were being displayed while I am writing this review.

Here's what we had:

Bread was brought out with a creative tapenade to pile on. Very nice.

Appetizer: Carpaccio. A thin shell of wonderful beef over a pile of fresh greens with just the right seasonings. 

Mains: I had the halibut special and my wife had pasta with vodka cream sauce. Both were excellent. One minor ding: The sauce with my halibut included olives, capers and artichoke hearts. I think they dumped too much olive juice in and it was too salty as a result. I have a very high tolerance before declaring \"too salty\". 

Wine: I had chianti and she had cab. The Chianti was better. 

Dessert: We passed as we were full from the meal.

I would definitely recommend this place and I would go back if I were anywhere near there."}
{"text":"At first we weren't so sure about this place but reviews on yelp convinced us to try it. Absolutely no regrets! Love the food!!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Not a great experience....We arrived about 7:50, the inside of the restaurant was half empty. We were seated right away, someone brought us a carafe of water after about 5 minutes. After another 10 minutes, with several wait staff walking balk and forth by our table, we had to flag someone down and ask for a server to come to our table.  5 minutes later she comes, we ask her what is on draft - she doesn't know. She lists one beer and we basically take it because she doesn't know the other options! About 15 minutes later 3 of our entrees come, but not my son's pizza. Another 15 minutes later and we are done eating and still no pizza.... seriously? we then ask for the pizza to be boxed to go and for our bill. She overcharges us for the \"special's\" of the night, and only changes it after I ask her to go look at the special board.....The 3 pasta dishes we had were good....but the service is HORRIBLE. The other reviews are accurate in this regard. There are TOO MANY other good restaurants nearby to have to deal with lousy service - for example, try Zappone's Italian Bistro on Higley and Baseline. We went there 2 Fridays ago and it was AMAZING - both food AND service. They will get our return business, Pizza A Metro will NOT, and that is unfortunate as we live about 2 minutes away... Their loss.
Addendum (10 minutes later): regarding the pizza mentioned above.... my son ordered a barbecue chicken pizza with NO ONIONS - the server commented when he ordered that he definitely knew both what he wanted and what he didn't want.... after getting home with the pizza that took forever, it has onions, LOTS of them. I originally gave them 2 stars - please subtract one and make it a 1 STAR. The service is not just poor, its unacceptable."}
{"text":"Yelpers get it right again! 

The SO and I decided on Salad and Pizza before settling in for a night of disk 1, season 3 of WEEDS.  So we head over to Pizza A Metro after a quick yelp search and cruise through the \"wes-side\" of Phoenix.  Pulled up to a mini-strip mall with a Circle K and a unisex hair salon which created great interest for us because we love \"off the beaten path\" kind of places. 

We step in, notice a very clean interior with a very nice staff too-boot.Take a gander at the menu and decide on the Antipasto della Casa for starters and the Frescolina fresh Pizza. As we're waiting for our Antipasto, we're served warm flat bread and a spread that appeared to be onions, olives, and peppers. It was great! We were again greeting by the owner who exchanges small talk throughout our night adding to our great evening out.

The Antipasto was an amazing array of olives, peppers, basil, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto,and eggplant. It was almost too pretty to eat and more than enough for the two of us. 

Next was the Frescolina Pizza. Man this was one killer pizza! Tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula, the perfect layer of flavor. The sweetness of the sauce, saltiness of the prosciutto, and the peppery/bitterness of the arugula made for a perfect blend. Wait, the crust! This crust was beyond real and there were no ends left on our plates.  Now that's great crust!

So we both agreed this was one hell-of-a place and we are going to be making our way through the menu along with our standing date with our next in queue Netflix-flick!"}
{"text":"SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!  AWESOME!  We came here with all the great review.  We got bread (complimentary).  I got the meatball soup (best I have every had).  The gnocchi with vodka sauce was fantastic, gnocchi was cooked to perfection.  The pizza was just plain freaking awesome.  Thin crust, not soggy!!  One of the best pizza I have ever had.  And then the tiramisu was perfect (not too sweet) and the cake was moist and not mushy.  The service was great too.  Caution, this place is buried in the end of the little shopping center (rough area), but it is worth it for GREAT food."}
{"text":"Update:

Visit on 4/29/16:  I don't know what happened since we first came here a week ago, but it's as if we walked into a different restaurant.  No one greeted us at the door with a smile.  No one said anything as we sat at the bar for 10 minutes.  The bartender (or the woman who was behind the bar) was speaking with other patrons when we sat down.  We she finished she just walked past us without a word, or a look, or anything.  As we sat and I looked around I made eye contact several times with another woman (not sure if she was a server or hostess or manager or what) but she just went on her way without acknowledging we were there.  The woman who was originally behind the bar cam back to the bar register, but still.....nothing.  Then she left and proceeded to set a table (or maybe she was bussing a table) behind us in the near empty restaurant.  Not like they needed to get that table ready because there was a line of people waiting.  There were though, two hungry and thirsty customers sitting at the bar.  A couple minutes later when she returned to the bar area to bring the gentlemen to our right their check, we thought relieved \"ok, she'll come take our order now\".  Fat chance.  She walked right by us again.  Like we were invisible.  That's when we got up to leave.  The bar woman saw us getting up and for the first time actually looked at us.  The BF called her over and told her exactly why we were leaving. That she was why we were leaving. Then she said smiling \"ok, well have a nice day\".  Really?  The whole situation was just surreal.  The whole vibe in there was different.  No one looked happy.  Certainly not happy that we were there.  Well, they don't have to worry because we will not be back.  I can't believe we thought this was going to be a new favorite spot.  Very disappointing.

Visit on 4/23/16:  What a great place!  From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we felt right at home.  The guy that greeted us at the door was smiling and friendly and told us about all the different seating options and asked where we would like to sit.  We sat at the bar, which was nice and roomy.  The chairs weren't crammed together like at so many other restaurants.  Kacee, the bartender, was just great.  Friendly and attentive.  She gave us great recommendations for our meals and we were never left sitting with an empty glass.  The food was amazing.  I had the roasted vegetable salad.  Seriously one of the best salads I've ever had.  The BF had the smoked chicken rigatoni which he said was amazing.  We both finished every last morsel.  We finished by sharing a chocolate mousse cake....also fabulous.  The only thing I didn't care for was the smoked butter that comes with the complimentary bread.  I though it tasted weird...but that's ok because I treated myself to dessert instead of chowing down the whole bread basket. The BF liked it though.  Anyway, so happy we found this cute neighborhood spot.  The decor is lovely and they have a cute outdoor patio too which we'll have to check out next time.  Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Pizza A Metro! My fiancé and I came here for the first time just after we got engaged and it was such a great atmosphere. The food too a little while, but not unreasonably so for the amount of people who were in the restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Piccata and he got a pizza. Both came out steaming hot and delicious. The wait staff were also extremely friendly and courteous. We will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"4 stars is being generous. It's more like 3.5. Ate there for the first time last night and I can say the food is okay, the service was very slow and the bar top was dirty (dirty plates, glass rings, ect). Probably won't make it a point to go back there... I personally thought it was pricey for the ambiance..."}
{"text":"A good local spot.  The wood oven pizza is delicious.  We usually get the Margherita pizza with sausage on it.    Have had many of the items on the menu and like them all.   The staff is very friendly.  The manager is very cool. Her name is Margarita also.  Very attentive to the customers.  Very personable.   The bartender was also very on top of refilling drinks when we sat at the bar for an after dinner cocktail the last time we were there.   Reviews are definitely opinions. Try for yourself!"}
{"text":"I'm notoriously skeptical of any restaurant that resides in some sort of strip mall.  You immediately lose 10 points off the ambiance/cool factor.  I also am reticent to eat anywhere that doesn't serve booze.  I just feel like the restaurant and I aren't on the same page and its a relationship destined for failure.

Pizza A Metro exists, if nothing else, to blow up my preconceived notions.  Were I to drive by PAM a hundred times I'd never think about going in.  But that'd be a mistake.  Its actually quite quaint for what it is inside.  And while they don't serve booze, they're glad to have you bring in your own wine for a modest corking fee (there's even a convenience store a few doors down if you're in a pinch and need an emergency bottle).

And the food was top notch.  No question, authentic italian (just like the owner).  This is the kind of place you can bring someone and have that 'Look at this undiscovered gem I found!' smirk on your face the whole time. I didn't get a chance to even try the Pizza, but that's all the more reason to go back."}
{"text":"OMG. The best fresh Italian food! I'm Sicilian and Calabrese, let me tell you...Gabriel and his staff make incredible food. Don't let this little place fool you!

Fine dining food in a casual setting. I repeat, fine dining food quality. 

The pizza is some of the best I've had. Fresh, beautiful ingredients. Terrific mozzerella. Great crust made in the wood  only hot oven. Not many places in AZ do wood only! 

You have to have their homemade gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. In-cred-i-ble. Out of this world good with some grated cheese on top!

I broke a 3 month no carb diet to come eat here. It was worth every gram of carbs! 

Stop what you're doing and drive here now. Trust me. You will be very happy you did. 

Sorry I didn't take any pics, we were too busy eating course by course!"}
{"text":"this was an all around awful experience.  from the second we walked into the door, we were welcomed to blaring music.  after placing our orders, the waiter delivered plates that appeared never to have seen a dishwasher.  my daughter ordered the children's spaghetti and meatballs, we were charged for an adult portion. both daughters had pasta, both dishes were awful.  and for the grand finale, the pizza.  the pizza came out cold, mind you, we were the only table in the entire restaurant that was eating. the pizza was so bad, that my wife and i feel strongly that it was heated up from the previous night, or from earlier in the day.  oh yeah, when we asked for a new pizza, the same pizza came back slightly heated with half eaten slices placed back on the server. the experience was so terrible, we did not even as for our money back, we just wanted to run for the hills after paying the bill."}
{"text":"I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.

This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.

The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!

So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him."}
{"text":"I always see this place because it is right by my work and finally decided to give it a try.  Absolutely love it!!!  The pizza is amazing!  I have also had the Chicken Cesar Salad, which is pretty yummy as well.  As an appetizer they give you baked dough pieces with a tomato vinegarette dipping sauce.  The staff is very friendly and always smiling.  I love Pizza A Metro!"}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time - previously I had ordered delivery.

Pretty cool! Nice little neighborhood Italian place, small and cramped, reminded me of New York a bit.

The Antipasto was a mixed bag. The mozzarella, salami, prosciutto, peppers, were great. The eggplant and mushrooms, less so. The bread - delicious! The olives were the terrible sliced canned variety. The proprietor said he is going to make his own from his olive tree - that should be better! In the meanwhile guys - a few good olives are better than a lot of shitty canned ones. I'm just sayin'. I wish they had some decent tomatoes, also.

Pasta was superb. I had the lasagna - it was fantastic. She had the special, some kind of linguine thing in white sauce with shrimp. It came with 4 giant shrimp. I felt like it could have had a few more, for the price, but that's just me! The flavor was great.

I brought a bottle of wine, the corkage fee was $5. Very nice.

They gave us a cannoli, on the house, as a dessert! It was superb. My friend, an ex-pastry chef, was impressed. I am from NY and was impressed. Good stuff. Yum!

I will be back! Nice little neighborhood spot, for sure!

They are going to stay open, longer - 9:30 during the week, open at 4 and close at 10 on the weekends, yay!"}
{"text":"My lactose intolerant friend noshed on pizza and carbonara because it was that good. One of my favorite Italian places of all time and I try to visit every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pizza and service is consistent. We've never been disappointed with either. Worth the money."}
{"text":"Everyone that works there is so friendly and attentive. The wood fired pizza is excellent. We wish they would have a happy hour menu for food and drinks. We were there one night and the guitar player was excellent. It is so nice to have a place to go to listen to live music"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked ever since it started showing up as a hot spot on Yelp.  And, I'd have to say, at this point, this is my favorite find off of Yelp.  It is close-ish to me which is super exciting as well.  Half way through my meal, I was dreaming of getting take-out nights after a long day at work (it is even closer to where I work).  It was just that good!

The owner is ADORABLE and provides entertainment through out the meal.  An Italian speaking family happened to be in the restaurant when we arrived, and they were throwing around Italian like crazy.  I enjoyed this as I got to pretend I knew what they were saying and construct a dialogue in my head.  

My friend and I shared the caprese salad- standard, vegetarian pizza-delicious and spaghetti pomodora-amazing.  I usually don't order things like spaghetti at restaurants but it seemed to be calling my name, and I'm so glad I was listening.  The sauce is awesome and had my taste buds dancing.  

I loved it, and went home very happy with my meal.  I feel pity for people who are part of the anti-carb cult and might miss out on such a gem."}
{"text":"Really good pizza if you can stand the load music and goofy servers. We went during a baby shower and even thought they were super busy they treated us with the same attentiveness as any other visit. A+"}
{"text":"A guy at our hotel told us to eat at Pizza A Metro. We saw it and kept on driving. Let's just say this place scores a negative 5 stars in drive up appeal. My wife pulled up reviews on Yelp and they were so good that we turned around and went back.

In my experience with Italian food, it all tastes pretty good. You can make it at home and it tastes pretty good. You can go to a popular chain and it tastes pretty good. You can go to an upscale place where the servers are mature Italian men and it tastes pretty good. Italian food is just good. I'll eat it anytime at almost any place.

For the first time in my life, at Pizza A Metro, I had Italian food that transcended just about every other dining experience I can remember. This was one of the top 5 best meals I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Pizza A Metro was very great restaurant. Service was very friendly and professional and Food was excellent specially their pizza bread is very good. One of the BEST Restaurants I've had to eat. 
GREAT JOB!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep this review fairly short. 

My husband and I split a vegeterian pizza and it was very delicious. Big pieces of veggies and they all tasted pretty fresh and the crust was very good.

The service was weird and friendly. First the weird. One of the servers I asked if they had a wine list or served wine and he spoke so quiet I barely heard him, but he did say he would check and then he disappered for a few minutes, reappeared only to walk right by us. About 10 minutes later the owner (I think he is the owner) came by and asked me what kind of wine I liked, but by that time I had changed my mind.

I would say the only draw back is how small the place is. We were seated right next to the kitchen and it felt kind of cramped. 

Other than that I very much enjoyed the pizza and look forward to ordering from there again. Their lasagna sounds very tasty so I would like to try it out sometime."}
{"text":"Nice place...they had someone playing a guitar that couldn't sing.. so that was interesting. ..let's start with the food...I had spaghetti. .it was very watery and no flavor until I added salt...my dish was served with no bread. .didn't seem right...The service. .I don't have any restaurant experience but I could tell the staff is disorganized and running into each or over each other..I don't recommend this place or would I come back and I live 2 blocks away..."}
{"text":"The original owners from sorrento Italy do not own the place now.  The prices and new menu may be cheaper, but the quality of their food has deteriorated, along with the service. The blonde server is the owners daughter and had to ask the cook in the back what beef carpacio is.  It used to be on their menu.  The garlic in the bolognase was too strong.  The caprese had mozzarella that could have been bought at your local grocery store.  It was not fresh, nor were the tomatoes.  The new owners might have the recipes, but lack the basic knowledge of Italian cuisine and customer service.  They are coasting on the reviews from the past owners."}
{"text":"I know everyone is raving about their pizza, which IS very good, but I can't get enough of their homemade ravioli with vodka sauce it is absolutely killer."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends Birthday surprise party for the first time. Very cozy and nicely decorated inside. My Husband and I sat at the bar until guest arrived. We met Tiny who helps run the place and he was very friendly. I asked what was being served in the buffet because I am on a low carb special diet. He said he would have the chef make me up something special. He surprised me with a steak kabob... Not something you would get on a Italian menu! It was delicious!! I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic Restaurant... The food is excellent.... The Atmosphere is probably my favorite part... Highly recommended for a cool date spot.

A+"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Its very clean and the manager is always checking to ensure your experience is good and that your get bread.  They are evolving into a great little place for dinning."}
{"text":"Very tasty wood fired pizza. Pasta pomodoro was good but not great. My son very much enjoyed his calzone. Service was very attentive which brings this review up from a three and a half to a four. The feel was an odd mix of fine dining and casual with white tablecloths and kids running in and out from the patio to the dining room. 
We would probably return for the pizza."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I have eaten at. It looks good on the outside and inside but that where it ends. The wait for ordering was excessive, the waitress did not know the menu, the bread was burnt, no silverwear when our meals arrived, our order was wrong, the minestrone soup was not soup or minestrone, the side vegetables had a sickly gas taste to it, my veal marsala was tough and the sauce was unappetizing. My to-go order was spaghetti & meatballs. I ask for double the sauce but hardly got any and only got 2 meatballs. The service should have been better since there was hardly anybody in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The service is slow and leaves you wanting. One of their hosts was taking a personal phone call while he was seating patrons. He was more focused on arranging his evening than helping the customers. The bartender made a comment about being busy but not even 1/4 of the tables were full. The lack of acknowledgement and service was very frustrating. I wish I could rate the food but the lack of service and disorganized management of the restaurant caused me to leave. After waiting over 15 minutes it just was not worth waiting to see what surprises awaited with the food. Simply put, we walked out because there was no service."}
{"text":"I meant to write a review of this place a while back.  My boyfriend and I went here for dinner based on the reviews on Yelp.  I called ahead, fearing it might be crowded, because we were both starving.  The man who answered the phone (possibly the manager or owner?) was very friendly, said that if we were coming right then he could save us a table, and took my name.  

We immediately went there, and, amazingly, even though there were a few people seemingly waiting outside, he really did save a table for us!  We were seated right away.  I was kind of surprised how small it was--it may be a good idea to call ahead to see what the wait is like.  

Anyhow, we ordered a pizza (forget which one....it had prosciutto (no clue how to spell that correctly) and arugula.  It was DELICIOUS!  We also ordered the special, which was a seafood pasta dish that had scallops and shrimp.  I didn't try it, but my boyfriend said that it was quite good.  Oh, and I believe we also had an appetizer--a tomato, basil, mozzarella salad.  It was very tasty as well.  

The pizza had a thin crust and was very delicious and flavorful.  I almost ate the entire thing, and it was a pretty big pizza.  It was that good.  We were pretty stuffed after the meal and decided not to order dessert, even though I was mildly curious about it.  But, despite that, the manager (?) or owner (?) brought us tiramisu, on the house.  It was extremely creamy and delicious.  

I officially love this place.  Everything was so good, and the service was excellent and so friendly.  Since then we've ordered take-out pizza from them, and it was equally as delicious as the first time around.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So me and my friend went there and I was generally surprised to see the fancy look for the location. We were sat down immediately. The first red flag was when the server had on old nasty nikes. The second red flag was that the waiter had to be flagged down to take my order after 15 minutes. Oh and they're playing Christmas music in july. The pizza is still in the oven but I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Gilbert. Not so much secret anymore for me and my friends and family. Best italian food you can find. Thin crust pizzas are really good. Recommended to everyone!!! Perfect patio seating."}
{"text":"I don't like pizza. But Pizza A Metro makes you rethink pizza. A hidden gem in an unassuming strip mall in Gilbert - you walk in & are transported: gorgeous neo-baroque décor & a wood fire oven - open space & comfort for Parties with superior customer service. Full bar & first class wine selection to boot! And if you get to meet Margarita, you will never be the same..."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant! 

This is always the place chosen for Holidays, Birthday, any special occasion or just as a treat. 

The owners couldn't be more welcoming and their passion for cooking will always keep us coming back for more. 

We've tried most of their menu and it's spectacular. The appetizer of warm bread w/ special dish for dipping is just the perfect starting dish. Their salads, Mussels, Calamari couldn't be better.

I always get a Italian Margarita (Sangria or other mixed drink), The Chicken Parmigiana w/ homemade pasta, I would choose this as my last meal. My husband will order the Pasta Bolognese or any of their other pasta dishes. 

Desserts- all delicious! They are the treats on top of the best treat for lunch or dinner. 

I LOVE everything about the people and food at Pizza A Metro!


Valentine's Day Dinner... Oh our food Cupid, DELICIOUS!  Never do they disappoint and I'm even more in awe of their cooking every experience after the best experiences, it was the best Valentines dinner my husband and I have shared together in 14 years!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, thin and greasy pizza. Their pizzas range from small to \"how am I gonna fit this in my car\". Their toppings are tasty and fresh, and their sauce isn't overtly sweet like many places, its thin and packed with delicious flavor along with the rest of the pizza. 

The location itself is small, packed into a strip mall with a Circle K and plenty of vagrants so you may feel like take out is a better option. The inside is tiny but charming and the food will immediately make you forget that you're going to be pressed for change the second you reach your car.

I would definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for a delicious wood fired pizza in the heart of the city, they even have a ton of tasty pasta options and a three foot pizza guarenteed to be a party pleaser."}
{"text":"Pizza a metro in Gilbert is the spot! Great food, full bar, excellent service. Caroline is super friendly, Alex is the world's greatest chef. Try them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Free bruchetta with excellent flavor. ordered a margherita pizza. it was light and tasty. excellent lunch!"}
{"text":"Lived in northern Italy for six years. This is one of only 5 places I've found in the states that does pizza right. I just wish they had a bigger selection of pizza to choose from. I'd give 5 stars if they had an actual salimino picante pizza, a grana arugula pizza, or a tuna red onion pizza."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new Italian place that was cheap and within a 15 minute drive. This place caught our eye, and I'm so glad it did. It's located next to a Circle K, and it's pretty tiny (maybe 3 4-person tables and 4 two-person tables), but don't let that stop you. The food is delicious, and the service phenomenal for a place where it seems only two people are doing all of the cooking, serving, and bussing. 

They gave us this delicious appetizer to start, with a balsamic-y tomato dip thing served with pizza crust. It took all my self control to not eat it all, and share with the boy. I got the shrimp Romantica with a side house salad. The salad had a delightful vinaigrette, and the pasta had a deliciously simple sauce, sauteed mushrooms, and well-cooked, juicy shrimp. It was probably the best shrimp I've had with pasta in a long time.

 My s/o got the Hawaiian, which had a lovely thin crust. The cheese is not what you usually find on pizzas (embarrassed to say I don't know what kind of cheese), which he didn't particularly like, but I liked that whatever it was and the fact that the pizza wasn't smothered in the cheese really allowed the different flavors of the crust, sauce, and toppings to shine through.

We ended the night with the creme brulee, which had strawberry syrup on top. This is the only part of the meal I wouldn't do again--but the again I don't like caramel or cream, so it's not surprise I didn't like it! (However, the s/o who loves creme brulee also didn't enjoy it that much). Next time I'm going to get the chocolate mousse cake.

This place is probably going to become our new go-to for Italian date nights. Thanks Yelp for helping me find this place, and I hope I help more of you find it too!"}
{"text":"A friend of my husband's gave him a gift card to this place and told him they had great food.   We decided to give it a try.   There were four in our party and we were lucky to get a table since it is a very, very small restaurant.   Items ordered between the party of four:  Italian wedding soup, eggplant parm, pasta with bolognese sauce, house salad and pizza with sausage, onion and basil.   The pizza barely had any onions on it.   Very little sauce and cheese.   I didn't try the eggplant parm, pasta or italian wedding soup but other party members stated the food was average.    One of the reasons I'm giving it only one star is due to very poor customer service   The waiter could barely speak english then when we presented our gift card the owner came out an told us he would not accept the gift card.   He stated the gift cards were purchased when someone else owned the restaurant and he was not obligated to honor it.   There was no way we would know this as the gift card we were given had the same restaurant logo as is currently in use.   My husband's friend would have no way of knowing this restaurant was sold or when it was sold.   This place is in a bad neighborhood too.   I didn't feel too safe around there."}
{"text":"The food was so amazing!!! The portions are big. And the prices are amazing for the quality of food and how much food you get. You can watch your pizza cook in the brick oven and you can watch them make it. I cannot express how much I loved everything. They also have a large variety of other, non pizza, dishes to choose from and they are just as delicious. The service was fabulous."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and I ordered chicken Marsala and it came out more like a chicken piccata.  Wasn't happy with it, but it tasted good.  My pregnant wife also had to send her pasta pomodoro back too because it didn't have sauce.  I would have given them a one star but they took my meal off because I didn't eat it and they offered to refire a new one, I think they were having a off night.  I would give it one more shot maybe."}
{"text":"We love pizza and were very excited to try this place. From the minute we called in to place our take out order we had awful service. We got hung up on and then when we called back the girl seemed irritated that we wanted to place an order. When we walked in to the restaurant there was only 2 tables seated and nobody at the front to greet us. We saw two pizza boxes sitting on the bar top counter and assumed those were ours. After a few minutes of standing there a girl with curly dark hair came from the back, printed a receipt with the total, placed it on the counter not even near where we were standing and walked back to the kitchen. We could have walked out with our pizza and nobody would've even known. We stood there and waited to pay and when she finally came back she just stood there and stared at us not even saying one word. We handed her our card and she swiped the card and gave us the receipt and then walked away once again. No word said to us. As we left, there was an employee walking in and we asked if we would be able to speak to a manager. He advised that there wasn't a manager there and advised us that the girl that helped us was the managers daughter. He did the best he could to attempt to rectify the situation but at that point we just wanted to get out of there. After getting home, we opened our pizza and our what was supposed to be half cheese and half pepperoni had about 2 of 8 slices of cheese pizza. Not only that but we had to microwave our pizza due to it sitting out on the counter. All the negative reviews are true as we experienced the same exact thing. Family or not, you may need some new employees as your front hostess isn't helping your best. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian place!  Eat inside or outside.  Plenty of parking.  I came here on a weeknight at 630.  Nice interior.  Great chill music by Pandora.  TV also available.  Great healthy mix green salad.  Complimentary pizza dough chips and Italian salsa.  Supreme pizza was very good, thinnish crust, good amount of ingredients.  They even use a brick oven !!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pizza a Metro is still off the chain.... The only reason i gave it 4 stars before was a lack of consistency in the white sauce on their pasta.  They broke the sauce once, but that has never happened since.  With that issue corrected, I needed to update."}
{"text":"I called in a pasta order ahead.  I tried two dishes.  The chicken parm and one other dish.  The sauces were tasty but a bit on the salty side as the other reviews have mentioned.  AND I LOVE SALT!!

I don't know what it was but the staff (owner and cook) were both very nice but for some reason I felt awkward in that place like I was an unexpected guest.  Then again, I'm a younger, sharper dressed, fine watch, imported car kind of American boy and this strip mall isn't in the part of town that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.. It wasn't enough to turn me off but I did feel weird being in there.

The food was good overall with the exception of being really salty.  At least it isn't bland and has flavor.  

I will surely give them another shot and try the pizza..."}
{"text":"Do not go here... really. Do not go. I am stunned that they have good reviews. Has the world gone mad? 

The organization of the restaurant is so bad it's hard to fathom. Head on over to one of the other amazing restaurants in downtown Gilbert and wait in line. 

I live in the neighborhood and am a local business owner so I always try to patronize locally owned restaurants. I kept giving this place a chance because the food is decent, but it's not worth the ridiculousness you must go through to actually get it delivered to your table! 

This place is deserted for a reason. It's a crap shoot if you will actually get your meal or not. 

I'm guessing that their delivery service is the only thing keeping them in business. 

Don't go here if you value good service. No food is worth disrespect."}
{"text":"amazing \"balsamic salsa\" served with pizza bread chips instead of bread, and a wonderful eggplant parm. Only gripe? can't access menu directly online, have to go thru a takeout website."}
{"text":"The restaurant is called, \"Pizza A Metro\" and it's basically in the Circle K Shopping Center, NORTH SIDE OF Indian School & I-7, so \"non-descript\" a location, it brings new meaning to \"nondescript location\".
 
What do I want in an Italian restaurant?  First of all, owner/operator is ideal.  After that, it's just flavor.  Flavor is key.  You can make a nice table, cloth napkins, but a nice restaurant has to serve food with flavor. 
 
It's a pizza restaurant, I ordered lasagna.  Oh.  My.  God. So good. 
 
I've posted the pictures.  The sauce on the lasagna was a perfect blend of garlic and tomatos.  Perfectly seasoned.  The lasagna noodles weren't just \"al dente'\",  they were pillowy al dente'.  I've never had a better lasagna noodle; I don't think I've ever had better lasagna.
 
Before I post this review, I'm going back for pizza, so, without posting in two parts
 
 Pizza A Metro, PART TWO...

 ...is unfortunately different then part 1, but because I'm honest I'm going to tell you the story precisely the way that it happened from my point of view:

The 1st photo that you see is the Pizza A Metro margarita pizza, with mushrooms that I ordered.  I never once mentioned basil.  I don't think, other than a leaf or two as a garnish, a Pizza Margarita has any basil. [see photo] I certainly never mentioned THIS MUCH basil.  And FAR WORSE 

Tasted like straw.  IT RUINED THE PIZZA
 
As I waited for my pizza a heavy-set, middle-aged mother came in with a child who wanted to run amok and ignored the inept mom, and kept stepping on my shoes.  After the third time of stepping on my shoes, I said something. She took the kid angrily by the hand, \"...we're not eating here, let's go!\"...confirming everything I thought about her ability to parent.

I wasn't rude.  I just said that ignoring me -- and the kid -- wasn't helping the appearance of my once-white tennis shoes. 

I felt horrible.  Not for the inept mom, but for the restaurant owners. Certainly it wasn't my intention to cost these nice restaurant people a pizza purchase but I didn't like my shoes being stepped on, so even if my comments were ill-advised, AND THEY WEREN'T, I felt bad, responsible. 

The owner said nothing after the incident, which he saw from the full 7 feet it stands from the oven.  

Then my pizza comes and it's got green straw all over it.  Which is just not acceptable. And, it's not the worst crime here...THE WORST CRIME?  it's frigging old.  Old basil. 
 
And I then it dawns on me and I recall another photo this Chef has posted, and it all clicks in...   

The owner of Pizza A Metro has posted a photo of he with 
his \"Mentor In Bland\", 
                       
                               Chef Tomaso Maggiore.  Oh God.

The guy who invented bland, bad Italian food in Phoenix.  Go ahead, smart guy/girl: tell me the last GREAT MEAL you had at a Tomaso's restaurant.  I'm waiting.  I had one good meal on Camelback 20 years ago, I tried going back, it's just so mediocre.  And he's treated like the fgigging Godfather...

Let me desconstruct the pizza because I can: 

      * crust: 7.6/10: really very good; 
      * sauce: 2/10, maybe 1.9/10; 
         bland, nothing is there.  Why bother.  
        Bland is code in Italian for horrible.   
     * Cheese: 7.1, very good. Nice texture, 
        good flavor, not crap cheese, no   
        grease;
     * Unwanted basil:  ZERO.point.ZERO.  ZERO.point.ZERO.  ZERO.point.ZEROZERO.point.ZEROZERO.point.ZEROZERO.point.zero  
     
I have other reviews of Tomaso's spots.  Not horrible, bland. Equalling horrible.

20 minutes after my pizza is at my table, Raphael yells, with that big, fake toothy Tomaso's grin, \"...pizza good?!!!!!!!!!!!\".  \"No.  It has old basil on it.\"
 
  BUT HERE'S THE BIG PROBEM, RAPHAEL and ANNALESE (SP?): 

If you feel comfortable in sacrificing my entire pizza, my ENTIRE meal with old, $hit basil, how do I trust you on mushrooms?  How do I trust you on crust?  On anything?  OH!  THE ANSWER IS: 

                  I DO NOT TRUST YOU
    
YOU USED OLD BASIL AND THOUGHT IT WAS OK.  
                        -- IT IS NOT OK 

The $hit you served me Thursday night was $hit.  Absoute $hit.  I'll ask you again: who taught you that?  Who taught you (Tomaso?) using old basil was okay?  And then charging me for that crap...?

It's not ok. Not.  You can go here but what are you getting?  Fresh food? I didn't get fresh food."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place with a great menu.  They have delicious gourmet burgers on Wednesdays.  Their gnocchi is also very good!"}
{"text":"We finally tried Pizza A Metro after years of living 5 minutes away- not sure why it took us so long, but j don't think we will be rushing back too soon. We ordered a couple of pizzas and the spinach salad. I didn't  like the salad at all and the pizza was just okay. We are devote pizza snobs ...so we will be sticking with our faves! Bummed that it wasn't better!"}
{"text":"This was the worst example of Italian food I've ever had in the states.  I'm an Italian immigrant so I know Italian food extremely well as I grew up eating it in my home country.  I've tried eating at this restaurant two times and both times the food was not good and not even close to being authentic. The food came out very slow and the restaurant seemed like was still in need of cleaning up from the previous evening.  Looking through the menu they can't even keep their food descriptions correct let alone the spelling.  If you are going to claim that you are an authentic Italian restaurant at least put in the effort to learn to spell the ingredients correctly instead of substituting your own words in, like regatta instead of ricotta or using tomato instead of pomodoro in your dish names (raviolo al tomato).  The only redeeming quality was that the wait staff was pleasant.  I will not be giving this place a third attempt and suggest that others don't either unless the food improves drastically."}
{"text":"Fucking GREAT pizza!  This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town.  I had a cheese and peperoni pie.  The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible.   Wow.

The restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice.  

If you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Wow, 3 years of driving by and never stopped. I regret it. Food was fantastic. Drinks were cold. Service was slower but very family like. We will come here often."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  This place is so, so great.

The service: A+.  The owner (manager?) was out and about amongst the tables the whole night making conversation, asking if everything was OK, and just making it a welcoming experience in general.  It is a very small restaurant - only about 8 tables - but, still.  The man made an effort!  A really sweet guy who cares 110% about his business.

The dinner: A+.  The pizza was melt-in-your-mouth delectable.  Thin, tasty crust topped with just the right amount of lightly seasoned marinara, fresh mozzarella, and ripe toppings (mine were mushrooms, spinach, ham, olives - OK, I know ham can't be \"ripe\", but you get the point).   I ordered the small, which was still pretty big...I think 12\"...and I seriously ate 6 out of the 8 pieces.  My stomach was saying no, but my tastebuds craved more and more.  My friend also had a pizza, and enjoyed hers just as much.

The dessert: A++.  This gets 2 pluses because the owner brought us a complimentary piece of tiramisu in addition to the cannoli we ordered!   Let me tell you, both were straight out of an Italian kitchen that goes back generations.  My grandmother made a tiramisu close to this one...yikes!  Did I just say that out loud?? *flushes* 

Too bad I don't live in Phoenix, because this would be my new favorite place.  But, now I have something to look forward to when I go back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Sat outside on Valentine's Day. Ordered pizza. Loved the crust.  Next time I'll order extra sauce. A little light."}
{"text":"A meter of pizza? I'll just have one lol. 

Tried put this pizza today when a friend took me. We ordered a meter with half pepperoni and half meatball.  The thin crust was crispy crunchy and the sauce reminded me of Red Devil. The meats were good  the pepperoni was my favorite. 

If you're looking to feed a small country or a pack of teenagers this is for you. I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Got the Margarita Pizza. However the pasta was ok and the place was somewhat too small. Services was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Tiny place but delicious! Don't be fooled by the neighborhood.
I got the veggie pizza and it was so good!
The service was great, the owner himself was out there refilling my drink.
Reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Pizza A Metro has a sign out front advertising 50% off all wine on Mondays. We purposely went on a Monday and when we mentioned the 50% off on wines, the waiter knew nothing about it. Charged us full price and implied that the sign was not theirs!! Then when I contacted them via their website with a complaint, got absolutely no response. Will not be back!!"}
{"text":"poor execution, no coordination in the kitchen, less than savory ingredients.
===

What is it about Phoenicians and any pizza not served by Dominos or Pizza Hut? They go gaga for it. They 5-star it. They vote it number one in the nation and it makes Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit).

I was excited about this place given all the extremely high reviews and yelp hype; they even have their Yelp window sticker. I arrived without a reservation and my guests and I were seated right away. Service was prompt and the food runner/buser, while very timid, was on the ball refilling our drinks.

The thin-crust pizza dough, cut into small pieces for the bread tray was served hot and crispy from the oven, but there was no inspiration, no flavor. The sweet olive salad that accompanied it was the same, sweetened by something, but nothing more. The kitchen needs someone to light the spark, get them to THINK before they just drop the plate for pickup.

The caprese salad was beautiful, but arrived with no pepper, no salt, and no olive oil. It was there on the table, but, really? I'm of the camp that the s/p shakers are there for decoration only; the kitchen is supposed to season my order correctly. If the kitchen isn't going to do it, at least offer freshly ground pepper at the table by the server. Is this a do-it-yourself menu?

I ordered the grilled calamari salad because I'm tired of breaded-and-fried. Unfortunately the only taste I got from the salad were the flavors from the grill left over from other meat that was \"recently\" prepared there. I hope recently means just that day, no earlier. No dressing, no tossed-with-anything before plating, zip. Salad mix was straight from the Dole pre-mix bag.

The main courses from the kitchen arrived all at once, but we were told the veggie pizza was still on its way. Seven minutes later it arrived, and being polite diners, the rest of us had waited. You guessed it, ours were cold. Lasagna was overcooked and mushy, uninteresting with the gobs of pizza sauce piled on it; I could have done better at the ready-wrap from Fresh and Easy. Cream sauce from the artichoke dish was so rich and thick, it could be called cheese; yuck. The artichokes themselves hadn't been peeled and the outer chewy leaf was still on! The veggie pizza's crust was the same bland bread we had just sampled, its veggies too thickly cut to cook properly, so they were partially raw with cool centers.

We were offered a tiramisu as dessert and it was sumptuous.

I hope that I get to update this review with a better result next time, but for now, what these cooks need is a good kick in the pants.

GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!"}
{"text":"Well, I liked this place a lot, but this last time really did me in. The last two times I love their BBQ chicken pizza, it was my favorite. But we went in today and waited 20 minutes for the blandest version of this pizza. Piece number two and I realize there's a fly in the pizza. YUM! So not only was it just a cheese pizza with chicken thrown on it, there's now a fly. I know stuff happens, but there was nothing but cheese and chicken. No onions or cilantro like usual. Bummed out. Thought I found a pizza place up here. Now I'm forced to search again."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing, great atmosphere, and amazing customer service!!! I would recommend it to any of my friends or family members. I'll give it a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Just to be clear, this is a 3.5 star review and I'm rounding up to 4 stars (see below).

 I finally had the opportunity to try Pizza A Metro last week when I met up with a friend who lives in the area.  He advised that we should get takeout since sometime the restaurant can get crowded with the limited seating and a little inconvenient with people waiting for pie with their butts right next to your table.  We called in our order for a Margherita and were told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  We stopped at the supermarket on the way for some wine and headed straight to pick up the pie, which was waiting for us on the counter when we got there.  Headed quickly back to my friend's for the grub.

All I can say...I definitely see the promise in Pizza A Metro.  I think something got lost, maybe the pizza was sitting on the counter for a bit, maybe the drive took too long to get home, but when I ate, the pizza wasn't piping hot and the crust didn't have a nice crispness to it like I would have liked.  Very good flavors and the crust still was good.  I could definitely see liking this pizza more than Cibo (which I like better than Bianco).  The two leftover slices were quite nice as I used the toaster oven to get a nice crisp on the crust.

Usually for a place I'm going to for the first time, i'd round down to three stars.  However, the friend I was there with has been many times and loves it and he is pretty spot on grub...so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"This would have a been a great pizza if it had been hot. I ordered take out, went to pick it up and it was just sitting on the bar. Obviously for a while because the pizza was cold. Not even room temperature! Cold. Definitely won't order take out from here ever again."}
{"text":"Pizza a Metro recently opened up (used to be Via's pizza). My brother had told me he went for a pizza (pie) there to try it out. They have a woodstove that they cook their pizzas in. He was very impressed. So.. I took a chance and brought my daughter along.  The restaurant is really lovely inside and has linen table cloths and napkins. The staff are very nice and very attentive. Of course there was only one other couple there at the time. So not sure how they would measure up to a full house.
My daughter ordered her usual.. lasagna and I ordered a pizza. Now I will say this.. their sauce on the lasagna was in one word.. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! 
However their need to tighten up their technique when it comes to both dishes. The pasta was WAY OVER COOKED. And the pizza was not cooked completely.  When you pick up a piece of pie and it hangs down to the floor... there is a problem there. I ended up taking the outer crust and dipping it into the sauce... because again.. it was AMAZING! If they can perfect their cooking methods.. I will be back, but not until then."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and the food tasted good but it was way too overpriced for the portion size and NOTHING comes with it. A tiny piece of lasagna swimming in sauce for 16 dollars is absolutely ridiculous. A dinner salad and some garlic bread would be a perfect addition and then the price would make more sense. Not worth returning. We left minus 100 dollars and still hungry"}
{"text":"Returned on Monday, ate some wonderful Linguini Carbonara, got the gnocchi, had the Calamari salad and the Ceasar salad... Again lovely food. 
The main reason for this update is that they are opening on Sundays starting August 24th! Whoo -hooo!  He is thinking that during the fall it might make sense to be open on Sundays. Let's prove him right.
----
Went again, tried the Seafood Ravioli and another Pizza... Tasty! We're quite hooked on the Linguini Carbonara though. While the Seafood Ravioli was delicious, it was 6 ravioli. We each got two and, portion wise, it's not enough. Quality not quantity, I know. Now my child wants the ravioli all to herself next visit. Will she ever eat Chef boy R Dee again? I don't think so. Just a parental warning. Eating quality foods may diminish your childs ability to be satisfied with 10 cans for 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I wanted to lick my plate! ! The pear salad was absolutely awesome and I wanted more!  I wanted dessert so only had the salad and the shrimp scampi which was four perfect shrimp in a delicious garlic sauce.  Dessert was tiramisu which tastes incredible . There was live music on Friday night and the singer was amazing and added to the fun of a family night out.  This like gem is hidden but go and enjoy.  I hope they keep on doing what they are doing. ..!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. They saved Christmas Eve. If you don't live near them, they are worth taking a trip to."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere nice patio. Meat lovers pizza was great.
Staff was super friendly prices were a little high but I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is the most Authentic, and delicious Italian restaurant in the whole valley! Closest thing to being in Italy! The people are super friendly, the service is exceptional, the environment is cozy and elegant. The food takes a little longer because its fresh and hand made cooked slowly in a brick oven. Believe me, It's worth it! Order a Pino Noir and relax. Try the Napoli pizza or the eggplant tower!"}
{"text":"Deceptively fantastic. Like Lady Gaga. Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of mid-range Italian restaurants.

It's so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up. Oh, man, Ben, we could get in a knife fight at a location like this! Sweeet!

It's not that bad. But the food is righteous. The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil. We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites. We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli. Perfect cheese, perfect crust, yum sausage, perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli.

It's clean and warm on the inside. Try it. You like it. And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant we've been to in a long time. The salmon Lombardo was fabulous!!!!  It looks like just a hole in the wall restaurant but the food was better than many 5 star restaurants. Or actually most!!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think of stopping here if you had not heard about it, in fact if you were looking for a Circle K, you might pass the one up in this strip center and look for a more inviting looking one. We parked in front of a dollar store with Spanish signage. Inside, Pizza a Metro was very modern and upscale, with 6 marble tables and seating for 20. A counter for pizza ordering and pickup also displayed an assortment of liquor. The service was lively and friendly. Lorenzo, who was from Naples and the owner's cousin, was running the place and waiting tables. 

All orders come with a plate of flatbread strips and Caponata. We split an order of Carpaccio, which I thought was great but my dining companion thought needed a little more seasoning. The flatbread was a nice companion for the Carpaccio. We both ordered pasta dishes. I went with the Linguini Carbonara, while she had the Gnochi with Marinara sauce. The Carbonara was the best that I have had outside of Italy, she thought that Gnochi and sauce were wonderful, although she found the Marinara a little salty (should have used some of the salt on the Carpaccio). Desert was a Cannoli and Tiramasu, both heavenly. The Cannoli shells were perfect, the filling ultra-creamy yet nontraditional (chocolate). 

We did not try the pizza, but observed people coming and going for carryout. The pies come in three sizes, personal, large and metro. Pizza a Metro means pizza by the meter and the metro is an oval 39\" pizza. We grabbed a carryout menu and as this is about 1.5 miles from home, we will be trying the pizza. 

Prices were low for what they were serving but not cheap. We saw a couple of groups that came in, sat down, got menus, then left. Large pizzas are in the $12-14 range. Entrees average about the same. Our meal as described above plus 1 glass of wine came in at $60. 

Cons: the beverage choices were nearly nonexistent. Due to some equipment issue that would be resolved \"tomorrow\" there was no diet soda, no bottled water and no coffee. So it was alcohol or plastic bottles of Coca-Cola. If this were more than a temporary issue I would take a star off the review. 

Given its location and great food, we will be back and look forward to the next visit.
=====
So the time came to order pizza for carryout.  I called up and they said it could be ready in 10-15 minutes, I asked if they could do 20 and Lorenzo said that would work.  Ordered a small Bolognese and a regular meatball.  When I arrived there were two boxes on the counter.  \"Two meatball pizzas?\" asked the guy who makes the pizzas.   They had the order wrong.  Lorenzo intervened and told me it would take 10 minutes to do the Bolognese or I would have to take what was there.  So I waited.  There was no apology or offer of a discount or some flatbread to munch on while I waited.  The second pizza was ready quite quickly. 

The Meatball Pizza was something I will order again, but it was a little cold from sitting on the counter while the other pizza was made.  The meatballs were really tasty.  The Bolognese could have been cooked longer, I guess they wanted to get me out of there quickly.  These were very good pizzas, fundamentally, they just had logistical issues.  I am going to try this again, but it seems like the place could be better managed.  Again, my dining companion thought the Bolognese was too salty.  If I had more granularity here I would reduce my review to 3.5 stars based on this experience.  Going back though, the meatball pizza had real promise."}
{"text":"A former coworker and I stumbled upon this place for lunch. As the other reviews said there is limited parking (park across the street at Arby's), the neighborhood is sketchy with guys hanging around outside, and seating inside is limited - but it is worth the obstacles to come here. We ordered the Margarita pizza and it was absolutely the best I have had this side of Naples. 

Fred M. mentioned he was downgrading since the bread and tapenada was gone - time to give that point back because they were served with our meal.The staff was friendly and the pizza was incredible. Reasonably priced too. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place last year when we came down for Spring Training we decided to try it again this year. We were not disappointed at all! Food was great and prices are reasonable! This place will most likely become part of our yearly family tradition!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight for carryout. Ordered spaghetti and meatballs. $9.99 for pasta and 2 meatballs. Barely enough sauce to cover the spaghetti. I almost opened a jar of Ragu. No sides. No bread. Imitation Italian meal at best. We got a spinach salad also, no added protein. The bill was just under 20 dollars. Not impressed at all. I gave it 2 stars because at least they did a nice job decorating the restaurant."}
{"text":"YUM! They make the pasta for the lasagna fresh and you can really taste the difference. And the sauce is SO good! Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was such an amazing surprise. My beloved is a former Phoencian, and swore by this place. So last week, after turkey and doing anything to avoid both cooking AND leftovers, he sold me on getting take out from this place. Over Federal Pizza and Pomo. I was, to say the least, skeptical.

And dead wrong. Yes, the Thomas Street location is sketchy, and the decor is cheesy. But who cares about looks? What I care about is substance: namely, the crust and the sauce. 

This place has both in spades. We got the Frescolina. Perfect cornicone, great flavor in the crust, which was appropriately thin. The sauce was slightly sweet and deliciously herby with oregano, neither too heavy nor too light, but just right as a contrast to the salty prosciutto, creamy mozz, and biting arugula. 

I would be remiss, however, in not mentioning the antipasto platter, a generous portion of caprese salad, cured artichokes, olives, peppers, eggplant, and prosciutto, which comes with a side of balsamic vinegar that should be generously applied. 

If you, like me, think you've had all the excellent pizza Phoenix has to offer, but haven't been here, you're wrong."}
{"text":"Very good wood fired pizza. Better menu, upscale ambiance than I expected. Very reasonable prices. Great value for the price."}
{"text":"So-so Italian / pizza with decent atmosphere. The patio looks fun, and they have a full bar. I was alone, for some much needed \"me\" time while I waited to pick up my son from the ice rink down the street. 

The service was quite good, except for one glitch at the end. 

The food was not consistent at all. I ordered a salad that advertised fresh tomato and fresh mozzarella. Tomato was even in the name! I expected some lovely version of beautiful rich red tomato slices, with pillowy, glistening slices of mozzarella. Instead, it was a typical romaine salad with arugula mixed in and a sprinkle of diced tomatoes. No mozzarella. It all had a sickly parlor to it. I asked about the mozzarella and a waiter had to look at the menu to confirm my claim that there should be cheese. He dashed in and out of the kitchen, returning with a dish of hastily sliced chunks of rather firm, almost gluey cheese. 

The cappuccino I ordered had no froth - just heavy cream. It was a generous cup, and my young waiter proudly informed me he made it himself. Cute, but a barista he is not. 

I ordered a calzone to take home, which they forgot about and hastily fired. My husband reports that while slightly undercooked, it was still tasty. 

I would give it a two, but the service itself was attentive and fixed issues quickly, as best they could. And the Italian ladies next to me who had pizza raved about it, so perhaps the flaw was in my selections. That said, they ordered a veggie pizza and a key veggie had been left off, but they didn't seem to mind. Perhaps the wine is just. That. Good. 

Give it a try, but set expectations low."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place, we had never been there before. That was a mistake! If I could give a negative stars I would.  We also had a coupon from the 2018 Entertainment Book Mobile App for a buy one get one entrée. It was my husband, myself, our 7 year old and our 9 month old. It was 6pm on Friday night (1/5/18) and the place was empty, besides us there was only one other table.  We get seated and we are told our waitress will be here shortly, then we wait and wait and wait.  The hostess comes over with water and bread because the server never came to the table.  I asked about the coupon and what do they consider entree's so we knew what we should be ordering.  The hostess says she has only been here a few days and has not had coupons from the Entertainment App before. She goes and asks what we believe to be our actual waitress about the coupon.

The hostess comes back and says they are not accepting coupons at this time.  We asked why?  Its from the 2018 Entertainment App and its only the first week into 2018.  She said she didn't know and she can ask the owner and we said yes please.  She goes over to a man who was sitting 2 tables away from us and we are sure heard the entire conversation.  They were not talking in English so we could not understand what they were saying.  Mind you we still have not seen a waitress.

The hostess comes back and says we are not accepting coupons at this time, we again asked why?  She did not have an answer.  She then says that for the inconvenience the owner would buy our pizza for us.  We said then fine we would get a pizza and salad and our 7 year old was getting a kids cheese pizza.  The hostess then says its the kids pizza that will be free.  What???  Your meals are $20 and your going to comp a $6.50 pizza because you are choosing not to accept coupons that you placed to bring people into your business.  

On a Friday night your restaurant was empty and you are turning away business!  We got up and left!!  One would think the owner would come over and try to explain or apologize, nothing! Do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"So Boyfriend's birthday rolls around and it becomes a challenge - with every restaurant he chooses is closed on Mondays . . . a grim evening seemed to be ahead. 

Alas Yelp to the rescue - \"How about here . . . they have tiramisu\" . . . \"Um ok\" he responds. (ok this isn't exactly how the conversation goes, but you get the point). 

We pull in . . . a little nervous - next to a sketchy Circle K - Really? we both think 

This small (less than 10 tables, and only 3 that have four seats) Italian place made our night. First the food is really fantastic - clean, not over done, and fresh. I had gnocchi - this was the real stuff.  He had lasagna - it made his night - filling a void for a lasagna that he had in Italy (the closest other option is in Seattle - not so feasible!).  The sauce was really great fresh - rustic - tomato sauce.  Also - the bread starter has us wanting to back for pizza - so tasty! 

The service was great and personal (nothing like the owner telling you the background of the restaurant) 

Also - the owner was truly gracious and kind to his hard working staff. Gabriel (the lead chef/waiter/server) seemed to put his heart into service. When he learned it was BF's Birthday he took back the check (even as we said it was not necessary) and removed BF's dessert from the bill. 

This restaurant deserves support and patronage - it is truly fantastic. 

Put the sketchy Circe K aside."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and I'm greatly impressed. Really impressed. More impressed than I would have imagined that I'd be.

My first impression when we walked in was:  \"Hey, this is a nice little restaurant!\". It has a nice ambience, and just feels like a warm place to share a meal. We sat out on the patio, and took a look at the menu. Their menu actually makes a really nice first impression, because they have a number of items on there that you won't find at your typical XYZ Italian restaurant. Lots of seafood offerings always gets a big thumbsup from me, and this place doesn't disappoint. We decided to get two pizzas and a pasta dish. Both pizzas were top-notch, and the cannelloni was delicious. Their pink vodka sauce is light but flavorful, and the crust of the pizzas was wood-fired perfection. Everyone on staff was really friendly, and I really appreciated the story of how the restaurant came to be and how the owner was staying true to the original vision of the founder. 

My girlfriend and I came here again today, and we had a terrific lunch!!! We decided to try something a little different, and opted for two pasta dishes with a fresh calamari appetizer. I won't mince words here- we were absolutely blown away by the food. The fresh calamari has a slightly spicy red sauce, which put huge smiles on both of our faces. You know it's true love when we both exchanged a silent look with each other, trying to figure out exactly *HOW* embarrassed the other would be if we had raised the  plate to our lips and slurped down the remainder of the sauce. Then the pasta came out and our smiles got even bigger. I had the gnocchi (which I believe they make fresh at the restaurant?) and she had the rigatoni. Both were fantastic, and it was only by a phenomenal act of self-control that we had some to take home.

Now, I'm hooked. I want to come back here and try all of their dishes. Weekly. This place is now one of our top contenders for date-night, so we'll definitely be around."}
{"text":"The best. Hands down. 

Found the place by accident. The strip mall is crazy but the food is AMAZING! You'll never waste your time looking for a great Italian place ever again!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN ALL OF PHOENIX!

Seriously, we've tried so many pizza restaurants in Phoenix and this \"hole-in-the-wall\" place is hands down the best one.

We came at around 3 for a late lunch so the place was empty. It is small inside so if you come during dinner, it might be packed. But if you have to wait, it is definitely worth the wait.

We had the calamari for appetizers. It was a tad too salty- but not enough to turn you off. The sauce was divine!

The pizza was incredible. The sauce was just immaculate!!!!! What I really look for in a great pizza is the crust. Toppings, sauce, all that is easy to distinguish. But you can tell if someone really puts thought in the crust - it's what makes a pizza stand out from all the rest. Like good sushi rice, y'know? The crust at Pizza a Metro makes their pizza stand out like a winner!

So, so good! You won't regret coming here. I'd come back to Phoenix just for this pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on our experience this evening. It would have been our third time eating here....but it will most likely be our last attempt 

The restaurant is supposed to be open until midnight. My husband, son and I walked in around 9:30 to get a bite to eat. We were totally ignored for a few minutes, despite some guy being at the host stand. A sour, snotty little girl with curly hair came out of the back, saw us, and dropped her shoulders in a visible display of disgust and exasperation. She huffed back into the back and then stomped up to where we were waiting and hissed \"three???\" And rolled her eyes...no smile, no greeting, just outright hostility and annoyance at the sight of customers. She grabbed three menus and tossed them onto a table then stomped away. Absolutely the worst service I have ever received!!!!! Deserving of zero stars. We just walked out, not that anyone in there have a damn. It was like we walked in to a private party uninvited. 
It's a shame, because the food was delicious the other two times we ate here, but the service always ranges from indifference to confusion to loathing. Horrible to the Nth power."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the door steer you aways from amazing food. This place serves some amazing pizza and pasta. The staff is really friendly and once inside the atmosphere makes you forget the area around you."}
{"text":"Fantastic calamari and the pizzas were really tasty. Pizza Metro is right around the corner from our new home so this will become a regular spot for Italian."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times but it has been awhile.  NOW IT IS FANTASTIC!  The chef Alex is wonderful and will make anything you ask for!  We asked for a Caesar salad (not on menu) and he personally made us each one and brought it to us AND it was the best I have ever had. 
Pizza fantastic.  Wed night if you order a 16 inch then you get a 12 inch for free.

Our new favorite place.  Atmosphere is romantic and cozy.  Nice back patio too.
Ask to talk to the Chef.  He has such joy in his heart and is wonderful to talk to.   
Gilbert needs to try this place.  If you have tried it before....I rec going back.  Totally different experience and loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"Ok. Try the happy hour clams with sausage and put the sauce on the other HH item fried zucchini.  The combo is really good."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and got right in on a Saturday night (around 5:30). They accommodated our large party quickly and the prices were exceptional. They had live music there too that added to the nice ambience. Good for date night, family night or large celebrations. I would highly recommend this place and will be going back there again soon."}
{"text":"Coming from a chef, I must say that Alex turns out some really good Italian dishes. From the bread and garlic butter to the Tiramisu and everything in between, his attention to detail, technique, and seasoning is right on. I had the smoked chicken rigatoni and if my wife let me I would have licked the plate, instead I used more of his amazing bread to clean it up! The other people in my party had the pizza, the Metro steak and pasta, and spinach cannelloni, all of which looked and tasted great!

A stand by my choice to never judge a restaurant by service alone, nor to knock a place down to 4 stars for less than 5 star service. We go to places to eat good food, 5 star service to me is just an added bonus, or even 4 stars for that matter. If I did have to give a rating for service, I would give them 5 stars for doing their best given the situation. Dealing with restaurant customers sucks! making a bad situation worse just makes it worse for everyone. With that said, keep an open mind when you go and be patient... it's worth it!"}
{"text":"So my friends and I wanted pizza OMG this place hands down has the best pizza we got the huge pizza 3 different flavors all were good.  I never could think that broccoli on a pizza would be so good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix. We come here to order for our holiday parties, and the food is amazing. The owner is very helpful."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday January 30 for dinner.  Was seated pretty quickly however noticing people complaining about not getting there food or not getting their order taken.  We sat for almost 30 minutes and not even got a water.  There was a couple sitting next to us and I overheard the gentleman tell the very young waitress that while he is finished  with his meal his wife never got her meal.  The waitress responded with oh what did she even order.  At that point I decided to leave since it was late and my daughter was really hungry.  The staff seemed like they were all high school age and the man working the bar was rude."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was friendly and prompt and the price was right. What else do you need to know?"}
{"text":"Great place. Looking forward to my next meal there. Friendly service and a great menu"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here for a late lunch. We were the only ones here. We ordered the caprese salad and a pizza with half margherita pizza and the other half capricciosa. The salad was good and the margherita pizza was good. The capricciosa was fair. The service was great. The waiter was attentive but not overbearing."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I dined at Pizza A Metro for lunch. We selected the place purely on Yelp reviews, and when we pulled up to the little hole in the wall, I'll admit we were a little apprehensive. The restaurant is tiny, but clean. The wait staff was very accommodating, pushing many of their tables together for our party of ten.

We ordered and promptly received our food. Wood-fired pizzas, side salads, and calamari. All of the food was incredible. I cannot stress how amazing all the food was. We tried the sausage and broccoli, the prosciutto and arugula, the meatball, and the veggie. All were perfect. I didn't partake in the calamari, but everyone else said it was great. The bread and olive tapenade and the side salads were also delish.

After our dinner, the waiter gave us three complimentary slides of cheesecake (it was one of my coworker's birthday) and handles split checks no problem. Top it all off, everything was such a great value. Lots of food for the price.

I will definitely be back, especially since I hear they make all their pastas from scratch. That vodka sauce is calling my name."}
{"text":"Great food some of the best pizza and pasta I've ever had. Looks definitely are deceiving with this one! I'm glad I did not judge the book by the cover!"}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes, it wasn't my favorite. (I'd say the best part was the crust) as far as service goes, it was excellent. We were seated quickly, our drinks were never low, the food was prepared quickly, and our server was professional. As of our visit, this restaurant is only 7 months old, but I'm not sure it will make it past a year and a half. The reason we were seated so quickly was because there was no line and only about 4-5 other tables dining. Yes, it was a Thursday night and only 7:30, but simply due to the taste of the pizza for the price, I would not return. We spent $30 (tip inclusive) on a Cesar salad and half chicken pesto/half BBQ chicken regular pizza, no drinks, no dessert."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time here. The place is small. I was immediately impressed when I saw the wood-fired pizza oven. The owner served us personally and couldn't have been nicer. We had a pizza with mozzarella, meatballs, and sausage. The pizza had really excellent flavor, and I was very impressed with the quality of the meatballs. The little char on the crust from the wood oven was magical. 

My only complaint is that we didn't leave totally stuffed. We got the 2nd largest pizza, but the pizza is so flat that it isn't too filling. The other dishes and appetizers were really expensive, so we didn't get anything else. We aren't competitive eaters or anything, we just like to be full and have some leftovers. Am I greedy? Maybe. 

It was delicious, so we would definitely go back. Next time, we'll get two, smaller pizzas. That would be good."}
{"text":"So, my friend Angie and I were looking for a casual place to dine on Saturday night, and I suggested we try Pizza a Metro.  I've seen that a lot of fellow Yelpers have gone here, and its recieved quite a few reviews.  

So, I call the place to confirm where they are located, and what time they are open until.  A nice gentleman with an Italian accent answered the phone, and was so friendly and helpful!  I loved it!  

So, I drive there, and like the gentleman said, he was right off the expressway next to a circle K.  What shocked me at first was a few things.  First, its a tiny little parking lot, and its shared with a circle K.  I found this interesting.  Fortunately, there was parking available, so I waited for my friend to arrive.  The second surprise that I had was just how small this place was.  Interesting.  I guess if you had a larger party (more then 4 people) you would definately NEED to call in a reservation, as its a very limited seating arrangement.

When my friend finally arrived, all the seats were taken, and I was greeted by the gentleman with the thick Italian accent.  He told me that it would be about a 7 minute wait, so my friend and I waited outside in the parking lot.   The wait ended up being more about 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops.  Not bad.

When we were seated, we really liked the place.  Theres a firebrick oven where people were cooking pizzas.  There was also other workers that you could see preparing other foods.  Somewhat of an open kitchen feel.  the service was great.  I believe this place is owned and operated by this Italian family.  they most be brothers, because periodically throughout the evening, they were speaking in Italian to each other.  I think it really added to the evening, and made the place feel much more authentic.

We ended up ordering our food, and even tho I was not extremely hungry, my friend was.   I went with a Cesar Salad, and my friend went with the Cheese Ravioli.  We were given some complimentary appitizers which were bread chunks and red sauce. Tasty!  We both ordered pops, which were brought out and poured for us...but they were from those 20 ounce pop bottles that you would get at a local store...not from a fountian. I found this interesting.

Angie really enjoyed her Ravioli, but I felt like my salad was a little soggy.  Sitll edable, just a little to much dressing.  The food here seems to be good, and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile.  I would bring friends or family here who are in from out of town, becuase I think its one of those more authentic experiences.

Anyways, the service was wonderful.  Truely a gem, and much more fun and authentic then most places I have been for pizza and pasta lately."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The food is tastefully prepared, service is unbeatable, they make you feel like family. I am a big fan of sea food and let me tell you this place has the best seafood dishes, ask their Chef for days special! Ahh the Wood Oven Pizza... Perfectly crispy, cheesy, just delicious must try! Prices are very economical. Definitely coming back here with my family and friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Pizzas are just delicious and the sauce yum!..... We eat here at least once a week and love it! Great service, spotless clean, and most importantly great ingredients. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here for lunch and it was delicious!  I never would have tried this place without a friend recommending it, and I am happy they did. 

I had the spaghetti carbonara.  It was absolutely divine."}
{"text":"There's a bit of history with me and this place. Many moons ago, my family was super close to the former owners of this place when it was called Romans pizza. Then my brother and his best friend bought it from them and ran it...to the ground. And that's probably the best thing that ever happened to this place because luckily after that, Pizza A Metro happened. 

I always passed by this place but I never bothered to stop because the area really creeps me out. Well, after seeing a bunch of my yelp friends check in to here and reading the reviews, I finally decided it was time. 

This place is a poster child for \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" because that's what I did and I missed out. When I walked in, it's tiny. But it gives you a warm feeling. I don't know what it is about it. I got the to-go menu and they had their lunch menu which was incredibly cheap! 

I ordered the small margherita pizza. I asked the girl how small is the small and she told me 12 inches...here I am thinking 8 inches. And it was only $7.95! What a deal! I was stuck between the tirimisu and the creme brûlée. I love both desserts and I love homemade tirimisu even more but the creme brûlée won. I had my dessert before my pizza since I had to wait til it was cooked. The creme brûlée was excellent! It was perfectly creamy and the perfect amount of vanilla flavor.
My pizza was ready and I took it with me...I don't usually like to eat in my car but I DEVOURED this pizza before I even made it to school. It wasn't overly salty, had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. I wish it had more basil but it didn't ruin it. Overall, I was satisfied! 

I will definitely be back to try the pastas and the tirimisu!"}
{"text":"I had a really hard time deciding between 4 and 5 and I decided to go with 5 because for the first time in my life, I ate my leftovers  :)

First of all, this place is completely unexpected. Being next to a ghetto Circle K in a not-so-good part of town, I was not expecting the high quality of food and service that we received. Needless to say, I was really impressed.

We started with the Margharita pizza and I must say, I have not had better. That is surprising because I ate pizza twice in New York in August.  For my entree I had the spaghetti pomodoro. Normally I prefer a capellini pasta with this type of sauce, but I was really impressed. Honestly, I wanted to just sit and smell it all night long!

We were so stuffed after the pizza/entree, but Michael insisted (heavily) that we try the tiramisu. It was DIVINE! Normally I would be angry at a server for forcing me to order something I didn't want, but I will excuse him this time.

I really like how proud they are that they make everything from scratch, fresh. Even the desserts. I am also excited that they are opening up an additional location in Scottsdale!

On a side note, they have REALLY cute plates and bowls!!  :) 

I cannot believe it took me this long to get to Pizza A Metro, especially since it is the first place I ever bookmarked on Yelp!

I will be back. Many, many times!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the only person sitting in this restaurant at 12:30 PM on a weekday. After reading the amazing reviews I feared I wouldn't be able to get a table.  The fettuccine primavera with tomato vodka cream sauce was exceptional. Can't wait to try the pizza next. This place really is a little gem."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit and once again, fantastic service, delicious food! Chicken Pesto Pizza was so good. Our server was very knowledgeable about their wine selection and recommended a bottle to us that we really enjoyed. There was a small mixup with our order but they made it right. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing, cant beat the high heat signature pizza oven, house salad has flavorful balsamic vinaigrette. Very nice staff. Prices were pretty good too."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this little place. The pizza is amazing. The staff was super friendly and made it a great first time experience. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great crust, sauce and cheese. Service was good, but it had to be because this place is f'ing tiny so we sat next to the kitchen door and they had to walk by us every 30 seconds.

The parts I didn't care for.

---No booze, sure you could BYOB, but that's a hassle sometime.
---This place has maybe 6 tables, 2 parking spaces, and located next to an oh so romantic Circle K.
---We were brought the wrong pizza, (which I started to eat before I noticed) it had sausage and broccoli.  Flavor was good but there was water, NOT OIL, in the center of the pizza.  Obviously the center crust sucked but the rest was very good.
---Had some chicken special thingy, good but not 5 star Yelp good.
---The Cappricosa (sp?) pizza we ordered arrived it had canned black olives on it, out of the jar artichokes, and basic cubed ham on it. Oh yes, there was water in the center of it too. WTF?

We were given a piece of tarimusu because of the mix up, which was great. Thank you.

Some of the items I saw come from the kitchen looked really good so I'd go back and maybe get take out or stop in for lunch.

So better than average food, but not the best ever.   

The location sucks, there is no ambiance at all, and no booze.

Three stars from me.   I guess I'm a Cibo kind of guy."}
{"text":"It was average... Now I'm not Italian or anything, nor do I ever intend to be, but in my humble ignorant American opinion it was as we say here \"meh\".

First, be careful about the size of your party. Ours was a party of 6, they were basically empty and it took a while for them to set the table up. Party of 4 or less is the way to go here.

Their calamari was delicious. It took a while for it to come out, but it came out hot and tasty. Best thing I ate here.

I would strongly recommend against their Pollo a Marsala. It was average. Nothing special. Their pizza was decent enough. Again nothing special. I imagine most of those who have left overly positive comments about the pizza haven't had great pizza before.

My wife asked for a straw at the beginning of our meal and the server got caught up in a conversation and had completely forgot about the straw. To be fair it may have been such a good conversation that my wife's straw wasn't the least bit important, I'll be fair about it. I mean she is pregnant and high maintenance I guess. It's whatevs.

Check it out if you want. New places can be fun... I've never been to prison... maybe that'd be interesting?"}
{"text":"This is one of the most horrible and expensive place I've been to. I went there once and I immediately know that I will not be there again.

This place is expensive. A price for one pizza in this place, I can almost get three in Pizza Hut or other pizza restaurant and it's even better. It's funny how it says Meatballs Pizza, I thought there are going to be meatballs in the pizza and that is why it cost about 20 bucks. I was wrong. The pizza was not even that big for the price it cost us and the meatballs were cut into the slice like pepperoni.

The waiting also even worse. I waited for about almost 20 minutes until the the pizza is ready.

I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Believe every good review you read. I can't speak for the pizza, but the pasta dishes we've gotten from here have been top notch. 

Don't judge the book by its cover. It's a true ma and pa operation, so it doesn't look like much. The location isn't impressive. If you're looking for swank or glitzy, this isn't for you. You won't find a cluster of hipsters or scenesters trying to feel important. 

What you will find is amazing food. It's worth going out of your way to try it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The worst service- sat down and no one came around for 10 minutes to ask just for our drinks.  Ten minutes later we are still waiting for our water ...... then we ordered the chopped salad and they came back w the  ITALIAN salad???? The. After we pointed that out and excused their mixup we ordered a veggie pizza and a MEAT pizza came out.   Is anyone alive in that flesh covered skeleton?   Lastly our two beers we ordered we EXPIRED! Never go here!   Worst restive aunt in the entire EAST VALLEY"}
{"text":"I can't give a review for the food, since we were never served. Actually, after waiting for over 20 minutes without having our order taken, we left. But before that, our waitress took our drink order (there is ONE Italian wine on the menu). Came back to tell us they didn't have it. Ordered another and she came back to tell us she didn't have that either. So I asked what they DID have and we ordered that. She said she'd be back to take our order. That's when she never returned. She did visit the table behind us THREE times. This place was not crowded, there were 3 servers and 4 tables on the patio. No excuse. We left some cash to pay for our barely-touched wine and left. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Love the pizza, love the pasta, love the atmosphere, love it! The owner is very friendly and greats everyone who comes in. All the pasta is rolled by hand, this is something you do not always find at Italian restaurants. This is a difference in taste and texture between handmade pasta and prepackaged. Tiramisu is to-die-for. The only downside is that you might have to wait for awhile because there is limited seating."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Great little intimate place with a casual atmosphere. Yes, it's on the border of a shady area in-town but have never had any problems. Food is very good and service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been here 3 times now in the past 5 weeks.  Just moved to the neighborhood recently and I want to LOVE this place so BAD, because we can easily walk there in a little under 10 minutes.  Sadly though, its iffy at best.  I almost gave 3 stars, based on the ONE good dish I had, but cannot in good conscience and here is why.  This is a PIZZA place according to the name.  BUT....first time we did order the pizza.  They are thin crust pizzas, and yet the crust was soggy and soft on the bottom, very clear that they put everything on the pizza BEFORE putting it in the oven.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BAKE JUST THE CRUST ONLY on its own for a few minutes so it crispens, that way you can add sauce, a GOOD amount, then toppings, and cook it all together longer, and it will turn out fine.  That was the other problem too....hardly any sauce or toppings.  Worst pizza I ever had, nothing to it, and little flavor.  Disappointed.  BUT, on visit 2, we ordered pasta and a sandwich.  BOTH were really good, my hubby's sandwich a solid 8, to 8.5, meatball sub with tasty peppers added.  I got linguine with red clam sauce.  I also rate this an 8 for flavor, and a good portion.  Not the best I've ever had, but very good and surprising after the pizza experience.  And also on that visit, another guest ordered a pizza that was made by someone different than who had made ours, and THEIR pizza looked AWESOME compared to what we got.  Appeared to be MUCH more toppings and possibly crispier but that is hard to tell just by looking.  So we thought, hmmm, maybe he is the one who has gotten most of the good reviews about the pizza.  On visit 3, hubby ordered the sandwich again since it was so good.  I ordered a SPECIAL, I find MUCH more often than not, specials are usually tasty at places, but this one was meh.  Was supposed to be Cajun shrimp pasta, I guess because it had a little bit of what I am almost certain was paprika, sprinkled on top, it makes it Cajun? Lol, other than that just a bland, non spicy cream sauce (vodka sauce).  It tasted, fine, a few of the noodles were still too crunchy.  I rate it a 6.  Cant say I hated it, just expected more flavor, and I kind of thought it would have more to it, a few more ingredients, than JUST the sauce, shrimp, noodles, and paprika.  Also, I ordered wine with this last meal, and my waiter forgot to get it for me, but here is the other thing.  This time, like the other 2 times, we were one of the only couples here!  So if you aren't busy at all, and you even personally hand me the wine list yourself and I order, along with just 2 other entrees, Im not sure how that slips your mind lol.  Anyhoo.....and none of the times we were there did we receive AMAZING service or anything, just basic.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing to tip high about either.  So lesson learned.  Its only ok.  BUT, I might come back for that sandwich for lunch occasionally.  But not planning to dine here as a couple for dinner again, unless we see a turn around in the reviews.  So far, I suspect either all the good reviews were for the staff we saw there on our second visit, which was a SAT, and that particular pizza chef, OR, they are friends of the owner.  I responsibly visit a place more than once before reviewing for a reason, I am fair."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked this pizza. We thought it was a great blend between American and Italian styles. The wood oven is great as always, and the crust flavor is good."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate to see this restaurant fall so far. First the service declined, then the quality of food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. You want to eat hear, it is next to a Circle K. Give it a shot or grab takeout at the least."}
{"text":"We had good service however the pizza had absolutely no flavor.  I would not consider dining there again in the future
I was quite frankly surprised. The salad was much better than the pizza. I Would say by a landslide.  there is never much traffic in there, I see why now."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here and it was reasonably priced and not exactly ordinary.  Pasta dishes made with care and small twists on recipes, and the pizzas are fired in a brick-lookin oven of some sort.  I couldn't get enough of my caesar.  I got the chicken dish of the day, and it was clever, saucy and delicate--I recall mushrooms and artichoke hearts, but it's been a few months so I don't recall what it was called.

Not the place to take a snooty date, as it's in a nondescript strip mall.  But once you're inside it's almost charming, and the food is really good, I'd say.   The owners/managers were super friendly, which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Food was great, not sure about all of the negative reviews regarding service but ours was great for a Thursday night. Yes we had a coupon that they said they would not honor but they gave us a 12.00 discount then 4 complementary drink cards and the owner baked a loaf of bread for my wife to take home.  While leaving the waiter chased us down in the parking lot to get our name and number saying if they get the coupon problem figured out we could come back and use the coupon."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was a bad experience. I ordered 2 pizzas for take out. I was told it would take 40 min. Showed up right on time and the place was completely empty at 6pm. Prob not a good sign. I was greeted warmly, but the woman said, I was wondering if you were going to come soon, before your pizza gets cold! Ummm yeah, I showed up when I was told. Took pizza home- the dough was completely undercooked on both pizzas- badly. The top was completely done, but we had to put both pizzas in the oven to make them edible. After that, the toppings were now over cooked and it sucked. Would have been nice if someone checked the pizza before putting it in a box."}
{"text":"I actually had the worst alfredo sauce of my life. I ordered angel hair alfredo and the sauce was terrible; they forgot the shrimp and my wife's pizza was just very mediocre. The server was trying but man oh man she just didn't get it."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great night.  We got the calamari (lightly battered with delish marinara), gnocchi in vodka sauce (perfectly cooked and OMG delicious), bolognese pizza (absolutely fantastic!) - everything was GREAT, with attentive and friendly wait-staff.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, calamari, bruschetta. Have gone here multiple times and each time it's consistently amazing food. Great service, great prices, quality food, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Italian was my unofficial and official second major in college. I studied in Rome for three months and Florence for three months and went back several times after to experience the magic all over again. While I was there, I learned many things about Italian culture and solidified my language skills, but as you can imagine, the thing that I found the most exciting and educational was the Italians' relationship with food.  

Regardless of the region I was in, I found Italians united by shared beliefs about food preparation and eating, many of which were foreign to me prior to going. As an example, all the Italians I met took it as a given that: salad comes after a meal, not before it; fresh fruit is a dessert, not a snack or breakfast; alfredo sauce and mozzarella sticks are not Italian; alcohol exists to enhance the flavors of food, not to get drunk; and pepperoni is not thin slices of cured pork, but peppers - you know, the vegetables (this one blew my mind the most!). 

You get the idea. Of course, these guidelines come across to Americans as strict rules. We love our culinary freedom, and that makes sense - we have many different types of food, types of people, and types of lifestyles. Plus, Italian food changed a lot at the hands of the immigrants who came here. However, even if I'm not going to follow every guideline, I took from my experiences in Italy a sense of genuine appreciation for simple, fresh flavors, a desire to slow down and truly enjoy what I'm eating, and a greater awareness of the way that different dietary components come together to create a balanced diet and better internal functioning.

Since I got back, I've found few Italian restaurants that really embody these key principles, refusing to dumb down or speed up their food for the American masses. Well, Pizza A Metro is part of that elite category, and I'm thrilled to have found it here in Phoenix, just a short drive from our house. Maurizio makes it his goal to serve his customers fresh, simple, carefully-prepared food that allows the flavors of individual ingredients to shine. I appreciate that so much. 

We checked the place out for the first time last Friday night. We had made a reservation in advance, which was a great idea because we only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated once we arrived. We were promptly greeted by Maurizio and quickly had our drink order taken by the server. I was a little nervous about speaking Italian, since I'm pretty rusty, but I figured I should, since I haven't got many chances to do so in California, where I grew up, or here in Phoenix. So, when Maurizio returned with our bread basket and to take our order, I worked up my courage and ordered in Italian. Even though he was super-busy, Maurizio asked me a few questions back in Italian (where did I study, etc.) and continued to converse with us in Italian throughout the rest of the meal. It was so much fun for me to speak again, especially when the food was so delicious and really took me back to my study abroad time. 

We decided to start with the grilled calamari and then have the Penne Amatriciana and a medium Pizza Frescolina. The bread basket was phenomenal, with lightly oiled pieces of Italian flatbread with a cold mixture of eggplant, olives, and onions (almost like an Italian ratatouille). When the calamari arrived, we discovered that it was fried and not grilled (both are appetizer options; grilled is more prominent in Italy), but we decided not to say anything and eat it anyway. We were glad we did because it reminded me of the seafood \"fritti misti\" you get in Italy - just lightly battered with a hint of seasoning. It came with a tomato sauce, but it was delicious with just a squeeze of lemon. 

Our entrees were even more delicious. My pasta could have been a bit more al dente, probably because most Americans don't eat it that way, but no harm done - I'll just order it that way next time. The sauce was incredible and truly authentic. It perfectly combined fresh tomatoes, tender pieces of pancetta, onion, garlic, and olive oil without being too thick or sweet. The pizza was also to die-for with a thin, flour-brushed crust, small amounts of milky mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and arugula, and salty prosciutto. Just like Italian pies, all the flavors were balanced and no single one was overwhelming. So you know, the medium was huge and even with our huge appetite we ended up taking 3-4 slices home.

All in all, we only spent $30 or so and had an amazing, deeply satisfying meal that brought me back to my memorable time in Italy. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more things (and practice my Italian again!)."}
{"text":"Best place to eat pizza in gilbert. Wood fire pizza is fantastic and very affordable. Manager Margarita is very friendly and helpful. Bar is classy and welcoming."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how fast I wanted to get to my pc and write this review.  I'm still a new yelper, and have my list of reviews I need to write, but this was a priority.

My dearest friend suggested we do lunch here.  She had warned me about the neighborhood.  I'm not a snob, and have eaten at various questionable locales, but I have to admit, this made me raise an eyebrow.  Had anyone else recommended it, I would have kept on driving.

It's tucked away in that corner in Circle K.  Just pull in the Circle K parking lot, give it a minute, parking will free up, trust me, it's WORTH IT. 

Yes it's tiny, about 4 tables, that seat about 4 people each.   Very clean, you are pleasantly surprised to walk inside.  You are greeted by Chef/Owner/Waiter - he is amazing.  I didn't catch his name, but he's it, with a few others in the kitchen - which is at full view.    He's pleasant, and makes you feel like he's known you for years.

I couldn't decide on the menu.  I have not found any gnocci that is decent at restaruants, so when I saw it on the menu it is where I gravitated.  My mistake was turning the menu around (2 sided) because not only did my 5 can't decide items on the front, I now had more on the back.   Then our kind host offers up specials!!   I left it to chef's suggestion, by offering up the gnocci and linguine.  He suggested the gnocci, with choice of sauces and he suggested the pink - which is the vodka sauce.    OH  MY GOODNESS!!!  The portion was a dinner size portion (this was lunch time).   I pierced one of the gnocci's with my fork, and it didn't resist.  I tested another one, and again, perfection, like stabbing mash potatoes - no resistance.  Then the taste - WOW.  They were like tiny silk pillows in your mouth.  The vodka sauce had a very meaty flavor for a meatless sauce, I was surprised that my plate was completely clean and I didn't even use their incredible bread to mop up the sauce on the plate, just the pillows of gnocci.  

Service was great, by mid meal the place was full, and he took care of everyone, ensuring ice teas were refilled, he even had a delivery - said he'd be right back, and drove off.  (Kitchen help remained - who ensured again ice teas were topped off).  

When we departed, we saw him in the kitchen, busy, so didn't say goodbye, but he came out, and thanked us while we walked the mini mall parking lot to our car.     

I wish I was in the delivery area - but then again, I really don't need to gain any more weight!!   I'll be back, and I sure hope word catches on about this place!"}
{"text":"Service is very thorough. If people complain about it being slow, I would say that's only because they try hard to get things right. The cook came out and personally check on how we liked our food. I think a key might be to try this place when they aren't slammed because the food is great and the service we had was 5 stars for sure. The pizza is so good. The pasta was excellent. Everything is just do well done."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here tonight! The food was delicious and service was right on cue! We will definitely be back with friends! Thank you, we left stuffed with amazing food! :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to downgrade Pizza A Metro after my last visit. It's still one of the best pizzas in town, and the service is still good, but they took away the amazing bread and tapenade they used to give out before the meal. They also raised their prices substantially. The Capriccosa pizza is now $17.95 instead of $14.95 so I still like the place, but five stars is not for a place thats just really good."}
{"text":"Wow !!!!!  Pizza A Metro is absolutely delicious ... I was staying at the Hilton in Gilbert  and looking for a place to eat I stumbled on to this gem. I had the Rose Marie cheese ravioli and it was so amazing. 

I'll I can say where ever you are in Phoenix you must stop by this restaurant and try there dishes."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Super small tho! We had a large group of 10 and took up over half the seating.  They were happy to accommodate and very friendly.  The food was awesome although I felt like all of it could have used more seasoning."}
{"text":"What a charming and unexpected dinner experience! The food is incredible in this tucked away little restaurant. I was most impressed with the pizza and pasta was delicious too! I will keep frequenting this place to be sure!"}
{"text":"My family and were looking for a new spot to try for pizza.  We have driven by the place before, but never stopped to check it out.  So, we took a chance today and glad we did!

The variety of food here was great!  The pizza was really good and so was the meatball panini.  You must try the caprese burger!  Yum!  We ordered chicken tenders for the kids, but these were on a whole new level.  They were lightly breaded and tasty!  The kids loved it!  The chocolate cake and tiramisu were wonderful as well.  

The ambience was inviting and the bar is stocked very well.  My wife and I are going to try the happy hour soon as it sounds pretty fantastic.  Small plates and beverages are the way to go.  

I've heard the impression of this place was marginal before, but there is fresh talent trying to revamp and rejuvenate the menu and overall dining experience.  So, give this place a try.  We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This little tiny restaurant (which I NEVER knew was there!!) is definitely tied for the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. The penne alla vodka was amazing as well. Two small pizzas and two pasta dishes filled up the 4 of us to the brim! 

Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, amazing food and excellent, friendly service...I'll definitely be bringing my family here the next time they visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome and the interior was classy for as small of a place it is. The server was very friendly. I don't recommend bringing kids with as the place echos and of course kids can be kind of loud.  I wouldn't recommend hanging around after to have a cig as a pan handler may come around and ask for money.... Other than that, great authentic pizza and worth ordering take out!!"}
{"text":"This is a charming little local neighborhood find. It has nice decor and ombiance. The staff is always accommodating and friendly. Oh and it has wonderful food. You try it once, I'm sure you will be back."}
{"text":"When my family and I first walked in there were two hispanic females chatting and I had to politely interrupt to get seated. One of theise women happen to be our waitress, never quite got a name due to lack of proper introduction. As my family and I sat down we had a few questions on the menu, when we asked our waitress seemed to not be very familiar with their own menu. She could never tell my family and I what multiple menu items consisted of. Once we placed our order our waitress brought out half of our food out and 20minutes later the rest came out. Once we started to eat we noticed our food wasn't up to the prices standards. The pear salad was nothing but vinegar and the fetechinni wasn't anything more then olive oil and heavy whipping cream. As we continued eating we never got waited on until the check. My family and I will definitely not be coming back again. To high of prices, bad quality, not enough menu choices,and bad service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Both times the food was great. I've had a delicious burger (not a typical Italian entree, I know), pizza, and a pasta dish with clams. All items were very good. The servers were great as well. The wait time between ordering and getting the food was longer than I expected, I think that they only have one person working the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in and ordered a pizza. We honestly didn't have time for a sit down meal, as we were on our way to a party. Benjamin made sure everything was fast, neat, and enjoyable. Awesome to have a server who clearly enjoys being at the restaurant and wants the customers to feel the same. Pizza was fresh. Crust is awesome. Mozzarella was fluffy and wonderful. I don't know if it's an Italian faux-pas but I fold the pizza Brooklyn style. The bread they bring out is tasty. Ask for olive oil and balsamic if you're not in to the garlic butter. Beer from the bar was quick and ice cold. Reasonably priced, oven fired--awesome. This was our second visit and I'm not sure why we waited so long to come in. 

Decor is only lacking subject, in my opinion. But when the food is a home run, it could look like the inside of my garage and I wouldn't care. So no stars subtracted for that.

Server went of his was to make us happy--even apologized for not having mineral water in stock and insisted he'd get my wife a club soda with lime from the bar. 

Skip the crowded, pricier Grimaldies down the street and try Pizza a Metro."}
{"text":"I love this place.  When I did my last review I had only tried their pizza at a friend's house, but since then I've been a couple times and had the takeout a few times.  The pizza is delicious!  I really like the pepperoni pizza.  The sauce is simple but just right, the crust is light and chewy, and the mozz is so fresh tasting.  I've also tried plain margherita (cheese), and the sausage, and was happy with those too.

The restaurant itself is very small and has a cozy Italian kitchen vibe (only a few tables for 2, and a couple for parties of 4).  The stone pizza oven is really cool.  The location is kind of random and not in the best area, but it's right off the I-17 and if you park right in front, it's fine.  The owner and other staff are very friendly and accomodating.

I've tried the caesar salad which was great.  The romaine was chopped and crispy and the dressing and croutons were good.  The penne vodka was a big portion and delicious.  Excellent sauce with bits of bacon in it.  It's an artery clogger but so good.  My husband had the chicken parm and he really liked it.  The chicken was pounded out flat, had just the right amount of breading on it, and their sauce is so good it tastes great with everything.  My in-laws had spaghetti with meatballs and really enjoyed it.  My friend has raved about their fresh homemade pastas, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet.  Another plus when you dine in is that they cook up fresh bread in the pizza oven, cut it into small strips, and bring it to the table with a bruschetta style tomato/balsamic dip.  My mouth is watering!

I highly recommend to anyone who loves homestyle classic Italian food and Neapolitan style pizza."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here tonight for a pizza.  Since she's a vegetarian and I'm not, we decided to get half of it as a margarita and half with pepperoni.  

The end result is that the pizza is amazing!  The ingredients tasted very fresh, and they weren't stingy with the fresh mozzarella.  One of the things I really liked was that rather than using tomato slices for the fresh tomato, they used crushed.  It definitely made it harder for me to pull all the cheese off the slice because I didn't bite the whole way through the tomato!

The only downside to the place was that it was small inside.  I wouldn't recommend eating in if you have a large group."}
{"text":"We loved the food and service!! Absolutely fabulously experience!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. I've had a good number of items on the menu and still can't pick a favorite dish. The service is great and the prices are ridiculously reasonable!"}
{"text":"Their food is really really good!!!! Service was great and the owner Alex really knows what he is doing. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered gnocchi with ala vodka sauce. The portion is too big for one person and it would make sense to maybe split an appetizer and the dish. Alternatively, you can take the leftovers home :-) The dish was tasty and I was able to ask for fresh black pepper to add some additional flavor. Gotta have my fresh black pepper! FYI, it would be tough to seat 8 people at this location. The place is small, but the food is grand. Apparently there is a Gilbert location that is bigger. Can't wait to try out that location as well as another entrée."}
{"text":"Got seated on patio then sat there for 10 minutes with absolutely no contact by wait staff yet a guy cleaned nearby tables. We got up & walked out! It is obvious the service is as bad as under the last owners which is too bad b/c we can almost see the plaza from home."}
{"text":"What's not to love about delicious pizza and pasta within biking distance?  Don't let the location fool you, tasty food awaits inside."}
{"text":"If you've ever thought of traveling to northern Italy just to try the food you can save a lot of money by coming to Pizza a Metro.
After living in Italy for 3 years we heard about the food at this restaurant and decided to try it.  Very authentic sauces on the cheese ravioli.  Very authentic pizza.  The crust, the sauce, and the restraint on the use of toppings was exactly the way pizza is prepared in northern Italy.  Of all the pizza we've tried in Phoenix there was no other as close to real northern Italian pizza.

If you don't like the food at Pizza a Metro, don't go to Italy.  if you want an affordable date night , split a saladand a small pizza.  My only complaint is the location .


Question:  has anyone else had their credit card used by others after eating here?  Not accusing, just asking."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Its in a shitty strip mall but reminds me of NJ and some of the great Italian fare found there.  Try the vodka penne!  Its been 3 or 4 years, nice to see much is the same."}
{"text":"Went here per a recommendation and overall it was just okay. I ordered a pizza and salad to go. I ordered half BBQ chicken and half meat lovers and a \"Cajun\" Caesar salad. Not sure what made it \"Cajun\" or double the price of the regular Caesar. Pizza was okay. Felt like the BBQ chicken was missing some toppings. It was literally BBQ chicken and nothing else. I could have sworn the menu mentioned some other things. 
I walked in and sat at the bar to wait for my food. In the time I sat there I felt like I was watching one of those reality shows on tv. They had at least six tables of people and not one person got their food while I was there. They had one server and just seeing the frustration from one guest to another. 

Like I said. Food was decent. Just service needs to improve."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for awhile now, plus, my buddy at work highly recommended it, so I decided to place an order for pickup and drive down here to try it out.  I was glad I did!

I called in my order and went with a small (12 inch) pizza with meatballs and onions (one of my favorite combos when trying a new pizza place).  The guy told me it would be about 15-20 minutes and I arrived with my pizza just about to come out of the oven.  About that.......This place is tiny!  Maybe 4-5 tables and a counter for pickup.  The wood burning oven is front and center.  I like how you can see right into it from the counter.  Pretty cool!  Anyways.....My pizza was done, I paid the man my money, and I was on my way.  I drove a few blocks down, parked in a lot, and decided to go to town.  Here is how it was............

Small Meatball and Onion-  I opened the box and was immediately impressed!  This pizza had fresh mozzarella, extremely thin sliced meatballs, and a some red onions.  They use a crushed tomato sauce and all of this is thrown on top of a thin crust dough.  The pizza is like a hybrid between a Neapolitan style pizza, and a NY thin crust pizza.  A little soft/droopy in the middle, but easily solved once folded in half.  About that dough.....absolutely delicious!  Just enough yeasty tang, and a million little air bubbles made this a perfect dough/crust.  Crispy, chewy, yet light.  Damn fine dough/crust.  Definitely some of the best I have found in AZ.  The toppings were awesome!  I loved the creamy fresh mozzarella, and the super thin meatballs.  They were seasoned well, and I would definitely get them again as a topping.  The red onions totally tied the flavors together, too!  I ate that whole pizza and kind of wished I had ordered the next size up (16 inch)!

Overall, I was VERY impressed!  By looking at the tiny storefront, in its kind of hidden location, you would never think that great pizza would come out of here.  Well...you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't stop in to try a pizza.  It was one of the best pizzas I have had in Phoenix, the guys in the joint were friendly as can be, and I can't wait until I come back for another pizza.  This place rocks!  Easy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great service!. Can't wait to bring the family next time. Beautiful resteraunt."}
{"text":"stopped in Wednesday night on a whim and ordered pizza to go...it was GREAT....the parking lot is not the easiest to get in to but well worth it :)  They brought Bruschetta to snack on while we waited...YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I really wanted to see the metro pizza myself - and oh my goodness! You can watch the person rolling out the dough and turning it into a 39 inch pizza. The pizza was delicious!!! I want another metro pizza! Got the Sausage with Broccoli (the sausage is amazing here - please try), the pizza with the Artichoke, and their Vegetarian pizza. All were delicious! 
They also start of by serving you bruschetta (thumbs up). I ordered a pasta dish with mussel and calamari - sauce was great with a hint of heat. I decided to get dessert to end my meal - Creme Brulee. 
Man, am I stuffed! But the food was fantastic! So glad I finally tried this little gem so I can come back. 
I must add that our server was awesome - super attentive and answered our first timer questions. 
Lastly, the bill arrived with a rose for me - awwww moment and I also got to take the balloon home too! Not only did I fall for their food...now they really captured my heart! I'll be back...count on it for sure!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and we decided to order a pick up one night and try it out. My husband went to pick it up and said he liked the atmosphere and would like to go and eat there if we like the food. I will say both of us loved our dishes!! Even left overs taste as good as they did the first time! We will return. I will say it's a little pricey but the dishes are big and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I went once so far because he said that he went to the Phoenix location and it was really good. The place looked great inside, the server was very nice, and my husband said his pizza was very good. He had a pizza with prosciutto and meatballs, I ordered the vegetarian. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because the veggie pizza had way too many watery veggies on it which caused it to be a very watery pizza. Best part about this place? The kid singing and playing the piano; he played everything from Alicia keys to Elton john. So awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you question \"are we really supposed to be here?!\" But once enter Pizza A, you know you made the right decision.  It is a small venue, maybe seats 40 people tops but is a great place to sit and grab a slice.  My go tos are the meatball pizza and also the pizza with prosciutto and arugula.  The website isn't working night now otherwise I would find the name.

I love that you can get a regular pie or even get \"The Metro,\" a meter of pizza.  Someday I will do something so that I an order a true Metro pizza but until that day. I will just order the regular pie.

If you have a large 6+ part call ahead to make sure they have space because the place is pretty small but they def don't skimp on flavor!"}
{"text":"We really really want to like this place. We have come here about 6 times over the past five to six months. We keep hoping that it will get better. Unfortunately today was a similar experience as our previous visits. Although, it was busier than it has been in the past, the service was extremely slow including just getting water. The salad was served on a warm plate and when the \"french fries\" served with the Panini showed up they had obviously been under a heat lamp for a long time.

Although the waitress was very apologetic, I don't really blame her. The owners obviously have not provided any training in regards to their menu. Including their wine menu. This is the second time that we have had someone wait on us that had no idea what Sauvignon Blanc was or how to open the bottle.

I really hope they can pull it together!  Wishing you the best!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it is so close to my house, but alas, it shall not be. Ok so the ambiance and service were fine. Why only one star? Because I think that the bare minimum that a pizza place should provide is edible pizza. The pizza was simply horrible. To echo the comments of several others, they don't seem to know how to work the oven. The crust was almost raw and the whole pizza was barely warm. I was treating several relatives and was totally embarrassed about the whole thing. Hopefully, they figure out how to run the oven and can turn it around."}
{"text":"We ordered a METRO pizza (just pepperoni and cheese) for pick up.  HILARIOUSLY huge box.  It took up the entire back-seat length of my Honda CRV.  

The pizza was delicious.  I think everything has been said about Pizza A Metro already but it really is some good pizza.  I need to go back and try the pasta now.  It is really small and warm, so I will need to go in the winter when it's cooler.  But I am sure it is worth the heat.

I wanted to save the pizza box and use it to store wrapping paper in it but my husband wouldn't let me.  booo.  It went to the recycle bin."}
{"text":"Really, where else can you go and buy a delicious, thin charred crust, meter long pizza?  

It ranks among the top few pizza places in the valley such as Bianco and Cibo.  

Don't blink driving by or be thrown off by the 7-Eleven adjacent or you will miss it!  

A must try pizza locale for sure!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place daily as it is around the corner from my office. I was stuck alone one day, and was looking for a place that delivered, and remembered this place. So glad I did! I had the meatball pizza. Not sure why, but I did, and I loved it! The ingredients were fresh, and it tasted like pizza is supposed to taste? Yum! Don't let the location scare you (in a small strip center, between a Circle K & apartment complex), I think the delivery guy was the owner...Italian man,,,and very nice! I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"The pizza here was alright nothing special....... I have to say though I was not a fan of the customer service here. They were very slow, and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Found this little pizza place, family owned. 
Delicious pizza, great salad,  everything tasted fresh.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pizza is on point here. Place is literally in a tiny corner and I've passed by so often without stopping . Cutting the story short, took my picky son and daughter to try the small joint and let me say it did not disappoint. The small pizza is pretty damn big and fed the three of us with slices to spare. 

But did I tell you how good the pizza was? Holy wow it was so good even the picky ass kid I have ate and loved it. It might be his new favorite. And mine."}
{"text":"I went here with the BF and a couple of our friends tonight for dinner and it was mighty tasty. I'm very glad I looked at Yelp before going so I knew where this place was because otherwise I would've been very lost. The place is extremely small which makes it slightly uncomfortable (like everyone can hear your conversation and you are sitting very close to other parties) but don't let this scare you off because the food is very good. They give you free bruschetta (essentially) which I thought was the best part of the whole meal....so good! The bread was light and delicious and the topping was vinegary, oniony, and fresh tasting....super yummy. We all kind of shared food, the BF and I got the meatball pizza which was tasty, but a bit heavy on the meatball (can I even say that? ha...) it was thin sliced pieces of meatball on top of a basic cheese pizza. The crust is very good and the sauce is also very fresh tasting. The pizza could have used some basil or something to make it have more depth of flavor, but it was good as is. We also shared the gnocchi which are made in house and were light, airy, and delicious! I love eating places that make their cheese and pasta in house....very cool. Our friends got the penne with vodka sauce which was super bacon -y but good. I couldn't eat a whole plate of it (too heavy) but it is extremely flavorful. They also got a pizza and really enjoyed it. Although I wouldn't say this place is the best pizza in town, it is very good and I would love to eat here again. 

PS: the prices are awesome!!! So many quality ingredients for so little money....excellent!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian place. Service was top notch and food was very good. Had a group of 8 people and 4 were kids. Nice Kids Menu and coloring to keep them occupied until food.  Definitely will be back and everyone should give it a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant has undergone several different owners in the past 6 years. We continue to be disappointed. We thought we would try it again. There were three people sitting at the bar having drinks and appetizers. Our party of four were the only other patrons. Our first round of plates were filthy with caked on tomato sauce. We were brought our appetizer but had to wait for utensils. Drink refills were also slow to be delivered. When our pizza arrived, it was cold, not even luke warm. Again, we were the only party in the restaurant. The waiter sincerely apologized and brought the pizza away. Not sure how they \"warmed\" it up but I t came back with the original pieces we had already taken bites out of and luke warm. 
The one star is for the manners of the waiter who did apologize many times. We will not try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Hidden gem that you will not regret stopping in.  The food quality is so authentic, real ingredients, made by real people! The service is always on point, and the crew here has been in place for years. A true family feel where they take pride in their craft. Only a few tables in the restaurant adds to the charm of and amazing intimacy. Closest thing to being in a friends kitchen!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Nice atmosphere and great customer service - we will be back for pasta!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Phenomenal food with vibrant flavor. A diamond in the ruff. Alex is a great guy who believes quality is better than quantity. His approach is spot on and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Location and interior decor of the restaurant are fine.   The Menu is varied and offers many choices. BUT....the service absolutely sucks!  First, I called for reservations...the gal that answered the phone didn't know if they took reservations, put me on hold 3 times and finally got our reservation.  When we got to the restaurant, they didn't have our reservation.  Ok, there was plenty of room; we had a party of 6.  Now the service gets worse.  The waiter sat us and it was at least 10 minutes before he took our drink order and another 10 minutes before we received the drinks.  I had to ask for bread, then ask for butter olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Then had to ask for bread plates for dipping; he said they only had 6 small plates in the entire restaurant...lol.   Finally we ordered and the food was delivered and the presentation was fine  ( not excellent ).  I had the Carbonara which actually was tasty and prepared correctly and my wife had Spaghetti and Meatballs.  There were 2 small tasteless meatballs in a tasteless sauce ( probably from a can ).  Others in our party had the Lasagne and the pizza; the reviews were ok but not great. The waiter didn't check up on our order until we were almost finished.   Conclusion:  we eat out often and have reasonable standards and expectations on food and service.  This eatery needs to so some serious training with their staff and review a few menu items.  Perhaps the local Gilbert clientele do not expect a better product.......but we do and there are plenty of places that exceed our expectations.  We will NOT return."}
{"text":"We went for a quick Sunday lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The Fig Prosciutto was delicious! My daughter's \"kid size\" mac n cheese was HUGE! 

Very nice service. 
We'll come back."}
{"text":"Q:  Is it good?  
A:  Yes!

Q:  Is it REALLY worth trying?  
A:  Oh yeah, for sure.

Q:  I heard it is in a scary neighborhood?
A:  Oh yeah, for sure.

Q:  Why did you give it 5 stars?    You are too easy!
A:  I give 5 stars if it really exceeded my expectations and I plan to return right away.  That is my criteria.

Any restaurant whose proprietor serves my dinner and drinks a beer in the back is high on my list.  BYOB FYI & a 7-11 nextdoor will help you out.

We split a Cesar salad that I thought was a little heavy on dressing.  I also like a slightly more creamy cesar dressing.  Preference.

We split the Antipasto and I thought it was light, flavorful and refreshing.  My partner found it a little simple.  Perhaps I agree.  But the Proscuitto was outstanding.  Just like Italy or Spain.

We split a pizza with a refreshingly light crushed tomato sauce, sausage and Rapini.  False advertising really as the Rapini is brocolli.   Mauro...  we need Rapini!!  Please!

Then we split a Tiramisu which can be dangerous with all those sharp little forks swinging around devouring such a yummy dessert in the desert.

What a fun treat that place is."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not the first one here....
I'm a fan. I was ready for a change of pace from the usual, and gave this place a shot. I am thoroughly impressed. Very, very small place, with only 20 patrons, tops, able to fit in here at once. The pizza oven is roaring away in plain sight from your table, and I think that added to the overall experience. All ingredients were fresh, with very nice serving plates and accoutrement. Our service was fantastic, probably because there was about one employee for every two patrons. My drink was refilled before it was empty, a plus, and the complimentary bread was delicious. We had a Caprese to start with a Margherita Pizza for dinner. Very traditional, very fresh, and now I consider this one of my go-to places. I'll be back soon. I don't recommend coming here with more than a party of four, tops, due to the size limitations. I hope they expand to a larger location, and bring all the same flavor with them...."}
{"text":"We were here last year and were hesitant to come back but heard they are under new ownership. The place is perfecto now! Pasta and sauces are fresh and delish and our group had great service, something that was lacking in the past. Full bar and good atmosphere, we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Came in 20 minutes before close and they were so welcoming. I got the ravioli and it was amazing! We also got the pollo something and that was so tasty! We will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"This place was awesome all around. Just moved here from Colorado and first pizza place.   The sauce is what makes a pizza and they definitely are unique.   And service top notch!"}
{"text":"Have they changed ownership? The food used to be OUTSTANDING. Now it is just OKAY. The service was very poor. The restaurant was not busy at all and we waited at least 15 minutes to be asked what we wanted to drink. Many parts of our order was forgotten. Our food came out sporadically. The servers seemed very confused. 
We won't be back."}
{"text":"Other reviews have covered everything about this place - it is small and located next to a Circle K, but the pizza is fantastic!  I actually like the pizza here better than Cibo.  I ordered the small Vegetarian pizza and the Caprese salad to share with a friend.  We were both stuffed and our total bill was only $18!  Great value for your money.  Plus the vegetarian was loaded with a variety of vegetables, including artichoke and zucchini.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food's been covered before so all this review will be is further social proof that this place does indeed rock.

  I've missed good veal cannelloni for a while now , looks like I wont need to anymore:)    For once it's not the processed grey stuffing that has one texture throughout  surrounded by an inner tube ( Cough  famous chain)    Erin's  Pollo Piccata was excellent  and the accompanying pasta was perfect.

Sadly  they fed me too well since I was dying to try the tiramisu  but the afternoons plans didn't involve  refrigeration.  Lastly thanks to all that  saw the excellent reviews and kept piling them on it really makes a big difference on how likely we've been to try new places."}
{"text":"Good but not quite great yet. 
Crust was yummy and meat lovers pizza was more saucey (savory not sweet.. Yum) than cheesey (which I loved) but the meat should have been cooked more (the edges were barely brown on the ones that were cooked enough) 
Service good and atmosphere nice. We'll try again..."}
{"text":"I know Italian food.  Why, because I am Italian.  I grew up eating Italian food made by my family.   My mother made her own pasta from scratch.   Now, let's get down to business.   I tried this place because of all the rave reviews.   Let me tell you this. Simply avoid this unless you enjoy cafeteria type of \"Italian food\" that is served in school lunch halls across the nation.  Yuck!  This guy should be ashamed of himself calling this Italian food.  Come on Yelpers and get with it.  Do me a favor.  Understand what it is to be called Italian.  It's not egg noodles with ketchup."}
{"text":"You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand. 

So. Fucking. Good.

My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.

The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.

Everything was homemade. And when I say \"everything,\" I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue. 

Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate. 

Go there. You won't be disappointed. 

But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, good friendly service, cute inside atmosphere, but the location is a nasty dump next to a Circle K in a seedy part of town with absolutely no parking.  I had to get up during my meal to get two teenage \"homies\" off my car.  Since when is it ok to lean on someone's car with a slurpie in your hand?

Pizza wasn't as thin as most Neopolitan pies.  Crust at the end was rather uniform too, in shape and consistency.  No irregularity which is the signature of a hand tossed pie (not that theirs isn't hand tossed).  Sauce delivered great tomato flavor and cheese was rich, and clearly high quality stuff.  Prices were reasonable.

I'm not kidding - there's maybe 4-5 parking spots and about 5 tables inside.  It's quaint, adorable, and the waiter seems to have an authentic Italian accent.  Food is very good, almost as good as that other famous pizza place in town, but my god this place needs a new location.  I thought this over for a few days before reviewing it and the location & parking just ruin the experience here, plus the lack of seating.  Unless you go right at the opening you'll have no idea when or if you'll actually get a table.  Silly."}
{"text":"On our way to Sedona, AZ from Long Beach, CA we were looking for a place to eat,  more particularly a good pizza place. Under these circumstances, one can drive around till you find what seems to be a remotely good pizza place, or log on on yelp! I prefer the ladder.

Great place, great food, but not the greatest location. But as one fellow yelper stated, your car is parked in front of your dining table, so one can keep a close eye.

Now to the food. The salad was great and there soup of the day was equally delicious. Now came the pizza. There pizza is delicious.. what distinguishes them from the rest is the how there pizza is prepared... everything is fresh, the dough, the cheese, the pepporoni and there tomatoes sauce is not just the regular pizza paste, this is actually prepared with real tomatoes. Throw it in the wood oven and what do you get... An extremely delicious A+ pizza. Would definitely come back if around the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"We met friends there last night and had an amazing wood baked pizza and delicious wine.  The waitress was great and everyone was so friendly. Awesome food!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They usually serve some sort of free bread and spread before your meal for free! Great thing for a small family place. :)

This restaurant is totally one of the most hidden treasures of Phoenix. I mean it's right next door to a Circle K! But the food is great, and they've created a very warm atmosphere inside.

I have tried a few of the house made pasta's, and while they're good I say go for the pizza. Their pizza has some of the freshest tomato sauce around, and the cheese is to die for. Actually that's all I need on a pizza, no more toppings please. I love the margarita pizza.

I came here for my birthday and got some free tiramisu, awesome!

Check it out if you love rustic pizza."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill since they closed the Scottsdale location and got new owners or cooks or whomever. I had not eaten here in a long time because the last few times I had been in the pizza was not as good as it used to be. I also had found a better place closer to home. Well, I thought I would give them another try tonight since the reviews are still good. It had been a long, hectic week at work. I happen to be driving by and I just wanted to sit down with my new book and eat. This was a very strange and demeaning experience. I have never had anything like this ever happen to me before. It upset me so I was compelled to write this update.  

This restaurant is very small. Too small for how popular it seems to be. They have only five tables in the place and if you sit at two of them it is very awkward since you are right by the kitchen door ( And in the way) or under the TV. I apparently forgot about that tonight.  It is certainly not a place to bring a party of fifteen and then book a party of eight. 

I walked in and there was a very long table of about 20 up against the wall. They really did not fit in the restaurant at all. The kids with them were very noisy and not being disciplined of course by any adults. The other three small tables were filled with diners looking non too happy at the noise level and squished floor space. I should have left right then and there but I was in no rush. I noticed that two of the \"Two Top\" tables were finishing up so I waited by the kitchen window to sit. Again, very awkward just standing there. I felt so in the way.  The server looked at me and said, \"Just give me just one minute. Here is a menu.\" Well, I stood there for about fifteen minutes. 

A couple left shortly after that. I assumed the table would be cleared for me but it never happened. I stood by the window for five more minutes waiting. Finally, I sat down at one of the tables. A busser and a staff member walked by twice and no one cleared the table or acknowledged me. I started looking at the menu. After ten more minutes the waitress came back and said. \"So are you wanting to eat? I was flabbergasted. I am thinking to myself, \"What the heck?\" \"Well, YES! I do want to eat since this is a restaurant, right? But I meekly look at her, smile, and say, \" Of course.\" Maybe she is having an off night with that crazy 20 top over on the wall. Needless to say I was very confused and starting to get frustrated. I wasn't sure how to answer or what she was trying to communicate. I assumed she forgot that she already asked me if I wanted take out or not. Not being a Harvard attorney I wanted to make sure to not go all postal on her.  

Well, the waitress finally asks, \"Well, do you want to eat here?\" I might note that she has made no effort to start clearing the dirty table either. So now I am very confused. Shall I eat here? What is that suppose to mean? Shall I eat here? Well heck no, maybe I will eat in the kitchen, bathroom, or on the floor? In the parking lot? I can only conclude they do not want my business. I am thinking to myself, \"Is this a joke? Am I on one of those reality TV shows? What is the problem here?\" I have no idea what is going on.

She then looks at me and says, \"Well, SHE said there is a reservation at eight.\"( I still have no idea who \"SHE\" is.) I looked at my watch which said 7:10pm. Again, super confused hungry gal here. Also, what does this have to do with me anyway? The server finally gets her act together to tell me they have a table of eight coming in with a reservation, not a reservation at 8pm. Wow, reservations at this place, Really? Okay, I still had no idea when or why she was telling me this since I was at a Two Top not an Eight Top. The only other tables in the place were Two Tops that all together did not add up to eight. A reservation of eight would not fit anywhere in this place, anytime soon.

I finally looked at her, forcing her to communicate. \"So are you saying you do not want to serve me? Do you not have room for me?\" I hate being a mind reader on a Friday night after working with 8 year old kids all day. To this question the server replies, \"No not at all. She says ( Who the heck is SHE?)  that we can bring you food. It has to be fast and you have to eat it fast. We need your table.\" Now I get it! I can not reply though because my jaw has fallen to the floor in utter shock at her request. I walked out on the spot.  

I was not sure how I felt about this. I totally understand having no room or a wait time. I even understand a reservation system since I eat out a lot. ( But shocked that such a divey place in the hood would take them) I can even understand they can not expand their space just for lil ole me. However, what I can not understand in any shape or form is why no one thought to tell me any of this before I wasted 30 minutes of my Friday night just standing there. Also, to tell a customer they need to rush their food intake, at an Italian place no less, is sinful!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here a few times and never even noticed it was there.  The place is tiny and situated at the end of a fairly ghetto looking strip mall.  It's so tiny that I even asked my husband as we were pulling in if they only did take-out like pizza hut.  Thankfully, this was not the case.

We sat ourselves inside the very small restaurant and watched the pizza maker guys for a few minutes before the server came around to us.  I have to say, this guy is very lucky that he is Italian and ridiculously adorable, otherwise he would have been pissing me off.  He was really absent minded and liked to talk on his cell phone.  To make up for it though, he was quite charming and made jokes with the patrons.  I admit I felt foolish when I saw a huge pizza being made and asked what it was, but his cute accent and description made it all better.

The food we had was calamari fritti and a regular sized meatball pizza.  The calamari was not so good.  I will warn anyone that orders it that it is a mixture of the typical rings and then the miniature squid bodies.  Those make me sick, and I can't eat them.  The rings were just too rubbery for me and the batter was way too light.  The marinara sauce that came with it was delicious though, and I do not like marinara sauce by itself.  The pizza was a little different than I expected.  The meatballs were once large and were sliced down to go on the pizza.  I was just expecting baby meatballs, so this was still okay.  The fresh mozzarella combined with the delicious marinara sauce and the very flavorful meatballs made for a wonderful pizza experience.  The husband even ate the crust first.  He NEVER eats crust.  It was really good crust.

I probably won't be back to dine in here, but I will certainly be ordering to-go from them.  Maybe I will place an order and then run across the street to occupy myself in the Ocean Floor and stare at the big fishies.  Bottom line, excellent pizza, fair prices, and it's better than Bianco's."}
{"text":"I really can't say much more than anyone else.

It is hidden and you'll probably miss it.  It is small and you may not get a table.  Service is awesome.  The pizza is amazing.  Really amazing.  It may be the best in Arizona.  I don't know if there is better pizza but it sure ain't from Chris Bianco.  

I just wish they had a Sicilian-style....so no 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Wine is always on point, manager is always delighted to see you and greets you warmly like your family.  Look forward to coming again after we leave."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent, so was the cannelloni. Great service and nice atmosphere. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"You can't deny the likability of an honest man running a little Italian restaurant.  The 7-9 tables that make up this great neighborhood find, the attentive service by the service staff who was also helping cook in the kitchen, and the unexpected quality food that came out were 3 key ingredients that make this a 5-Star Find!  

Even though the name of this place suggests ordering pizza, I didn't actually get to taste the pizza. :(...but I saw it and it looked amazing! Next time. 

What I did find was MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT GNOCCHI!!!
  I ordered the Gnocchi alla Sorrentina and it was fantastico!  The only way to describe this dish (which on this night came with a vodka sauce instead of their usual tomato sauce i guess) was a plate full of little fluffy pillows of deliciousness!!!  It was a great dish that I will be coming back for.  

Thank you Pizza A Metro for a great dinner...and Victor, don't be afraid to expand...a few extra tables might be a nice move for you."}
{"text":"Why is it that the best places are a little hard to find? In a little bit of a sketched out area?
Some people call them diamonds in the rough. I would just call them restaurants in phoenix. 

Sunday I went to Pizza A Metro. I haven't been to this side of town in awhile. I'm CenPho and I hardly ever venture outside my hood. But I keep hearing how great this place is and was feelin some pizza. 

First thing I noticed when I entered the door...I've seen larger hot dog carts. The atmosphere is super cozy, seating is comfortable and we didn't need to wait long. Already three good things right? 

Looked over the menu and listened to the daily specials.

We opted for the soup of the day, a Caesar salad, some fried calamari and a small pizza.

We were not looking to gorge, but definitely wanted to try different things from the menu.

Soup of the day was OMG delicious. It was like a frittata in a bowl of soup. Scrambled eggs, spinach, in a chicken broth with sliced meatballs.

I almost cleaned the bowl. It was insanely good.

Caesar Salad was awesome. Crispy lettuce not overly dressed. A very good salad.

The fried calamari was excellent. Not overly fried, lightly battered and golden fried. Not too dark, not too crunchy. Dipping sauce was good, but found just some lemon and they were awesome.

We ordered a small pizza and it had artichoke, olives, cheese, ham and it was awesome.

After all the rest of the food I ate, just had a few small slices and took the rest home.


Everything was wonderful. I give this place 6 stars. But since 5 is the max...deal with it."}
