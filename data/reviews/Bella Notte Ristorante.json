{"text":"What a nice find! My boyfriend and I were tired Sat night and wanted to lay low and rather sick of traveling to Old Scottsdale for a decent meal and needed a respite from the few decent restaurants in the Troon North area.. Well what a nice surprise good Italian food was found close to home. We  r happy to say the chicken parm was delicious!!! Almost as good as what we get in NY C. We also ordered the fettucini w bolognese which was also good. Our waiter Chris was awesome and we had an outrage desert. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Staff were excellent and the food was very good. Loved the Scallopine Alla Marsala. Check out Rate Earth next door for a pre-dinner glass of wine."}
{"text":"I've created an account to rate this restaurant. And after watching Kitchen Nightmares with Chef Gordon Ramsey I have seen a few others do the same for these so called \"nightmares\" of a restaurant.  Myself, and a group of 8 others had made reservations to go to Bella Notte in Whitby for my lovely girlfriend's father's birthday party. Traditional Italian family with a flare for food, reservations had been made and we had shown up on time and seated promptly.  After hearing their specials from one of the waiters the owner came out to question us about a bottle of wine my girlfriend's brother had bought for the occasion. The owner informed us the corking fee for this bottle of wine was $35 CAD which we said we were fine with.  Dinner was had, and although there was a few problems (calamari was very undercooked and rubbery, other elements of dinner were not al dente or soggy) we didn't really complain and continued on.  As the rather large bill for 9 guests came to the table, the brother (whom was paying for the meal) noticed the owner had silently increased the corking fee to $50 CAD.  We decided to question him about this, which began this restaurants downfall. The owner quickly danced around the question of the increase in price and decided to take us on a business lesson of his margins, and how if we had purchased this \"rather generic\" bottle of wine at his restaurant he would've made more money - and thus, should punish us for bringing it by increasing the corking fee, even though he had simply stated earlier it was $35 as he picked the bottle up.  The owner began to tell us the bottle was larger than he expected, and this was the reason for the increase. I can assume the owner who had quite a good wine selection on the other side of the restaurant had seen a bottle of this size before, and upon grabbing it could tell it was larger and thus inform us of the increase, but he decided to sneak it onto our bill.  After a few exchanges, excuses, and rude comments in regards to giving us a measly $15 refund, he came back with a $15 gift card and threw it on the table. At this point, he might as well have given us a blank piece of paper as we weren't coming back to this restaurant ever. As a small business owner myself, there's a larger lesson here - if you make a mistake and tell a customer something, suck it up and make it right. $15 is nothing in this transaction where he probably had made hundreds of dollars in profit on us that night, and to satisfy a customer (and have a repeat visit), as well as accept you made a mistake it would've been no problem for him.  We had left upset, and angry at the fact the owner would not accept he made a mistake, and charged us for it.  I would seriously consider not visiting Bella Notte any time soon if you are interested in going. If the owner is not willing to bend a bit for customer satisfaction, it shows a much larger problem trickling down from top, to your plate."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We went there with 4 people on My birthday and had the best time. We sat outside and had excellent service. We met the owner herself which is the sweetest lady you'll ever wanna meet. My husband and I love peroni so she actually gave us  2 glasses to keep. Everyone enjoyed there food and we cannot wait to be back. See you on my dads birthday!!"}
{"text":"Ug! I took my guy out for dinner and what a disappointment. 1 mi from out house and looking for a great Italian restaurant at a fare price.  Pasta primavera no veggies! Let me take that back, there were peas and tomatoes for $19.99?  Sent  back, owner very gracious. Atmosphere was good,cute bar, strong drinks but too dark. One lady actually had flashlights attached to her glasses to read the menu. Service was confusing, had to ask for menus.  Perhaps this was all due to the fact they were only open 4 weeks. We will try again when the dust settles."}
{"text":"Very noisy and busy - so noisy it was hard to carry on a conversation. Mediocre Cesar salad was $10. Lobster Mac and cheese was watery. Wife's salmon was good. A second round of wine for some ladies arrived without being ordered and of course they didn't want to make a fuss so drank only half. Prices were out of kilter with the quality. But service was good.   No rush to return."}
{"text":"Wow Michelle G!! My husband and I live near by the restaurant and eat there on a weekly basis. I disagree with many points you listed. They owners and staff are incredibly nice, good people and I find it hard to believe anyone there treated you poorly. I have enjoyed both entrees you tried and think that they are amazing. In my opinion, and judging by your other reviews, you clearly do not enjoy anything in life and perhaps you should dine in your own home, seeing as you can do better yourself. IGNORE MICHELLE'S POSTING AND EVERY ONE IN THE FUTURE. The statement is very true: You cannot please everybody. Carry on Bella Notte!! You are still amazing and do not let people who make piss poor reviews bother you. We will be seeing you this week."}
{"text":"Since we have a residence nearby, we decided to try Bella Notte. We all thought the food was good but not great. I can't put my finger on what is  missing, but maybe it's just a lack of creativity. The owners, with deep Italian accents, certainly provide an authentic aura, but I would have hoped for a little more in regards to the food. The service was fine and they were quite attentive. We will definitely give them another shot."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the little neighborhood around Troon North!  The place was packed and they did at least one-and-a-half turns while we were there.  It's catching on.  The staff is energetic and eager to please. (Our waiter was not only personable, but very professional and his recommendations were top-notch.)  As for the owners, the whole family works there (front and back of the house).  They are accommodating, fun, on top of their game, and the food is delish!  (Even if you are not a dessert person - - and if you are, but tiramisu is not your thing - - trust me, you'll become a fan here.  Tiramisu: from the Italian phrase meaning \"pick me up.\"  They had to pick me up on a wheelbarrow after my instantaneous weight-gain. But I am unashamed--it was worth every calorie!)"}
{"text":"Our dining experience began with the hostess seating us and providing us with only a meagerly populated wine list. We perused the list, but having no idea what was on the menu, were not inclined to select a bottle of wine as we had no clue what we would be eating. I opted for a glass of mediocre Chianti for $12 and my husband ordered a draft of Peroni for $6. Our server hastily snatched the drink menu from our hands only to inform us that they were presently out of Peroni and brought a dark version of Moretti, as an alternative, which we later learned when the check came, cost $9, and my husband did not care to drink.  It is truly astounding that any restaurant, even in Scottsdale, charges $9 for a twelve ounce bottle of beer! This can be noted as rip-off #1.  Dinner menus finally arrived along with a basket containing four miniscule slices of low quality bread. Our server methodically rattled off the daily specials, one of which included a daily soup that, just like the entrees listed as specials, was accompanied by no description of what the item actually contained. We placed our orders and for lack of anything else to choose from, opted for a bottle of the Chianti that I had previously had. My husband ordered the Caesar salad, which was the only palatable item of our entire evening. I ordered the soup of the day after having asked for more clarification as to what it actually was. The server described it as an Italian wedding soup and highly recommended it over the pasta fagioli on the menu. I was delivered nothing even remotely similar to an Italian wedding soup, which typically contains vegetables and more importantly, has FLAVOR. I received a bowl of hot water that was chock full of cooked spinach with some nondescript and flavorless white items, which I can only assume were egg whites floating in it. The soup was so incredibly tasteless that if I were to have closed my eyes, other than the mushy, chewy texture of the cooked spinach, I would have had no clue what I was eating.   As we were consuming our first course, the hostess arrived at our table after locating the bottle of wine that we had ordered. She proceeded to engage in a physical war with the wine bottle in an attempt to open it, repeatedly telling us that it had been a long time since she'd had to open one of these and it was always very difficult for her to get this right. In her struggle to cut the foil from the bottle, she managed to violently shake the bottle in a vigorous manner, thereby ensuring that any sediment that had settled out of the wine was now once again suspended in the wine. This was confirmed when she poured the sediment-mixed liquid into our glasses. In her course of making conversation, she did ask how my soup was, to which I replied that it had no flavor. She graciously brought me the Caesar, which was quite good despite having the saltiest anchovies that I've ever tasted present on top of it.   Our entrees soon arrived, mine being the eggplant parmesan for $22 and my husband's being the \"Linguine Malafemmena\" for $27, which is described on the menu as \"lobster, shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, garlic, white wine & fresh tomato\". My entrée consisted of two thick, tough, bready, and greasy tasting slices of eggplant having a tasteless tomato sauce and half-melted slices of processed mozzarella on top, the entire mess seated on a bed of fresh-out-of-the-box spaghetti drenched in the same flavorless tomato sauce and accompanied by a limp side of overcooked carrots, zucchini, squash, and broccoli. The entire plate was at best lukewarm. The eggplant seemed as though it hadn't been heated throughout, which would explain the unmelted cheese on top. Note this as rip-off #2. That having been said, frighteningly, my entrée was the better of the two. My husband's seafood pasta dish, instead of having a white wine sauce, was drenched in a sickly, brown butter sauce, which we both despise and would not have ordered the entrée had it been described as such. The worst part, though, was the complete lack of lobster, which is noted as the first item in the description. We both mined through the dish to attempt to find anything that resembled lobster. The only item that we found was a tiny shred that measured approximately 14 of an inch by 1/8 of an inch in size, which we assumed (hopefully) was lobster. The only other seafood to be found in the dish was 2-3 shrimp of mediocre size and quality and one small scallop that had been cut into multiple pieces. Essentially, this was a $27 dish which consisted of a plate of pasta in an awful brown butter sauce with only the tiniest hint of seafood ingredients. Clearly, this was rip-off #3.  I truly cannot express what an incredibly disappointing and excessively costly dining experience this was. I've posted a photo of our itemized bill as evidence since I, personally, would find it difficult to believe that there are actually restaurants that charge $148 for a dinner as awful as this was."}
{"text":"Love Bella Notte. The food is awesome as is the staff. Michael is friendly and approachable and a great host. Love the classy renovations too."}
{"text":"Lovely spot. Food was very good and well presented. Nice wine selection. Service very good and attentive. Just the right size for a cozy feel."}
{"text":"Daddy-Daughter Day was upon us and my father picked me up for dinner. It was a Saturday night and we did not have reservations. We stopped at a few places and ended up at Bella Notte. A classy, Italian spot that we were fortunate to snag a table at. The décor and servers had all of the trimmings of a traditional Italian restaurant.   My Dad ordered half a dozen, fresh oysters. They were served cold with a lemon dressing and lemon wedges. It was my first time eating oysters. The texture was interesting, but not unpleasant. The lemon complimented their natural, briny flavour.    What's an Italian restaurant without pasta? My Dad chose his usual, Pasta Primavera, and I went with the Spaghetti Carbonara. The dishes arrived piping hot and piled high. While I snapped a few photos and ate with my eyes.....when I realized I had penne noodles. Not a big deal, but it's called Spaghetti Carbonara. I expected long, difficult to eat noodles....especially since they brought me a spoon. Puzzled and hungry, our dishes didn't last. 90% of the time, I end up with a doggy bag when it comes to pasta. Not today. It was delicious. Smothered in a mellow cream sauce, full of fresh peas and pancetta. The pancetta was ok; sometimes crunchy, but very salty. My Dad was pleased and he too cleaned his plate. He uses the primavera as a test for any restaurant that serves it. He said it was pretty up there on the list!   The dessert menu looked AMAZING and I wanted it so bad, but we were far too full. I will save that for another day.    There WILL be another day.   This is a great place for dates or large groups and the service is fantastic and very professional.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  We were staying at the Four Seasons and they recommended this place.  i have to say being a NYorker and american italian im pretty picky...and our dishes were  good!  We sat outside because it was a beautiful night..we sat near the outside fireplace...it was very nice!!   Also, the music was very fitting..nice authentic italian music!!  fried calamari..drinks..main dishes were good.  the dessert..cannoli(good for arizona..lol).  fruit dessert in a large martini glass was fantastic!!  Wait staff was excellent..our waiter Chris couldn't have been nicer.  They also gave us(on the house) a glass of Limoncello..which was nice touch!! I would also say dining in AZ is a little earlier so we had to get use to this.   we went around 9pm and it was winding down..so eastcoasters... get to this restaurant and start making it later dining!"}
{"text":"Great Italian resto in Whitby.  There are not many good places to eat in Oshawa and Whitby- this is one of the few!  Genuine Italian meals prepared from scratch. Good wine list and room for groups.  Everything we tried was fantastic - no wonder it has been around for so many years- thanks to the kind owner and staff."}
{"text":"We were here for a wedding and it was a beautiful setting for a simple wedding.  The food was good - not a fan of the veal as I found it over cooked but the mini quiches, bruschetta, pasta and desserts were amazing! Odd thing the bathrooms were not AC and we all thought we would have heat stroke in there!  The service was wonderful and super attentive. I would go to try as a couple!"}
{"text":"Top notch in every aspect. The service was and is outstanding and everyone makes you feel at home, like any great Italian family. Chris our server the last three times, yes a very frequent diner - hey amazing food what can I say - was great as usual. The specials are alway to die for, as is the rest of the menu. If they have it, a must, the Colorado lamp chops in a balsamic honey glaze, or the pork chop with mushrooms and Dijon sauce (on the regular menu). Salivating right now. I disagree with the comment that the menu is pricy. You get what you pay for and you will not find this quality, creativity and flavor in you 12.00 per plate pasta joint. This is an upscale restaurant that serves some of the best and authentic Italian dishes, so if you are in the mood to have your taste buds spoiled and being served by superbly capable and friendly people, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great local Restaurant, very invitng, the staff makes you feel right at home and the food was outstanding. Love Phil the owner/chef stopping by the table and his family who run the place...Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can go back and enjoy the Patio!"}
{"text":"My review is based on two trips - both in large groups. If a place can handle groups as efficiently and professionally as Bella Notte did, I can only expect that a normal dining experience would be outstanding.  The food was great in all respects, or at least almost - I had chicken parmigiana on one occasion that was a little too done - but not so much that I didn't thoroughly enjoy the meal. A nice salad with an excellent viniagrette accompanied both meals, and I must say that I love that warm bread comes out with a very nice black olive tapenade, though I'd love an olive oil/balsamic option too for all that bread I eat even though I shouldn't.  Service was prompt and efficient.  The wine list offers a lot of nice options for bottles and half-litres as well as by the glass. A good selection of cocktails as well, classics and new ideas.  Nice spot for a night out."}
{"text":"This is a very good Italian restaurant. I would actually have given them 5 stars but the dish I had could have used just a little more flavour in my opinion.  Bet the I am one who prefers bold flavours. The app my son and I shared was the Prosciutto Wrapped Sea Scallops and it was truly a 10/10. I had the Linguini Lobster as my main, and like I said it could have had a little more pizzaz, but it was still quite delicious.  The lobster was really well seasoned, but the sauce for the pasta was a little milder than I prefer. My son had the Veal Scaloppini Napolitano, which I tasted and was very impressed with.  The olive/caper mix was really delicious. The Limoncello Cheesecake for desert was absolutely to die for. Over all the experience was excellent, the food is really good, the service is spot on, and the decor is warm and inviting. I will repeat."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, service and food was bellissimo! Try the Angeloni spicy pasta....yummy! Large portions and reasonable prices! Can't wait to dine on the patio! Oh and don't forget dessert....lemon sorbet served in hollowed out real lemons....delightfully lite and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I celebrated valentines dinner at Bella Notte and was quite impressed with the food. Understandably they were very busy but I did not expect the service to be so slow. We had to wait to place our order, wait for our drinks to arrive, remind the staff when we got our appetizers that we were not served any bread. When they did finally bring the bread they only brought 2 small pieces (one per person) which I thought was a bit ridiculous. Our server had to be reminded that we had ordered our dessert. Had we not, we would have been sitting there for much longer.  I would rate the food 3.5 out of 5 stars  I would rate the service 1.5 out of 5 stars I understand it was a very busy evening but with 8 servers I thought they should have been able to manage the service levels. I will certainly go back again for the food and can only hope I get better service next time."}
{"text":"We have loved this place over the years but last night was not good. Horrible waitress who was unfriendly and just bad. We had to ask for everything and had to top up our own wine glasses. Empty plates sat on our table for ages. Food was just OK. Taste of summer menu."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner to go! - Having just returned from our honeymoon, and out of sheer exhaustion, I ordered our entire Thanksgiving dinner from Bella Notte - turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, bread with herbed butter (fabulous!), autumn vegetables, yams with marshmallows, and pumpkin pie - the entire cost was LESS than what I would have spent at the market, and all we had to do was reheat... the slow heating filled the house with beautiful aromas, the bird was brown and juicy, the potatoes fluffy, gravy rich, all in all a marvelous meal. On Saturday after Thanksgiving we had a 2nd dinner at a friends - but this one was better ... I have spent $300 - 400 setting up a holiday dinner for 8 in the past, and we spend UNDER $200, with extras, and had leftovers after feeding 8 people! And I was so much less stressed! Thank you Chef!"}
{"text":"Every time we've been to this restaurant they have offered exceptional food and exceptional service. Great atmosphere and prices are right for the area. This is definitely one of our favorite spots to go for a nice dinner or happy hour spot! Good job! Anyone in this area knows there are slim pickings for good food & service."}
{"text":"Been here for two large celebrations (graduations) and a couple of time just with family.  They were exceptional with our groups, super attentive and the food was great.  The manager went above and beyond.  Good Italian food."}
