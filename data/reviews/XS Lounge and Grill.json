{"text":"All Style, No Substance.  Husband I came for dinner on a Friday evening as part of a Groupon deal.  No one greeted us at the door, so we seated ourselves.  Server brought drinks promptly but slopped mine while serving - then disappeared for 15 minutes.  Eventually, after getting up and physically tracking her down across the restaurant and asking for something to mop up the spill, she brought a single cocktail napkin. A customer shouldn't have to negotiate with a server to bring a cloth to clean up a sticky spill, and drinks should be served with a beer mat or a cocktail napkin as a matter of course. .   Food was ok.  A tad overcooked, definitely over-salted, and corners were cut on quality and freshness.  The ratio of soda to syrup was off at the bar, resulting in Coke that was little more than brown-coloured soda-water.  Service was very slow, and definitely under trained.  Staff seemed unsure about what to do, and were lacking in the basic principles of food service.  There were two servers plus a manager working the room, with between 7 and 9 tables of guests during the time we were there.     It took just over 2 hours to get through appetizer, main and dessert for two people.  We weren't lingering, and I could see no reason for service to drag out to over two hours.  I was told, \"the kitchen is backed up\".  We ordered dessert (white chocolate brownie) and waited just over half an hour for it to be served.  After prompting, it arrived - cold and stale.  It almost made me wonder if a gang of robbers had come into the restaurant and found no money on the premises, so tied up the real staff in the back and decided to work the restaurant for a couple of hours to cut their losses.    Groupon is often the last ditch effort by a restaurant to drum up business.  This restaurant would be better off training staff and raising standards then by offering groupon discounts."}
{"text":"The 2nd time we have been here.  We came because of a groupon.  It was really slow service.  I would say that the kitchen didn't anticipate how busy they would be.  Food was luke warm and not really worth the wait.  The most disappointing part was the 25 minute wait for the white chocolate brownie.  It wasn't even warm and tasted like it was out of a box.  Really too bad if they want to expand beyond their hotel clientele.  Staff up when you put out a groupon, because typically when people buy groupons they are trying your restaurant for the first time.  You didn't leave a lasting impression with me with the long wait time.  Food is tasty, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"It was in the middle out of nowhere but what a hidden gem! Food was so good. My friend and I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and food is always great. I ordered fillet mignon everytime and never been dissapointed. However my husband orderd ribeye and the first time we were there it was over seasoned. So the second time he asked for less seasoning. ( came with no seasoning at all, barely that u cant taste it ). Soup was great. Service was ok. You kinda have to seat yourself. Overall experience was good. So still 4 star."}
{"text":"Awesome food and excellent wait staff.  Two thumbs up The whole experience with the restaurant/lounge/hotel was amazing.  We truly enjoyed our time there.  It was a perfect way to start our holiday.  We enjoyed the food, drinks and the staff.  All were very pleasant and accomadating   the beef short rib with mashed potatoes and AMAZING sautated spinach,grape tomatoes in a butter Montreal seasoning mix!  The chef had come out to check on us.  I gushed about about the spinach and he caved and gave me the recipe.  Which I have prepared several times since we returned home.    I can not wait to return to Calgary and this hotel/restaurants....."}
{"text":"First off to clarify, this used to be Ric's Grill but it's now XS Lounge and Grill so I will be reviewing it as so.  I dropped by after work today with a few colleagues for some casual drinks. Very upscale and professional looking lounge that gives you an upscale impression. It was extremely quiet and I can't see it getting too busy even at peak times given the off the beaten path location; primary clientele is likely patrons staying at the hotel.  Anyways, this visit was just drinks so I can't comment on the food. As far as drinks go I was actually surprised they had a fairly good selection of beers on tap and bottle. I'm typically happy to find any form of craft beer at an upscale type lounge. Ironically I just went with a domestic on this occasion (doing this calorie counting thing right now and needed a light beer... that's another story). It's good to know they have some decent options for potential future visits though! Prices are slightly high I'd say but expected for this kind of lounge, daily specials and happy hour are options but nothing that will blow you away.  Our server Antony was quick and efficient, solid server and no complaints with how he handled our table. So overall it was a quick, simple and good visit. Hopefully next time I'll be able to try the food :)."}
{"text":"Mediocre service, just better than average food. Really disappointing considering it's connected to the hotel. Sit as a group for sure to get attention."}
{"text":"Very nice hotel, modern and clean. XS is kind of an upscale sportsbar. Service was fine. Drinks OK. My wings were undercooked but I ate them anyways because of the extra hot sauce. Will know in about 6 hours if I made the wrong decision"}
{"text":"I visited XS Lounge with my family recently for dinner. The restaurant's ambiance is quite nice and we were initially pleased when we walked in. Our server was very friendly and attentive.   I was disappointed because I have a number of allergies and I felt like they couldn't really accommodate as well as other restaurants can. I ordered the New York Striploin and didn't enjoy my meal at all. The steak, veggies and mashed potatoes were extremely bland. They were so bland that I actually felt like the potatoes were tasteless.   My mother and brother ordered the Ribeye and were fairly pleased. My father ordered the Rack of Lamb and was also fairly satisfied with his meal.  They don't have many dessert options and I didn't feel comfortable trying the one option they said was nut-free as they gave me the impression that they weren't certain. The presentation of the desserts were nice but overall according to my family, they tasted very ordinary."}
