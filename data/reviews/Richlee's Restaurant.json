{"text":"Excellent food, good friendly service and cozy atmosphere. We have enjoyed Richlee on every visit. Prices not bad at all for the quality of the food. Great new management that lives up to the restaurant's excellent reputation. My husband and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ate here before going to Italy for two weeks and I ate here after. This may sound like hyperbole, but the best dishes available at Richlee's Ristorante are on par with the best dishes in Rome and Florence and Milan. 

I have had several meals here, never a bad one. I had my birthday party in the upstairs private room and it was a wonderful success. The flavours are distinct and rich and delicious. The service is friendly. The decor is old school library full of single malt scotch.

What more can be said? It's a marvelous restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here with a Buytopia coupon.  It's 2 stars, but I'm not saying it's totally bad.  Rather, there are reasons for a below average rating.  It pains me to write this as the service and the people there were so nice to us, but I hope they improve/change to get more people through the door.

1. The prices, holy smokes.  With the prices like these, I was expecting to be in downtown Toronto, eating downtown Toronto quality food.

2. Food quality.  Some of the food was very salty.  They were very generous with things like truffle oil, and cheese...  It's just that overall, the salt was too much, and made my wife not feel so good.

3. Outdated.  First impression walking in, the place has charm with some old wood trim and style.  Hard to find anymore.  However, I did not expect the food to be caught in that time warp as well, as the dishes we ordered definitely tasted like the food we had dining out growing up (yup, aged myself!)."}
{"text":"I never tire of eating here! The food is always delicious, made with care and delivered with just as much finesse! The portions are quite big so bring an empty stomach. I do not drink wine but judging from the extensive wine menu, I would imagine connoisseurs come here purposely for their wine selection. I would recommend the grilled calamari....YUM!"}
{"text":"On my birthday, my husband and I were in a rush to to find a restaurant to eat at.  We were suppose to find something close to the Ed Mirvish theatre as we were going to see a musical after.  Traffic made us get off at Avenue and we just drove down looking for fairly nice looking restaurants.  We stumbled upon Richlee's.  
We were surprisingly very happy with this restaurant.  We didn't know what to expect at all.  Nice little restaurant. Reminded me of when I went to Italy.  They have a LARGE selection of wine.  I recommend \"ass kisser\". We don't usually get appetizers.  Just a main and MAYBE dessert.  Since we were in a rush we browsed the menu.  They have a varity of different dishes.  Veal, steak, seafood, lamb.  I was about to order the plain lobster with salad but the waiter came over and told us the specials and there was a really good lobster and pasta special which I ordered.  My husband ordered the Lamb chops with pistachios.  Amazing.  My dish was amazing also.  They even sent out 3 little brushetta's on the house.  Dinner came prompltly.  (then again we were the only people in there--I don't mind, more intimate).  At the end of dinner, the owner came by our table with a bottle of brandy and two small shot glasses, she said it helps your food go down smooth.  It was actually quite tasty.  She did talk for a little while, but nothing annoying.  Our waiter was very friendly also.  I'm not sure about other days/nights but our experience was intimate..after 2 other couples came, mature.  
Btw, the owner said she would soon be renovating the place and changing the name to \"Mennie's Place\" (spelling?)."}
