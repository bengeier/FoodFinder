{"text":"I love this place. The people are awesome, the food is great, and the beer prices are unbeatable. There are food specials every day of the week, great Dj's wednesday through saturday and they show as many sporting events as they can on their 6 TV's. The pirogues, patty melt, and beer battered fries are a home run in my book, not to mention the 20oz draft glasses. They have theme nights once a month and ladies night and karaoke every wednesday! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great environment and great food! Waitresses were very nice, and the bar is reasonably priced. Get the beer battered fries, they are delicious."}
{"text":"Very little staff. Getting a drink can be extremely challenging when they get busy. Came up here once and the kitchen wasn't open because someone went home sick."}
{"text":"I like it because it's horrible.  People watching is really fun, drinks are pretty cheap, everything about the decor is a nightmare, it's in a basement... Somehow, I actually enjoy it.  Most of the people I take there do not.  It's good for groups because it's usually empty and you can rearrange the furniture however you want."}
{"text":"oh my sweet lordy. if you wanna talk about a dive bar, Bamboozles delivers. I'd probably rate it higher if my memory was clearer from that night, but let's patch together what I do recall.  - cheap-ass drinks. I asked for a Yuengling and was told it'd be 4 bucks. okay, not bad. yeah, but it was a 20-ouncer (a British pint) - the express from Drunk Central Station is now boarding on track 20!  - lots of space. it's in the basement of a building. small dance/stage area, plenty of tables, a huge bar, and even a small outdoor patio (mostly for smokers).  - decent music. DJ was playing a mix of 80s, 90s and current tunes. including, but not limited to, \"The Humpty Dance\" by Digital Underground.  - a wide array of characters. but the winners had to be the stunt doubles of Dolph Lundgren, Rick Moranis, and Snooki though!  - some old-ass video and pinball games.  - and what would a dive bar be without some odd quirk that only the regulars would understand? in this case, a big ol' bell that they ring every so often. I honestly can't remember what it was for. someone explained it to me, but my train had already left to Drunksville..."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers and french onion soup were ok, cheeseburger was flavorless.  For the price, you could get better food elsewhere.  Seems more like a place for the \"regulars\" who go for the environment, and not necessarily the food..."}
{"text":"Bamboozles is a great place for some dinner and a beer after work.  Though they have a bit of a limited menu, everything I have tried has been delicious, and their daily specials are all great.  The place is a bit of a dive, and is actually in the basement of the building, with the only entrance through the back.  They have a small patio outside the entrance, and you can be served on the patio when it is open, but it tends to be full of smokers.  Beer selection is a bit limited, but prices are cheap, and they have allot of specials, including ladies' night, where women get three free drink tickets with the purchase on one drink, and tuets on Thursday and Saturdays.  The bar is mostly regulars in their 40s, with the occasional youngin, but the food is great (especially the broccoli bites) the prices are reasonable, and the waitresses and bartenders are attentive and kind.  I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a quiet bar and some good food!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for trivia..and man what a gem! During happy hour bottled domestics are only $1.75 and when the entertainment starts they are only $2! On top of that since we went on a Tuesday it was $0.35 wing night! They have handful of sauces and the spicy garlic was not bad. They give a ton of ranch and blue chesse which earns high remarks for me. As far the wings they were not the worst nor the best I've had but you can't beat the price. The beer fries on the other hand were absolutely delicious. Prob one of the top 3 fries I have had in Cleveland since moving here. I would be happy just ordering 2 baskets of those with ranch for dipping and be a solid night. For wings, fries, potato skins and 6 beers the total was $20. Hell of a steal. The only disappointing thing was that they do not have their pizza oven yet and I wanted a slice of pizza. The atmospshere was nice and relaxed with multiple tv and a few dart boards. I am def going to come back for a slice a pizza and more trivia and cheap beer. The service was great and they were very friendly which is always refreshing. Overall, this a great little bar worth checking out."}
