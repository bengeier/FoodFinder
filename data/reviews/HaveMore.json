{"text":"This is a little food court place and I saw a lonely fish cutlet. So I decided to help the fish cutlet by eating it! It was a good spice. Also, I tried the chicken samosa, the pastry is thinner than regular and the chicken have a very good spice to it! So initially I was going to give it a 3.5 stars, but after the samosa, I bumped it up to a 4!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken curry with naan ($5.99) for lunch.  Chicken curry was quite delicious.  It was rich and flavourful.  But the naan was pretty bad.  The good and bad average out, so the rating is 3 stars."}
{"text":"The thali was really good . Delicious. They were struggling to complete an order I guess."}
