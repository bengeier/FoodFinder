{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and really liked it.

I hope the elderly owners are still going strong. I was served by their son who now had a few gray hairs. So did I.

I'm not sure there are any seats there and if there is, you really don't want to sit there. This is really for take out. I haven't been here for a couple of years.

The small oxtail dinner that I ordered for lunch was nine something with tax included. My wife and I shared it. There was too much rice and not enough oxtail for the price my wife thought. I heated up the rest and found the oxtail with all the dry rice needing of sauce.So this experience was not great, a 6.75/10 but throughout the years, I received 7.5/10 food and service and will give them that as a score.

I recall the oxtail at Cravins being better.

3.75 stars. 7.5/10"}
{"text":"Food: Jerk chicken was surprisingly and amazingly tender. One of the best jerk chicken in the city. The biggest difference is the chicken is cooked just right, with the right amount of seasoning, and the meat isn't dried and hard like many of the restaurants and take out places. Recommended!

Service: The gentlemen there were nice, polite and friendly. They give you a box, tissue and utensil, which is needed and appreciated. Nothing else to expect from a take-out only place. Great! 

Environment: Small, not much room to stand inside the ordering area if you go with a few friends for take out. 

Overall: Recommended."}
{"text":"Based on reviews I thought I'd give this place a try. I was severely disappointed. The jerk chicken lacked flavour, I mean the chicken was totally bland. It wasn't even a tiny bit spicy or jerked. It tasted like plain baked chicken with zero seasoning. The rice was bland, the gravy had minimal flavour. The food was barely warm. The coleslaw looked like it came out of a DOLE coleslaw bag from the grocery store. I mean, I was so disappointed. Trust me, don't waste your money here on Jamaican food. I recommend, twice as nice on Kingston Road, pj's take out on Kennedy Road, island spice flava on Pitfield Road, Ritz on Yonge Street and raps authentic Jamaican food on Eglinton ave west just to name a few great spots. The restaurants I just recommended are legit. Food is great at all locations. But not negrils. I will not come back here ever again. Let's put it like this, if you were to try Jamaican food for the first time in life and you decided that Negril's would be the first joint you tried, I'll tell you that this spot would give Jamaican/Caribbean food a horrible first impression in taste. It's that bad. Don't listen to these other reviews. I'm totally on point. And I'm from Jamaica so I know how good Jamaican food should taste! Bottom line, don't come here for Jamaican food. It's horrible, didn't enjoy it one bit."}
{"text":"Despite my adventurous dining attitude, sometimes I just want to warm myself with a reliable meal, and with flavours that speak to my childhood. In this case, Negril Jerk Food fit the bill.

Negril is a small, takeout only spot at Steeles and Middlefield. There's nothing flashy or extra about Negril, and apparently it doesn't have to be, because these guys have been in the area for years, selling staple Jamaican dishes. Along with welcoming and down-home service, you can opt for meals like: curry goat, jerk pork, snapper, and snacks like patties, soups, and festival. 
This time around I chose the oxtail dinner and coco bread & patty as a side. The oxtail dinner comes with plenty of seasoned rice and healthy helping of oxtail. Like I said, I was in search of reliable flavours, and that's what I got. I can't play around and say that it was amoung the best oxtail meals I've had, but I was happily satisfied. The coco bread and patty on the other hand was a step outside of what I had past experience with. I live on planet Earth, so of course I've had a beef patty before, but the coco bread combination was novel to me. I was surprised to see that it's simply a patty sandwiched between warm coco bread. Though I appreciate the simplicity, my health conscious side had trouble not thinking about the seemingly needless carbohydrate explosion. Anyway, it was tasty.

I'm a fan of what these guys are doing. They bring Jamaican-jerk food to south Markham in a good way."}
{"text":"Came back for round two but they were sold out of BOTH goat curry and chicken roti which was very disappointing :(

Despite that, we didn't want to drive elsewhere so we settled for the ox tail dinner ($13.95) and jerk chicken dinner ($8.75). It was awesome that both of the meats were tender and juicy but the overall flavour of the sauces were a little lacking. Definitely incomparable to the deliciousness of the curry dishes. 

My verdict is that I would come back for the goat curry but if they're sold out again, I'd suck it up and just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Oh WOW! Finally found a Jamaican place that doesn't rely heavily on salt for their main seasoning.

Tiny hole in the wall take out joint that fits four adults in the front part of the room, the kitchen takes up the rest. Friendly laid back staff that makes you feel welcomed. Lots of affordable meals, daily and lunch specials as well. 

ORDERED:
- Jerk chicken lunch special that comes with coleslaw and rice and peas. Love, love, loved their blend of spices: nice balance between sweet and spicy. The chicken was tender, rice soft and coleslaw crunchy.
- Jerk pork sandwich - the jerk pork was ok but I loved the soft coco bun that it was served in.
- Bottled drink with Soursop and Basil seeds - a little sweet for my taste and not enough sour. The seeds added interesting texture.

Will definitely be back to take advantage of their delicious food at cheap, cheap prices."}
{"text":"Summary: simple takeout spot has some of the best chicken sandwiches and coco bread I've ever tried, but wait times can get long, and the other dishes are not as mouth-wateringly delicious

Top Must-Get: chicken sandwich
Top Regret: jerk pork

Located right beside KFC and down the road from Popeye's - it says a lot that this small takeout place still gets lineups for its chicken. It's a cramped space - you sort of just bunch up in the best line you can make when it's busy, and then order at the window. It can be a long wait since it's a small shop, but during down times, it's fairly efficient.

Their chicken sandwich meat is stripped right off the leg of a chicken, and it is absurdly tender and tasty. I get it without the coleslaw so that nothing detracts from the juicy chicken taste, properly flavoured, as I bite into it. Delicious.

They also have superior coco bread than other local Jamaican places - it's got a tinge of sweetness that just tickles the tastebuds right, and it's noticably less dry than others.

However, their jerk pork is missing the same legendary calling of their chicken. I also think their patties are comparable to supermarket-bought ones, so they aren't necessarily amazing (although not bad either - I have had the patty in coco bread a few times!)

The other dishes are decent if not spectacular. I recall feeling a bit let down at their dinner portions: a hefty amount of rice, but not a proportionate amount of meat.

That said, it's worth a visit if only for their chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"They stayed open an extra 10mins , as I was late picking up my takeout. The guy was very friendly. I am so happy he did stay open, I ordered jerk chicken. It's delicious !! The meat falls off the bone, it's nice and juicy. Perfectly spiced. I would definitely recommend getting your jerk chicken here!  so pleased."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of my friend, I decided to check this place out.  He has been going to this place since it opened 14 years ago, and he swears that it is the best jerk chicken he has had.

I introduced him to my favorite spot, the Ritz at Yonge & Carlton, which he quite enjoyed, but he said that he still liked his spot better.  Well, that to me was a challenge, and I had to try his spot.  The guy at the counter was super friendly, and asked in his Jamaican accent, ever so politely, if I liked my chicken \"a little spicy\".  A big smile burst across my face, and I said \"most definitely\", and asked him not to hold back on the \"pepper sauce\" (which my friend told me was an inside joke that he had going with the owner).

Now the Jerk here is quite good.  It's very smokey, tender and tasty.  My mom tried a piece and wondered out loud how they get the pieces so tender and flavorful.  I definitely enjoyed the chicken, but will I say that it is better than my old standby, nope... not quite.  

So after trying the meal, I decided to discuss the finer points of Jerk Chicken with my friend.  We came to the conclusion that there may be two (or possibly more) styles of jerk chicken: the more barbeque-esque, juicy, fall of your bone (which the Ritz gets to perfection) and the more smokey, dry but still flavorful variety (which Negril seems to nail).  It was the only way we could see eye-to-eye."}
{"text":"Nigril Jerk restaurant is a very simple take out restaurant. 

A few things that you have the note about this place is that if you're used to traditional Jamaican food this is not the place to go they have a different spin on the Jamaican. 

There jerk chicken is more like fricassee chicken. It's not the traditional dry dry rub space jerk chicken. It comes very moist and cut up in smaller pieces. 

There oxtail is particularly good too

The best thing about this place is there coleslaw hands-down it's the best coleslaw I've ever had in my whole life."}
{"text":"I was having a Jamaican food craving for weeks, so was happy to finally find a night where I could have some. I had the curry goat dinner. It was decent but I didn't love it, which was especially disappointing because I'd been craving it for so long.  The rice was a regular rice, rather than rice and peas, which I expected. I would definitely give this place another chance to redeem itself. Will post an update when I do. 

My friend had the chicken fried rice which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Best jerk in markham in my opinion. The chicken and pork is always moist and full of flavour. Always make a couple visits a week"}
{"text":"\"Jerk\"....the word can have so many connotations...sudden start and stop motion, a total a**hole...but in terms of food, \"jerk\" means delicious Jamaican food baby!!

Negril Jerk Food is a tiny take out spot that serves some serious Jamaican fare such as oxtail, rotis, patties and of course the aforementioned jerk chicken.

The food is really good here.  I ordered the large jerk chicken dinner extra spicy which comes with the chicken, rice and peas and coleslaw.  Its was fantastic as the chicken was tender slathered in scotch bonnet sauce, the rice moist and flavorful and the coleslaw itself was a standout with great flavour and texture.  The only thing I find is that like most Jamaican places is that their extra spicy is not spicy but then again I'm a chili freak:)

The place is just a takeout joint that holds 4 people standing (no seating) with most of the space dedicated to the kitchen.

Service was very friendly and seems a lot of people call in to avoid the wait.  

Highly recommended for some good traditional Jamaican fare!!

4/5!  Well done!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this roti place for over a decade. It is crazy that I have not written about this place until now.

Recently, I was working from home and wanted something different. Instead of what I normally do, which is fix some lunch and go back to slaving away over my laptop, I went out to Negril Jerk Food and got some food to go.

My go-to order is the chicken roti. This place gives you a ton of chicken and potatoes stew carefully wrapped in a roti. The roti is soft and perfectly made, with the dahl puri showing up to the party of yumminess. It is simply tasty.

I like the beef roti, too. However, I love the chicken more. Again, this place does not skimp on ingredients, no matter what type of roti you order.

A few years ago, I brought my then-colleague-turned-good-friend to this eatery for lunch. We picked up our food and went back to the office to eat it. He is a Trini. He ordered my favourite roti and said that it was outstanding. He is a foodie. We both can't be wrong.

I recommend getting our Caribbean food kick here.

{"text":"YAY.

Honestly, we came into this plaza because we saw the KFC sign and my boyfriend and I were too sick of arguing of where we should eat.
Am I ever glad we found Negril.

It's a very small and simple takeout place just at the corner of the plaza. The parking is not a problem as several stores have shut down.

I LOVE their food. I love their coco bread and the Jamaican patty omg :) the bread is fresh and soft and their patty is so flavourful.

I believe my boyfriend got the jerk chicken with rice and peas. Yes. Yes. Yes. They gave us the bottom filled with rice and the top with chicken. The chicken was slightly spicy and tender. Their rice was spicy and well-cooked.  The coleslaw was creamy and fresh.

I will return when I'm craving Carribean food again."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood takeout. We had the jerk chicken sandwich which was excellent with an oxtail dinner which was very good, and some pepper pot soup to help counter the cold. The soup was perfect- made with excellent vegetables and spices and amazing taste. 

I tried the mango drink with basil seeds - of was a great palette cleanser. 

I called ahead so service was fast and very helpful.  (they're closed Sundays)."}
{"text":"Negril Jerk Food is a really hole in the wall take out restaurant.  Yes there is really a hole where you place your order and you can see them preparing your food in that hole.

From outside Negril Jerk Food looks a little sketchy but when I went inside though the place is nice and sparkling clean.  This take out joint is runned by a nice friendly Jamaican family with really simple menu.

They do have daily specials which changes everyday. I decide on the half Jerk Chicken Combo ($6.25) and Curry Chicken Roti ($6.95) extra spicy. The food was packed in hot dog look alike containers and off I go in 10 minute.

The Jerk Chicken is so nice and tender and juicy. I think it taste more like the Chinese style soya chicken and brushed with hot jerk sauce. The chicken just fall off the bones when I was eating that.. and the rice with peas was great. I finished the whole order by myself and I was happy.

For the Chicken Roti, I shared with my coworker 2 hours later. It is still warm in the foam container, but I decide to heat that up in the microwave for 1 min. We both love the roti. The chicken is perfectly cooked so really tender with a great mix of chuncky potatoes. It has just enough curry sauce but not overflowing with it. The roti wrapping itself is great too, no funny flourly taste and not thick just perfect to pick it up and eat as a wrap. The spiciness is just perfect for my taste too.

We both agree that the roti tasted better than the one we have at Real Jerk a few weeks ago!!

I would definitely be back to try out others food in the menu or getting the daily specials.

They accepts Debit with 50 cents surcharges."}
{"text":"This place is close to home and I love roti so I sometimes drop by. They have beef roti on the menu, but they never have it available so I get the chicken. It's still really good. I wasn't crazy about the jerk chicken the one time I tried it, but at the same time it wasn't too bad. I remember it being on pretty dry and not spicy enough for my liking."}
{"text":"Our always go-to Jamaican spot in Markham/Denison area since its so close to home and never dissapoints. We always order the large jerk chicken and large oxtail dinner. They serve it NOT spicy so if u like hot, u have to ask for it to be put on or on the side.

The price and portion size is fair and its just good quality, tasty food."}
