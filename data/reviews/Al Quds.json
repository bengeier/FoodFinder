{"text":"TAKE OUT ONLY....

Saw their flyer and decided to give a try...so far their mix plate turned out to be the #1.

Quality of the food is OK not he the superior but price is also similar to the food.

Customer service is OK....good arabic take out place compared to others around that area...

Been a frequent customer for the past few months....."}
{"text":"Have ordered twice now- I'm very satisfied with the food and price.   Ordered the shish taouk plate and the filet mignon plate.  The rice was not tasteless, the salad was fresh, and the sauce portions were generous (hummus and garlic sauce).   French fries were a little underdone.  The meat portions could have been bigger, but it's understandable with meat prices these days.  I think the price was right.   Delivery guy also very friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE! The rice has no taste at all, the meat is served cold and the salad is disgusting. If you order fries, the small one costs 3$ and that too is served cold. And, it's all expensive for nothing. Most importantly, you will freeze to death if you sit inside the restaurant to eat. They don't turn on the heater and go around in big coats and hats themselves. Worst experience ever. You want kabab and grillades, go to Farhat on chemin cote des neiges."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and it's awesome!!! We ordered Al Quds Mix and 30 wings and boy we weren't disappointed. The portions were huge, very generous and everything was cooked to perfection. I don't usually like Arabic food but the food here had great taste, same thing for the wings, they were tender, juicy and delicious. Very satisfied with this place and the price just can't be beat."}
