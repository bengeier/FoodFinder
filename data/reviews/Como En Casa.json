{"text":"What a great meal.  My family of 4, including a fussy 10 yr old enjoyed wonderful service (it was quiet when we ordered so that helped) and lovely tasty food.  We paid $100 incl of tip and could not complain about anything.  Great quesadilla, tacos, guacamole and our first taste of cactus (other than prior tequila  ).  A lovely surprise as this was not our first choice but we will struggle to top this dinner during our short stay in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is the freshest you'll find. None of that cheap meat soaked in sauce or spices to hide the fact that it's poor quality there. The owners are a pure delight. They really do take pride in what they are serving you - that itself is refreshing! And the place is spotless."}
{"text":"This is pretty good! I tried the guac, some different taco flavors, and the 3 milk cake. The 3 milk cake was disappointing, it had a weird gas station coffee creamer flavor but good texture. The guac was fine, but I've made tastier at home. The homemade tortilla chips were nice.

The beef taco, however, was AMAZING. I'll be back for more of this."}
{"text":"Expensive and small portions. It seems this place used to be better before they raised the prices."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service from who I assume to be the manager, who made a mistake with our order (gave us chicken enchiladas instead of vegetarian) and then immediately raised his voice with us saying there was \"nothing he could do.\" He then proceeded to bring out his employee and attempt to blame him for the incident. Another member of our party had the wrong toppings on his burrito, but we didn't even say anything to avoid dealing with this manager again. Ingredients tasted cheap and enchiladas were cold. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Good food, good prices. Pork tacos were the tastiest. Tres leches cake was very nice too."}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive, delicious Mexican food in a warm, no-frills environment. Fresh ingredients. A great lunch or quick dinner. Friendly staff.

The tacos are finished with a quick grill leaving the flour tortillas warm and nicely crisp. The quesadilla is stuffed with peppers, onion, refried beans, and lettuce along with the regular meat and cheese."}
{"text":"Did someone say Guacamole???? 
I wish I didn't live so close to this place, honestly my jeans are tight! 
My Mexican friend introduced me to this restaurant, it's the only Mexican place he enjoys. It isn't fancy or extravagant but I love it. I usually go with the Taco meal deal, two tacos, rice and beans and salsa plus a side order of guacamoooollllleeeeee! 
Great value, great food, great staff!"}
{"text":"Food just ok. Cute place but cafeteria style, go up and order, pay before you sit and eat, get your own cutlery etc. Asked for a small special order and was shut down. No can-do-attitude. Guy was on his computer and refused to help me. Will never come back! Don't bother with this place"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and very authentic.  I would definitely go there again next time in Toronto.  Small place but clean and the owner was adorable."}
{"text":"I love the service here because everyone is warm and friendly, which is always worth a trip back, just to hear a story about Mexico.

I had the pazole which is only offered Friday evenings and on Saturdays - delicious mix of braised pork and corn in a soup - a really hearty meal! Their sweet empanadas looked really delicious, but alas, I was too full to even pop in dessert.

Highly recommend this place if you like great service and affordable meals that actually fill you up."}
{"text":"I had a chicken burrito and my boyfriend had the fish tacos - they were both excellent! I also had the horchata, however it was not the best I've had. This is a cozy, small restaurant with a great vibe. Either way, I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Owner's from Guadalajara, I am from Guadalajara, he cooks like my mom and I love my mom's food so it was easy to fall in love with this place and its authenticity."}
{"text":"I adore this place. The service is excellent, sooo friendly every time! The food has me stuffed, and yet I find myself placing one order to go before I leave... Just in case I'm hungry later... Extra guacamole please. I've tried the fish tacos and all of their sides. The refried beans are the best I've had, I'm fairly certain I could eat a plate of only refried beans here. I also ordered (and regret not taking a picture) the daily special, which was chipotle meatballs and sides. It was awesome. If you're unsure what to order ask the staff- I haven't been steered wrong."}
{"text":"I complain a lot about service in Toronto. I usually find it terrible and wander how others in the city put up with it.

The staff here are excellent. They give attention to every customer, are friendly and keep things moving. I also noticed they were helping some customers with learning Spanish which I thought was nice.

The food however was pretty standard. I got the chicken taco meal. It came with a large portion of beans and rice, but I was hungry after. It did not satisfy my fatness.

Overall I would not go out of my way to go to this place again unless I am in the area. The staff get a 5/5 though."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, you feel like you're in mexico, very friendly staff, fast service, very clean and the food is very authentic and full of flavour, big portions and priced well, would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I had the Taco Meal which consists of 2 tacos, beans, and rice for $6.99 - The tacos had a fantastic and aromatic flavor to it and the rice and beans were also very good! 

The food was 5/5 stars. The only thing holding this review back from being 5/5 stars was the price. I wish it were cheaper but I guess thats Toronto for you..."}
{"text":"Super sweet service, and bright and cheerful interior. I tried their tacos and can't quite understand the rave reviews. First, ONLY the fish tacos come on corn tortillas. The other tacos come on wheat tortillas and are grilled like quesadillas. It's kind of weird to have grill marks on tacos. They were tasty, but nothing amazing. Pork and chicken tacos are served with refried beans and rice. Again, good, but nothing amazing. I think possibly the fish taco platter is the way to go, since it uses corn tortillas and served with lime, along with salad and rice."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS AUTHENTICA
Love the Mole (wasnt too sweet), the Tacos and the rice too.. I am going back this coming week to try more. I will eat here again an again"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. 
Large portions. 
Excellent staff. 
Low price."}
{"text":"First time here.  
Service polite and quick. 
Fish tacos are amazing. 
Be careful their salsa can be very spicey. I tried extra hot. 
Price was decent as well. 

Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We live close by and so have come to gotten to know this place pretty well.  Husband has always gotten the quesadilla (HUGE and very cheesy) while I've recently tried the chicken tamales.

My husband asks for a mixture of chicken and pork in his quesadilla and the staff are always more than happy to put both meats in there for him.  

I haven't had a lot of tamales in my lifetime, but just based on taste, I found the chicken tamales to be very fresh tasting and tasty.  The tamale meal comes with 2 tamales and a choice of rice or beans.  I ask for half-and-half and again, the staff are happy to accommodate.

Great little casual place with very friendly staff and attentive service (especially for a place that doesn't have waiter service!)"}
{"text":"Whoa. I've had me some Mexican in Toronto, but Como En Casa which moved in May 2012, has now topped the charts.

Had the amazing Abodo chicken, and got guac on the side -- definitely the best guac I've had.

Everything is 100% fresh, tasty, cheap, healthy.

The owner/chef came & talked to us while we were eating and was a really nice dude-- lots of pride in his meals. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered a grande Beef Burrito for $9.55 and final price was more expensive than that.  Turned out I said yes when the staff asked if I want Guacamole which is extra $1.50 (he didn't mention it costs extra).  The staff gave me an option to \"unselect\" the Guacamole, so I did.  The burrito turned out to be average and not worth the price at all.  What's worse is, it said on the menu the burrito is supposed to be a 10\" long, but it's more like 6\".  What a rip off.  I would suggest going to Burrito Bandidos close by which is cheaper and offers more choices."}
{"text":"Consistently mediocre. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but I'm happy to grab lunch from time to time without disappointment."}
{"text":"First thing, the staff! OMG! So so friendly and helpful! :)

Being vegetarian sometimes exposes you to the boring side of any cuisine but Como En Casa surpassed my expectations!
I had the vegetarian quesadilla and diablo potatoes...absolutely delicious! The warm tortilla was stuffed with cheese, beans, veges, and soft sweet potatoes - this along with some hot salsa and sour cream was a heavenly combo. And the portions are HUGE and totally worth the price!

I liked the sauce on the diablo potatoes but they were essentially just whole boiled potatoes so as soon as you went past the skin, it was essentially a mouthful of bland boiled potato! Maybe if they cut the potatoes into cubes, the sauce would evenly cover everything? 

Anyway, totally recommend this place! =)"}
{"text":"Popped in here to grab some lunch while out walking in the area.  My friend and I split the taco lunch with one veggie and one chicken.  We also ordered salsa and chips and a sweet empanada.  In addition to a Modella the bill was only $18 which is a great price.   The food was delicious and the staff very kind.  They took the time to explain the food and when we asked about the sweet empanada the owner talked to us about back home in Mexico the churches serving sweet empanadas at Easter time.   It was a nice story to go alongside and amazing tasting treat.  The food was spiced well and very flavourful.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I found this unassuming place almost by accident.  I am so happy I walked in and gave it a try.  It is our go to place for Mexican food cravings.  My go to order is the beef tacos with the side salad.  The meat is tender and everything is perfectly seasoned.  The owner is friendly, personable and seems to genuinely love what he does -which may explain why they have stood the test of time.  The quality of the food and service has been consistently great and I look forward to eating here again...and again."}
{"text":"I've now been to Como En Casa twice and I'm thoroughly impressed by their traditional Mexian offerings. Unfortunately they can't get the same quality ingredients that they would be able to get easily (and cheaply) in Mexico, but they do the best with what they've got.

Tacos
A solid taco with good flavour. Definitely try the veggie, even if you're a proud carnivore like me. It has cactus in it!

Burrito
Good, but pretty basic. Nothing really stood out, but it was nice and filling.

I'm excited to try the tamales and empanadas soon.

The owners are a real treat. They're super friendly, helpful with the menu, and will share stories about Mexico with you. I had a history lesson on native Mexicans who travel across the desert of the country only eating cactus and peyote. The cactus is the same one that they use in their veggie options. Peyote isn't on the menu..."}
{"text":"Salt blast. Everything tasted great, but afterwards we had to chug down a lot of water to counter the salt. Had 2 dinner set, one beef, one pork. Both delicious. Fish tacos were well seasoned. The quesadilla was huge and welll worth the price.

Overall: Excellent service, large portioned and flavourful food. Only problem is the salty aftertaste."}
{"text":"I first found out about this place from a friend of a friend who brought some empanadas and a tres leches cake to a get together. The food was so good that I had to go try it out. The price is really good too, and the service is the kind that actually makes you feel at home. I've had the pozole and the tamales, and I will be trying the chicken adobo next. I have returned quite a few times, and will continue to do so. 

I agree with a previous reviewer's comment that it is \"down-home-honest-to-god Mexican food\". I went there with a group of teens visiting from Mexico and they liked it so much that they asked to go back to \"their casa\"! 

If you are in the Yonge and Wellesley area, do go check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food, good value & nicely unpretentious. Very friendly staff - went on strength of other reviews and wasn't disappointed. Hygiene very slightly grungy but it caters for the student community so they probably don't mind ;)"}
{"text":"Wanna eat good Taco's in Toronto?
Check this out. Great Taco's,especially with chicken. If you wanna eat good,fast and cheap,
go here"}
{"text":"Tried the taco meal for just under 10$. The food was good and tasted good but the portions weren't the best. It was two pretty small tacos and a little bit of rice. They didn't have that much options either. I would probably not come here again as the stores near by are better."}
{"text":"My grandmother is known for her fantastic cooking. It's fresh, simple and delicious. And if she was from Mexico, this is he kind of food she would cook! It feels authentic, and they do their own thing. Sure, they have burritos on the menu just like everyone else, but also kick-ass meatballs, daily specials and my personal favourite, tamales! The staff is friendly and when it comes to food, whatever they recommend, I try. Haven't gone wrong yet :)"}
{"text":"For $6.99 I had a Taco Meal - which consisted of 2 small chicken soft-shell tacos, rice, and refried beans. You get a side of fresh salsa.

The meal was very delightful. Full of flavor, and freshly prepared.

If you are a fan of real mexican food, I recommend this place. For $6.99, you can't complain. Definitely will come here again!!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place was quite nice. It seemed authentic (I got the tamal, which is pretty hard to find), although I've never actually eaten in Mexico.  It was a nice portion size, good service,super fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious.
Warm and friendly owners.
Very reasonably-priced.
And some of the tastiest guac I've ever sunk my chomps into.

Yonge Street dining has been saved!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food - I usually get the taco rice combo, served with beans and a side salsa. But I've had the burrito as well which was super. Really good vibe and very cool decor. The owners - Carlos and Fernando - are super friendly as are the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"The only Mexican place where you can eat every single day. So many options and the guys are great. Tacos are perfectly cooked.

Solid solid choice for a fantastic lunch"}
{"text":"the menu is more diverse than i expected, with different stews, a chicken mole, as well as tacos, tamales, etc. the food was delicious and fresh. the prices are very reasonable. the staff was very friendly. it has a nice big front window that's opened in summer, so even if you sit inside, there's nice fresh air."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food for reasonable prices.

The guacamole is a MUST try. The tomatillos in it give it a great taste. Had the Adobo chicken - Not the best I've had but the sauce was good. Found the chicken to be a little dry. The pork 'Como En Casa' dinner was delish though. 

Staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Good, simple Mexiacn. Tacos are worth repeat visits and the carne and rice dinner specials are tasty and large portioned and come with sides for $10. Prices are low, excellent value, prompt service. Licensed too. The go to for Mexican on Yonge."}
{"text":"Authentic. Wholesome. Good quality. Como en casa is unlike the many fusion Mexican and pseudo-Mexican joints in Toronto. This is the real deal! Very fairly priced and tastes fresh and amazing, how Mexican food is supposed to be. Try out the pork items like Pork Verde, I personally do not prefer pork over beef and chicken at most places but here, it is godly. The guac is also delicious!"}
{"text":"I ate a chicken burrito 2 hours ago and I'm still thinking about how amazing it was."}
{"text":"Had guac + chips and chicken mole meal today. Service was on top and the food was great. Loved their guacamole! Ill def try their tacos next time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, people & atmosphere are so friendly. Of course the food is so good!  I had the Casa Dinner Plate, which is a little of everything with choice of beef, chicken,pork or veggie. It was amazing filled me up and I'm a pretty big eater. Everything here is made fresh and is tasty you can taste the freshness! I also has the lentil soup which was pretty good as well, took 6 sweet empanadas to go and they were tasty!"}
{"text":"Because of my pickiness with food & certain food sensitivities, coupled with the fact that I cook a great deal myself, I have but a few restaurants that I have discovered to actually like, especially in this city. I tend to cook my own dishes but once or twice a week, I like to experience 'really good quality food (not mediocre, not over priced).  So, if I write about something I like, I write with conviction. 

Just north of Wellesley on the east side, Como en Casa is a colourful abyss of yellow, orange, red and personality, both in food and people. The minute you enter this little restaurant, you are taken away from the hectic city greys. The music, colours and ambiance transport you out of the City of Toronto, even for a short period, and you experience a little bit of Mexico and its tasty dishes. The artwork on the walls are a showcase of local artists while adding a touch of Latin flavour to the décor.

The two owners, named 'Carlos and Fernando' have done well to present 'Mexican Restaurant quality' in an open faster service-sit down and eat' environment. The combination of the two owners having a love for cooking and the experience of dealing with clients in a 'customer service oriented' environment is what makes the place both inviting and the food even tastier. After more than a year of going to the restaurant, neither taste nor service has waned. The key word: consistency. We have gotten to know the owners as well as their food, quite well.

The restaurant begins their day from 0700h in food preparation. So for the review I read regarding what ingredient has no onions? If you prefer that style of special catering, it is best you go to a fine dining Mexican restaurant. 

Tamales which are made from scratch where they grind their own corn. Presently they offer the tamales in veg and chicken. I thought the Tamales were phenomenal. However, to ensure that I was not being biased, I brought in a very good friend, originally from the Central American region, who loves tamales and I know would be bluntly honest. It was quite a hit!. He could not believe how close it tasted to 'just like back home'. If you do order it, make sure you have the hotter salsa, the 'green salsa' with it. It seems to make the flavours of the tamales 'pop'.

The quesadilla is about the size of the plate, grill pressed after filling it generously with all the goodies. It is nothing like the restaurants down and up the street from this locale; it is even bigger, better and more to the point, tastier! The Burrito, just like the Quesadilla, is offered both in white or whole wheat wrap. The Burritos are Huge, filling, tasty and hefty in your tummy, but not in your pocket. You choose: Grande or MAS Grande.

I would have to say that my favourite was definitely the Mexican Chicken Adobo. The chicken is always tender and tasty, the sauce is absolutely savoury and complemented with a side of rice, beans and your choice of Salsa. Unfortunately, at the time or writing, they have taken it off their menu. The lack of consistency from the butchers prevents them from even serving it to their customers. As they put it, they cannot charge their customers for tiny pieces of chicken they receive.

Their empanadas were so tasty but also taken off the menu. Unfortunately, it was not a huge hit with the majority. But they did introduce Fish tacos. It is very simple in taste, but the coleslaw added on top is what gives it that latin flavour.

While their stews can really warm you  and your taste buds up in the winter, I gravitate to the \"Casa Plate Dinner\" with a cervesa (beer) during the summer months.  It is the next best place in the area if you cannot have home cooked food.

I have had them cater for me in the past and also order cakes for parties. It is always a hit!

Fernando and Carlos not only focus on taste, but presentation, customer service and customer satisfaction. They stick true to the information they provide on their website: http://www.comoencasa.ca/who-we-are/

\"As a Latin place, we serve up fresh food rich in colors, aromas and textures.As a Toronto restaurant, we offer our customers food that fits their budget, lifestyle and hectic schedule. Not only is our food healthy and quick, we also have some amazing deals!\"

Is it worth your visit? ABSOLUTELY.
What TO bring? A smile and a hungry stomach.
How do you order & what to expect? 
(1) When walking in, don't miss out on the board on the right side wall. It shows the specials. 
(2) Find a seat and put your extra baggage down. It can get busy during the rush hours and seats can go quickly
(3) If the board's daily specials don't intrigue you,  walk towards the cash counter with the sign hanging above. 
(4) Expect to be greeted by someone. 
(5) Look around and order whatever gets your mouth running. 
(5)Place your order to include your choice of drink
(6) If it is busy, they will give you a number which you take with you.
(7) Grab your cutlerly and drink. Wait, eat enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best dishes I have had in Toronto (and with such a sweet, friendly staff too!)  Everyone should check this place out."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some Mexican food and decided to give place a try. I was not disappointed whatsoever. The enchiladas verde was very flavorful and the Fish Taco meal was clean and fresh with a side salad, guacamole and rice. Glad I finally decided to walk in and look forward to exploring the menu next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"***4.5 Stars***

Como En Casa is a hidden gem on Yonge Street just north of Wellesley.  This place has authentic Mexican fare from recipes of the owner's family.  The fish tacos were fabulous, my SO went back for seconds!  The Three Milk Cake is delicious; I could have had a whole cake to myself.

I highly recommend Como En Casa if you are ever in the area.  This is a stand out place with all the food choices in the area."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the service is friendly, and the portions are a decent size. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican in the heart of downtown. This is not your typical Mexican style restaurant experience. Like a fast food Mexican diner. Always great! Try the horchata!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. I come back over and over again. They keep updating their restaurant which makes it cozier each time. Love the colour and music , great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty burrito, worth a try! Loved the roasted veggies and gauc"}
{"text":"Its delicious i came with my friends and everybody liked it :) deliciousssssssss the guys are tqlking spanish with you if you want and you can be sure you are at the true adress my favourite of course middle hot spice keep your mouth hahaha"}
{"text":"We were in the area and hopped in for early dinner. Since Mr. h and i were in the mood for tacos we ordered the chicken and fish tacos, along with two drinks (freshly made). The chicken tacos was ok, not great and the fish was better but not awesome. The food tasted very fresh but nothing made me want to come back to have more. Also it cost $27 total and if I were hungry when I came in  would not be satisfied unless I ordered a taco combo with rice. 

The service was good and the food was served very quickly. But if I'm going to pay so much, I'd rather go to Kensington Avenue for tacos since it tastes better."}
{"text":"I'm floored at how this place has good reviews. Popped in for a lunchtime meal and I'm having major regrets. My family is Latin American and my boyfriend with the same roots agrees that this is probably the worst Mexican joint we've ever been to.

Guac is way too liquidy, the food is made with low quality ingredients and you can taste it! Won't be back"}
{"text":"If you do not think this is the best burrito you've had outside of Mexico, I question your sanity and your taste buds.  The staff is so friendly, the food is phenomenal and the apple pop...perfection!"}
{"text":"I came by with my friend last night for dinner. We got the Chicken Quesadilla, Fish Taco Meal, Tortilla & Salsa and two drinks. Our total came up to almost $30. We ordered the guacamole at first and he charged us then he said the guacamole isn't fresh so they don't make it but then other people got it? And my friend's meal came up a side of guacamole as well...?

The Chicken Quesadilla was good. Super stuffed with filling, literally bursting out of the tortilla and it was fresh and hot - I liked it. We asked for it to be spicy... not spicy at all. My friend didn't want onions, they still put onions.

The Fish Taco was so pathetic. My \"fried\" fish was cold and soggy - clearly pre-fried. Also, the veggies on the fish taco - pickled onion tasted gross and I usually love pickled anything and onion everything and the coleslaw on it was so sad, soggy mess. Please do yourself a favour and don't get this. The rice and salad on the side wasn't any good either. Rice lacked so much flavour. I also asked for my meal to be spicy... but no spice at all.

The salsa was the dinkiest thing I've ever seen. It's like a shot of salsa... the tortilla chips were good though.

Overall, I was very disappointed with this place.. it had such good reviews so I had high expectations. I would not come back."}
{"text":"First time visiting and damn the food was delicious!!! Will go back again!!! Good price, nice people working and relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. It was pricey and the food was mediocre. We got two dishes and it came to $40 after taxes and tip. The enchilada was not authentic, and the meat inside was very bland. The beef stew was chewy. I've been to much better Mexican restaurants, that are also cheaper. I grew up in latinoamerica and I've eaten many homemade meals at Mexican friends' homes, and this food didn't taste como en casa."}
{"text":"Stumbling across this homey and inviting Mexican restaurant while strolling along Yonge Street, it ended up to be a very pleasant surprise! 

Pros:
- Delicious chicken quesadilla, with plenty of chicken, cheese, vegetables, and sauce. Piping hot and fresh, and a generous portion size. Loved the small cups of guacamole, salsa, and sour cream on the side. Very flavourful, and filling. Yum!!
- Staff are very friendly, and polite.
- Atmosphere is very warm and charming. The music is lively, and the carnation in a beer bottle on our table is a nice touch. 

Cons:
- Self serve component was a bit awkward. You have to pour your own water from a pitcher and get your own cutlery at a small station located near the cash register.
- Restaurant can feel cramped, and difficult to maneuver between the tables. 

Overall a great experience, and very tasty Mexican food made with love. Will definitely be returning here with my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Pre-ordered lunch for 10 people and went to pick up the food. The order was very messed up. I had to go over each dish with them to make sure all the dishes were there. One whole platter was missing but they made it quickly. Note to anyone who orders by phone - get them to repeat and double check any big orders. But the food was wonderful! Authentic and flavourful and great portions. I ordered the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and was very happy. Everyone else enjoyed what they ordered. Would definitely eat here again. One other thing to note: the place is tiny so I would only suggest dining in if you're one or two people."}
{"text":"Wow, this is one of only two Mexican places in the city that I actually, really like (the other being upscale and less traditional).

The service has been excellent every time I have come here and the food is fantastic! It's real down-home honest-to-god Mexican food -- something that I was surprised to find can be hard to come by in this city. Everything is very fresh, made with TLC and home-style care, and is a killer value, being quite cheap for quite a lot. Bang for your buck is excellent.

Since first wandering in on a whim a few months back, we've returned many times. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a small, casual Mexican fast food on yonge. I had a taco platter. The sauce was good but the taco wasnt memorable. The platter came with rice and beans."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant; it's perfect for lunch. A small number of tables to dine in, but very cozy. Friendly staff and fast service.

I had the chicken burrito and was very impressed. It's a bit pricier than some nearby options, but quality incredients and great flavours! I'll return to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for some good and authentic Mexican food. I love getting the verde enchiladas. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are pretty good...could eat five of them.  They come on a corn tortilla with coleslaw and fresh salsa.  They also give you a side salsa of hot medium or mild.  They use basa fish...which is on the cheaper side but tastes great and keeps the price down @ $4 a taco.  Would be nice with some cilantro and a fresh piece of lime to squeeze on the fish.  Very friendly staff or owner taking the orders which gives them an extra star."}
{"text":"Very nice little homely place. Great authentic Mexican food with large servings and full of flavor"}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal of chicken mole and horchata. The chicken was fall off the bone tender,  and the mole sauce gave a subtle hint of cocoa. Never tried a horchata till this meal and loved the blend of rice and almonds.  Overall,  this place has friendly staff and big portions for the price.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Mi casa es su casa - truer words have never been spoken about a restaurant. It was a cold and rainy day when we stopped in for dinner here and we were immediately welcomed with such warmth. The person at the register, who I think may have been the owner, was such a gentleman. He thanked us for coming and suggested a couple dishes that were popular. I went with the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce with a side of rice for $11.50. The food was served promptly and was delicious and filling. 

I couldn't leave without trying their dulce de leche empanadas - OH. MA. GAWD. To die for. I only got one because I don't think I could have saved this for later. Only $1.50 a piece and so worth it. 

The staff here is fantastic. You can tell they really care about the customers and the food. Everything is made in house from scratch. 

If you're looking for a quick plate of homemade food, this is the place to go. And, grab an empanada to go, but I guarantee you won't make it out the door with it."}
{"text":"I cant say a single bad thing about this place! The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The food is tasty, fresh and authentic.  The menu is priced well.  You can even grab a cerveza with your meal,... what more could one ask for?

This is an excellent place to grab a bite! I would definitely recommend it.  

Personal fav: Pork tacos (yummm)"}
{"text":"This was awesome food, very friendly staff. Have been around for 3 yrs , I asked. I ordered the 2 taco special and it tasted like MORE :) The Salsa has a bit of a kick to it, and just the right amount of garlic in the guacamole . Next time I go downtown I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"The dinner plate and chicken mole was wonderful the drink was refreshing and the staff was friendly.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Small sit down Mexican restaurant. You order and pay at the counter and they bring the food to your table when it's ready. Friendly staff but food is a bit pricey. I got the two fish tacos meal and chips and salsa. The tacos were ok but I have had better. The chips and salsa are made in house and very tasty however the portion was a bit on the small side. Ok place to go if you are in the area and craving Mexican but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! It's in a cute and very old building, but they make it their own. Great location on Yonge Street, too. Go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a fish taco snack to try their food here since so many good reviews. 
This place is mostly self serve cause kitchen staff did everything from preparing to cashier to serving. 
I ordered a fish taco to try and I asked for spicy. The fry fish was still soft inside n outside maybe left it there for longer time. 
Normally would fry it again before serving. 
Is not spicy at all and the sauce on the side is like tasteless. 
Next time will try their other rice meal. 
This taco is only worth 2 stars."}
{"text":"Tried based on Yelp. Good value and tasty dishes. Fresh prepared and friendly service (and a chat about our long ago visit to Mexico).

We had the beef quesadilla and the chicken mole and we were both quite happy. Shredded beef and fresh cooked chicken were the base. The medium salsa had a decent kick, and they also gave a green hot salsa that may have been a bit hotter. The guacamole on the side got a thumbs up, too.  For drinks it was the Jarritos lime sodas. All good. We'll probably come back to try the fish tacos next time."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch joint. 

Somewhat authentic, mostly TexMex influenced and so-so Mexican. 
Actually, I think a lot of rustic and authentic Mexican cuisine would not sell too well in Canada and at least not at this price point. If you want to try a more authentic Mexican cuisine experience then try Rebozos -- although they, Rebozos are a bit overpriced and getting there is a pain in the neck.  

Anyway, Como En Casa is reasonably priced, small place and I can see it being popular with the nearby office workers and the lunch hour crowd here. When I got there it was empty by the time I left --well into the lunch hour-- it was packed.

People who run the place are friendly and helpful. If you want to try something aside the boatloads of Asian places littered around the hood, then give it a try. 

They get extra points for the fact of where they are located as they are a welcome contrast to what is around, but in the end, it is a fast, cafeteria styled food and setting, like a Quiznos or Subway."}
{"text":"The only thing here you should get is the chicken mole. 
It is legit- best in the city.
I've tried a lot of mole and this one is a nice thick chocolatey bitter flavour- not watered down like EVERY other mexican place in Kensington (seriously-- I went to 3 different places in Kensington and all their mole was just sad and watered down)."}
{"text":"Delicious food with great price and very friendly service! I went with a couple friends for a quick bite and it was perfect. I wouldn't dine in as a big group (limited space and seating) although the tables were rearranged for a family of about 6 next to us enjoying their meal just the same."}
{"text":"It's so exciting whenever I turn the corner of Wellesley and Yonge after getting out of the subway, and I see the green Mexico sign. I know it's close. I know I'll be able to smell the yumminess soon. I know I'll be able to sit and relax and sip on my horchata soon. In two more steps, I'm there. It's Como En Casa. 

Walking in, there is an assortment of tables everywhere. I see the counter at the back, under a huge colorful sign of what deliciousness is available for me to order. It beckons me. So I head on back & place my order. I am given a number and told I can relax and have a seat anywhere. I soon choose a seat facing the street, as it's nice out and the window/door is opened to allow the \"patio\" feel. 

I haven't even settled into my seat yet before my horchata is brought to me. Yummmm! As I enjoy the view of Yonge Street and my horchata, my food is delivered. Hot, steamy, and smells like heaven. Coming from Vancouver, there is nothing quite like home when it comes to tacos (aka La Taqueria). But since I'm here, might as well enjoy these wheat tortillas, grilled to perfection. What makes it amazing is their guacamole -  if you're in the neighborhood, you have got to stop and try it."}
{"text":"This is more of a story than a review

I just started a new job in the neighborhood, was mildly hungover from the night before, and walking around aimlessly in search of the ideal comfort food.

I passed up several burrito places along the way and eventually just gave in to the idea of eating Mexican food.  Saw the sign and walked in.  

I didn't want burritos and I noticed the menu had beef stew.  I've never had Mexican stew before so I just decided to go for it.  The gentleman at the counter asked me why I chose it since, apparently, there was a very favorable review about it recently.  We chatted some more while I waited and he explained that this would be considered \"home food\" in Mexico. 

Someone else came to me from out back, apologizing profusely that the meat wasn't quite right just yet and would need another 15 minutes or so in the pressure cooker for the meat to get more tender.  He offered a substitution in place of the stew, but I wasn't in a rush and now I had my hopes up.  

I finally got my lunch back to the office and was surprised by the portions.  The stew's sauce is thin and absorbed right into the rice.  The meat came in large pieces and extremely tender.  The potatoes were pretty much perfect, the Salsa was tasty and the beans were awesome.  You could taste the peppers used in the stew and it all came together really well.

Only thing I would change is maybe cooking it slower and longer without a pressure cooker to let the flavors soak into the meat... I guess I'll have to try that at home.

I think I've found my new favorite hearty meal in the area.  I'm definitely going back.

Update on 10/08:
Went back again today.  Tried the Adobo Chicken.  It's even better than the beef stew was.  Definitely going to go back more now.  

The chicken is melt in your mouth tender and juicy.  The sauce is tangy, with a hint of sweet and spicy and the portions are great."}
{"text":"Excellent service to go with the large portions of food. My girlfriend and I had the chicken quesidilla and beef buritto respectively and were thoroughly pleased with our food. For desert, we ordered the 3 leches cake (pronounced: treze leches) which has easily become my favorite cake. If you like mexican food you should definately give this place a try."}
{"text":"First time venturing into this restaurant for lunch with a friend and so glad we did!  I usually don't dabble in authentic Mexican cuisine and it's only the third Mexican restaurant I've tried in TO but boy was I impressed!  I opted for the fish tacos meal for $11.50 - 2 fish tacos, salad, rice, guacamole and salsa.  It was delicious!  Tasted exactly like the tacos I've delighted in while in downtown Playa del Carmen, Mexico!  The decor in the restaurant was very eye-catching as well, Spanish beats completed the ambiance.  I will certainly circle back and slowly sample the rest of the menu.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Great burritos and the staff are really friendly.

I always keep meaning to try their mole when ever my wife and I drop by, but always end up with a burrito"}
{"text":"Imagining enchiladas to be baked and cheesy (like the ones I always see pictures of), I was actually pretty disappointed with what I got. Everything was just ok and the verde sauce was a little too spicy for me. I also personally thought this dish had a weird flavour profile. It's not something I would order again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my girlfriend and both times it was awesome! The service was absolutely phenomenal. They were super friendly and genuine both times I was there. 

The food is excellent as well! Huge portions for an inexpensive price! I had their chicken quesadilla and it was delicious, ginormous, and under $9. 

Perfect if you want a quick sit down meal. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I arrived here at 8:40PM, they close at 9. They slammed the door in my face and told me that I WAS rude for trying to order as they were closing. The owner practically spat in my face. I wouldn't spend my money here it was the last place on earth. Friends told me it wasn't good anyways. I DO NOT recommend to anyone. This place should be shut down for the way they treat their customers. Disposable. Get out of the restaurant business - if you say you close at 9, don't lock the door at 8:36, selfish."}
{"text":"I went there today because of all the great reviews of the place on here. I had the fish taco meal that came with salad, rice and a side of guacamole. Sooo good! It was very salty but that enhanced the taste. The fish tacos were great. The meal was $10.99. There was also a World Cup game going on between Australia and Netherlands so that was playing. It was just a very cozy and chill place."}
{"text":"Oye! Arriba arriba!  Andale andale!

La comida era muy sabrosa.

Tasty!  Omnom worthy.  It's not quite Mexico.. or even California or Florida.  But for Toronto, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"ordered the guac which was good, side salad which was very enjoyable, fish burrito and fish taco.
I didnt enjoy flavor of burrito and taco. it is sour due to the pickled radish in it. for a little more $, i'd prefer to go elsewhere for better flavor and quality. 
I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"I met with a couple friends here before heading out and had a quick bite to stay.  I wasn't sure what to order but everything looked to be decent as most of the tortilla wrapped items seemed to be grilled / pressed?  I ended up going with the chicken mole plate instead.

This is order at the counter, pick up a number and the order will be brought to you type of place.  I seem to think this system is becoming more popular these days for fast and easy type of places like Wvurst.  

The chicken mole plate was a decent serving and looked quite appetizing.  The food I hate to say was just satisfactory.  The rice tasted bland and frijoles refritos was about the same.  The chicken while good didn't overwhelm.  I know this dish has chocolate and it makes it rich but I was sort of expecting more flavor and for the dish I had ordered I didn't get that.  I guess I was expecting more I don't have any other way of explaining it.

The food here overall is not that expensive.  Most dishes are just over 10 dollars and the other food such as tacos, burritos, quesadillas etc are under 10 bucks except for the fish tacos.

Toronto doesn't have that many Mexican places but this place is more of a fast food/casual type place.  Bottom line it's not amazing but decent."}
{"text":"Excellent food with excellent service. The staff are very friendly. I would greatly recommend the chicken mole."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from work, hungry and a little curious about this place, and I am so glad I walked in. Over the past year I tried a quite few things on their menu and loved all of it. My favourite would be the beef tacos. The braised beef has so much flavour, and toppings are fresh. I've never seen anyone grill tacos before, but it's something special to the dish. The burritos and quesadillas are great too!

The staff here are always smiling and super nice; I don't think I've ever been disappointed at their service. And the prices are very reasonable, and the portions are nice and generous. They renovated the restaurant recently, which is really nice and I hope they will attract more people. If you like Mexican food, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Okay. So I've been here a couple times now. First, don't order the quesadilla. It's really hard to eat and isn't worth it. Did you know that quesadillas aren't Mexican fare? They are Tex-Mex. Go to Taco Bell for this dish haha. 
Instead spend your money on the beef tacos here. And the other tacos, but the beef is sooooo good. The prices are nice. The house made drinks are good, although the rice-pudding like one isn't to my tastes.

You could literally walk right past this place, but if you do happen to look inside, it's usually got a good number of people eating away. Aside from the yummy food, the service is really friendly too."}
{"text":"Friendly service. The food was impressive, the onion in the burrito is a bit spicy  but the rice was delicious. Would ddefinitely go there again. My only concern was with the portion of the food, its a but little, had to eat 2 burritos."}
{"text":"New favourite Mexican place!

I try to come every weekend for the Pozole. The food is fresh the service is friendly and they are attentive to any dietary needs."}
{"text":"Just got back to Toronto from Maya Riviera where I was pampered with amazing food at a top all inclusive... had a craving and came here.  SOOOO GOOD!   Delicious beef stew on rice with guac, beans, potato and beans.  Hits the spot and no fuss! !  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican food in Toronto, not to mention some of the friendliest staff I've ever seen.  I'm already bringing friends and family there.  Since my first dinner there 2 months ago, I have returned 4 times.  Every meal is even better than the last.  And the horchata is delicious."}
{"text":"Love the authentic feel of this place. Love that everyone who works there speaks Spanish.
And the food is really good as well!"}
{"text":"Picked up a Mas Grande Chicken Burrito with guac 5 minutes before close.  Extremely delicious!  All the ingredients were fresh and it wasn't messy at all.  Managed to eat it on my way from Wellesley to Downsview without spilling or dripping a bite.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"The taco meal here is really good for $7.90! The service is exceptional and both the owners are extremely friendly and always sport a smile on their faces. It's refreshing to experience down to earth hospitality in a fast food joint. Looking forward to trying out the other items on their menu in the near future."}
{"text":"Affordable home style Mexican food. If you're into pulled chicken, beans, salsa, and guac, this place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week and ordered the beef dinner plate for $9.95.  It came with rice, salad, beans, sour cream and salsa.   

I thought everything was okay, but not outstanding.  In addition, I asked for the salsa medium spicy and wasn't even spicy to me.  The beef was tasty, but slightly too tough however there was an ample amount. The sides were alright.  

So would I return to this place? Sure, why not?  Would I make a special trip to Toronto for this place? Most likely not."}
{"text":"I've passed this unassuming place on Yonge for quite some time now, and don't know why I haven't gone in until now.

I went in on a Tuesday night to satisfy my craving for Mexican food, after my friend texted me about her Mexican dinner. Starving, and not willing to trek all the way to the suburbs, I thought I'd try that Mexican joint by Wellesley station. Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly gentleman. They had a Fish Taco dinner special that night, but I passed. I ended up ordering the Casa Dinner Plate with chicken, which the menu describes as \"a little bit of everything\" and thought it'd be a safe choice.

There were only two other diners at the time, so my meal was ready in less than five minutes. A generous portion of rice, beans, and salad accompanied my chicken. Bonus points for the rice having a bit of crispiness and the salad not being overly dressed. The chicken was nice and tender, with the right level of spice. The hot sauce on the side could've had a bit more of a kick, but overall, I was satisfied. And despite being a quick-service joint, the guy at the counter made an effort to check up on me.

I will definitely be back, especially considering this place is right by my apartment. For less than $10, you get good value for your dollar!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Hole in the wall restaurant just by the intersection of Yonge and Wellesley. Service is always friendly and I absolutely love their guacamole (I rate it 5 stars!), which I always swing by to buy as takeout. I also enjoy their casa dinner plate which includes a bit of everything, which satisfies me on days I'm particularly hungry and craving just about everything. Tried their fish tacos once but didn't like them at all - were kinda soggy. 

Overall, I like this joint quite a bit as their prices are decent and it's in a convenient location for me. Definitely check it out if you live in the neighborhood - but I wouldn't say this is one of those places you should go out of your way for if you're not nearby."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 3 for dinner and ordered the Enchiladas, Fish Tacos, Chicken Quesadilla and later the Pork Tacos. We also got a Steam Whistle (part of their Fish Taco and Steam Whistle special for I think $15 on Fridays) and a Pineapple-flavoured Jarritos (a popular Mexican carbonated drink - went quite well with the food). 

Every dish was awesome, with my personal favourites being the Pork Tacos and the Quesadilla. The guacamole here is also AMAZING (sweet and citrusy) as well as the refried beans (very soft in texture, topped with feta cheese). It wasn't too busy when I came here on a Friday night, which is a surprise because the food here is top notch - but also good because you don't have to wait as long :)

They also have a lot of decorations, as well as art displayed on the walls that you can buy. After you order, they bring you a box of just the right number of utensils (which I appreciate, because it's more hygienic than those large self-serve containers.) The people who work here are also very nice and the restaurant has a family-run vibe. 

Looking forward to coming here regularly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went on the recommendation of co-workers. It was a good choice. I got the biggest quesadilla I've ever seen and a drink for about $10. The chicken was tender and deliciously spiced. There was fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and corn. A good amount of cheese. Choice of white or whole wheat. It was served with sour cream and salsa. The salsa had a good hit of cilantro. Any place that gives me cilantro is giving me everything I need. The food came quick despite a few orders ahead of me. The staff were friendly and energetic. I'll definitely be back. Minus one star because the decor is minimal, the floor could have used a mopping, and while they bring the food to your table you have to stand in line to order (and I'm lazy). This one will be added to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos!! The customer service is amazing, the owner seems to really care about your preferences and how your experience was. It's a small but homey restaurant. Would come here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's really a step up from many other Burrito places. The owner is really friendly, although he may forget to bring you the drink ;) Food is very delicious and quick and very nice atmosphere for a quick bite"}
{"text":"If you are downtown/work in the area, this little Mexican joint hits the spot. They are a pretty diverse menu (e.g. enchiladas, burritos, tacos, salads, various mole and stew dishes , etc). The burritos and enchiladas come with a choice of sauce (verde-mild, chipotle, or mole). If you're looking for something spicy they have a special hot sauce as well. The combos come with sides beans (pretty good flavour!) and rice/salad. The flavours are all there and the prices are pretty decent. It's a better value to get the lunchtime taco meal but the meal combos (about $13) are delish. I'll be honest though, if you're looking for a crazy authentic Mexican cuisine, this isn't the place. This place is good, has the right flavours, but definitely don't compare it to your abuela's cooking."}
{"text":"Restaurant needs some TLC.  Nicely priced but honestly the food is very ordinary - 3 stars is a stretch.  Only refried beans; rice is clumped together; chicken tomales had little flavour.  I wouldnt go out of my way to revsisit, too much great Mexican/Central American food that unless you are a resident I would not waste the dollars or taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for authentic Mexican food. For two people, we  ordered 2 empanadas, taco dish and 2 sweet tamales and it was all really good. Everything was fresh and the meat in particular was flavourful and tender. Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have no idea what everyone is raving about! I had the chicken tacos and really didn't like them. They were soft, grilled tortillas - like a quesadilla. Way too much cheese, and no sour cream. My rice had bits of dried rice in it-like it had been sitting too long, and the top of the rice dish got hard and then they stirred it! Feta cheese on my re fried beans.  When I asked my waiter if it was the right order, he told me this is traditional Mexican cuisine. I travelled all over Mexico and never had tacos like that. I will not be back. The only thing that I agree with about the reviews of this place is: that the staff is really friendly.  Otherwise... YECK."}
{"text":"2nd time here, it wasn't the same. Still good but something changed here.  The food wasn't as spectacular and the people seemed a little down versus usual.
I hope this was a fluke and that they continue to make great food.

Two dishes came out to something like $30... I feel like there was a lot of extra charges which was unexpected."}
{"text":"Time to upgrade my rating on this place.

This actually became the Mexican restaurant I frequented the most recently because it was a favourite among coworkers at my last place of employment.

I do actually like the grilling of the tortilla she'll. I've never been to Mexico so maybe it is a style in a particular region there?

Anyways, I'm upgrading by a star because they have a great weekday lunch special, the food is consistent and the service is pretty friendly. I recommend that you give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever tried. Highly recommend this. When I'm in Toronto again I will definitely be going back there"}
{"text":"This place is Legit. I've been there 2 days in a row and both days got the Beef Stew with beans and Guac. The cheese they put on the beans and the sour cream they use taste very authentic. My brother got the beef burrito and calls it the best burrito he has ever tasted and we've had a tonne of burrito's all over Toronto. I'll definitely be frequenting this establishment. The owners told me they were going to be doing breakfast and brunch some time soon! I'm definitely looking forward to that."}
{"text":"I must have passed this place for years and now I regret it. Really solid food made with care.

I had a large chicken burrito with all the bells and whistles and was not dissapointed. The only letdown was a lack of heat after ordering \"hot\" but I can communicate better next time. \"Hey bud, kill it with the heat, eh?\" ;)

Table service was pleasent and the staff was very upbeat.

Good crowd at weekday lunch which is a sign of consistancy.

Give this place a shot! You've probably passed it by like I did."}
{"text":"Went here today with the bae to grab some lunch.

Seriously homey feeling place, smells awesome, and the owner (?) is very friendly. 'Twas quite busy as well, which is always a great sign!

Ordered chicken tamale combo, guac and chips, and a Negra Modelo. The bae got the 3 taco meal deal with a beer too. Food was very quick to arrive to the table and super super tasty! Loved the freshness of the meal and also liked the option to choose your hot-ness level of salsa. Also really liked that nothing was greasy at all - yay!!

I am sad I haven't been here before but am so happy I found this place and look forward to returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had in a while!!
I was expecting mediocre. Nope, definitely better than most places in the city. 
6 tacos for $28 taxes in"}
{"text":"2 tacos, rice, beans, salsa, and drink for $6.99, como en casa \"like at home\", yes pls!! (This is their lunch special from 11am-3pm)

I first visited this place on Tuesday, and well today's Wednesday and I'm back... 

First day I had a chicken taco and a pork taco, rice, beans, medium salsa, guacamole (extra $1), and Perrier (extra $1). 

Both tacos were delicious, the rice and beans were a great addition to make it a full meal. The meats were both braised and the tacos had melted cheese and were grilled. The only thing I wish is that they used corn tortillas instead of flour but I might ask if they could switch next time. Today I got beef and pork and they were also delicious. I love that you can just pick any two and even add another for $2. 

The salsa and guacamole are smaller portions then some other places but they're also free and a $1. I found it to be just right for two tacos.

Como en Casa is a very home style Mexican place, nothing fancy like some of the trendy taco places in the city but delicious and reasonably priced, I'd say it's the perfect grab a quick bite but not \"fast food\" type meal. 

The interior is nice, solid wood tables, cushioned chairs, tacos served on plates with cutlery but it's not sit down table service. You order at the counter, they give you a number and you grab your own drinks, cutlery, and seats. 

I like it because it's a bit more chill and makes for a nice everyday option. As a meal I'd say 4 stars but the price makes it a 5 star in the under $10 price point."}
{"text":"A cute little place with a festive ambience and very friendly staff.  Ordered a variety of tacos and chicken enchiladas. Food was very good and pretty to look at.  Really fresh tasting. Maybe a little plain in the flavour department, but was a fun place to eat none the less.  Prices could be a bit lower for what you get."}
{"text":"Pork stew and taco plate (beef & chicken).   Both very good. 
Fast and friendly service at a reasonable price. 
Good hot slasa Verde."}
{"text":"Best Mexican!! My husband and I discovered this little place on a recent trip from Buffalo, NY. We came up for the day to go to Bar Volo. We had to walk by Como En Casa from the parking lot to Bar Volo. We decided to give it a try and were completely shocked that this little place was so good. We just came back up to Toronto for the day and made this place our first stop. I got the fish tacos again. The fish is very light and almost creamy. I can't get enough. My husband got the chicken mole. He loves mole and this is the best we've had. If you're on the fence about eating here just give it a try you won't regret it. I'm willing to drive from Buffalo, NY just for this place."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now.  Humble, superfriendly, very easy-going place to grab a meal.  I'm not sure how terribly \"authentic\" I'd call it, but it certainly rates decently.  So, for example, don't come here looking for handmade tamales, but they do make enchiladas that are more than decent.  They seem particularly keen  to cater to vegetarian tastes if that's your thing.  *Very* reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Was really craving a burrito but my friends wanted tacos so we settled on this place. Service is pretty quick, although we got shamed for ordering take-out but still sitting down to eat (we just wanted a box + bag bc we weren't gonna finish our meal).

Got a large beef burrito for around $12. Very impressed with the size to portion ratio. The burrito itself was alright; this place's specialty is definitely tacos and platters, so its burrito was just about average. You can't really customize your toppings like you would at specialty burrito places. It was also a bit soggy due to the large portions of beef weighing down the rice. Overall, not bad though"}
{"text":"Their chicken tacos melt in your mouth. The prices are a steal! The rice was a little dry to my liking but everything else was delicious. I wanted to try the empanadas but they were sold out. :(  I will definitely come back for the tacos and order the empanadas.  The food is fresh and their pops are imported from Mexico so the coke tastes a but different (not as carbonated and strong).  The place only has about 6 tables so it's small. I would order take-out if it seems busy."}
{"text":"Anytime you've experienced TACOS EL ASADOR.. tough to experience a better burrito in Toronto.  I had the chicken mas Grande; overcooked rice, bland and a hair...  disastrous.  Never again."}
{"text":"Have been to some great Mexican restaurants everywhere and this definitely lives up to the standard. Great tasting food, service and price. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was okay... I think it lacked flavor and that's the one thing I look forward to the most with Mexican food. I didn't necessarily love it but I didn't hate it either. It was just \"meh\". For reference, we ordered the chicken enchalidas, chicken tacos, and tamale."}
{"text":"Many menu choices, great selection.  Very filling.  Good portions.  Quite tasty.  Friendly service.  Looking forward to trying their Tamal Meal (Tamale)"}
{"text":"Finally got their chicken tamal in third visiting. My friends and I came there for dinner after watching the movie Mission 5. The food actually made my day. It was located on the Yonge street with a flag of Mexico. Easy to find. The restaurant was very busy at meal time. I think the reasons are their delicious food and reasonable price.

The owner and staff were all very friendly. Order your food at cashier table, get your order number and staff would sent food to you later. I have the tamal which is mole stuffed chicken and warped in a large plantain leaf. My friends chose basa fish taco combo and beef stew combo. The beef was tender but a little tasteless but the beans were very good. Fish taco was OK and I like the side salad dish.

Overall, the restaurant was very good and worth trying in Yonge st."}
{"text":"Como En Casa makes some pretty darn good Mexican food.

Outside looks kinda sketchy, so if you're skeptical about it, don't be! Just muster up some courage and walk through those doors, trust me, you won't regret it.

The interior of this establishment is kind of out dated but the food makes up for it! It's really dim lit and tiny but it gave off a very nice homey vibe to it (probably because the owner is such a nice guy).

Onto the food, I ordered their chicken mole and my friend got their fish taco meal. The price wasn't too bad, everything on the menu ranges from $8-10. They gave a decent portion which was good for my stomach and my wallet!

The chicken mole was excellent, it was cooked perfectly. The meat just came apart with ease and the sauce had great flavour. The pinto beans and the rice was a nice addition to the meal because it balances the heavy and salty flavours of the mole chicken. 

The fish tacos tasted pretty awesome too. The coleslaw that was paired up with the deep fried fish was really tasty too and I think that really gave the tacos a nice kick to them.

Overall, you better mex your way here because the food here is fan-taco-stic."}
{"text":"Popped into this little place as it's just up the street from my hotel.  What a great find.
Wasn't overly busy, but based on the size of the place, it wouldn't take many people to completely fill it either.

The drill is, you walk to the back where there is a counter/Kitchen.  The menu board is above the counter and on the wall.  I decided I'd go with the Chicken Mole Meal, paid at the counter and then took a seat at a table.  A couple of minutes later, the plate was delivered to the table and although presentation was a bit lacking, that soon doesn't matter after you take your first couple of bites.  Everything was hot, and delish !  Winner, Winner, Mole Chicken Dinner !!  
On the plate was Chicken Mole (obviously), rice and refried beans.  

Overall, The place is pretty small, so if you are one or two people it'll be fine, but larger groups.  Well good luck.  They had a TV loudly playing some kind of Mexican dance music, so ambiance wasn't overly stellar.  The meal was $11.50.  Good value for money and the taste was great.  I'm definitely making my way back to Como En Casa (\"Like at Home\" - although at my home I didn't ever have this quality of Mexican food)."}
{"text":"Cute little Mexican place! 

The food and service is fast. I really love Fish Tacos. The combo is too much food. I substituted my rice for salad."}
{"text":"It's funny how every time I've wanted to try this restaurant, it's been closed. Finally a day where I walk by and it's open! I had high expectations given the reviews on Yelp.

It was expensive. $13 for just this dinner plate (packed to go) and nothing special about it. The food just tasted plain. I've definitely had better.
The service was very friendly, but overall it was not a good value for the food.

I wouldn't recommend this, but they might have better menu items."}
{"text":"Authentic tasting Mexican food in a central downtown location at great prices! The chicken enchilada meal was absolutely delicious. Three bundles of tortilla-wrapped chicken comes covered in a mole sauce and topped with a small salad, along with a side of rice and beans. The mole sauce was deep and dark, with that rich chocolate taste coming through without being too overpowering. The little cup of salsa placed on the side adds a bright counterbalance and can be customized to your preferred spice level. I think the default is medium which was quite spicy for me, I should have gone with mild instead. 

The space is small but cozy, with around a dozen 2-ppl tables for guests. The bright yellow walls and red accents bring a festive air to the space. You order at the counter, grab a number and they will bring everything else to you. Great friendly service also!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Best Mexican I've had in the GTA and quite cheap. Very friendly and welcoming service; as the sign says \"Mi Casa es su Casa\". The two fish taco meal is very popular and comes on a large plate with generous portions of rice, salsa, salad and guacamole."}
{"text":"I came here for the tamales...but unfortunately they didn't have tamales when I went...they were in the process of making them, but apparently they take several days to make, so they told me to come back in a couple of days. So that's my plan - to return for the tamales. But anyway...

Since there were no tamales to be had, I settled for corn tacos with pork. They were good, but unremarkable. The beans were very good and the rice was decent, if a bit dry. I also ordered horchata, which was much sweeter than I'm used to and had an aftertaste - not a bad aftertaste, just different than what I'm used to. 

All in all, I had a good, if unremarkable, meal and will definitely be returning for the tamales!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food at very reasonable prices. I had the Pork Stew. The chunks were larger than expected, more than 1\" square. Spicy but not too much so. Partner had the Beef Stew which was also very nice."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim during my lunch hour. 

You know, it's a bit refreshing to find an \"old-fashioned\" Mexican place these days. With no tattoo/graffiti on the walls or $5 tacos in sight, Como En Casa looks like the kind of place my made-up Mexican grandmother would enjoy.

$6.99 yields two tacos on a soft tortilla shell, with your choice of chicken, pork, or beef. The meat was braised/stewed, and delectable. I found the chicken to be more tender than the beef. Lettuce, sour cream, and your choice of salsa tops it off. Rice (that's actually tasty), and beans (re-fried) complete the meal. During weekdays, you get a free pop or bottle of water. I'm still stuffed, and will be back to sample some of the other options.

Better, the service here was warm, welcoming, and friendly. Debit and credit accepted - the machine is hidden a bit on first sight.

{"text":"I just moved to Toronto and his place is my favorite place, I have been a few times,  getting different things each time, I cannot fault them and will keep coming back. Great space, great food and great service."}
{"text":"I just had a chicken burrito and it was out of this world.

I've always be reluctant to try Como En Casa though I walk by it often, thinking it would be just an unauthentic fair with dry chicken and tasteless rice. 

But no, it offers the EXACT OPPOSITE. The burrito was moist and each component that went in was very well seasoned. They also put it on the grill and flattens it out, the end result is a burrito that just warms up your stomach. Payed 10 for mine with extra guac."}
{"text":"Service - very friendly; order & pay at front, grab a number and they bring to you. 

Venue - Not a huge amount of seating. We arrived on Saturday around 12:30 so it was empty, but by 1:30 it was full. 

Food - Got the Veg tamale. It's very large, but unfortunately it was very dry, and for some reason the veg tamale just seemed to have beans in it (beans are not a vegetable...). Tried to moisten it with the salsa, but the complimentary salsa is the amount you get in those McDonalds ketchup cups. 

However my friend did say the fish taco was one of the best she had in the city, but mentioned the beef was kind of bland. 

Value - great, prices are generally cheaper than most Mexican places in the city."}
{"text":"recommend the burritos and the veggie dinner platter! the bean paste is among the best I've had"}
{"text":"Excellent little Mexican restaurant right on Yonge St. The food was delicious and very authentic. The staff are very nice and give excellent service. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I go to school right up the street and I always find myself here at lunch to pick up a burrito. The portions are good  the meat is very well seasoned and has a zesty flavour. It takes just as long as any other burrito place but I can't complain because it is definitely worth the wait! Everything is seasoned perfectly and has the right consistency the hot sauce is actually spicy which is great! The rice is so tasteful and this is honestly the best burrito in the city! A must try for anyone who is a fan of Mexican food that tastes home-made!"}
{"text":"Prices, options, and service are great for lunchtime patrons, but keep in mind you're limited to beer if you want to go here for drinks. My friend and I both ordered the fish taco lunch combo and we arrived early to snag seats before the Friday lunch rush. It does get pretty loud in here. They offer quite a few gluten free options even though the menu is pretty simple. I would definitely come back here again!

IMHO authenticity is irrelevant as long as food tastes good and looks appealing. It baffles me that some people seem to uphold an undeviating expectation based on a memory of a lunch from five years ago: why not live in the now? Also, it seems unlikely that all Mexican food is made the same way throughout every region in Mexico. If something is lacking, why not suggest specific details for making it better (i.e. more of one spice, less meat/beans)? Authenticity is relative, nebulous, and difficult to prove."}
{"text":"4.5*s  

If you're into Mexican, don't walk by this place without checking it out!!!  Definitely an easy place to miss with all the stuff that's going on this strip, but I believe this is the only Mexican place in the immediate area - sorry, Hernando's doesn't count!

I wasn't super hungry, in fact still full from lunch, so I split a Fish Taco Meal - 2 fish tacos, rice, & salad.  I don't remember if I had the choice, but I would've had their beans over salad any day.

The batter on the fish could've been drier, but it was still good.  Tortillas had a wonderful real corn flavour!  I was sorta full after dinner that I forgot to ask if they had any Tres Leche on-hand.  Really regret that now.  :(

One thing I would change is their atmosphere.  I don't know what it is, but I find it a bit dark and very Subway-like.  Also when the windows are opened, you get the loud Yonge traffic as the background noise."}
{"text":"The most absolutely most delicious burritos in the city of Toronto. I challenge someone to find me a better but I wish them lots of luck. Authentic flavour and menu items and deserts sets Coma Casa out from the others."}
{"text":"Maybe I was there on a bad day, but the fish tacos were terrible. I have had better frozen fish by Captain Highliner. The fish tacos were supposed to be the special of the day. I was really disappointed.

Maybe I went there on a bad day. However, I have read some positive reviews below, so maybe I will give them another try when I am in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"great find in the neighbourhood. Everything is flavorful and prepared with care. Their Mexican Chicken soup is the best! Staff are super nice, good place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"We ordered Pork stew and Taco Meal. Great food, simple favours. The staff is very polite."}
{"text":"I feel bad about what I am about to write because the workers there were friendly.  But here we go:

The Good: 

- Chicken tacos are the best tasting among the tacos. 
- My friend was high on weed and loved the food (but then he drank a glass of water and said that was amazing).
- My other sober friend liked the Chicken Adobo.

The Bad: 

- Beef quesadilla is bland.  After the meal it felt like I just ate a pot of beef boiled in water with no seasoning.  
- Tacos do not have hard shell and are made from the exact same soft shell flour as quesadilla, so get one or another or you will be ordering two of the same. 
- Chicken taco better than pork taco better than beef taco.

We will go back again to try the Chicken Adobo and if that's good we will go back just for that."}
{"text":"With the growing popularity of american tex-mex chains, finding quality southwestern food is becoming a bit harder. After dropping by Como En Casa , I was very surprised to be greeted with friendly wait staff, and a well designed space which maximizes seating for a smaller venue. It's really close to food they serve in Nogales or Juarez with more south-western flavor profiles. Compared to the local fare, the prices are very reasonable ranging from $6-$10 per person. Getting a lunch special or platter is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"Pleasant service. Traditional Mexican food. Not commercialized. Very good. Lots of flavor. I had the pork stew in verde sauce - mild. But hot enough for me! Lots of food. Good value for $11.50."}
{"text":"Ate there today for lunch, had the Adobo chicken, was very tasty.  All the employees were Spanish-speaking, which contributed to the authentic feel of the place.  Will definitely go back to try the burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"I stay a block away from Como en  Casa and pick up food all the one time! The food in flavourful and hearty and the portions generous! 

I love love love the Adobo chicken and once had the owner explain to me that Adobo sauce is originally Filipino and that the Spanish brought it to Mexico. Of course the Mexicans gave it their own twist, he said.

Yes... they are an enthusiastic bunch, the staff, and that passion shows in the food. The empanadas simply rock -- especially the beef and cheese and my husband could eat their pork burrito every single day. And the tamales are a yummy and healthy alternative for healthy eaters like me!

The food's not fussy and the delivery fast! And a little birdy told me they are going to serve liquor soon! Can't wait:)"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant in June 2014 and after reviewing their menu, I asked them what I could order without onions. Their response was \"nothing.\" Simple as that. Wow. I love food, I eat out often, I have lived in Mexico, eaten Mexican food in Toronto and other cities and countries, and I have never encountered an establishment that could not accommodate the \"no onion\" request. Other establishments either had menu options with no onions or they made the food from scratch and could omit the onions. But I guess there is always a first. And this restaurant is the first Mexican restaurant to have both poor customer service and inability to accommodate a simple request that most places have no problem with.

***I returned to this establishment on June 1st, 2014 because I wanted my friends to give this restaurant a try. This time I was greeted kindly by who I believe is the owner. He was very friendly and approachable. Since I was already there, I decided to try their chicken tamal combo with a side of rice and beans. Maybe they make tamales differently in Mexico, but the tamales I have had in the past (and I have eaten MANY in my life as it is a staple in a lot of Hispanic countries--I am Hispanic), I have never eaten one where the dough was filled with an array of ingredients. Generally \"la masa\" (the dough) is made with ingredients that are either blended or with stock, so that the dough stays silky smooth. After you have the dough completed, you make a pocket in it (this can be done several ways) and you fill this pocket with pork (most common protein) or chicken and a few other ingredients (depending on the country) such as a slice of green pepper, a piece of potato, rice, a tomato slice, etc. The point being that the dough is silky, and in the middle you have the filling. This tamal was nothing like that. Also, tamales are often frozen after they are cooked, and to heat them up you boil them. This should not affect the flavor because they are tightly wrapped in a banana leaf. When you serve them, you cut open the leaf and it should taste freshly cooked. This tamal on the other hand appeared to have been heated in the microwave. If you look at the pictures of the tamales that have been posted by other Yelpers, you will notice that the dough is not smooth, and it is dry in some areas (often a result from something being re-heated in a microwave).

The lovely service and the ambiance get kudos from me. But the food.. I am sorry, but it did not taste authentic to me at all.

Oh, and I did not know that in Mexico they put carrots and peas in their rice?! Things must have really changed since I last lived there."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican fare and amazing, friendly service (get the fish tacos and enchiladas verdes)!!"}
{"text":"Was here for the 2nd time last week. I went to TKRE for lunch and I was still hungry (please see my review for TKRE) so I ended up here. I had the sorrel drink which was very refreshing. Also this was my first time trying fish tacos! I had 2 and they were delicious. I like the fact that they are authentic. I will be back..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today and was extremely impressed  with the food! Very welcoming and friendly service :) I ordered the veggie quesadillas (sweet potato/cactus) which came with guac, so delicious!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New fav spot! Friendly owners and fresh, tasty Mexican food!
Can't wait to try their fish tacos"}
{"text":"The food was great! Delicious authentic Mexican food (except the hot salsa isn't appropriately hot enough for an authentic Mexican restaurant).

We got the beef burrito and creamy chipotle chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas came with some salsa on the side as well as rice and beans. There were also picketed jalapeños, carrots, and onions at a self served bar which goes great with the food. 

You can watch them assemble the food because there is a glass window. Service is super fast and friendly and we liked the food."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight for the first time. It was amazing!! There were 6 of us celebrating our friend, who is 93 years old. She is a regular customer. Fernando and his staff treated us like gold. They normally don't offer full table service, meaning delivering drinks, etc., yet they did for us. The food was absolutely delicious! Best guacamole I've ever had - hands down!! I had the pork tacos on corn tortillas - make sure specify you want corn- and they were just incredible! Then Fernando brought us this incredible dessert from a recipe his sister just taught him to make from Mexico. It was this delightful cinnamon waffle looking type thing - still haven't got the name straight. It was light and airy - melt in your mouth!! OMG, it was out of this world!! He promised to add it to the menu! 
Thank you Fernando and your team for a great evening. You were all amazing and I can't wait to enjoy another great meal and the pleasure of your company!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great value! Service is friendly and hot sauce to die for literately. A real find"}
{"text":"The past decade has seen an explosion of Mexican fast-casual restaurants in the city. Most trade in authenticity for marketing, portion size, and high-calorie deliciousness. 

A few try to offer something more than screaming hot sauces, blankets of cheese, and thick rivers of orange grease slicking the interior of your burrito wrapper. 

Como En Casa is such an enterprise. As far as I know, it's a one-off, located on Yonge just above Wellesley. It is awkwardly laid-out, like most holes-in-the wall on the strip, with a few tables in front and down the side, a cash register facing you when you walk in/order, and an open kitchen assembling your plate, which dominates the back two thirds of the space. The walls are lined with art for sale; some of which depicts Mexican wrestlers. Bonus!  I imagine there's a bathroom on the premises, but I lack the courage to check it out. 

To order, you read a menu on the wall, then walk up to the host manning the cash register. He is unfailingly gracious, polite and patient, answering questions and guiding novices to dishes he thinks they'll like. 

Of course, you'll find your grilled chicken wrapped in tortillas of various shapes and sizes, but the fun comes when you go for something a bit bolder. While most Mexican places equate salt and heat with flavour. C+C dials both down in favour of complex sauciness. Pork stew in verde sauce is tangy and bitey; with large chunks of pork. The base is great; the pork itself is inconsistent. Some bites are meltingly tender, while others are dry and chewy. Chicken mole is a solid bet if you're a mole kinda guy; pulled bits of tender bird smothered in near-jet-black sauce. I find most moles taste indistinctly burnt. Como en Casa's is somehow just a bit lighter, letting me taste the complexity of the sauce. 

Burritos are less successful; blander fixings that magically transform into a plated dish when the tortilla gives way halfway through. 

Plated meals (well, meals that you order plated) arrive with rice (dusty brown and speckled with past-their-prime frozen veg) and beans strewn with a little bit of sharp cheese. It's all a bit monochromatic, but I sure don't leave hungry. 

And oh yeah; the legendary Mexican coke! 

Como en Casa is unlikely to make a dent in larger, less authentic chains' business, but that's fine. A little bit more authentic, a lot more flavourful, a great choice for  lunch."}
{"text":"My rating for this place would be somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. 

I really dig friendly customer service, and based on all the reviews I thought I'd be getting that but it wasn't as friendly there as other reviewers mentioned. 

The food was just OK, I had the beef taco meal. Very scant serving of meat which was dry, I'd trade more meat (if it wasn't so dry) for less rice and beans. As for the guac, I could make the same at home so I don't know why everyone is raving over this.

I'll try this place again, maybe I just ordered wrong."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Not full service. It's worth a try. We tried:

Chicken mole: it was a bit too chocolatey for me, but it was the first time I had chicken mole. It was good but probably not for me. 

Enchiladas: pretty tasty large portions. Would recommend this dish.

I enjoy the mexican sodas they have. Their chips arent too great, just decent."}
{"text":"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me \"if guacamole was okay\". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly place! My husband and I are regulars here and it didn't take long to get to know the owners Fernando and Carlos who are super nice. I've tried nearly everything on the menu and it is all delish. I remember the owners once saying that their one dessert that day was a recipe their mom used to make which makes it feel even more authentic. As a side, if you ask them about the artwork being featured on their walls, they'll always have an enthusiastically detailed response!"}
{"text":"Like the name of the store, this place is so homey. I loved their weekend special beef stew and agua jamaica combo (just over $15 CAD). My husband was also happy with his Mas Grande (extra large) Burrito. The store was playing World Cup, which was a plus. Will be back."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Eat here! Their guac (along with everything else) is superb!

The owners of this place takes the award for being super friendly and cheerful. Camera-shy people beware though, they like to photograph their patrons (with your permission of course) so they can put in on their TV slide show!

Their menu is fairly straightforward with tacos, quesadillas, empanadas and burritos and even adobo chicken (which I didn't get to try because it was sold out!), but their combination of fresh ingredients and spices make this place top-notch. In particular, whatever they put in the guac, it's amazing - some of the best guac I've ever had! The portions are substantial and you will be full. This has definitely become one of my go-to spots for a quick and casual meal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend today. We ordered the fish taco meal and the chips and salsa. 

The staff was very friendly. We managed to get a spot before the place quickly filled up. 

The chips were nice and crunchy but a bit oversalted. They're quite frugal with the salsa but I guess that's what the salt on the chips were for... 

The basa fish was quite bland and soggy. Even after adding the guacamole and salsa that comes with the meal, I found the tacos boring. The salad with the meal was very salty and barely edible. 

Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Maybe they slipped up on the seasoning today but even taking that into account I've had much better tacos downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious food, chill atmosphere. Food was made quickly and wait staff were extremely kind. I had the fish tacos which were some of the best I have ever tried. Well worth it, especially considering the price point."}
{"text":"I order delivery from there sometimes. The fish tacos are very good, with the guacamole and salsa it is pretty spicy. The chicken soup is really good, very fresh. Big chunks of chicken and vegetables. Definitely becoming a favourite."}
{"text":"Came here for early dinner ( Around 5:30) and there were barely any people. It's a small hole in the wall kinda place, where you can see the food being prepped. 

I ordered chips and guacamole, casa dinner plate ( veg) and hubby ordered chicken mole dish. Food was average, nothing special. Salsa provided with the meal was in a small paper cup ( about a table spoon). Price was fair enough, cleanliness was alright, staff were okay. 

Wouldn't really recommend to others but may return of cannot get to other good Mexican restaurants in the area or no other options."}
{"text":"REAL Mexican - and the only thing more enjoyable then the food is the ambiance.  The owner hosts this place and treats you like family.  The beef tacos are outstanding - great flavour to the beef.  I'm guessing those who gave negative reviews here likely have never eaten Mexican food in Mexico and their standards are based on Taco Bell.  (PS folks, TACO Bell is NOT Mexican!)
One of the best deals in TO!"}
{"text":"Great little joint for a taco! They serve great Mexican food at a very low price. Forget about grand electric and try this place if u don't want to eat in noisy, and wait so long for a table."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican, this is the place.  Great for burritos or a quick Mexican meal while on the go.  I love the Pork Burrito with guacamole and both hot salsa and mild.

The staff is super friendly and very helpful.  Enjoy a Corona for the full Mexican adventure. 

Definitely good value for money."}
{"text":"Authentic and at it's beat, this Mexican joint hits the spot if you're not super hungry, but can eat. The beef quesadilla with a Jarritos is $14 with tip. The beef is succulent and it's 10 inches, super-packed. The three beef tacos are also jammed with flavour; very filling and doesn't make you hate yourself. $11 with a can of Coke. Sinuses are clear plus you're warm and full. We'll definetely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I passed by the restaurant around 7:30 pm on a friday night and it was packed. Went back in half an hour and was be able to find a table. we got chicken mole and pork stew and each dish was  $13 after tax.  They had pictures of all the dishes on the wall, which helped you to decide.  However, when the food came, they looked smaller portion than the pictures.  I still enjoyed them very much. Both dishes came with bean paste and rice. The reason I took off one star is I wish they could give more rice, as I think they serve good portion of meat and which needs more rice to go with them."}
{"text":"Como en Casa is a nice little family restaurant. The owner was very friendly and came by our table once or twice to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Their fish taco platter was extremely filling. I could probably have been perfectly full with just two fish tacos rather than the entire platter but the salad and rice were definitely nice additions to my meal. My friend got the pork quesadilla and i didnt have a taste but she devoured it and it was overflowing with meat so it looked delicious! Overall, our experience here was great but the only reason i take off one star is the hygiene of the restaurant. Its not dirty but not super clean either. Its what you would expect from a family restaurant though! Great prices as well. I definitely recommend this place as long as you're not a clean freak"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for authentic Mexican cuisine. Friendly service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Ambiance: simple with several colorful mexican paintings/drawings

Staff: very friendly and accommodating 

Food: best Mole I've ever had!! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I find it difficult to find good and authentic food in this area that is surrounded my franchises until I discovered this place! Their pulled beef quesadilla is a must try as well as their guac and chips. The staff are super friendly and it's a cute place to sit and eat in. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down... Such a shame. I was so excited when I first reviewed this joint. 

The fish tacos now are cooked and sit in a metal pan with 20 others getting super soggy. I have had this problem 3 times in a row. They have upped their prices and quality control has gone down. 

Also the last couple times I have gone I have had super wilty salads. Either they accidentally froze it in the back and thawed out the greens again or are just giving me very wilty, old, squishy, brown leafy greens. 

I won't be having their fish tacos again. There are so many other delicious **FRESH** options in the city."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try this place for a long time now, especially since the reviews were so good, ESPECIALLY re: the fish tacos, which is a minor obsession of mine.

This restaurant is run by the nicest people and staff, which is why I'm sad to say that I didn't love my food. The fish was pre-fried! It was soggy and not crispy at all. It made me very sad and did not satisfy the big void in my heart that was craving crispy, fresh fish tacos. I'm a firm believer that any fried foods should be made to order.

I will say the prices are quite fair, even though the portions were not as big as I expected from reading the reviews here. But take that with a grain of salt, because I do have a healthy appetite and I can out-eat most men! *flexes stomach* After polishing off my fish taco meal - the salsa, the guac, the rice, both tacos, as well as my Jumex mango drink - I was just comfortably full.

They use very good tortillas here - they were fresh and they also double-tortilla their tacos (not sure why places do that but I don't mind at all!). The salsa and salad in my order were fresh and tasty. I could definitely have used more guac, though, and the rice was alright.

I ordered a Jumex mango drink because I love all things mango and it was very, very sweet. My delight in seeing that a can was only 150 calories quickly faded when I saw how much sugar was in it - it was like 50g or something crazy.

So all in all...super nice people here, but I really need freshly fried fish in my fried fish tacos!"}
