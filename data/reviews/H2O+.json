{"text":"Came here for dinner while staying at an airport hotel. We were the only people in the restaurant. Decor is clean and tidy. Sushi rolls were nicely presented, tasty, and reasonably priced. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"If you just land in Montreal or live in Dorval or West Island and is craving for some good quality sushi, you definitely have to bookmark this one here. It is a small family run restaurant with friendly and attentive service.  Fish are fresh and appetizers are scrumptious. If you are like and like Hunan dumplings, you must try it there."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here with my wife at 6pm on a Friday night. The restaurant was completely empty (not 1 person inside). They told us they were too busy to serve us, and said that they didn't want us to wait. They recommended that we go to another restaurant because they were too \"busy.\" I told them that was a terrible business strategy, and then the sushi chef told me to \"f**k off\" 3 times. I was taken aback by this encounter, and I was mad enough to leave my first ever review in hopes that it will prevent another person from ever going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the worst sushi I have ever had. The presentation was uninspired, the taste unmotivating and I don't even want to think about the  quality. This always happens when I let my best friend chose the restaurant haha."}
{"text":"My first time and ai am happy to have tried it, I am enjoying my evening after a travel."}
