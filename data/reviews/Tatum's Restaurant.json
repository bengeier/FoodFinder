{"text":"They have tator tots!!! 

We have eaten a few times here and have never been disappointed. The Friday Fish Fry is incredible - tastes just like you are in Wisconsin. The apps are tasty too: Quesadilla, tato skins, and the lettuce wraps are the best! They have a fairly new menu that has quite a few healthier items. My hubby's favorite is the black bean burger. The portions are large but is there really such a thing as too many tator tots? The servers are so friendly as are the bartenders. You can eat outside or at the inside bar too. Great stuff."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner here, and the food was terrible.  The only nice features are the friendly dinner staff and the nice golf course view during the day.  Since those two features can be easily obtained elsewhere, I would not recommend this place.

Breakfast- the eggs and sausages were fine, but the oatmeal was overcooked, and service was completely lacking despite the fact that the restaurant was not even half full.  

Steak salad- ordered the steak medium rare.  It came overly smoked, completely overcooked, and tasted like beef jerky.  The spinach was also not fresh.

Vegetable soup- tasted fine, but nothing special. 

Chicken Caesar- the dressing was fine, but the lettuce was somewhat blackened.  The chicken was also blackened and overcooked.  

Tater Tots- tasted fine, although a bit dry.  

Overall, this is at best a two star restaurant."}
{"text":"After a long wait (-1 star) our food was not cold, but not hot (-1 star), but good tasting and expected portion sizes. Server gave me a good recommendation. I called ahead to confirm they were open for a 2pm lunch yet the dining room with the golf course view was closed and they were only serving in the cafe (-1 star).  Our server disappeared (he later said he went on a break) and the check never came and I had to go to the bar to investigate.

Sometimes restaurants in hotels aren't the best. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Fish Fry on Friday night is awesome here.  We used to drive to Rock Springs in Black Canyon City until the traffic and gas prices got so high.  We have be searching for something closer and Tatums is a great find.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend last night and picked Tatum's because it was walking distance from her condo and we wanted a golf course view.  Sat on the patio and it was nice.  Ordered the french onion soup - bland, and the stuffed mushrooms which were good.   For our meal we ordered the prime rib sandwhich and the philly sandwich - one with tater tots and the other with cajun fries.  We send both our dishes back TWICE because the sandwiches were cold.  It was obvious that they just tried to microwave them because the meat came back very tough and leathery:-(  The waitress had the executive chef take care of it, in which when they came back the plates were hot as well as the food.  Both meals were just ok..I have had better sandwiches at Portillo's.  Fries and tots were nothing special - pretty sure the tots are frozen ones that they just microwave - hence the amount of ketchup needed to eat them.  Waitress was very nice through all of this.  My friend works at a restaurant and I grew up in the grocery and restaurant business - were we too critical?  No, Tatum's needs to work on their menu and their cooking.  Glad we did not order the pricey entrees."}
{"text":"Had dinner and snacks here last night. It is in the hotel where we were staying, Embassy suites Paradise Village. Had the barbecued ribs and they were very tasty. It is a small appetizer with only three large pieces, but they were very yummy and it included coleslaw and onion rings, which were perfect! The price was reasonable at $10. Since it was between 530 and 730, the cocktails were of course free! My friend had the cheeseburger, which she said was delicious and my husband had the cubana carnitas sandwich and appeared to like it, since he ate the whole thing!
We also had breakfast here every morning and you can have an omelette anyway you like it and pancakes. The food is always hot and excellent. The servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast includes scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, fruit, yogurt, toast, cereal, coffee, juice, tea and is included in the price of the hotel.
Saw a review from somebody who was unhappy with this restaurant. Not sure what was wrong with that person, but it is probably somebody who won't be pleased with anything anywhere."}
{"text":"Picked this based on the two reviews. Its been 45 minutes since we saw our server. No appetizers yet. There are two servers and six tables. We have watched two orders go back to the chef, worried about our food. Food came, recommend burgers or sandwiches."}
{"text":"I stepped into breakfast omelette counter but there's no whole eggs left. How hard is that to drive 2 min to buy from sprouts? 
I set down my Lipton hot tea and a cup holding my cooked spinach and chopped mushrooms on top of precooked chopped onion. When I returned from fruit section, I couldn't locate my two cups, so I dug into trash cans to locate cooked spinach without hot tea.
Of course, it's no big deal, I enjoyed conversations with Love..from Lo....na even I taught them what Dept of Health taught me while I bought lunch for him.  Splinkle"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool, staff was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Rueben and that was a mistake.  Although it was tasty, it was almost all fat and grizzle. I really struggled to finish it, but was so hungry after a long day of travel that I just pretended to be a lion on the serengeti and took it down.  Would not eat there again."}
{"text":"We were staying at Embassy Suites, anyway, so after a drink at their guest reception we decided to try their restaurant.  We were very happily surprised. Our server, Diane, was friendly and enthusiastic. We got the Margarita grilled sandwich, which was great. The chicken was smothered in a spicy cheese sauce that was also kind of sweet. Diane substituted a nice jicama slaw instead of fries. Our Zona Cobb salad was covered with Margarita chicken and avocado. It was both attractive and delicious."}
