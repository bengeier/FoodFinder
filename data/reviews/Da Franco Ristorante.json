{"text":"I've been to Da Franco twice, once in the summer and once in the winter, both times I went with big groups for birthday parties.

Service: During my winter visit on 02/15/2014, our waiter was extremely biased towards us depending on whether we were French or not. Our waiter was incredibly cold towards us, he did however treat the one French speaker who was with us obviously nicer. He spoke to us very aggressively. He even messed up one of our orders but rather than apologizing, he rolled his eyes and said, \"no you ordered that\", when my friend clearly ordered another dish. I can say that if it wasn't for the waiter, I would have enjoyed my dinner. 
1/5

Food: Im not even a picky eater and my lasagne tasted like it came out of a can, disappointing for an Italian restaurant. My friend who ordered a steak was also great disappointed. It was a thin soggy slice of beef lathered on tomato sauce, hardly what you would call a steak. Most of my friends liked their pasta dishes however. The prices are reasonable for what you order.
2/5

Atmosphere: Live band in the evening when I went on Saturday, very nice singers, beautiful voices. Restaurant was a little loud, but it gave the room energy.

{"text":"Amazing experience! The food is very fresh and flavorful. They don't rip you off with the ingredients either. The plates were very abundant and plentiful. 
The place is a little hard to find at night but totally worth the money and experience. 
The owner was very friendly and genuine too! He's a very hard working man!"}
{"text":"The place is amazing!!!

Defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant 3 times in the last year and a half.  I have had the lasagna, pizza, and chicken marsala.  All are very good.  Many times the place is completely empty when I visited, but the food has been consistently good.  There is usually only one waiter, but he has been very friendly and helpful each time I have visited.  We ordered the Chianti house wine and it was very good.  They usually have some TVs on if there is a hockey game playing you can watch while you eat.  I have visited during midweek, so maybe it is more crowded at other times.  I would give it a try if you are in the are and looking for some straight forward Italian eating that is very affordable for Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Walked out of our hotel and around the corner. Saw this place and we were all starving. Italian sounded pretty good. We went in and the place was pretty empty. We were there pretty early, but I figured they may be a few people inside. No big deal. Ordered a beer, and took a look at the menu. Many of the classic Italian dishes you see in other nice places. We ordered some tomatoes and mozzarella. I guess it was a salad Caprese, it was very very good. For dinner I had a spaghetti carbonara that was delicious. My daughter has a cheese pizza. Kids are boring eaters, but she loved it. Loved, loved, loved it. I had a slice too. Hand made dough, the thing was delicious as well. We will come back here some day when we visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Cheerfulness and kindness make any waiter glow! The food was delicious and huge beautiful portions lol yes I'm a foodie haha. The coffee was delicious too. The restaurant feels cozy and warm. Overall happy with the place."}
{"text":"Located this restaurant within easy walking distance of our hotel, the Embassy Suites.  I had an excellent Veal Parmagiana with a side of spaghetti with Bolognese sauce, and my wife had an equally excellent canneloni with meat sauce.  The sauces in particular were flavorful, and the meat and pastas also well prepared.  The service was attentive.

I'm docking this restaurant one star for atmosphere on a Saturday night...specifically, there was a singer (who was very good, by the way) whose mic was way too loud, making it virtually impossible to have a quiet conversation due to EVERYONE in the restaurant raising their voices to talk over the singer's mic.  A shame that this situation was so noticeable that it requires this specific criticism, affecting an otherwise lovely meal.

I would certainly recommend this place on a night without the entertainment."}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation from my hotel's concierge.  Walking into this restaurant is was kind of dark. The restaurant seemed to have staple Italian dishes on the menu. I went with the escargot as my appetizer and a pappardelle with sausage special as my entr√©e.  I was with 2 friends so we asked the waiter for suggestions on wine that would go with our various meals. We settled on a Chianti blend that was fantastic. 

The escargot left a lot to be desired. I was expecting them to be in pesto butter as they are served in France. Not so much. They were served with some type white wine sauce with green onion. The green onion was pretty over powering. 

I loved the pappardelle dish. It was a hearty and filling portion without being too big to leave me too stuffed. It was creamy without being too heavy. I loved it."}
{"text":"Great food and the price was reasonable.I had the DaFranco Special pizza, my son had the fettuccine Alfredo and my wife had the ceasar salad. Ample bread was provided and we all enjoyed our entrees. Good service too."}
{"text":"We found this food paradise so close to Notre dame.....we order the escargot for appetizers and garlic shrimp and sole filet in lemon butter. The shrimp and the escargot dish was to die for. The best we have ever tasted. 
We ended with Creme caramel and dulce de leche cheese cake. It was so hard to not order a second round. My wife had to stop me from reordering this yummy cheese cake. We had a great time. The service was so friendly we felt at home . They even helped our 2 year old in keeping her busy while we enjoyed this awesome meal. Cheers"}
{"text":"Had the salmon and loved it.  Fettuccine was awesome! The service was exceptional. Very friendly. The cost was very reasonable and the portions were perfect."}
{"text":"First night in Montreal and Da Franco was near the hotel.  We weren't sure if they were serving because we looked in and there wasn't anyone inside.  But we walked in and someone came out from back and said sit anywhere you like.  We sat in the window.  Like many European cafes and restaurants, people eat late.  We only had a vegetarian meal on the train, so we were hungry.

I had the pear salad to start and Jonesy had the soup of the day.  The description said it was a sausage soup, but turned out to be a poulet avec perle risotto soupe,\" which sounds better than chicken and rice.  I ordered the braised lamb shank which was very tender and came with crispy potatoes and vegetables.  Jonesy had the rib eye which was very tender as well.  The meals came with dessert and the server brought out the hunks of chocolate cake with a moca whipped cream filling.  Very good!  They also have a very nice wine list.

The service was friendly and attentive.  A couple leaving wished us a \"bon appetit\" as they were leaving.  The people around Montreal are very nice.  Before we left, people started to slowly come in.  This is a great place to come to.  It has a very welcoming ambiance and family oriented atmosphere."}
