{"text":"frenchi's is the absolute best place for late night food in south oakland! SO many options for sandwiches, the do frenchi wrap is delish. my personal favorite is the loaded fries 10/10. also frenchi is the MAN :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious (the wraps especially)! The owner and employees are very friendly. One of the best places to eat around Pitt's campus by far. I can't say enough positive things about this place!"}
{"text":"Newer to South Oakland, Frenchi's is a gem. Not only a functional convenience store, Frenchi's offers an assortment of cheap, tasty deli sandwiches, salads, paninis, and wraps. Definitely not a place to attend if you're on a diet, as sandwiches are stacked high with heavy meats, cheeses and dressings. Pick a bag of chips, and Frenchi will add those to your sandwich as well.  Part of the Frenchi's experience is interacting with Frenchi himself. The deli's owner is almost always on site, chipperly chatting with customers and asking for tips on how he can make his business more appealing and accessible to college students. It's refreshing to see a business owner so engaged in fostering a community around his food.  While a Frenchi's sandwich won't make you skinny, they're a delicious choice for a game day, or drunk snacking. The signature \"Le Frenchi\" is one of my top Oakland picks to munch on a night out."}
{"text":"Not only is the DoFrenchi amazing, but talking with Frenchi himself is part of the experience. He is the man. Definitely try to pick up a sandwich if you're near Oakland!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like wraps or subs this is the spot! I never knew about this place until I saw it on Yelp..decided to try and was very pleased..Good food and good service!"}
{"text":"Well, there goes my beach body...  I happened to be picking food up for UberEATS and I usually don't have a desire to get food from places that I pick up from. But after explaining how I never even heard of this place, countless people were shocked to hear that and insisted that I come back and get the #1. So, I made the worse/best mistake and came back that same night after I was done and got the #1. The owner was super nice and the food was made super quick. I ate it too fast to take a picture but I will certainly take one the next time I go (because I will surely go back). It was so good!"}
{"text":"Order the do(rito)-frenchie you don't need to thank me.  Just what Oakland, better yet our world needs. A man that cares about his customers just as much as he cares about his family and food. You won't see better customer service anywhere, Frenchie's is more than just a deli, it's perspective on life.   GOAT ;)"}
