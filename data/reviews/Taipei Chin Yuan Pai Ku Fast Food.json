{"text":"This eatery is simply a storefront that's part of the food court at Metro Square Plaza, and its visual presentation is pretty chaotic.  You can see the six, seven people crowded in the kitchen in the back, and the food signs are all over the place.  But, the food is quite good.    While its calling card is its \"Chin Yuan Spare RIbs\", that dish (it's actually a pork chop, not ribs) is okay but not spectacular.  What's really good is the chicken, which uses the same flavourings and is very, very tasty.  The side dishes nearly steal the show -- you get a marinated egg, and a small but very delicious portion of tofu that's soaked in the same sauce as the meat, and the texture and taste of this tofu is nearly enough to bring me back.  The prices are great, under seven dollars for the food (no drinks included, however)."}
{"text":"My go to place for quick and dirty Taiwanese lunch box meals. The side dishes are fixed.  They've stopped including the soup/soy milk. Now it's 50c/75c extra.   I rotate between this place and the other taiwanese lunch box take out place in the same plaza (between Asian legend and bakery) coz the other place lets you pick 3 side dishes.   IMO this place used to taste a lot better a year or so ago.. hmmm.. my suspicions were confirmed after reading some of the reviews that the owner may have changed."}
{"text":"I used to go here for takeouts a lot.  But it's portion size definitely decrease over the time. They also take out the drinks that supposedly come with the meal.  Most importantly the meat I got is only about 1/2 of what I got when I first found this place. Meats still tastes pretty nice but veggies and eggs comes as sides doesn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and excellent food. Pork on the steam rice, chicken fillet on the rice and beef braised is MUST TRY! The food here is addictive and unforgettable"}
{"text":"A friend of mine from downtown Toronto highly recommended this Taiwanese food court place to me a while ago.  I'd though that since it's a recommendation from someone who goes to The Chase and Ki on a weekly basis, the food is bound to be at least good?     The average... Usually the fried meat, whether it's the pork chop or chicken leg that you order, is not too oily nor meagerly portioned.  However, it's the only restaurant that I ran into that served soggy, mushy rice to customers.  There was also once when I've refrigerated a bento box overnight, the tofu side dish went sour by the next morning; which makes me wonder if the restaurant regularly reuse their side dishes.  Lastly, the mature lady behind the cash register never smiles.  Why am I the one having to smile, say thank you, AND hand you my hard earned money?"}
{"text":"I am from Taiwan and this is one of the best Taiwanese food in the GTA. They have been around for a while and stayed in competition with the modern take on Taiwanese food such as Zen Q and Cha-me-Cha just to name a couple. This place has good selections, pork, beef, chicken. You can have it with rice or noodles. They also have special side dishes that you can order but only on certain days. Their food is delicious in general but the price has been increased consistently over the past years. They even took away the soup which they used to give. This is why I do not give it 5 stars. The service is that of a food court quality. It is not the best. They are very fast with their food and you get a good portion of it."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese fast food. When I come here for lunch, there's always a long lineup. But it's fast. When you find a place in the sitting area, the food will be ready. I'm usually getting pork chop and rice plate with veggie, egg and tofu. It makes me feel I have a balanced lunch even though it's fast food.   During lunch hour, the sitting area of the foodcourt seems to be full. So the tables are cleaned less regularly. And not very easy to find a parking spot"}
{"text":"Came here again for dinner. BIG portion size. Also tried the deep fried chicken, just as good as the pork!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. Located in a food court within a plaza with TONS of yummy food options, this place does not disappoint.   I ordered the grilled pork chop dinner plate for around $7 and change, and it was a huge portion of freshly made food.  The pork was marinated and seasoned very well, and the accompanying side dishes were tasty; especially the soy sauce egg!  You can ask to have your meal spicy, where they add some finely chopped chilis on the side! They are not overly spicy, and I love to add a chili to my spoonful of rice and pork. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Even if there is a line up, the line moves quickly as the menu selection is limited to about 10 items. The first 6 menu items can be ordered with rice or noodles.   While the high turnover ensures food is freshly made, taste wise it was a let down.  Had pork chop on rice #1.  The pork chop was very thin, and a bit on the chewy side.  The side dishes consists of boiled vegetables. a hard boiled egg, and a a bit of tofu. The tofu was very salty.  Also had their chicken fillet noodle soup #6.  The chicken fillet seems to have been pounded thinly before being cooked and sliced.  The noodles were ok, and the broth had a strong garlic flavor.  It all seemed good, until after the meal when my throat felt dry and very thirsty.  A tad too much MSG perhaps?"}
{"text":"The Pork Chop rice used to be authentic, but now it's no longer run by Taiwanese people. There's another store selling Pai Ku rice in the same plaza that's authentic, with many more options.   The Bad: 1. Smaller portions compared to a few years ago with jacked up prices 2. Very oily (yes, I know it's deep fried pork) but there was also grease in my noodle  3. Soup on the side tasted like tomato water with a few pieces of tofu inside 4. Good luck finding a parking spot in this plaza (metro square)  The Good: 1. Side condiments still go best with their rice 2. Always pick soy milk as the drinks option rather than the soup, trust me."}
{"text":"For me, it's a toss up between Chin Yuan and Tai Ping Hsiang which is just around the corner. They are both good places for a quick take-out Chinese bento boxes and they both offer authentic Taiwanese food that tastes great. The difference for me is that Chin Yuan just gives you the side veggie dishes whereas Tai Ping Hsiang gives you a choice of three sides (but if you go late, there's usually not much choices left). Sometimes, I just want my food and don't want to choose, so Chin Yuan makes it super easy. I like this place for the simple fact that it brings me back childhood memories of when I was in Taiwan, so yes, it's that authentic. Definitely recommend this place for a non-fancy, quick lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"First off, one word of advice. If the lady asks you \"Spicy?\" say no, unless you can handle the sliced chili peppers they will ladle on top of your meal. It's delicious, but VERY SPICY. I was sweating up a gold medal with my runny nose bringing home the silver.   Okay, with that out of the way, let me say this spot is a gem. Small menu, specialized, fast, inexpensive, and down-right tasty!   For just over $7 you get a take out box stuffed with white rice, deep-fried meat of your choice, stewed tofu and cabbage, and a hard boiled tea-egg. For a few quarters more they will throw in a cup of refreshing soy-milk (a must if you are going the spicy-route). The portions are ample and left me feeling quite satisfied, and I'm not a small guy.  The dishes are so full of rich, delicious flavours, full of umami, and I've been told are authentic Taiwanese offerings. If you have any cravings for asian food, this little fast food court joint will please you.   The fried pork chop (#1) is a staple, but I also love the chicken (#2)."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese fastfood place. It is quick, cheap, and the portions will fill you up. I usually order pork or chicken short ribs. For about $8, you get rice, your choice of meat, vegetables (bok choi usually), a taiwanese style egg, and some taiwanese pickles. They used to give a soup or soy milk with the meal, but this is no longer the case. The short ribs are good while they are hot, but they are greasy and definitely not too good for health in the long term (hence, fast food). Also, this place usually closes the latest out of all the metro square food court stalls (around 8pm). Overall, this is my go to fast food place in Metro Square."}
{"text":"Came to buy a pork chop rice to go. It's only $7.05 inc tax. You get a fried pork chop, rice or noodles, boiled egg and some green veg. You get a choice of soya milk or daily soup too. The rice boxes are fine. The beef noodle soup is not so good. Pigs feet used to be good but they gave us pork hock last time, not the feet. Always a big line up, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Since the change of ownership, food taste and quality has gone way down. Got the pork chop rice, veggies were raw and meat was full of fat"}
{"text":"Make that a 4.5 actually. Place was a random find. Ordered the food by their recommendation and boy was it worth it. The no 1 pork combo is awesome. Crispy on the outside & soft on the inside yummm. Also their home made chilli sauce is an awesome side with the rice and lightly pickled veggies add an amazing sweetness. You get a choice of soup or soya milk with it. Go for the soya milk as the soup was not that good. (Lumps of tofu in chicken broth).  As for the person behind the counter; she was awesome and did not make us feel like an outsider since we were the only non Asians their."}
{"text":"Combination($5.50) - Rice Noodle Soup, Deep Fried Tofu, Pig Intestine http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/V_fa8HiyVDebFLbym--npQ?select=jQdZhzBct5QNVYD2N1441Q  If you want to try this and not fluent in Chinese.  Visit after 3:30 pm. Point to the YELLOW Sign on the side and Nod to agree for the Combo.  This reminds me of a TW Nightmarket version of Pig Intestine with Thin Noodle Soup but this uses Rice Noodle and doesn't place the Intestine within the Noodle Soup itself.  The sweet sauce on the Intestine is similar to the version of Cantonese Deep-fried Intestine.  I will say that the Intestine served is much cleaner than my own.   ;D"}
{"text":"Was passing by and needed a quick bite.   It's located in the food court in Metro square.  A lot of people were ordering from here compared to the other stands.   Tried their combo 1 which was pork chop. It came with a marinated egg, pork chop cut into a couple of pieces, some stir fry vegetables, and some tofu side.  The sauce from the tofu went well with the rice.    The pork chop was pretty moist and flavourful.    Not bad for $6.50 plus tax.  Didn't come with anything to drink, or any soup.   Not bad for a quick bite, the food came really quickly after ordering."}
{"text":"I ordered their pork chop with rice the other day and was fairly underwhelmed. It looks like a really large box of food. There's a soy marinated egg, some slices of firm tofu, a side of sauteed cabbage and carrots, a pork chop sitting atop a few pieces of fried tofu, and rice. The tofu and veggie sides were not particularly impressive. The pork chop was fairly thin and it wasn't very big. The fried tofu hidden under it gave the impression that there was more pork than there was. The pork itself was oddly sticky. I don't think I've ever described meat that way before. It was almost like jerky sticky, but also like gummy candy sticky. It was not what I was expecting, and not in a good way. The rice was also sticky, in an overcooked way. Yeah. If I had one word to describe this food experience, it'd be sticky. Sigh."}
{"text":"always a line up.  Got the fried pork chop rice and brisket soup noodle.  10 min since there was a long line up at lunch. Good portion and value for pork chop rice.  Comes with veggies and soya egg.  Brisket noodle had large portion of noodle.  Good portion of meat. Excellent value.  No wonder always a line up."}
{"text":"This is also a very authentic taiwanese restaurant. I usually get the pork chop on rice or their braised beef in soup noodle. If I want the popcorn chicken I usually go to the other taiwanese restaurant, as I think their chicken doesn't taste as good as their other meats. Portions are good. The rice meal comes with an egg, some vegetables, and some sort of tofu. The meat is always fresh and always flavourful. The noodle is good as well. It comes with alot of meat, vegetable, and noodles. If you like spicy, rememeber to add their chilli oil located beside the cashier."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????cut??????????????????????dd.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Really love their beef noodle soup! Soooo good! And u will get a meal with a soya drink for $6.45 plus tax."}
{"text":"This fast food stall is located inside the food court in Metro Square. Out of the many times I've been here during lunch and occasionally for a quite bite for dinner, they are the busiest in the whole food court. That should tell you something right?  Their menu is short, but sweet because they have some Taiwanese favourites such as Pork Chop with Rice, Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, and Brisket.   I always go with either the Brisket with Rice, or the Popcorn Chicken with Rice. The Brisket is braised and stewed with some veggies and the result is fantastic. Tender and flavourful, brisket, in a nice rich sauce, on top of some white rice. The Popcorn Chicken however, is the best thing they have imo. It's so crispy, and juicy! It's pretty addicting as well. For $7.25 taxes included, it comes in a pretty big portion with an egg, stir fried veggies and rice. Unfortunately, it used to come with your choice of soup or soya bean drink but not anymore. They ask you if you want spicy or not, and spicy is literally chopped up hot peppers, but boy was it good!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place a while back and I've been coming here whenever I'm around the area ever since. Well balance cheap and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Located inside the metro plaza food court. Been here many times. Tried the pork chop and chicken steak. It's very very good for a stall in a food court. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten in this food court since I worked in the area around 20 years ago but I found myself in the neighbourhood and it was lunch time.  Not every vendor was open but I ended up choosing a pork dish with rice. I had barely put my change in my pocket when my order was ready. That was fast. Wait a second. This looked nothing like the nicely braised pork belly in the picture on their menu. Did I get the right dish?  I didn't bother questioning it because it was cheap, I was hungry, and there was already a language barrier when I placed my order. I probably shouldn't have judged this book by its cover. It tasted a heck of a lot better than it looked! There were pieces of tender pork ribs and belly, bamboo shoots, veggies, a hard boiled egg, and steamed rice. It wasn't very pretty but it tasted good. That's what counts in the end."}
{"text":"Simple food done well at a great price and large portions. The quality and quantity of food is on the better side of food court options. The set meals come with two types of vegetables, a mix of tofu and a marinated egg. Add in the self-serve pickled green vegetables or chilli sauce and there is plenty of flavor variety in a simple combo meal. This is definitely the busiest store in the whole food court, but they are fast with filling orders to the wait isn't too long.  I had the three cup chicken, which was well seasoned and on the sweeter spectrum of sauces. Also, this one is probably the one combo with the most sauce, plenty enough to mix into your rice. If you are lucky enough to get the little nuggets of cooked garlic, that is even better.  Unfortunately, the meals don't come with a drink anymore so bring your own or throw in an extra dollar for a drink."}
{"text":"York Region Notation: Public health inspectors handed out tickets for violations under the province's Health Protection and Promotion Act on July 12 with failing to protect food from contamination or adulteration."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant to eat at the Metro Square. It is the first booth at the food court by the window.   They are well known for their Taiwan style deep fried pork chop (#1 item on the menu, $7.25).  Over the years however, I find that their portions gradually becomes smaller and smaller, and now they no longer come with complementary soup and soy bean milk with the dish.   The pork chops still taste amazing though, so I would recommend just buy them for take home and skip the combos"}
{"text":"Easiest 4 stars I've ever given. Though I'll be honest it deserves a 4.5!   This place was literally picked from the five in the food court on a whim. An wasn't I glad. Ordered the combo #1 pork chops with rice an soup and the combo no 8 shrimp with fried rice and soya milk. First things. Soup was bad. Just some watered down broth with little specks of tofu.   The rest was delicious. I loved the soya milk. Perfect temp. Amazing helpful and cheerful staff. The pork chops were cooked perfectly, juicy and moist on the inside with crispy skin on the outside. The shrimp were proper sized and seasoned. The fried rice was a thing of beauty. Not saturated with soya or veggies. A well balanced flavour. I'll admit I added hot sauce to mine as their spicy wasn't enough for me but all in all delicious.   Def a place I'd come back to.. If I make it through the 45 min drive to Markham...."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Hold on your horses, I can't give this place 4 stars.  I'm not a huge fan of pork chop, hence that eliminates the option of #1 for me. My dad always enjoys it though, and if I were to base it squarely on that I would give 4 stars.  I decided to have the braised beef noodle soup (forgot the number...#6 I think?). The portions were gigantic, and honestly I only wanted something light to fill me up, but this ended up filling me until way past dinner. The noodle felt like thick Japanese ramen, but I do know authentic Taiwanese noodles are somewhat like that. The veggies and beef were also very good, however I found there wasn't enough broth as the noodles soaked up a lot of the broth as I was eating (maybe that's why I failed to finish it). Even the broth itself was quite MSGy and salty, but I expected that in terms of food court standards. I still prefer Pa Pa Chang's and Mei Nung over this one, but it's definitely worth the value.  The soup that comes with it is quite blah. You're better off just dumping it away or having soy milk.  The cashier was quite direct and efficient, but had this mean tone as well. Again, I sort of expected it considering the fast food/food court/Asian setting.  This is usually the busiest stall in the Metro Square food court, and with good reason. It's certainly unique amongst the other places, as there aren't many Taiwanese restaurants in the GTA (I can only think of three out of the top of my head). If I were in the food court and want something with soup or something warm, I definitely would come here."}
{"text":"Ahh....pork rib rice....This is the place I think of when I think of pork chop riche in the GTA, as there are not much variety at this place, and this is what they are named after.  This is the kind of pork rib that you get in a bento box when you take the train in Taiwan.  It's different than the pork chop you will find at Cha Me Cha, as it's cooked in a different style, and this place IS the best in this style of pork chop.  The soup that they give you is tasty, and the tofu that comes with the rice is also very flavorful, slowly stewed for hours.  The 3 cup chicken isn't as good though, so if you go there, just order the Pork rib rice and you can't go wrong.  I give it a 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"Words to describe this food court sensation: cheap,  good side dishes, large portion. $6-$7 for choice of meat comes with fixed vegetable, one whole marinated egg and marinated tofu. Sadly no drink but great deal with yummy sides!   I always get their #1 pork chop option no spicy. Their homemade chilli sauce is a killer so don't ask for spicy unless you can really handle it.   The chicken leg option is inconsistent but still good. Never tried anything else in the food court but you know this place is good since there's always people lining up."}
{"text":"Always seems to be a line during lunch hours. I've only tried combo #1 and combo #6.   I prefer #1, you can choose spicy or not. Only difference is a splash of chili like sauce if you choose spicy. You can also pick soup or soy milk.   The portions are pretty generous I would say. There are usually 1.5-2 pieces of pork chop with veggies, tofu and an egg (with rice) of course. Because of the lines sometimes the wait could be 5-10 minutes during the 12-1:20pm lunch hour it seems. Seating can also be an issue but usually I just grab take out.  The pork chop is breaded interestingly, maybe its a taiwan style breading and its lightly fried. The total cost with tax I think its $7.05 which seem pretty good. Never tried many of the other places in the food court since this place always has a line so it must be good :)  Its not stellar but I guess I'll need to go to other taiwanese places before re-reviewing this place. Probably a 3.5-4 but I wouldn't recommend tourists to drive all the way here for the food hence will leave it at 3 for now."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now since I was a little kid. We get takeout every week because it's so good!! We always get the pork chop on rice (HIGHLY recommended). Usually I also add red chilli for extra spice. It's inexpensive and the portions are huge. They use to have a drink that comes with a dish but now they charge $1 I think. Cold lemon tea is really good if you want a drink. Just a tip to avoid line ups as it does get really busy, try calling beforehand to have it ready for pick up. It's in a food court so there's also seats available to dine in, and food is usually made quick (within 5 minutes). It's also cash only!"}
{"text":"The second of the two Taiwanese pork chop bento boxes available at Metro (and only good ones in all of GTA). This one is slightly different from Tai Ping Hsiang down the street as it's a foodcourt joint and does not allow you to choose your own sides. I always get their chicken chops, and the sides always comes with nappa, shanghai bok choy, a whole braised egg, and some stewed tofu. I always end up just eatting the nappa and the meat and rice - the rest are okay. Their home-made spicy condiment is REALLY spicy so you gotta be careful and ask for it on the side, they will give you a little box.  You can't miss this place as it is the only one here with a line. It used to be owned by a taiwanese woman with her daughters working the front. She's passed on the ownership now to her son-in-law who works in the kitchen. Still Taiwanese as far as I know."}
{"text":"\"Pai Ku\" = Pork Chop  So of course I need to order their \"famous\" Taiwanese Pai Ku with noodle ($6.25) that includes a soup or a soy bean drink.  The Pork Chop itself is moist and tender. The batter reminds me of the 5 spice seasonings which is quite savory and it goes well with the preserved chili that serves with the meat, if you order spicy!  However, I don't really enjoy the noodles, a little to soggy and oily and lack of real flavour. Next time, I think I will go with rice instead.  Maybe I have to come back for their after 3 pm specials, Pig Intestine Please!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place for pork chop! Super fast service and huge portion. The meat is delicious and the side dishes they give (cabbage, tofu, bamboo shoot) are very tasty, too! It is now my go to place to pick up something quick and filling for work when I'm too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Ordered #6 & #7. #6 was delicious - sweet, sticky chicken.  #7 was a meh/not bad - brisket noodles are decent."}
{"text":"Love this place. Portion seems to become smaller but quality still the same.   Recommend getting the chicken or pork chop with rice!  Tender and juicy is all I can say"}
{"text":"got an order to go.  specifically asked for noodles instead of rice, repeated it like 5 times. still got rice with my order. piss poor service"}
{"text":"Definitely ONE OF A KIND! Their pork chop is definitely unmatchable in Toronto and it comes with an egg and veggies and a drink for $7.06 all in! Its located in the food court when im always aching for some good TW food I would always hit this place up as it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend excepting some sort of Taiwanese food. But to my surprise it was just cheap flavourless fried pork chop which they call \"spare ribs\" in Chinese t.t and water boiled veggies on rice with a 1/2 decent taiwense tea egg. Soory for all the reviews, but this place sucks. The lady at the counter was rude and had a voice that was like she was fed up with her job. Disappointing, the soup only had 1 sliver of tofu and barely taste of egg and tomato. Never coming back. If I could I give it zero."}
