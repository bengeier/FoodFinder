{"text":"The hubby and I had a great time here tonight. The service was good, our waiter was very funny and the food was delicious. No complaints! We will most certainly be returning to this location. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. These guys will go out of their way to help you. I prefer this location to any other location in Mississauga since it is not as busy bf the service has been far better than other Keg locations mainly due to less traffic. The restaurant is in a good location with ample parking."}
{"text":"Service and food are always great. I Had the ribs for the first time and they delivered.  The rib sauce and slaw are great."}
{"text":"Unlike some previous reviews, the food is fabulous and the service is exemplary. Over the last 3 years, I have chosen a place for dinner on my birthday.  The spots are usually comparable to the keg price wise and I have always been upset with the service and or quality of food.  I have been so upset that I only go to the keg now for my birthday dinners.  My boyfriends birthday is only a few days after mine and we usually end up at the keg for my boyfriends birthday dinner and have never been upset in the least! Drinks are kept full, staff are courteous and thoughtful, they make pleasurable small talk that meets the mood of the table, they don't ask you how the food is when you have only just out the first bite in your mouth, they make sure you don't need anything else!  Yesterday I was at the keg for my birthday and I had the blue cheese filet along with the escargot.  I really enjoyed both platters! The mashed potatoes were perfectly creamy and fluffy, the meat was cooked perfectly for me (medium) and the food was the perfect temperature.  My boyfriend had the bacon wrapped scallops and prime rib with mashed potatoes and he loved the dish! It was perfect! The meat was so tender for both of us.  I really wonder how they can have such perfect cooks on the meat time after time! When it snuck out that we were there celebrating my birthday our waiter Tony was so happy and he went off to get me a piece of cake! He put a candle on it and everything! He showed up with billy miner cake.  It was very tasty! I couldn't have asked for a more amazing dinner out for my birthday. The food was very timely, perfect, tasty and just the best! If there are any of you here who have had a bad or sub par experience here I highly suggest you give it another shot.  You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Ordered a $38 steak (rib eye) and it was hard and chewy. My wife's pilaf had a hair which they changed. Good service but food was not worth the price and I was very concerned about their hygiene standards after discovering a piece of human hair in the dish. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. We showed up on a Friday at 6pm with a party of 5, one 35 weeks pregnant tell other a 6 year old. We were seated in 2 minutes. 
Our waiter was prompt and attentive. 
The steak I had was okay but that was due to me making an error when ordering. I confused the New York strip with ribeye. I usually have and love the New York strip. 
The starter and dessert was amazing as usual."}
{"text":"Really nice setup inside.  The usual keg!  I always ho for the surf and turf. Always done right and service us great"}
{"text":"Sirloin steak with shrimp tempura was really good. Highly recommend this place to anybody who is here visiting on a business trip or just looking for a good steak house. Price were reasonable.  Service are very attentive to customers.  Would go back to this place next time I visit from Southern California."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The menu looks great, but the basics are lacking. Like getting a glass of water refilled. Or being able to cut meat off the ribs without having to bend the steak knife. Or adding some moisture to the coleslaw so you don't just taste it's all onions. Came here to celebrate my birthday, but it was clearly a mistake. The food is not tasty and not well prepared. To top it off, there are flies circling the table. Yuck."}
{"text":"This is our go-to location almost any time we want to celebrate! Service is always top notch and the staff are very knowledgeable about the food, drinks and allergens. Steaks cooked perfectly and everything so flavourful. Management often checks in to make sure  all is going well. My favorite meal is the NY steak with Ceasar salad, mashed potato, and a huge shrimp skewer thrown on top. We recently tried another steakhouse and were disappointed in the taste and quality there.... I won't be straying from this Keg again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me out to The Keg last night for my birthday dinner. It was actually my first time going to The Keg.

The drink I ordered was delicious - the white sangria. It had mint in it which I thought was a really nice touch. We had the baked brie for an appetizer, it was amazing.

Our server was so kind, checked on us often, as well as helpful when making decisions on what to choose on the menu.

For the main, I had the Sirloin Oscar. The steak was delicious, although I was not very happy with the rest. I am not a picky person what so ever. shrimp, scallops, mashed potatoes and especially asparagus are some of my very most favorite foods. I was disappointed because the asparagus was very soft and mushy and my shrimp were very plain as though they were only boiled. The garlic mashed potatoes had wonderful flavor but were like mush as well...the scallops were very good :)

Overall considering the wonderful service, amazing drink & appetizer (and the steak) it was a good experience. I will be back again to try :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of The Keg for the last 10 years and have religiously returned for a meal here for dates and special occasions.  My favourite steak is the baseball steak and no other restaurant can grill such a thick cut like The Keg can (at this price range).  

Over the years, prices have gone up while the portions have come down.  My most recent visit was really disappointing as their \"seasonal vegetables\" side literally consisted of 2 string beans.  In the past, they served a half tomato with baked cheese - are tomatoes really that expensive to throw in these days?  

With the higher price point now, I will likely try out other steakhouses that may be a few dollars more but supposedly better (eg Canyon Creek)."}
{"text":"Great time, great service, great food... the staff really goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. Kudos to the management. Love the prime rib, twice baked potatoe and fresh bread. The nachos here are also pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner at this Keg Restaurant last night. Three of us are high school buddies from the 1960's and we & our wives get together about 3 times per year. This was a great spot for our dinner and socializing. The waiter was great. He didn't rush us, but he was responsive to all our requests. Everyone enjoyed their food, from salads, the calamari, to ribs & chicken, to prime rib sliders, salmon and one had a Keg burger. We stayed from 6pm to almost 11pm and just had a ball. Highly recommended for any sort of gathering you are planning"}
{"text":"Especially by any chain restaurant standard, The Keg is a winner. Went for business lunch and everything we ordered was nicely served with prompt and friendly service. The tacos were to die for, iceberg wedge salad will not disappoint and my rib eye was near big city steak house caliber."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!

The service and food are always amazing, come here at least once a month with co-workers or friends and have always had a great time.  Martinis are great, only complaint is the ice in them!!!! Otherwise I love the fresh bread, apps, dinner items, drink selection.  Garlic mashed potatoes are crazy good!!! Always a good time, atmosphere, service and meal!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Gone are the days where every thing is a la carte. Portions are huge. Had the fillet mignon dinner. Perfectly cooked steak. Loved the twice baked potato. My husband has the rib steak at the suggestion of our server. It was huge. He wasn't disappointed. Is pricey and not a place we would frequent a lot for this reason however we got what we paid for. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse knows what they are doing.

It was a very busy Saturday evening. The hostess warned my party of four that it would be a 30 minute wait. We were given a pager and waited at the front door. After 25 minutes of waiting, we were seated so I'd have to say their estimates on waiting time were pretty good.

Our server was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu. We ordered a variation of Top Sirloin, New York steak, and Prime Rib and whatever side dishes we wanted. They all tasted fantastic and cooked to our perfection.

The best part of The Keg was their level of service. Not aggressive with beverage sales, always checked up on us if we needed anything, and the food came out in good timing on a busy night. We have found a new favourite steakhouse.

{"text":"I always enjoy my meal at the keg. It is quite a full plate of food. This is a special dinner for us. On birthdays and anniversaries,we always go. The service is usually quite friendly. I just Love their billy miner pie to share with my husband. It's an A+ for me"}
{"text":"Wow. We decided to celebrate a birthday, five of us. Friendly, prompt and discrete service. Surprisingly excellent food. We all had prime rib, perfectly prepared. A simple but very savoury Caesar salad. Piping hot garlic mashed potatoes. Jus on the side. Stupendous horse radish. Terrific mushrooms and vegetables. With tax and generous tip, including a couple of glasses of beer and just one modest bottle of wine, and no desserts, it came to about $65 per person. But the bottom line was that it was one of the best restaurant meals in memory. All of us were quite thrilled. Remarkably, it was an ordinary Monday night on a wintry February day yet the huge place was packed to the rafters, with dozens of additional people waiting in the lobby for a table. Reservations recommended for sure. It was difficult to get them to answer the phone but once they did, they were very responsive (I had broken my leg so we needed a table with extra leg room). Just a great all-round experience."}
{"text":"Here we are again to celebrate as a group.  And once again they hit this one out of the park.  This time around it was my mothers 74th birthday and this was her choice of restaurant for her special day.  Before i talk about the food i just wanted to say the server, Lucas was a true pro and one of the best i have seen.  Attentive, and efficient and made this special day a true pleasure.  This fellow should be teaching what good service is all about.  Now for the food, between us all it seemed that we gravitated towards the same appetizer with the french onion soup and we cant forget their complimentary sour dough bread, and as an added bonus our waiter brought us some of the three cheese butter my son and i love so much.  Yup its not just for potatoes anymore.  It rocks the sourdough bread too.  For entres, again we were all similar in choices, some of had the prime rib, which was prepared to each persons expectations and served with your choice of potatoe and it seemed i was the only one who chose the standard baked potatoe even though everyone else dove into the twice baked and also the prime rib camed with their deep fried onions which are always a delicious addition to any meal.  My yelper helper had the teriyaki sirloin and raved about it, so this is a bonus, because he knows his steak.  Again he had the twice baked with a hefty addition of bacon to top it off.  Lastly, the steak oscar.   Now i had second thoughts once i saw the juicy steak smothered in seafood and sauce.  I wish i could say i got to taste that one but nope, nobody wanted to share.  Pfffftttttt next time i wont ask. I'll just sneak a taste when they are not looking.  Now back to our waiter, even though this was a fairly low key event he still brought the traditional Billy Minor pie and candle, and that was something we all had a taste of, then off to our individual deserts, too numerous to mention but i did split a brownie sundae with my son and that was a fine way to top off this festive family lunch.  The keg sure made this a great experience and we hope to return again soon.  The food was great and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"It was a snowy evening and the roads were bad.  We were supposed to go to my employers Christmas party, but I wasn't going to drive 40km on slippery roads, so we went to our local Keg Instead.

With all of the construction for the Marshall's and the new TD branch there is now insufficient parking.  We had to park in the TD parking lot as the keg lot was full. (If anyone here is Keg management please chew out Smart centres).  We got inside and were seated without a wait.

For appetizers my wife had a regular sized Caeser, and commented that she should have ordered the keg sized one, and I had a beer.

On to the main courses.  We both ordered the keg special prime rib, she had hers with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad, and mine was ordered with veggies and salad as well.  Of course the steak was cooked to our liking and tasted great.  I was warned that the horseradish was a little otter than usual.  That didn't stop me from slathering it on like a barbarian.  Needles to say my sinuses have been clear for a week.

We skipped on dessert.  The total bill was around $90 including tax and tip. A little high but par for the course for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"great service, great food, perfect staff, prices awesome, will eat there anytime! went there for my Bday and it was awesome. love the decor, atmosphere is nice cozy! steak outta dis world! but hours needs to be improved as they close at 11pm ! duh! othjer then that that nice place will visiit again! cheers!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and customer service was great. I ordered the keg burger and it was decent, didn't blow me away. The best part of the dinner was the fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"TBH I've been to so many Kegs and the food varies from one to another but the service is always great. I think for most restaurants now where it's about quantity or quality it shows... in The Keg I see quality for sure. 

Was there yesterday for yet another family member's birthday, Daddy's 65th!

The reservation was easy even if it was 30 mins prior for 10 people. We had Jenny serving us the whole time and she was consistent. Not always easy dining out with 2 toddlers and a large...louder family. She made it even better. The whole process from ordering earlier for the kids, switching their seats around and all the food sharing was facilitated well by her and other staff. 

Not saying as much for the older couple sitting in front of us that I kept having to have a staring contest with as she sat judging my sister and her gf...stay home ppl if you can't deal with life

kk back to Jenny...

She consistently checked up on us and always with a smile on her face. She was knowledgeable about the wine list and made a great recommendation. 

The food itself was great, my whole family enjoyed everything from apps to dessert. I'm a vegetarian and she offered to accommodate with a stir fry but I went with her other recommendation of sides. Mashed potatoes and grilled veggies for $7, can't beat that!

All in all it was a great meal and I'm glad to see new veg options on the menu (korean fried cauliflower, cauliflower steak) but definitely missing the old Keg salad!!!

Thanks for another great experience Mississauga North West Keg!"}
{"text":"The one thing I like best about dining at The Keg is the exceptional service at all of them.  

We were meeting up with friends and I wasn't too hungry.  So I ordered their Sliders.  Absolutely love the horseradish.  Split the Caesar Salad with my wife and it was perfect too.  Just the right about of dressing.   I like anchovies but that isn't an option.  

Another great dining experience at The Keg.  

One of my favourite chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Took my parents out for a celebratory dinner, good, fast service...the mushroom neptune and garlic shrimp appetizers were really good, flavourful and lots of sauce to dip with your complimentary bread.  My parents ordered the oscar steak and they loved it.

I had the teriyaki sirloin with asiago rice and both were amazing, might be the best cooked steak I've ever had!  I ordered medium and it was cooked to perfection and the wine sauce with the teriyaki was practically infused into the steak.  Definitely the best Keg I've been to."}
{"text":"Loved it! 

Delicious salmon and vegetables. Nice patio for outdoor seating. Staff was attentive and service quick. 

Portions were large. 

Moderately priced.

Everything I want!"}
{"text":"I'll give three stars for the apps, atmosphere, service, but I have to subtract from 5 because it is a steak place and the steaks were not incredible.  I had the t- bone special and it was thin, not flavorable, not cooked well, and certainly not a great cut.  I have had much better.  Other is my party didn't get the steak and enjoyed it. But everyone who got the steak said the same thing I did"}
{"text":"Went here for a Christmas dinner for a work function and I was not impressed had some bland salmon and an apple cake with icecream   food was bland and dessert was nothing special!! was not a fan  hence i haven't visited since! i make better fish at home"}
{"text":"Excellent. The restrooms are a good test of the restaurant's cleanliness. This Keg was impeccable. Appetizers and main dishes were delicious. I had the 20oz rib steak medium rare. Wife had the 12oz top sirloin. Both done perfectly. Bacon wrapped scallops and garlic butter shrimp. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening with some friends. It was a busy dining room so we got  seated in the lounge.
The food was good. The steaks were cooked perfectly to order. But service was poor. 
Our steaks were served without steak knives and our waitress seemed a bit too preoccupied to look after us. Maybe she was too busy looking after the patio diners.

Overall, the food was good, but the service was not very good."}
{"text":"My mom's is better.



I actually want to leave my review at that but I'll elaborate.
I'm not a fan of The Keg but when I'm forced to go here I don't hate it. I just don't like it either.
The seats are comfy, it's nice and dark inside, but every time I go (and to different locations too) I find the meat bland. I've only tried the steak and prime rib. 
The baked potato was okay and the dessert was nothing to gush over.
The appetizers never wow me.
I usually end up at this one or the one in Brampton for birthdays.
I never get excited.
(Such a downer, I know!)."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally go here because it's just way too expensive for a normal meal out. Our dinner ended up being close to $110 for 2 people and I didn't have any alcohol. It's tasty with great service but for that price, it better be! I will admit that it's better than the other steak chain (Canyon Creek) but it's practically double the price. We got the prime rib meal and also the tenderloin. Both of them was done to our liking and they were very tender. We can't complain about the meat. I just wish this wasn't so outrageously expensive!"}
{"text":"This location has very good service. The wait staff are friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable & attentive. Although, the times I have dined herehere the food has taken a pretty long time afterr the appitzers. Also, they do not take reservations on weekends so this is a challenge becuase we have a big family with 2 infants. 

I love the variety on the menu because I dont necessarliy always want steak. I usually go for salmon or chicken and love the veggies & twice baked. The BM pie is the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's just after 11:00pm at the time of this review, I have just arrived home from a late dinner with my wife.  I will be dreaming of this meal once I succumb to the food coma I am about to experience.  

The food was amazing.  I started off with a French Onion Soup.  My main course was the baseball top sirloin which was cooked perfectly, medium rare inside.  I also asked for it Chicago Style, so it was nice and crispy on the outside.  For dessert I had a delicious creme brulee.

Our server, Olivia was excellent.  She answered all of our questions, spaced out our courses, and was at our table to make a quality check within a few bites of each course - her timing was impeccable.

Overall this was a fantastic experience and I am so glad I got to share it with my wife."}
{"text":"The bartender at my hotel recommended this place and I'm glad she did! Food was amazing. Salmon was cooked perfectly and the drinks were delicious. Service was great too. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to The Keg more times than I ever had in the last two months and I really enjoy the food here. It's always consistent and tasty for me. I deducted a star for my latest visit because our waitress didn't check up on us as much as she should have, but she still did well. We sat on the bar side this time around. I think we had to wait maybe 10 minutes for our table.

We had the Bacon Wrapped Scallops (like always, $12) and it's so simple but so tasty. Ugh, kind of wish I didn't share it with my friend LOL. I got the 8 oz. Top Sirloin ($34), rare, with veggies and a twice baked potato. When it arrived it smelled amazing and was cooked to perfection! The twice baked potato was made very well, one of the better ones I've had. We also got a bottle of Woodbridge White Zinfandel ($26) and it was perfectly chilled. Our waitress did top up our glasses as we finished our glasses.

For dessert we got a slice of the Billy Miner Pie ($6) to share and it was super tasty! Mocha ice cream with a chocolate crust.

Overall I would go back here again if I wanted to splurge on a good meal!"}
