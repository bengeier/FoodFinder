{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted on how to review La Bella.  I'll start be talking about various aspects of the experience.

Drink order: Menu states they have Miller Lite, Bud Light, Coors Lite, and Heineken.  What it really should have said is they only have Corona.  The menu also states to ask your server for a \"variety of wine choices\".  After doing so we found out they also only had one wine, Moscato.  I'm not too fussy when it comes to alcoholic beverage selection but this was a bit odd.  My date wanted wine but had to settle for soda and that was disappointing.

Appetizer: Fried dill pickle chips.  I enjoyed them and would order them again.

Pizza: We ordered the Mama Mia pizza.  We were both a little surprised by how fast it came out.  Initial reaction to the pizza was it looks beautiful and fresh.  Got some slices on our plates and noted that the pizza was not hot.  In fact the pizza dough was a little under cooked.  The vegetable toppings were on the raw side.  Despite all that the pizza did taste good.  Good crust (where cooked), great tasting pizza sauce, and fresh tasting toppings (albeit a bit under cooked).

Service:  Though inexperienced our waitress was very friendly and attentive.

So overall experience I would like to give over 2 stars but honestly I don't feel La Bella deserves it yet.  If our pizza had been cooked properly I believe the pizza alone would have been worthy of 4/5 stars.  This place has a lot of promise and I hope they can work out the rough spots.  I would gladly try it again in maybe a years time."}
{"text":"The place was clean and very well lit, the highlights of the visit. Drove down from Madison and ordered the chicked parm and lasagna with an appetizer of bread sticks. Our side salads never arrived, bread sticks really needed oil for dipping rather than the sauce provided. The entrees were blah, neither one had any flavor or seasoning. Took much of meal home however spouse won't be eating hers because meal gave her acid reflux. Won't be back again!"}
{"text":"Salads were brown and wilted, bread was burnt and tough, chicken dishes were under whelming.  Recommend sticking to their pizza."}
