{"text":"Rossi's is a hidden gem!    If you're just driving by, Rossi's would look like something to pass up because you see the word \"arcade\" in the title, yet all you can see from the road is an air hockey table.  Well, I have two words for you...  GO INSIDE!  Rossi's is awesome!  They have every type of vintage arcade game that you can think of.  My favorites were pinball and Pac-Man, but I also kicked some major ass in air hockey. :)  The pizza looked delicious, but I unfortunately couldn't eat any during my visit.  I heard that the thin crust was amazing and they have interesting topping combinations. While they don't offer beer to drink while playing, this is still a great place to go with friends or family for a game night."}
{"text":"I was in the Monona area and my friends and I were craving pizza so this place showed up on our yelp app. WOW is all I can say! By far the best pizza in town! Very reasonable prices and 110% delicious! They're located across the street from Monona Grove High School and it's not exactly the best location since the streets there were very busy but I'm willing to risk crazy high school traffic for this pizza!  We ordered a 16' specialty pizza which cost us a little over $20 and it was well worth the price. You have the choice of cutting the pizza into triangles or squares which I think awesome. Their thin crust is superb and everything tasted fresh and home made. I've only been here once but I can tell you now that I'm definitely coming back! Rossi's you have a customer for life!  Also, their decor is very unique. It's somewhat dirty but nothing that will turn you away from their pizzeria. I would recommend either taking out or getting deliver (btw, they have free delivery!). The restaurant is personally not a place i would want to sit and enjoy my meal unless I had my children with me, but it's definitely very kid friendly since they're part vintage arcade.  Last advice, GET IN AND EAT HERE! Worth every penny!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Have brought family from out of town, group from work more than once and myself many more times.  Friday we had a group at work that decided to go for pizza.  I suggested Rossi's and two car load headed towards Monona.  I called from the car while on the way to place the order so we wouldn't have to wait so long once we arrived.  I mean, we were like 10 minutes away.  Ross, the owner said I'd have to pre-pay for the order.  I explained we were literally driving there as we spoke.  He then got an attitude, \"I understand that, but I do not put any food in my oven until I see money\".  OK, A) I am driving a car, B) the guys whines about people using a card and not cash (which i planned to pay in cash). and C) give me a break.  I worked pizza joints from NJ, OH, CA and here in WI.  How the hell does one take carry out or delivery orders pre-pay only?  I didn't even know what to say, except, \"OK, never mind then\" to which I was grunted at and hung up on.  We went down the street to Pizza Oven instead.  They have a lunch buffet and plenty of games as well plus they have TVs and beer.  Nice customer friendly service there Ross."}
{"text":"You take a step back in time when you enter Rossi's.  They have an eclectic collection of memorabilia throughout the place for decor which is perfect conversation starters as well as the trivial pursuit cards on each table as well.  The thin crust pizza is a favorite of ours and the bonus of this place besides the pizza is the large selection of vintage arcade games that brings back many great childhood memories of playing them.  Plus the prices to play the games are just as great.  A must stop for some great pizza and games for all ages!"}
{"text":"Ordered a slice of sausage pizza and pepperoni. The meat was generous and tasty.  Lots of nostalgia with the arcade machines!"}
{"text":"My friends and I discovered this great retro arcade and pizzeria place last night. FYI, they have moved down the road to this 4503 Monona Drive address, in a little cluster of shops. Don't go to the 100 Frost Woods address, as it is now a Salad Creations.  Oh my goodness, I fell in love immediately. The space is cozy, the clientele is hip, and it's a cheerful buzz of retro game noise and folks making pizza. I split a 14 inch pepperoni with a friend, and it was just enough for the both of us. When you order, they ask if you want your pizza cut into squares or slices, which is a nice touch. (Squares for me.) The pizza turned out to be a thin crust with plenty of cheese, a bright tomato sauce, and sprinkles of oregano to top it off. It's pretty addictive. I also ordered some Bosco sticks, and while the cheese was a little cool, they satisfied my cheesy breadstick requirements. You can't go wrong with a scoop of Chocolate Shoppe ice cream for dessert. However, the counter service was pretty brusque, which was off-putting.  There's an excellent selection of arcade games, and no worries, there's a change machine for your $1 and $5 bills. Most of the arcade games are only 25 or 50 cents, so you can have a lot of fun on a little money. Here's just a sampling of the original arcade games I saw:  Pacman  Ms. Pacman Qbert Burger Time Donkey Kong Super Mario Rampage Joust Street Fighter Pinball machines (including Dr. Who!) Paperboy  The pinball machines are in the black light room, which is a lot of fun. I truly enjoyed this place. It's a fun retro arcade with great prices and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"We came for the arcade and we weren't disappointed. We had a great time here. The arcade was larger than we expected. Pinball and classic arcade games. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place effing rules.  I brought my nephew here after school on a Friday after school while visiting for the weekend, because I'm the dopest aunt ever. It ruled!  There are two game rooms and they have all the popular classics. The machines are in pretty fantastic condition, although we did have about three quarters eaten by machines.  We ordered pizza and these cheese breadstick things to go upon leaving. They have daily specials (Friday's is two medium pizzas for $21). The cheesesticks were BOMB!!!!! So good. Pizza was great too, although the crust was a little too thick.  Either way, this place rules. A great spot to bring kiddos!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!  Great thin-crust pizza, assorted specialty pizzas and appetizers and other items.  Delivery and take-out.  Cool unique dining area.  Great affordable games.  Friendly service.  Best of the best.  Hopefully the city of Monona gets off of their power trip and gives these guys a beer license!"}
{"text":"Oh, Rossi's! The guy who answers the phone has a silky radio DJ voice. I just want to listen to that guy talk, but then he's asking me whether I want slices or squares, so. Anyway, the pizza. It's pretty damn good. Basic, thin crust, comes in crazy huge sizes if you want a crazy huge pizza. The inside of the place is like stepping back in time 30 years. It seriously feels like 1984 in there (the actual year, not the book)."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm in love.    OK, OK, Rossi's.  You had me at vintage arcade.  But pizzeria, too?  Simply put, this place is no joke.  Calling back to the days where pizzerias and arcades were like hands in gloves, Rossi's happens to score major points, easily reaching a level-10 charm spell.  The arcade selection is choice.  There are games here that I haven't seen since 1988...eg. Paperboy (with the original BMX handlebars!!)  Dig Dug, Rampage, Burgertime.  I could go on.  Mix that with low lighting, black light posters and vinyl records spinning and you got a nostalgia trip like no other.   Now, as if the arcade wasn't good enough, the pizza is supreme.  My wife and I have been searching high and low for the old-school thin crust we'd get in Chicago and Rossi's is hands-down the best we've had yet.  The crust is cracker thin, crispy on the edges and a little softer towards the middle.  The sauce is insanely good...obviously homemade with a delicate balance of acidity, richness and herbal kick.  As well, the cheese compliments all of the above, being slightly sharper than most pies.  We always order our pizza to-go and are sure to give ourselves a good 1/2 hour to hit the arcade, ever time. My advice?  Run, don't walk over to Rossi's."}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust pizza. A black-lit vintage arcade that truly feels like a trip 25 years back in time. Hand-scooped ice cream. Nostalgic ambiance in the dining room. Fast service from incredibly friendly employees. This place is so great! We just moved to the area a month ago and we've already eaten at Rossi's 3 or 4 times without any disappointment. It's always a good day when we decide to go to Rossi's. This place is as fun for my 4 year-old as it is for her 40 year-old daddy. Next time, I'm buying a cool Atari-inspired Rossi's t-shirt!"}
{"text":"EXTERMINATE!  EXTERMINATE!  EXTERMINATE!  When I'm at Rossi's, that's what you'll hear as I'm throwing quarters down the Dr. Who pinball machine. I love those little Daleks up top announcing what an awesome game I'm having.     Rossi's has pretty decent thin crust pizza, tater tots just like from elementary school that you order by the pound, and pop in cans. The most fun part of a visit there is the vintage arcade. The main dining area has a few really old games, an air hockey table, and lots of movie posters and memorabilia on the walls. Then off to the side through a little hallway is the black light filled arcade. All games are only a quarter. There is a change machine if you haven't been hoarding quarters in anticipation of a visit here. The first room has loads of old stand up games. Classics like Joust (for your Ready Player One role playing), original Mario Brothers (the one where you have to jump under the bricks to knock off turtles), Dig Dug, Pac Man, Indiana Jones, and more. The second room had a few more stand up games and four pinball machines. The pinball is 50cents, but put in $1.50 and you'll get extra games. Pinball includes the aforementioned Dr. Who, along with Tales From The Crypt, and two others that I can't recall. This room also has Street Fighter, which I am horrible at, and Tekken which will suck the quarters right out of your pocket. In the summers the arcade rooms can get a bit warm will all the machines producing heat and being crowded with people on weekend nights. I'm sure it will feel toasty and comforting in there come wintertime.  When you are finished playing or if your wrists just need a break, they also serve Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream.  I really think this is one of the hidden gems in Madison, well I guess technically Monona. It's a great activity to do with friends when the weather is crappy outside. Don't let the construction on Monona Dr scare you off. Go and have fun. But if I show up, back away from the Dr. Who pinball because that baby is mine."}
{"text":"Talked to the owner on the phone and he seemed friendly. However, when we got to the restaurant he was anything but friendly. He was rude to my wife and kids and the service was unbelievably slow. The pizza was decent, but the plastic cups and plastic silverware overshadowed the decent food. When the owner of the restaurant is rude to the customers that's not a good sign for a business. I rarely write reviews for restaurants good or bad, but this experience was so terrible I felt I must write a warning for other restaurant goers. Stay away from Rossi's unless you like getting treated like dirt by the owner."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great video games and just a nice cool atmosphere.   All the classics Donkey-Kong, Pac-Man, Galaga, Track and Field, just keep on going."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic. The decor and the arcade options are fabulous for the kids and hubs. But seriously, no ATM? Do you not want my money for the games and such?? Also, the owner is a dick.  I would love to boycott the place because of him and the other issues I mentioned, but the kids love it so I can't"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza is great. Cool, laid back atmosphere. And the games! I love me some pin ball! A family favorite. My daughter has had her birthday party there the last 2 years."}
{"text":"If I could rate them on the video arcade part alone - 5 stars, it's a blast, and that's where the good times end.  The food, which came highly recommended, is TERRIBLE, and this is coming from a guy who can eat pizza every day of the week, frozen, fresh, homemade, you name it.    Greasy, greasy, greasy (my 11 year old AND her friends, all pizza lovers, wouldn't finish it, literally soaked the paper plates they give you for the pizza).  Paper thin, but not crispy unfortunately, crust, so the \"toppings\" slide off.  The \"toppings\" (and reason behind the \" \" marks) mean you'll get about 8 slices of pepperoni on a whole pie apparently.  I've actually never seen pizza as thin as this in my life.  The place is also a dump inside, with only a few tables, smells like movie theater carpeting.  They do most of their business on delivery.  The guy who runs it (Rossi I assume) is a little odd, but nice enough.  It's clearly an institution, I begrudge no one their kitschy place to hang out.  But if someone tells you the food is good, you might want to breathalyze them."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the pizza here, but I was looking for a good arcade and found this one online.  My buddy and I checked it out and we were blown away by the selection of great old arcade games.  Contra, Double Dragon, Raiden, Robotron 2084, Joust, so many great arcade classics.  All were in great shape, so there was none of the usual frustration over a non-responsive joystick.  I will be sure to stop here every time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past sunday, it was pretty busy but the service was great! Brads Buffalo pizza is phenomenal! The arcade games were fun and unique! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Rossi's has kind of lost it's luster with me, unfortunately.  The pizza here is average.  The Margherita pizza we ordered last time was pretty awful.  It featured so many canned tomatoes, that the crust was soggy.  Canned tomatoes on a pizza?  Shame on you, Rossi's!  Yuck.  Also, I have to dock them a star based on the fact that they don't serve alcohol.  The current barcade trend is a wonderful one, but Rossi's isn't part of it.  I know that it'd be far easier to get a group to go there if they served beer.    Going to Rossi's only makes me want to be at Dave & Buster's instead.  The drive to D & B's in Milwaukee would bring me much more joy, honestly. Madison needs a Dave & Busters.  Also, they don't rotate their machines.  There are only so many times I can play Pac-man.  And some of the machines don't function quite how you'd like them to.  Good thing this place is poorly lit, because it's honestly a little junky.  The place has some sort of charm, but it's getting old.  The teenagers that run the place are fine, but not particularly cheerful or pleasant.  After several visits over the years, this place is finally starting to feel very \"meh.\""}
{"text":"I've been to Rossi's a few times now and have never been disappointed. Their thin crust pizza is fantastic, with a perfect crispy crust and really good sauce and toppings. I've ordered whole pies and by the slice when stopping in for lunch and it has always been fresh and delicious. The arcade is amazing and easy to lose a few hours playing all of the classics they have there. The games are in great shape and well maintained with different ones rotated in every so often. Check it out, it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Sure, I go to play the vintage arcade games, but I love the pizza too (cooked on a stone, on a conveyor belt, as advertised). Rossi's also has ice cream.  I love being able to play these old games for just a quarter and pinball for 50 cents. I recently had my birthday party there, and everyone had a great time.  Fair warning on the temperatures... Even with the addition of a A/C in the back room it gets really hot in the back room.I'm looking forward to winter when the heat  won't be an issue.  Fair warning on the games... The games are old and do break down. They are regularly maintained, and new games are being frequently added, but as long as you don't have your heart set on just playing one game, you'll always walk out with pockets empty of coin and a smile on your face."}
{"text":"This place makes an excellent date night or a night out with the family.  The atmosphere is eclectic and fun.  Who doesn't love to play old school video games for mere quarters while consuming large amounts of scrumptious pizza?  If such a person exists, I have no desire to meet them."}
{"text":"Children's of the 80's, rejoice!  You can go home! Walking in, you absolutely feel like stepping back.in time.  The decor screams 1980's.  It is devided into 3 rooms.  Dining room and 2 arcades.    Typical pizza resturant.. Thin cracker crust pizza.  Really good.  There are slice special.  No pitchers.of sodas...they have cans instead.  RC and other lesser known brands.  Bostic chrssy breadsticks were good and the marinana sauce did not disappoint.  The chicken wings are small but are sold by the lbs so not really a factor.  The arcade is so awesome.  It is dark and remomded me of the arcades in the mall during the 80.  All the console games are here.  Quarter change machine completes the time travel.    Walking around, you observe the parents becoming 12 years old again.  While their kids struggle woth these primitive video game.  What?!  A joystick?!..where is the multi-button controller?  Do yourself a favor! Visit and return to the 80s!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. Pizza and video games. Come here. Pretty good thin crust pizza made simply, not over or under cooked. New York style in that it's foldable. $3.50 for slice and a soda. I give that 4 stars. After, go drop some quarters and play Araknoid, Wizard of Wor, Burgertime, Donkey Kong, and lots more. I'm drooling thinking of the games, hence the 5 stars."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!! I seriously try to come here every week, if not more now. Even if I live half and hour away. This place is like a step into the 80s. Decorated neatly, and then when you step into the retro-arcade room you just get a great feeling. Tons of retro machines, where most of them are in good working order. Best of all, most machines are the old 25¢ a play! Another great thing is, the pizza is really good too! Pretty much a perfect place. I mean, the building isnt new or anything, and the bathrooms arn't the cleanest (though, they have a whiteboard inside both of the restrooms where you can draw on and do whatever) its nothing to keep me from coming back to this place! Just love seeing a thriving retro arcade, and wish the best of luck to this place and hope is prospers!"}
{"text":"Rossi's has the best delivery pizza in Madison (and Monona). Their crust is thin and crispy. My wife and I especially like the Spicy Asian Vegetable specialty pizza, although we usually get a 16-inch mushroom and onion, cut into slices. (They also cut in squares, which my wife likes, for reasons I find inexplicable.)  The regular sauce is tangy, with good, even spicing. Delivery is fast, usually about 1/2 hour.  We're not fans of the bosco sticks, and Rossi lets us substitute garlic bread for the Saturday special, and the garlic bread is great.  Rossi's has a super cool arcade. I'm a big pinball fan, and they have four great tables--I especially like Twilight Zone. They have three rooms total--two dedicated entirely to the arcade--and they have almost every game I played when I was a kid.  How can you go wrong? If they served beer, I'd move in. Their web site is hard to find, though, and it's not listed here on Yelp. It's rossispizzaandarcade.com"}
{"text":"**HIDDEN GEM ALERT** The Pizza and garlic bread are great! They have a decent arcade hidden in the back. Downsides, the parking situation and when their busy, you won't find much room to sit."}
{"text":"My new favorite place: the best thin crust pizza I've had in a long, long time- probably the best pizza I've had in Madison. And this place is just fun! Love the games, love the food."}
{"text":"Go for the games, stay for the pizza?  I would say the opposite, but I could always throw down on some Rampage.    I loved Rossis when they had zero  video games and they existed on the underside of Rossario's.  The pizza is fantastic here; stone cooked with interesting combos (wangs cap, swiss pig), friendly service, daily specials and coupons that make you want to try other items; bosco sticks & lasagna.   Home alone on a Sunday, but still want to watch football, eat some good food and have a beer?  Sunday's special is fantastic (it's big for one, but leftovers are great) and I would highly recommend meatballs as a topping.  While they 'talk' back to me a little later, they are amazing.  I also appreciate the humor in their tag line of \"triangles or squares, we have the technology\"  LOL  Great spirited group and they remember what customer service is and how to provide it.  Thank you for being in Monona - We love you!"}
{"text":"Cute, fun, blast from the past. I wasn't impressed with my floppy pizza that I couldn't pick up from the pan. When I asked for utensils I got a plastic fork that just broke in half."}
{"text":"Rossi's is a blast from the past!  I love this arcade and I love their thin crust pizza cut into proper squares.  The place is clean and well maintained unlike the other Madison arcade that I won't mention here."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, awesome arcade games and environment."}
{"text":"A great place to bring the family. The pizza tastes  great and they usually have good deals on something daily. The game room is stocked with lots of classic arcade games. The decor is straight out of my youth in the 70-80's."}
{"text":"Dear Rossi's Pizza,   I really like your product, and I'm walking distance from your front door.   Here's the kicker:  At the top of your menu, you pronounce that you now take credit cards, but then slob on a guilt trip if I decide to use one.   Tell ya what, you marketing aces! If you'd left that bit off and joined the real world, or just say cash only, you'd do a lot better.  I think of you guys all the time, and I'd like to buy from you, but in this day and age, I simply don't carry cash. To let me know at the very top of the menu that you're particular about how you're paid is an insult. If you don't trust me or the issuer of my bank card, relax. I'll spare you the risk by not entering your business. Pizza isn't in short supply around here. I hope your banker is a Yelp member.   Best to you! Figger it out!   Bill"}
{"text":"Brilliant collection of classic arcade games!!"}
{"text":"I love Rossi's!   They deliver, not only on making delicious pizza, but to your door, as well!  Their thin crust is crispy, flaky, and seldom soggy in the middle, when delivered.   Plus, they take checks!  Rossi's rocks!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have a thin crackery crust that's the best in the area for that type. They have some unique toppings, like those French's fried onion straws from the cardboard can. I recommend that. They make a 30 inch pizza. I've never seen one that big. When a couple of those got brought out to a hungry middle school-aged baseball team it made me say \"WHAA...?\"  Yeah, the place is a little dive-y but it's clean and there's lots to look at.   It's always crowded, but I've never had to wait to order, have always been able to find a table, and the pizza comes out quick. It just says that they're doing something right. But if lots of kids and noise bother you, don't go.  The arcade has a lot of games. I wanna say maybe 30? 40? We like all the pinball and the air hokey.   I've dealt with the owner a couple of times and he was never rude to me. I almost wish he was, extremely rude customer service amuses me. I'm not thin skinned and it leaves a story to tell. Strongly prefer that to the fake smiles and scripted welcomes.  There's another pizza arcade place down the street ( The Pizza Oven), but the pizza isn't nearly as good, they have far fewer games (12? 15?), and less than half of those are turned on. No, don't go to The Pizza Oven, go to Rossi's."}
{"text":"I was referred to Rossi's by a friend because of the retro 80's vibe and the nostalgic .25 arcade games ex. PacMan, Galaga, Qbert, etc. It was fun taking the family there to introduce my children to some of the arcade games I played at their age. We had a great time in the arcade area challenging each other to some PacMan, pinball and car racing.  We also stayed for dinner and ordered a 20\" King Kong Bundy pizza and a monster salad. The pizza wasn't nothing to write home about or cause you to want to return for another one. It wasn't terrible either, just average! Same with the salad. It was a basic salad too. A bunch of romaine with a few wedges of tomato, sliced cucumber, croutons and some balsamic vinaigrette.  The reason for the 2 stars is because of the owner. He's probably not the best to have as the person taking the orders and checking people out. He's very intimidating. We were ordering our pizza and he yelled at my son who was checking out some of the kids novelties at the front register area. He was afraid my son was going to break the plastic on the package. He also made us feel terrible for asking for 5 waters. It's not that we didn't spend $30+ dollars on our food and another $10 in the arcade. The owner also yelled at some kids about some coats that were hanging on the back of some chairs that ended up not even being theres. He said I need those chairs and tables because I have 75 people coming in here in the next half hour. There's not even enough seating or parking spaces for 75 people."}
{"text":"Great old-school arcade!  Machines were in pretty good shape-- plenty of arcade games and four pinball machines.  Pizza was pretty good thin crust, and salad was what you would expect at a pizzeria and arcade (iceberg topped with what I would guess is the same cheese that goes on the pizza).  But of course I'm not driving all the way across town for the food here.  Great place to take this kids.  I wish all restaurants like this still had arcades like they used to (my kids don't believe me... believe it, kiddos)."}
{"text":"love the arcade old school fun hadn't played pinbot in 20 yrs very god thin crust pizza my kids love the bosco sticks some of the smallest chicken wings i have had"}
{"text":"Pinball is my thing. Seriously. So I feel pretty strongly about it when I say Rossi's is the most fun place to play pinball in madcity. Trust me. I gotta lot of spent quarters to tell ya I know my stuff.   First of all there are 5 pinball machines here, the most in any one Madison locale! And that's not including the super vintage handfull in the front room. They have Black Knight 2000 (my personal favorite - it has a pretty sweet feature, Magna Save), Dr. Who, Twilight Zone, Tales from the Crypt, and PinBot - a pretty awesome selection, not a bad one in the house. And there are a couple dozen arcade machines to play if you need to step away from the pinball heat and spend your quarters another way. So good, I don't even care that they don't serve beer!"}
{"text":"I had their pizza yesterday and still today, I'm thinking about it. Man I wish I had leftovers but we ate it all there. I'm really picky about the sauce, cheese and crust and this place hit all 3 out of the park. I wish I lived closer- I would go there all the time. Pretty cool vintage game room if you're into that sort of thing. A lot of reviewers are saying the owner is a giant douche. He wasn't there when we were there. Instead a 30-something year old chubby guy served us. He was smiley, friendly and laughed a lot. Didn't catch his name."}
{"text":"Rossi's is a great cold or wet Saturday change of pace thing to do.  We sipped on Dr Pepper, (Rossis is alcohol free) and played Ms Packman. It's a place with lots of vintage arcade games that all take quarters.  Most games are 1 quarter. The most popular is racing cars. Anyway, the FOOD! These honestly have to be some of the best cheese curds have ever had, perfectly fried and not too greasy, great size not too small, and still had the squeak. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  The very thin pizza is pretty good as we'll, nice and crispy but lacks sauce.  A fun sober Saturday night!"}
{"text":"The thing about Rossi's is I really wanted to like it, I really did. I've been there a half dozen times and that has solely been because they were the only venue of their kind in the area. As a lover of classic games I enjoyed going for that reason.  Their pizza tastes worse than the worst frozen pizza I've ever had (Roma's, if you are looking to do a taste test). The rest of their menu is just frozen food that needs to be deep fried. Decent enough, I suppose, but certainly not a selling point.   The most unfortunate thing about Rossi's, frankly, is the owner. If I was going on food alone it'd probably be 2 stars but on repeat visits my wife has been intimidated or indirectly berated for using a credit card to pay. She will no longer go with me when I visit for that reason. Seriously -- at the point that you are scaring away customers over a quarter in credit card processing fees you should consider either not taking cards, having a minimum, or charging the surcharge to the customer below a certain value. It's just basic customer service.  Frankly, the only thing Rossi's had going for it were the video game collection. While I am sure that they can build their own collection back up again -- why would I give my money to someone who browbeats customers in a poorly ventilated venue with bad food when I could just as easily go somewhere else that doesn't have those problems-- now that there is a somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well, HEY! I finally made it to the arcade... and they have- among other great titles- RAMPAGE, BURGERTIME, and TEMPEST. For real, a great variety of some of the best arcade games from the 80s and early 90s. I am in LOVE with this place, and I haven't even tried the pizza yet. The only game I would like to see is Xenophobe. And, maybe Time Warriors or Marble Madness... but hey- they have RAMPAGE! I AM the giant wolf-man. How I love eating people and smashing buildings to the ground!    I talked to the owner a bit about the arcade, and he is a very friendly guy. He also said: \"Don't forget to check out our weekly specials! We deliver.\" I will write an update soon; it turns out they deliver to my area. Yippee! But, I won't be able to beat my high score on Street Fighter 2 and Rampage from home, will I. Christie L.: I will BEAT your high score on Burgertime. Soon! Challenge! :D"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service please come here with patients with limited seating freshly baked pizzas and usually busy with kids of all ages. Recommend this to kids parents and all the above!"}
