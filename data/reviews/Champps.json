{"text":"Bad night here! I ordered the BBQ chopped salad. I asked for regular ranch on the side instead of the chipotle ranch. I got  my salad with ranch, chipotle ranch and BBQ sauce on the side. The salad was also missing the cheese and avacado! The best parts of the  salad in my opinion! The server brought them to me after I showed her they were missing. My friend had the ceaser salad. We were both unsatisfied with the cold hard piece of chicken on top of the salads. The roll was described as \"warm buttery garlic\" was more \"cold hard rock\"!  I will go again hopefully the kitchen can get it together!"}
{"text":"Menu offers a nice range of creative flavor combinations, fresh ingredients, always well-presented. Even though the place consistently draws a crowd, seating and service is quick and, like the food, consistently good. The sidewalk dining is especially when weather permits."}
{"text":"pass it by, the servers don't listen and the food is marginal, even for a \"Champs\" which normally pretty good. I only gave it one star because YELP doesn't allow no stars!!"}
{"text":"I actually really love this sports bar compared to the others. The food is amazing and the patroritas are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Champps is pretty good for a chain restaurant. I ordered the Kobe burger and the waitress allowed me to switch out the fries for a salad which was cool. The service is pretty solid I have to say. My friends and I enjoyed our meal. However, the prices are a little steep."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today and had a great experience. Sat outside, good service, nice food. Better than Applebee's."}
{"text":"As a foreign tourist you expect great things from chain restaurants such as McDonalds...(lol) we went for a quick bite and a cold beer , alas the manager lacks the knowledge or hability to distinguish a foreign ID from a USA one... so we ended up waiting for a couple of minutes and waited some more. . . And more, and the manager told me he did not speak spanol, that was quite ignorant of him, if you ask me ! He reciebed my USA ID and told me he didn't understand it because it was in spanish!!! Lulz... we only got to try some water ... the tap water is actually really cold and tastes like dirt so it's good For a MEXICAN !  So if you guys love your ALL AMERICAN FOOD WITH A SIDE OF RACISM AND IGNORANCE COME HERE AND ENJOY YOUR FOOD. . . tumbs down!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. I had the white flatbread pizza for lunch. Two hours later I became extremely sick and was for the next two days. Never again."}
{"text":"Ugggg. This place gets 2 stars because it was a good location for the event I went to -a basketball game watch party with other alums from my college. Otherwise, 1.

I ordered a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich, which is supposed to be one of their \"fan favorites.\" I expected a chicken sandwich with a healthy serving of (maybe even dripping with!) buffalo sauce, but what I got was a dry piece of chicken with a tiny bit of sauce, along with a pale tomato slice and lettuce on a bun. It tasted bland and made me wish I had gone for really anything else - it was a waste of my money.

I will say they had a good private room with a TV so that our watch party could cheer without disturbing other people. So, props for that.

Look...just try some other place. I would come back here for an event, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Horrible happy hour. Food is always okay. 

You think for a sports bar they would have a better happy hour, beer selection and cheaper food. Location is nice in Crocker Park with lots to do and close parking"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good, drink just right, service fast. Food great. Eye candy from the street excellent. Sushi pretty good . Will be going back when in the area. So should you."}
{"text":"Service was great. Atmosphere is more like a sports bar. I got the Kung Pao Chicken. It was awesome as usual but it's usually not very spicy, so ask for it extra spicy. My fianc√© liked her pasta dish."}
{"text":"Champps send this $10 gift on $25 purchase. It is only then that this sports bar comes on the radar. Every time after eating there we decide we ain't going back there until this $10 gift arrives. 
This review is for me to remember not to fall for this gimmick!! 
This time it was the smelly chicken asparagus and spinach pasta and the over fried and salty Kung pao chicken."}
{"text":"Oy vey... over-priced chain restaurant food is never a good thing. 

The beau and I were browsing around Crocker Park for a birthday gift this particular Saturday afternoon, and we were fending off our hearty desires to grab a delicious burger from the newly opened B Spot. See, we're *attempting* to eat healthy and didn't want to put ourselves in a calorie-rific situation of utter defeat.

And let's just be real here--we were looking for a little afternoon cocktail. 

So, quite defeated, we walked right past B Spot (wah!) and gave Champps a shot, hoping for some healthy options. The service was fine enough. Super nice waitresses and staff, you know, pretty standard for chains. We both ordered tuna sandwiches with side salads instead of fries, hoping for the best. What came out was what I believe is known as a level-10 fail. 

Holy effing mayonnaise. We're talking a 60/40 mayo to tuna ratio... gag me. It's not that it tasted horrible, but the look and consistency of this \"tuna salad\" was beyond nasty. It came out on four, open-faced-style triangles of whole wheat that were soggy with the wet, mayo/tuna mixture. To make matters worse, there were half melted pieces of swiss cheese on top of each. I ended up peeling off the cheese to cut the fat-grams, but I doubt it helped. The little salad had the signature \"I came from a big bag\" carrot and purple cabbage slivers. 

The drinks we ordered were super sweet and tasted little of liquor. I'm not one to bitch about cocktails not being strong enough, but this was borderline hilarious. And at about $10 a pop, you'd think it would have a little more booze. 

Anyways, we both left feeling pretty disappointed by this lunch and the bill came to a ridiculous $50+ total. For sub-par chain food and weak-sauce drinks? Booooo. I feel even dumber because I definitely know better than to pick a place like this.... Next time I'll just save my calories for a big, juicy burger from B Spot."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Monday. Had a burger and waffle fries. The burger was pretty good and the waffle fries were great! - crispy and season salty."}
{"text":"Visit to this place reminded me of  lyrics from Radiohead song - \"No alarms and no surprises\"...generous portions, attentive service, awesome location and great patio...
I didn't hate my calamari and when I asked my date about his cheeseburger, he said:
\"How many stars would I give? Well, 4 out of 5 for sure.But only because McDonalds' one gets 5 out of 5.\"
 And I agree that it my be a little bit overpriced but as long as shopping and dating central Crocker  Park will thrive, so will this place."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good. Solid bar food, nice waitress, roomy feel. We got the sampler platter which included mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, potato skins, and buffalo wings and everything was very good. However, I'll probably never come back here, seeing as my boyfriend and I were out visiting his family and this was the only thing open by the movie theatre the night of Thanksgiving. Don't be scared off by sports bar, because it's actually pretty tasty stuff here. :)"}
{"text":"I've been on a burger reviewing streak of late. Having not eaten red meat for about seven years for fear of mad cow disease, I now am looking at no retirement or improved standard of living and figure, wtf, let me die young. I would never eat at an establishment that is proud to have a misspelled name, but I also will never give that chrome domed quack Symon a dime. So Chammmmppppps it was.

I had a burger with bbq sauce and a teaspoon of cole slaw on it. Good crispy sear on the patty, but flavorless interior. Good bun, not soggy, nor dry. Waffle fries were of the chewy frozen section variety(which I like). Service was quick, price point was not outrageous for Crocker Park. Overall, way better than Roid Robin."}
{"text":"Great food for a chain restaurant! Love the calamari there.  It's always packed on weekends when I go there with my buddies to watch UFC fights.  Great service and a nice atmosphere."}
