{"text":"This place is nice and healthy if that's what you're going for. Quiet a few salad options and a side of daily puns for your enjoyment.   Salads are more or less around $10 mark. The salads are made fresh, so you'll usually have to wait around 10mins for your salad to be made.  The smoothies are ok. Healthy, but also slightly bland. Since this is a cafe, they have lots of tea and coffee options along with some pastries.   *UPDATE*  I honestly don't like to leave negative reviews, but I went from tolerating this place to hating it. Every time I go into this place, it's empty and it takes them so long to make a salad. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time during lunch, so I've started using the ritual app, which there should be no wait and no line. You get there, pick up your order and leave. Well that's not the case.  I not only showed up later than what ritual told me it would be ready (which is usually bang on) but I came later than the estimated time by ritual, and still had to wait another 10 mins for the salad to be made! To top it, I asked for no olives. Instead I got so so many olives in the salad. I understand, mistakes can happen, but when it's every single time I go there... that's just carelessness.  Sadly the customer service there is just poor poor poor. The food is simple and delicious but really overpriced.   Won't be back there since I have enough times and chances coming to this place."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! The girls here are very welcoming. And informative! The decor is adorable, rustic/ modern. It's very small and cozy, but with all the natural light you won't feel idly claustrophobic, they also ha e a few small table outside where you can sit and enjoy their treats!  I especially enjoyed their vicinity mango Popsicle, it was gluten free and vegan!   Their gluten free brownie was amazing! Very chewy and chocolate, moist and fresh! They said it was made of chickpea flower! Which I found very interesting!  My son got a cinnamon roll which he inhaled! (But would normally leave half) And we also ordered their freshly brewed iced tea, peach flavour, which Ofcourse was delicious!   Very good first  experience!   Will deff return when I'm in the area!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"3.6/5  pretty good...pretty happy. food tasted fresh.  the greek avacado salad was great but it was lacking in avacado and feta. the dressing and ingredients were all good though except i imagined bigger avacado and feta chunks considering it was a greek avacado salad afteralll...  it was almost like those ingredients were missing.  service was straightforward."}
{"text":"All future employees, be careful. The owner is kind at the beginning, but soon becomes an angry, moody and freaky person, who should look for professional help. The situation was so unbearable that all of us (employeees) had to quit."}
{"text":"I love this little place! The staff is super friendly, the coffee and snacks are delicious- all locally sourced from and the ambience is lovely. Great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"came here around a month ago and heard employees and the owner fighting. owner seems rude and creepy, he was screaming to one of the male employees and saying he was going to call the police. I was in the washroom thats connected to the kitchen and saw the whole thing. I asked some of the customers about the owner and business and one lady told me that the place is a mess, employees are always changing every week, and that the owner is a angry person. a few days later i saw a lady asking for sexual desire for money and weird enough i saw the same owner talking to her and getting into his car!!!!!! what a coincidence and i'm never coming back here again! something and someone needs to investigate this place and the owner asap"}
{"text":"We stopped into this cafe on our way to the distillery district. My Son had a watermelon slushie, I snuck a sip and omg it was tasty! It was made of actual Fresh watermelon, perfect for a hot day! I had an iced coffee, it was so refreshing, made with care! The place was clean and the food had vegan options which is amazing for us as we have food allergies. The staff were so friendly and helpful! I would absolutely recommend this cafe to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a fresh coffee or a snack (vegan options available) after strolling through The Distillery District."}
{"text":"No stars for you. I was always wondering why working staff is all the time different and the owner who probably doesn't know his age is so weird. Till now! My friend started to work there and it was the hell for him/her.  This guy is yelling at a personnel with no reasons. He is angry and rude. He is stalking his staff through the camera all the time. Since you stop to work there you will not see your money from the past. NEVER WORK FOR THIS GUY!  P.S.: Vegetable for salads is often not washed!"}
{"text":"This is my local spot to grab a coffee, and for a great price !   It is nice to support small businesses in the neighbourhood when we are becoming surrounded by Starbucks.  They offer regulars customers a punch card towards a free coffee, brilliant way to keep us coming. The wide variety a fresh baked goods is nice also ! Love the vegan breakfast cookies."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!!! The crew is amazing, super nice and always there to take suggestions. They make most of my days :) About the food: they have vegan and vegetarian options and most of the food they have is homemade, which nakes it even better!!! I'm in love with most of their things. Salads are good, bakery is good... All os good! They make the things with love, even if it's a coffee and you can really tell after you try it, it's not only delicious but makes u feel special for how it is made!!  Thank you so much for turning my bad days into good ones, and my good ones into awesomeee!!!"}
