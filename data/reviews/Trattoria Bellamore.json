{"text":"My favorite restaurant!  I went last Saturday with my husband, my daughter and her boyfriend.  The food is perfection, the staff are on top of their game and the chef is great!  I had the zucchini rills and seafood pasta, both amazing dishes.  My husband had gnocchi in blue cheese sauce, which was so good I will have to order it next time, and the braised beef shoulder which was fall off the bone tender and delicious.  My daughter and her bf are vegans, they had a minestrone soup and a beautiful dish of pasta with mushrooms. They had a beautiful lemon basil sorbet for dessert which I am still craving!  Daniel is an amazing waiter, very friendly and fun!  An intimate place, the ambiance is great, very relaxed but classy at the same time. I highly recommend this beautiful little gem!"}
{"text":"Trattoria Bellamore! A little piece of Italy in Laval. A cute little restaurant located far from the craziness of Downtown Laval. A refreshing change from all the trendy places we are always looking for. 
We were greeted by Daniel, who offered us excellent service from the minute we walked in. Even took the time to ask us our names. In my opinion, offering personalized service is worth every penny you spend there (compared to the crapy service you get at other high end places). Not to mention that the food is incredible. The veal just melts in your mouth. We highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner or dinner out with friends. You won't regret it."}
