{"text":"please update your hours. called within a reasonable delivery period more than once and was denied. still support you."}
{"text":"Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy, at best. Staff was really rude both times."}
{"text":"Ordered a lg pizza for pick up, 30-40 min wait. Went to pick up my pizza and I arrived to have no pizza at all. They told a driver must have taken by accident. The skinny, is it took an hour for a new pizza, and they offered me nothing"}
{"text":"I really loved the food and some of the employees. But WOW did that manager make a mistake speaking to me the way he did over a 1.5 hour delivered pizza ( I live 7 blocks) with unmelted cheese and wings with no sauce. \" heat up your pizza and I'll bring some sauce down in an hour \" not the response a customer ever wants to hear. It's a shame. All it would have take n was a new pizza and wings. $20 a week plus gone from them."}
{"text":"I was at a friends house and we decided to order a pizza.  The woman who answered my friends call was very rude (I know this because I was on speaker).  She claimed they didn't deliver to his address which was 1 mile away.  I live over 2 miles from the store and never had an issue with delivery.  The woman eventually hung up on my friend.  He called back and she got defensive.  She hung up on him once again.  Remember, the call was on speaker so I overheard both sides.  My friend was not rude, not disrespectful, just looking to order food.  I will never order from this place again.  Customer service is what owning a business is all about.  This woman should be fired.  You lost many customers because I've shared my experience with several others who've ordered from this establishment."}
{"text":"I have always loved Chubbys pizza. However, if you plan on ordering.... PICK IT UP!!!! last time I had our food delivered, they said 45 minutes 1.5 hours later & 2 starving kids we cancelled our order & ordered from somewhere else with no apology!!! If your to busy to deliver just say so! Will not order again!"}
{"text":"Them bums dont pay there federal state or local wage taxes. It is a shame that a driver was murdered and another shot doing a ghetto delivery. Fried mushrooms and shrimp basket great. Pizza not so great."}
{"text":"We just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we'd try them out. Their prices are great but, seriously, worst customer service I've ever seen. I walked in and the guy had to finish his cell phone game before helping me. I get home and realize we were given the wrong pizza. When I called to see if they had our correct one the guy tells me that's what we ordered. I assured him we didn't, I was there when my girlfriend called the order in. He just said \"sorry man\" and didn't offer any solutions. So we just picked off the garbage toppings that we didn't order and threw most of it away. It would've taken very little effort to fix it for us. All this after it took them an hour to make the thing. I'd go back if I were desperate but it's seriously amateur hour."}
{"text":"The food they have is very good. It's like a warm welcome when you come in the door. The customer service is a plus. It's a place to try."}
{"text":"Although the wings are not up to par....the pizza is by far my favorite.  I've been around the world and I love pizza...but nothing compares to Chubby's for me."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and we live around the corner. It came cold and the sauce tasted a year old from a plastic Rubbermaid container. The meatball sub was bitter and gamey. Never again. Ever."}
{"text":"Had luck with Chubbies first time, fairly quick delivery, better-than-average pizza,slightly overpriced for the quality. , the second time I ordered from Chubby s  I wanted to take a few pizzas to work with me for a night shift. I called with an hour of advance notice. When I got there they had only made one of the two pizzas that I ordered so they threw together the second one gave it to me undercooked and through a handful of cheese on top of the first one that they made that was over an hour old and ran it through the oven so there was new melted cheese over top of a burnt pizza. When I call to complain I was put on hold then promptly hung up on. I would recommend Chubbies if your regular pizza place in Brighton Heights is too busy or has a long wait, but from my experience it's a 50-50 shot whether you're going to get a decent pizza or not."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from Chubby's and I was happily surprised with this fantastic little local gem.  When it came one to order there was no menu online, played it safe with a pepperoni pizza.  While the pizza is greasy, dear god is it good!"}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for a neighborhood pizza place. We live about 1 1/2 miles from here and they won't deliver up Brighton Road, which is kind of an annoyance. The pizza is decent, and I like their sauce. The garlic bread and breadsticks aren't too shabby. The prices are certainly reasonable. Admittedly, I've never tried the subs. And most nights when you call they put you on hold right away because there is only one person answering the phone, and that person seems to be busy cooking as well. But the pizza is leaps and bounds better than Mandy's, which is downright terrible. Not a bad little local pizza spot overall."}
{"text":"I was tired of all my usual delivery haunts (can they be haunts if you're never physically there?) so I tried Chubby's. Unfortunately named, but they've got seriously low prices, and I was feeling broke, so why not? I got two whole hoagies for $9.50, plus a $1 fuel surcharge -- not bad.  Oh, the food? It's pretty good. Better, to me, than Bomonti or R&B (which lately has had a weird bitter flavor in their food... hmm); not as good as Mandy's. Still: CHEAP! Also, they delivered pretty quickly. I'll definitely keep them in my rotation."}
{"text":"soggy cold pizza...tastes like cardboard....total crap!  was staying with friends and they only live 3/4 mile and we got the food 3 hours later....bitter sauce, strange aftertaste....tasted like raw dough....total waste!"}
