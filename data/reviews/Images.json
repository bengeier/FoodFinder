{"text":"First time here and loved it i live downtown las vegas and came to Henderson for business and came across images for breakfast and it was delicious! The service was great all staff is friendly, the ambiance was very old style I loved it! If you're ordering breakfast make sure you try the biscuits and gravy they give you a perfect portion of everything. Prices are excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh.  Friendly staff and cheap meals.  This is our favorite place to dine in.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Not so fancy but 100% satisfied"}
{"text":"For the price of food 5+ stars! Delicious and light on the wallet, we ordered steak and eggs which also came with fries, and buscuits amd gravy.  So much food!! Tim was our server, very pleasant GREAT SERVICE! will be back!"}
{"text":"Good value 
Good food.
Always busy 
3 full dinners for $30 
Prime rib plate with fixings for just over $10"}
{"text":"Got to hand it to the corporate world. They shorten the hours of the restaurants and raise the prices of the food great move"}
{"text":"Peppermill company delivers great food and hearty meals! This location is located inside the Rainbow Casino located at downtown Henderson at Water Street. 

This place gives an idea of how it must have been during the old times when the workers of the dam would come hungry and they will deliver amazing tummy-filling food. That's how it resonates in my mind when I come here. 

The food is good and cheap. We come here on days off to enjoy cheap delicious breakfast and they have great selections for lunch and dinner as well. 

The downside of this place is the parking.  It's limited, but a part from that. This place is great! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Busy as usual this morning but they are changing their opening time to 11 am beginning tomorrow. Best value for breakfast here but can't wait to 11 am for breakfast."}
{"text":"Images is the restaurant inside the Rainbow Club and Casino, located in downtown Henderson on Water Street. This place is always poppin on the weekends so expect a wait to be seated. They have yummy food at extremely reasonable prices, so we often make the drive out here for breakfast or lunch.

I have tried many items and everything has been really good. My one disappointment was when I ordered the country skillet, it was more like a frittata and nothing like a skillet. It had like 10 eggs and was so dense I couldn't even eat it. They also put American cheese in it, which is a big no no because I HATE American cheese. Other than that, I always enjoy my food. Some favorites are the steak sandwich and the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy. This is some good stick to your ribs food and portions are hearty. I usually want to go home and take a nap after eating here."}
{"text":"Images is a great place for locals who want a quick, huge meal for cheap! Came for dinner on a Monday night, and there was no wait to be seated. New hours has the place close at 9PM, so we overheard the last call was 8:15PM. We ordered the prime ribs for $10.50 and $12.50 for regular and extra-thick cuts. The extra thick cut wasn't remarkably larger than the regular. Tuesday specials have prime rib and porterhouses for $10. The prime ribs were cooked medium-rare as requested and seasoned well. Prime ribs came with vegetables (corn on the cob), potatoes (crispy fries and baked potato), and soup or salad (recommend the soup!). Will return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last few weeks, reasonable, ample food, service is spotty, sometimes phenomenal but mostly average.  Today, Sunday, June 11, 2017, the service collapsed into a heap of confusion and regression.  (Didn't see a manager, either.)  

As a party of 2 , left to wait 15 minutes to be seated, then we were  assigned to the pit of despair to the left of the cash register.  A teeny tiny booth and absolutely no waitress to be seen!!! After another insulting 20 minute stint in the outpost of omelet hell, I got up and asked to be moved to the now empty....main part of the restaurant, still made to wait like a badly behaved child.  

Finally someone showed up!!! (Holy smokes, I never worked so hard to order a simple meal!!!!!!!)

This place is too inconsistent.( Good food but even that has slipped, serving cold fries, and 1/2 a jar of mayo on a sandwich) Too many disoriented, disgruntled, unorganized wait staff....who can't get their shit together.

Update 6/14/2017

We are done with this place, the same New Yawk Waitress who makes excuses, rushes people out, crossed the line, telling us they were closing early to clean, slaps the worst meal ever on our table...can't stand this woman and because of her, we will never return....AND THE QUALITY OF FOOD HAS SLIPPED!!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously AMAZING. I've eaten here every time I've visited Vegas and have never been disappointed. Some of the cheapest food you can find around the strip, and excellent quality. I would recommend the prime rib, and if you feel like splurging, get it thick-cut. It's under $15, comes with soup or salad, mixed veggies, and a side dish. The meat is fantastically flavourful and huge. If you're hungry and don't want to break the bank, I would definitely recommend it. Don't waste $50 on a small cut of steak on the strip- get it here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Henderson and I've been here at least 20 times. The food is cheap but delicious. The place feels more like a diner than a restaurant. The prime rib is my absolute favorite food here. It is tender, juicy, and always cooked just right. And for a large portion for about $10, you can't go wrong. I always recommend this place whenever anyone is looking for a cheap, but tasty option. The restaurant is located in the Rainbow casino in old Henderson, so the waiting area to be seated can be smokey, but the seating inside the restaurant is fine. The service has always been great too, so it is also a great place when you want to be in and out in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I gave this place a shot after realizing it was owned by Peppermill. And it really delivered! The staff here is surprisingly attentive, constantly walking around with coffee refills and checking in on everyone. Seems like there were many repeat customers, and the value is fantastic. The parking is a little bit tricky, but if the lot is full you'll more than likely find street parking on Water Street. Definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise!  This place is a great place for desent prices and really good food for a casino caf√©.  As one other reviewer posted \"kinda old school vegas\" ( forgive the over use of that phrase ) but it fits. Today's special  $9 Tbone and it looked good."}
{"text":"Outstanding value reminds me of old Vegas $1.99 breakfast has all the basics covered, well prepared, over easy eggs just right, hash browns crunchy on the outside but not dry inside, above average biscuits and gravy and sausage patties, fairly standard coffee but not bad. Very friendly and prompt service. If you have problem with cigarette smoke this is probably not the best since you will probably feel it from the casino but for me it's part of the charm even though I don't smoke."}
{"text":"Old school charm with tasty food and HUGE portions! I highly recommend the chicken fried steak. It's cooked nearly perfectly: juicy on the inside, super crispy on the outside with STELLAR gravy! Add mashed potatoes + gravy and you will not be disappointed. This is an absolute gem and I highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Was in Boulder city and the fellow who ran the pawn show said this was his favorite restaurant I. Henderson. Thought we would give it a try. Not disappointed, steak and eggs excellent. Lots of food at a very reasonable price. Food tasty and service prompt. Talking with a regular who told I there was almost always a wait. we had a 30 minute wait and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, I've had places I eat at go downhill, but never like the meal I just had here. If this had been my first time here, I would have given Images one star. I gave it three only because of all the past great meals here, and hopefully I'll move it back up to five stars in the future. Though to be fair it might be a while before I go back.

They were out of medium rare prime rib, which happens. I ordered fried chicken instead. I bit into the breast to find it ice cold. The sever brought me a new one, only to have it be ice cold in the middle to. They ended up just taking it off our check, I wasn't going to try a third time. How does fried chicken get ice cold twice in a row?

My wife ordered the Cajun chicken pasta, which is one of her favorites. The portion size was half what it normally is and was bland. My wife actually had to ask for extra Cajun seasoning. I got the taco salad, and it was just a pile of taco meat on lettuce with a giant side of stale tortilla chips. After having to send back two orders of fried chicken I wasn't going to send anything back again if it was edible, but I was tempted.

Before I even got in the car my stomach started hurting. Had to be the undercooked chicken. I had stomach cramps all night.

This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in terms of food, and it came from a place I love and had given five stars to! I hope this night was just a hiccup in the kitchen, but it might be a while before I can stomach going back here."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for a casino diner.  We had a tuna melt and an omelet and both were pretty good.  Also the prices were really affordable here. The one major drawback with this restaurant was the cigarette smoke.  It wasn't too bad, but you could definitely smell it.  Because of the prices and decent food, I will most likely stop by this place the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Five star food and cleanliness. One star customer service. Great place to a big family for a cheap good sized meal. Prices are great and food is always hot, fresh and consistent. As far as the customer service, well I guess you get what you pay for here. Most of the waitresses and front end staff are rude, rushed and seem to have better things to do. If you need something to accompany your meal don't bother, just eat it the way it is or wait and have your meal be cold by the time you get it.  Before they did renovations they had a bunch of TVs around showing images of nature and cool places. The kids love to go there and keeps them entertained while waiting for their food. They have cut down on these to only two sides of the restaurant. Bummer to the kids they can't always see them depending on where we sit. This was a big selling point for the kids. We have ordered many things off the menu some are hit and miss. Stay away from sandwiches with turkey. It is processed and tasteless. Gross! Steaks,prime rib, waffles and pancakes are always good! Kids love the strawberries, whipped cream waffles. Huge portions and always good!"}
{"text":"Business as usual, chicken fried steak n eggs w hash browns n toast( brown gravy please)..
Opted for the late breakfast today on this rainy day.. This cloudiness n Rain got us feeling all lazy out here in the valley today, after driving thru all that floodwater, lol.. Theresa looked out by providing the best service and stayed on point checking in w us several x's throughout the meal. The Cajun chx sandwich was also on the table, but NOT for long! No complaints, feel like walking this food off now!!! Here comes the work, making the drive after eating this food, lol! Giving me the \"itis\" It's cool to be back on water st. While passing thru the Ol Skool spot n seeing the crew at Images/Rainbow \"keeping it 100\"... Thanks for the good food& great service, good to see y'all again! I recommend anything that catches your eye on the menu if your nearby stop in and check for urself. I don't gamble but you can get ur fix on that here too if that's ur thing. Mmm out!"}
{"text":"Edit review; I would give them a five, but as of March 2018 the significantly shrunk the menu and the hours. First off they don't open until 11:00 am. Some of the items removed are: Casino special, Philly quesadilla, Ortega chili and cheese omelette. The prices have been increased slightly"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great deal. I also love the food and the atmosphere. My favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"This place is the local diner I never knew I needed in my life. Service is quick, and the servers are very attentive. It's like something straight out of a movie. Servers walking around with a pot of coffee, making small talk, asking about customer's kids, and grandkids. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. Food came fast, and hot. We each ordered the Breakfast \"Casino Special.\" 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon, and your choice of toast or biscuits and gravy. All for a whopping $1.99!!!!!!!!! They outdid themselves, and I'm pleased to have had the experience. I'll be back. They may get sick of me. But that's okay!"}
