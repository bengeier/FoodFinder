{"text":"Sashimi and caviar on the unlimited sushi menu was a nice surprise. There is a solid selection of sushi and a large kitchen menu as well with soups and tempura etc.  They have paper menus with pictures of the different sushi items as well to help identify the food when it arrives."}
{"text":"The caliber of restaurants is not as strong on Nun's Island as it is for the rest of the city, so it was good to finally see a AYCE sushi place here.  Been to the St Laurent location a few times and enjoyed the food, even if the service speed varies.  This location is a bit less crowded so service is fast and attentive.  The lunch menu is a great value and the hot dishes are generally pretty good.  The sushi is not the best ever but pretty good for an AYCE.  I'll probably go back once a week."}
{"text":"Every time I get out of this place it's like I'm going to explode. I've tried a lot of all you can eat sushis and this one is by far one of my favs. If you are a sushi lover,  this place will satisfy your inner cravings. They do not only offer sushis but a whole array of warm plates as well. Love it !"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to that place, I am not disappointed.  The food and services are amazing.  It's worth every dime.  Despite the numerous customers, the food were prepared in a professional and quick way.   The waiters are also nice and smiling.    However, the hostess is my main problem.  I waited 10-15 minutes before she finally decided that I was actually waiting to be seated !  I stood at the reception like an idiot while she just ignored me, even passed in front of me.  But when a white lady came, she was quick to serve her first and me second.  It was probably the last time that I went to that place !"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night! Have to say for an all you can eat place the food was very good. We have tried many \"buffet\" style sushi places and it is hard to find ones that serve good quality food. The service was also great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous times and we were always very pleased with the food and service. On January 6th, we decided to come here with some friends for lunch. Service was extremely quick. Nonetheless we found a hair on one the scallops we ordered...gross. Apart from that, food was very good, as always. I read a lot of other reviewers talking about the rude waiter. We had no problems with the waiters and waitresses except for one particular gentleman. To the younger Asian waiter with the ponytail, my friend and I heard you when you made the comment about how we spent \"3 f*** hours\" in the resto. Even as we were leaving you kept cussing and swearing IN FRONT of us, YOUR CLIENTS, because we apparently took too long to eat. You have absolutely no class and no respect and you shouldn't be working around people.  You absolutely disgust me.  You have lost a loyal client. Good job.  Keep up the good work you miserable jackass."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, we had to ask for soy sauce... It took 20 minutes to get our second round of orders and the sushi was cold the whole time. Overall for 55 $ for 2 ppl, go get good quality sushi from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Beware of the greedy, owners wife! She could not care less about your experience. After having told me that it was $26 like 3 times, she asked me if I would be out in about an hour because at that time their restaurant gets busy! Made me feel like a bum! Sushi selection was poor. Not sure if food tasted bad because of the interaction at the entrance or that it was just substandard."}
{"text":"Nous avons eu un merveilleux service et la nourriture fraiche belle ambiance belle place je recommande moi et mon copain pensons juste a y retourner depuis quon nest aller"}
{"text":"J'avais l'habitude de manger des sushis à volonté en centre ville. Mais j'ai déménagé à ville saint-Laurent... Il me fallait trouver un bon sushi à côté de la maison! J'ai donc trouvé sushi palace sur Internet et nous l'avons testé! Et bingo!!! On a un bon sushi à volonté à côté de la maison!!! Et ce n'est pas toujours facile de trouver un bon sushi à volonté! Le poisson est toujours frais et le service est bon! La Deco est sympa mais il faut penser à réserver le vendredi et le samedi soir car il arrive de faire une heure d'attente!  Ils ont également une sélection de viande qui change comme l'agneau aux noix de cajou!"}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for the first time... this place is better than Kanda hands down.  The all-you-can eat menu has lots of options, more to choose from on weekends. There are also lots of cooked options for those who won't eat sushi.  Food is tasty, fresh and well presented. They have sashimi, all sorts of maki and decent tempura.  Decor is nice, can accommodate large groups and service is good. We went on a Saturday night, it was pretty busy so I recommend making a reservation.  No need to stress over parking there is free parking in front of restaurant. Lunch menu has fewer options but is pretty cheap at $15. Week nights at $23, weekends at $26.  They even have prices for kids... not sure exactly how much but it's about half price.  All in all we'll be going back, we had a good night."}
{"text":"Dined last Sunday, walked in before 6PM, and the restaurant was already packed.  Although it was busy, the food and service was still wonderful.  I will be returning for my 4th or 5th visit."}
{"text":"Super belle ambiance. Celui situé sur l'île est vraiment plus belle et a un deco plus asiatique que les autres endroits. JE suis allé à plusieurs autres Sushi palace qui était vraiment bruyant. Seul celui la où LE monde mangeait calmement . Cest UN endroit idéal pour UN date ou un souper d'affaire. Côté gout, TOUT était super et ça valait la peine de venir la fin de semaine juste POUR essayer leur tête de saumons."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Clean. Everything served hot was very good. But sushi's were not good. Everything seemed to taste the same, very bland... If you are going to order mostly hot dishes (fried , general tap etc.) then go for it . If your going mainly for sushi look elsewhere"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy ! Where should I start from ? Nose hair on the plate, flies on the soya sauce or the rude waiter ?  Sushi- all we get in Montreal are 9/10 sushi places run by Chinese, FYI sushi is Japanese. There are still good Chinese run sushi places. This one is just a disgrace to sushi. Soggy rice, frozen tempura and waiter with rude demeanour. This place is a No Go.  Let alone be the quality , it's nothing personal but personal hygiene."}
{"text":"I give 5 star not because it's the best sushi there is but because it's the best a volonté sushi places in Montreal. Well that's my opinion. I was in many all you can eat  sushi places but this one is the one I come back to even if it's 30 min drive from my house."}
{"text":"Compared to other cheap sushis \"all you can eat\", this place is not really good. The place are nice, but the problem is the food  variety and quality. In Nuns Island we don't have more options, that for that I use to go sometimes. But i don't enjoy a lot Sushi Palace to be honest."}
{"text":"Super endroit pour les sushis à volonté! Nous adorons cet endroit oú le service est très bien et juste assez rapide. Cet emplacement est notre préféré, mais nous n'avons pas été déçu des autres restaurants du même nom non plus. À essayer!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Sushi was the best I've ever had!!!! Yummmmmmm!!!  Wish I lived in Canada... I would come here all the time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité-prix pour des sushis à volonté. Évidemment, ils sont loin de réinventer les sushis et la cuisine asiatique, mais pour le prix, c'est parfait. Point positif important: le menu à volonté contient également une variété importante de plats asiatiques de toutes sortes, ce qui est idéal pour ceux qui ne mangent pas de sushis. Ils font aussi la livraison dans le quartier avec un menu à la carte abordable d'aussi bon rapport qualité-prix. Si vous allez chercher votre commande au lieu de la faire livrer: 10% de rabais."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The service is efficient, fast, and the waiters are very polite. The food is great, although some sushis are not to my personal preference, most of them taste quite nice. The cuisine menu of this place is what attracts me the most, the stir-fried Chinese dishes and the lamb skewers are must-tries.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Je vais normalement a l'autre Sushi Palace situé a l'ile des soeurs.  J'ai été disons-le déçue du menu midi qui ne contient pas grand chose. Pour en rajouter, la qualité de mes plats m'ont également déçue. Une chance que les fameux dumplings étaient bons !   Le poulet dans les  nouilles udon ne goûtait rien... Le sashimi avait une texture de décongelé Les sushis étaient minces et le riz se défaisait.  Bref, j'ai connu mieux !"}
{"text":"Surprenant pour un sushi a volonté (22$ la portion) ! D'abord le décor est design, en bois et en lumières néon avec des palmiers, c'est récent et ça paraît. Très propre.   Tous les plats sont a volonté : sushis, sashimis, plats chauds (cuisinés) et desserts. Il y a une carte des vins très raisonnable : nous avons pris un petit vin blanc bien froid a 26$, pas de quoi nous ruiner, mais ça a super bien accompagné le souper.   Le service était bien aussi, rapide surtout, on nous a expliqué le principe et recommandé des plats. Les menus sont intéressants car ils comportent des photos des sushis et sashimis (de belles photos claires et appétissantes) pour nous aider a faire notre choix. Faire attention, certains morceaux ne sont disponibles que les vendredis/samedi/fériés.   Essayez le petit pain sucré en dessert, c'est super bon !!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi ... How can you go wrong? Great sushi at an amazing price. Staff are polite and place is always clean.  They have very fast service, you never have to wait too long for your order."}
{"text":"Disappointment. I rarely write reviews, but this time I had to. This place is not even Sushi, it was disgusting. We were a group of four people, we didn't know what to eat, most of the pieces were so bad.   One server was extremely rude while another was very nice and helpful.   We were glad that they missed some of our orders. Hand rolls were more like chewy gum, sashimi was horrible, the soup was ok, I had the hot and sour and that was the best thing, other than the Water.   I highly do not recommend this place, although I heard a lot of good things about it."}
{"text":"Great sushi place for big groups and small! I really enjoy all their cooked dishes from the kitchen as well. If you are a big group I would definitely recommend the small room near the entrance. It's cozy and fun :)"}
{"text":"Très beau resto comparé à celui de Boucherville,  Notre serveur a fait un travail impeccable,  pas trop rapide et ni trop lent, il apportait nos demande à un rythme parfait.  Le goût et la qualité des plats est surprenante, Bravo!"}
{"text":"After dining here many times for lunch, this was the first time that I have been here for dinner. The cost for dinner might be 40% higher but the choices are 200% higher. The selection is absolutely amazing. I have posted photos of the menus. I had no clue about the amount of selections available. More importantly, the quality of the food is top notch. Service is 5 star and the establishment is spotless.  I rarely give 5 star ratings but this one is well deserved."}
{"text":"The rolls were a bit of a letdown, too salty.  The sashimi was quite good though.  The asian dishes were the standouts, general Tao, Pad Thai Anything with shrimps.  Very busy and keep in mind they close at 9:30 so best to come early if you wanna eat a lot."}
{"text":"Some plates are a hit and some are a miss. However, the good plates are so tasty that it makes you quickly forget the average ones. When the food is great, it really is. The service is amazing. The food comes quickly, the table is cleaned often and the staff is friendly. For an all-you-can-eat restaurant, it's definitely a great place! It's the perfect place to try all sorts of Asian dishes at a moderate price."}
{"text":"Did not eat here. I arrived for a late lunch to learn that they were closed. The staff at the door was flippant and incredibly rude. I invested the time to tell the owner, he didn't seem to care. If that's how they treat their potential customers, I cannot trust them to put any care into the food they prepare."}
{"text":"Sushi Palace is a great AYCE sushi buffet. The service is quick and efficient and the selection is prefect.  I have noticed that sometimes they forget a dish or two, but since you're allowed to re-order as often as you'd like, it's not a problem.  The prices are fair, around the same as any other buffet. But they have this deal where if you go at 9pm on friday, saturday, or sunday, it's 20$. The kitchen closes at around 10:30 though. It pretty much becomes a guessing game at that point. How much you can and should order. You don't want to order too much because you will have to pay for the extra, and you don't want to order too little. Because the food is so good you'll want to taste everything.   The sushi and the food is fresh and nicely presented. I think it's a great place to have an abundance of sushi.   It does get pretty packed so if you're a big party (5 or more people), make a reservation. I've had no problem getting a table last minute so far. But each time we were only 2 people."}
{"text":"Only one thing to say: what a disappointment...the food is of very little quality. The photos will speak for themselves: gyoza with more deep fried dough than meat, sushis with too much rice vs the fish. The choice is obviously very large but the restaurant should prioritize quality vs quantity in that case."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Avoid eating there for dinner on weekends. There's always a lineup. Looking at about 45 min wait. If you're lucky enough to get a seat, their service is slow especially when they're packed.  Generally there's an all you can eat menu. Pay one price and get all you can eat sushi and other asian dishes. Be careful not to order too much, there is a penalty for wasted food.   Great food. Slow service."}
{"text":"All-You-Can-Eat! Is there an end to my gluttony.  We we're patrons twice and the latter visit was as good. The name of the restaurant, an eponym derived from royalty to which seems highflown and colonial. Anyway, the food is great. The caviar fried rice is most worthy. The sushis, makis and sashimis are true to such establishment, less refined in the presentation. But still very much enjoyable. The hot kitchen menu substitues adequately for those who do not eat raw fish.  I am always reluctant to order more than twice. People tend to be judgemental."}
{"text":"This is by far my family's favorite restaurant. It's close to my parents' place and it's just so damn good...and if you're hungry, you'll be more than satisfied here, as it's all-you-can-eat. Last time we went they even accommodated the two babies that we brought.  Their sashimi is ridiculously fresh and we can never get enough of it. I especially recommend getting a bunch of Y stuff (the menu code...I can't remember the name of it!), the general Tao chicken and the Szechuan shrimp.  Ok, this is a sushi place so I should talk about the sushi. I'm very bad at knowing what I'm eating when we're talking about sushi, but I can always tell apart the dragon eye, as it has a different crust. (Yes, order it too!) They have some pretty spicy rolls and my family and I like spicy food, so this one is quite a charm. I always forget the name so we have to kinda guess while looking over the menu.  It's all-you-can-eat, but beware of ordering more than you can eat, as you will be charged for wasted food...so, just order smaller quantities multiple times."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. Unlike some other all-you-can eat restos this one serves tuna and surf clam!! Yay! The selection of sashimi is satisfactory. 2. They have a ton of other items ranging in ethnicities. Ranges from kimchi and general tao chicken. Very diverse menu. 3. Decor is clean, dramatic and spacious  CONS: 1. The sushi quality factor was lacking. No wasabi on the nigiri, big chunky pieces of fish, pieces that looked like they were meant to be garnish but were actually for eating, etc.  2. No desserts offered on the menu.   OVERALL: -Not a culinary experience but you get a LOT of variety and the sushi is not bad. -Service was very friendly and organized unlike Yangs sushi."}
{"text":"Ok 3.5, order on paper, all-you-can eat..yum"}
{"text":"I go to Sushi Palace a few times a year with a friend and we know the tricks to getting the bang for your buck at all-you-can-eat. Push your water glass aside, and I can't speak for the quality of the soups or salads because those of for lightweights. Stick with the sushi and maki rolls--it's typically quite good and not too much rice. Fresh tasting and flavourful, and the Spring Maki is delish! Rolls with mango--the mango was not ripe. Hot dishes--peanut butter dumplings are a good bet, beef tataki, and wafu shrimp were all very good. Many hot dishes are VERY greasy. Don't bother.  He had a pleasant dinner, but the service was beyond slow. Partly a strategy so we don't over order, but we were also next to a large party of people and we were ignored. I'm still waiting for my ice cream...."}
{"text":"Been here many times, usually excellent service and good food but today was the worst.. Our beef sashimi was not fresh as my friend took a bite and spit it out, so I tried n it tasted just not right.. I took it up to my nose to smell it and it was definitely not fresh like meat left out of the fridge a bit too long.. Brought it to the attention of our waiter n he said that he would not smell it and let the kitchen know. Still waiting for an apology or acknowledgement from management but nada... Very disappointed .ps still waiting for my glass of water to be filled .. Just left n nobody acknowledge this gross error on their part , so disappointed"}
{"text":"Been there a few times already. The ambiance is nice. The place is clean and modern. Not the best AYCE sushis i've eaten so far but decent. But this time...the rice of sushis were too dry, tasteless. Waiter that served us was nice compared to last time. He had a bad attitude without any valid reason. I've been there only because my friends wanted too but I wont be coming back if I had to choose on my own."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst AYCE sushi restaurant in Montreal. Went on a Saturday night with the hopes of enjoying all the menu has to offer...big mistake! Apparently, the chefs decide what you will eat. We placed our orders with the waiter after carefully selecting what we would enjoy....unfortunately we were later told that our sheet had been tossed in the garbage because the chefs complained that they were not up for making the food items we selected. What?!?!?!? I thought that was the goal of a AYCE restaurant. The waiter told us that management allocated us a 10% discount because of this. Unbelievable. To add to all that the food that we did actually receive was gross. General Tao chicken was 4 retried pieces of chicken nuggets and the beef and lamb dishes were pure fat...not an ounce of meat. Terrible experience. Would not go back, nor would I recommend anyone go there."}
{"text":"We went there on a weekday lunch. Since I haven't had sushi in a while, I was excited to get my teeth into them, especially in an all-you-can-eat. The service is what put my review at 3 stars.  The good: Nice looking place. Can be full but had a few free tables. Menu variety. Seats comfortable. Food is good. Food is fresh. Presentation of plates is very well done. Received our order as we asked for it. Side dishes were just as good.  The bad: Service needs to be worked on. We had to wait a good five minutes for our hostess to assign us a table. We had to ask, and wait, for us to get a second sheet of paper. Plates were dropped to the corner of our table instead of center of it. Water refill are quite rare. When we went to pay, our waiter had to run over for us to pay, even when there was someone else behind the counter, too busy to talk to her friend (and ignoring us).  The verdict: Great place to eat sushi, and lots of it, but do not expect to be treated like royalty. Actually, do not expect much from the service team there."}
{"text":"Excellent service and everything was really really really good !!!! Fresh, tasty and finger lickin good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'll shorten this up.  The one in this location, Ville Saint-Laurent, is ... alright. 3/5 The one in Chinatown is slightly better, 3.5/5 The one in Nun's Island (Ile-Des-Soeurs) is the best. I would give that place 4/5.  Anyhow, the one in Ville Saint-Laurent is alright. Food is just meh compared to the other two locations.  If you can, try to go to the one in Nun's Island. There is also a parking lot so you won't have to pay for parking."}
{"text":"This is a great \"all-you-can-eat\" place! Although the service is sometimes lacking, the food is well worth it.  A full menu of sushi, Szechuan, and Thai food are included in the price!  Don't even consider Kanda!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Sushi Palace in Verdun recently and I was extremely satisfied. I am a huge fan of the Saint-Laurent location, but I think this one may even be better! The sushi was delicious and the fish tasted very fresh. The deep fried dishes were all very well fried; crispy and not too oily. The beef sashimi: awesome! The service was top-notch. The staff was all very friendly and polite. We never ran out of water. I will go back for more, even if its farther than the Saint-Laurent location."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this sushi place.. All I have to say is their sushi are quite good! We ordered a trio sushi plate (42 pieces) for about 40$. Delivery on Friday's is after 5:00PM and we got our after 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great sushi, service and great value for what you get. There is reduced pricing for children which is a big plus.  The decor is great and they offer a varied menu for an a you can eat place. I prefer this place over Kanda since the fish is very fresh and the portions are ample.   It gets really packed at lunch so head early. :-D"}
{"text":"Whenever I want to do \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi, I always come here!  The sushi always fresh and it is delicious! Not only do they serve sushi, they also serve a variety of asian dishes like \"pad thai, fried rice, orange chicken (general tao) and more! If you want to go when there's less people, you should definitely go during lunch time although there are more variety of sushi and dishes during dinner time!"}
{"text":"As an Asian, I don't like this restaurant since the foods are not pre prepare. Just not good."}
{"text":"Don't go there! Sushis are not even fresh + they're not even good. i've had better sushis, way better! Try Sushi Plus instead"}
{"text":"This is a decent sushi place options are very limited. I gave this place 3 stars because of the portions we ordered chicken wings as an appetizer and got 2 pieces of wing dings. However the sushi tastes decent and so does the tempura."}
{"text":"Great menu. Perfect portions, great service and ambiance. Good value for money. And delicious food."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner last evening for three of us.  Usually I'm a little jaded with the AYCE variety as the quality is usually a bit less.  What you see in lesser quality usually you eat more quantity!  On the weekends pricing was $26 for AYCE.  We started off with salad which was a nice fresh green salad.  I also ordered the kimchi to test to see if it was the real deal or a watered down version for Quebec palettes!  Another order of takoyaki to test to see if it was the real deal.  It wasn't bad but not much tako!  It was the watered down version ( a little dissappointed!) Then we ordered General Tao chicken (A Quebec staple!) which was nice and crispy!  Chicken Pad Thai (had a nice little spice to it!), Chicken fried rice (very good!), stir fried vegetables (not on the menu but asked as there wasn't much veg on the menu!) very nice flavour as well! Thai chicken curry (very nice flavour).  As well I ordered a bunch of sushi rolls (Dynamite, Salad rolls etc)  the rolls were quite nice.  The one with the soft shell crab didn't have as much flavour or crunch but was decent.  Also ordered a salmon sashimi and white tuna sashimi (came out with chopped green onions) for nice additional flavour.  The sashimi although cut in smaller pieces was surprisingly quite fresh and had excellent texture.  The service was excellent and we will definitely return.  Nice ambiance and feel to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This large AYCE place is sort of like Todai meets PF Chang's.   It is located in the Place Longueuil shopping mall on the South Shore off St. Laurent, not too far from the Pont Jacques-Cartier.   Todai is known in California for it's all you can eat sushi in mass quantities, buffet style. PF Chang's, that Scottsdale, AZ HQ'd Chinese chain, is known for its large faux statues. Sushi Palace combines these.   The place is very large, seating over 100 people, maybe up to 200 if you used every seat. The space has high ceilings and is airy, with large columns covered with ancient Chinese calligraphy, and above the sushi counter and kitchen, large Buddha statues on the upper half of the wall. These are not Japanese looking Buddhas, but skinnier Chinese looking ones. Nonetheless, they add to the PF Chang likeness of the massive horses they use in front of those faux Chinese eateries.   And speaking of faux, this is faux Japanese, as it is owned and staffed with Chinese. And although it is an AYCE place, it is not a buffet. You sit, get a waiter, order off little sushi or other item check lists, and they go order it for you from the cooks/chefs under the Buddhas.   They do have a large selection and variety of foods. They carry most common Nigiri sushi items (except Uni and other more exotics), and some sashimi as well. And they offer other popular Japanese dishes like Yakitori au Boeuf and Tempura aux Crevettes. Actually, they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections.   But if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese, try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L'agneau Mongolien. Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf, ou Udon.  They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude, \"Boulettes de Pieuvre\" ou Takoyaki! And being in Quebec, they offer Escargots Gratines. Oh, and if you want a little flavor of Korea, order the Kimchi! No Poutine, though!  The service was actually pretty friendly and efficient, and the food wasn't bad for an AYCE place. Dinner is $25.50, and you fill out your 2 tickets, and when you are ready, fill 2 more out till you're full.   If you feel like Asian food but want a variety and you are really hungry, this place is meant for you. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Bar none the absolute worst Asian food I have ever had coupled with bad service. I did not tip because I was dissatisfied with my service and experience and the fact that they do not take American Express. The server then argues with me and says I should tip him even though I am not satisfied. It is the worst etiquette to solicit a tip from a customer. I will never return to this place and I would highly recommend that no one else does either."}
{"text":"Sushi Palace 101:  1. Not all sushis are created equal, so choose carefully.  This place is not bad if you know what NOT to order.  2. !!! Stay away from any tartares!!!  These are used to push out the least fresh fish. On the verge of spoiled but the Mayo helps mask that tangy flavor :p  3. Sashimis. GOOOOD. HARDER to hide the freshness, don't be shy to order a ton of salmon sashimis and make your own tartare ;0  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."}
{"text":"Great place if you want lots of good quality sushi. For amazing prices. $22-25 per person for all you can eat.   Usually, before coming to Montreal, I'd avoid a sushi all you can eat at all costs. But then seeing what this city offers in terms of sushi (a couple of amazing but very expensive places, or terribly bad places), this place turned out to be simply amazing.   We now go here now, me and my gf, everytime we feel like going to town on sushi. And its really good sushi too. Obviously not the best, but for the price, really good. If you want something more fine, then go to Park. If you want two bottles of wine, as much as you want, and to leave happy without thinking you spent too much, this is your place.  (Important to note, the All-You-Can-Eat is also to order, it's not off of a buffet. You make as many orders as you want. But if you over order, you gotta pay $1 per piece, apparently, though I never have, and we've left up to five pieces.)"}
{"text":"I used to go there alot , the problem lately is the inconsistency in freshness and the quality of the food. In general its an ok for all you can eat. Weekend menu has better variety than the test of the week. What i dont like about the place is the service. They really don't take care of there customers, bunch of immature servers with obviously no manners especially if you want to place a reservation , dont expect to get better service if you meet the manager ( you will than know why they have bad service) . Last time we went we had a reservation for 10 people, 9 were there on time . The girl refused to sit us before he arrive . How insulting the way she was speaking to us. And that was the last time i will ever step in that place . I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good value for your money. So more choices that didnt have the chance TO Try everything on their menu. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Le midi = All you can eat sushis !"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great time. Great sushi and Asian fusion dishes varieties. We received some one of kind of services from a AYCE sushi place. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi all you can eat in town... fresh sashimi everyday.   I brought my kids here a lot, because they have the best chicken wings, and  tempura .."}
{"text":"J'habite IDS alors j'essaye d'aller dans les restaurants de l'Île lorsque qu'il est pratique. Suis allés avec des amis (4) et nous avons très appréciés. Le service est impeccable, les plats sont servis très rapidement sans que ce soit trop précipité. On nous a expliqué le fonctionnement, donc nous avons commencé par le chaud, ensuite les sushis pour terminer par le dessert.   Mes coups de cur sont: le poulet Général Tao à goûter absolument, les sushis de pétoncles épicés sublimes, pizza sushis et évidemment le petit pain sucre au dessert. Nous avons pris d'autres plats, tous excellents.   Et tout ça au prix du buffet..."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem.   From the get go, this place was amazing. Waiters are extremely friendly and efficient. Once we sat down, we decided on soup. Here is the shocker: before even asking the waiter, he knew what each of us wanted and had them for us before we even ordered!!!!!!   If telepathic waiters weren't enough for a 5-star review, let me tell you about the sushi: Hands down the best Sushi I've ever had, and for amazing value. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Toppings were extremely tasty. You can also order from the non-sushi menu. We ordered the shrimp tempura and boy oh boy, was it good!   The ambiance of the place is great. Service is extremely fast. I don't usually dish out 5 stars, but I would give this hidden gem 6 stars if I could! Make your way over there pronto."}
{"text":"Jai adoré mon experience au Sushi palace sur L'isle des soeurs a montreal. J'étais tres content de savoir quil y en avait un sur la rive nord, près de chez moi.   MAIS quand j'y suis allé, j'ai été extremement déçu par le service et la nourriture. Ça a prit 30 minutes pour que notre premiere commande soit envoyé. La serveuse etait un peu non chalante et notre table semblait salle. Les petits plats etait majoritairement fait de petit morceaux de boeuf tres pâle dans une sauce tres liquide. Le riz pour les sushi n'etait egalement pas tres bon. Apres une seul commande assez petite nous avons decider de partir. ( payer 30$ pour 3 plats chaud et une 15aine de sushi separer en 3, un SAMEDI SOIR) tres mediocre.   Le plus beau dans cette histoire cest que lorsque nous somme aller payer a la caisse. La personne en charge de faire payer a fait la remarque a l'un de nous que le pourboir netait pas assez gros. Jai alors ajouter que en effet, contraitement aux autres place nous n'avions pas dutout aimés. Il a seulement repondu \"ok\"...   plus jamais. Et je vais decourager tout mon entourage dy aller. Mediocre."}
{"text":"Comme sûrement plusieurs autres, j'ai découvert Sushi Palace grâce à des coupons moitié prix trouvés sur le Web. Ça n'est pas l'endroit le plus près de chez moi (2 lignes de métro et une marche de 15 minutes) mais on s'est dit que l'aubaine sur le repas valait le prix du transport.  Petite remarque pas rapport. En marchant vers Sushi Palace à partir de la station Côte-Vertu, j'ai trouvé une rue qui porte mon nom de famille. C'est la première fois que je voyais J'étais bien contente alors j'en ai pris une photo! Et oui, les simples plaisirs sont mes favoris.  Bon, de retour à Sushi Palace. Je savais que c'était un buffet donc je suis allée au gym en après-midi et on a fait par exprès pour manager plus tard que d'habitude. On a commandé un peu de tout pour ce qui est des sushis et du tempura. On a dû en reprendre deux autres fois car pour chaque commande, on doit remplir une petite feuille avec nos choix, et au départ, on n'était pas certain des proportions.  J'ai bien aimé les sushis et le tempura et je suis ressortie pleine à craquer. La chose que j'ai le moins aimé c'est que le resto sert aussi de la cuisine Thaï et du Séchwan. J'aime mon japonais traditionnel et je trouve ça bizarre que ça soit mélangé avec d'autres cuisines asiatiques qui, selon moi, sont complètement différentes. Si l'endroit s'appelait \"Palais d'Asie\", ça ferait plus de sens il me semble. Je comprends que c'est utile pour les groupes où il y a des gens difficiles, mais bon, j'ai droit à mon opinion.  Somme toute, j'ai quand même aimé mon souper et j'y ai fait le plein de sushis jusqu'à ne pas pouvoir manger mes derniers morceaux. Si j'habitais dans le coin, j'irais peut-être encore, mais vu la distance, ça ne deviendra pas un endroit où je retournerai souvent ."}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé ce resto bon, mais il n'y a pas de quoi se péter la tête? sur les murs. Le service est rapide, la nourriture est bonne, cependant, le choix de sushis (à volonté) est plutôt limité, particulièrement la semaine. Dans un autre ordre d'idées, je dois mentionner que j'ai rarement vu des toilettes aussi sales...  C'était un mercredi soir, il y avait peu de monde au resto, et pourtant, les toilettes étaient carrément dégueulasses. Je n'ose imaginer ce que ça doit être un samedi soir... J'espère que la cuisine est plus propre.."}
{"text":"Un restaurant à sushi vraiment très très bon. Le service est toujours rapide et irréprochable, la qualité du poisson est top. La carte est fournie et propose également divers plats et mets asiatique de choix. Le prix est fidèle à un sushi all you can eat. Je recommande fortement!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am really not a fan of this place, never going to come back because the sushi doesn't taste fresh at all. What I ordered  had this off taste and I was forced to pay for what I didn't eat. Service was good and our waiter did his job well, it's not his fault the food was not that good."}
