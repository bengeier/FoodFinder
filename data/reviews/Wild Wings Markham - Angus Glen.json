{"text":"We came in on a Saturday night ~11pm. This place was pretty quiet with only 3 tables occupied. We were very surprised the fact that the whole place is playing CP24 when there was hockey playoff game going on. When we requested to switch the channel, the server changed it politely but we could tell she wasn't very experienced from her lack of knowledge of available sports channels. But this place is new, we understand that.

Another thing about this place is the lights were so bright... that it just feels very alert and not that kind of atmosphere you'd expect from a bar. Hopefully, the management would know it soon enough or else, it just doesn't feel as chill or relax at that bar.

The food was up to par - we ordered potato skins and a pound of wings. They came pretty fast, unlike the reviews below say, possibly due to not much people were in the restaurant.

When we wrapped the bill, the server gave us exactly $5 bill with no coins left for us to give tips. I mean, if you expect me to pay $5 tips you still should give me worth of $5 coins to leave me as a customer that flexibility to decide on what to give for your service. That is hospitality 101.

Another point to note is that, my group of friends always come here on Friday night ~1230am after their games, this place was kind enough to keep the bar open just for them on a weekly basis. Props to their genuine service but some other basic bar service stuffs just need a touch up.

Overall, a new place needs time to gain that experience and I look forward to coming back after they improve."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but new workers and poor management. The food is garbage. I got a beer here and they didn't even poor it properly, 1/4 of the glass had foam. Management sucks and not enough people to serve customers."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night at 11pm and the first thing I saw are 2-3 tables piled high with eaten wings, empty bottles, and all types of used utensils. No server in sight. When we indicated that we wanted a particular table, the bartender came out and cleaned it for us, indicating how busy they are. The place was barely half full so...sure? I guess. 

Don't get me wrong, the service was very polite, but when you've been sitting for at least 30 minutes, staring at tables full of greasy dishes and small mountains of chicken bones, you question the operational efficiency and overall hygiene of the restaurant. Eventually, they did clean it up but it wasn't until halfway through our visit. 

The food was your typical bar food. We came here for one reason, and one reason only. GAR PAR FRIES (or gar par poutine is what it's called in the menu, but there's no gravy or cheese curds so don't be fooled). It was really simple stuff, just fries smothered in white garlic sauce and sprinkled with parmesan. Others got wings, which I heard were alright. 

However, never ever order the garden salad as a side for anything. Ever. It is the worst salad I have ever come across. It was DROWNED in some sort of weird brown vinaigrette (maybe, can't tell), and piled with cheese. The sauce made the crunchy bits soggy and the cheese became a brown mush. In a quest to have something healthy along with the wings and fries, the sad salad remained barely touched in a corner of the plate. 

Overall, very meh. There are much better options out there for bar food. If you're in the area, it'll do, but if there's something closer, don't hesitate to go to that instead. The hunt for good gar par fries in the area continues.

{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best wings joint I have ever been to. I probably come here multiple times a year. They have multiple locations across North America and over 70 flavours of wings. It never gets boring with you can try that many different flavours. My favourite flavour is the sweet escape. This is honey garlic and gar-par (garlic and Parmesan). I can never get sick of this flavour. You can choose from dry to saucy wings. Portion wise, for each single portion it is about a pound (10 wings ) which is a decent portion per person. They also come with a side of carrots and celery!"}
{"text":"The poutine tastes good but I would only eat it there and not grab it to go. Before they used to pack it in a Styrofoam container but now they give it in a small cardboard box so by the time you get home it's all soggy and stuck together. Also, the cheese is only distributed at the top so your bottom fries don't have enough."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday night and it was completely empty. One table.

Server said we could sit at a booth and did just that. Then the server came back and said because of the raptors playoff game, booths were reserved for 4 or more people and told us we can sit at the bar.

Didn't realize empty restaurants with no customers can pick and choose their business based on anticipated crowds. Too bad. We would have spent quite a bit on beers and food since we are huge raptors fans.

I write this as I sit at a booth at the wild wing on markham road. 

Won't be coming back to the Angus Glen location ever."}
{"text":"This is a brand new place. We were excited to try it out because it's close to our house. Once I arrived to the parking lot I could see my friend inside from far away which I though this place should be little darker or even have the glass tinted. 
The waitress was nice but wasn't really experience. 
The nacho was so disappointed. Hardly any cheese on top and the pepper, olives with lettuce on top was put on by itself. The dry wing was like Shake and bake. The Poutine had too much gravy and stick to the bottom. 
Most disappointed place was the washroom. It's for one person and small. 
The owner came to say hi to us and ask how's the food . We didn't have a heart to tell him. I think he should realize our first impression should be A's the first time. Not like this."}
{"text":"Service was deadly slow. There were 2 waitresses at first on a Saturday night and then a 3rd one started later on. The girls were working very hard so its not their fault. They are just under staffed or too cheap to hire more people.

Food was alright.
Gar par onion rings $6.99 - a hard crunchy outer shell. They were a bit on the cold side so it must have been sitting there in the back before it was served to us. I guess this had to do with the slow service.

1lb sour cream and onion flavoured wings (dry rub) $10.99 -  the wings were served fresh as they were nice and hot. First time trying sour cream and onion as a flavour for wings. I liked it and would order again.

TV's all around. The booth seats are really uncomfortable because the table itself was like 2 feet away so had to hunch over just to eat."}
{"text":"This was the worst wings experience of my life. I was not served for over 20 minutes, was then asked multiple times whether I wanted breaded or unbreaded wings (I chose unbreaded btw). Wings took over 30 minutes to come, only to be cold and breaded. The fries were stale, so much that my fork couldn't even pierce it. And when I asked about the error in my order, the server simply said he can redo it but I'll have to wait for everything to be completed before they can make mines. I accepted whatever I had as is because I was not down to wait another hour for 8 cold wings. I was not satisfied, the flavour was disgusting and I had to grab food elsewhere after."}
{"text":"This is a new Wild Wilds at the corner of Major Mac and Kennedy. It is in the same plaza as Symposium. The place was really new and really slow. They seem to be short staff and the kitchen food takes forever to finish. Probably won't go back any time soon unless I was desperate. Also, the fries, gravy and cheese taste bitter. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad wings. Save yourself the money and drive 5 mins east to the Markham/bur oak one, at least that one won't give you diarrhea!"}
{"text":"The wings were great. Crunchy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. The sauce was nothing extraordinary, but tasted pretty good on the wings. Sadly, the poutine fell way below expectation. The gravy was bland and the cheese was cheap grated cheese from the supermarket. 

The service could have been much better. We had to ask the server to bring the plates, then again to bring the utensils. On the other hand, there were lots of big screen TVs all around the restaurant. This would be a good place to watch a sports game if the service was kicked up a notch.

Final thoughts - Would come back from the wings, but that's about it. Maybe take out next time?"}
{"text":"I've been to a few restaurants in my day and this one really takes the cake. I'd give it 0 stars if possible. 

We came in on a Monday night and ordered some beers and wings. Didn't think this would be too hard of an order but alas we were mistaken. 

Half of the wings came after 45 minutes and were cold. The other half came 15 minutes later and were rock hard, inedible. 

We asked to speak to a manager since we really just wanted our thoughts to be heard. Another 15 minutes later another server came over saying they're kind of the manager?? He said the food was not cold and it was not slow and there's nothing he can do. Appalled, we asked him to call the owner who is clearly the root of the terrible service this location seems to be known for. He offered us a dessert. We said we would pay half the bill. Eventually he gave in. We work five minutes away and will never return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for half priced wing night. It was fairly empty at about 7.30pm which was surprising. There were about 3-4 servers walking around but after about 5 minutes, still no one came to take our order. Finally we called someone over and he took our order. We wanted 3 pounds between 2 people but we're notified that the Deal was only 1 pound for 1 person. And you had to order a drink with it. And if we wanted an extra pound, we'd have to order an extra drink too. So it roughly comes up to $10-12 per pound + side of fries or a salad + a drink. 
The food was average at best and it was about 7-8 small-average wings per pound. Nothing special at all.
At the end, we called for the bill 3 times before it arrived. 
Go to St. Louis for wing deals on Tuesdays down the street. It's more worth it.
