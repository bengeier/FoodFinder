{"text":"Did you try to drink dinner again...? For shame, at least subs n more a family run establishment has your back. Open to 5 am Friday and Saturday nights, they offer a serviceable donair and sub option for those of you who tried to dance the night away but forgot to pack a snack into that tiny clutch purse.   It also has a sizable seating as well, so your not left out in the cold trying to chow down and recharge those batteries.   I must say I'm also impressed with the cleanliness of this late night establishment which to me defies logic. Although I've never been into the bathroom past 12am which might change my opinion. Maybe someone braver than I could report back.   Keep that robot dance alive people!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst sub I have ever had. I have recently moved to Calgary and stumbled across this establishment hoping to enjoy a tasty lunch after exploring the city. What I got was the most disappointing food I've had in recent memory.  I asked the counter person how the meatball sub was? He responded: \"It's amazing!\" It was the furthest thing from amazing - it was stale, tasteless and unappetizing. I barely ate 1/4 of it before throwing it out.  My friend's Donair was just as bad. Too bad, because the establishment is clean and well maintained. Anyway, avoid at all costs  - even if you're stumbling by after last call.   Hopefully, they put forth a more conscientious effort in the future towards a quality product."}
{"text":"Despicable! I wouldn't let my dog eat that trash.   Steer clear unless you enjoy paying almost ten bucks for microwaved cardboard. Sure it's clean - how could it not be when there's not a morsel of real, legitimate food there. They should be ashamed of the ashes they try to pass off as sandwiches.  Disgusting. It's a shame that subway and mr sub wins again. Step up your game, mom-n'-pop shops!"}
