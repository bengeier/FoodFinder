{"text":"First time visit, got the steak bowl, and pork burrito it was good. I loved the different sauces they offer. Will be back again.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at hot heads. The steak had a disgusting sweet taste to it and the chicken in my burrito bowl was cold. When i needed to get more sour cream the staff had disappeared and I was not able to summon them from the kitchen. Terrible."}
{"text":"Nothing special about it. The rice tasted old. I might try it again. But its nothing to compare with cafe rio ."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. The rice was not cooked. I prefer to go to cafe rio or robertos taco if i want to eat mexican food."}
{"text":"If Chipotle and Hardee's had an illegitimate child it would be this Hot Head Burrito location. It was our first time at a Hot Head and we were amazed by the lack of any food preparation going on. They were out of veggies and and lettuce. The wait took 20 minutes and there was only 2 people in front of us. Admittedly the portions were large but when the quality is bad it doesn't help. All in all I wasted 20 minutes and $20 on 2 below average burritos."}
{"text":"Gross and over priced. 

We were really looking forward to this place opening up because it is right around the corner from us. What a let down.

We went soon after they opened and we were excited when we got home. We were soon incredibly disappointed with the portions, taste and temperature. 

1) Everything was ICE COLD. Not slightly less warm from travel more like never was warm. 

2) Very weird proportion of toppings to meat. Huge scoops of salsa on top of a tiny pile meat.

3) Nothing at all was seasoned. the guac was a pale green paste. For a place called hot head, nothing had heat or flavor. 

I don't mind paying some good money for an in and out Mexican place but it is hard to justify their prices."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service is really inconsistent. I like the workers, just not the manager who I think might be the owner too. I came on my birthday because I got a email saying I get a free item I can't remember what it was and I told the cashier she checked my hot head card and it did indeed say I get a free item. She accidentally did something on the pos and she lost it she said she would honor it but needed to get her manager to override it. I thought cool no big deal. The manager came over. Didn't acknowledge me he then accused cashier and me of basically lying saying to her \"Are you sure? People been lying about this\". I wanted to throat punch him so bad. If it was so bad I would have gladly shown my ID with my birthday. This happened in June and I thought well I'll give him a chance maybe he's just had a bad day. Well I go in today and I was told I can't get 1 of each salsa for my 2 pack anymore I guess the manager told them not to do it anymore. I just don't like the inconsistency."}
{"text":"Not very good just a freebirds and Chipotle knock off, only two salsa selections that was just a hot sauce bottle mixed with tomato sauce. They did have other sauces to put on the burritos but they didn't sound appealing."}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic! The subway of burritos I've never been a fan of chipotle so this was finally a really nice burrito, bowl and nacho (and so much more) place to find. Wish we had one in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I visited Hot Heads for the first time today in Cornelius, NC.  There were 3 employees and 1 owner/operator. Everyone was very confused with our whole ordering process.  A few of us had come from our office rather than bringing an order for the whole office to try it out.  We were very disappointed that the amount of chips given was so small... literally like 12 chips in a little bag.   I had asked about getting a large Queso but then they said it didn't come with more chips, so I decided to get the small.  But they rang me for the large by mistake.  So then rather than fixing it - the owner gave me the large.  I said I would take the large but would need more chips, but he said \"Chips are totally unrelated to the Queso\".  So I said \"but what do people do with the queso if they don't have chips with it\" and he said people pour it on stuff.  He was VERY rude.  I frequent Salsaritas, Moes and Qdoba regularly but will not be visiting Hot Heads again."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere.  Staff is super helpful and always nice.  Spicy chicken is the way to go."}
{"text":"Place is similar to Chipotle/Qdoba.  Stand in line walk through and build a burrito, bowl, etc.

They even have a smaller burrito and smaller bowl.  I thought both small versions were still pleanty of food.

There are various other similarities different salsas and toppings including two different cheeses and lettuce.  Now here is where things start to get different.  They have MORE meats.  There are spicy versions of the chicken and steak and the have a BBQ pulled pork (i really like it).

Now here is the kicker.  They have maybe ten different \"sauces\" that you can finish off your meal with.  My favorite is the house hot head sauce.  Its garlicy sweet salty and has a slight kick.  Id put this stuff on my cereal if I could figure out how to make it.  

The only thing i dont like is that it seems like the food doesnt stay hot long.  Not sure if its a packaging issue or how they build the burritos or what.  I can get a burrito from robertos or don tortaco for breakfast and still burn my mouth at lunch.  Well maybe one more thing sometimes the staff don't do a good job of rolling the burritos so they kinda explode all over you but that's why I get bowls."}
{"text":"5 star for freshness and taste. I like that you are able to spice up your meat how you choose or just leave it as is. All of the veggies are extremely flavorful and the rice was cooked to perfection. Very polite and accommodating staff. Visited three times prior to leaving this review and would recommend over competitors."}
{"text":"Very good Barbacoa burrito, felt like I was eating healthy. I enjoyed my food not sure why everyone is writing bad reviews. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and huge portions. Great location with plenty of parking and easy access. I had the chicken burrito with hothead sauce and wild sauce, get a drink because it is spicy."}
{"text":"How do you foul something that can be so delicious and easily executed. I wish there was more to tell."}
{"text":"The sauce selection is fun - and liked that you can add marinade to the meat as well, but the sauces sink to the bottom of the burrito, so your last few bites are bursting with flavor, but the rest of the burrito experience misses out. 
The guacamole is not good - no flavor at all. 
I liked the chips, thin and crispy, but they weren't enough to redeem the guac."}
{"text":"This establishment serves perhaps the worst burrito in the area. 8$ for a cold steak burrito that fell apart before the first bite was taken. Would not recommend to anyone who enjoys decent food. On the other hand, If McDonalds appeals to your taste buds i would most definitely suggest hot heads."}
{"text":"Was in town and am a Mexican food fanatic, so I decided to try this place out.  After first walking in, the store was super clean and the staff extremely friendly.  It's actually under new ownership and the new owners were really nice and helpful (not to mention good looking!).  The ingredients were ridiculously fresh and the hot head sauce was so yummy!! I will definitely be back to try out the other sauces and I will even say it's better than chipotle!"}
{"text":"Well it seems we came at the wrong time of day. I was obviously helped by the unhappy franchise owner who didn't want to be there. No explanation of sauces which I thought was this whole concept. Competing with Chipotle  it was ok. $28 later for 2 burritos and 1 quesidilla and 2 drinks with 2 kids drinks it's a bit overpriced. Ohhh and btw you have to ask for a plastic fork Hope you do well but my family and I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I've never dined in Hot Heads, but I have gotten take-out a few times and it has been tasty every time. Similar to chipotle and qdoba, their spin is that they have a variety of sauces you can choose to put on your meal, which are quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch sometimes and every time i go its awesome. Its bascially got everything i want in lunch in gerneral. The proteins, carbs, hot sauces and i would definitely have a tortilla on the side. The people who work there are very nice and have good deals and discoints from time to time.

I usually go for the steak. You can make it a spicy steak if you wanted to and also go for the straight habanero sauce. And if im feeling up for it put some veggies in there. What i rrally like about the place is that its very clean and you can see them cooking too. Their chips con queso is amazing. Just writing this is making my mouth water. I actually do prefer this place over chipotle. I wish there were more locations cuz its far from my home at the same time i like how its kind of out of the mainstream stuffs. It makes the place more special. Go for it, try it out and i feel like it wont disappoint."}
{"text":"My best friend and I go here often. Fresh ingredients and an always positive staff. Much preferred over Chipotle or Zaba's."}
{"text":"Really good food. I recommend the steak burrito with everything. I had habanero sauce added to it and it is great!!!! We also sampled the tacos with taco meat and also with pork. Really sweet and great. I really recommend going here. Great service and great food. I would add more stars if I could. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Why do I prefer Hhb over the others? choices I can't get jalapenos or onions or the variety of sauces I can here. My kids prefer it cause its not as spicy as chipolte. I do however prefer chipoltes rice.  Staff is very friendly, needs online ordering."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here to try.  We loved it.  Great service and clean facility.  The best thing I like besides the overall taste is I have a problem making decisions at new restaurants.  I asked the employee what he likes and instead of just telling me chicken or something basic, he described his favorite burrito right down to the beans and the amazing habanero sauce.  I asked him to make me that and it is one of the best burritos I have had.  Great Job Hot Head and staff."}
{"text":"This location is CLOSED now.. 
All signage has been removed. 
Suggest you try Carboritos in Davidson on hwy 115"}
{"text":"Alright, so a few months later i'm gonna update my review. Well let me begin by saying i'm still in love with this place, my boyfriend and i come here at least 3 times a week. I'm honestly pretty shocked they don't know me by name, but i think they recognize us when we walk in lol. I get the same thing every time, i ventured out and got the chicken but i wasn't a fan, so ill stick with my spicy steak. The restaurant it's self is very very clean, the food is absolutely amazing and you get really big portions for what you pay. The steak (Which i will now stick with forever) NEVER has any fat in it. At all! Which if you think about other restaurants like this (You know who i'm talking about) it's almost always fat. Don't even get me started on the queso or pico and corn, oh my god. i love this place! The only drawback really is the fact they got rid of their lemonade :( it was so good! If you're debating on going i HIGHLY recommend it. Ill see ya sometime this week hot heads!"}
{"text":"Very good alternative to Chipotle/Qdoba. Quality of food is good, delicious taste, decent portion size and competitive prices.

I had a quesadilla, a nice touch to prepare it like a burrito and then grill it. 

Will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  there is no competition for this place as far as I'm concerned.  The meat is so fresh, everything was made to order, and the guy behind counter was something else!  Hothead Burritos has personality & so does the staff! 

Thanks A-lot... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My burrito looks like a baked potato The veggies that were $1.00 extra were dry in pans. Disappointed"}
{"text":"When this location first opened, the food was good, the portions were fair and the staff was friendly.  The last two times I visited this location were very disappointing.  Today's experience warrants a review.  They were out of the traditional flour tortillas.  The chicken for the quesadillas had been sitting for awhile and was dry.  One of the two sour cream containers, which I had to ask for twice, was not sealed correctly and broke open in the bag covering everything with sour cream.  The employee responsible for this was more interested in the gum she was chewing, than getting my order right and the supervisor (?) on duty was more interested in his cell phone and his own food, rather than his customer's experience.  Lazy employees and poor food results, no wonder the place was empty during traditional dinner hours.  Never going back."}
{"text":"It has the same concept as Chipotle but I feel the portions are bigger. But what does it is the sauces. They have the standards like chipotle but there are around 8 more ranging from mild to Very Hot. Also, the attitude of the workers is very friendly. It was a very pleasant experience and the food was great. Will be returning"}
{"text":"My husband and I both loved it! It's only my first time, but I liked it even more than chipotle. The steak was perfectly cooked, not fatty, and full of flavor. We both love the sauce choices. Really really good and we will be back! It's a must try for burrito lovers."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have. Tried to give this business many chances but I always get letdown with the dryness of the steak and blandness of their seasoning not to mention I saw an employee with her hair all loose and swinging around. Unsanitary."}
{"text":"Food was great, I especially like the chicken which I found quite delicious when paired with their \"hot head\" sauce.  Not sure where the few negative reviews are coming from as I found the food at Hot Head Burritos to be a lot better than that at Chipotle (and I have been a big Chipotle fan for many years.  Service was good but it is clear they are new and still working some of the kinks out.  I will definitly be back and look forward to trying all of the various sauces they have available."}
{"text":"Great, Just what we needed in this part of Southern Highlands - another burrito place. We checked them out to see how they compared to the cookie cutter Del Taco and the more authentic, albeit greasier, Don Tortaco. 

We didn't care for it. A family of four, we all ordered burritos and they were sort of season-less muck. I am a vegetarian and their offering was confusing with huge chunks of squash - which if they had been anywhere near hot - might not have been so bad. 

While it is understandable that the store is a relatively new addition to the strip mall and the crew are just getting the hang of things - it doesn't leave us with a enough faith to try them again.

Unimpressive."}
{"text":"I've seen this place around town for a few months and finally decided to give it a try. I went in for dinner on a Saturday night and it was empty except for one couple in front of me. The server was not overly friendly but was not rude either. He seemed like the manager and just tired from a long day I suppose. I ordered a steak burrito and steak nachos. It was similar to Chipotle as far as the assembly line process but the meat and chips did not look as tasty. They have so many sauces so I stuck with the sweet habanero. They also gave me some side sauces. Both items tasted great. A nice fresh taste to everything. Portion size was decent but not gigantic. No real complaints. Bottom line. The food was very good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First of all I was a little disappointed in the what I'm assuming was the manager... He was helping an older gentleman in line ahead of me and it was obvious he had never been to one of the other locations let alone this new one and it was apparent on the managers face he was trying his patience. Mind you at the time there were only three others in line. And as someone else who had never been to a hot head this was definitely not the business practice I wanted to see
Second once I began my order I noted the steak looked really dry and was then told that's because it was made in the morning. This seemed to be the only thing the young man behind the counter heard from our conversation as every next step down the line I continually had to repeat myself with the order.  From the looks of it they keep a cart of pre made back up behind the counter as opposed to making fresher items as the demand increases. This became more apparent when I actually got in to eating my burrito. Although the chicken had a good flavor it was incredibly dry. With that said I ordered a barbacoa burrito and a chicken burrito both had a good flavor when you could find the minimal amount of meat that had been scooped in. My chicken burrito became fully rice and beans before the half way point. 
Im hoping this isn't the case for all locations or that these are just some kinks that need to be worked out. We will give it some time then possibly try again. Until then it's tried and true chipotle."}
{"text":"Delicious! I think it's better than Chipotle. My husband is from Cincinnati so when we found out there was a Hot Head in Vegas we had to stop and I'm sure we will stop here every time we visit Vegas. Also, the staff is excellent and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Thank goodness!  Finally a burrito place in Cornelius!  I'm so sick of the inconsistent food at other burrito places.  Hot Head does it right - this is the 4th time I have been here and decided to leave a review.  This is a franchise, but met the local owner today.  She was great as was the rest of the staff and more importantly, my food!  Not sure what the other negative reviews are all about.  I noticed some of those guys even trashed Rusty Rudder and 131 Main - these guys apparently don't get out much.  Bottom line - Hot Head gets 5 stars!  Especially love the fact they have so many sauces and do a great job of explaining them all.  I spoke with the manager about their food and the fact that it tasted so fresh - she said that they don't have freezers and all of their meat is antibiotic free.  Hint - Clipper has coupons - I got a buy one get one - great deal!"}
{"text":"Delicious, always clean and ptofessional. Since this place opened in the Target shopping center....we've never been back to Chipolte!!!! Fresh and delicious food.....Give it a try"}
{"text":"No wonder it's empty at peak lunch time.  Pathetic worker. Critical of Chipolte, but couldn't articulate why. Just said \"we don't make you sick.\"  Couldn't answer questions about food quality. One word lazy answers. Turn off.  Food okay, but not hot and fresh. Hard to find worker when we needed napkins shortly after getting food. Owners of this place- better pay more attention!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken burrito bowl...not to impressed on the chicken it was a little on the dry side to the point that I will probably have to floss twice tonight, lettuce was starting to turn brown but other then that I would maybe go back if I had no other choice, I give it 2 shining stars."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone likes this place...this is the 2nd time I've been here and have left disappointed. I didn't even finish my meal. I tried the smothered steak burrito. The \"queso\" was cold and tastes like pickle juice. Their shit lettuce was wilting, and the steak was cold as well. My meal cost me $11 that I will never get back. At least the mountain dew was good and was cold as expected."}
{"text":"Food okay my steak was cold and the rice is over cooked. It's mush. Flavored are good and very fast service. Since they just open they will work out the kinks"}
{"text":"Got a steak bowl and wasn't impressed. Meat was dry and not very flavorful. Rice wasn't that tender. Chipotle's a lot better!"}
{"text":"I walked in a few days ago while game 6 was on and was immediately greeted by what seemed to be Owner/GM and by the gentleman working the counter. It was my first time in and was not sure what to get so I had questions, the man working the counter was very helpful and pointed me in the right direction. I ended up getting the barbacoa which was extremely flavorful And chips and queso. The burritos here are gigantic and depending on your spice level, they have salsas for everyone's tastebuds. I was a huge fan and will definitely be back to HotHead for my burrito fix."}
{"text":"Nachos are bad
Really cheap on the topping for $8
Meat taste old
Chips are old tasting 
Wasn't happy 
Will continue going to it's competition"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the portion is half of chipotle for the same price. Staff is what I give the one star for. Not helpful and rude. I asked for a cup of water and the cashier pointed to the cups with an expression on her face that said \"how could you not see those, take one.\" 

I will never come here again"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, they went cheap on everything, and the price has me believe it's fresh NOT!!! $1.00 extra to have bell peppers and onions on my $8.00 bowl. Will not be back! Go to Chipotle you will taste the difference"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burrito I had, and am looking forward to going back and trying the other food they offer. The employees are very nice and helpful in walking through the options that they offer for your toppings. The habanero sauce is absolutely delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food is delicious and comes in great portions. With employees that are nice and very helpful. Not to mention that there is not a lot around here for good food, so it is great addition to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and have had a good experience with the food being pretty decent. Today I bought my boyfriend steak nachos, with extra queso, regular toppings. When I went to pay it was 16$!!! They charged me 6.00 for extra queso! Saaaaaay what? The staff are super friendly and I didn't find it necessary to make a scene about it, but def won't be back!"}
{"text":"I like their burritos better than Chipotle's so I'm glad there's one in Southern Highlands. It's just more flavorful and I guess a little different since I believe this is one only one of itin Nevada."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this new burrito place down the street from my house. 


FINALLY hubby goes and gets me a veggie  burrito. 

The first thng I noticed was how small it was. I usially go to Whole Foods or Cafe Rio or even Qdoba , so I know my burritos . This was WAY small. For the same price as the others listed.

The second thing I noticed ..


The veggies inside were WAY to salty. I couldn't even finish. 

I am a vegan , so I.am pretty good with spices amd salt seasoning my food. 


Sorry guys we won't be back."}
{"text":"Burritos are loaded with los of rice, beans, and corn. .but a small little scoop of meat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place and have never had a problem until now. I ordered a pork burrito bowl and when we got home I realized the rice wasn't fully cooked  I couldn't eat the rice at all, I'm very disappointed and I think I will be going back to chipotle."}
{"text":"I love the food and all the options! It's the same concept as Chipolte and the offer of chocolate chip cookies and queso are totally Qdoba, but I'm pretty sure the flavors are a little different I wish the portions were a little bigger."}
{"text":"It's okay. Servings are extremely small even if you get the \"large\" bowl. Guacamole was nasty. It was way too sour. You can tell that they added way too much lime. They should not charge extra for this if it's gross anyways. You can't even taste the avocado. Onions were not fresh. They did not have the aroma or taste that onions have. The employee scooped it from the very bottom of the metal container. Their carne asada meat was also served very cold. I don't recommend this place. Employees did not really care either."}
{"text":"I was over in Mountain's Edge for once and a friend invited me to try Hot Head's. I am a fan of all the other chains like this so I agreed to give it a go after all how much different can it be since everyone uses the same couple of ingredients (couple of meats, rice, beans, etc...).

I was really impressed by Hot Head's! The individual ingredients were great (I got the pork like I usually do other places), but what really made it unique was all the sauce choices. I got the sweet habanero in the burrito and the hot head sauce on the side. Being able to mix and match sauces livens up the options instead of the same old combinations.

Service was super friendly, since the place is still really new I cut them some slack on the little stuff (two tries to roll the burrito, etc.) but none of it really effected my experience.

I will definitely be back when I am in the area, or hopefully when they open some closer to home or work!"}
{"text":"2 stars for friendly staff and clean business. Had the nachos. Pricey for size. Mainly flavorless taco meat and Blanco queso sauce. Imo Robertos you get better flavor and bang for your buck. Just the bland food will not see my return."}
{"text":"Food wasn't horrible, but definitely not in a rush to return. If you want actual Mexican food this is not your place. This is just another chipotle look alike but far more bland. Also the service was definitely lackluster. All in all, leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Yet again my first time visiting another lunchtime chain store; and I was not impressed really. The food was only \"OK\" and a bit bland. Plenty sauces to choose from if you know what you're doing; but it would need a lot to cover the tasteless food. I had the \"'lil bowl\" and a drink and with a side of guacamole it came to $9.68?! Wow...not good value for $$ in any language! The staff are very friendly and service is fast (it was empty for the most part at 11:45) Their credit card reader was also down so it was harder on them than usual They could give you a little more taco meat on the meal also. Don't think I'll be going back...."}
{"text":"Horrible. This place is an awful attempt at being like Chipotle or Zaba's. The food is stored in metal containers and the employees assemble your meal in front of you, the catch is that all the ingredients are either cold or room temperature(they only warm up the tortilla before making the burritos). I got really sick from eating here. I was sick to my stomach immediately after eating a burrito. All in all the options are very limited and the food is very bland. They have a list of sauces to add to your meal but they weren't as good as I expected. The sauces are only good for masking the blandness of the meat and fillings. The teenage kids working there were really attentive and friendly but the food was extremely disappointing. The prices were very affordable but the quality of the food was down right bad."}
{"text":"The description for two stars sums it up perfectly for me: Meh. I have had better, not just at Chipotle. From looking at the website and menu, I thought I was in for a fresher version of Chipotle at the very least.

The white rice in my burrito bowl was dry, the meat proportion was MEH and the guac tasted exactly like Wholly Guacamole that you might get prepackaged at the grocery store. I did take out, but I don't think the experience would have been any better in store, sorry. I hate to come down on a new place, but you won't find anything mind blowing here, IMO."}
{"text":"H first time here it is delicious tasty your pork is better than Café Rio lots of different sauces my husband is delighted that they have a wide array of spicy sauces and jalapeños galore. This is close to us and we will definitely return excellent food great value"}
{"text":"I am a frequent flyer at hot heads. This place is comparable to Chipotle and Qdoba but has more options for toppings and sauces. If you, like me, enjoy your burrito drenched in salsa and other sauces, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Burrito really good. Bowl not so good. They were pretty busy and seemed a bit flustered but they are brand new so understandable. The taco meet was great, not a typical option from these \"build-a-burrito\" places. I liked the sweet hananaro sauce and pineapple added, it gave great flavor. I'll definitely be back to try again."}
{"text":"Eh, very mediocre.  I bet this place is surviving on Chipotle's e coli debacle right now.  The chicken is chunk chicken so I ate around it once I saw it.  Salsa Fresca in Rocky River gets this right by fresh grilling their chicken, which I prefer because that is the way chicken comes.  With the exception of the salsa verde (green), all of the salsas need some help.  The corn is canned corn.  The Pico is completely flavorless.  The upside of this place?  You can order a smaller size burrito.  But that isn't enough for me.  The quality isn't there.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I came in to eat something small, i ordered their pork lil bowl and a small drink. I liked it. Its a new place so the workers behind the counter seem a little flustered but i think since its a new restaurant and people are training. Everyone there was nice and friendly, i will be back. This is a great alternate to Chipotle"}
{"text":"Customer service was good but the food itself was a little disappointing. I had the salad bowl- the lettuce was very cold and wet, and the meat (also a little cold) had no flavor to it."}
{"text":"Delectable, Delightful & Delicious! Been here already 5+ times and although my review is overdue, I had to let you know how amazing the burritos, bowls, tacos & quesadillas are (yes, I've tried them ALL). Very clean & organized and the sauces are amazing as well! OMG with the smothered burrito in queso! Never take it off the menu!!"}
{"text":"Great service , they are very informative and you can tell they enjoy there job. Food is for fresh and the flavors are amazing . 
Definitely worth the try. Once you go you will be hooked . Yummy !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"Make Your Own Burrito\" place. We will definitely be coming back. Affordable (Cost - More than Del Taco, less then a sit down, for the same type of food) My wife and I tried this place out right when they opened. I had a seasoned steak burrito and she went with the seasoned chicken quesadilla. They were so new they didn't have the \"flavored tortillas\" yet, so we went with traditional flour. They had a plethora of traditional and some non-traditional toppings. They eagerly gave samples of everything including meat and sauces. As my wife doesn't like super spicy and I like to turn on the fire, she went with pico and a mild hot sauce. I went with spicy salsa and their mango habanero sauce. They have 3 - 4 salsas and like 8 - 10 sauces...so experiment to find your fave. The two guys behind the counter were eager to please and worked with my wife's disability (as she is deaf). Everything was excellent. We don't like Roberto's that much due to there being way to much grease, and we don't go to Fausto's anymore because they don't hire anyone that speaks freaking English (thus everytime we get a messed up order) And the manager asked us to give them any feedback whether it was great or whether it was terrible. So here ya go guys!"}
{"text":"First time and won't be my last. Place is very clean and the staff super nice. Was talking to the manager there and he's super chill. The food isn't too bad. I actually like the sweet habanero sauce. I will definitely come back and recommend to my coworkers lol thanks for the rewards card as well :)"}
{"text":"We have been driving past this place for weeks and always curious about it. We like qdoba and chipotle so we wanted to compare. Let's put it this way, we've been back 5 times in three weeks. What keeps us hooked is the quesadillas for my wife and the spicy steak for me. I also highly recommend their signature sauces, my fave being the hot head sauce."}
{"text":"The fresh ingredients and yummy sauces blow the big chain competition out of the water. I especially love that Hot Head offers kids meals."}
{"text":"So good! Really glad I found this place. Loves me a good burrito. Good ingredients, lots of flavor, and best of all: they don't skimp on portion. These are good sized burritos. One of my favorite highlights is the 10 sauces ranging from \"mild to wild.\" They don't simply vary in spiciness; they're very distinct flavors. All very good. The hottest is called Straight Havanera, and it's no joke."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a 5 star rating, but I would say it's a 3.5, so they get a 4. It's great to see a new restaurant in the Strongsville area, they are very much needed, I am tired of seeing all the same fast food spots, there is way too many of them. 

This is in a great location on Pearl Rd, down the street from the Police Station. I was greeted by the workers as I walked in, glad to see some people still do that. Looks nice and clean inside, hopefully it remains that. 

I was glad to see a variety of options when it came to the food, tacos/bowls/burritos/quesadilla. All the ingredients looked fresh and delicious. I opted to go with the beef quesadilla, I was disappointed in how it looked, they should have just called it a crunch wrap supreme, looked just like it; it's not your typical looking quesadilla. I took it to go and they put it a plastic container that couldn't hold it flat, by the time I came home, it had broke in half from how it was laid out. It had a good taste to it, not something I would get next time,  but I will be back to try out the other menu items."}
{"text":"This is a great taco/ burrito place. Very clean and friendly. Try all their sauces! They are great ! I have ordered the bowl, taco and burritos. All wonderful. There are coupons in the entertainment book too!"}
{"text":"Tried Hot Head for the first time today.  I'll definitely be returning. It was like Chipotle but kicked up a couple notches. Loved the heat and various sauce options!"}
{"text":"Not awful but not good.  Meat had an odd taste.   Was also dried out (barbacoa).  With Salsaritas, Chipotle, and Moes nearby this place shouldn't last long.  I do have to say the young man who made our order was very polite and friendly.   The dinning room/area has way too many tables for the space.  Soda mix was right on the money.  The best part of the experience was a family of 3 ate for under $15.. beyond that Hotheads isn't hitting on much."}
{"text":"I came here after noticing the Starbucks. Polite staff. Nice selection of sauces. They explain how everything works, very easy. The prices were pretty low I thought too.  Next time I'll try a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Hot Head Burritos- the good, the bad and the ugly.  

Let's start with the good.  The dining area is new and clean.  The service was perfectly pleasant but they still seem to be training so the line moved a little slow.  I ordered the spicy chicken bowl with black beans, brown rice, sautéed onions (extra charge), corn salsa, guacamole and cheese.  They topped it with their hot salsa to make it 'spicy chicken '.  It was ok but not as good as their competitors.  

The Bad- We ordered the Queso of course because I love to try different restaurant styles.  Well I was highly disappointed.  It was bland and had a weird texture.  I asked for some hot salsa to try to improve the flavor.  No Bueno.  We didn't finish it and would recommend skipping this side item.  

The Ugly- Unfortunately I witnessed one of the workers take a piece of food from the prep area with her gloves on, eat it from her fingers and proceed with stirring the other items.  With the same gloves on she served up the next customer that walked in.  I don't know about you but I don't find that acceptable.  It made me wonder if she did that before I walked in.  

For this girl, I hesitate to visit again."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect from this place and I was pleasantly surprised with the entire experience. The atmosphere is great. The staff is great. The food is great. I got a barbacoa bowl which I thought was delicious and well seasoned. I also added their signature Hot Head sauce which was great too. As far as fast casual restaurants go, this place is a hit!"}
{"text":"I found it very similar to Chipolte. The pricing is similar and the portions seem similar as well. I had a barbacoa bowl and found the meat to not be as flavorful as chipolte. The queso was a welcome addition I think it added a different level of flavor to my meal. They have an abundance of sauces to add more flavor to your meal, I added hot head sauce which was tasty. The portion of cheese that I was given was a little small I had to ask for more cheese. They added a little too much lettuce for my taste."}
{"text":"I love hot heads.  The habanero sauces are delicious and for whatever it's worth, I've always felt welcome here.  Staff are upbeat and the food is great.  What more could you ask for :)"}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time today. It's VERY clean and the employee who was working was really friendly. Offered us to try anything and had a positive attitude. Also thanked us when we tipped him which goes a long way! The food is kind of bland but it's fresh and healthy :)"}
{"text":"If you like Qdoba and Chipolte you will LOVE Hot Head Burrito.  The sauces, chips and ingredients are much better quality and its about 30% cheaper.  It was my 1st time eating at this chain.  To Lynn who gave the 1 star.....this store just opened so cut them a little slack as they get their staff and crew up to speed, Lynn.  I was very impressed with the food quality and the price and the owner was on hand to insure that the staff gets up to speed on how to give great fast service.  I will for sure be going back here for lunch or dinner next time in the area.  A superior produce when compared to Qdoba / Chipolte.     They even had 2 huge flat panel TVs on the wall so I was able to watch the NFL playoffs as I dined in."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, staff is rude and if a halfway decent chick walks in they will serve her first. Food was very bland and had no flavor unless you drown it in sauce. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"So, I've always loved big, messy burritos. Ever since I moved to Cleveland years back and there was this great place in Cleveland Heights called \"Que Tal\" that served the first monster burritos I can remember. 

Well, they're gone now, and I've seen a few places, mostly chains, that do okay, but they could always use something more. 

Then, I stumbled in to Hot Head...and I'm feeling happy about burritos again:)

They're located in a little plaza off of Som Center Road, and they're easy to miss, but when you go in, you can custom make a burrito that healthy, tasty...and occasionally, HOTTER THAN HADES! 

They have almost a dozen sauces available, from mild to SWEET MOTHER OF MOSES hot, and, they even have PINEAPPLE, which I find very refreshing on a burrito the size of my torso:) 

The staff seemed a bit overworked, but I believe that might be because they're open 7 days a week and it appears to be a family operation. The folks were nice, though. Overall, I will be back at Hot Head, if for no other reason, I HAVE AT LEAST 11 MORE SAUCES TO TRY!! 

(one thing I would really like to see on the menu;salads. They have burrito bowls and burritos, but I did not see a taco salad on there, and with the combo of stuff they offer, that would be one HECK of a salad:) 

So, if you're looking for a tasty lunch that WILL fill you up, don't be cool, get HOT with Hot Head!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing but the one thing that stands out is speed of service. Unlike some other fast casual Mexican Grill's there is seldom a line."}
{"text":"Yeah...about that last review...I take it back. I'm sorry other fast casual burrito place. My wife picked me up a burrito for lunch today and when I went to eat it, I noticed it was tiny. Like it kind of looked like a red foiled tennis ball tiny. Anyway I was hungry so I opened it up and there was so much overlapping tortilla, at first I thought it was double wrapped. I investigated further and realized that it was just overlap because there was hardly anything inside. I estimate a half scoop of rice and I think I counted 5-6 pieces of chicken on the entire burrito. It was pretty much all pico de gallo and corn salsa. Very disappointing. After this experience I don't think I'll be back. I just think for the price and what I received that I was totally ripped off. This was a Taco Bell sized burrito at best with fast casual prices. I really wanted to love Hot Heads...but I've come to realize it was just a crush."}
{"text":"This place is so good!  It's the usual build-a-burrito concept done well, and then they set themselves apart with the sauces.  The hot heads sauce is an herby-garlicky mix that goes well with everything, and if you want heat, the hotter habanero sauces are there for you.  I was done with Chipotle long ago, and now it might be curtains for Qdoba.  If you're in Southern Highlands and need a burrito immediately, you are now good to go."}
{"text":"Hot Head Burritos is an Ohio based chain that just opened up in the Southern Highlands area at Southern Highlands Pkwy and Cactus in the center near Smith's and Subway. 

The concept is simple. It's pretty much just like Chipotle in which you pick what you want and go down the line of items and let them know what you want. The menu options are burritos, bowls, tacos, nachos or quesadillas. Then they have various ingredients you can add: plain or brown rice, black or pinto beans, pico, corn, verde salsa, wild salsa, sour cream, cheddar or monterey jack cheeses, lettuce, banana peppers, jalapeños, onions, and guacamole ($1.00 upcharge).

The thing that differentiates them from being labeled as just another Chipotle rip-off is the fact that they have a bunch of different sauces that you can put on top to give it an extra kick or flavor like Hot Head sauce, Tabasco chipotle, Cholula hot sauce, honey bbq, ranch, sweet habanero, taco sauce, buffalo sauce, extreme habanero, and straight habanero.

For what it was, it was good, not great. Don't roll up in here expecting the second coming of the Chipotle Gods but if you are looking for something very similar with a bit of a different flair, it'll do the trick. I didn't notice any gristle on the meat, like I have at Chipotle, which is why I stopped eating there. Plus, Chipotle has had some big issues lately with an e. coli outbreak in many locations so I wouldn't risk it, at the very least until they get all that straight. I'd give Hot Head Burritos a shot instead and see what you think."}
{"text":"I should have scaled back my expectations when I found out this was a burrito chain from Ohio, of all places- not a state known for a quality Mexican cuisine or much in the way of spice. However, with family in the buckeye state, I gave Hot Head the old college try.

Chipotle-style ordering counter and menu, I opted for a salad with barbacoa, chicken, and black beans. Their focus seems to be on their selection of sauces- the ranch dressing and barbecue sauces being odd and unnecessary, for those ordering salads, few seem appropriate.  The taco sauce and signature hot head sauce were both flavorful but lacked any of the heat I'd want with my Mexican food. Unclear why ranch is the only plausible dressing for salads, suggest adding a cilantro-lime vinaigrette or cream dressing and remove the ranch altogether."}
{"text":"Im adding another review for the second time we came in. I had a coupon from the entertainment app but the manager on duty had a hard time with it, but she apologized and let us sit down and eat while she rang up the other customers and phoned her boss on how to put the coupon in. She had it figured out by the time we were done eating and apologized again and offered us free chips and queso for the inconvenience. im pretty patient so i didnt have an issue with having to wait for her to do the coupon but i thought she demonstrated great customer service and she was very patient with the whole ordeal also. I wish i had paid attention to her name but once i go back i will update again :).  The food was still great, i look forward to coming back here many more times."}
{"text":"More like 'Not-so-Hot' Head Burrito. Their portions were smaller and prices were bit higher than their main competitor.  The taste was ok but not close to other places.  Did like the roasted veggies option.  The kids meal was super small and didn't have great drink options.  
It was a little unclear what toppings were included and workers weren't sure either. It became more obvious at checkout when they messed up our coupon twice. 
We were disappointed since it was so convenient to us but they have a long way to go to touch Chipotle."}
{"text":"Way better than the other fast food Mexican with fresh ingredients and awesome salsas. Went in for the 1st time and we didn't know about the salsas or sauces and they gave us two to try, hothead and sweet habanero. And afterward, we told them how good it was and they gave us each a free taco card! Can't wait to go back-to-back just wish they had more of them and one closer to us."}
{"text":"Meh is right.  I was hoping for something tasty and actually mexican food tasting.  This is not it. It is fresh food, it is cooked ok, and very edible - but if you are looking for something actually tasting like Mexican food - this is barely a step above Del Taco.

The chips, for chips amd queso, I swear were Santitas right out of the bag. 

Too bad - this will not be a go to place. 

It was $27.55 for a small steak quesadilla, barbacoa burrito, 2 little zip lock bags of Santitas chips (swear - ziplock bags), and queso and guac.... MY GOSH - go to Macayos"}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly staff, food below par. Went for the first time and I have to admit the place was kept very clean. The staff was friendly, helpful, and polite. The burrito was not very good at all. I ordered a steak burrito. The steak was well done, room temperature, with very little flavor. The entire burrito itself was bland. If you're a fan of chipotle you will be disappointed with the quality of food here. The prices seem to be a little lower than chipotle. If you like Mexican food in general, you will be disappointed. If you are not a fan of Mexican food, you will love this place. 2 stars, 1 for service and the second for cleanliness."}
{"text":"New place in Mayfield next to Five Guys. Similar to Chipotle but with options to add sauces. Ordered a spicy steak bowl with white rice, picante salsa, lettuce, onions, cheese, and sour cream. Asked for a suggested sauce and was given the signature hot head sauce. Even with the sauce and the spicy steak, everything was very bland and dry. The steak was very dry and tough - almost seemed like it was frozen. The rice was dry and bland. The toppings were very scarce...very little cheese, lettuce or sour cream. Guacamole or queso sauce could be added for an additional $1.  I personally would stick with Chipotle or QDoba - better taste and quality."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I mean, I do, but I wanted to like it enough to add into my lunch rotation.

Now, don't get me wrong - the food here is fresh and pretty tasty, but I do feel like everything lacks flavor. Veggies also cost extra :(! Their sauces are nothing special and the queso they serve up... Dare I say the melted cheese from a plastic vat is better? Yes. It's very runny and even has a watered-down taste to it. Ick.

Service is good and prices are OK. They have a rewards program as well. Unfortunately I don't see myself coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Chipotle and Qdoba...figured this would be good too. Recommended by a friend. Nope...don't trust his food judgement any longer. The food was tasteless. The meat, which was supposed to be somewhat spicy, had no flavor, and was dry/overcooked.  Even with a fairly flavorful sauce over the top, the food was bland.  Overall, I was underwhelmed. I did not finish what I bought, and tossed it. Typically, leftover Chipotle follows me home. 

Also weird? The staff behind the counter shouting chants. Thank you, I don't need a cabaret, just my lunch please. AND STOP SHOUTING AT ME!!!   That's as weird as coming across the WalMart employees doing their little pep rallies out on the sales floor."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went here for lunch and I have to say, it was below average. I ordered a chicken bowl and my husband ordered a steak burrito. It was very bland and tasted like the rice, beans, queso cheese and salsa had been sitting for awhile, meaning it didn't taste fresh. My husband didn't like his burrito and said the steak had zero flavor. The staff was friendly and the dining room was clean. Maybe we got them on a bad day!"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The employees look so \"over it\" and have no interest in good customer service.  The meats are very plain and the whole meal is overpriced.  Crappy white yuppie wannabe Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hot Head Burrito in Strongsville is a decent place for lunch. It's very much like Chipotle. If you're familiar with Chipotle (adding to your order as you advance on the line) you'll find Hot Head Burrito very similar. 

I ordered the same thing I usually get at Chipotle: a burrito bowl with chicken. Hot Head Burrito offers similar components: brown or white rice, brown or black beans, grilled zucchini, fajita onions & peppers, meat (chicken, steak, pork, barbacoa and taco meat), cheese, lettuce, corn, guacamole and a variety of salsas. 

The food itself was OK. I found the rice and beans to be bland. The chicken was lightly seasoned. The veggies (zucchini) were a nice touch; something Chipotle doesn't offer. 

The service was friendly. A few times it seemed like the server wasn't paying attention to what I was actually saying (for instance he asked me if I wanted rice. I asked \"What are the choices, brown and white rice?\" And he proceeded to add white rice to my bowl.) but overall the service was fine. 

The restaurant is very clean and much less noisier than Chipotle. It is also less busy. I was there at lunchtime (noon) and there were only 2 other diners and no one on line. 

The price of my meal was a little higher than Chipotle. $17 for 2 burrito bowls & 1 drink. 

There is plenty of free parking right outside. It is near a bakery, pita shop, pizza place, beauty supply & grilled cheese diner. 

All in all, the food at Hot Head Burrito was fine and service was good. However, if I had to choose, I'd dine somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place when my friend told me about it as an option to Chipotle and Qdoba.  The menu is similar to the other restaurants (burrito, bowl, tacos, quesadillas) but they also have nachos with choice of toppings, which sounds interesting, but it didn't really look like a meal.  I think what most excited me about this place was their 13 choices of sauce that you can add to your meal.. (and I think that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 star).   To me, if you are going to compete against Chipotle, you need to do one of two things... you need serve a better product or a cheaper product.  Hot Head Burritos did neither.  Their meals are more expensive than Chipotle and their ingredients are nowhere near the quality, especially the meat.  My 3 friends and I were very disappointed after we left since it didn't meet our expectations.  I got the burrito bowl which seemed like a smaller portion than Chipotle.  Also the scoop of guac was $1 but was so small that it was basically non-existent in my bowl.  The one bright spot was their \"Green Pepper\" sauce and the \"Hot Head Sauce\".    The restaurant and kitchen were both clean and the employees were very nice."}
{"text":"I stopped in there for the 1st time tonight and picked up a burrito.  It was outstanding, great flavor, outstanding friendly staff, would definitely recommend over Chipotle and Qdoba.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Wonderful, fresh ingredients and many choices to build your burritos. I always go for the bowl, since I'm doing the low carb thing. The staff is pretty friendly and they have a good selection of beverages too. The Barbacoa is lovely."}
{"text":"Very average.   Trying to complete with Chipotle and Zabbas.   Not as good.   My burrito was totally cold,  special sauces were never offered..   Will not be back"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, have tried it 3 times hoping it would get better and it hasn't. Today was the same as usual the rude employee (loud, reddish hair) rushing me through, didn't even give me a chance to get sauces. Aren't the sauces their big gimmick? When I asked for some she looked annoyed. 
The food has been ok the last couple of times. Nothing spectacular just ok. Today it was not good at all. The rice was beyond undercooked and everything was flavorless. I wish this place would get better but after three tries I'm figuring this is as good as it's going to get."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to check out Hot Head Burritos. I noticed the sign the last time I went on a Target run and just had to bookmark this place for later. Can I start off this review by saying that I love Mexican food. I also love burritos. Not to mention, I am a huge fan of Chipotle (or at least I was, I'll admit I haven't been since its been in the news). So, it makes me sad that I left Hot Heads completely disappointed. 

During my visit to Hot Head there were only two other groups there. I walked to the front, looked at the menu and realized that this place was similar to Chipotle-- sweet! I was pretty excited to get my bowl on! As I stand there ready to order, I realize that there is no one there to help me! I hear some talking in the kitchen. This tall guy looks over and sees me, and then looks away. Um, okay. So, I stand there patiently. Finally after like 10 minutes, a girl comes from the other way and tells me that she will be right back. At this point, my friend wanted to leave. I would have just agreed but I had hope this place would be amazeballs. She finally comes back and takes our order. Just like Chipotle, I go down the counter and I pick all the things I want on my bowl. She gave me decent sized portions, but that may just be the guilt because she knew that I waited for so long. 


The moment of truth: the food kind of sucked. Okay, it sucked a lot. Between the bowl, the burrito and the nachos that we ordered-- none of it was REALLY good. Nothing special. Which makes it even worst was that this was my cheat meal for the week. Maybe that just added fuel to the fire of disappointment. Even though their little flame logo and their decor is pretty darn cute, I will not be going back to Hot Head any time soon."}
{"text":"Don't know how it's even possible but my coworker ordered a 17 dollar meal. It would have cost 11 at another very similar restaurant. The extra habenero sauce was super sweet with very little heat. I did like that you could add hot peppers. Probably won't go back. To expensive. The service was fast."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of chipolte but the quality is not even close to that. I was not impressed. They use a funky tasting seasoning on their meats as well. Produce like lettuce amd tomatoes were soggy as well"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Lots and lots of options, more than chipotle a close comparison to each. Well priced. Spicy options of meats and sauces for those who love spicy food like myself."}
{"text":"Had a small burrito with barbacoa beef.  Was just the right size and really good with hot head sauce.  Staff was friendly and helpful with menu items.  Will be back again.  Also tried sweet habanero sauce, that was really god."}
{"text":"Just like chipotle. Hopefully without the E. coli. What sucks is it costs twice as much as chipotle."}
{"text":"Service was great but food was very bland. Really disappointed with taste or lack of. Tastes like menu was created in South Dakota instead of any kind of Mexican or Hispanic had anything to do with the menu"}
{"text":"I had high expectations and I had a coupon so I was really excited about trying this place we drive past all of the time.

We wanted one bowl and one burrito.  From the moment I stepped in I felt comfortable with a layout just like so many other places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle.  But the signage seemed to be missing on where to order so I stood in the wrong place, by the cash register since that is where the layout seemed to direct me.  Once corrected, I dealt with a young lady who just didn't seem to have any expereince in doing the job.  She seemed to expect me to add some ingredients and seemed surprised when I didn't.  

What mostly annoyed me was at 6pm on a Thursday there was a wait of 15 minutes for chicken.  How in the middle of dinner service can you be so far behind on having chicken prepared.  I could see it all on the stove top but was quoted 15 minutes before I could get any.  No real explanation or apology.  In fact I never got any idea that any of the staff cared including the guy who seemed to be in charge.  No offer that if I waited they would make me a discounted offer or something.  I called my girlfriend who wanted the chicken and she agreed to get the steak, I had the spicy pork (which wasn't spicy).

The food was fair, not especially hot nor flavorful and not better than Cafe Rio or Chipotle.  But the service was worse or at least uncaring.  Management needs to work on inspiring the employees to show some care for the customers.

The value was not there, we both didn't even think the serving size was worth the discounted $6 we paid ofr each let alone the $7.49 regular price.  No salsa bar, but you can get them to put their sauces on the product but it would have been better if I could have had them on the side and could have tried different ones.

Overall, we were left with the opinion that the food was fresh but that was the only real positive.  Maybe we will try again, maybe it was just this one location or just a bad night.  But there are alternatives that have not let us down and whose portions seem bigger for the same price point."}
{"text":"Great place!  The manager and his staff are friendly, caring and very professional.  As we waited for our order, the manager chatted with us and thanked us repeatedly for our business.  My wife and I will be back.  Food was fresh and as I stated previously, the service was fantastic!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Best burrito place in town! Service is also really great too. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"We have another Mexican restaurant in our little nieghborhood..a thumbs up. It's like a Chipotle without the food poisoning, really good for vegans. Friendly staff..if you've haven't been there yet, and it's your 1st time. I'd suggust you look at menu 1st, you can pick up a menu and circle the items you want..The pork is awesome, carnitas..the spicy chicken is delicious..black beans, white rice, very much like Chipotle..Very fresh ingredients.."}
{"text":"Update:  the manager approached us after our meal and asked us for our honest feedback.  We appreciated this very much and we told him the truth.  He apologized and asked us to come back and try the restaurant again, on him.  Very good management.  We hope to be able to give a better rating next time.

This was our first time here and it will be our last.  We give the food 2 stars - bland and not warm enough (meat was room temp).  The service was somewhat better than the food - we were politely greeted upon arrival.  But the Line server was afraid to over portion our bowls and she served my wife the last few soggy veggies and steak.  This place is obviously a cheap knock off of Chipotle. However chipotle is much better in every aspect which is where we will go next time."}
{"text":"Average nothing special. This location is set up a little weird. 1) the area where you line up to order is confusing because there's no sign and narrow space. So when it's busy I notice people either cutting in front of others, by accident, or don't know where to order. 2) you don't know where to return the trays and throw away trash so it's either left on the tables or just stacked up next to the soda machine. The food: it's pretty much like a Chiplote, same concept but with a few more items. I ordered a chicken burrito which was just ok. Actually a little bland but it did its job. I understand this is a brand new location so to be fair I'll come back a few more times and try more items."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food yet clean and fresh will definitely be back for more highly recommended, I like ally better than chipotle or zabas munu fast easy and fresh"}
{"text":"I like Hot Head so much better than Chipotle!  The workers are all super nice and they don't rush you through the line like cattle at a trough.  Their chicken is wonderful and juicy.  Lots of great sauces to choose from.  I like the sweet and hot styles and they have various levels of heat in this category."}
{"text":"I finally had the courage to give his spot a try. I usually go to chipotle but since this was closer to my home I went here instead. Here's a list of pros and cons.

Cons - the workers were so unprofessional. Not one of them asked me if I was ready to order or acknowledged me. 2 of the female workers were busy goofing off with their buddies. When I went to pay one of the workers' buddy reached over to playfully hit her right in front of me which I had to avoid him. I thought that was really rude and unprofessional. When I was picking selections I kept asking questions about certain items and the female worker looked annoyed that i was asking them. So I just made my selection quick and simple. It took forever to ring my order up because again the female worker was too busy chatting with her buddies.

Pros - it's close to my house

The food wasn't that good. The chicken was dry, the rice was tasteless, the pico de gallo was very mushy and bland. I finally tried it and I won't ever come back. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go to chipotle or hell even del taco across the street is better than this dump."}
{"text":"I experienced Hot Head for the first time yesterday. There was a steady flow of customers coming through the door which isn't surprising due to it being a beautiful day in Strongsville. Everyone was greeted with enthusiastic \"welcome\". I had a chicken burrito with a side of chips and salsa. The burrito was great. I love that they have fajita style veggies to choose from. Plus, their queso was delicious. There are so many sauces to choose from to accompany your dish. The chips were pretty bland, not the yellow corn tortilla chips I'm used to, but the medium salsa was so good! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! 1st time trying this place and completely blown away! Love the vegetarian bowl. Hot head sauce fantastic!!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, This place is horrible!  This is not Mexican food! Every item we ordered tasted like it came out of a microwave or frozen food section of dollar store.  I've got indigestion already and hopefully will not need bottle of pepto."}
{"text":"Really bummed out. Went back for a second time. However this time burrito was very small and pathetic. It was only rice, beans and cheese. The cost was $6.95. Big ripoff. The manager made my burrito. Dude look 
Rice and beans cost pennies. The least you could do is make it a decent size. Burritos are big not the size of a taquito. If I want small I will go to taco bell. I will go back. However  I will speak up about the size next time. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"First time. Food was good. Sauces were great. Had the hothead and Cholula. 
Chronic tacos could use a lesson from this place. Not bad prices. 2.50 for a chicken taco..
Place was clean, bathrooms clean and stocked. The employees were helpful to this newbie and I think Ill be back to try other offerings, like nachos."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Better than chipotle flavor and bowl mix (less rice heavy), and a very attentive and speedy staff.  Staff did a good job of making requested adjustments e.g. a dab of sour cream."}
{"text":"Not only are the burritos amazing the staff are always so friendly, literally everytime my husband and I come to this location we leave smiling because of how great the staff members are, always happy and friendly. The foods ALWAYS on point with so much more variety than chipotle."}
{"text":"Lunch Review - pricey, inconsistent, with an unhappy staff

Be sure to stay in your lane... do not deviate... do not try and state the ingredient before your bowl / tortilla / chips gets to a station... you will be asked again... the poor staff member will stare at you with blank confusion if you rattle off each station in order even... poor hubby... he is good at these meal by process flow things... he had a hard time slowing down to the pace of his bowl... he never has an issue at Chipolte.

They will double check if you want just pork or spicy pork... but don't expect to be asked if you want a full bowl or a little bowl... and I had no clue there was a 2 meal deal until I looked on the website when I got home... I found the whole thing much more confusing than Chopolte for some reason... maybe the unhappy staff person who could only respond to single words? 

My plain pork sure was... no seasoning... not dry... but no taste... 
Corn \"salsa\"... no seasoning... corn. red onion. cilantro bits... but no taste...
Cheese... might as well have left it off... no taste...

BBQ Sauce... is NOT mild... it is a solid high medium... they can leave off the little dancing flames if they want... it is in no way missing heat.

The whole thing tasted terribly salty... I ran my selections through their online nutrition calculator... huge boo for the 1700mg of sodium.... with that much salt there sure shouldn't have been a seasoning issue.

Poor hubby decided on sour cream... in it's 10g of fat glory... woops!

I picked up a loyalty card and the cashier held out their hand for it... didn't say a word... and I was given two stickers for our order... I thanked him... I got a \"oh, yeah.\"

Would stop here again if Chipolte was busy (which it was... there was a line almost to the door) but would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Super fresh ingredients too! The owner is very engaging with the customers and came out to check on everyone to make sure they had what they needed.  Seriously we have eaten there 3 or 4 times already and each time was delicious. I got the spicy steak, my wife got chicken once a quesadilla once and our son gets 4 tacos. You definitely need to eat there you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fast service good food! I think they have more options than chipotle, also with the while E. Coli situation going on HotHeads is a better alternative."}
{"text":"I went to Hot Head Burritos for lunch. As many of the other reviews have mentioned, lines are a lot shorter that Chipotle so you can get in and out rather quickly. I opted for a steak burrito with white rice, pice de gallo, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and Extreme Habanero sauce. The staff was nice and friendly. I should have requested to taste the extreme habanero sauce first because it was not what I expected at all; it wasn't very spicy and it actually had a sweetness to it. It tasted like I would have expected the Sweet Habanero sauce to taste. I wound up going back to request a side of the Straight Habanero sauce which added some spice to my burrito. The portions are huge. They have some options that you can not find at Chipotle such as quesadillas and nachos as well as some additional toppings. Overall wasn't bad but towards the end of my burrito the lettuce was a little soggy (they use iceburg) and I was just too overwhelmed with all that sweetness so I was unable to finish it. I would def go again however. I think this place is like chipotle as far as you have to find \"your formula\". I will say though I expected much more spice given the name of the restaurant and some of the sauces. I know my heat tolerance can be a little more than some but I expected more heat."}
{"text":"Amazing! Meat choices are incredible. Sauce selection is unlike any Chipotle or Qdoba. I will be recommending this to everyone. Thank you to George, the manager, for helping us make a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple.  Don't subject yourself to this food.  I should have trusted my instincts and walked out from the first greasy smell that I noticed when we walked in the door.  Not nice commentary, I know, but this place served us food that was easily surpassed in taste and quality by the hospital down the road (please, don't be offended CC).  On the positive side, we were able to dump the food and get out quickly.  We would have talked with the manager but had to get going to pick up our son at a location about 30 minutes away.  I remember the worst dorm food that I had, and wish that that I could have eaten that meal instead of Hot Head Burrito.  Sorry HHB, this is horrible fare."}
{"text":"Super excited about this place! Stopped in to check out the food as we are new to Henderson, and can definitely affirm that we were not left disappointed. My husband, our two young (cranky/tired) boys, and myself came in after a long day preparing for a business trip. Right away we were greeted by the owner, who was super professional, warm, and customer oriented. It's rare these days when you notice a business is owned and operated by people who actually care about customer service (almost in a family type way) where they want to meet you face to face and have an actual conversation- instead of the usual \"stare, ask, and scoop-the-food\" attitude. We let our attendant know that it was our first time, and herself- along with the owner went down the selection of food and explained everything we could chose in great detail-which made it way easier when it's your first time. You're not left there in bitter silence while they wait for you to figure out what might sound good just by looking at a menu board. Everything was fresh, clean, piping hot and delicious. You've definitely got forever customers in us. Thanks again for a great stop-in experience. You're doing it right!"}
{"text":"Prices are high for what you get unless you get a burrito. Staff was extremely disorganized and not very friendly. Ordered two items and the entire process was frustrating and awkward. Took my to-go nachos home with no lid, because they couldn't figure out how to cover them without crushing them. Were a complete mess by the time we got back to the house. Stingy with toppings. Got a whole four or five jalapeno slices. My partner's quesadilla was just ok. Value was certainly not worth almost 8 bucks. 

Watched a guy unable to figure out how to wrap a burrito without all the insides falling out while we were waiting, and another unable to figure out how to wrap two tacos up in a to go wrapper. It's not rocket science.

I understand that they just opened around a week ago, but very few of the staff seemed to be more than half trained."}
{"text":"First, the service was great. Really they were super nice and friendly. But I wasn't impressed with the burritos or the salsas. i thought they were going to be spicy, nothing was spicy. I normally go to Faustos and spend $13.00. This place cost me $21.00 and it was just disappointing. i would spend $22.00 at Rubios (I love ttheir salsas, it's best) anytime, than come back here. My son loves burritos. He throw away half of it. We just didn't like it."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a burrito guy but I love this place. Absolutely fantastic! I had it smothered and it took it to the next level."}
{"text":"First off place is clean with decent decor . Service was good and one girl even asked how everything was . Wow customer service  . OK got the burrito bowl . Similar to Chipotle but different. . Got charged for the guacamole which is fine but it was already going bad you could see by color . Food was good but not great .In short I will go back for a quick bite ."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of chipotle so I thought this place would be a good idea. It was just gross  they didn't season anything ! It was waste of money for me."}
{"text":"I work next door so i eat here very often. I usually get the chicken quesadilla which is a good size so I'll eat half for lunch & half for dinner. I love most of their sauces & even taste great with plain ol sour cream. I've had the chicken bowl also. The brown rice is a lil crunchy but still good. Staff is super nice! If you need help ordering, just ask! I'm really suprised at the not so good reviews this place has gotten cause I've always gotten great food & great service. They are new so if you aren't happy, tell em! I'm sure they'll make it right."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love this place, its more than just your average burrito joint with all the different combinations of ingredients and sauces you have to choose from.  They also have some of the best specials in town from their Facebook Friday deals that varies to the 2 for 10.99 after five Mondays

Always has fast and friendly service and cleanliness is A+

My favorite combination is the jalapeño cheddar wrap w/brown rice, black beans, spicy chicken, corn salsa, guacamole w/ both cheeses and top it off with one of their 12 sauces but typically I choose a honey BBQ"}
{"text":"Stopped by chance but we will return on purpose! The service was friendly, the food was fresh and delicious. I had a shrimp bowl and the shrimp was cooked to order. My Mom had a small steak burrito and loved it."}
{"text":"There's literally no difference between this place and Chipotle except for the fact that they offer ranch dressing for burritos. I just can't get behind this practice, pure burrito blasphemy! 

The set up is the Subway/Chipotle style in which you choose the meat, the meat holder (burrito or bowl), beans and all the toppings. You then get to choose from a multitude of sauces and dressings. Like these gems Sweet habanero, Straight up habanero, Honey BBQ, Taco Sauce? Ranch?!, Xtreme Habanero and a few others. I went with the chicken burrito with all the fixings and the Sweet Habanero sauce. 

This was a basic chicken burrito with decent flavor, but nothing really to excite the senses. The Sweet Habanero sauce had no hint of heat at all and I know that they state this on the website, but then why even mention habanero in the title, just say it's sweet sauce. It reminded me more of the McDonald's Sweet and Sour sauce used for their nuggets. Pink Slime or not, they're still tasty. 

\"Just Say No\" to ranch on burritos!"}
{"text":"We received a BOGO coupon for a burrito or bowl and decided to go eat dinner here after shopping at Target. I went with the burrito and added a couple salsas and spice to it. Food and service was great and will definitely come back to try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Very tasty, great selection of salsas. Love the queso dip. Chips are fresh. Friendly staff. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Taco Bell blows this place away. First and last time here!  The taco meat as no flavor, just gross."}
{"text":"Delicious. Place was clean and staff was very friendly. I am disabled and someone carried my food to the table. 

I had spicy steak bowl combo (chips and drink). Fair price for food freshness and solid atmosphere. Better than Chipotle . Way better."}
{"text":"I read that this was one of the top new franchises so had to try it. Meats and veggies were barely warm, tortillas became very doughy and I ended up eating very little of it. Employees seemed disorganized as well. Improvement necessary as there are so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place I go in once a week n the steak  burritos are amazing.The hot head sauce is so flavorful. The service has always been good , the food is fresh and the restaurant is clean and sanitary.  Maybe they have some inconsistency issues but it's a new business and I welcome them into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I personally prefer it over chipotle as I was able to customize my lil bowl with different sauces. Lil bowl is a perfect sized bowl. Generous portion for single serving.  Sweet habanero sauce is amazing! Been here 5 times since they've opened and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I had a good first experience here. The owner was really nice, helpful and informative about the restaurant. However this follow up experience was absolutely horrendous. We walk in around 9PM and are barley greeted by a group of 16 year old employees. One employee even yells \"fuck\" at the top of her lungs for no reason. Fast forward to when I'm eating, said employee starts blaring music so loud it made it hard to sit and enjoy my food. All 3 employees then sit down with a friend who comes by to hangout. All not doing their job and yelling and screaming. That same employee then shouts over at us and says \"do you hate my music\" and starts laughing. I hope the owners of this place read this as I will never return to this restaurant. And as an employee in customer service for over 5 years, I was absolutely disgusted with how these employees conducted themselves."}
{"text":"This establishment didn't do anything wrong but it also did nothing right. I've ordered burritos on two occasions and both occasions were disappointing. 
All of the ingredients are bland except for the habanero hot sauce which can't salvage the food. 
Service is fine, it's not offensive, I don't have anything negative to say about the hygiene or cleanliness of the place. It's just a place I will never go again because the food is so terrible. It's like Chipotle without the E Coli. If your standards are low enough to like chipotle, you might like this place. If you like actual food that tastes decent, you should probably find another establishment to dine at."}
{"text":"First time here and I can say the people are so polite I love it.. One guy say have a beautiful day and it made me happy.. On top of it the burrito bowl I had was great defiantly would stop in again an try something different"}
{"text":"You decide if you want a burrito,  bowl or taco. After you choose your meat you also choose what you want on it and some things to pick was white rice, brown rice, pico, lettuce, cheese, squash, zucchini, jalapeño peppers, banana peppers, onions, beans, salsa, sour cream and corn. They offered 10 different sauces and we tried 4 and liked them all. I had a burrito and loved it. I tried the chips and salsa and loved the chips; fresh  nicely salted with with a great crunch. They also had quesadillas and nachos. The employees were all nice and occasionally  walked around asking if we needed anything. I am so glad this place opened up in our area and look forward to visiting often."}
{"text":"Hotheads is pretty good. They have a variety of choices from bowls to burritos. They have a jalapeno cheddar tortilla that makes your burrito that much better. Many sauces to choose from to top off your creation with many different levels of spiciness for you to select. Our favs are their chicken and pork. The staff always greets you with a smile and their portions are pretty big. Check them out."}
{"text":"Update: The food is still 5 stars... but after going here at least 50 times I get over charged 75% of the time! Management here really sucks

I order a small bowl and small burrito with double meat. It should be $1 extra but they almost always charge $2, even though it says $1 on the menu.

I am contemplating just stopping going here as it is not my job to train their staff and it gets very annoying as this happens almost every time!

Frankly I am very irritated by this. A shame because the food is great"}
{"text":"Really good chicken bowls and burritos!! Plus I love the fact they have so many sauces and the staff is very friendly. Atmosphere is cute a modern great for lunch! Try the hot heads sauce you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Sweet sauces on the whitest wanna-be chipolte food ever? Not good at all. The person who reviewed saying it's the best in Vegas has clearly never had actual Mexican food. 

They put the guac on the bottom of the burrito in the corner so when they rolled it up it stays all in one spot. 

\"corn salsa\" is just corn. nothing else that you would expect in a corn salsa. 

pico de gallo is nothing more than chopped tomatoes nothing else that again one would expect. 

the habanero sauce is good but not for Mexican food. 

portions are tiny, meat is very plain tasting. 

overall it's pretty gross and I gave them two chances thinking that maybe because they are new that the first time was bad."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Delicious and freshly made food. Food was good and the customer service was even better. Bettina and Breanna welcomed us with a big smile. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Let's be 100% honest this was on the same level as chipotle very similar concepts I enjoyed it but with Fausto's and Roberto's around this is never going to be my first choice l, for what it is, asembly line america-mex, it's  is worthy of repeat visits because it does have a good flavor

When you want Mexican food got to go to Faustus or Roberto's or nice Mexican go to Lindo"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this little spot forever! I finally stopped in tonight and was pretty disappointed... The menu and layout are pretty much that of a Chipotle (which is delicious) but I feel like when it comes to food, this place cuts corners on just about everything. I just can't get behind a mexican resraurant that doesn't make their own guac. Don't charge me $4 to squeeze some pre-made and shipped to you nastiness out of a bag for me. Also, the veggies are pretty gross and taste like they're straight out of a can. 

To the owners of this franchise: business wise, if you're going to copy Chipotle, you gotta at least be equal to them or better in quality.... They make their own guac... just saying."}
{"text":"Love the food. I prefer a hot head over Chipotle. But I think they're going through some growing pains. Very young staff. Food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Really good, a nice alternative to Moe's or Chipotle with it's own unique flavors that help it stand out. The set up can be a bit confusing at first but once you get used to it it's fine. The kids meal sizes are a bit too small though, it wasn't even enough for my 4 year old much less my 6 year old. 

My first attempt was pretty bland and definitely a 3 star experience but my second was good after I figured out how to really layer up the toppings and sauces. 

The main reason for a 4 instead of 5 is the prices and confusing set up (you can't see the menu board from against the counter well part is on one side the other around a corner)."}
{"text":"Hot Head Burritos is a build-your-own-meal style restaurant; a dining concept that is taking over the fast food industry, and made famous by the likes of Chipotle and Shake Shack. 

Going head-to-head with Chipotle, Hot Head attempts to set themselves apart with a couple of menu options not found at it's competitors, like a jalapeño cheddar tortilla, or a selection of 10 different sauces to top off your creation. Unfortunately this location does not offer the Hot Head Craft Burritos & Bowls, which is really a shame, because that could be the game changer for them. 

Where they do hit the mark, however, is their offering of a \"Li'l\" Burrito or Bowl for those counting calories, or for those not wanting to carry a 6 lb. burrito around in their belly all afternoon. A delightful \"right-size\" meal in a world of super size menus. It's more than enough food, trust me. 

At the end of the day, Hot Head Burritos isn't going to knock your socks off, but they do what they do, and they do it well. Service is friendly, restaurant is clean, and the options are plenty. 

How many fast food burrito chains the market can bear is another question altogether, but I'd recommend checking out Hot Heads Burritos for a change of pace, especially if fast food burritos are a part of your regular dietary menu."}
{"text":"I like chipotle. I mean, I really like chipotle...

A new (to me) burrito place? Skeptic.

I'd place Hot Head in between chipotle and qdoba. Chipotle being my favorite. Qdoba is just so bland to me... not sure why. Maybe because im not one for their tasty cheese sauce that most people enjoy.

One down side to hot heads is that they have far more options than other burrito joints. 12 sauces? Chicken or SPICY chicken? Peppers? Its a bit overwhelming to a new customer. But they do have some good deals. On mondays they have a 2 burrito deal for like $10-11... and you get a free cookie with each entree!

Free cookie mondays FTW!!!

Anyways, im full, so im probably going to go pass out now... which is really bad because im at work."}
{"text":"Their sauces are brilliant. Try the combination of sweet habanero and hot head sauce. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced. All the good things like guacamole cost a lot extra. They rush you just like Subway only  worse. Will not go back. Food not good. Service not good."}
{"text":"I'm sad to lower my rating. The food is great, service great but what is going on with the portions. The servings of meat at the Strongsville location use to be generous (don't know if they still are since I switched to the Brunswick location.) At Brunswick location they measure the meat serving with what looks like a medicine cup. You want more meat than that? Just pay more. I don't know if it is a chain wide change or just local but it's bad enough that I won't return again. I'm going back to Chipotle."}
{"text":"I heard that this place was good went in and there are supposed to be all these great options. I ordered two different burritos and tried all their sauces. Food was lackluster sauces had no flavor and no heat was let down will not be returning"}
{"text":"Let me first say they weigh their tortilla chips for the nachos that they charge $8 for. Who does that!!!! It's chips!!!! They're cheap! So we ordered nachos and a burrito, once I saw them pull out the tiniest bag of pre weighed chips I knew it was going downhill from there. We ordered the barbacoa burrito and they ran out of the meat while making it, so we asked them to just add steak to it....\"same price\" ...well that was ignored and the half filled burrito was sent down the line to the toppings!! There is no way we were paying for that crap! This is why you lose customers! We've tried this place twice and never again."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, nice staff, liberal coupons. Much more options and variety versus Chipotle and Qdoba. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love this place they have the best food and excellent Customer Service. I go there a lot because my job is down the street. When I walk in the door the owner greets me by name every time he say hello Tracy :-)  the staff is so friendly and welcoming. I never have to wait for my food they are fast and the food portions are wonderful. Since I've been going to hot heads I haven't been back to chipotle. They also have  perks such as a punch card once you fill it up you can get a free burrito or bowl. Also on Sundays you can get 2 meals for a special price. I love love their chicken its so good better than chipotle. So if you want great customer service great food speedy service  you should try hot heads you won't be disappointed. Oh and also as I mentioned I work down the street from hot heads and everyone in my office goes there we call and place our orders and its ready when we go to pick it up and what makes it more special is that they write on the container \"Have a great day\" with a smiley face that's just a nice touch that this owner does to ensure great customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Not only is the food good, the Brothers running the show are awesome! Chipotle...BYE.
At chipotle, the employees seem to have their own menu going on. Like..who's on first?? I always and all of you as well have to say \"can I have a little bit more\"
Not at this place. My family has had burritos and bowls, so awesome. Better yet, they have a rewards card and they are in the Entertainment book. You can order that on line. Keep up the good work!
Robin Livingston"}
{"text":"I liked it better than chipotle! More veggies to load up and tons of sauces to choose from! Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the barbacoa burrito and it was just ok. It had flavor, but it was not all that great. They were stingy with the salsa, and charge $1 extra to have onions and green peppers added to your food. The burrito shells they use are too small for the ingredients. You'd be better off at either Chipotle or Baha Fresh. My burrito was also cold and coming apart. I definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great, however because of employee concerns I did not give a 5 star rating. Some employees are sweet and professional, while others don't even respond to your questions!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time and I sadly must take a star away after a steady decline in service over the past year.  Still just ok, probably better than Qdoba or Sh!tpudd!e, but Hotheads service used to put them WAY above the others, and that is so important to me.

If the owner or manager is not on duty, the service from the crew goes down sharply and predictably.   I'll just walk out next time they are not present.

Things like: waiting minutes to be acknowledged, then just standing in silence instead of saying \"Hi, can I take your order\", mumbling, goofing with coworkers while I repeat my order.  Being treated like I'm a bother.  Done with that.

Still ok otherwise and I'll go back, but descent service is crucial. I like the food but I'll take it without the apathy and attitude.

This Duke is offering his crown to the next taker.  It's yours."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical of new food places, but now I know I had nothing to worry about with this one. The place is very clean and welcoming. I got a pork bowl which was very good. Their meat is juicy and fresh, which is my favorite part about it. In comparison, it's very similar to chipotle but the quality of Hot Head's meat is definitely better. Great place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible, tasteless and not what was ordered. Bland except for the sauces. Pico was tomato with a few pieces of onion and out of entire little singular container there was only one tiny speck of possible cilantro or parsley. So little taste to it really couldn't tell. Nacho cheese was blah, tasteless white sauce. I ordered a burrito with chicken, lettuce, cheese, sour cream and pico with Buffalo sauce. What I got was a lot of rice, a few beans and a few tiny squares of tasteless beef! Absolutely not one shred of lettuce or cheese to be found, rip off in full. A small container with Buffalo sauce and one with liquid sour cream sauce was put in the sack with the burrito. My husband asked for a steak burrito with everything except jalapeño. At least he got the correct meat, but no cheese or lettuce in it. Apparently the order before ours had the opposite issue as the woman was screaming at the worker behind the counter that she \"said no lettuce\" why did they put a handful of it in her burrito. Apparently the made to order and add what you want is a come on, not something they actually do. Good thing we had buy one get one coupons, but even half price was too much for this."}
{"text":"Holy burrito!!! Went here because it was highly recommended. Now I get why! Very friendly staff. I got the burrito with pork barbacoa & added hothead sauce & queso. Got a side of the sweet safe to try...yum. Unbelievable flavor! And the burritos are HUGE! I will TOTALLY be back! Soon, very soon!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! Chipotle has nothing on this place... The staff were very nice and helpful. The Barbacoa burrito was probably the best I've ever had with extra Hot Head sauce on it... I will definitely be back here next time I come out here"}
{"text":"Overall I thought Hotheads was pretty good. Got a spicy steak burrito bowl with guac, corn, black beans, brown rice and salsa roja. The meat wasn't gristly like you find at Chipotle. The service was outstanding....super friendly employees willing to take the time to explain the menu options, variety of different sauces and the rewards program. I will definately go back to try their chicken tacos. I am happy to have another food option in my area that isn't McDonald's, Subway or some other gross chain fast food establishment. Also it is nice to see businesses open in that complex that treat their guests like they appreciate them so give it a try...It's a totally decent spot."}
{"text":"The good: employee was friendly, knowledgeable on what was vegetarian, place was clean and new. The vegetarian burrito comes with free guacamole and veggies. 

The bad: I forgot to try any of their salsas so this might be my fault, but burrito seemed kind of plain. Also the veggies were heavily salted like another review mentioned.

The place is kind of like another chipotle, qdoba, etc"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Hot Head Burritos and was excited when it opened because it's in the shopping center on GV PKWY & Horizon Ridge with the Sprouts & Target I frequent; and I am always up for good Mexican food.  I was surprised to find the place empty when we came in for lunch at about 12:30 on a workday.  Never a good sign.  

A friend and I decided to share a barbacoa burrito and the taco meat (ground beef) nachos, but as we began to order an older gentleman walked in and we were told that they were going to quickly make his order before ours.  This was bizarre, but he seemed to be a friend of the franchise owner.  Still a terrible business practice.  

Once we did order, I immediately regretted the nacho choice.  They layer the chips in a Styrofoam container and add the toppings, including shredded cheese.  They top it with melted queso, but that is not enough to melt the shredded cheese or warm any of the other toppings.  You are left with a cold congealed mess that is not appetizing.  They have no way to heat the nachos, so this is not something that can be changed.  Our burrito was okay, but nothing special (heavy on the rice) and I was a little peeved that fajita veggies were a $2 up charge.
  
I may give it a second chance, but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"If you are thinking this is Chipotle, you'd be wrong. I know that it's the same concept, but the flavors and tastes are different. They have many sauces to choose from and two kinds of veggies. 

I thought I would be hugely disappointed but to my surprise it was the opposite!!! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is fresh healthy and delicious and the staff is really nice. I've quickly become a regular and will be back for more! Better than Chipotle in my opinion

EDIT - 9/2/17 - This place had a falling out between partners and the on-site manager who kept it running tiptop and clean is no longer there meaning only high school kids are standing between you and getting sick. Food is not cooked temperature no longer be coming here..."}

{"text":"I have tried many burrito places but for some reason I keep going back to Chipotle... However... Hot Head Burritos is REALLY GOOD!! The taste of the burrito was awesome! They have more selection than Chipotle:

You can get a large (or small) burrito shell, they have jalapenos or banana peppers you can add, better hot sauces, etc.

Give this place a try. I am a fan for sure!!"}
{"text":"Before I took the time to write my own review, I was shocked upon reading some of the negativity people had to say. My boyfriend and I have had our eye on this place since it opened and heard from a friend how awesome it was. We decided to try it out. We were a little hesitant since we got there 5 minutes before closing (I'm normally not one to do that however I was starving) and we were immediately greeted by several smiles and awesome service. Being new they took the time to explain everything and to recommend their favorites. I opted for the barbacoa burrito and it was delicious. Everything tastes super fresh, the burrito was huge, and the couple sauces I tried were amazing. I would and will definitely be returning here to try more of what they have!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying hot head burritos for the first time today, and it was amazing! I was in town from San Diego and have been wanting to try this place. The owners of this store were so cordial and welcoming and are great people! I brought home a couple burritos and a burrito bowl for my family. My dad asked for seconds on the spicy chicken bowl and my sister is in love with the vegetarian tacos!! She said they were \"even better than chipotle\". Can't wait to go back for some Mexican food cravings."}
{"text":"So excited that HotHead just opened in Southern Highlands. Love the food here. I always get the burrito and in my opinion ranks up there with the best of them.  The place is really clean and the staff is very friendly, always greeting me when I come in.  I will def be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time today. I was welcomed and greeted very warmly. Upon entering the man standing behind the counter (the manager or owner) asked me off his was my first time in, I responded yes and he walked me thru the process. Asked me if I wanted to sample anything to just let him know. The first thing he did, was turn around to wash his hands and place gloves on before handling anything. Which I greatly appreciated. My boyfriend is very picky, he only likes meats in his tacos, so ordering all 4 meats (steak, chicken, barbacoa, and carnitas) with no rice/beans or toppings is usually confusing for most places we go to. But he approached it very open minded and didn't question what I was ordering, which was a nice change. I ordered a chicken and steak burrito bowl for myself which was very flavorful and is a large portion (next time I'll go for a lil bowl). But we are both satisfied with our new find and will definitely be coming back soon, I want to try new mixes and sauces!"}
{"text":"I'm giving hot heads burrito one more star. After my first couple experiences I wasn't impressed but I've got my order down now. The bowl is much better than the burrito and hot head sauce is awesome. If I want something different than my go to burrito spot I come here and sometimes I really crave it. Almost evey burrito place I've tried I hated at first so I'm not surprised I started to like this place."}
{"text":"Good food, atmosphere is nice. Try the Sweet Habanero sauce on whatever you try. I always request extra meat. You can have them grill your burrito too which will melt the cheese and get everything hot for you. One bowl usually equals two meals for me. Also can request cilantro if you want some. Replaces Chipolte because of the sauce additions!"}
{"text":"I've seen several H H B places around town and never tried it until tonight. 

Walked in hour before closing and store was empty, main dining area looked very clean and I was promptly greeted by a friendly employee. 

Menu is similar to Chipotle/Cafe Rio. Cafe Rio is disgusting btw! Employee was friendly and explained ordering procedures since it was my first visit at H H B. 

I like my salad or burrito clean - filled with protein, grilled vegetables, tomato salsa & corn salsa. Normally I order salad version but craved a burrito tonight. Burrito is HUGE! Great value for the amount of food. It taste a little saltier than expected. Not sure if it's grilled vegetables or corn salsa - (3) stars rating. 

Great location inside Target shopping center."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure why there are so many negative reviews here. I've always had a good experience at Hot Head. 

The food is super tasty and a nice change of pace from Chipotle. If the debate is over which is better, I'd go for Hot Head. Chipotle is good of course, but it kind of always tastes the same. Hot Head offers such a variety of sauces and a slightly wider selection of toppings, it's nice that I can try different things. I especially like how there are so many ways to spice up your burrito or bowl. 

Definitely check out the Facebook fan page before you go - they have different specials for $1 off or free chips, etc if you mention the Facebook post. Plus they have a \"Free Stuff Card\" that's handy if you're a frequent visitor - you accumulate stickers to eventually get free things."}
{"text":"So wanted to love this place since eating at Chipotle seems scary now... 

First off, convenient location by the Green Valley Target, the interior is decorated cheery and bright, and staff was ultra friendly. 

But, the food was just okay. The chicken had a greasy, oiliness to it. It's diced similar to chipotle, but like I said, was oddly oily. The guac was also not as appealing as chipotle (pre- e-Coli outbreak).  Prices are comparable to Chipotle. 

The owner or manager was very nice, let me sample a couple sauces, they offer a good variety  ranging from mild, buffalo, cholula, to extreme hot. 

There's about 20 tables and the place was dead when we arrived, yet half the tables were dirty; if 2-3 people are standing around in the back, someone needs to be wiping those tables up front. 

I would consider trying it again, the friendly smiles and location added a star or two."}
{"text":"I love Hot Heads! The food is always fresh and the line moves quickly. I usually get a bowl with chicken but last time I ordered the shrimp and it was really good!"}
{"text":"This is an update.  After posting my review I was contacted by one of the owners, apologizing about my disappointment and invited me back for a 2nd chance.  He explained that being a new business, they were still striving to become great.  That apology in itself showed me how much this business cares about pleasing their customers.  Heads up for Hothead."}
{"text":"Went and tried it. Food was good, but they overcharged me. I called to try and talk to someone and only got an answering machine. Left a message and never got a return phone call. There are too many good places to eat in Vegas, I won't return"}
{"text":"Not as advertised, bad service and poor food preparation.

Not as advertised:

1)No barbacoa at all or spicy chicken -- \"we dont have any. they havent sent us any yet\" which I find as a pretty weird response 
2) Make it a Meal Deal!-- \" we dont sell cookies\" well, I hate to break it to you, your website clearly advertises \"Make it a Meal Deal!\" and that includes a medium drink and \"three delicious chocolate chip cookies\"    

I usually dont mind if they were just simply out of something but to be dismissive and condescending is what stood out and ultimately compelled me to write this review.

Bad service: 

1) I had to repeat my order 6 times to the line preps and 2 times to the bag guy and cashier. Every other place that has this style of ordering/prep usually handles communication to each other as the food is prepared. 

Poor Food preparation: 
2) Very sloppy, both orders were just hastily put together. the prep took giant handfuls of each ingredient and haphazardly threw it all over my flour tortillas 

Bottom line: if you enjoy eating at a sub par, overpriced chipotle this is your place."}
{"text":"Never going back , the food sucks. If you want to compete with the big boys. You need to be better  then the big boys."}
{"text":"Meh. Kind of generic. Service was, however, fast, informative, and friendly. All the ingredients were fresh, aside from pico de gallo and corn salsa, but they really lacked flavor. The pico was waterlogged and lacking cilantro, while the corn relish was full of cheap frozen corn that was overcooked with no taste to the salsa or existence of other ingredients. It's \"shrimp season\" so the shrimp is a choice ingredient for tacos, burritos, bowls, etc. but it's TINY shrimp (one step above salad shrimp) and they are also lacking in flavor or seasoning. With all this being said, Hothead does offer about 10 sauces to squirt on your taco, burrito, bowl, etc. but they don't make up for the lack of taste in everything else. The chips that accompany a meal are stale, generic, and heavily salted. They are definitely bulk chips and not house-made. I probably would visit one more time for a second chance but not a huge fan just yet."}
{"text":"This place is good. Not amazing and off the chart. It's good enough to grab and eat if your too lazy to cook or just need something to eat because your starving. I think it's one notch below chipotle, but not horrible. I would totally come back. I like the fact that they have a \"lil bowl\" size because it's the perfect size for me. I'd definitely come back. It's convenient for me."}
{"text":"My visits were always met with delicious outcome. Love the QUESO on everything! Hothead sauce also made everything better. Sadly, now they are closed/gone. I wonder what happened...

(Update: I did reach out to them via their website, to see what happened and/or if they ever had plans to try again with Vegas somehow. Sadly I did not get a response)"}
{"text":"great!! loved it had a big salad with lots of Barbacoa
good customer service too..very nice"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and friendly. The food however is nothing special. My brother in law got the nachos with the taco meat which he said was bland. The queso and other sauces he had weren't very flavorful either. I had the burrito with chicken. It was pretty bland also. The food wasn't bad but it just wasn't anything really good. The nachos were small and were over $7.00 and while my burrito was big, I'd rather go across the street to robertos and have more flavor. We're glad we tried it but probably won't be going back just because we can get better for cheaper."}
{"text":"Outstanding burritos! Good quality meats and killer hot sauces!!! Subway was packed so we gave this a try and just loved how clean and friendly it was. The food was so delicious. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Hot Head we leave satisfied by the delicious food and especially friendly service. The staff is very welcoming and the food is extremely affordable. We joined the rewards program and get discounts on future purchases. And we love that they love football! We recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!! This is great Mexican food . Fast and great pricing. Friendly service 
My family loves this place!!"}
{"text":"Not only was my nachos order ridiculously overpriced for the portion I got, the chips were stale, chicken was horrible, and guac tasted like chalk. Everyone who works in there seemed high or extremely slow. Never again"}
{"text":"Imitation chipotle and qdoba. Only difference is portion sizes are smaller and the fact that they have different sauces you can add on at the end. If you are going to copy off another company at least add a unique touch that outdoes the other place."}
{"text":"I'll always welcome another burrito spot near home, especially when it's conveniently located near Target.

One of the best parts of this place is that they have a nutrition calculator on the website. It is easy to use and I was able to play around with options to find something that wouldn't blow my day. They also offer smaller size options like the lil' burrito and the lil' bowl. 

I had the Lil' Bowl with steak, rice, black beans, guacamole, Monterey jack, salsas, and taco sauce. It was a decent little bowl and came in around 400 calories. My husband had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Burrito and loved it. 

The restaurant was clean when we visited for lunch on Sunday. The pricing is in line with what similar restaurants charge. 

The only thing I did notice here was that the staff could be a little more welcoming. The man that helped us (and looked like an owner) never smiled and either did the young girl working that day. They might be still training as well because the girl kept asking what everything was, what was verde and what was Monterrey Jack. Not a huge deal, but usually new businesses are overly welcoming and thankful for customers so this surprised me a bit."}
{"text":"I used to go here plenty of times with my wife when we lived in the area but since the owner isn't there much,the kids he hired to run the place goof around,short you on your portions and tend to screw up your order because they are having a conversation with the other workers instead of paying attention to what you are asking for.

I don't live in the area anymore but when I'm in the area I try to avoid it knowing the food isn't as good as it once was."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to get a burrito. I am in love with this place. I even think it's better than Chipotle. So many options and the queso is bomb. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I will never return to this establishment. The staff left me with such a sour taste in my mouth. And the worst part? I feel as if the manager was present and included in the bunch. I asked for a little bowl, I got a big bowl. I asked for black beans, I got pinto. I asked for half pork and chicken on my what was supposed to be a little bowl, I got DOUBLE chicken and pork. And might I add the chicken is mixed with dark meat and the pork is absolutely flavorless. Very disappointed, was looking forward to the opening of this place."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food, nice environment and always real quick service. Thank you for choosing Southern Highlands Community!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I can tell you I am a repeat customer and have turned several people on to this place. It's like chipotle but wayyyy better. The portions are great. The items you can put in the burrito are quality. I've tried the ground beef, chicken and steak. My favorite is spicy steak and they have queso sauce who doesn't love queso. Let's not forget to try the hot head sauce. This place is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out since it was on the way home and I havent had it before. It's literally like Chipotle... but better! The sauces they let me try were so good and flavorful! Not the mention the excellent customer service. I will definitely be returning:)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here soooooo, here's my thoughts. I did peruse the menu a couple nights ago and should have stuck with plan to eat \"bowl.\" The veggie burrito was as big as my head and I don't think I even made it to the halfway mark. And if you know anything about Burritos,  it's not like I can eat it again later on it'll be a soggy mess. It was absolutely delicious. In the future I would either split it with a friend or get a bowl. I use the habanero sauce and it was Muy caliente as expected. Definately recommend this joint. Be ready to make a lot of decisions though.. But that's a good thing!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken bowl, chicken burrito, and chips. I would say mediocre at best. I specifically asked if it was chicken breast and was told it was. When we got home, our food was cold and it was dark meat chicken. I should have taken a picture of the bag of chips that were 2 dollars. They were in the size of a small baggie and tasted like stale Tostitos. Luckily I had some fresh Tostitos at home that we were able to eat. I know they just opened, but not sure if we will go back. The staff was friendly, but the food just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre . Everything from the food to the service. First time here and I let the girl at the counter know. Wasn't very helpful at all and not interested in giving me recommendations. The portions are decent but the food and meat are very BLAND . Not a lot of flavor and just not good. After a couple of bites it actually started making me feel very sick. The three people working didn't seem excited or happy to be there at all. 

All in all this is just another chipotle type establishment . Nothing special about it. I'd rather make the extra trip to zabbas. For better customer service and food. Sad because this is so close to home."}
{"text":"It's very good but bland and you have to add the sauces.maybe the glitches aren't out yet"}
{"text":"I can't quite put my finger on it, but I really just prefer this place over Chipotle. The food just seems.......fresher? The beans aren't all soggy and half smooshed, the guacamole isn't 50% gargantuan chunks of onion, and you have more options overall. They also seem to give much larger portions (also consistently sized) in general. I've ordered the same bowl from Chipotle in excess of 40 times and the damn thing looks different EVERY FRIGGEN TIME. I don't get it. 

I ordered the shrimp bowl, and I guess the shrimp is a seasonal thing, but it was certainly delicious. They cooked the shrimp right on the spot for my order! FRESH! 

I just like knowing what I'm getting. And enjoying the fact that it's fresh and well prepared. This place just does a better job of that, in my opinion. 

Also, TONS AND TONS of sauce choices. Tons. And almost all are delicious. Although that's a totally subjective thing."}
{"text":"So I really liked this place, then I had a bad experience... tonight I was in with my son, we normally visit this location 2x a week... there was 3 people in line including me, so the girl making the burrito started hurrying and slopping everything on the burrito very carelessly. I got to the register to pay and before I could get my wallet put away the owner was telling me I needed to move to the other side of the counter so he could help the customer behind me. I found this to be a very odd comment and it just struck me as rude. I told the manager there was no need to be rude, as I grabbed my food from the other side of the counter. I said this quietly as to not alert the other guests or make a scene. Then he decided to loudly say \"excuse me?\" In a very rude tone, once again and then said \"he didn't think he was being rude\"... I walked away with my food. I expected him to come to the table afterwards and apologize... yet he ignored me and then quickly left the store. The poor girl working there felt so bad that she brought a coupon to the table and apologized for him. The 17yr old girl had more tact then the owner of the business. Regardless of wether or not you thought you were being rude sir, you should still offer up and apology to a customer that frequents your establishment. I can assure you that I won't be back to your location, and I'm sure the people behind me that we're trying it for the first time probably won't be back either. Your retort was rude enough to get a gasp from the woman behind me.... not good business."}
{"text":"Bad, just bad.. I had a spicy chicken burrito from this place at 8pm, it's now 5:14am and I'm still puking up cilantro and beans (sorry for the graphic description). Service was slow, food was cold, food made me sick, chips were salty.. Need I say more? 1 star because the staff was courteous, but that's about it. I won't be visiting ever again."}
{"text":"Now exit 28 has a franchise Mexican place kind of like Moe's or Qdoba (in addition to the already existing Taco Bell).  Newly-opened Hot Head Burritos is in the Stein Mart/Fresh Market shopping center, near Jersey Mike's.  

They have the usual tacos, burritos, \"bowls\", etc -- you can check out their menu on their website.  They did have an option of brown rice, which seems nice.   I guess the \"gimmick\" here would be that, besides salsas verde and roja (and corn, and pico de gallo), they have a dozen or so different sauces in plastic squirt bottles (I stuck with just the green salsa).  A small burrito was plenty big enough for me; added tortilla chips (which came in a small plastic bag; not sure why) and a drink (Pepsi products, plus Cheerwine) for a couple dollars more.  It was ok."}
{"text":"This is my 6th visit and I have never been disappointed! Great customer service, spotless kitchen and dining area, and the food tastes great!

My favorite is a bowl with barbacoa, brown rice, black beans, medium salsa, corn and pico, hot head sauce and mozzarella cheese. Nice spice but not to hot for my taste."}
{"text":"Good chicken burrito, they will build it any way you like. I witnessed a number of creative combinations being made, one in a bowl rather than a tortilla. Friendly staff. Nice to have this restaurant in our neighborhood. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Watch out chipotle!  Very good experience. Clean and friendly staff. Burritos were gooey and great!"}
{"text":"It was another Chipotle-like burrito place, with the addition of sauces to add in the burritos. Good, but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Mmmm this place has good food, however I don't know exactly how to feel. 

First off, we pulled up and the lady must have seen us coming cause she hurried to the front. As soon as we walked in she said hello. Hi! \"Have you been here before?\" Before we eve passed the first set of tables she was telling us how it worked and the door barely shut. And I thought I talk fast but she beat me in that. I'm all for great customer service, but let me get in the door. 

This place is basically like the other place where you choose burrito or bowl and choose what you want in it. My mom and I ordered shrimp burrito and bowl. While that was cooking up, we told her what we want and down the line we went. When the shrimp was done, I don't know if the food was too cool for the tortilla, but she got a new one and poured all of the contents onto it and rolled it again. ?? 

When we got home we were ready to chow down only to bite into the saltiest shrimp! Omgoodness I thought it was a fresh catch from the ocean. It was saltier than my attitude. I still ate it because it cost money, and I don't like to throw away food, but it was not easy to get through. It wasn't just me, my mom felt the same way and made the same face before I said anything. 

I'm sure this is just a one time thing. Hoping it is. With the salty shrimp and jumping on me as soon as I walk through the door, I'm willing to give this place another shot. But only with the coupon I got in the mail."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was great from the burritos to chicken bowls! Perfect place for a quick and fresh meal! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am a vegan from out of state and  I went in to this magnificent restaurant. The place was clean and the young man that helped me gave me extraordinary service. He suggested a bowl of brown rice, black beans, grilled vegetables, and guacamole. The food was amazing and I am definitely coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Hot Head Burritos. I was so excited for this place to open but I was disappointed both times. The second time especially sealed the deal for me. I ordered a salad and watched the men in front of me get the largest amount of meat on a burrito I've ever seen. When it came time to put meat on my salad, I got almost nothing. The manager that was making my salad scraped the bottom of the container...yum. I could tell he knew it wasn't a correct portion but made no effort to offer me more or even ask me if I wanted different meat. Not to mention, the meat was ICE cold upon both my visits, which is funny because \"Hot\" is in their name.

Although the staff is friendly, they are poorly trained and do not maintain a clean work station. Messes on the food counter were being wiped up with paper napkins instead of properly cleaned before serving the next order.

You want a great burrito? Walk across the street to Roberto's. Half the price, equal portions, very clean, hot and tasty food.

Sorry Hot Head, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We live next to this restaurant and decided to try it. The restaurant is clean and inviting and the staff were friendly. It has the feeling of a chipotle. We purchased two pork barbacoa burritos. The burritos unfortunately lacked flavor. The tortillas were very plain tasting, especially compared to the other places in town (eg, Faustos, Cafe Rio). The meat also lacked the flavor usually associated with pork barbacoa. The burritos were pretty large though. If you enjoy very Americanized \"Mexican\" food (I wouldn't call this Mexican food though) and are in the area, it's worth stopping and trying."}
{"text":"This place was super good! Needed a burrito place in southern highlands finally. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great staff, and most importantly, delicious food! Very fresh, lots of options, MUCH better than their competition.  Been open less than a week, and I've already been in twice!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burrito place. Sooooo many more options than Chipotle! From taco meat, to queso, to crushed chips, pineapple and more! And their sauces? Amazing! They add so much to the actual burrito! I go with hothead sauce (tangy garlic) and sweet habanero. Oh and their cookies I swear are baked with crack! Soft, sweet, delicious, and you can't eat just one!"}
{"text":"I never heard of this place until I was working an event in Southern Highlands. I was referred by a colleague from the east coast saying that it was better than Chipotle. Supposedly they are the only Hot Head Burritos on the west coast. I decided to give it a try for lunch, and I was BLOWN away! The burrito felt like heaven in my mouth, and the sweet habanero sauce to top it off was AMAZING! If you are going to come to this place, which I HIGHLY recommend you do, then make sure you try their sauces. This is what they are known for. 

The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about everything. The manager was really cool too. The actual sitting area was small, but they said that they are going to be opening up 2 more locations in south Las Vegas soon. Give them a try, and find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating here when it opened...  Wasn't impressed from the time I walked in. I felt like I was looking at chipotle with a makeover, staff was dull and when I got home the food wasn't impressive either, brown rice was so hard it crunches, put very little meat so paid extra for double which still seemed like very little.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Ate here and we won't be back. First off what a dumb way they have the line arranged, the line should come in from the left and \"move\" along the counter. If this place was busy (which it was dead when we went) it would be a nightmare to navigate that line and checkout mess.  They should get money back from who ever designed that store. The burritos were tiny, gave us a small scoop of beans small scoop of rice that she scraped from the bottom of the container, topped it with some meat and pico/lettuce but it just was nothing to come back for. My 9 year old told me he was going to need two burritos because they were tiny. Would rather go to cafe rio or chipotle or the other numerous Mexican joints around town where you actually get a decent portion for your money.  I will be Shocked if this place lasts another year!"}
{"text":"So I am going to start this review by saying that I am S-T-U-F-F-E-D. I got a bowl with brown rice, spicy Baracoa (YUM) Pinto beans, sour crème, monetary jack cheese, guac(duh) and the \"Hot Head\" sauce to go on top. My fiancé and I got home and immediately dug into our meals.... He got a burrito, which was huge! 

The food, was SUPER good. As soon as we walked in, Mike and a young woman gave us the option of trying our meat before \"making any commitments\" I am so happy they allowed us to do this! I tried the spicy steak, which was really good, of course I opted for the Baracoa, but they were both super good. The guacamole was thick and perfect- I love guac, so that may be biased, but let me tell you what.... IT WAS GOOD! The \"Hot Head\" sauce is like a thicker cream sauce that has a little bit of a kick to it with some great garlic flavor- loved it! 

The service we experienced at this location was absolutely PHENOMENAL! When it comes to having a lot of options, I can be very indecisive, but they were both super patient with us, and I APPRECIATE THAT! 

The atmosphere of this new little establishment was seriously, SO CUTE. It's new, hip, and looks super inviting.  Did I mention it was so cute?!

I am definitely going to be going back to give them a second, third, fourth, and fifth round! 

Thanks again Hot Head Burritos! You were both rock stars tonight, and we loved the food!

PS. My cat did too, I just caught her eating my left overs I was planning on going back to!! :))"}
{"text":"No other place offers better sauces or options!   Always fast service!  Blows chipotle or whatever away!!!!!  Recommend their straight habanero sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was actually really good. I hate chipotle but Hot Head totally blew them out of the water in sauce variety, tender meat, and more!

We were greeted by a few gentleman and I presume the business owner. I came in with my co workers around 12:30 today and I got the most delicious chicken bowl (keep in mind I hardly ever eat meat) the process was absolutely painless and I was in and out in about five minutes. They packed my stuff to go because I'm a dainty eater so I get to definitely save some for later. 

I will be coming back and this will be my new lunch spot. Clean, quality food, and great prices. Thanks hot head! :)"}
{"text":"They greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The girl asked me if it was my first time there.  And yes it was. (she was kind of a fast talker)  I felt like I was being rushed, but I was the only one there.  It reminded me of a Chipolte/Cafe Rio.  She ask me if I would like to sample a couple of meats?  So I tried the chicken and the steak.  The steak was kind of tuff, so I did the chicken.  I went through the process of ordering.  It was ok, not anything I would drive out of my way for.  But it was ok."}
{"text":"I will give it 5 stars and I enjoyed my bowl with their tangy habanero sauce very much. I had the steak bowl. Today I had chipotle of which I had not visited in quite some time with the recent issues. Hothead is way better and about the same cost. So that is my comparison test. I will be going to hothead."}
{"text":"This place is a mix of Chipotle and Roberto's. The staff is friendly and has a great attitude. My wife ordered a pork quesadilla, and I ordered steak nachos. The nachos were just ok. I will not order the nachos again. However, the pork quesadillas were very tasty and seem to be the thing to order."}
{"text":"The food was cold before it got home, and I live right across the street. The ingredients are subpar, we had the taco meat, chicken, and spicy steak in a combination of tacos and burritos. They were rude, trying to be like chipotle I guess. 20+ dollars for 2 tacos and 2 burritos, save that money and get the exact same thing at del taco across the street."}
{"text":"Went to Hot Head Burritos again!!!!  What awesome service and amazing  food!!! Highly recommend this place! They greet you with a smile and how are you when you come in and a thank you for coming when you leave! The best!!!!!! Thank you for making our day ...again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place for a few weeks now and today my dreams came true! Basically if Chipotle and Cafe Rio had a baby it would be Hot Head Burritos. 

American-Mexican assembly line style ordering so you can get exactly what you want. High quality, fresh proteins and veggies with lots of toppings and sauces to try! I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch burrito and it was very good! I also fell in love with their extreme habanero sauce- oh man it was so freakin' good!

Love seeing another healthy, quick and affordable place pop up in Henderson! If you're in the area, it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite; there aren't too many super close options for Southern Highlands and Mountain's Edge residents. This is a chipotle style spot with burritos, bowls, tacos, quesadillas, etc. I've gotten a steak quesadilla twice and added other items to it (black beans, pico) - overall pretty solid. The staff members are really nice and always make it a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Hothead sauce is delicious! Burritos and atmosphere feels like chipotle but the staff is much friendlier and the entire array of Sauces are tasty"}
{"text":"Second trip to this location. I really like Hot Head. The dining area is immaculate and the service is friendly and fast.  

I ordered a chicken burrito. I wanted the fajita veggies, but they were out.  The gentleman quickly offered to make me some fresh veggies. I declined (because I was hungry and too impatient to wait, but I truly appreciate the offer). I noticed other reviews of this place say there was an uncharged for the fajita veggies, but I've never been charged for that at this or any other location. 

The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is the rice.  The rice needs to be cooked just slightly longer as about half of the rice in my burrito was crunchy and under cooked.  I know rice dries a little as it sits in the warm container, but I also know the difference between a little dry and under cooked and this was the latter. 

Probably just caught them on a off day.  Still really enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars! The meat looks and taste awful! The rice & beans had no flavor. This place seriously sucks, don't come & spend your money here!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the staff here was amazing and super helpful. I stopped in for take out lunch on a Friday afternoon and there was only one person eating in. That's not usually a good sign for me. 

I had a bowl with brown rice, black beans,spicy chicken, pico, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. Clearly, I had a lot of flavors going on! I got home, ready to dive in...it was blah. Not bad, just blah. The rice had no flavor. The chicken would have been awful without me adding the spicy sauce. 

This place has great potential, if they can up the flavor factor. I'd be willing to try it again in a few months."}
{"text":"I wanted to avoid the Chipotle lunch rush so I decided to try this place almost right behind it. It looked so empty and barely put together when I went in. Service was fine and everyone was really friendly. Food was mediocre at best. Next time I'll wait in line at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I had my second Hot Heads experience today. It was take out. The first time was dine in. Both were delicious. I don't want to throw around the five star review carelessly, but I was very pleased with every aspect of my visits. The staff is very nice. The restaurant is clean (brand new building, so I would hope so). The food is fresh and delicious. 
I have gotten the bowl with taco meat. It's the same premise as Chipotle, except Chipotle doesn't have taco meat. They are missing out. They have what seems to be slightly more topping selections too, but what stands out the most to me is the freshness of the veggies and such. Perhaps most importantly, there aren't whole sprigs of parsley in the rice!!!! Yay! 
I recommend the hot heads sauce. It's spicy and wonderful. I asked the second time for extra sauce. Do it. Live large."}
{"text":"I've been to Hot Head twice now with co-workers.  We attended for lunch on both occasions.  Hot Head is similar to Chipotle in that you select your entree (tacos, burrito, or bowl) and they build it for you.  I chose a chicken bowl, which only had one flame by it, indicating that it was mildly spicy.  However, I could have chosen spicy chicken, which had another flame or two.  I usually get brown rice, black beans, lettuce, sour cream, and medium salsa.  By doing this, I can make an apples to apples comparison to Chipotle.

You don't get nearly as much meat at Hot Head as you do at Chipotle.  There was a background flavor in the dish that you might describe as sweet.  I think it was the sauce that they mixed with the chicken.  I found it tasty, but my three friends found it annoying.  Despite receiving less chicken, the dish was still a large portion and very filling.  The quality of the food is good, but I love those big chunks of chicken that Chipotle gives me.  

I also love that you have your choice of 12 sauces to top your entree with.  Some of them can be a bit spicy as they are based with habanero peppers!

The service is much faster than Chipotle because there weren't 20 people standing in front of me in line.  Chipotle has that cool application that I have installed on my smart phone that lets me order ahead, so I rarely wait in line anyway.

I'd recommend this place, but it's just shy of Chipotle's taste, quantity, and quality."}
{"text":"Good place. Unfortunately, I went to get food on Wednesday night,10/04/2017, and the worker told me they were closing the doors for good that very next day, 10/05/17."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted by everyone who was working in the store. The menu is very easy to read and to order off of. I had the chicken in my burrito and it was delicous! There are many different  options when it comes to fillings for your burrito/bowl. They also have 10 different sauces you can choose from, from mild to straight habanero. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the burritos were tasty and huge, the cost was about average for that type of place. All in all I can say it's definitely worth a try, and I'll definitely be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I came in with zero expectations. I had never heard of them or anyone who has tried them.

When I walk in the door I'm greeted by the best damn staff on the planet. Super friendly, extremely attentive. Jonathan even gave me great sauce combos to try. Hands down the 4 star rating comes from the amazing staff.

Now to the food. It was missing flavor. Rice, meat, even the beans.. All devoid of flavor. Had I not tried a small amount of the special sauces that Jonathan packed in small cups I would have totally been upset. 

With cafe rio just down the road this place might not see much of my business without an uptick in the flavors."}
{"text":"The service and the cleanliness were good. I had a tough time enjoying my tacos because while I watched them prepare my food, I noticed the amount of meat that was put into each taco. It was tiny. The flavors were bland and nothing resembled authenticity. I can understand that it isn't your typical Mexican joint - this is Henderson after all, but either make it your own and original or stick to the rules. And it was neither."}
{"text":"Hot Head Burritos is to burritos what Firehouse Subs is to subs sandwichs.  No, I do not mean they have wet burritos here.  I mean they have a lot of different types of hot sauce.  Maybe a few less than a Firehouse Subs would have...but still a wide variety.

Atmosphere - Red, Black, and White (reminds me of Firehouse Subs less the fireman paraphernalia),  stand alone tables and chairs, window seating, traditional Chipotle/Qdoba/Moe's style ordering process.

Service - Prompt, friendly, confused (this was their 2nd day open...so confusion was understandable)

Food - I got a burrito and a bowl to go on this visit.  HHB has some nice choices that include two rices (brown or white), two beans (pinto or black), six proteins (chicken, steak, pork, taco meat, barbacoa, and vegetarian).  All the proteins listed, also come in a spicy variant too.  They have 13 choices of hot sauce for which you can decide for yourself which one is unlucky #13.  

I ended up ordering a chicken burrito and a barbacoa bowl.  The chicken was standard fair while the barbacoa tasted to me like a spicy rump roast.  Something I have not had elsewhere...at least not from a burrito chain.  I kind of played it safe on the hot sauce and got the Louisiana Gold Red Pepper sauce.  It was hot without being so spicy as to ruin the other flavors in the meal.    

On a downside I do not remember if they had tortilla chips.  Nonetheless, I was not offered chips like at a Moe's or a Qdoba with my takeout order...minus a star there.

Overall -  I think I will place HHD in my rotation of burrito joints to visit.  Especially if I had a cold and wanted to warm things up a bit."}
{"text":"I love burritos and like to think i have developed a good taste for them. Hot Heads makes a pretty good one. I cant say as to the rest of their food but this place beats Chipotle and Qdoba. Chipotle is best for value and decent taste, Qdoba is right on the same page, but Hot Heads, while a dollar or two more expensive for the Burrito, is better. The burritos are good sized and meat portions are similar to both competitors. Honestly the best part of Hot Heads is their sauces. As advertised \"Mild to Wild\", alone the food is bland but thats why they have the sauces!!! I l LOVE the Hot Head sauce. Just ask for help with them if your to pansy to figure it out on your own, one of two owners is usually there."}
{"text":"Great spot I stumbled on today!  Had a tasty chicken burrito. And some of the best salsa and sauces I've had in a while.  I have to say they got chipotle beat. Will stop by whenever in LV. Can't wait til they come to LA."}
{"text":"Food is alright, but customer service was bad. We came in and the employees looked at us but didn't say hi or anything. When ordering, they barely put a small spoonful of ingredients, so we had to ask them to put more of almost everything and the employees looked very annoyed. Employees looked like they hated their jobs, they need to definitely improve on their customer service skills. Food and customer service is way better at chipotle."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very reasonable prices. Spicy steak and chicken are great. Staff is extremely friendly and always smiling. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. Brand new restaurant on green valley parkway. Great location easy in and out, super fast service with fresh ingredients that don't seem to be sitting in a warmer all day drying out."}
{"text":"A nice new addition to the Horizon Ridge/ Green Valley area. Food was pretty good, $2.20 for a bottle of Soda Pop is badly overpriced though."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and truly enjoy every time I am able to!  My favorite dish is the bowl. It's so delicious! The choices of meats, salsas, sauces and other toppings are vast and plentiful. Everything tastes so fresh and the meats are seasoned well. 

Delicious food, friendly staff,super clean restaurant and consistent quality. 
Most times the owners are hard at work, where if anywhere do you see that? 
SO awesome!
 There's never a long line here, so you don't have to wait a half hour like at Chipotle.
 If you haven't tried it, you really should give it a shot."}
{"text":"when I walked into Hot Heads I immediately thought of chipotle.  With the chipotle E. Coli outbreak ... could this place fulfill my chipotle needs ?  

The men at the register greeted me immediately, super friendly and excited.  You can tell the workers down the line were looking nervous and shy (which is normal for a new place, they'll be pros soon). It was quite packed when I came in and I felt a little rush to order, so what do you do?!  ... order what you would at chipotle and compare so this review is based solely on that.

The set up is similar, choose between burritos, bowls, tacos, or nachos and then add the ingredients you desire.  

Meat.  The steak was cold and overcooked.  Cooked too dry for me, but I'm a girl who enjoys steak done medium rare or medium.  My fiancé had the chicken and I would recommend that as the alternative.

Corn.  I love corn, so I ordered a extra side of corn.  I would prefer a little more flavor added, but it wasn't bad.  

Guacamole.  If you enjoy a smooth texture you may enjoy their guac.  It was a little too mushy for me.  

Overall ... I wasn't satisfied because of
flavor, however Hot Heads has a bunch of different sauces to add to your meal to kick it up so I need to test them out (like I said before, I was feeling rushed because of the line and the workers didn't really mention the sauces so I just ordered my burrito as if it was chipotle) 
Also they mention they will have \"different\" flavored tortillas soon.  What kinds ?  They weren't sure yet. 

Ok Hot Heads I gave you 3 stars because it was just ok, but I'm definitely coming back to try your \"mild 2 wild\" flavors ...
please don't let me down."}
{"text":"First of all, very friendly service. Second, I went in going to get the steak like I normally would at chipotle and going down the line I noticed there are a lot more options and sauces that chipotle does not have. I went to try and compare what I would usually get at chipotle and they offered to put any sauces on the side. I got sweet habanero and hot heads sauce and pineapple on the side bc it sounded very interesting. Initially, without any sauces the bowl had it's own unique flavor unlike chipotle. Their steak is not chewy like chipotle's is 75% of the time and their ingredients are very fresh. After adding the sauces and pineapples the bowl got 10x better. Overall, great service, clean restaurant and amazing food. Never going back to chipotle!!"}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis but this is getting ridiculous. Is this what you call a burrito? Even the cashier asked if it was a \"mini\". It's not! It's the size of a credit card. What a rip."}
{"text":"Pro: service stellar
Con: nachos WAY overpriced, and soggy, stale and just gross. Wanted money back. 

Flavor of salsa and queso good but so gross as soggy hot mess of nachos."}
{"text":"Really interesting to read some of the reviews... Kind of funny how everyone becomes a critic and judges a business (unfairly) based on one visit. 

I've been here a few times, the food is consistently good, the atmosphere is clean and it's definitely nice to have a fast food type of place in this area that doesn't consist of burgers and fries... 

I have to say, I was most impressed this evening. I went in just about 10/15 min before closing. I know it sucks when people show up right when you're ready to go home. I felt bad going in so late but hey, they're still open & I was starving! 

I was totally expecting the eye roll and sighing... Not at all the case. The guy who helped us (didn't get his name) was super friendly and gave me a couple of recommendations as I still haven't tried everything. I was really surprised by his positive attitude (sadly something you don't experience as often as you would expect) 

When you visit a business and your expectations are exceeded, that's more powerful than any advertising can buy. So as someone who's visited a hand full times- I can confidently say this is a well rounded, good place to eat!! Give it a try, the location is awesome too!!! 

Kudos to that employee who had a great attitude despite the fact they were about to close up! 

And so far the BBQ pork bowl with rice, corn and pico is my fav... But still have more combos to try out!! And their chips with cheese sauce -YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times in the past month and it has really grown on me. The food is good. A unique twist on Chipotle like establishments. Their menu of custom sauces make it so you can change up the taste in your order. I recommend Hot Head Sauce, which is a garlic based taco sauce. Of all the meats options, I prefer their chicken. Good flavor, marinaded, lean. I also like some of their meal deals. We get the family pack, which comes with two burritos, two kids meals, chips and drinks for all for $27. 

UPDATE: Returned on 7/22/17. Tried to order the \"Family Pack\" which we have ordered numerous times before. Item was posted on the menu for $27 as it has always been. Was promptly told by the employee that they have a new system and new ownership and that they had to ring everything separate instead of in the pack so the price would be higher. We protested that this was a posted item and price. We stated that they should tell the new owner they should change the sign. He said that he was sure they would eventually change it. After informing them that the last time we were there they had a new system and they still honored the price. After much protest we decided to leave, at which time they stated they would honor the price. We told them it was too late. I commented that this was why no one was in there and that's what they should tell the owner. We went across the street to Del Taco. It was delicious. Updated my review to two stars."}
{"text":"Food: 
*Lil' burrito chicken with brown rice, corn, salsa Fresca, mild salsa, lettuce and guacamole added for $1.00. It was ok, but just made me miss Chipotle. I did like that I could get a small version, as a regular burrito is just too big. 

Service: all the workers were very nice and helpful as this was my first time trying this chain. 

Ambiance: clean and small. 

I will probably be back as it is convenient, I like getting a small version of a burrito, and I still can't get myself to return to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Place is close to us....I'm a big fan.  Burritos are legit.   No Chipotle close so this works just as well."}
{"text":"You've got to give this place a chance. Their meats are absolutely delicious. The Barbacoa is spicy! Chicken is seasoned perfectly. The steak is steak. If that makes any sense. 

In the last 24 hours since our initial visit, there is amazing consistency in their food quality. The establishment is well maintained and cleaned frequently. We've tried most, if not all, of their sauces. Don't drown out your meal by piling up all the add-ons. They drown out the fantastic taste of their meats. I ask for the sauces on the side and can add heat or sweetness as needed. The wild salsa, was spicy on top of their extreme habanero sauce. Holy moly!!! 

We will be back. I've left my original post below. But, I think I'm loving this place. 

-----------------------

I really wanted to love this place. The owner and staff are super friendly. The restaurant is very clean. Prices are the same as Chipotle and Qdoba. Food portions are comparable. 

But there was no flavor in the food. I had the spicy chicken burrito bowl, easy white rice, black beans, Pico de gallo, med red salsa, sour cream, lettuce and cheese. They gave me a couple sides of the sauces - hot head and ranch. The sauces were great it was necessary. 

I'll come back again and try it with the other sauces. Because I really want to love this place."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this location. It had the worst customer service. I got the bowl,the steak meat and brown rice were cold upon its arrival. Skip this place. The one in Southern Highlands is so much better."}
{"text":"First time, last time. :( wasn't anything special. Wasn't terrible just was expecting a better burrito. Beans and rice are cold. The only thing warm is the tortilla and meat. Cheese is still hard. The flavors just didn't blend well
For those who do love hot head burrito, Tuesday is double sticker day!"}
{"text":"This is a direct competitor to Chipotle.  Set up in pretty much the same way.  I had lunch here today and thought it was OK.  I can't say that it's better than Chipotle because they have ground beef and Chipotle doesn't.  Like other reviewers.  I think that's funny.  I wanted to order what I thought is pretty much the same thing I get at Chipotle for comparison sake.

I had to wait in line and there are 2 boards to look at while waiting.  Then, the line takes a turn where they make up the food to the right at an angle.  And the boards above it can't be seen from the line.  I was pretty annoyed I couldn't read the majority of the menu while I waited.

I ordered a chicken bowl with lettuce, tomato, fajita veggies, squash and zucchini, tomato, corn, green salsa, and the mild finishing sauce.  The fajita veggies and the squash and zucchini were all raw.  I prefer these items to be cooked.  The lettuce, tomato, and corn either came out of a bag or was made a day or two ago as they didn't seem fresh.  I liked the chicken.  It was cooked tender with good seasoning.  I like that they offer a finishing sauce.   It was just way too sweet.

The line had 4 people working it and 1 cashier at the end.  With 5 people working the line total you would expect it to be pretty quick.  By comparison to a Chipotle it was very slow.  The bottleneck was the cashier.  It took her too long to ring out everyone that 4 people behind her was processing.  

The food itself tasted good, not great.  This place didn't make me want to give up Chipotle any time soon.  But I'll try it a couple more times and update my review if it warrants an update.

I give this place a 3.5 out of 5.  When I think if its closer to a 4 or a 3 I'd say its closer to a 3 on the scale so that's what I'm giving them."}
{"text":"Service was great, very helpful for a first time guest. Serving size was very large, I have over half my burrito bowl leftover post-meal. 

They also offered plain rice(with no cilantro), in white or brown, which was delicious because I'm not a cilantro fan. The food was fresh and there was a good variety of meats and sauces (almost too many options). 

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went to this location the other day, I didn't know it was open for a few months already, they had grand opening signs everywhere, I guess just to let people know they were already open. It's located in the Target parking lot next to the brand new Starbucks and Tropical Smoothie.

It's not a chipotle or a cafe rio, but it has the similarities of them both. You have your choices from a bowl, to burrito, salad or tacos, you choose your meats which the barbacoa and the pork were really good, then you have veggies which are a little weak, wish they had more selection, and the sauces. 

Customer service is good, but they have the music so loud you literally have to talk loud for them. The prices are alright, I think a tad overpriced but overall it's good food. 

One thing though is I hope they work on hand washing, that's one thing I did notice, it's a huge health and food safety violation. I've been in food and beverage for 11 years."}
{"text":"Tried a new spot leaving target omg so delicious everything tasted fresh and the hotheads sauce was amazing great staff as well we will def be back"}
{"text":"It's delicious..like Chipotle but without the E-coli!! We had the steak burrito which was huge for my standards and the Barbacoa burrito bowl. It was delicious!! I don't understand people complaining \"it's not Mexican\" YOUR RIGHT..IT ISN'T MEXICAN. NOWHERE IN THE RESTURANTS DOES IT DAY MEXICAN ANYWHERE. It says Burritos!!!!  It's great fresh food at a good value!"}
{"text":"Found it a pretty good deal. Super tasty sauces. And depending on what you like on your burrito. It can get HUGE. Can't get a full gamut of flavor huge. Gotta take several bites across the thing. $8 when I went for full size one."}
{"text":"Wow is this food good!!! The prices are a bit out but I was more than willing to pay. My one issue was the choice of music. A bit too loud and often vulgar."}
{"text":"Terrible tacos. Soft taco stuck to wrapper so it tore when trying to pick it up. Chicken and steak had no flavor. 
Putting shredded cheese on chips doe not make nachos. Would have been better if cheese as melted. 
Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"The staff here was was very friendly here except for the unhappy franchise owner. This is the second time we've been here the first time was great this time was disappointing. When we asked for a kids quesadilla with chicken ( which we offered to pay for the chicken) the owner said couldn't be done...really?? Then we just ordered a adult chicken quesadilla for our child. The owner then says we can pay for chicken on the side of the cheese quesadilla.....that's not the same as a chicken quesadilla! Poor customer service...prob will not be back at this location."}
