{"text":"I would absolutely not recommend this place for anything other than grabbing a quick beer or shot, and even then it's a bit spotty.  Tries to be a Pittsburgh sports bar, but in my opinion fails miserably in atmosphere.  Just because you have several Pittsburgh sports memorabilia on the wall, although some of it was neat and had a historical flare to it, doesn't make you a sports bar.  As far as the food, forget about it...terrible.  Menu was lacking in substance and was quite generic and bland in its description of the establishment's offerings.  My wife ordered a grilled salmon salad which was just okay (was all iceberg lettuce which is a travesty with any salad).  My son had the children's spaghetti and meatballs...sauce tasted old and straight out of a can or jar and the meatballs were over seasoned with garlic.  I had the All You Can Eat Fish which I must say was the most terrible fried fish I've had in the Pittsburgh area, but possibly anywhere.  I asked what kind of fish it was and it was something I had never heard of before.  It was overcooked and dry, with little to no flavor.  The french fries were undercooked and soggy, and my side of broccoli was overcooked and tasted unlike any broccoli I've had before.  Definitely don't eat here if you're looking for a decent tasting meal, let alone fresh.  When I told our server (who I think was the owner as well) about my fish dinner that I couldn't eat, she did apologize and took it off the bill, but said to me that she couldn't believe it was as terrible as I said because \"no one's ever said anything bad about our fish.\"  I found her statement extremely hard to believe given what they tried to serve me.  Additionally, not that I need to say more, but they had run out of the coleslaw which was supposed to come with the fish and after we ordered instructed us that it was going to take longer than usual to get our food because they were backed up.  Honestly, the place wasn't even close to being busy!!  It was an extremely disappointing restaurant experience with my family and all we were looking to do was try a place close by that we'd never been to before.  Our mistake...we should have known better!!"}
{"text":"I ate here once....Figured I passed it all the time on Route 8 and wanted to check it out.    It reminded me of the before in an episode of Restaurant Impossible.   The decor is dated, but not in a timeless divey bar fashion, the food we had was all frozen and nothing was fresh.     There are other places nearby that are much better for the same cost, and menu type.    Do yourself a favor and hit them up."}
{"text":"Went here with family to share a meal on a Friday night. I could not have been more disappointed . The service was actually good, but the food was terrible. It started with our appetizer plate. Nothing was fresh. All was frozen and  many were fried quickly, so the centers were still frozen. One of the kids ordered grilled cheese. It appeared to be a toasted roll with cold cheese. Not a bit melted. Red sauce on pasta was tasteless. It was very consistent: all bad. Won't be back to eat here!"}
{"text":"I went there to watch the Pittsburgh Steeler's on Monday night.  This place has a ton of character and looks like a throwback to the 70s style sports bar.  Beers are cheap, the bartender is friendly and interesting people to talk to.  Apparently, it's a vintage car hangout on Monday's in the Summer.  Cool collection of car photos on the wall.  Also, beer was dirt cheap!  I'll write another on the food when I go back next week."}
{"text":"We went here twice for Paint Nite, because this restaurant has a very nice set up for this event.  Inside, there is plenty of space set away from the bar.  They have a nice big parking lot.   The food was very good.  I got the grilled chicken salad- it was excellent and generous portion for the price. The staff were fun and friendly and did a GREAT job even with the Paint Nite and a Penguins playoff game both going on at the same time.  We will definitely go back for Paint Nites, and I'm now anxious to try out their Wednesday buffet and other specials!"}
