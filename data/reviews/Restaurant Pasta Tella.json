{"text":"I tried the Wienershnizel.  It came with shredded carrots and I think shredded beets and roasted potatoes and a slice of lemon.  The menu listed the Wienershnizel under Swiss specialties.  I would give them an extra star if they switched the roasted potatoes to Rosti - a more authentic Swiss potato dish."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was excited to try it however based on the tip I can verify its closed. There is now graffiti on the building."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions for a quick lunch with business associates as well as friends. The food is tasty and reasonably priced. I'll also mention that they have a room in the back, closed away for groups.

If I'm in town again and am looking for some excellent Italian food, this is where I'll come."}
{"text":"Upon ordering the waiter suggested to me that their veal was really good. Let me tell you this. Yes it is.

I was stupid and ordered the lasagna, this wasn't really spectacular. I can make much better lasagna. 

The veal with tomato sauce was amazing. Definatly a good choice.  The veal was very tender.   

I'm not sure if I'd go back. It's worth trying once but not really a bind blowing experience."}
{"text":"Passed by today and there was a sign that the restaurant is now closed as the building is set to be demolished this summer to make way for a new condo unit."}
{"text":"Pasta Tella is a great restaurant, to begin.

The food is exquisite. I've had good filet of sole, but they take the cake. It was buttery, it was crispy, it was soft, it was firm. It melted in my mouth. The price is very reasonable. At around $25-30 CAD per person, and the food they serve, the price is really good. While there are a great deal of many restaurants in this area, Pasta Tella is a place I will return to when I am back in Montreal."}
