{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte !!! To start we were welcome very nicely p, the server and host were super nice, to start you must order some dumplings!!! They were amazing!!! All the dishes we ordered were great honey chicken , sweet and sour chicken, pineapple shrimp , and shrimp chow main!! We also had a fried banana and ice cream for dessert that was great!!! Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"My family used to come here quite a number of times when I was little. I recently came back here since I remember my family talking about how good the food here is. The decor is gorgeous they put a lot of effort into it. Can't say the same for the quality of the food. 

The prices of the food is reasonable and it looks really good. It also tasted very good especially the lo mein. However, the first time I came back here, my tummy felt a little queasy after eating the food. I thought it might have to do with something else and not the food here, but then I came here a second time. I ended up having very bad food poisoning the second time and I'm positive it's because of the food here. I have no idea what their sanitary rating is but God I am never coming back here."}
{"text":"The curry shrimp and chicken was cooked to perfection and a huge portion of food. Some of the best Chinese food I have had in years!!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent, the food is top notch, atmosphere is refined, and the waitstaff is professional. I have been here twice and need to go back again. This is a traditional chinese style restaurant and the decor has a lot of attention to detail put into it. I will provide more detailed review of dishes at a later time as some time has passed since my last visits."}
{"text":"The only place in NC that makes great \"Singapore\". Maybe I am being overzealous with 4 stars because I have never sat in the actual restaurant or tried anything else on the menu but I have tried this dish from about 2 other restaurants and Wan Fu is the only ones that make it right."}
{"text":"For an Italian-American, I eat a lot of Chinese food.  I always have.  For some reason, my parents and I began eating Chinese food every Saturday night somewhere around 12 years of age and I've kept eating Chinese food at least once a week since then.  

Hands down, this is some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten!  And I've eaten Chinese food in Toronto, San Francisco, New York, and Philly - in Little China areas, nonetheless.

What makes WanFu the best?  The veggies always seem really fresh and the selection is different than what you'll see anywhere else.  For example, the WonTon soup has some fresh spinach leaves in it.  Have you ever seen that done anywhere?  I haven't, but the flavor it imparts is impeccable.  Vegetable fried rice includes big pieces of fresh red pepper, yellow squash, and asparagus.  And while some of the other dishes can be oversauced, the fried rice has a lot less sauce than any other place...and that allows the incredible flavor of these fresh veggies to glide delectably over your tastebuds.

It is a little more expensive than your typical Chinese restaurant, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was average and a little pricey.  PF Changs has much better food and service for the price."}
{"text":"It's hard to get authentic Asian food in Charlotte, but this place comes closest. The staff is extremely friendly and offers suggestions to alter the dish to your liking (spicier, more vegetables, etc) at no cost. The seafood tasted fresh and the portions were a perfect size for the price."}
{"text":"Wan Fu serves Chinese food cooked for American tastes. That being said, it is hard to get authentic ethnic food in Charlotte. Even so, I love eating at Wan Fu. Service is friendly. Food portions are filling."}
{"text":"Everything is great here. Food is very good, but only downside is that dinner menu can be a bit pricey. Got the sesame chicken and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Had our first visit on valentines day, did not make reservatioms, our mistake, the place was packed.  But the wait was well worth it.  To begin with everyone, and I do mean everyone, who works there was pleasant and working to make an emjoyable experience.

We started with a great appitizer of lettuce wraps, which had more food than we expected.  Our two meals, asian chicken and chicken shrimp broccoli dish, arrived shortly.  Both were very tasty and larger than we anticipated.

We wanted dessert, but the meals were more than filling.  Bill came to $40.  All in all, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Food is usually good, but went there on Christmas Eve and had a horrible experience. The kitchen was poorly managed and the staff was struggling to handle the demand . Front desk staff was rude and unapologetic  about the delays they were experiencing  in bringing out the food. I had placed a takeout order and was told it would be ready in 20 to 30 minutes. Got there and waited another hour before they got me the food. They had no idea how long it would take. On checking on the status, I was rudely told your food is not here. When it comes we will call out your name."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Atmosphere second to none. Staff was in sync, prompt, and courteous. Food and menu were great and left nothing to be desired. We were greeted when we arrived and thanked when we left. The restaurant layout can accommodate couples, small groups, and large groups. There are private dining areas as well as a bar. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Even with $30 Groupon for $15 its still overpriced....... 

Food is what you would expect from most fast food Chinese food places, however this is supposed to be a \"nice\" upscale restaurant. Prices are high around $15 and up. OK so the shrimp are a little larger than the $5 lunch restaurants, big deal, still had softer texture than it should have. 

On to service, and yes staff is everywhere, 3 different people came to take our order, one after the other.  It was kind of annoying because no one knew someone just came by 15 seconds before. Food came out real fast, again what I would expect from fast food restaurant. Obvious  success is based on turning tables, and getting me and family out the door.  All 3 dinners were all received at different times about one every 2 minutes, didn't seem right.   ....And then we never saw another server again......   No one  stopped by to ask is there anything else we can get you, ran out of beer, no chopsticks........

Bottom line is there is 2 very good restaurants you have to pass to get here, don't pass them.

WILL NOT RETURN OR RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Wan Fu for years. The food is fantastic, but lately some of the staff has been very argumentative and made our experiences less enjoyable. The worst was yesterday at lunch, they mixed up our order. We ordered a chicken steamer and vegetable spring role. They brought a vegetable steamer and chicken and shrimp spring roll. When we pointed out the error (the waitress had a strong accent, so we figured it was an honest mistake), the waitress became upset and argued with us that we ordered what was brought. She finally agreed to bring us what we had asked for, but set the new dish on the table with a bang and never came back. No apology and we were snubbed the rest of our visit. They did not thank us when paying or leaving as they usually do. It was very rude. I love the food here,  and don't even mind their higher prices, but they need to improve their customer service before we will return."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Charlotte. The service is also amazing! We go any chance we can. Our usual order consists of their pan fried pork dumplings, fried spring rolls, pineapple rice, general tao chicken, and mongolian beef. OMG so
Good!"}
{"text":"Great veggie dumplings which is why this place gets 2 stars instead of 1.

As I sit, I'm 2.5 hours into waiting on my to go order.  Their estimated time was 45 minutes. I've asked every 15 minutes and I've received every response from what can be described to \"go die\" to \"they are expediting it\". 

Customer service here is HORRIBLE.  Stay away."}
{"text":"At one time this place was great. 
Went back today, huge disappointment.
Beer was cold, staff was friendly. That's about as complimentary as I can be.
Food was not good, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Wan-Fu today. Based on the good reviews I've been wanting to try this place for a long time but the location is a little out of the way for me.

First thing we noticed was that the service was really friendly and attentive. We went for the Kung Pao chicken and the Bang Bang Shrimp.

I really liked the chicken, you could tell that all ingredients were fresh and the chicken was plentyful. The shrimp were also nice, came in a curry sauce that I personally wouldn't necessarily associate with Chinese food. But it was good.

We didn't care for the spring rolls. Found them to be too bland and not a lot of filling. But then again: can't remember the last time I had a really good spring roll...

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, went there after purchasing the deal on Living Social and was pleasantly surprised, Food was great and service superb!!!!!!!!!!!  I will be back ."}
{"text":"Ordered tangerine chicken with mixed vegetables. Looks like I got yesterday's leftover food. 5 pieces of old broccoli and 5 pea pods. The chicken was hideous. The chicken was in clumps held together by gristle and was not white meat. It had no flavor. A terrible meal and a terrible waste of money."}
{"text":"Awesome! If you're looking for quality amazing Chinese food, this is the place! Traditional Chinese atmosphere with welcoming service! I had the kung pao chicken. It was the best Chinese I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.  Love the lettuce wraps....more than enough food for lunch.  Well balanced and delicious dishes.  I go here anytime I am in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"The menu selection is HUGE... sharing of entrees among table guests is encouraged so everyone gets to sample a variety of menu offerings if dining in a group. I found 4 of 5 entrees to be quite good (& one was ok, just not my taste).

However, Wan Fu does not offer EGG ROLLS nor EGG DROP SOUP. I have had spring rolls several places, but I found Wan Fu's spring rolls to be a bit \"mushy\" on the palate and \"egg-roll\" like in size compared to thinner longer spring rolls served at other places I've been.

The restaurant is a good place to celebrate a birthday... free dessert with candles and song. Seems to be a place enjoyed by children (& families). A good sign when Asians dine at a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty much one of the best (and most affordable) Chinese restaurants you'll ever find in Charlotte! Wan Fu is a great place for authentic, affordable Chinese food you won't find anywhere else in the area. I eat here often with my family and the Emperor Shrimp is to die for - The fish was extremely good, very crispy and covered with a sweet and spicy sauce. Lobster with ginger was amazing, nothing I've ever tasted before. The staff at Wan Fu make you feel like you are always being taken care of. Would definitely go back with my family, and to those of you who have never been, you should give it a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Every time  when  am in the area from Las Vegas I'll dine at Wan Fu!  Food is always great  and I've eaten in a lot of Chinese restaurants  all  over Las Vegas and in China as well.  I have never been disappointed the last 6 years I've been there."}
{"text":"Clean, well decorated restaurant. Great service. Portions aren't huge as most Chinese places. I prefer quality over quantity. This place does it right!
Velvet corn soup was tasty.  Sa cha beef was done well and loaded with fresh vegetables.
I went into the restaurant at 945pm and didn't feel rushed or inconveniencing the staff as most places do at the end of the night."}
{"text":"went through door dash. thete was a mix up! but was corrected. I was mad when I called but they still made it right (now I feel bad)  we are all only human!  food was great! even for delivery!  will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, loved the Chicken Chow Fun.  Service was good.  Portions were awesome and prices are not too bad."}
{"text":"Had great expectations on eating here and was definitely disappointed to say the least.  May have had an off night but service was nice enough just that forgot to put half of our order in for the kitchen.  Had the feeling of being rushed the whole time there. Half of the main courses as well as the starters came out at the same time. Food was decent enough but was luke warm at best.  After bringing attention of the forgotten main courses to our waitress we were told that other dinner would be out in ten minutes. No apologies or anything just that we would wait for ten minutes.  After the twenty minute mark and still no food decided to count my lose and ask for the check."}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  Outstanding service.  We love the Wan Fu Scallops and order it often.  Inexpensive bottles of wine are a nice plus.  Their portions are large and it is a cozy place.   Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Wan fu is the best Chinese in the area ..I know my Chinese and this is the place to go and we do often . anything they make is great . sa cha scallops. Kung pao chicken . hot and sour soup . the dumpling/pot stickers are the way to start .. And the building its self is a site to see its very fancy'ish but they love the kids !! Lunch specials are cheap"}
{"text":"Wow!  Wan Fu is excellent.  The restaurant itself is huge and well appointed.  There is plenty of space for large groups.  We had a large group and ended up getting a ton of food and passing around.  One of my favorite dishes was a kind of duck taco.  It was delicious!  Everything else I tried was great as well.  Wan Fu is definitely a far cry from cheap Chinese buffets.  The service was very friendly and attentive and being locally owned is a big plus!"}
{"text":"I am new to charlotte and tried this place at the recommendation of other helpers...my family and I were not disappointed! The beef chow fun was delicious and so was the beef and broccoli. The servers here were very attentive and kind. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Chinese food I have ever had. I have been there several times, tried something different each time and was always pleased. I recommend the cashew chicken, walnut chicken, and the sesame tofu. The vegetarian options are great. The other awesome thing is if you get the clipper magazine there will almost always be a coupon in there for buy one get one free. My boyfriend and I agree this is a place to go to often."}
{"text":"I LOVE this places hot and sour soup....best hot and sour soup of any chinese restaurant I've ever been to!  The orange chicken is also fantastic. 

For a fine dining chinese restaurant, food and beverage is reasonably priced.  I think you get value for the caliber of resturant and quality of fare.

They do \"Team Service\" which can get annoying.  Several reviews have commented on being attended to by more than one person, and this can be confusing and bothersome.  This must be an Asian thing, because most asian pacific restaurants I go to that have sit down service adhere to the team service principle.  Ah, dammit...now I'm sterotyping.  I'll stop.

A really good Chinese alternative if you are wanting something other than lo mein from a cardboard box.  Think P.F. Chang's, but cheaper!"}
{"text":"It was definitely a pleasant surprise to find this great Chinese restaurant. The ambience is very comfortable and enjoyable. The manager was friendly, helpful, and has a great personality. All the dishes we ordered were succulent and authentic. It was a treat to my friends and I who had lived in China for some years, dying to find authentic Chinese food in the States."}
{"text":"Every year my club holds it's Christmas dinner here. We don't even discuss it any more; we know the service will be great and the food better.   

My personal favorite? Try sweet and sour anything -- the best duck sauce I've tasted. 

Bring friends and share your selections on the lazy Susans on the big round tables. That's how to discover the excellent offerings at your new favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is five star.  Decor and lighting set a great mood. I actually felt a bit under dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans but I wasn't the only one dressed so casually.  The food was so so.  If you like Americanized Chinese you will be delighted as it was certainly a cut above most with that sort of menu.  I, on the other hand, love Chinese cuisine and even cook it extensively at home and do not appreciate the hybridization so much.  I ordered the tofu vegetable soup, pork dumplings, gai lan with oyster sauce, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the steamed basa in black bean sauce.  The soup had a nice chicken broth but the tofu was lacking, just a couple slivers.  The vegetables in the soup were a frozen medley* variety with the processed baby carrots, snow peas, and cauliflower.  The pork dumplings were certainly made in house and quite good. The gai lan with oyster sauce was actually shanghi tips (baby bok choy) with a thin brown sauce that was quite light in flavor and a sprinkling of jarred minced garlic ontop, not what we ordered (or on the menu as we could tell).  The eggplant in garlic sauce came to the table as eggplant with a szechuan style sweet and sour sauce.  The fish came to the table as a steamed fillet on a plate with the same frozen vegetable* ontop except the medley was peppers, onions, carrot, broccoli.  The sauce was not radically different than the sauce accompanying the shanghi tips with the addition of a sprinkling of fermented black beans in lieu of the garlic.  We gobbled it up, afterall it was Thanksgiving for these out-of-towners, and it wasn't bad.  In the end the name says it all: an American imitating a Chinese accent asking if you \"want food\".

*After reading my post I should add that everything was cooked to proper tempurature.  The frozen vegetables I referenced were in fact cooked!"}
{"text":"First time here. Cool looking place. The waiter was great. Really like how you can customize any dish. San bei chicken was terrific!"}
{"text":"Oh Wan Fu, you were a big disappointment.  I purchased a living social deal after reading all the great reviews and we decided to use our deal last week.  The two of us arrived and had to wait quite a bit as it was busy.  

We were finally seated in an area with plenty of open tables.  The hostess took our drink order, then we waited and waited for the server to come take our food order.  After that was taken, our food came out very quickly!

We started with the steak skewers appetizer.  That was fun to cook and it was very tasty! Then our main entrees came, I got the Sesame chicken and Kevin got the Hunan chicken.  Mine was okay, not the best sesame chicken I've had and Kevin's chicken was just okay as well.  The broccoli in his dish was amazing as it soaked up the flavor so well!  Don't get me wrong, the food had good flavor and you get good portion sizes, but I wasn't wowed and I've had better.

After we finished, we waited and waited and waited for our server to finally box up our food and bring us our check.  Their servers are really slacking and I think that is because they are trying to have them do too much.  I saw my server in the bar area while we were waiting to be seated, saw her answering phones to take orders, then of course being a server.  It is fine if you want to give your servers multiple tasks, but give them 3-4 tables only, not 10.

There are other places with better food and better services that we will not be back."}
{"text":"After living in the area for over a year now, I have not found a Chinese restaurant that I would go back a second time..until now. This place gave me some relief that Charlotte does have good Chinese food. I ordered shrimp lo mein as a carry out, the food was ready when they said it would be. I walked in to pick up my order, I counted four employees and no one acknowledged that I walked in. I stood at the counter staring at my pick up order for about five minutes before anyone cashed me out for the food. I'm glad the food is better than the customer service i received. The portion size is good and they gave me a lot of shrimp. This is the first dish I tried so far, so that and the customer service is why I rate it three out of five stars. I will visit this restaurant again. Also, the health sanitation rating is a 95% so that showed me that they kept their business clean."}
{"text":"Wan Fu just got an extremely low sanitation score. (These restaurant sanitation scores are published in the local free weekly south Charlotte newspaper) But I don't care because their food is delicious and I haven't barfed yet.

Wan Fu has a pleasant atmosphere and some of the hardest working servers around. The staff dress in beautiful traditional Chinese outfits. They try really hard to do the best job possible. 

The food seems high quality and expertly prepared. The dishes are generous and worth the price. The cost is fairly high but you get your money's worth. Order with confidence and know that if you want to try something that you normally don't order, it will be made correctly. What I'm trying to say is that if you don't like the dish you order, it will be because of your taste preference and not because Wan Fu has poorly turned out that particular choice.

Bottom line is: great Chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"From living in NYC for 27 years I tried this place and I took one bite and threw it all away. And very expensive"}
{"text":"It was Chinese New Year and go get some Chinese food again and it was a cool place I don't like the music over there make me kind of headache and I order sanbei chicken I don't think they cook it right but that spicy dumplings so sosososo great I am very glad that I have ordered that"}
{"text":"Food was okay.  I'm Asian and I am not discriminating when I say as most Asian restaurants, the service is the biggest drawback.  There's a bar at the entrance, but good luck finding a bartender who will serve you.  Beverages for kids are limited - no lemonade or fruit punch.  Will not make it a point to return."}
{"text":"Thought I would give it another shot after a previous bad experience. 

My wife and I got an appetizer and three entrees (wanted leftovers for lunch). All were bland and tasted as if they were made with cheap ingredients by an amateur chef. 

If you are only familiar with mall Chinese maybe you would like this place. Definitely the kind of place you want to stick to the most basic type of order possible. Giving it 2 stars because the decor is nice and the food was edible."}
{"text":"After many years of going to Wan Fu, I think the quality is still just as good as on my first visit.  Today I did not eat in but called to place a takeout order at lunch time. My order was ready within 15 minutes.

The lunch menu is a great value..  I got Kung Pao chicken ($8.25) with brown rice. They will sub the brown rice instead of white rice at no additional charge. Also, the lunch entrée comes with a veggie spring roll. However if you ask for spring roll with shrimp & chicken, they don't up charge for that either.

They use fresh veggies and good cuts of chicken unlike most places in those strip shopping centers. Also, I never have that icky feeling I get when I eat at a place that uses too much MSG in their food.

Wan Fu, keep doing what you're doing and you will remain my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have found a restaurant that I hate and is this one. Hate the atmosphere, so dark during the day. The food is terrible. I've had good food and this place was not it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate for the first time today at Wan Fu.  All the while, I tried to convince myself that there had to be at least one caveat to this place, but I daresay that my lunch experience here was perfect.

The building is absolutely gorgeous on the outside and inside the restaurant as well!  The architecture appears to be uniquely Chinese and is meticulously detailed.  Inside is a dimly lit, very clean dining area with many tables and rooms.

The food was phenomenal and the servings, enormous.  I ordered shrimp lo mein with a vegetable spring roll.  The spring rolls were tasty and fresh, but my lo mein entrée was out of this world.  The shrimp were succulent, tender and perfectly spiced and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  This was the best lo mein I've had in recent memory.  My lunch was reasonable, totaling about $10.

The service was excellent; everyone there was personable.  Our waitress was very kind and attentive.  Overall, just a wonderful experience.

I have not one bad thing to say for Wan Fu.  I will be returning here to try other dishes on their lengthy menu."}
{"text":"Coming into Wan Fu you leave the outside world behind. Nice decor, serene atmosphere, and pleasant music.  Quality ingredients and consistently good preparation are hallmarks here.  Tangerine Beef is one of many delicious choices.  If you're searching for the best Chinese in Charlotte, look no further..."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I've been here a few times for lunch and then dinner. All times have left me satisfied! The coconut shrimp is amazing as is the wonton soup. Definitely go! You may have to wait a while if at dinner time (we waited 30 minutes on a Saturday evening), but it's worth it."}
{"text":"What else can you add when every time we eat here it is so delicious ... Edward and his team of servers are remarkable ! Shrimp steamer for me and pan seared shrimp for the hubs and finished off with a mango cake with chocolate sauce ... Delectable food with remarkable service makes for a wonderful experience - Every Single Time"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  The problem is they rush you in and out so quickly that it's borderline rude.  I always put Wan Fu low on my list because of this."}
{"text":"Very solid Chinese food. The lady with short hair who works came around and talked to everyone.  She was awesome and seemed to care about our general experience.  This place can get a little busy so i would suggest a reservation if possible.  Also, they do not have craft beer, but many different beer from Asian countries."}
{"text":"Have been here twice on our drive back to New York from Florida.

The first time we were very happy with the quality of the food. Flavor was excellent. Employees were friendly. Took a little longer that expected to get the food, but was prepared well once we got it.

The second visit was not as good unfortunately.  The food was mediocre at best.  The waiter asked where we were from, when we told them we were from New York, he commented that the food was probably not as good as what we usually get in New York.  While that may be true to some extent, that doesn't explain why the food would come out luke warm and the rice under cooked.  It's rice!"}
{"text":"Seriously a Gem! You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside but inside is nice, clean and seriously some authentic Chinese food. Please don't get it confuse, no fusion or Japanese offerings and no sushi. But the service was fast, prices was decent and food was delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Their fried rice is gluten free and they can make the chow fun without soy sauce. Both are very good. My son also loves their chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Been coming here for at least 4 years now.  Delicious food, good service and reasonable prices.  Also, the food comes out so fast, everytime!!  There's usually a small wait, 20-30 minutes, on a Saturday night but they have comfortable seating and I believe wi-fi.  Parking lot is small and very cramped but everything else is great."}
{"text":"Other than Chinese dimsum, hands down I have to say wanfu have the best Chinese food. Fantastic family restaurant and I go to eat family style. Order a lot and everyone pic at this and that. Love the shrimp, and imperial plate. Always gotta get that pineapple fried right and lobster"}
{"text":"Fried rice was dry. Tasteless. Food like leftovers or something a college kid made in his dorm. First time there and made a special trip because of reviews. Really people?? Just not anything special ... at all. 

Food was tasteless. Waste of money."}
{"text":"It did the trick. My belly was delightfully full."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  They are very family oriented and make you feel welcome.  Their food is fresh and prepared with care.  Their menu is extensive.  They have dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. We go put of our way to get takeout from here."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, real good chicken and beef gives you the best Sacha chicken you have ever eaten. I drive across town just for that. The people are friendly and the place is very clean. I don't like everything there, but I have found many favorites."}
{"text":"Everytime we eat here the food is fantastic! Service is generally pretty fast. We love the Teriyaki Beef Sticks."}
{"text":"(Sunday Nov 9, 2014) We were seated immediately as opposed to waiting 30 minutes at Outback next door. The atmosphere was very warm and comfortable. Wan Fu has changed their menu radically. It used to be akin to a small novel,  now it's a two sided laminated board.  We sat down and ordered the Szechuan wonton with peanut/chili oil sauce, a spring roll , hot & sour soup & pork fried dumplings to start. All our choices were excellent! 
For our main courses my wife had the tangerine beef and I ordered Sa cha beef & scallops. She said that her beef was excellent and very flavorful. The kitchen apparently forgot my scallops. A manager was checking on tables and offered to re - make the dish for me. I thought that was very thoughtful but we were nearly done eating so the price of the dish was lowered to reflect beef only. He gave me a coupon for $15 off our next visit with a purchase of $50 worth of food!  That was extremely nice of him. Of course we'll be back."}
{"text":"For Dessert check out my photo of my Fortune Cookie Message (fitting Fortune for me since I finished two Desserts by myself)!  This Holiday season is not the easiest time to start a diet!

This was my first dine ever at Wan Fu.  If you are not looking for it you may never see it from Highway 51.  So if you do not know where it is, consult the map!

Hopefully all of my reviews were written keeping in mind where I am for example, Wan Fu is primarily Chinese, so my aim is to mostly compare it to other (probably none yet that I have reviewed) Chinese Restaurants at a similar price range or if it makes more sense I would compare Diners to Diners and Not Diners to Upper-end Steak and Seafood Fine Dinning!  I hope that my love for Vietnamese, Thai and Korean does not reflect a cuisine from a different culture. So this is a harder review to write and judge fairly.  Most Chinese Restaurants I will avoid and never give them a chance.  Most of the others I have been to and would not return just to write a bad review!

Here was my dinner, comments and rating of each dish on this first visit:  Beef Appetizer good, not very good, just good 3.1 yelp stars.  Fresh Rolls, too much lettuce, still a good taste 3.2 stars.  Peanut Sauce, better than some (better than the ones that are primarily Hoison) though not to my liking 1.29 stars.  Plum Sauce, pretty good 3.5 stars.  The Entree:  Beef 3.2 stars, Sauce 3 stars, Vegetables: Asparagus and Red Peppers crunchy Fresh and perfectly cooked 5 stars.  Rice not rated!

Desserts:  The other one (I took Photos though I do not know what it was called)  I'd call it a Bomb Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate and more Chocolate = good enough for 3.8 yelp stars.  The second Dessert was a Black Forest Cheesecake something special for Black Forest Cake 3.55 stars (better than the one I had in a German Restaurant - In another review I said I am a hypocrite, so there!) the menu photo looked good and I was running out of choices until I leave this place and get more dessert.  Wait staff should never comment on the volume of food I order and they did not here, though they tried to bring me the check after the Appetizers and before each dessert and I had already asked about dessert after I placed my entree order!

The Service was a great Team effort, everyone was pleasant, polite and all dishes were served hot and as ordered!  For the service they get 5 yelp stars!  If you have not read my fortune cookie (see photo) from this visit what are you waiting for! ? !"}
{"text":"If you want good Chinese food in Charlotte, this is the only place.  I have had better Chinese food in San Fran and NYC, but this place has decent food. Order the whole fried fish."}
{"text":"Had their garlic shrimp and their Szechuan beef. Super delicious! Staff is very friendly and willing to answer any questions. We will most definitely be back! Cant wait to try other items from their menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome.   1st time being here and will be back.  Everyone should try it if able.   Was a little difficult to locate as it is behind outback steakhouse off of the road.  Nice interior and the staff was pleasant"}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service (from a team of folks, not just one). Hot and sour and wonton soups were excellent. Pork dumplings pan fried were as good as I have ever tasted. General Tso's is worth skipping. Garlic chicken was good - very \"clean\" flavor (not heavy)."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food.  Fast service yet everything tastes fresh.  Tea was steeped a little strong for my taste but still good.  They don't put the mushu together for you but they did give plenty of extra plumb sauce when I asked for more.  Definitely place to check out for the food and decor."}
{"text":"3 and 1/2 stars 
Better than good, however short of excellent. Dinner prices run high for the venue which makes it a better bet for lunch, particularly on weekends. 

The decor is kitschy Chinese -reminded me of movies from the 40's- the menu is extremely long, but there's nothing exotic or unusual about the choices. 

-Hot and Sour Seafood soup. ($3.50) Mildly spicy, it looked and tasted unlike the typical hot and sour offerings and we enjoyed the taste, particularly the enoki 'shrooms. The bowl was small but priced accordingly and enough for starters.
4 stars

- Cold Sesame Noodles w/ Peanut Sauce ($6) a serving of stale pasta noodles with a dollop of commercially made sauce on top. Not fit for consumption. 
0 stars

- Spring rolls, one meat one vegetarian Greasy, tasteless and pretty awful albeit when dipped the sauce made it passable.. barely. Personally I didn't feel cheated,  I'm no great fan of spring rolls, Since they're complimentary : 
no rating

- Bang Bang Shrimp was the favorite. (lunch $8.50, dinner $14.50) I found the flavor mildly spicy, complex and rich. The dish was described as a curry on a bed of angel hair pasta, not what I think of as curry and honestly there was barely any pasta at all however the shrimp was both abundant and excellent, I'd definitely order it again -for lunch.
4 stars

- Scallops in Garlic sauce w/mushrooms, peppers etc (same $8.50/$14.50) also mildly spicy and tasty but with less bite and too sweet for my taste. Lots and lots of large scallops, I'm giving it an extra 1/2 star for that reason only.
3 1/2 stars

The service was trying hard but was clumsy to the point of rudeness, maybe just a cultural thing. We found it amusing and I'm not deducting any points for it - however under the wrong circumstances I could see customers going postal.

Short of hiding an Opium den upstairs I don't see how this restaurant could be mistaken for any 5 star establishment. However those with no expectations other than a good Chinese meal will likely be satisfied."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic chinese restaurant yet the food and atmosphere ARE amazing! Also, the host of the establishment is so kind. I am glad to of found this gem and will be back!"}
{"text":"Wanfu is the best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte I have ever ate at. It has the most authentic,fresh quality food you could ever have. There service is absolutely fantastic and all of there workers are very nice and friendly. I most love the tangerine chicken, and the seafood pan fried noodles but overall I think all of there dishes that I have tried there tastes very good. This is a great restaurant and there prices are decent but great food!"}
{"text":"I will first give the caveat that we went on Valentines Day for our first visit to this restaurant.  There was an hour long wait, which, though we were not thrilled with, we took to be a good sign.  That said - We were somewhat disappointed with this restaurant. The décor is interesting but a bit dated.  The food was simply not up to the prices that are being charged.  The Moo Shu pork was pretty bland with only 4 wrappers and two tablespoons of plum sauce.  The dumplings were decent but a bit overcooked.  The hot & sour soup tasted like a mix though it had plenty of mushrooms and chicken. The jasmine tea didn't taste like anything resembling jasmine.  In fact, we asked the waitress if they had made a mistake and she said that they only had jasmine tea - no other choice.  On a $50 meal for 2 people I was just looking for better quality.  Could it have been an off night because of the volume of people - possibly.  Still, there are much better Chinese restaurants for the money in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by saying I hVe been spoiled... Been to China a couple times and grew up in Flushing, NY which is the REAL Chinatown...and now I've arrived at Wan Fu.  The decor is a little overwhelming but cute.  You are greeted by a very welcoming host who takes you to your table and them the fun begins.
We started with Jasmin tea which was perfectly steeped and then on to the soup!  Hot and sour soup was EXCELLENT!  Well balanced, not full of cornstarch and amazing flavor.  The wonton soup was delicious! Made with chicken which was an interesting surprise and tasty.  Not too salty :-). Next we shared the veggie dumplings which were good, nothing special but good if you like veggie dumplings. My husband had General Tso chicken(I have never enjoyed this dish as I don't think it is actually chinese food) but he enjoyed it and they make everything to order so it was super fresh.  At the server's recommendation I had the Szechuan beef.  It was not what I was used to as it was overly sweet and not at all spicy and it was heavily coated in cornstarch .... Kinda like general Tso so I didn't really enjoy it.  I feel like they may dumb down some of their dishes to cater to the American palate but I will be more forgiving than usual because of the amazing soup and freshness of the food.  I will definitely be back but steer clear of the Szechuan beef...but that's just me"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte! I had the Schezhan Chicken Dumplings, amazing!!!! I also had the walnut chicken. The chicken was so tender and the sauce was a little sweet and creamy, oh man, delicious! The service was on par, fast, helpful, nice. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice Chinese food. Nothing extraordinary, but just a good place to eat. Staff is ver accommodating and fast."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte! The chicken and broccoli was very good! The chicken and shrimp fried rice was good as well. It says 2 people could share one item.....not so sure about that."}
{"text":"Always great food and good service. Their hours are a little weird so be aware being heading their way.  Their pineapple fried rice is awesome."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Definitely a little hidden gem in Pineville. If you are looking for delicious Chinese food and great service and atmosphere then this is your place! Can't say enough good things about the service and staff. The food was also very delicious and reasonably priced! The main entrees are enough food to share with another person Can't wait to go back to try something different!"}
{"text":"We'd been here many, many years ago, and must have gotten standard Chinese cuisine because I don't remember it at all. This time I went with friends who are regulars, and got to experience many new foods. Top notch for me were the Crab Rangoon, Lettuce Wraps and Cold Sesame Noodles..wow. The waiter forgot to bring me back a container with that amazing Peanut Sauce, though! Favorites of our friends were also the Seafood Hot Pot and Eggplant, neither of which I cared for. The service was quick, friendly and helpful. I am definitely looking forward to going back. The hard part will be what to select from all the amazing dishes!"}
{"text":"Sad to say but went to this place after originally wanting nakatos but seeing the parking lot and wait time we kept it moving to find something close by. We ended up at Wan Fu and the spring rolls were tasty however cannot say the same for the crab ragoons did not like the mixture on the inside and were very greasy to the touch. For entrees we ordered veggie and pineapple fried rice and both tasted bland. the food might not have been spot on at this place but the decor and character of the place was very authentic."}
{"text":"Take out review only: wonton soup was pretty good, the spring rolls were dripping in grease so we just tossed them. My wife had the chicken lo mein, and she liked it, I had a kung pao chicken, again it was good, but they maybe went a little heavy with the chili oil, it wasn't spicy really, just every bite was super super oily. I've been coming here since I was a teenager however, and it can be hit or miss sometimes."}
{"text":"Wan Fu is always a good idea with family. Mother's Day is busy for the restaurant but our moms really enjoy it. 
The only authentic Chinese restaurant in Charlotte that is consistent and you know exactly what you're getting."}
{"text":"Superb. Everything was top notch including the service which was friendly and attentive.  Appetizers and entrees were great. We will back soon."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! The only place I'd gladly drive to Charlotte just to eat. Great service, good vibe, extremely clean and bright!! Location is a bit difficult should you not be familiar with the area. I believe it's behind Outback off of Pineville-Matthews Rd. Pineapple chicken is wonderful, fun place to go as a group!!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to another place when I realized I've never tried this place! Wow ! It is absolutely beautiful inside I wish I had dressed up more but not needed ! We were sat promptly.  The menus is large and has so many unique choices I was having trouble selecting an order. The waiter came over and told us any of the dishes could be made exactly how we wanted and suggested a few things.  On his suggestion I got chicken with cashew with garlic sauce ! I love chicken with cashew but never had the garlic sauce! Oh wow that dish was amazing!! This place is clean and the staff are really nice !!  Don't pay attention to the pictures of the food on the menu it doesn't do it justice! It was fresh and delicious ! Also I got a Buddha beer it was unique and good. Ask the wait staff for suggestions they were so helpful!"}
{"text":"Jean Claude Wan Damn, this place ROCKS!! Unlike Kickboxer 2, our second visit as a Yelpinator was outstanding!!!  

Not only was the food just friggin awesome, we ordered two of the same dishes and this place evidences a key tenet...consistency!  Omg, General Tao (5/5) is just straight up the best I have had, no gelatinous sauce and fried to perfection!

The fried rice with shrimp (5/5) makes yours eyes water it's so damn good!  It's not salty or heavy or oily in an over the top way;  it's rapture!

The vegetable lomein (5/5) my wife said is the best she's ever had.  The whole seasoning was just perfect; not overly done, oily, or salty.

We sat there and really challenged ourselves if it REALLY is that good, cause we some eatin fools especially Los chino, and we all agreed; no other Chinese  restaurant came to mind that was close!

You've got to try it!!"}
{"text":"Wan Fu's employees opened the door precisely at 11:30 a.m. The young lady who did so greeted me warmly with a smile. 

Inside there were THREE maitre d's.  I didn't have to slow my pace after entering the front door, since I was immediately led to a booth to be seated. The gentleman who took me to my table was very polite and friendly. 

My bookmark for Wan Fu said, \"spicy beef with broccoli, dumplings, and Tiger beer.\" I didn't order any of those. What struck my fancy for lunch was spicy Hunan pork with vegetables and white rice, which has become one of my favorite go to Chinese menu items. 

As I was waiting for my food to be prepared people started to arrive. It was easy to see that there were many regulars. The gentleman who seated me was familiar with each diner, and he knew their favorite orders in advance. 

My food took about fifteen minutes to arrive. It was brought by what I assumed what the chef, who was a distinguished and competent looking, well dressed Chinese gentleman in his late fifties. A chef has to be proud of their food skills and presentation to personally bring the dish to the table. 

The food was as beautifully plated as shown in the photos on Yelp. I expected the chef to be talented and competent, and that proved to be the case. 

There was a generous amount of sliced pork in the dish. The mushrooms, carrots, and broccoli were perfectly prepared, and not cooked to death. The white rice was also on point. 

A small vegetable roll was provided with the meal, and it was crispy and delicious. It was served with Chinese sweet and sour sauce or ???. 

The sweet iced tea was unlike any sweet tea that I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. This was primarily because it wasn't too sweet, and secondly, it didn't have the jasmine flavor of other Americanized Chinese restaurants. Other diners were ordering their iced tea \"half & half\" to circumvent the southern sweet tea stigma of diabetes in a glass, but it wasn't necessary at Wan Fu. 

My impressions of the food and the restaurant?

Wan Fu was simply and tastefully decorated, not over the top like some Chinese restaurants that I've experienced in San Francisco and New York. The napkins were linen. 

ALL of the employees were super friendly, courteous, and attentive. Service was definitely five stars. When the waitstaff was tied up with customers, the chef/owner? came out of the kitchen to seat diners and to inquire whether refills were needed. That's above and beyond in my book. 

Spicy Hunan Pork? The dish was good, but it didn't WOW me. The dish was definitely Americanized, and watered down to the stereotypical American wimpy taste buds. It wasn't the least bit spicy. I remedied that by requesting hot chili oil, which was expeditiously brought to my table. This improved the taste tremendously. If you like your food on the hot and spicy side, follow my example. Life is better with hot chili oil. 

My bill was: $8.25 for the Hunan Pork + $1.95 for the iced tea + $.85 for tax = $11.05. I left a 30% tip, because I was impressed by every facet of the restaurant.

My only reservation would be their cleanliness rating, which has fluctuated between a low A at 91.0% to their current 95%. I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to be closer to a 100% sanitation rating. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=127442&esttst_cty=60

I recommend Wan Fu, and I would certainly return without hesitation. Maybe next time I'll actually order what I bookmarked to try."}
{"text":"Great place to be for a great family dinner . I would highly recommend the emperor's shrimp . They're amazing !"}
{"text":"Wan fu is not just any other Chinese restaurant. To me, it is the ONLY Chinese restaurant! Being born and raised in the area, I have had the privilege of enjoying this excellent food for nearly 20 years! I can not say that about any other restaurants in town. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff and ownership are superb. I look forward to my WEEKLY visit, whether with friends or alone, I won't miss it, it's that good! Try my favorite the Garlic Shrimp!"}
{"text":"Some fellow Yelpers had mentioned both Wan Fu and Baoding as some of the better places to get \"good\" Chinese in Charlotte. After a long day at Carolina Place Mall which is very close, my Yelp app said \"go to Wan Fu, you genius\". I obeyed. The exterior is very grand with a heavy wooden door guarded by limestone lions. 
The host/owner was very warm and friendly. The frostyTiger beer from Singapore was even more friendly.
To start: Cold Sesamee Noodles with Peanut Sauce 3/5 Stars - too heavy on the peanut sauce - tasted almost like peanut butter - you really need to stir it up well before serving. Tastes better the second day when it's refrigerator cold.
Pan Fried Dumplings 4/5 Stars - really nice filling, the wrappers were a little thick and doughy for my tastes.
One of our waiters suggested the entrees we ended up ordering. Szechuan Beef - spicy, savory with a little sweet and sour - they added broccoli at no additional charge. Wan Fu Scallops - spiced and seared, served with vegetables. Both were really good but the beef was better, hands down; 4/5 Stars.
My fortune cookie: Confucius says \"look behind you, it's Elvis!\" And when I turned back around, the food was boxed and dishes gone.The staff was a well chorographed team that kept food coming and old dishes cleared. Best hot Chinese tea I've had in ages!! Also, be prepared to eat leftovers for days as the portions are big!!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great. This is not your run-of-the-mill, shopping center based Chinese place. I will say that the food is fresh, and made to order. Everything tastes to be made in house. 

Wan Fu is expensive for Chinese food. Fried rice is not an option with your dinner, so we had to order an extra meal in order to get some. Hint: the fried rice is bland, and not worth it. The bang bang shrimp was pretty good, and my wife had honey chicken which she thought was average as well. 

There are lots of options out there for Chinese, so looks like we will be trying someplace else. We had very high hopes."}
{"text":"Food was basic.  No better, no worse than any other Chinese restaurant I have visited.  Hostess lady was nice.  Atmosphere was nice.  Service was super slow.   We came because of the ratings. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So many things wrong with this place. First, it's owned by a Vietnamese lady and her husband from Guam. They bought it from Mr. Lee, the original owner. Nothing wrong with that. But it's not truly authentic Chinese food. They don't even know what Wan Fu means. It means 10,000 fortunes. 

2nd. They reuse sauces and other things. If you order anything with a sauce and don't finish said sauce, it will be recycled for the next customer, etc Chinese mustard, duck sauce, hot oil. If you order pineapple fried rice, it comes in a half of pineapple shell. The half of the pineapple is used at least 5 times before they discard. I'm pretty sure that's a health code violation right there! You may be asking how do I know? I used to work there. I was told not to throw away sauces or pineapple halves. 

3rd. They're also violating NC labor laws. They'll pay $10.00 for a half day on the first day, which is from 5 to 11. NO TIPS. They'll say it's a trial day. Then they pay you 10% of your earned tips up to 100%, depending on how hard the boss lady thinks you work. I got up to 60% in 2 months. Dare I ask where did the other 40% go to? I've worked at TGI Fridays and many sushi restaurants and NONE has this pay structure. I worked hard but they never gave me what I deserved. I lost 8 pounds cleaning tables and sweeping the floor under the table after EACH table left. I never made over $60 a night! Well never \"got\" because 40% of my tips were stolen! One day, I was at the server station, where they posted a giant poster from the NC Labor department. I was reading it. It said restaurants have to pay 85% of tips earned or minimum wage an hour. I was getting neither. No other server could understand that poster due to their lack of English. I'm a college graduate. I merely found myself in a financially difficult situation at the time. I wanted to get cash every day, WHILE staying legal. Thus I  confronted the Vietnamese lady boss with this information. She said you want cash tips every day or you want me to pay $7.25 an hour and you get your money ONCE a month? With a smirk. I was helpless because at the time my financial situation was rough. I accepted 60% cash tip of what I really earned because it was fast. She wasn't even aware that NC law allows resturants to keep 15% of server tips. So she lied and said \"IF YOU WANT TO WORK UP TO 85% OF TIPS.\" Whereas before she said you have to work hard to get 100% of tips. Tips come out of pocket from customers so they didn't EVEN pay me minimum wage. I promptly quit and never looked back. I AM STILL CONSIDERING TO GO TO NC LABOR DEPARTMENT. So if you are a customer, you're supporting this. Stop going there, please!!!!!

You may also think, this guy only has 1 review, maybe its a fake review from their competitor. WELL I can tell you that I worked there in 2013 after my business died. I was taken advantage of. The guy manger was surprised I spoke fluent English. I've wanted to write a review for so long but didn't due to fear of physical retribution. (Vietnamese Mafia). Oh. the owners also SMOKES AND DRINKS AT THE BAR after closing. BUT Trump won the election and no one can live in fear for the rest of their lives. I've told all my friends not to go there unless you want to get food poisoning. Check some other reviewers about that!

PS. Don't think that it has changed. My friend went there to work. I told him the experience. He said he didn't care because he never had server experience and was prepared to be taken advantage of for training. He confirmed he was paid $10.00 for 6 hours of work on his 1st day. This was in 2014. NO TIPS. He ended up quitting and making $150 a night at a sushi restaurant. And to the reviewer that doubts I'm a college graduate, contact me. I'll show you my degree. No doubt I'm working in a large corporate company now, using my degree."}
{"text":"WF puzzles me! Nice decor, accommodating host (owner) but \"old style\" food. I got the feeling that we went back in time, say the 80's where everything tasted the same. Soup & sauces all had that cornstarch flavor that covers the tongue at first sip & stays with you throughout the meal. Their won tons in brown sauce must be an acquired taste that we haven't acquired yet. We also had the whole fish w/brown sauce on the side. It was over cooked & the sauce was more soy like than smooth. Both lacked flavor. The shrimp dish was bland & they used button mushrooms that they didn't bother to cook. I really wanted to try the fried bananas but chickened out!
All in all, not a stellar outing..."}
{"text":"This is our go to place in South Charlotte for takeout Chinese.  Always fresh, well prepared, quick service and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this is probably the best and most consistent Chinese restaurant I have eaten in Charlotte. I've lived here 8 years and still can't find a place as good as this. I've been here many times when I used to work in the area and the food is always good. Doesn't matter if it;s lunch or dinner, peak or off peak times. Ev everything here is very good. They don't have their own special meal that makes you want to come here, just excellent quality Chinese food with terrific service. I actually drive 20-30 minutes out of the way to come here sometimes."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Wan Fu in October of 2016 after finding another Chinese takeout restaurant nearby closed and scrambling to find something else.  Wan Fu has great reviews on Yelp so I was looking forward to some good Chinese food, which has proven difficult to find in Charlotte in my 10 years here.

My barometer for comparing Chinese takeout is tofu with vegetables in a brown sauce.  It allows me to judge how well a restaurant can stir fry vegetables, which is more difficult than stir frying only chicken, such as General Tso's.  

Wan Fu's tofu with mixed vegetables in brown sauce was very disappointing.  The tofu was great (it's hard to mess up fried tofu), but the vegetables included yellow squash and baby carrots that were way over cooked and thus limp and mushy.  The sauce was watery, as if some of the vegetables were frozen.  There wasn't much taste to discern in the sauce other than bitterness.

For $11 for a basic tofu dish, Wan Fu isn't worth the visit."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of Wan Fu over the last 10 years and I must say last nights experience was pretty bad.  Christmas Eve, I get it that it's going to be busy and as usual I called for a reservation because it's the polite thing to do and I hate waiting. I called a bit late and they only had 4 pm open.

Me and my party got there at 4 which turned out to be their opening time.  I was greeted by the Manager who is always there.  He was nice as always and we were promptly seated.  Table of 6 which included a booth for 4 and a table set alongside.  A little uncomfortable but no problem.  The server who waited on us has been there for quite a while and has waited on us in the past.  We ordered an appetizer for the table of lettuce wraps and she basically told us that because of it being Christmas Eve the appetizers were going to come out with our entrée.  She explained it in her broken English and I thought she meant that the kids meals would come out with the appetizers which is what I wanted anyway since my kids take like 10 years to eat a meal.  

Our lettuce wraps show up and so do about 10 other plates which included our entrees, rice, kids meals.  You couldn't see the table there was so much food. My # 1 pet Peeve at a restaurant when they cannot time the food properly enough to give you time to enjoy the food. I was pissed!  Chinese food doesn't take that long to cook and it was like a race for us to spend our money and get the heck out of there.  So, I and the rest of my party scarfed down our food and before I knew it while the pit was forming in my pre Christmas Day stomach the check was handed to us and we were basically being shown the door so they could get the next party in.

I told the Manager about the experience and he explained that it was because of the \"circumstances of the evening\".  It was 4:00 and they were not busy at the time and I, being a long term customer don't appreciate being hurried when there was no reason to do so, except for the fact that you can't manage your kitchen.  If you can't handle it, don't open the effin restaurant.  

Wan Fu better open their eyes up to the reality that there are other options out there and you don't get repeat business, especially from long term customers by providing them crappy service.  I don't care how good your food is.

Goodbye Wan Fu......"}
{"text":"We have been coming for 10+ years and have enjoyed our visit up to now. Same décor which we like but a new menu. The new menu is laminated with that \"fish camp\" design to it....cheesy. No longer are available are the Thai spring rolls with peanut sauce. Hot and sour soup still excellent. Smaller size portions are the pork fried rice (also excellent) and the bang bang shrimp now has fewer shrimp, less broccoli and LOTS of red onions. Coral chicken is very good. sesame shrimp is smaller size but still excellent. Menu description is poor though. Looks like they are cutting back on size and ingredients"}
{"text":"The only place in Charlotte where we dine in for Chinese food. Affordable prices and great food! Favorite dishes here are the emperor shrimp and shrimp in tamarind sauce (not on the menu). Ruby red deep fried snapper is crispy and is covered in a spicy/sweet sauce. Shrimp and scallops is mediocre and nothing really special. House special fried rice has great flavor and texture. Fried frog legs were mediocre as there wasn't much flavor. Beef with Chinese broccoli is standard and good as well."}
{"text":"to be honestly i won't be there again unless it's friends-get-together, the food is just at average level and the portion is small, and the price doesn't look good."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant.  I just wish we lived closer!  The ingredients always taste so fresh."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese restaurant in charlotte. Love the place! Try the pork with fried bean curd and make it on the spicy side. One of my favorites. Service is nice, too. Can't go wrong here. If you want chinese don't settle for those americanized chinese place. Come to Wan Fu!"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent wait staff, busy during the holidays so book ahead."}
{"text":"Great food!  Good spot for large groups...  I've gone plenty of times to Wan Fu either on dates (yes, I do go on those) or with large family groups.  The last time was with family friends and we were able to occupy a semi-private room.  I am told that they have a party room upstairs for larger parties of 100, the room doesn't have any windows so I don't really know what the ambiance would be like... the food would definitely be the star attraction (as usual).

The best way to go is a large group of 6 and then order away... the lazy susan will help you int he middle of the table to fix your plates family style :)

Favorite veg is the Chinese broccoli, hands down... but there are many other tasty dishes on a large menu.  The food comes quickly... you eat what you desire... and you take home left overs!"}
{"text":"I just visited today and had to update my rating. They get bumped up to 5 stars.

I'm recovering from some oral surgery and figured Chinese would be a good soft option for lunch today.  Plus I was craving hot and sour soup.

The staff is wonderful here, friendly, attentive and they don't frown on my special request of \"no rice\".  Like who besides me goes to asian restaurants and doesn't order rice?

Anyway, today I had the Garlic Chicken without the rice and hot and sour soup.  The hot and sour soup was just that - hot in temperature and spice level and a wonderful flavor that I savored as long as I could.

The garlic chicken came out and the chicken and veggies (peppers, broccoli,onions, water chestnuts) were all tender in a very savory but not overpowering sauce with just a little kick to it.  

Many chinese restaurants don't do spicy dishes well but Wan Fu hits it just right.  In fact, everything is perfect here...the decor, the soft music playing, the lighting. the staff, the prices.  

Oh yeah, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is like Baoding in the South park area except more expensive. You can get pretty flavorful traditional Chinese dishes if you know how to ask for it. Other than that I think it is standard American Chinese food. The ambiance is nice, it really makes you feel like you are inside a Chinese palace of some sort. Ample parking spaces, generally alright servers. Come here if you are nearby and are eating out with friends but do not want a hole in the wall Chinese place. Also come here if you want more traditional Chinese food!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I had lunch at Wan Fu today and we absolutely loved it. Greeted pleasantly by Wan Fu staff we automatically felt relaxed and welcomed. The ambiance and cleanliness of the restaurant is exceptional. We had multiple servers who were always attentive to our every need and continued a steady stream of free refills of our beverages. When I saw the Steak and Shrimp with Asparagus on their website prior to visiting I knew that this was one of the meals I desired. The picture did not let me down as the meal itself resembled the image and the mouthwatering morsels of tender beef and prawns were accompanied by perfectly cooked asparagus that had a beautiful stir fried crunch with every bite. Velvet Corn and Chicken Soup for entree was the perfect place to start. Asian Shrimp and Scallops, so tender and juicy, formed part of our main. Everything was perfect and I look forward to our next meal at Wan Fu."}
{"text":"Where have I been?  Why haven't I been here before?  This is Chinese food like I had as a child complete with the Fu Dogs and dragons and pretty plates and dim lighting.  We visited today for lunch and it just could not have been any more perfect.  This place gets it, the service was great, the food was perfect, the setting was great, the timing was great...  I just can't say enough how on point these people are.  Stop with fast Chinese delivery...  get into your car and drive to this parking lot and go inside.  Sit and enjoy your food slowly because, yeah, it's that good!"}
{"text":"The first thing that you will notice is that the building is in something of a pagoda-style. Or maybe it's a temple. Whatever the case, it is definitely not your usual strip mall Chinese. Once inside, it's almost serene. Absolutely different, and it certainly adds to the ambiance of the place.

Like Panda's Den, the waitstaff really knows how to work the room. One will take your order for drinks, another will take the order for food, and then they just keep coming. For example, when my wife's glass went empty and she switched from soda to water, no less than three different people asked if she needed more soda. That's not a bad thing, it's just showing how on top of things they were.

After ordering our lunch special, it came out quickly - of course, many Chinese places will serve lunch combinations quickly, so that's not a terrible surprise. What was impressive here is that the ingredients seemed to be very fresh. Not just unrecognizable lumps of chicken, but balls of chicken and cuts of beef, well-seasoned as we had ordered it (even spiced as requested).

The only real complaint on the food was that the sauce was perhaps a bit heavy, which tended to overwhelm things a bit much. The good news is that the sauce is well-flavored, even if it is perhaps on the heavy side.

I also ordered brown rice and received white rice, but that's not a huge deal, as I really don't care too much, but it is something to watch for if you go and care about that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and excellent service. Crab rangoons were crispy and light. I don't remember what dish I got but it had steak, chicken and shrimp and it was spicy and delicious! Large portions. Fluffy white rice. Clean restaurant. Tucked away so hard to see from 51 but I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! you can switch around meats at no charge, ie dark or white chicken."}
{"text":"I have lived near this place for years and never ventured in well that changed once I got a coupon BOGO lol This is my new place for pineapple chicken and shrimp best  I have ever had.  They carve out the pineapple put the chicken, shrimp in it on its side.  I cant wait to go back. The staff were so nice even though we came in 45 mins before close. My friend  had the beef and asparagus mmm"}
{"text":"We came here with a LivingSocial deal in hand, so I expected a type of service which happens in some restaurants when you inform them of that when you order.  However, they were very much professional and polite after a bit of a wait on Saturday evening, which is to be expected now.

The funny thing my wife noted was, never has she seen an Asian restaurant be so slow.  Coming from NYC, we are used to waitstaff coming before you're even ready to order and almost pushing you out of your seat to let the next group of diners in!  It must be the south.. We waited over 5 minutes before someone even offered to take our drink orders and so we went ahead and ordered food to not risk another wait before she takes our food order.  Plus, go ahead and ask for your check in advance since they seem to batch all the checks and you'll wait for that as well.

On the positive, the food was delicious, definitely worth it for the portions, but I think I would come back more often if it was a dollar or two less per dish.  We had the General Tao and Basa Fish with Basil Leaf and brown rice.  Very tasty and we had to force ourselves to stop eating, so we only saved enough for one serving of leftovers the next day. The brown rice was also nicely cooked, not too soft and not too hard.

I didn't like the Velvet Corn and Chicken Soup.  It was like an egg drop soup with little bits of chicken and corn, not substantial enough for the price.

Overall 4 stars, but speed of service would be 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Best Chinese place in Charlotte! Wan Fu has been a family favorite of ours for a while and for good reason. Great quality, variety, and service. The decor is also beautiful. The fried dumplings are our fave!"}
{"text":"So far, this is the best Chinese I've had in Charlotte. I came here at the recommendation of a Chinese coworker who recommended this as one of only two restaurants she considers to have quality Chinese food (the other was the restaurant in Grand Asia Market which is recommended for the most authentic Chinese cuisine experience).

I came on a Saturday night to place a to go order (good thing I didn't heave my heart set on dining in; it was a 40 minute wait!). The interior was marvelous - very classy dining area with curtains, red tablecloth, and the lanterns. I'd ordered the gai lan (Chinese broccoli) with garlic sauce (their menu indicated spicy but I was actually informed not really; they gave me some extra chili sauce though) and a side of vegetable rolls covered in a peanut sauce. The quality of this place is definitely a step above the normal Chinese fare that Charlotte offers (their website boasts not using MSG or trans fat oils), and I wasn't waiting too long for my food either. Worth the trip and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese food in Charlotte. Hands down.  Service and attention to detail is  phenomenal.  Food is always fresh and I've tried most of the menu and have not been let down ever.  I will not go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food.  Costs a bit more but it's worth it in my opinion.  For instance, I had shrimp lo mein.  It was a large portion , the shrimp were abundant, large and devained.  Now I only know of one other place that does that and it's a whole bunch more there (P.F. Chang's)."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting 1 hour 40 min.   They told us when we checked in we would have a 40 minute.  When we left they thought it would be 20 more minutes.  Tables were sitting empty but not cleared.  Very difficult to get a status.  Lobby was packed.  

I would leave zero stars if it was possible.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wan Fu is probably at the top of my list when I think of Chinese food.  You can't help to get excited when you see the oriental inspired architecture on the building.  The interior is accented well with decorations.  There is a small bar in the lobby if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table.  However, there is normally not much of a wait.  

The food is a little on the expensive side for a Chinese restaurant but it is worth it, in my opinion.  If you go there for lunch the food will be a little cheaper but you will be served lunch portions.  You can do to-go here and you do not even have to go inside.  There is a drive-through window in the back.  I have never used the drive-through window but I am sure you have to call it in first.  

The cold noodles appetizer with peanut sauce is well portioned and comes with bean sprouts.  I am a sucker for bean sprouts.  However, The thing that makes this Chinese restaurant unique and stand out from the rest is that there are a few plates here that they will bring out on a sizzling plate.  I got the sizzling beef and my fiance got the surf and turf, both of which come on a sizzling plate.  The sizzling beef comes with mushrooms and a brown sauce and the surf and turf comes with mixed vegetables.  The thing about the sizzling plates is that the sauce will boil on the plate and concentrate into a delicious paste.  We both ordered brown rice which they brought out in a covered bowl for us to share.  If you want to keep a low profile at this restaurant do not order the sizzling plates because everyone will be looking at you wishing they had ordered that.  Next time I will try something else but it is definitely worth the experience to get.  

WanFunderful."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in Charlotte is actually in Pineville. Wan fu is that place. There is a reason it has been around for so many years. It stays busy as well. Szechuan wontons are perfectly balanced, sweet spicy peanut sauce. The sweet and sour chicken is very good as is the general Tao chicken.  Garlic chicken/shrimp and the firecracker shrimp are some other favorites. We frequent here as much as possible. It is a few dollars more than your strip mall Chinese restaurant, but well worth it.  The lunch specials are good deals, they come with a spring roll and are significantly cheaper than the dinner prices. These specials are available on weekends as well.  The spring rolls are the best I've found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wan Fu is excellent. The food is atypical of your usual Chinese restaurant. They serve an outstanding variety of Chines food. Nothing here is common place.
The service is marvelous."}
{"text":"Excellent place here. Food was traditional Chinese, though they also have some Americanized variety here as well. Wide selection of food. Pot stickers, mushi pork (not on the menu, you have to ask for it), and beef chow fun are just a few of the items to choose from. This is actually the first decent Chinese restaurant we have visited since moving here 7 months ago. Decor is elegant, service was excellent as well. Parking is plentiful and location is great. We will definitely be back for more soon."}
{"text":"We visit North Carolina at least once every couple of years. And without fail we always get something from here. Their Emperor shrimp is the best that we've had anywhere in the country. And that says a lot because we travel throughout the year across the states. If you're in Charlotte this is definitely a place you should try."}
{"text":"I don't just \"toss out\" 5 stars without giving it a lot of thought. A restaurant has to do everything perfect with no flaws. Well on the way home from Wan Fu my wife and I went over every aspect of the meal to see if we could find a flaw and we couldn't. 

For starters the building is quite impressive from the outside, and inside the decorations seemed very tasteful and the whole place had an \"old school\" Chinese restaurant feel even down to the music. I grew up in Charlotte and am old enough to remember The Dragon Inn, The Oriental, Ding Haw, and Ho Toy, and had, for some reason, recently been missing that style of sit-down, full-service Chinese restaurant. 

Thanks to all the \"Yelpers\" that recommended Wan Fu

The appetizer was a spectacular start. We had the pan fried dumplings. Obviously house made, they were plump little purses of very flavorful and tender pork filling. The wrappers were so tender and good that I considered getting a second order.

Entrees were seafood chow-fun and tangerine beef. Neither disappointed. The shrimp and scallops in the chow-fun were big, plentiful and perfectly cooked, still plump with a nice sear. Noodles were nice and wide and so flavorful. Even the bean sprouts were great, they obviously use top quality fresh ingredients. The tangerine beef was even better, crispy, perfectly cooked small slices of beef in the most heavenly flavorful sauce you can imagine. My wife is from NY and said that this is the best tangerine beef she had ever had. Spice level was perfect, not even the broccoli and carrots were left on the plate. 

prices were not bad for what we ate, and the little plate of fortune cookie, almond cookie and orange wedge that came with the check was a nice touch.

We will be back for sure, I can't wait to try the hot and sour soup"}
{"text":"This place always seems busier than the parking lot would suggest, which makes sense once you've been there and seen the quality.

Their service is fantastic. I have been there a number of times and have never had a single issue with waiters or staff, they are incredibly nice and accommodating.

They have a huge menu with many options. On a recent trip I found out they will try to make a menu accommodation if you ask (in this case, someone said they wished they had sesame scallops and the waiter told her they could do that, and they did). Personal favorites are their sesame beef (the best I've had anywhere, hands down), shrimp and scallops, honey chicken, and sesame tofu. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"A quiet, hidden restaurant in a nice part of town.  The restaurant itself is huge!  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a sweet woman, who assisted me with my take-out order for lunch.  I ordered plain lo mein with water chestnuts, so a plus that they have water chestnuts.  I also ordered extra sauce, which they accommodated nicely.  A lot of times, for some reason, it is hard to get extra sauce.  They do not have eggrolls and on this day, I REALLY wanted an eggroll.  But that's ok, I survived. They have spring rolls that I've heard are delicious, just not my thing.  My lo mein was very good.  I had chili hot sauce to go with it, which I enjoyed.  Overall a pretty good experience.  A very quick order for lunchtime goodness."}
{"text":"Back in the day, when the jewish half of my fam ate dinner together on Sundays, it was invariably in ornate chinese foodhalls like this. You know, before Chinese fast food existed. Pre Bistro-Asian. When it was classy to eat lo mein.

Dark lighting. Lots of carving. Good, if demure service. Large menu, with all the Chow Mein hits and a couple of oddities: 

Gai Lan served with any number of proteins (mostly dried mushrooms). Only place I've seen it in CLT.

Vegetable Shell - tofu skin stuffed with veggies (again, mostly dried mushrooms) over spinach in a light brown sauce. Good.

Almost MaPo Tofu - minus the all-important sczechuan pepper. Minus one star. Yes, I'm serious.

Oversauced is a good summary of the lettuce wraps we ordered, and I wouldn't again. Cornstarch killed it for me. Overuse of canned and dried \"delicacies\" works in some dishes (Vegetable Shell) but not others (Veg Lettuce Wraps, as I said) . But for me, it all reminded me of my first food adventures - eating dim sum and shark fin soup at 8, biting into my first baby corn or water chestnut, noticing how fun it is to eat something I'd never tried before. Throwback.  Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a great pick for lunch or dinner. Service needs a little help especially when they get busy during lunch!"}
{"text":"Good food....excellent service. They are super accommodating and work with your special requests willingly. I got Sa Cha shrimp and beef and substituted the shrimp for scallops....no extra charge."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting sweet and sour chicken - it made mine and my wife's stomachs swell all night. Hands down worst sweet and sour chicken I have eaten in my life. All the other food (San Bei Chicken, dumplings) totally bland and without any flavor. Expensive prices for trash food. First and last time going to this place! Really the worst Chinese food I have ever had... Also, service was sub-par."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is delicious and flavorful. I usually order sesame chicken and it's always delicious here. The only complaint I have is that it's always hot in there. Halfway through my meal I begin to sweat. Not fun. Other than that, this place is great."}
{"text":"People recommended this place as this one has been running the business for more than 10 years here. It is the best if you are with a group of people to order and share diverse dishes for Chinese food. 

4 of us ordered steak and shrimp with asparagus, general tso chicken, emperor shrimp and eggplant with garlic sauce. You can't go wrong with general tso in most of chinese restaurants. I specially liked emperor shrimp and garlic egg plant. The crispy shrimp and creamy sauce goes well together and eggplant was so tasty! Steak and shrimp was good but steak could be more tender. 

Overall, the food was great but the portion of each dish was not big enough. It will be better to order 4 main dishes and extra vegetable dish next time. Both service and food were great!"}
{"text":"We went...we loved....and we're going again!! It was group of six and from appetizers to dessert and be in no doubt that I tasted all that was laid before me was excellent with service to match.

Must try - The Ruby Dragon!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  The chef is a master at making the sauce for the dishes(none of the fast food Chinese generic sauces used here).  The wait staff is very attentive and professional.  I highly recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Tangerine Beef & the House Fried Rice.  I've been to multiple Chinese restaurants since moving down from NY back in 2012 and this is by far the best, most memorable restaurant yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant really has a great ambience! The music is Chinese and the decor makes it look like a pretty classy Chinese restaurant! For this reason and the good service in giving 3 stars. 

The food left me wanting more though. My husband had the 3 cup chicken, which to both of us was overly sweet. I had the bang bang shrimp which didn't have enough bang for me. It was very soupy and the flavor and spices didn't stick onto the food so it tasted pretty bland. We also had the velvet corn soup, which I also needed to add salt and pepper to. We got the fries banana for dessert- essentially a banana in in an egg roll, which I actually did quite enjoy. 

Anyway, cool place to go but the food was not up to par for us!"}
{"text":"By far, this place serves up the best/ freshest/  5 star quality Chinese cuisine! You can't go wrong at Wan Fu. I've been there multiple times and have tried almost everything and so far, I haven't been dissapointed yet. So why am I giving it 4 stars only??? The staff sucks! Like the quality of their food, their staffs placid attitudes also never fails to change. Also, if you have a Wan Fu coupon, read the fine print, it's quite deceptive!"}
{"text":"Food was sooooo good! Denny was a fantastic waiter. Enjoyed the atmosphere and great service in addition to the delicious food."}
{"text":"Only have eaten here one time and it was take out but the portions of food we're extremely fair. Wait time was quick and the vegetables and meat we're great cuts looking forward to come again maybe for dine in"}
{"text":"Wan Fu is by far my favorite traditional Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. Tucked away behind Outback Steakhouse on Pineville Matthews this is a place not to be missed. Our most recent visit was an early Saturday dinner after a long day of shopping. We arrived shortly before 6 and were seated promptly and served water and greeted by multiple servers. Within less than 20 minutes the place was packed. We started off with wonton soup and spring rolls. The soup was warm and hit the spot. As for the spring roll so light and fresh served with a mustard and sweet and sour sauce. As for the entrees we chose two to share, and unfortunately I don't recall the names, however, that will not hold me back from describing. We chose the duck pancakes, which are prepared table side, which I loved! The duck was sliced thin and placed in the pancake with onions, scallions and duck sauce. What a nice treat! We also chose the shrimp, scallops & chicken with broccoli.  The service was also extraordinary, as always, and I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  The food was bland.  And we left hungry.  I was under the impression that this place was really good because it always seemed packed and they've been there forever."}
{"text":"Gave Wan Fu a try after hearing/reading good reviews and my mother-in-law's request for Chinese for her birthday dinner. We were the first folks in the door for dinner (on the weekends they're closed 3-4p between services).

It's a very clean restaurant with three separate dining rooms to make it feel much more warm & intimate than the windowless exterior may imply. The menu's huge with most dinner prices falling between $11.95 - $15.95. Certainly something for everyone.

While portion sizes were above-average, I wasn't blown away by the quality of any of the four entrees we ordered. Singapore Rice Noodles with Shrimp & Chicken was the profile I expected and not something you can get at any Asian joint. The spice was particularly strong in a couple of spots and non-existant in others, so the sauce wasn't consistent. Wife's Hunan Chicken was General Tso's with a slightly sweeter sauce, and the Beef w/ Mixed Veg was what you'd expect.

Only bad part of the meal was Seafood Lo Mein. The scallops tasted like some combination of frozen, overcooked, and leftover. The shrimp in two of our dishes was fine, but those scallops left the literal bad taste in my mouth.

They were very accommodating for our infant son; probably not the best place to bring a small kid at the height of dinner, but a lunch or early dinner worked out just fine.

We'd consider going back but, personally, we'd likely choose going to Taipei South just down the road on McMullen Creek Dr 9/10 times... slightly smaller portion and a little less variety but also half the $."}
{"text":"Wan Fu... Wan Fu... what happened to you?

I dropped by the other day for some of my favorites, but to my dismay, found the food to be sadly lacking.  Honestly?  The meal tasted like it'd been made two days prior and left out on the counter.  Even the dumplings sucked!  They've changed something in how they make both the pork and veggie dumplings - they're folded differently and the dough is awful!

I hope they get their mojo back soon.."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best Asian cuisine in Charlotte. The menu is comprehensive, the service is pretty good and I haven't had a bad meal yet. 

It is great for take out too!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here on numerous occasions. My mom and I shared the fresh shrimp and scallops and our friends got the lemon chicken and beef and broccoli. Everything was delightful!! The service makes you feel like royalty and they're extremely kind and polite. I've been in a business most of my life that deals with sanitation and sterilization, and I have to say that I think this is one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever eaten in."}
{"text":"Very best.For a fine dining chinese restaurant, food and beverage is reasonably priced.  I think you get value for the caliber of resturant and quality of fare."}
{"text":"I tried Wan Fu back in August 2012 because of the rave reviews and friend recommendations. 

On the menu I noticed the prices are considerably higher than other Chinese restaurants in the area. Now, I understand that there's a difference between greasy garbage chinese food and quality chinese food. But even still, the prices were still high ($4 to $6 higher per entree). So I figured they must give larger portions than normal. NOPE, not the case.

Also, the food didn't surpass any quality of other local chinese restaurants. (I think Wild East is just as good, if not better. Great Wall is also a solid choice.) I just didn't see the $4+ per plate premium going anywhere. To top it off, a low sanitation rating... even for a chinese restaurant. I noticed this when I picked up my food. 

The food was good, not great. The hostess was very nice. The prices are unnecessarily high IMO. Overall, not worth it."}
{"text":"The first time I came, I gave 4 stars. Now I can only give 2 at best. Service and food was subpar; we had to send back our appetizer and entree because it was burnt and not as described. Maybe management has changed but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service . Dan told me there was nothing he could do for me and it's my fault my food was horrible since I haven't had authentic Chinese food. I left the food  there after spending 16.00. Left without any dinner . They took the food back and forth to the kitchen to examine it several times and then try to give me the same food to eat again. Told me I could speak with the store manager in two days about the issue. I will warn everyone about how disgustingly and tasteless the food here  is and there horrible customer service ."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with family. The service is always great and the wait isn't too bad. The food was very good."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I have found in Charlotte! Love the won-ton soup. The manager/owner always makes sure you are taken care of."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, quick service, reasonable pricing and a staff that is happy to help with whatever else you need. Also, when ordering take-out you get all of the above, the ready time is 15 minutes or less AND they have a drive-through window. It doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Superb Singapore noodle ! I grew up in Singapore and this reminded me of home. Great atmosphere and experience. Service was on point and friendly. 6/5"}
{"text":"The wait was extremely long because of a big group they had and we weren't offered anything while we waited which to me was bad customer service but when we finally got our meal which was only their pineapple fried rice and an order of Mongolian beef, it was piping hot and hands down the best fried rice I've ever had."}
