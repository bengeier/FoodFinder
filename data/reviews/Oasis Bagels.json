{"text":"I stopped in today as part of my routine when I'm in town. Being Mothers Day it was busy, but the staff handled the crowd and the business with the same great customer service that brings me back everytime! Great food, Great people, Great atmosphere! It's a must stop when I'm in the area.

Sincerely,
Vince"}
{"text":"The best bagels I have had in AZ ok service and very pricey I kind of stopped going for the most part just to expensive  Starbucks pricey"}
{"text":"We stop in here once a week when we bicycle to this part of town.

The staff is always super friendly and the service is quick.

I enjoy sitting outside in the early morning, even in the summer time.

Great bagels and hot coffee!"}
{"text":"Bagels are so good! I've grown up surrounded by Jewish bagel delis and Oasis most definitely hits the spot. I love their breakfast sandwich and the lox and cream cheese. Carol is a gem, Estrella adores having her and her business here. 
This is the go to spot up the hill in the morning. Never had a bad experience and we go there weekly."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE THIS PLACE AGAIN IF IT'S THE LAST EATERY ON EARTH FOR A MEAL.

Bagels were ok but the attitude and reception from the owner is a MINUS (-5) but that grading is not possible but definitely warranted for this Owner and her establishment.
I live in the Estrella Mountains and only minutes from this place so the wife and I frequented the store for weeks hoping to patronize local eateries and establishments. And one thing became very apparent each and every time we went there...the owner of the establishment completely ignored us. 

At first my wife and I thought maybe she was busy and didn't notice us, but being such a small place you get to know everyone relatively quickly, ESPECIALLY, if they frequent your business each and every weekend.  So we decided to say hello to her on one of our weekly Saturday visit to and see if we read it incorrectly and give her the benefit of the doubt, but sure enough she never acknowledged us at all.  Not even a smile!  But it gets worse... she walked passed us to greet another customer sitting next to us that arrived after we were seated. So I looked at my wife and said \"it couldn't be because we are a interracial couple, huh?\"  Oh maybe we were invisible or covered in manure... It just had to be something we ourselves could not see or notice ourselves.  I really didn't get it!

So we went a few more times because this just couldn't be the case in the 21st Century with a Black President.  Heck No!  Sure enough a few more Saturdays passed and not even a look in our direction.  

I truly wish I could express how I feel about such people but I want this message be read and the message get out that this is our discovery dealing with this store never to spend another dime with them again.  R.I.P."}
{"text":"Just go - bagels are phenomenal ! I along with my family are everything bagel lovers  and it's a unanimous vote ! Bonus - serve Coke  products not Pepsi so the deal was sealed ! 
Need to try the rest of the yummy baked goods but can not get past the bagels ! 
Great kind service - two thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Breakfast is really good with the bagel sandwiches. The spreads are really flavorful and fresh. Tends to get crowded inside, so you may have to sit outside. Not the fastest service in town, but worth the wait. Make sure and use the punch card every time to get your free bagel sandwich after 9 purchases."}
{"text":"Love this place! French Toast bagel is amazing if you want a sweet treat. My son loves the bacon and cheese omelet. It's fabulous that I can pick up some great bagels right in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great service and great bagel sandwiches, even when they are busy.  Wish I could be there every day."}
{"text":"This is what bagels should be. Great selection, great service and great prices. Never been here when it was'nt lined up to the door, but they get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Had a delicious pastrami sandwich on rye today. Sooooo delish. I can't wait to come back to try a bagel (which was my original intention). Cute and cozy little.spot with lots of outside seating. My kiddos wanted something from the baked goods case...but were too full. We have some more taste testing to do...a re-visit is in our near future"}
{"text":"I stop in regularly for a cup of coffee before I head to work. Honestly, this little place is just what I've been waiting for since we moved up here 8 years ago. Good coffee, delicious bagels and pastries plus a few other menu items. I'm always greeted with a smile and the staff is so helpful. The place is clean and photography adorns the walls. You can either sit inside or outside on the patio tables. Either way, it's always good."}
{"text":"Here is a real review of this place.  We were visiting family over Thanksgiving who live WAY out in Goodyear and walked down to the bagel shop for breakfast one day.  The bagels are GREAT!  They have very nice looking pastries (my son had a donut but I didn't get to try it because he ate it so fast).  I had their stock coffee which was very good coupled with flavored creamer.  The wait staff was very helpful.  They also have some great looking ice cream!  The place is cramp inside but the tables outside were very roomy.  I would definitely visit again next time we come into town."}
{"text":"Oasis Bagels provides amazing, good-quality food along with exceptional customer service. The sandwiches, drinks, and pastries are all very well prepared, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Must-eat for anyone in the Estrella Mtn. Ranch neighborhood in Goodyear, AZ!"}
{"text":"Great service great bagels. What else is there to say. Also don't forget to get a punch card. And ask what the specials are."}
{"text":"We love Oasis! Our family frequents to Oasis Bagels quite often. They have a very mom and pop small business, with fresh food, Boar's Head deli, espresso machine to make specialty coffee, fresh pastries and fresh donuts! It reminds you of home made breakfast and lunch! Made fresh to order, wonderful staff. They are always helpful to  one another and kind to their customers!"}
{"text":"Known for the best bagels around but they have a hidden gem with their other pastries, omelettes, and coffee beverages that will give Starbucks a run for their money. Don't miss out....explore the menu. Can't wait to try something new my next visit."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this place as we've lived in the area for some time.  We recently had a family member from out of state visiting us and he went into this establishment for us on a Saturday morning and had a very negative experience in that the  young man working behind the counter abruptly asked, \"What do you want?\" as our guest was scanning the menu options.  Our guest proceeded to ask a question regarding an item or two and got another abrasive and even sarcastic response along with a smirk and chuckle followed by \"Well are you going to order?\"  Our guest replied \"no thanks\" and walked out then proceeded to go to Safeway next door for his bagels.  Needless to say we'll never know whether Oasis has good food or not as the service and attitude was so poor we'll never go in.  We have and continue to work in the service industry somewhat and we know that the best way to protest poor service or food is not to patronize the restaurant or business."}
{"text":"Great bagels and delish  cream cheeses! I have to have my bagel fix at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come I am impressed. Nothing is better than waking up in the morning and eating a delicious bagel. Since high school I have always ordered the Choclate Chip bagel with Choclate Chip cream cheese with a coffee. This place will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Best bagels I have ever had and I am from NYC. They are so delicious and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels and breakfast sandwiches! Everything is made fresh in house as far as bagels and flavored cream cheeses. Coffee is good, but could be better. My only complaint is how small it is. This place is always packed with customers and there is very little seating making for little room between tables and the ordering line. Hopefully they consider expanding because they really need to!"}
{"text":"Oasis is a great little bagel shop located in Estrella Mountain Ranch.  On weekend mornings this place does a serious business with a line outside the door. Be prepared to be patient if going to dine in/take out during peak hours.  Oasis has a wide variety of bagels and cream cheeses.  My favorite cream cheeses are the veggie and the chocolate chip.  The everything and salt bagels are very good as well.  However, the star item sold here is the crumb cake.  The \"cake\" is moist and buttery and the crumb topping tastes like brown sugar deliciousness.  You must try this item when you go.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love bagels and believe me it's hard not to give this place a great review. They are very good bagels. But often times the staff are somewhat clumsy or distracted here. They have a horrible workflow when ordering, and there seems to be errors more often than there should. When it takes over 10 minutes to get a bagel that needs cutting and cream cheese, you can do better."}
{"text":"They fixed their bagels! Oasis returns to its top tier bagel status. 

New ownership from people who really care. Believe me, it shows in their bagels and pastries. Their crumb cake in particular is incredible."}
{"text":"These are the best bagels I have had! Made fresh daily and have great spreads from cream cheese! Coffee drinks are very delicious as well. I like to run a train on the chocolate chip bagel with the chocolate chip cream cheese spread...Nyum, Nyum, Nyum! Also, the steel cut oatmeal is so good it makes me want to rub it all over me:)"}
{"text":"If eaten here 4 times they are by far the best basic bagel place in Goodyear, AZ i'd say that you should definitely go here"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Estrella for fresh bagels, a variety of cream cheeses, yummy chicken salad all served with courtesy and smiles!!
It is an \"oasis\" in the desert for this foothill community, but worth a scenic drive up the hill for folks passing through."}
{"text":"Hear me out. This is the only place in the foothills that isn't a fast food chain, but damn that service and price point.

I've been twice and both times they have messed up my order. I asked for a Bagel with Lox (Lox is on the menu) and both times I've gotten back the bagel with salmon cream cheese. The staff looked like they were having a good time, but four people working and my bagel with salmon cream cheese took over five minutes, this is with one person ahead of me. Come on.

Maybe this is the AZ standard, if so, man, I feel sorry for you. I've just bought bagels at CostCo and make my own cause the service is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Love Oasis Bagels! The Napoleons are dynamite... The food is so fresh and the staff are always upbeat and fun! Goodyear is blessed to have them!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved here and expected, after reading some reviews here, that this place would be a great place to frequent since it is one of the few businesses in my area. The shop was nice and had plenty of seating but more importantly, clean.  A very young man tended the registered and offered his assistance. I glanced at the menu for a minute since it was my first time there and liked that they had a good number of options. A few customers popped in and out while there and they appeared comfortable as if they were regulars so that gave a comforting feeling. The young man wasn't that knowledgable about the menu after I asked a couple questions but lady there was close by to answer questions he could not answer. Placed my order and it was a reasonable price. A few minutes later I was happy to have my order in a bag and ready to go since I was in hurry. My fault, I did not check the bag to ensure my order was correct. How hard could it have been? I ordered a sandwich and a handful of bagels with cream cheese. When I got home, I noticed I had everything except for the cream cheese. Frustrating. Now I feel that I HAVE to check my bag prior to leaving.  :(  Maybe next time it will be a little better. 

Almost forgot. Order a small cappuccino and went to sip it when it dribbled down my chin. They didn't place the lid on all the way. Once again my fault for not checking. Maybe it wasn't my day."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the bagels are fresh and the schmears of cream cheese are on par with NYC. I especially like the turkey cranberry sandwich, they do not skimp on the turkey."}
{"text":"Holy Moses ! New York has arrived in Arizona! Never would I have believed that you could get a great bagel outside of New York but boy am I wrong! This place rocks! Simply the most delicious bagels anywhere in the states! The staff here is awesome as well. As a visitor here I was so impressed by their demeanor and wonderful warm welcome I received when I walked in. Everyone's greeted by name if they know you, or if they don't by a nice smile. That is something unique to here as you can't always get that in NY.  If you are anywhere near this place definitely stop in and get ready for a delicious time !"}
{"text":"This is the best local bagel place around. If you are from New Jersey you understand what a Taylor ham and egg bagel sandwich is. They hit a home run every time. Good people from the neighborhood stop by and say hello."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great cup of coffee in this area, step out of the crazy-long line at Starbucks in the grocery store and get yourself over to this little place just a couple doors south!

Menu looks great with lots of variety and rich dark coffee flavored just to my taste! This is NOT just bagels...who knew?!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for the past two years or so. Great bagels, sandwiches, and coffee drinks.  Definitely a nice place to have in Estrella.  The staff is friendly and I usually always see the owner (or whom I assume to be the owner) out and about interacting and working hard."}
{"text":"Under new ownership, but same awesome coffee, tea,bagels, breakfast,brunch .....I will continue to go here .....way better service and food then McDonald's next door ,don't waste your time at McDonald's ....Go to OASIS BAGELS they rock!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oasis Beagles is one of my top favorite breakfast spots to go! So many options to choose from! Plus, the beagles are perfectly heated, crisp outlining, and fluffy all around the inside. Don't even get me started on the toppings! Overall, great spot to hit if you're looking for either a breakfast or a quick meal option"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, great service and great value! I came here mainly for breakfast and really didn't think it could be better for lunch....man was I wrong! Their roast beef was amazing and paired with a bagel that is baked fresh in the AM....Mmmmmmm! I really love how friendly everyone is and the punch card makes me feel like I am getting something in return for being a loyal customer! Great addition to EMR!"}
{"text":"All time favorite bagel place. I love everything they have though. Coffee is great and it's never packed and they are quick at making your meal. I've never be let down :)"}
{"text":"Well tonight's dinner test run was phenomenal!!!! The ingredients were all freshly prepared and EVERYTHING was AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh bagels with real cream cheese. The vegetable cream cheese was the best I've ever had (real chunks of veggies!) Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Nice little sandwich and breakfast shop.  Certainly the best place to grab breakfast without going down the hill.  AND they have a Taylor Ham breakfast sandwich!  Pretty rare outside of the Tristate Area!  They used to be open just for lunch and breakfast but they are now open on weekend evenings for ice cream, sweets, and drinks.  A great place.  Definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Oasis Bagels is by far the BEST place around!  The owner and her staff are all outstanding.  They have the most AMAZING sugar free chai latte with almond milk!  No other drinks can compare!"}
{"text":"Love their bagels. And love that I can get Taylor ham there. Makes this jersey girl happy"}
{"text":"Say no to oasis on bagels.  Bagels were hard and they did not even cut them or give me any cream cheese.  I ordered over a dozen and the least I'd expect was for them to be cut and fresh.  Only thing else I've tried was their smoothies, and they were not what I expected."}
{"text":"Local bagel/coffee shop. Always busy-wait time could be a bit better. Stopped by the other day on family bike trip and had to wait ++ for drinks/food. Limited inside seating and some additional seating outside. Closes at 2:00PM wish they were open longer on weekends."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel place!! This is a gem in Estrella Mountain Ranch. Bagels are fresh and delicious. Best I have ever had. They make wonderful coffee drinks too!"}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave! I ordered pastrami with mustard and specifically  NO sauerkraut.When I got home what I had was pastrami, sauerkraut, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo. Bagel was so saturated with sauerkraut, which I can't stand, and onion had to throw a $10 sandwich in trash!! I called and they said \"sorry about that\".
My first and last visit!"}
{"text":"You need to try their coffee.  My favorite place to grab a mocha and bagel, there is something special about this place, the quality of toppins, bread and coffee is superb"}
{"text":"Love Oasis. Very friendly staff and good food. Great place to grab a quick breakfast and enjoy your neighbors."}
{"text":"Cult Bagelry

I'm a native New Yorker, now living in Arizona.  I grew up starting my day with a roll & butter or my favorite a bagel with butter. I know what you're thinking, the same thought I had, simple find a great bagel shop in Arizona and start your day right. 

Finding a ordinary bagel is easy, regardless of where you live. Finding a great bagel that's boiled, baked and given a generous schmear of  butter or cream cheese is tough in these parts, that is until I found Oasis Bagel.

 The bagels at Oasis Bagel are fantastic.  My favorites are the Onion, Garlic, or Salt. These bagel are everything a bagel should be.  The bagel's are crispy, chewy, garlicky, onion-y, salty perfection.

On my next I plan on trying a sandwich. Especially, after I found out that at Oasis Bagel they use Boars Head Cold Cuts.

If you're ever in the area and want to taste  delicious bagels, and expeirebce great customer service, stop in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you respect and desire quality bagels this is the place for you. Perfectly chewy and soft the way a bagel should be. The cream cheese options elevate the flavor combinations as well. Don't get the bagel egg sandwich. Just get a dang bagel and let it be magical all on it own."}
{"text":"Amazing bagels made daily with just about any spread you can think of. Love that you can make phone orders and pick your order up since they tend to be VERY busy"}
{"text":"I love Estrella Mountain local businesses! The employees are always so friendly and always try to treat you like a friend.. That is the case with this place! The lady I have had cash me out is always so nice! She always asks how I am doing and suggests items on the menu.. Just very impressed on their customer service. The food is great as well!! My favorite is the poppy seed bagel with olive pimento cream cheese!"}
{"text":"Oasis Bagels is the best place around for bagels and bagel sandwiches. It reminds me of bagels from back home, and the egg bagel is my all time favoritr. So glad this place is around."}
{"text":"Great coffee, staff, and prices! Nice find on our quick trip from LA. Will be back tomorrow morning on our way out!"}
{"text":"Fresh bagels with a variety to choose from, I think this place is fantastic.  Fresh coffee with lots of special drinks including cappuccino and iced coffee.

The bagels are awesome, they even have special sandwiches including my favorite of lox!  They have blueberry, egg, plain, gluten free, etc.  You can taste the freshness, make sure you get a punch card so you can get your free bagel after 9 purchases.  Very nice and a true joy to get good bagels so far up this mountain, instead of driving down the hill.

The service is fine, perhaps because we are regulars I feel we get better service.  But I think all the customers get treated well at this place.

The complex is growing and with the new McDonald's I hope this place continues to thrive since I am a sucker for small businesses.  

Plenty of parking, located right next to the Safeway and maybe next time I will try their gelato and Italian ice cream.

Yes, I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in Arizona!  Yummy sandwiches.  Great service...always smiling & friendly"}
{"text":"Love Oasis!!! The food is great and the people are super friendly.  The Oasis Classic is the best breakfast sandwich, but everything is yummy. You should expect a wait on a weekend morning, but it's definitely worth it. Or you can call your order in ahead of time, and they'll have it ready when you get there."}
{"text":"What a difference a REAL BAGEL tastes like!  My entire family, Including a high school and college kid love this place. So nice to have a quick and Quality place to send my kids instead of fast food. Lovely staff, great coffee, free wifi. All the bagel flavors are awesome. Try the almond cookies!!"}
{"text":"The BEST bagels in the Valley!  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner if you like. Bagel sandwiches are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to read some of these reviews...

I have visited this place at least 2 handfuls of times over the past year and I have never found the staff or the owner to be anything other than polite and helpful and happy to have me there!

The bagels are fantastic.. even my east coast employees agree
i often will buy a bakers dozen and spreads to bring to the office and they slice them and even bag the \"seeded/covered\" bagels separately from the normal bagels.

The jalapeño bagel is official and I do love the breakfast sandwiches.

This place is awesome and is a really nice addition to our little resort community.
If you are in Estrella, get some oasis bagels..  you'll leave happy"}
{"text":"You won't find better bagels in the West Valley! The staff are always friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is light and welcoming."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something......ya gotta go.  I know a good bagel when I eat one.  Top it with some imported pork roll from Jersey...... it's a gunna make you say mama Mia!!!   Fresh and delicious. And the staff make you feel at home.  Every order tailored to you taste.  The staff are very friendly and the owners are a hoot.  YA GOTTA GO."}
{"text":"Amazing gem in EMR. Good food, good prices. Love how they employ local kids to run the shop. Free wifi helps you out. Feel free to spend a couple hours working here over a bagel and cup of coffee. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow...We feel so fortunate to have this excellent bagel shop in our new neighborhood...great flavored cream cheeses...bagels and breakfast sandwiches..can't wait to try everything...And the staff is SO FRIENDLY"}
{"text":"Fresh baked bagels are so good during the morning commute.  I pick the smoked salmon \"special\" on an everything toasted bagel most mornings.  Egg and ham on a jalapeno bacon bagel is also awesome.  Usually busy in the mornings is a good sign for a small business surrounded by competitors.   At 6 am there are more people waiting in line here than at the new Mc Donald's across the parking lot.   

Enjoy good fresh cooked breakfast and lunch and support a local small business - the classic win win."}
{"text":"Great bagels and sandwiches! Try the crumb cake and brownies too. They also sell flavored cream cheese. Yum."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Fresh food  & great  selections.  Staff  is  super nice.  Only  downside, space for seating."}
{"text":"Great bagels, yummy coffee, friendly service. The ONLY reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is they get slowed down significantly by only having one toaster. Sometimes it takes a very long time to get my order. Other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels!! Chewy and perfect. Got the everything bagel sandwich with sausage and egg. The best bagel I've had in Arizona. Sandwich had just the right amount of everything on it. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Truly one if the best bagels I've ever had. I found it unique that the flavor/topping were on the top and bottom which made for a great sandwich! We will be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Everything is authentic New York style. 
Selected them on Yelp, without knowing the dramatic change it would make in me and my husbands like. Is too much, 3 bagels in one sitting? NEVER!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's a great place to go after sport games,and they have fast service. They have great coffee,food, and of course, a variety of many different bagels."}
{"text":"The Oasis special is amazing! It's got sliced lox and cream cheese. The most important thing is that the staff are really nice, they remind me of visiting grandma."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Great food and people!  My husband won't get bagels from anywhere else.  The crumb cake is fabulous and they serve you a huge piece!"}
{"text":"I go to Oasis Bagels at least once a week, I wasn't even a fan of bagels and cream cheese until I tried Oasis Bagels. So, I ventured out recently and decided to try out Einstein Bros Bagels, you can't even compare the two.. I ended up going to Oasis afterwards. Oasis Bagels is worth the scenic drive up the hill. They have a large selection of bagels and cream cheeses (even gluten free bagels!!), the prices aren't outrageous, the food comes out quickly and correct. I always leave full and satisfied; If I could, I'd come here everyday for breakfast. Their omelets are pretty large, and always come out tasty and hot, the lox spread is literally out of this world (even if it doesn't sound like your cup of tea it is REALLY worth the try). I have nothing negative to say about this place, this is my favorite breakfast spot to come to. I hope that maybe one day they could move into a bigger building, but it's not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"Excellent love there bagels!  It opens early & it gets crowded, but that's because it GOOD!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. I read a recent review that feels they are racially biased. I don't see much of this issue as I go through my day, and I sure don't see it here. We are a racially mixed family, and the whole staff, including the couple that own the place, are always so nice to us. As for their product;  top shelf!  So nice to see others in the community embrace a locally owned place. Quality and friendly always wins."}
{"text":"My first time here  in a couple months after being out of town - always stopped in for breakfast bagel , chocolate croissant or the fabulous crumb cake - stopped in today for breakfast bagel - but no bagels - yes no bagels in the place - (Oasis Bagels??) no explanation why - they did offer to put my egg and ham on an English muffin or toast - not the same - I figure ok I'll have a chocolate croissant sorry don't have that either - the only thing in the pastry case was a half a pan of crumb cake and two donuts - at 930 am - I like to patronize the small business guy over the corporations ( McDonald's in the lot) but their not helping themselves - hope their problem is  just machinery breakdown - I sense other underlying problems"}
{"text":"I am for New Jersey. I know bagels. I have been in AZ since 2003. This place is the only place anyone ever needs to buy bagels from.
 They know what they are doing. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"great bagels, very good service, always fresh and a great variety of cream cheese  reasonable prices.  Sandwiches are good  bagels are the best way to go here."}
{"text":"I Love Oasis Bagels.  Most importantly they have great bagels.  unlike anything else you will find.  Good omlettes, and the chicken sandwich for lunch is my favorite.  I have been many times and find the quality to be always good.  A great part of the community and neighborhood.  Friendly people and a great meeting place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, staff is friendly and helpful haven't ordered anything here that I didn't love can get busy and a little crowded do to the small shop but worth the wait prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Great place to go for fresh hot bagels.  I love garlic bagels and they are hard to find.  But this place has a big selection of bagels to choose from.  My favorite feature is their rewards program where every 10 bagels you get one free! Dilly Dilly!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great bagels. Love the cinnamon bagel with the cream cheese. They slather on the cream cheese with is perfect."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome!  I highly recommend the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce on a jalapeno cheddar bacon bagel--don't forget to add jalapeno cream cheese.  Soooo yummy!!!  Carol and all the staff are amazing and are always willing to accommodate."}
{"text":"This place used to be great- great bagels and good service. Since the change in ownership they have gone downhill. Poor customer service, not as clean and food quality has declined. Ownership is rude and makes excuses rather than change anything."}
{"text":"The BEST bagels in the Phoenix Metro area.  As good as NY."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. My first experience with this place was a busy weekday morning, there were so many people packing into this tiny little place (it was clearly the place to go for breakfast in the community up here) it was a little overwhelming because there was a lot to look at that I just ended up picking out a couple of pastries from the glass counter so I could be on my way. 
The next time we were up here we were just stopping by to say hi to a neighbor but ended up sitting and talking with the owner and their big Italian family til they closed. They were so welcoming to two strangers who they just met, we talked, laughed, danced, it was hard not to love this family instantly and want to be a part of it, it really makes you want to support more local business owners like them who care and are really involved in the community. 
A couple days later, when I actually got to sit and comb through their menu, we enjoyed a wonderful little lunch. I really like that they have a lot of healthier options, you can customize your sandwich a bunch of different ways on different breads which is great for picky eaters.
I was still determined to try one of their bagels, they're from New York how could you not, so the expectations were set high that the bagels would be good. 
This morning I finally tried one and it was soooo good! Probably the best bagel I've ever had and these bagels are big! Not smashed or wimpy, lots of flavor without being too overwhelming. I'm cravy another one now.
I definitely recommend Oasis Bagels, they have a lot of options for everyone and ingredients that don't taste fake or overly processed. 
5 stars and 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Oasis Bagels is the place to go to have the best bagel you have ever eaten.  When I eat other bagels they just do not taste anything like Oasis'.  My favorites are the \"Everything\" and also the \"Cinnamon Sugar\".  The service is great there too.  The only reason for giving it four stars verses five is it is fairly small place and there are not a whole lot of tables.  But if you want the best bagel you need to go to Oasis."}
{"text":"Plain bagel, egg, pepper jack and Sausage... toasted. Garlic bagel, double toasted with egg and pepper jack. Yummmmmmm.... love this place."}
