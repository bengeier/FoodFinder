{"text":"Lindsey, one of the best servers in the city, (along with the rest of the Camino team) recommended the \"peanut butter taco\" it was incredible! This place never lets you down. Great food great service great prices. Thanks guys hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Cool space. Good service. 

(Bit slow though for lunch hour if you're with a group)"}
{"text":"I had the nachos and beef burrito...both were very good and I will go back again!"}
{"text":"OMG, I crave this place ALL THE TIME. It is THAT good! I am a huge fan of the Naked Burrito Bowls. I just went online and purchased a Groupon too :)"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. I should have known this place was going to nuclear bomb, considering it is right across the street from Tomo; the terrible sushi house I reviewed. But I decided to try it because of the reviews. But now I know, you have to literally be drunk, in order to enjoy this \"food\"

Now, I'm not suggesting that I have the palate of a world travelled renowned foodie, but dammit, I know canned food when I taste canned food! This place is the Chef Boyardee of Mexican Cuisine. From canned tomatoes, to canned refried beans, it made for a very bland, unsavory and unpalatable experience. I think the table, chairs and the silverware were canned too. Not suggesting that  canned food is bad; I grew up on it, but doggone it, THIS WAS SOME BAD CANNED FOOD!!!!!! 

Not only that, but they charged me for using a Groupon, charged me tax (expected), then charged me a \"pre-tax\" of $7.48. What the heck is a pre-tax??? I wish I would have taken a pic of the receipt! Since they added the extra money to my bill, I didnt bother tipping. The waitress was nice and checked on me often. But the overall experience of tasting this knock off, lackadaisical, weird canned food was extremely underwhelming.

 PLUG: Go to SENOR TEQUILA in Shaker Square. They have really great Mexican food, served and prepared by actual Mexican people, which makes for a delightful and more authentic experience. Heck, I'd go as far to say go to Taco Bell before going here. Yeah... Camino was that bad. I rate this with place 5 disgusted tongues"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat downtown!  Especially taco Mondays!! The staff is always super nice and the manager Lindsey always takes great care of us.  Oh and of course the tacos are amazing :). We came here on the night the Cavs won game 7 of the finals and had the time of our lives!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the lunch options in downtown Cleveland. Service was fast and the food was good. I had the Avocado Taco and a green salad. Both tasted fresh and light. I'd suggest ordering more than 1 taco if you're looking for a more filling meal... They are pretty small. I'll look forward to trying more of their options for happy hour or dinner sometime."}
{"text":"A friend and I had drinks here Saturday 1/2/16 and very pleased.  The place isn't very big tho.  We ordered \"The Momo\" and my lawd, drink was strong, but good as hell! Very well made! The bartenders were very nice!  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Have been to Camino twice and finally a place downtown that is chill, good food and different then a pizza, wing and beer joint.

Had both the chicken and steak tacos and they were fantastic.  Service was great, plenty of people to help us on the busy nights we were there.

Love the location, close to everything.

We will be back and bringing more peeps with me...can't wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. It's a hit or miss kind of spot.
The first time the food was fresh, hot, and flavorful. Service was spot on. 
Second time was ok, but I had no idea who my server was and had to ask random employees walking by to get my server (a different one showed up every time.) so I could order, get a napkin...a fork.. The redeemer was that the food was good and it was happy hour in the summer, but it was not a busy day. 

Last night we went for tacos and they came out COLD. We asked at 9pm if we could still order. They close at 10. That's clearly an hour, but sometimes it's an unspoken drink hour at places. 
The waitress looked at the kitchen staff and said,\" sure you can order. We have food.\" We ordered 9 tacos no sides. They took the normal amount of it to come out, but the entire order was dry, cold meat, and barely warmed tortillas. It was as though they turned off the flat top and warmed the food on the dying heat. Not ideal. We all had one bite each and out our food down. The waitress wasn't concerned with the food and nobody really said why it came out cold. I looked at the kitchen (open window kitchen) and the cooks were playing around, laughing, and cleaning to go home. I understand cleaning up before your closed, I also understand why our food was cold. 
I'm glad I didn't eat more than one bite because the cooks were running their non gloved hands through their sweaty hair, putting their hats back on and went right on cooking/cleaning. 

Cleveland needs to require food safety classes for all staff in the food & beverage industry. It's really disgusting."}
{"text":"Takes a lot for me to leave a review after a dining experience. Tried Camino for the second time last Saturday night (9/20/14) and left completely underwhelmed yet again.

CONS: While I have never been a firm believer in the \"every Mexican restaurant should provide free chips and salsa\" mentality, $4.95 for plain chips and a super spicy salsa is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy, but no advanced warning and at that price? Same goes for the guac. Only Mexican place I had to ask for the salt and pepper shakers because the guac was so bland. Bland guac and unseasoned tortilla chips = bad combination. 

As far as the entrees, not sure which tacos some people have ordered here. Put these tacos up against Barrio and they wouldn't stand a chance. Again zero seasoning, sloppy presentation and pray yours don't die in the window arriving room temperature if you're lucky. Have tried four different tacos and had identical results. Decided to try the Carnitas Burrito this most recent visit and same outcome. Unseasoned protein wrapped in a tortilla and smothered in cheese sauce. 

PROS: Above average beer selection for the area. Food comes out relatively quick.

Being a Warehouse District resident it kills me to leave this review. Just can't help but think that whoever drew up the plans for this restaurant should be disappointed in the outcome. Great location and potential. In all honesty, it would be an ideal candidate for Bar Rescue. Nonetheless, I don't see it being very long until this place closes and another attempt is made at occupying this space."}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times and always enjoy the food.  I love the Baja tacos.  My husband really likes the short rib.  Delicious food and great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and was so excited to see this place open. I gave it a couple weeks to get going before I stopped in. I wish I'd just kept walking... 
I ordered the ceviche. Mistake #1. It was absolutely the worst ceviche I've ever eaten. Served in a bar pint glass with store-bought chips in a Chili's/Appleby's type dish. The squid was the most rubbery-inedible thing ever, and the shrimp were definitely frozen. It tasted like they dumped cheap (also canned or store-bought) tomato salsa over some frozen seafood. Really really gross. I couldn't even eat it. 
My friend ordered 3 different tacos. His words exactly: \"They aren't anything to get excited about. They're too small and there really isn't that much flavor...especially in the meat\". 
Neither of us tried a cocktail, but if the food is any indication of the cocktail quality, count me out. 
I definitely won't be back to Camino, as I can find FANTASTIC tacos and drinks right across the bridge at Orale... It's a shame this place isn't better--downtown could really use a good taco spot. 
If you are in the mood for plastic/frozen food with very little imagination and poor quality ingredients... This is YOUR place. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I am a return customer of this restaurant and I can tell you that again, I was not disappointed at all. I arrived rather early and was immediately greeted by, Lindsey (made sure to spell her name with an \"e\"), who makes an awesome margarita by the way! I was meeting my best friend, who was running late, so Lindsey made it a point to check on me and helped me to not feel lonely, while sitting at the bar by myself. In the meantime, she served me a very tasty margarita and at that moment, I didn't mind that my bestie was running late. Well, she and I got to talking and I found out that I came in on a great night! Every Wednesday is Trivia Night. They also offer Margarita specials too! Hands down, they serve the BEST $3 margaritas in town (on Wednesdays from 4-7)! The Cavs were playing at 7:00 PM, so I knew, I came in on a good night! To accompany my tasty margarita, I ordered some chips and guacamole ($3) and sat back and relaxed in front of the tube. Their guacamole is so good, you can eat it by itself too! If you're not an early bird like most, the best time to arrive on a Wednesday night is between 6:00-6:30 PM. As Lindsey mentioned, between 6:30-7:00, right before the trivia questions began, it started filling up quickly! It didn't take long and in a few minutes, it was packed! Nice crowd by the way! Our other server, Khloe, not a Kardashian but very cool, served us a chilled raspberry vodka shot, which was very tasty by the way! Great treat for the ladies who like something a little strong but sweet going down! Hmm.. I leave that right there! Laugh out loud! Anyhoo! When my bestie arrived, she ordered the beef Taco Dorado ($4), which she exclaimed was, \"Delicious!\" while tearing into it. I ordered the chicken quesadillas to take home. Unfortunately, my bestie took them home by mistake and devoured them with the family! That's what happens after a few margaritas! Laugh out loud! Everybody gave them a \"thumbs up\" and said they were the best quesadillas they ever had! As for the trivia part of the night, it was a lot of fun! We met a very nice gentleman, who sat at the bar with us and offered his assistance and trivia expertise to \"win this thing!\" Just keep in mind, at first, the questions are quite simple. A piece of cake! As we continued to master the art of this trivia journey, we managed second place! Woohoo! And that's when the questions started getting harder! Certain questions we were all like, \"What?!\" And at this point in the game, the \"lightning round,\" the announcer does not repeat the questions! If you didn't hear it the first time, do what I did and wing it! Laugh out loud! Well, about three more rounds in and a few more margaritas later, we went from second to fifth place but shamelessly, we pressed on! There were a lot of serious trivia players in the building too! Shout out to them! All the participants made it fun for me and my bestie, total virgins to Camino's trivia hot spot! On behalf of my bestie and I, we'd like to say to Lindsey, Khloe (or Chloe) and the entire staff, \"Thank you for making us feel welcome and showing us a fun time!\"  We enjoyed ourselves immensely and really appreciated the friendly and awesome customer service from beginning to end! Kudos to you! We will be back! See you soon!..:-}"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the land. Yes, even better than Barrio (and I'm a big fan of Barrio). Hidden gem in CLE. Just got new tacos on their menu too. Must get tacos: Pollo En Fuego, Taco Dorado, and Baja. Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I can see myself going back for their great happy hour deals and the drinks... I cannot say more about the fabulous margaritas. They really put a lot of effort on those. The service and the atmosphere are awesome. I was really disappointed with the tacos though. They have good flavor but they are way too small. $3 tacos are not a great deal when you can find $3 tacos in a lot of places in Cleveland with way more ingredients and quantity. I would still try the other items of their manu but I really which they would have put more effort on their tacos. The pull pork was great but the chicken had three little pieces of chicken and a sauce... it looked like a little springroll more than a taco.

100% recommended for their drinks and I will try something other than tacos and perhaps upgrade my rating. Overall great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First time here the food was great, ,, I recommend the garlic parm wings. Drinks were good too,,,,"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I are taco fanatics, and when he told me about this place I instantly ran to yelp to look at the reviews and the menu. Once I seen the pictures, reviews, and the menu I was intrigued and ready to eat some tacos!!! We went on a Saturday night and I was less than amused. My boyfriend ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 1 taco and a quesadilla. He was not impressed at all. He had a steak, a chicken, and a ground beef taco. He said all the tacos were dry and that his steak was very very burnt. Which I was a witness to. They looked like little coal nuggets. He didn't eat it and rightfully so. Now with my experience.....mine wasn't as bad as his. I got the short rib taco and I can honestly say it wasn't that bad but, it was dry (no sauce)and the meat was kinda burnt too unfortunately. Now the quesadilla on the other hand was a completely different story. Those quesadillas were the best ones I've ever had, hence the 2 stars. The only down side was the cheese, it wasn't melted thoroughly. I had to take it home to melt it which was annoying but whatever. My boyfriend made his mind up about this place and he said never again lol which I don't blame him. If I were to ever come back it would ONLY be for those delicious quesadillas. And of course it would be a to go order."}
{"text":"IN LOVE!!!!!! Went there last night, not only was the service great, bubbly and made me laugh the drink selection was delish! It was Taco Monday and I had the barbacoa and was smitten from the first bite. 
Better than Bario in my opinion. Better flavor, better aptmosphere, and prices! 
Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Found on Groupon. Loved the fact that you can order anything from the full menu (minus drinks) that adds up to amount allowed in oppose to a limited menu option. Server that day was EXTREMELY nice, professional, etc. She explained the entire menu and drink options. The shredded beef empanadas are super yummy. The varieties of guacamole's offered is also a plus. 

Went a second time to pick up lunch with some co-workers, and ordered the guacamole, and they did not skimp, which I appreciated! Server was nice and accommodating.

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love Camino! Friends and I have been several times. The tacos are so fresh and fairly priced. I really enjoy their corn tortillas, not only because I can't eat gluten, but because they give an authentic taste. The other options here are just as tasty! However, the drinks can be rather pricey, which is why I am giving 4 stars. 
The outdoor patio is a nice place to sit and enjoy the downtown Cleveland atmosphere. There are other restaurants surrounding with outdoor seating as well so it is a fun experience.
The location is fun and close to many other bars and restaurants. The staff is decent. I really think the key to this restaurant is the food. Loosen up, order tacos!"}
{"text":"The happy hour at this place is amazing! You can get a ton of food for less than 20 dollars. Their nachos and steak tacos are phenomenal. I usually always get the same waitress named Haylee and she is the sweetest!!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced food and great service!  Empanadas were excellent (almost on par with Luchita's...but not quite)  Shrimp tacos were good and an excellent margarita.  A nice option on 9th."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Camino via Uber Eats. My friend and I ordered two burrito bowls. I didn't receive my bowl, and the bowl my friend received was inedible. Everything was soggy and mixed together and it was missing ingredients that we paid extra for. I called and they didn't even refund me the full amount for the missing order. My bowl cost $10.45 but they only refunded me $8.45 because we did receive a side guacamole. I had to call back and inform them that they separately charged me for the guacamole so they needed to fix it. The woman I spoke with said she'd call Uber \"for $2\" if I wanted her too. She also told me it was the driver's fault that the bowl we received tasted terrible. Unless the driver removed the cheese, mixed all of the ingredients together, and put it all in a soggy broken bowl, I highly doubt it was his fault. Needless to say I will never return because of the poor food quality and terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Meh, just ok.  The fajitas were very JV...refried beans were straight out of the can, the rice straight out of a bag, and the fajitas are drenched in some type of red enchilada sauce.  The beer chicken taco was greasy and the carnitas taco didn't look anything like carnitas.  Our red-headed server made the experience great.  Great beer and drink selection. Stick to drinks.  This place has some work to do in terms of food execution. I think if they would focus more on street-style Mexican food and nail the tacos they would have a home run on their hands. But the menu is too big and the food quality needs some help."}
{"text":"We love this spot! Great tacos! Monday's are our favorite but we find ourselves stopping in multiple times a week! We love the tacos, wings and burgers! Plus the margaritas and flavored tequilas are awesome. The waiters and bartenders are awesome and really take the time to get to know you."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of American spins on Mexican food, but I am a fan of Camino!

My friends and I, a party of 6 went for a late dinner on Friday night.  It was not busy at all, which worried me a little, but ended up being no problem. 

Wish I could remember our server's name, but he was a young, White man, and he was great.  Almost everyone got margaritas.  Mine was primarily lime flavored and well-poured.  The menu has a wide variety of food and drinks.  I got 2 of the basic tacos ($3) and 2 of the premium tacos ($4).  Go for the ones with rib meat and steak meat.  It was the best Tex-Mex I've had by far."}
{"text":"Okay, I've come here a number of times and feel like I can give a good review, as I've tried all their taco options and most other meal options. 

They make gourmet tacos here, it isn't Taco Bell and you aren't going to get overstuffed globs of beef. That being said, they have an awesome selection of choices such as duck, wild boar, chorizo and shrimp with siracha. They are all very flavorful and complimented perfectly with toppings. Monday's are the best, they are only $2 dollars a piece! The shrimp one is so spicy, it's perfect for that hot food craving. I have been to Mexico several times and can honestly say I like most of the tacos here much better.

Their guac is also outstanding, I really enjoyed the goat cheese one I had this evening. They don't give free chips and salsa, because once again, this is gourmet food, quality over quantity folks and it's worth every penny. So many bad reviews, I just can't believe it, and neither should you! 

In summation, if you want huge plates of crap food and free chips and salsa, go to don Pablo's. If you want artisan Mexican food at an extremely reasonable price, come here, I know I'll be coming back regularly for a long to go.

Thanks Camino, for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here today while in town meeting clients for lunch.  The fajitas were dripping in grease but were tasty and the chips/guac were the highlight of the meal.  Not the best Mexican I've had but certainly not the worst.  Didn't have a chance to try their margarita so I'd come back to try that!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has four stars. The nachos were soupy. SOUPY. How do you even make soupy nachos? They had some kind of fake cheese on them. They were really, really terrible. The chips were stale too. Stale chips! In a Mexican place! And the drinks were sugary."}
{"text":"The good: this place has very few EY people at it, and the food is really good. The happy hour specials are great, and they rarely run out of Tecaté. 

The bad: after happy hour it can get pretty pricey for the amount of food you do get."}
{"text":"We were planning a trip to Cleveland for a concert and found this on Groupon.  It's in a nice area, we actually spent about an hour or so walking around the city right after dinner.

The food was amazing!  Great selection and pairings.  It wasn't really busy when we were there so the service could have been better in my opinion but wasn't horrible.  Great atmosphere and I would definitely return when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Love the tacos and jalapeño margaritas are the best.... You need to go... Service was great and super friendly.... You mind yourself close you need to stop in"}
{"text":"Great specials! I always get the $5 quesadilla with a drink on Saturdays. Though the quesadilla is a bit messy, it is very good. Good chips and salsa as well.. salsa has a nice kick to it. Also, from an atmosphere perspective, it is a nice place to hang out. Very low key and easy to talk with your party."}
{"text":"Lotsa tequila and yummy food! Definitely worth the trip back for lunch while at work or for a good time after work! #tacos #tequila #yummo"}
{"text":"This was a great place to stumble into while on a business trip. The bartenders were kind and knowledgeable. It was like they were taking care of family. Thanks Cass and Lindsey"}
{"text":"Drinks were strong, reasonably priced, Tacos were delish, a little small get 3 instead of 2, but still very good! Service was attentive and quick. Great Place to chill and have some snacks and booze!"}
{"text":"Got the combination chicken enchilada, beef burrito and chorizo tostado, carnita tacos, chorizo taco and beer battered chicken taco to share for the table. I tried a bite of everything and have to say, I've never been so underwhelmed by Mexican food. No flavors stood out in any of the meals and none of the meats were seasoned. While they have a massive drink selection, skip the margarita. Also underwhelming. With so many other great Mexi places, I likely won't return here when I get my mexi and margs craving."}
{"text":"Went during an Indians game, me and the hubby expected it to be packed, the fact that it wasn't should have been my tip-off. we got there, they told us to seat ourselves and they would be right with us.  We decided to sit outside, i guess that was a mistake too because the waitress totally took 20 min to get to us. There were maybe 5 other tables so i know it wasn't a matter of them being busy, it took my hubby going inside for them to realize.

Fast forward, we got our menu, and a nice waitress she was really friendly. We started with the bacon guacamole, which to me was just guac with bacon chunks, hard bacon at that. nothing special, kind of bland if i'm being 100%. I've definitely had better. I had the 3 taco combo, with a shrimp taco, an taco dorado and a beer chicken taco complete with a side of rice and beans. FIRST OF ALL... the taco dorado was amazing, i got ground beef in mine, it was perfectly cooked, awesome! Next the beer chicken taco was awesome as well, the meat was perfectly seasoned, the chipotle cream was a perfect addition. I wasited to have my shrimp taco last because i had built up so much love for shrimp tacos i NEEDED this taco to blow my mind....boy oh boy...i wanted to fight the chef and waitress man. This was the most bland, disgusting, plain, horrible..i dont even know what else to say, taco. NO seasonin man. NONE! it was legit UNCOOKED, put together horribly, the taco was soggy and fell apart forcing me to drench the god aweful shrimp in some hotsauce to give it a kick. This legit ruined  my entire meal. to top that off the rice was bland too, uncle ben would be disgusted. the beans tasted like they came out of a can of old el paso. I was in shock, and a week later writing this review i am still in shock that a place thats a freaking TACO BAR can screw up a taco.

i wont be back based on the fact they really couldnt do a shrimpp taco correctly...like i cook better shrimpp tacos in my kitchen. at least add some salt, pepper, some cilantro...something.

hmppppfff!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! On Mondays they have $2 Tacos all night and during the week they have a Happy Hour from 4-7pm that includes half price apps and $1 off drinks. The Tacos are so delicious. I tried the Avocado Taco and the Flank Steak Taco and I wish I had ordered 10 more of each they were so good!! They just opened last week, so check this place out!"}
{"text":"I ate her a year ago and the food was awful. Overpriced and I just don't know how you can mess up Mexican food. I haven't eaten there since and the reason I am leaving this review is because I had a marketing sticker from them placed on my windshield which of course did not come off clean and now I have to deal with removing the remnants of this sticker from this Sub par Mexican restaurant. When I called to ask about it they claimed they don't ever place marketing stickers on cars and it was not them. Which makes no sense, why would someone just do that on their own? They could've handled it better. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but the little things matter in this industry and the way they claimed no responsibility when I called to complain made it worse. How is this place still open?"}
{"text":"Amazing neighborhood restaurant!!!  NEW BLT taco is the BOMB!!  Can't go wrong with Bacon!  Staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"EDIT: Original review below.

Wanted to update, as I went back to the restaurant, as one of the people I originally went with said they had really fixed some things - and he was right! It was happy hour on the margharitas, and they were delicious (and actually had alcohol in them).

I wasn't very hungry, but we had the chips and guac and was a huge improvement over the chips and salsa I had originally. My friends got a quesadilla and some, (can't remember the actual name) corn tortillas with beef and chicken inside. It all looked very good and freshly prepared.

Our waitress was the most attentive person I have had in a long time at any restaurant. She was practically running at one point to make sure everyone got everything quickly. Wish I knew her name so I could give her props.

Overall, I'll go back and try a lot more on the new menu and for the margs!


ORIGINAL REVIEW: ________________________
We were super excited for another restaurant to be opening so close to us in the Warehouse District. Tonight, we went to give this place a try. 

Walk in. Pretty cool decor. Open doors and seating with a bar and a lot of TV's. It was literally 90 degrees in there, and was really uncomfortable. I am not sure why they decided to turn the air off. Literally everyone was sweating, including the waitresses, and I could imagine, the people preparing my food. 

The waitress recommended the burger special and some wings that were on special. I ordered a burger with guacamole and some hot wings. Girl I am with orders two chicken and one steak taco.

The burger comes out and looks like something you get in a McDonald's happy meal with a few fries on the side. I took a bite, and the bottom bun is complete mush and is soaked in grease. The burger is grey. I eat as much as I can, but is one of the worst hamburgers I have ever had. Fries were what I can make at home out of a bag.

The wings come out as Parmesan Garlic (did not order it), but at this point I'm having a heat stroke and don't feel like complaining. They were, I would say, okay. 

Now, I know these are unorthodox items for a place called Camino. So, onto the tacos. Wow. I cannot even describe what came out on this plate. It was like 3 miniature tacos that were so soaked in something, and so mushy, she could not even pick them up with her hands. I tried both, and it all just seemed like stuff out of a can. 

I really don't understand how you open a BRAND new restaurant, and this is the food that was landed on. I would go here to drink a few beers, but will never make the mistake of ordering the food again. That is the only reason I am giving it two stars.

Apparently the reviewer below went to a completely different restaurant than I did, because we wanted absolutely zero more tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos at a great price. I love a la carte taco restaurants - especially when they have unique flavors like Camino does. I went with the beer chicken and steak. I especially loved the steak. 

To accompany our tacos, we got chips and queso, which were also delicious. 

The atmosphere was casual and eclectic, and there was a great, spacious patio. I only wish they didn't allow smoking :-/."}
{"text":"Hands down best wings I've ever had.  Big & meaty AF.  Also mexican pizza is solid with generous brotein."}
{"text":"The chicken was super tasty and the tacos are all good with reasonable prices, $3 each. Yummy drinks but are pricy."}
{"text":"Camino you are superb!

Sat at the patio with my mom today for a yummy lunch. Margaritas, chips and guac... amazing! We had the chicken enchiladas with green tomatillo sauce... delish! Hands down the best enchiladas we've had! Service with Cass was perfecto! She was friendly and attentive and made some awesome margaritas recommendations- the pineapple jalapeño margarita is a must!

Hands down yummy! Flavor packed menu - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is bar-ish, less restaurant-y. No problem though. The guacamole is fresh and delicious. The shrimp taco was rubbery and fishy which was a bummer because the sauce and slaw on it was really tasty. The tortillas (taco not chips) were too dry and ripped easily. The vegetarian naked bowl was basically shredded lettuce with a few green peppers- a less than average showing for a meal. The wings- my husband and daughter raved about. They were grilled not fried. A+ there. The barbecue sauce was smoky and made me want to eat chicken. The diet coke was NOT real Coke. All in all a B-. Pluses and minuses but I wouldn't not go back."}
{"text":"I visited Camino on a Saturday afternoon when there was a few events downtown. When we first arrived, it was busy but there were some open tables. We decided to take a seat at the bar. By the time we got menus, the place really started to clear out. The singular bartender was obviously busy, but it did take exceptionally long for her to take our drink orders, even longer to make them, and take our food orders. Clearly understaffed behind the bar, which wasn't her fault. We ordered margaritas and a few a la carte tacos each, which were just so-so. Taco shells tasted a little stale. Not much flavor. The side of lime cream that came with my carnitas taco was quite good, but couldn't make up for the blandness of the taco itself. Bummer. When our food orders went in, there were only two tables left in the entire place so I can't excuse the poor food experience on a high volume of orders.

Overall for the $20 bill per person, I was pretty disappointment especially for a place that calls itself a \"taco bar.\" Even more disappointed was my out-of-town friend who I was showing around Cleveland. I wanted to give her a taco experience other than Barrio... and Camino was mediocre at best unfortunately."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos great beer and tequila selection. The service was great and fast. Gotta check it out if your in town."}
{"text":"This is a great place and is exactly what the area is needed. The new duck tacos are awesome and the margaritas are spectacular. What I love most, though, is the staff and the owners. They take an active interest in their clients and really take feedback into account. When they first released their bacon guacamole, my wife and I commented that it didn't have very much bacon. A week later we try it and it's packed full of bacon. They want to create food and drinks that their clients love and are very open to suggestions.

They also just released a new menu and have many new items. They're willing to try new items, add food that works, and remove food that doesn't, which is definitely what you want for a new restaurant in the area. I've talked to a couple of people that weren't very impressed in the beginning but are raving about the place now. The updates to the new menu are spectacular like the duck tacos, burritos, and different guacamoles. I only expect it to get better.

Anyone that doesn't rate this place over 3 stars can't be helped. If there are a few hiccups when the place is starting, they will be taken care of when you're there by talking to management and will definitely be fixed in the future. This is the a legitimate restaurant that will be around long-term on West 9th and is very well run.

I highly recommend this place for regular dining, drinking, and the best happy hour in the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the perfect place for great Mexican food and is a cool hang out.  It's right in the great spot in the popular Warehouse District, next to Constantino's' Market.  I really liked my chicken & mango taco and my Baja fish taco.  The chips and salsa were perfect.  A perfect complement to my Corona & lime.  

We went on a sunny Saturday afternoon.  We choose a table close to the window to watch folk walk by.  

I'm recommending this place to my airbnb condo rental guests.

And to think the plan in the 70's and 80's was to knock down this neighborhood to make space for parking lots!"}
{"text":"Tacos are the Best way to go. Get either the baja, beer chicken, shrimp, duck, or barbacoa! Dont get a standard margarita, your better than that. Get a the honey tequila margirita."}
{"text":"So the positives are they have a patio, you can bring your dog, they do happy hour and it's in a nice location downtown. Cons would be pretty terrible service, the flavored margaritas were terrible and everything takes so long when they were barley any tables. 

There are plenty of better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"This was the first stop on self guided walking tour of the downtown area. Pick three guac - goat cheese, mango and arbol pepper and traditional. ALL VERY GOOD. Cocktails were delish. Loved the cocktail - a raspberry/jalapeno drink. Can't remember the name! Sit outside - it was nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great atmosphere. The short rib and PB steak tacos are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great specials daily (I posted a picture cuz they're not all online). 
The chicken quesadillas are amazing and the cocktails we tried were really yummy. Both worth all visiting again for. We've been here a few times because it has a nice ambiance, easy to find seats at the bar & with the food special a good value. 

The tacos were good, not great (and on Monday a good deal). 

But really we want to love this place. 
The only reason I wouldn't give it 4-5 stars is because the bartender was too busy socializing to give us much attention yesterday. I wanted to order drinks but I felt she couldn't be bothered with us for me to request the drink menu. (I would think the drink menu would be an automatic at the bar anyways). Hopefully it'll be different the next visit so I can update with a 4 or 5 star review!!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch on a recent trip. The place doesn't open 'til 11:30 am but they were totally fine with letting me in at 11:15 and having a glass of water until my friend arrived. 

I'm from Phoenix (Mexican food mecca) and mostly a vegetarian. The tacos looked good but most of them contain meat. I also have a palette of a 5 year-old so I'm not interested in excessively fancy food. I ordered off menu and asked for a bean/cheese/rice burrito and they were happy to make it for me. My meal was good - great value for the price - but not OMG I have to eat here every time I'm in town! (Then again, I have the palette of a 5 year-old.)

My friend had the street tacos and they looked really good. And the staff was great about keeping our water glasses filled - and thank good for that because it was a warm humid day."}
{"text":"Had happy hour at Caminos with a coworker and the margaritas were delicious! We had 2 drinks each, steak quesadilla, and tortillas chips. Everything pretty much was delicious-- then it was immediate stomach pain. I ended up with food poisoning and spent the weekend in bed. I saw my coworker Monday morning and she too had food poisoning. 
It's unfortunate because they have good prices and its in my neighborhood. I don't think I can have Mexican food for a while since I can't walk by without having horrible flashbacks :/"}
{"text":"I live right next door to Camino and it's one of my favorite spots to grab a drink and dinner. Their tacos are AMAZING and they have really unique margaritas. Try the steak taco, yum! I love this place."}
{"text":"Why are you not eating here now? Walked past a couple other Mexican options to try this place. The chips and salsa with a margarita are worth the \"price of admission\". Known for their tacos, I tried fajitas.    I had to ask for shredded cheese on the side but I can see why they don't serve it. The food is so flavorful. It is obvious they use fresh ingredients for their huge potions. I don't think I have ever tasted good Spanish rice until now. Great service and reasonably priced. 

This is also a nice mix of bar and grill. If there is a down side it would be the building is a little small. If this place was packed with people it could be a little unappealing."}
{"text":"When it comes to great tacos, you have many options throughout Cleveland. But, if you're looking for the absolute BEST tacos, you need not look any further than Camino. You can't go wrong with any of your choices, but the short rib, el pastor, steak and taco dorado (with chorizo and potato) are must-tries. Not only is the food great, the staff is exceptionally kind and accommodating, and even the jukebox is always on-point. Stop depriving yourself of this incredible gem of a restaurant and experience it for yourself. But be warned, you'll likely become obsessed.

PS - don't sleep on the choriqueso!"}
{"text":"Walk in - decent aura. Immediately expect the complimentary chips and salsa that you get at all great Mexican restaurants..... No-go. So that sucks. Really bad. 

Order the typical coronas... Can't screw those up. And they didn't. Check out the menu and get the chips and queso. Queso was honesty very tasty... The chips should have been homemade. They weren't. That made us sad. 

Service is marginal at best. Nice ladies. Just super slow. And forgot to give me my Baja taco.

Ordered the taco's. 5.5 inch tortillas but they are cheap so they were actually pretty good. I'll give a thumbs up to the tacos. First thing they did right. 

Now for the big question - the margaritas. They came in a stupid glass. Why don't I have a damn margarita glass. This is garbage. Not even strong to make up for the shittyness of the presentation. Come on bro. If you're gonna screw up everything else then why don't you at least make home made epic margz? Come on. 

Dropping the mic."}
{"text":"Just had the pineapple jalapeño margarita...oh so good! But you have to like spice!!! Empanadas are Delish! Half price apps for happy hour! Definitely with a try!  Will come back to try more goodies!"}
{"text":"Camino is my go-to restaurant in Cleveland. They offer an array of authentic, yet unique tacos that will keep you coming back week after week. My go-to tacos include the Baja, PB n Steak, Taco Dorado with chorizo and potato, and Short Rib, although I've never been disappointed with any of their other selections. They have awesome specials every day of the week, including half-off tacos on Monday, $5 wings on Tuesday, and $5 burgers on Thursday. And yes, their burger and wings (and all other offerings) are just as good as their tacos!"}
{"text":"Mehhh...Came here with my wedding planner after visiting some venues. Disappointing is not the word. I LOVE Mexican food - it is quite difficult to mess up in my eyes. Everything from start to finish left me underwhelmed. The chips weren't warm or complimentary (which is fine) The salsa was tomato paste, cilantro and lime... it left a lot to be desired. I ordered two veggie tacos and my friend ordered a \"plated meal\" We ate, we were bummed and we're ready to move on... Getting the check was the most jaw-dropping part. Chips, salsa, two veg tacos and a lunch meal $40. I felt I could have spent my money better next door at Constantinos. I gave it a try, I probably won't return - Sorry guys :-( I had such big hopes too because I love Mexican and your within walking distance from my home! (I didn't drink so I cannot comment on the cocktails or specials)"}
{"text":"Smelled fantastic! Was on a taco bar crawl did not get a chance to sample the goods. However earmarked to return and throw down! Can't wait !"}
{"text":"One of my fav spots downtown! I feel like I'm on my own living room with family... Friendly staff awesome food and perfect margaritas"}
{"text":"Without a doubt Camino is the best Mexican food in the area and the best deal for quality food in general in the area! Everything is clearly made fresh. Steak quesadilla is my favorite along with the cucupeno margarita, however I've tried almost everything on their menu and I've never been disappointed. They have deals on every day except Friday which makes them super affordable. Wait staff is awesome! My only possible complaint is I wish they were open on Sunday but that's only because I want to eat there every single day of the week! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"\"Not too bad\" is a good description of this place. It's a nice place to watch a game and/or grab a quick drink, taco, or phenomenal happy hour deal. The food is okay and service is good, but I think this place really thrives on the happy hours (which is probably why it is always packed at that time and empty at other times). I will definitely keep going back and recommend people chrxk it out, but if you're looking for some Mexican food to blow you away and make your day, you may not find it here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great happy hour deals, delicious margaritas and food (never got anything bad). Solid place to go after work. Enough said."}
{"text":"Food was decent, atmosphere is calming and can bring groups of friends to have a nice time. Decent outside seating, great for a nice day. Service is a little slow, if you ever are in a rush you will be late if you ate here. The servers are nice but aren't in a hurry to get you anything. 

Had cheese quesadilla with jalapeños, the guac was pretty good. Wish we were served chips, didn't know if it comes as a complimentary item or you have to order it. 

Overall 3 stars, mainly for the service."}
{"text":"I would like to give zero stars actually. Service was so shitty took over one hour to get our food. Will never return."}
{"text":"I just had the mango chicken taco and the tilapia taco. Awesome (once I added avocado to each).
The only draw back is the cooks speaks no English so the specialty burger that was ordered from one of my party had to be remade because it had nothing of the stuff that was requested and all the stuff that was asked to be taken off. The manager corrected it without charge so it worked out in the end."}
{"text":"One of the best new additions to the Cleveland food scene. Lots of tvs makes it a nice mix of sports bar meets taqueria. The espolon silver is an amazing tequila. The food is great. Of note is the spicy queso dip and pretty much any taco you want!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Prices are good and food is amazing. The Mexican pizza and burrito bowl are my favorite. They are on the CLEseats app so I saved 15% off the entire bill including all our margaritas!!!! And we had a few!"}
{"text":"The 4 stars is probably more for the ambiance than the food but a great place to hang out with a group of friends and watch some games!

They have daily specials inclusive taco Tuesday and $5 quesadillas on Saturdays. 

Food- For being a Mexican place the wings here were actually quite awesome. The tacos were good, not amazing, but fresh and tasty. They are either $3 or $4. I tried chicken mango and tilapia. Tilapia was only so so. Quesadilla (5 buck deal) was also pretty good. 

Drinks- were actually the most disappointing. Their house infused cocktails are NOT good and I would not recommended. Margs are however tasty and am a fan of the pineapple and jalapeño marg. For beers they have a good selection, and when we were there they had the seasonal travelers which was excellent. 

Overall would be back for tacos and beers during a game day! 

Ambiance. Great for watching games. Good service (slightly understaffed) but pleasant. Some it door seating as well

Price - reasonably priced esp"}
{"text":"I stopped in here this past spring (2015) to get a drink prior to an event I was going to and the couple next to me were raving about their drink and said I just had to get one.  Being one to submit to peer pressure, especially when it makes sense, I got the drink and they were right!  It was amazing.

The drink was the Cucupeno.  It definitely has a kick to it so if you don't like spicy, you might try something else.  However, in my mind, this drink was one of the most balanced spicy tequila drinks I have ever had, had muddled cucumber and a salt/sugar rim.

I have been dreaming about this drink since and long to go back..."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of all food I've had here - burgers, wings, Mac and cheese, salads, and tacos. The Mac and cheese was a particularly pleasant surprise, not something you'd expect from a Mexican joint. Drinks are great and service was fast and very friendly. Not too expensive, either. Very nice neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Service & location are very good although food was just mediocre in comparison to Barrio."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a party for my birthday that Caminos the staff was very courteous and on top of our every need had an amazing time will definitely look forward to doing business with them again again thank you Caminos you guys were fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Service (Roberta)! She's the best! Have to get the Baja taco and the PB and Steak taco. Great Quesadilla's! Those are the only two I remember having (thanks to the margarita towers) Absolute fire! Hidden gem on West 9th street. They have great happy hours and specials!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my trip to Camino for my birthday. The margaritas were plentiful!  We ordered a huge tower!  I really loved the quesadillas!  The chicken was so flavorful!  And who doesn't want bacon in their quesadilla?! Don't skip dessert here either! The churros were delicious too!  This is a little known spot that deserves a lot more attention!"}
{"text":"I am a fan and I will return, however our server needed to learn her beer list. 

I loved the atmosphere in this establishment, super edgy and different. I loved the prices and I loved their hours. The fact that they serve tacos for lunch everyday just captures my heart, unlike Barrio downtown. 

We ordered tacos to go and they were all delicious. I tried the Taco Dorado which is their \"house\" taco, super delicious but be aware of the fact that the shell is deep fried. I was told that the taco was just a hard shell not that it was deep fried. I also ordered the carnitas taco which was delicious. Our group ordered Queso and Salsa which were both so good! 

I will definitely return, I just wish the server would have been more prepared."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good, service was average, and the drinks were below average.  What Mexican bar doesn't serve frozen margaritas?  Also seems like every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to serves complimentary chips and salsa, but not at Camino.  Overall I thought it wasn't great, but not awful.  Like I said though, the food was very good."}
{"text":"Just arrived in town for the week and was starving. Happened upon Camino it was awesome! I enjoyed my Cadillac margarita and guacamole.  It also happened to be 1/2 price wing night. Can't go wrong there. So I ordered some bbq wings, yum. They hit the spot. Great find!"}
{"text":"Great spot for an after work happy hour. 

I had the soup which has chicken, rice, and topped with Avocado. If you don't like onions then don't get this soup because I found out the hard way...lol. Other than that, it's a flavourful dish. 

I must go back and try the wings. I heard they are tasty!!"}
{"text":"This place is sufficient if you're looking for cheap tacos and drinks. It has a sports bar vibe with large tvs. Casual, relaxed, and good service. The tacos aren't mindblowing, but they're pretty good. Plenty of options. No big complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. A Mexican sports bar? Not exactly but they have great TVs to watch a game. The food is fantastic. Not the run of the mill traditional Mexican fare. Awesome staff. It's a great addition to the warehouse district instead of a bunch of douchey clubs. \"Taco Tuesday\" happens on Mondays where much of the menu is half priced. Ole'!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I am from NY and I bought this as a groupon to try when I visited Cleveland Ohio. I went to MELT bar and grilled instead for the remainder of the weekend which was actually worth the money. This place made me nothing but NAUSEOUS.

First off, the waiter really bothered me. He was really rude and slammed down the menus. He was not friendly at all and really hard to communicate with. He changed our groupon from \"two entrees with rice and beans - to any 30 dollars worth of food that we want,\" which was nice, but when I asked him a question he was super confrontational and made me feel stupid.

Secondly, we decided to try the chicken quesadilla and A LOT of tacos. I tried the cod, potato, baja, shrimp, pork, steak, and more. They LOOK extremely appetizing. When I picked them up they were soooo soggy because they were overloaded with different sauces. All of the different textures together made me want to vomit and they did not mix well at all. The pork was soo dry, the carnitas were chewy. The quesadilla was bearable, but very drippy. After I left I immediately went into another quick store to get something else to fill my stomach. 

I wish I spent all of my money on chips and drinks. Then maybe it would have been worth it. The decor is cool and it is a small, cute place, but I think the food is really gross and I would not bother writing this YELP review if I didn't feel so strong.

I am gagging while writing this. Don't bother."}
{"text":"My better half and I decided to try this place on a whim. Actually it was her decision and it might be her last. 

The place actually looks cool. Cozy atmosphere, cool wall graphics, open doors and plenty of TVs. We sat inside (they have a patio but don't have a license of some sort, so people can't actually dine outside)
HOLY HOTBALLS! An educated guess would say it was 85 degrees in there. No Kidding. Even the servers were dipping out to grab some fresh air!

Was eventually greeted for our drink order. I ordered an Ice Tea...... \"Sorry, there is a misprint on the menu, we don't have Iced Tea\" WHAT?! No Iced Tea? 

Appetizer Time: Chicken Nachos (FYI Don't expect Free Chips and Salsa)
If your in the Area you might as well goto City Tap. Their Nachos are 10x better and I don't even think they try.  I guess there was a little bit of Pulled Chicken on them. I couldn't find it but was starving so I scarfed them down. 

Main Course: Barbacoa Taco and Steak Taco. $3 respectively. Jane F. was right, I wish I would have ordered 10 more too! They came out Half Filled. I've literally gotten bigger tacos from Taco Bell. I'm your average 30 yr old and I could have smashed 10 of them. 
 
Places like Barrio put this joint to shame. It's not even close. If this \"Taco Bar\" wants to stick around they better step up their game. 

I would have given them one star but I could see myself returning for a drink. The atmosphere is cool. Just stay away from the food unless MAJOR changes are made."}
{"text":"Camino is a great place if you hungover or craving so good TexMex.  Waitstaff is friendly tequila flows freely and beer selection has the traditional selection of mexican beers."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I stumbled across this place while shopping and visiting from out of town.  
Great atmosphere. Cute bartender.  I loves the interesting taco combinations. Try the mango iced tea!  I didn't feel rushed at all. 
Can't wait to come back and sit outside."}
{"text":"The server was very friendly and the food was timely. That earned the two stars. We were the only table at 7:30 on a Saturday night though. 

The food was disappointing. Not terrible. But with a million choices around the CLE area for Mexican, I won't likely be back.

Good bottled Mexican beer selection.

My watermelon margarita was bland with just a little bit of generic crappy syrup in it (if you told me it was peach, cherry, mango, etc, I wouldn't have known the difference... 

The guac flight (mango, bacon, & regular) was unimpressive. All three tasted pretty much the same and were in no way flavorful.

The shredded beef empanadas were good.

My sister got the quesadilla which tasted like bar food. Not good at all.

My carnita taco was made from a dry, breaded pork chop, and toppings that weren't listed on the menu (not sure I even got the right taco) and the shrimp taco was also dry and DOUSED in sriracha. I love spicy, I live sriracha. I gave up trying to eat it halfway through.

My boyfriend's beer chicken taco was really good. The barbacoa was blah. 

One plus is that their tacos all come on soft corn tortillas which is AWESOME for me personally. Now if only the contents were great.

Also: atmosphere was douchey. Music sucked. Parking is of course not great b/c of its location, but that's not a ding on them, just a tip for you.

Go to El Carnicero, Momocho, Barrio, Luchita's, or Taco Tonto's instead"}
{"text":"This place was the bomb! If I lived in Cleveland I would be here all of the time. 1/2 price tacos on Monday were awesome! Drinks were awesome and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. The guaca and queso is excellent. The steak taco is phenomenal. And I do not think I've had a better quesadilla. Ever. Awesome service and will be coming her frequently"}
{"text":"The service, drinks and atmosphere are all great but the food is really lacking.  

The chips are obviously store bought and the enchilada's are made with really floury tortillas.  Traditionally enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, which I know they have because that is what they make the tiny tacos with.  The enchiladas also come with cheese not graded but there are slices of cheese on top melted. 

I think this place has real potential but they need to look into Mexican food and adjust their menu!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. I first \"tried\" their tacos at the yelp event last month. They had a taco bar and it was delicious! So, I was so excited to actually visit soon after the event. However, once I actually did, I wasn't so impressed.

Pros:
- They have a large drink selection! They have their own signature drinks that range around $9.00-10.00 each - I didn't try these, but my friend enjoyed her Cucupeno (cucumber and jalapeño infused tequila..). Their beer list is large and it's reasonably priced! $3-4 dollars per bottle!  
- Service was fine. Nothing to write home about but also no complaints at all.
- I was pretty impressed with the guac! I hate when I go places and have to add salsa in the guac to give it more flavor because it tastes like it's just mashed up avocado. But, it seems like other reviews indicate the opposite, so that makes me question the consistency of it.

Cons:
- The taco I ate at the yelp event was delish and flavorful. The tacos I tried at Camino- not so much! The beer chicken taco: little dried pieces of battered chicken and some garnishes. Not impressed at all. The Grilled Avocado taco: literally what it says in the name. Grilled avocado in a corn tortilla. Bland. Not impressed yet again.
- You have to pay five dollars for chips and salsa. Not worth it in my opinion (which is why I got the guac)
- The tacos are 3 dollars each and really don't have much on them and are pretty small. I know that's usually the case with street tacos but if they at least tasted good, maybe I would think they were worth it, but when I can go to another taco joint and fill my tortilla with tasty ingredients upon ingredients for 3-4 dollars, I find it hard to be ok with spending 3 dollars each on these. 

I don't know, maybe if I build my own taco, I'll like it a bit better like at the Yelp event. Or maybe they brought their A-game to the event and this is how their tacos really do taste. But, their build your own taco is basically choosing a protein, picking 3 out of 5 topping options (cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro), and picking a salsa. 

Overall, just not too impressed. I think this taco bar should work on the quality of their tacos. Drinks may be a reason I go back, but there are plenty of other places downtown to get drinks, as well."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing, almost as good as the service we received from Bron!! Thank you for a fantastic lunch!"}
