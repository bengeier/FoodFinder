{"text":"My sister and I stumbled across this place while getting her car washed. We went there and was told about the 5 dollar special. We decide to share a meal which consisted of baked chicken, macaroni and cheese, and black eyed peas. The chicken was nice and tender. Black eyed peas where cook to perfection and the mac and cheese was very cheesy. It was overall a good m eal. My only complaint is that since then I've attempted ro go back but they close way to early. So I'm attempting to find another spot thats open in the afternoon hours."}
