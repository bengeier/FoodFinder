{"text":"i don't know why everyone is hating on this place. i just went to it and was very satisfied. they're not trying to give you traditional indian food so don't expect it and then whine when you don't get it. reeellaaxx. they're doing dosa wraps and trying to give you something different, which i'm all for. having said that i tried the most traditional wrap on the menu which was the masala dosa and it was ssccrrummmpttiouuss. i've had my fair share of masala dosa's and this was good. along with the potatoes, there was some lettuce and other stuff inside that really added to the taste. my buddy had the jerk chicken dosa wrap (like I said, they're not trying to be traditional) and it was pretty tasty too. the place is chill with a nice big communal table and some cool mosaics on the walls. they also have indian sodas in the fridge so treat yourself to some thumbs up (indian cola) or limca (lime soda) while your there. i thought it was perfect place for eclectic queen west."}
{"text":"Madras Pantry's Dosa is eh- Okay.  As my friend put it, \" I'll just eat the Chutney.\"  The guys behind the counter don't offer a lot of advice on what to order or what is all in the wraps. I almost feel like they are jumping on the wrap-burrito bandwagon.  Just another food you can eat while walking down the street.  The concept is decent, but the execution still needs some finesse. For starters, a plate would be nice to offer. Dosa's are served on a wooden board.  Most dosa's are served with chutneys on the side- tomato based or coconut based flavor-packed dipping sauces.  The chutneys were quite good, but we had to ask for extra chutney on the side. Some other complaints Too much lettuce inside the potato mixture. The dosa dough isn't what I was expecting. It falls apart a little too much, and although it's not too far in taste- it could use something. Less yeast? More salt? Work on that dough, guys. I'll be back, but I'd like to see some changes to up the flavour.  We tried the Lychee Lime Lassi, which came with compliments from the guy behind the counter- it's not really that tasty.  The mango lassi, both were served in authentic metal cups, was more authentic and tasty.   Finally, there is a pantry part of the store. I haven't spent much time in Indian grocery stores, but it gets me thinking about all the wonderful indian food that could be made at home. I went home with some Cilantro Chutney that I'm dying to try the next time I bring home some papadum."}
{"text":"the worst Dosa and a terrible excuse for Indian food in a city that has many great options..."}
{"text":"Dosa! and Kulfi across from a park..  came back for some kulfi ( icecream like) to walk across the park with on a hot day. traditional flavors, my favorite is pistachio.. no cardamom today..  i havent yet tried their take out, (due to an unexpected run in with alibabas see my review), but this trendy , commute decor inspired indian dosa hut conveniently located beside chippys give an alternative to 7-11 and fish and chips.. a great addition to the south of trinity strip.."}
{"text":"So I tried out the butter chicken Dosa and I enjoyed it but definitely not blown away. The restaurant itself was nicely laid out and looks trendy. I think it's really worth checking and trying, although I feel next time I go there I'll just buy the authentic Indian spices they sell and make something myself :)"}
