{"text":"A little off the beaten path but well worth the adventure. The ambience of the restaurant was great. The staff and most importantly the food was fantastic! A must have is any of their risottos. Had the carbonara with shrimp-the real deal. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this restaurant which truly is a hidden gem. While it's location is a little off the beaten path, the food was absolutely delicious on both occasions that we have been there.  Each of our party of six on today's visit, enjoyed a different entree.....including pasta with bolognese sauce, grilled branzino, salmon, and a chicken in panko crumbs.....and each dish was delicious, perfectly flavoured and presented beautifully.  Service was attentive and gracious. While the location and atmosphere are a little lacking, the food makes up for this. We will return."}
{"text":"Last night, I enjoyed my fourth visit to La Locanda and the experience could not have been nicer. The service was truly wonderful (thank you, Tara) and the food delicious. The soup of the day was just like my mom had made it herself. We enjoyed two delightful wines with our pasta dishes. My three guests and I could not have asked for a nicer evening. Run, don't walk to this fantastic venue."}
{"text":"So there are so many restaurants in Scottsdale...  it can be overwhelming.  This place is a hidden gem!  Get reservations and eat here before people find out how good it is.  The next time I'm in Scottsdale I am coming back.  My husband and I shared the grilled squid appetizer and it was AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm Spaghetti Bolognese was awesome. Will be back for the Bronzino next time. Ask for the bruschetta, maybe they will put it on the menu."}
{"text":"My mom brought me to La Locanda this evening for a birthday dinner and we got a great bottle of Cabernet (Motto), Seared Scallop Risotto, Penne Alla Russa, and they very kindly treated me to a birthday dessert of tiramisu. Our food was perfectly cooked and so delicious! Staff was helpful and attentive with no issues. A gentleman who I think may have been the manager stopped by to check in on us as well. I loved the ambiance and the whole look and feel of the restaurant and will definitely be back! Thanks for a wonderful experience, guys!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: CHEF VOLPI HAS REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE RESTAURANT  La Locanda and Chef Andrea Volpi are as good as it gets in this town. Andrea is an amazing Chef and puts out superb tasting food using the best quality ingredients he can source. His recipes are a great combination of Old School Italian and new dining trends; resulting in tasty dishes at reasonable price points. I have read the other reviews on this site, and all I can say to the few negative reviewers is \"WHAT?\"! If you want a good meal, go here for lunch or dinner. Ask for Chef Andrea. He is a great person and will cook you what you desire. This is the continuation of the La Locanda that was located at Scottsdale rd. and Shea several years ago; so happy to have it and Chef Andrea Volpi back!"}
{"text":"Had the Lobster Risotto and it was hands down some of the best food I've ever had. Went in with a group and everyone shared a little bit of everything and I can honestly say that everything was delicious. Not only was the food amazing, the service was just as good. Had a great experience here and can't wait to go back. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service.  Highly recommend for you and guests! Fresh, authentic Italian food. Beyond good and worth stopping by for a dinner or cocktails with appetizers. So fresh with high end ingredients."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the place was in an odd part of town (we were visiting, so not very familiar with the area), and the restaurant was completely dark from the outside and barely anyone in the restaurant on a Friday night.  Kind of odd.  We brought our own wine and were told we couldn't open it due to their permits, but the attitude of the server was the main set back, and the vibe (or lack there of) of restaurant was off."}
{"text":"I think they just opened or re-opened. I was there on business and some of the foodie locals hadn't heard of it yet. I am glad I took the chance. Nice menu offer, northern Italian (think chops and veal) not much in the way of red sauce but pasta is made in house, fresh daily. Extensive bar menu. Great server, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just saw yesterday on Open Table that LaLocanda was open again.  Yeah!  Ate there last night and was delicious!  Andrea (chef) came out frequently to make sure everyone was happy.  They modified a dish for me because I'm Vegetarian with no problem. My husband had the pork chop and loved it.  Will go back soon.  Different atmosphere but still good and much larger bar, so can eat there too.  They've only been open a little over a month.  Parking was not a problem but they also have valet."}
{"text":"Omg! Great food and amazing service. Super cute interior. Very accommodating kitchen. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This venue has been many restaurants/bars over the years.  La Locanda will be a survivor.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Jesse, our waiter, was fabulous.  The food was the best Italian meal I've ever had.  The Osso Bucco was rich and melt in your mouth.  The pappardelle with pork and veal bolognese was layered with flavor.  Thank you for adding sophistication to this side of 5th Avenue that has been missing for years.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Just finished our first dinner at La Locanda. Great food, great service and ownership. Get a mile off the beaten path of Scottsdale and enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"First time at la locanda.  I had heard it was a new restaurant in old town scottsdale & that it was worth the trip.   Excellent eats & service & atmosphere.  All of the employees & owners with whom i interacted were extremely friendly & concerned about my needs & wants.   Friday in lent so i ordered both gnocchi w/meatless sauce & salmon.  They were delicious & the prices were in line w/what i expected.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Branzino and sweet potato ravioli were fantastic! I would stay clear if the penne al Russo."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing!  We were visiting Scottsdale this past weekend and decided on this restaurant due to its great ratings.  We made reservation for 8pm and were seated immediately.    Location:  The restaurant is located next to the fashion square district, very clean and safe.  Plenty of parking outside and very stylish inside.  The food:  We ordered pappardelle bolognese, clams linguine and their salmon special (all suggested by our server, Susie).  Let me tell you, the pasta dishes were out of this world! They were one of the best pasta dishes we've had and we've had nothing better.  They were so yummy that we almost licked the dish.  Now for the salmon dish....oh my goodness!  I am a seafood snub and I can tell you that the salmon was the freshest I've had.  Every bite was sure pleasure!  To top it all, just before we were getting ready to ask for our bill, Susie gave us a complimentary dessert which was an unexpected surprise to us.  With the first bite on this dessert, my hubby and I looked at each other and right away wanted to know what it was.  It was so creamy but, at the same time, so light and ohhhh so delicioso!  We were told that is was panna cotta.  Now we've ordered all kind of italian dessert in the past but this was the first time we've had it and it will be one that will add to our list.  The server:  Susie was our server and she was the best!  She gave us recommendations and were very happy with everything she suggested.  She was super friendly and very knowledgeable, as well.   We chatted with her briefly about our experience when we traveled to Italy and the food there compared here in the States.  We were very lucky to have been assigned to her table and we left the restaurant with a feeling of great satisfaction and outstanding service.  Next time we are in Scottsdale, we look forward to coming back to this restaurant and we will definitely ask for her.  All in all, great experience and one that we will always remember!  Thank you guys for making it memorable!"}
{"text":"We came to dinner with friends. Had a wonderful meal. I had the Branzino. Which was excellent  My husband had the Black Pasta with fruita di mare. He enjoyed that as well. Our friends both had pasta which they enjoyed. . Would recommend this restaurant to all the foodies in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had dinner at La Locanda last night with friends who have been going for many years.  I loved the location, tucked away on 5th street just north of Indian School.  And the food and service was superb!  The menu is one page which I love - the wine list was good and the special last night - lobster risotto - was divine!  The atmosphere was just right and Chef Andrea stopped by to say hello and check on how they were doing.  I would highly recommend La Locanda!"}
{"text":"I am confused, we bought a Groupon for this restaurant based on the reviews. What I ate had nothing in common with the reviews! I started with a cup of tomato bisque soup that was good, very tasty in fact. My friend had the capri salad which was good. My main course was the papperdelle pasta, I know it's one of the signature dishes. My pasta was so hard, the sauce was ok (not to die for), but the pasta was thick and hard. Serious I cook pasta at home and I never would have served this! My friend is a vegetarian, there were no pasta choices for her. She asked for spaghetti or something like it with a vodka sauce. Her's was not good either. It was shiny with oil or butter and way over salted. We got a desert to split and it was good. I don't know if it was an off night for this restaurant (it was a Monday) or what the problem was but based on what I ate I wouldn't go there again. Both of us barely touched our entree's and left it behind! No to go with that mess!"}
{"text":"Great food and killer drinks. The staff was super friendly. They were empty when we went, but they're a bit off the beaten path."}
{"text":"We just left and I am astounded at how this place got good reviews. We ordered chicken Parmesan and gnocchi. The homemade gnocchi was horrible and the chicken Parmesan was just as bad. I'm not even a picky eater! The chicken was so processed I couldn't eat it. I literally ate the breading with cheese. The gnocchi made my husband gag. I gave two stars instead of one because my blueberry Moscow mule was delicious! But I will never go back here, not worth the calories or the money."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem in old town is delightful! Fantastic service, and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the time and money and find another Italian place. Food was not good, the server was rude, and they charge for ice in your drinks!"}
{"text":"I chose to eat here because it had great reviews but when I walked in, it was completely empty and I was a little concern. However my concern was quickly dissipated. We had excellent, attentive service and the food was magnificent. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Very quiet in the restaurant so I was a bit skeptical.  I was wrong.  Food and service were both excellent.  I had the salmon penne and my wife had the mushroom risotto.  Chef treated us to a delicious caramel desert.  Prices were average to below average for quality of food in location.  Nice decorations and ambiance.  Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a very good neighborhood gem. I/We will eat here often.  No lunch though, just dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Caprese salad was decent but was seriously short on the balsamic reduction which was a bummer. Risotto was done well but lacked something. Waiter was sort of snarky. Nice looking main room but if you get seated in the other room all sounds echo and you can hear all the conversations around you. Stay in the main room if possible. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"My daughter and I celebrated her birthday in December,  and it was our first time here.  The service was excellent as was the wine selection as well as the wonderful menu items! It was just  perfect! The Sea Scallops and Risotto were a dream and went well with the wine selection.  They even brought out a birthday treat and she loved it!  We highly recommend restaurant to all.  The pricing is perfect,  service was stellar! We will be returning a lot!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this restaurant and when my boyfriend and I pulled up we were happy to see an abundance of parking on a Saturday night in Scottsdale. We were also a little worried because there was only one other party besides us...did that mean the food wasn't that great? NO!! We got the Lobster Bisque and wanted to drink it down because it was so complex and flavorful. My boyfriend got the Lobster Risotto which was packed with lobster and so delicious. I got the sea scallops over risotto and the scallops were large and the risotto cooked to perfection. We ended with the strawberry cheesecake made in-house from a recipe from one of the line cooks. Gorgeous and so tasty! The service was wonderful and we can't stop talking about how good the food was. This place is a little hidden gem so better check it out while you can!"}
{"text":"I would have never known about this place if it weren't for yelp. What a hidden gem. Great, authentic Italian.  I had the pappardelle bolonges. It was amazing.  Great service and atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service, everyone is super friendly.  Food is incredible.  This would be a great date night spot."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for a Valentine's Day dinner. The food was delicious and the service was great. I'd dine here again. I only regret that we didn't take advantage of the 10% yelp discount the have going on. I noticed it and then forgot to mention it."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!!! A must is the Grilled Calamari antipasti!!! And also the Seared Day Boat Sea Scallops. The staff is also extremely nice. They made my mothers birthday special."}
{"text":"Mille Grazie! Just tried La Locanda Ristorante Italiano.  The dishes were very carefully prepared and presented.  The grilled calamari is a spectacular appetizer, with a unique Limoncello Broth, Borlotti beans, and just the right amount of charring -- yum!    The Frutti di Mare was presented artfully, and contained a bountiful portion of delicious sea treasures, including Mussels, Scallops, Salmon, Shrimp, and baby Lobster tail - Magnificent!  It was equally comforting to find the owner on premises, ensuring that guests were well taken care of (all too rare in today's corporate restaurant landscape).   Finally, and most notable, was our \"waitress\", who definitely was not \"waiting\" for us to put our order in.  She demonstrated genuine interest in our tastes and ingredient preferences, and served as more of a \"personal food & beverage tour guide\" - Thank you, Heidi, for taking such great care of us, and making the evening special!"}
{"text":"I was really wanting to like this place a lot!The location is tucked away on the out skirts of Old Town, it's kinda nice when you don't want to deal with the loud crowds and limited parking in more central parts of OT. The menu sounded amazing and their wine selection was intriguing. I invited two of my girlfriends to check it out with me. I got there a little early expecting it to be busy, but there were only a handful of tables occupied. I decided to go with the pan seared salmon, but switched out the sides for the crispy potatoes and creamy spinach. The portion sizes were on the smaller side, so don't come here expecting a hefty/filling meal. My meal was ok, not anything to really brag about, I don't recall any seasoning or real flavor on the salmon. My friends split the penne alla Russo, they enjoyed it. Overall it was a fair experience, leaning towards underwhelming. And unfortunately, this morning both of my friends reported that they got food poisoning... so that definitely dampers the over all experience. Not sure if we'll make it back after that..."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant In Scottsdale and the food was delicious. I had pasta Bolognese, my husband had linguine with clams in red sauce and his brother had the same dish with a white sauce.  The pasta is made in house and was so good. The chef modifies dishes if you like a certain dish. The food and service were excellent!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love trying out small neighborhood eateries and this was good. Not great, but solid, and service -- while a bit slow -- was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely the stand-out dish was the lobster risotto! Really rich, but perfectly-cooked, with great lobster flavor and good size chunks of meat. The other dishes we had were just so-so...calamari appetizer was overcooked (though the broth was good)...beet salad was mey."}
{"text":"I had the Osso bucco and it was aaaammmmmmazing, our waiter was awesome and definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the Penne Alla Russa with the salmon and I finished the whole plate. That's how delicious it was. I also had the tiramisu, which was hands down the best tiramisu I've ever had. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely worth coming and will be back."}
{"text":"I feel like I hit a gem with this place! Arrived at 8:45 on a Friday night and got sat down right away, parking was no issue either! It was our first time here and our waitress Heidi was extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. We ordered the Black Linguine Frutta Del Mar dinner plate. Hot damn it was delicious! Had mussels, shrimp, scallops and some lobster tail in it with some bomb red sauce! Arugula salad didn't disappoint! We ordered dessert as well, but didn't share! My wife ordered tiramisu and I had the cheesecake! We both cleaned up our dessert plates like no ones business! I only gave four stars because all I had was theses few items off the menu. I would definitely come back and try other options and even some of the specials they offer! Enjoyed everything about this place!"}
{"text":"I read the write up in New Times raving about this place so expectations were pretty high. We weren't disappointed.   Service was friendly and informed but they gave us space during the meal. I never felt like they were hovering.   We started with the grilled calamari and mozzarella. Loved that the calamari wasn't breaded and fried. The sauce was savory with just a hint of spicy heat. The tomato jam made the mozzarella. Great start.   The veal gorgonzola was fantastic as well. Dessert was a challenge because we were so full but the mousse was worth the extra calories.   Great ambiance and wonderful food. Perfect date night. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch the food was great the place is really nice and so was the service. Looking forward to coming back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic Italian food! Delicious and the risotto carabonara and pasta bolognese are delicious. Definitely a must dine!"}
{"text":"Nice wine selection - a mix of Italian and American. Pasta and app were both super fresh and delicious. Service was kind, accommodating and attentive. Highly recommend when you want fresh and upscale Italian!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a Tuesday afternoon was incredibly delicious with seamless service! Thanks Anthony our server.   Prompt service with immediate ice water. Table and silverware clean  -trust it's not always the case :). Ugh. Crisp fresh linen napkin.  Food part We shared a simple yet refreshing light salad with grilled shrimp and calamari. Perfect! They even split the plate without asking and such nice presentation.  warm grilled bread was brought out. Again we didn't need to ask. I could smell the freshness. It came with a creamy butter something. Wow! I forgot to ask -it added a little extra to all ready something great.  I ordered the special of the day. An incredible! creamy! Risotto. Of course I shall be dreaming of that in days months to come  I like food ha. And I LOVE when it is done SO well. The portion was excellent. See pics. Flavors balanced and temp perfect. It a must order!  My friend ordered their bolognese with ziti pasta. It came with fresh cheese on top, ample size portion, tons of delicious meat sauce. he said he loved it several times through his meal with a few omg  yay!  Bottle of wine. Excellent price and more economical than 3 glasses. It was a catch up after many months so our lunch lasted a while. Pinot noir smooth & fruity.  I'm delighted with this menu location and food! Can't wait to return for brunch!!! And dinner with my family.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We came for dinner though it intersected happy hour.  That saved us $6. I had the black linguine with seafood which was very good. Wife had carbonara which was very good. We shared a salad and shared the pannacotta dessert.  Our cocktails were good and slightly discounted. Waiter suggested a good wine by the glass.  sambuca was fine. Aaron did a great job serving us. We will return in the fall. We can't understand the review in the Arizona Republic. Did the reviewer order badly or did the restaurant have a bad evening?"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for dinner at the bar. Staff were attentive, and meal was cooked to perfection. Very relaxed atmosphere, whether with a large party, a date night or solo business traveller. Will stop by again whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food was fabulous:  ossobuco was amazing and pappardelle bolognese was to die for.  Booth seats aren't super comfortable, but the wait staff was fun, well informed and made us feel special.  Roll with the hipster decor and you'll vow you'll come back."}
{"text":"Osso Bucco was amazing. Veal Gorgonzola, superb, just wanted more. Neat wine list. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding, authentic, heart-warming Italian in the heart of Scottsdale. Don't miss the Bufala, Bolognese, Risotto or Tiramisu. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We decided to come try out this restaurant for Father's Day on Saturday evening versus Sunday, so glad we did because it wasn't crowded. Since we had our little one we chose to sit at the wrap around booth versus a table because it's a bit easier for us to keep our toddler contained! We were quickly greeted shortly after being sat & asked if we'd prefer tap or bottled water to start. We were then greeted by our server Matt who ran the specials by us & even had a few suggestions, he was very informative which is always refreshing. We chose to start with a couple of cocktails, for me I went with the blueberry mule & my hubby the mojito... both very good especially the mojito. I started off with a cup of the lobster bisque which was very good with the silky smooth texture & a kick of spice at the end but not too much. My hubby went with the house salad minus the onion, the salad was great & actually plenty to share if we chose. To go with our entrees we had a couple of glasses of Pinot Grigio which I went with the house made black linguine with the mix of seafood which had a light red sauce on it. It was a large enough serving which allowed me to bring home half for a doggie bag. The pasta was perfectly made with just enough sauce & a good variety of seafood with the clams, mussels, scallops & shrimp. My hubby went with the flank steak with the carrots & mashed potatoes which had a dollop of butter hidden inside the potatoes, hubby loved it. For desert we went with the homemade tiramisu....to die for, beyond moist & fresh without being overpowered by being overly too sweet. We of course had to have some slow dripped espresso to go with, perfectly made! Then towards the end as we were slowly finishing our desert because it was so delish one of the owners came to our table to introduce himself. He was gracious enough to offer us some homemade limoncello to finish off our dining experience which we excepted & thankfully so because it was delicious with just the right amount of sweetness but yet it still had that nice kick of the vodka!! Loved everything & we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here with friends on a Friday night and I have no idea why there wasn't a long line out the door. Not only was it not crowded, it was almost empty. How does a restaurant serving food this good not have more customers? Step it up people!   First, we all ordered the mushroom bisque and it was delicious. The bisque was thick and creamy, with precisely the texture one would expect when eating something as nutty and savory as a mushroom. I also had the Maple Manhattan cocktail which was fantastic. They serve it with maple cotton candy and then pour the Manhattan over the top. I had low expectations for the cocktails here and was surprised to have something so creative and tasty at an Italian restaurant.   We ordered the Mozzarella Di Bufala, Roasted Brussel Sprout, Chilli Marmalade for the table. The mozzarella was imported, and I was immediately struck by how much it tasted like the Mozzarella we had sampled in Tuscany. The chilli marmalade blended perfectly with the slightly sweetened roasted brussel sprouts and the salty mozzarella.   I ordered the Penne Alla Russa, Smoked Salmon, Asparagus in a Vodka Sauce and Caviar. The dish was superb, and it was about as authentic an Italian dish as I've ever had at a restaurant in the United States. The sauce was thick and creamy, and the flavor blended beautifully with the caviar. The asparagus was just a bit crispy, creating a contrast in texture to penne, caviar, and salmon. The only thing I would change about this dish would be to have more salmon.  My wife had the Risotto Porcini, Saffron risotto, with creamy porcini sauce finished with truffle oil. She is a risotto fiend, and she really enjoyed this dish. It has all of her favorite things: risotto, mushrooms, and truffle (oil). I had some of the risotto and was immediately reminded of a similar dish we shared at a fancy restaurant on the coast of South Africa. Well done chef!   We finished the evening with a chocolate fudge cake and the Traditional Tiramisu. The fudge cake was exceptional and right in line with everything else on order that evening. Our friends ordered the Tiramisu, but they said that they really enjoyed it.   We will absolutely be back here again! We have struggled to find a good Italian restaurant that we would like to frequent in the area, and La Locanda fits the bill perfectly."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best experiences I've had in a restaurant. Great portion sizes.... And I rarely eat my left overs....... Better the next Day. I got the potato pasta with a Medium Rare steak....... so yummy! I loved that the restaurant was slow when I went in. Felt VIP like and enjoyed the experience. Will go again!!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing....   the staff is awesome.. the food is top notch..  i am not gonna write a huge review with needless banter..  just go you wont be sorry you did!!!!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 came in on Sat noon before July 4th.   Not much traffic.    Great pasta and seafood dishes.   Easily top 5 in Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Pappardelle bolognese is the best I had in Arizona.  Grilled calamari has a great charred flavor.  Excellent mathc w/ a glass of Sangiovese.  Will visit again to try more dishes"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday and had a decent experience. I had moscato wine, chicken parm, caesar salad and the food was pretty good but not amazing. I don't recommend the chicken parm but my brother had the pork chops and it was very good.  I'm more disappointed with the service. Our server was giving us weird looks and not very clear or helpful when we were ordering. It took a while to get bread and I was just expecting better service."}
{"text":"Started off with the grilled calamari and a beet salad with blood orange. They were good. Calamari was cooked tender. Beet salad was nice with the blood orange. The main course was disappointing.   I had the Ossobuco over saffron risotto with kale. The meat was tender but had no seasoning. Very bland and I'm not a salt person. The risotto was more like cooked rice. It was not creamy at all and was also bland. The kale was good. Wife had the gnocchi. It was ok. We have had better. We had to keep asking for bread. They would bring it to 2 little sliced at a time. Never had that happen at an Italian restaurant.   Finished it off with the chocolate mousse. That was $10 for a small rocks glass. It was ok and not worth $20 for 2 servings. In my opinion it needs work for that cost. They had no dessert menu the waiter just told you what they had. The meal was $150 plus tip. No liquor. We had iced tea and diet coke."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch a week ago and had a really tasty lunch, but I couldn't believe how few people were there.  I enjoyed the kale and quinoa salad with salmon...so tasty with carrots, beets, radish and dried apricots with a lemon vinaigrette dressing - a unique combination!  Nice atmosphere, attentive service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to celebrate an anniversary!  They are so attentive! Wonderful food, atmosphere and service! Could not have asked for a better evening!"}
{"text":"Just know that I was on the fence for a 3 or 4 Star review. I was meeting my family/friends for a nice birthday dinner. I made a reservation, read, researched, and bought a groupon for secondary insurance ;-)  This building has been so many random places including the Sugar Shack so I was very impressed with the remodel. It is a beautiful, Modern, but cozy place...well done! My party arrived early, 5:30 for a 6:15 reservation and the initial reaction to the service at the bar from them was \"she really couldn't be bothered\". This is coming from a couple who worked in the food service industry and a well loved retired bartender of 30 plus years in an upscale restaurant.  That put me a little back on my heels to start. The hostess was pleasant to me and they gave us a great booth in the corner where you can see the whole restaurant. Highly recommend 5 star seating. Now, I almost feel sorry for the girl because one could tell she was so new at the job in general, but her awkwardness and lack of general menu knowledge was painful for us all. I understand we all have to start somewhere, but expectations for service in general is pretty high for Scottsdale. 2.5 or 3 stars because she tried. We all had drinks including the blueberry Basil mule(refreshing), IPA, and some Titos...loved the glassware tubs for drinks!  For dinner, we started with Arugula Salad and Mixed greens, very fresh and yummy but a tad small. My gluten free girl asked about gluten free bread. I realize that this may be high maintenance but it is a fact of life that people are eating this way...for purposes I may not always agree with or embrace myself. That being said, her comment to me was based on her lifestyle. \"To be a relevant restaurant these days, you almost have to offer gluten free options, like bread\" I had the Grilled Branzino and it was perfect! I had a salad so the portion was awesome for me with the roasted cauliflower only.  But, maybe throw a tablespoon or two of rice on the plate for giggles so the 200lb guy on my right feels like he got his $$ worth.  The others got scallops, meh, with risotto...not a fan in general but tasted like mac n cheese while much richer and a bit over salted. And Saffron Risotto, which I declined to taste, but they said it was good but a little bland, go figure. And the Pork chop, which again I didn't taste but that got a thumbs up. For dessert, and we ordered the Tiramisu. I am not a dessert person but ugh...I almost cringe to write this. The overall opinion was \"worst Tiramisu ever\".  Now, I know all this is for the most part is not a good review but I believe in second chances and I will go back for another shot because personally,  my food was great. I am thinking brunch or happy hour when I drink more than I eat. I think they did a beautiful job making this space inviting so maybe a few tweaks to the staff training and closer watch on the menu prep... this place could be great! ."}
{"text":"Welcome back to Scottsdale, La Locanda. We missed you!  We had dinner there last night and it was delicious. Loved the gnocchi.  Perfect texture and flavor.  The grilled trout had just the right amount of seasoning and grilling.  The veggies were yummy.  The service was attentive, but not intrusive.  We look forward to going back soon!  Can't wait to have the Lobster Risotto!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and fabulous service. Looking forward to returning very soon for their Black Linguine Frutti di Mare."}
{"text":"Looks like a dive from the street, but through the doors is a cute, fancy little restaurant that has the best Italian food around.  Great for date night or a family celebration. I am Italian (neopolitan - since we Italians all like our own region's cooking) and I don't like many Italian places, but this one rocks!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We had not been to La Locanda at its new location and we did make a visit for Saturday night dinner recently and was impressed with ravioli and especially The pasta with homemade noodles and veal sauce.All of the waiters were very attentive and the atmosphere was great. It is in a part of old town that we rarely go to and it truly is out-of-the-way and if we hadn't eaten at La Locanda before I'm not sure we would've stopped because it is not appealing from the outside but once you get inside and experience some of the dishes you wish you knew about this sooner. It doesn't have the same atmosphere of an Evo but at least were able to hear ourselves in conversation which nowadays it's hard to fine and good restaurant."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to La Laconda!! Our meal was absolutely fabulous!!  The pasta was to perfection and the staff were all friendly and attentive!!  Our dessert was the tiramisu and by far the best I have ever had!  We are definitely heading back next week with family!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was sorely missed when it shut its doors near Shea Blvd/ 6 years ago, and has now triumphantly reopened in far more spacious accommodations. The food and service places this as one of the top, if not the top, Italian restaurants in the Valley. The Lobster Risotto is a culinary masterpiece: subtly flavored and perfectly prepared lobster. A winner!"}
{"text":"The name is very appropriate as the menu and ambiance recreates the sophisticated yet bucolic experience of eating a meal in an Italian Inn outside of a place like Modena.  Don't have much experience with the menu yet but the pappardelle bolognese is among the best in the Valley.  That nook of Oldtown is already loaded with some Italian heavyweights so time will tell if it has adequate staying power."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale for for five days and came across this wonderful restaurant. Every course we had was excellent. Highly recommend!  Food was fabulous. The grilled calamari was tender and the char was perfect.  The Beet salad was delicious with beautiful presentation.  The arugula salad was excellent. The lobster risotto was out of this world and the the black linguine was overflowing with seafood."}
{"text":"I recently dined at this restaurant. This is my new favorite. I had the lasagna and it was the BEST I have ever had. My daughter had the duck also delicious. Service was outstanding"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday for the first time, want to try this for awhile. it was EMPTY we were only people in the restaurant from beginning to end which was good because it was very quiet but also unsure about it because could mean wasn't very good...the location is on a street that isn't very busy so not sure how long they'll survive...hopefully they will though. our server was great, even allowed us to sample the wine before ordering. The Oregon Pinot was very good. We shared the chef's special tri cheese ravioli (for being special was hoping for something more exciting than just cheese) and we had the black linguini with seafood. The mussels were a little too large but scallops on it were good. Were too full for dessert but would have liked to try. Probably will come back on a weekend next time."}
{"text":"AS OF AUGUST 2009, I'M PRETTY SURE THIS PLACE CLOSED DOWN  Ok, this place does look a little ghetto from the outside, if fact they have began to put cardboard signs that read \"Open\" all over the exterior just so people know they have not closed down!  This is place is worth going into though!  My boyfriend brought me here on our first date (Valentine's Day) and we were blown away by the food.  I ordered pasta with vodka sauce and it was outstanding.  My boyfriend ordered the ravioli and it is his favorite thing to order since.  We also ordered calamari which is pretty good and they made a specialty dessert for Valentines day of heart shaped ice cream with chocolate over it.  They also serve make-your-own Bruschetta, really good that is compliments of the house.  What's so sad is that Macaroni Grill is right across the street and always busy, if people only knew that authentic AMAZING Italian food at La Locanda is a better place to go instead of some chain, I don't think they would need to put those signs up anymore!    The waitstaff is on-point and very professional. The Host is my favorite though, he is so funny and very laid back, it's very easy to feel like a regular there.  The host even makes fun of the decor on the outside!  The inside is pretty cozy, nice atmosphere, they could just do a lot more with the place but maybe that's part of the charm.  They have an extensive bar where you can have a drink before you are seated (rare though, it's usually not that crowded).    I want to tell everyone about this place, I love it!  If you or anyone you know is even thinking about going to that Macaroni Grill across the street, steer them to La Locanda, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food!  We loved the chili marmalade on the salmon!  Everything was done to perfection.  You can tell there's attention to detail in every bite."}
{"text":"Had great expectations. Some were met others were dashed.  Just returned from my first visit to this restaurant. I hosted a dear friend of mine from out of town.  Let's start with the good news.  The staff is exceptionally polite and courteous. They make you feel welcome.  This is quite a large restaurant and even though there were quite a few customers it seemed rather empty for a Friday night.  Now the not so good news. The food was mediocre at best.  The mozzarella starter with jam and crisp toast was not bad at all.  However, the entree (seared scallops on a bed of what looked and tasted like risotto) gets a D+. Here's why: only 3 rather small scallops and while they were not too bad the \"risotto\" was unappetizing and both my guest and I left most of it on the plate and declined offers for a doggy bag.  Our server was good but a little bit too anxious to clear off the table.  Not quite sure whether I will return or not."}
{"text":"Yes wow, really impressed. Came on a Sunday, they were serving brunch, but made allowances for us to order off the dinner menu. Heard about the lobster risotto, does not disappoint. Very flavorful with big chunks of lobster. Tiramisu best dessert to go for. Great service, great food, great place to go anytime. We will be back. Thank you to the restaurant for accommodating us.  Go White Sox!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing and this resturaunt and their staff never fail to delight.  I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I found this restaurant a few months back on yelp and had been meaning to try it for awhile. Last night we bit the bullet and tried our luck.  The restaurant is located just before the mayhem of old town Scottsdale, and there was ample street parking, a nice touch. We somehow missed the beginning of the dinner rush and were the second table seated with no wait. Our server was prompt and very knowledgeable about the dishes and nightly specials. In fact all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.   For dinner we ordered the French onion soup as a starter, the veal/pork bolognese and the stuffed pork chop with a  spinach/mushroom/potato salad. The soup was a bit over cheesy in my opinion but the broth had amazing flavor. My bolognese was heaven. My husband loved his meal as well but I felt the potatoes were slightly under seasoned. I wasn't a huge fan of our dessert choice. We ordered the rumchata chocolate mousse, and while it tasted great it had a bizarre texture that I couldn't get past.  In all, we had a great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lobster bisque soup! Most amazing sauce on the mussels!  Ravioli Quattro formaggio was delicious and the linguine-black squid frutta d I mare was superb (I took all the scallops!) yummy!!    Staff was so friendly and inviting!   Very relaxed atmosphere.  We will definitely return!   Look at the desert first time guest receive."}
{"text":"Awesome and I will definitely be back.  Looking forward to trying out the dinner and the brunch menus"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Scottsdale! We went to Italy for our honeymoon and the food reminded us of our time there. Such a lovely ambiance and PHENOMENAL FOOD. Ask for Jorge, he's the man."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Yes this place is amazing!  We wanted a new place to try and came across La Locanda (never went to it when it was on Shea RD)   The interior is very chic and comfortable. The staff was kind, attentive and professional. My husband and I like to order plates to share so we can try several items.  First up was Locanda wrap that was delicious then we shared the Bolognese with pasta which was the bomb!  I have been thinking about it ever since we finished the dish:)  We ended the evening with Pannacotta that was very tasty with the house made caramel sauce. Count us in as regulars."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this gem after a full day of sightseeing. We were famished but wanted a Scottsdale experience. We were not disappointed. We shared among the three of us the papardelle bolognese and penne alla Russa. Both were superb!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best Italian food I've had in Arizona. I've always been disappointed in Italian food here, so I always try to get it when I'm out of town. Fear no longer, I've found it.  My brother had the Bolognese - fantastic. My wife had the caprese salad - fantastic. I had he lobster risotto - equally as fantastic. It's not an easy place to see, so I'm hoping all the great Yelp reviews help!  On top of phenomenal food, our server Tara, was funny and one of the best servers we've had anywhere...ever. The chef came out and greeted us and the owner (or manager) checked on us a couple times as well. Really great food and great people."}
{"text":"Food was incredible. We had what our server recommend, the filet mignon - it was cooked to perfection. The risotto carbonara with shrimp was great too!"}
{"text":"We tried La Locabda on a week night. It's in old town Scottsdale, but hidden on an unpopulated street that mostly has office buildings and some small speciality shops. It backs up to the cannel but you can't see it from inside the restaurant (I kind of thought it would be cool if you could, I love watching people, bikers, dogs go by). The inside is nice, it has white table clothes and feels upscale. We had some drinks (wine for me, beer for him). For dinner, I got their burger, which was just okay. I don't know why I ordered a burger, it didn't make sense as it not one of their specialities as an Italian restaurant. He got a pasta that was on special for the night. I was worried it would be on the sweeter side but it was perfectly balanced! I was jealous that I didn't order it! Our server was very attentive and even brought us out a yummy dessert since it was out first time in! I thought that was a nice touch. I will say the place was empty the entire time we were there, I think only one other table came in (maybe due to the quiet location). I hope they make it as this place has so much potential!"}
{"text":"La Locanda is a genuine Italian restaurant. Not an American version of Italian cuisine. Risotto is one of the Northern Italian specialties. Lobster risotto is often a Saturday night menu special. It is not to be missed. Every item on the menu is meticulously prepared and the service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!!  3-way tie between the food, service and staff.  Wanted to give 10 stars.  New to AZ, we depend heavily on Yelp and Groupon to get experience with new restaurants.  Bought the deal and booked Saturday date night.  We were so warmly welcomed!  We cringed a bit when we said \"oh, we have a groupon\" and braced for reaction.  Jorge, our awesome waiter, was instantly like \"NO PROBLEM - GREAT!\"  PHEW!  Instantly in love with this place.  Started with cocktails and struck up conversation with the table next to us -- also first timers that plan to return.  Followed was caprese salad, vino, bread and yumtastic butter.  Main courses were Bronzino with veg and veal shank --- serious food porn.  Fully admit to making noises while ingesting the gorgeous meal.  Jorge kept good track of us and we shared several laughs throughout the evening.  The owner even came by and thanked us (WOW) for eating at La Locanda.  We were thrilled and felt so welcomed compared to a few other newcomer experiences of late.  These folks appreciate your business and want to offer an excellent night out for a fair price.  Home run.  TELL EVERYONE -- this place is terrific."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time at La Locanda.  We were able to grab one of their last reservations for Valentine's day.  Location is great.  They are in Old Town where Sugar Shack used to be.  I arrived a few minutes early, but was still seated.  The booth they gave us was very uncomfortable, so I requested a table.  The server had no issues moving us, and the table was substantially better.  Drink service was quick.  I ordered a Vodka and soda.  It was in my hand in 3 minutes.  My wife started with Lobster Bisque, I had the Power Salad.  Both were fantastic.  We would absolutely order again.  For our mains, my wife ordered the pumpkin ravioli and I ordered the Black Linguine Frutti di Mar.  The ravioli was a bit sugary for my liking, but the fried sage was a great touch.  My linguine was good, but there was no shrimp and no lobster.  I double checked the menu, it was supposed to be included.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu.  It was good, and I'd recommend sharing.  All of the portions are large.  Overall, the service was great. There were just mistakes made in the kitchen.  I'm sure we will give them another try."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried La Locanda earlier this week. Nice setting, white tablecloth's and low music. Service was very attentive and the drinks were exceptional. The food got off to a rocky start with overcooked mussels, that were in an absolutely wonderful spicy tomato broth with toast points.  Our waitress was quick to replace them with a delightful Caesar salad.  Great taste to the dressing and just the right amount of it.  We went with her recommendation of the Pappardelle with meat sauce, and it blew us away.  Housemaid noodles and a fabulous sauce with plenty of meat.  They were also kind enough to split the order with no charge and no attitude.  I trust they will get the mussels figured out, and we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"When we moved here in 9/97, one of the first restaurants that we fell in love with was Chef Andrea Volpi's place at Scottsdale and Shea. We have seen him over the years and are thrilled that a re-birth of La Locanda has recently taken place. Some of the same dishes have made it to the new place and they are just as stellar as they were years ago. The grilled calamari (white wine, lemon, herbs & sweet peppers) and puttanesca were superb. Just the right chew, saltiness, and the flavors married so well together.  Risotto has always been strong with this Chef and the risotto carbonara this night was wonderful, I have always believed that the tiramisu here is the best, and it again (no changes from the original recipe) was incredibly wonderful. The panna cotta was silk. Peg and I are so excited to once again enjoy the creations of the amazing talented and caring Chef!  Bentornato, è il nostro piacere!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend, great food, very nice service. Try their chef special, and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Wow, everything was AMAZING! We had a caesar salad with the best dressing I've had in a long time. The Special was a bufala caprese salad which we had as an app, delicious!!!! Entree's: Live lobster risotto and Double Breast Chicken Parmesan, was the best chicken parm I've ever had!!! The after dinner specialty cocktails and cheesecake were also very good. Bourbon selection is very extensive. A hidden gem. The best part, this is not a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I think this might be the best kept secret Italian restaurant in Scottsdale.  The dining room was quiet and covered with dark wood.  The food was very good real Italian style food. No crazy fusion food here.  My sister had the lobster risotto and I had seafood in a tomato base.  The lobster risotto was perfectly cooked with a creamy texture that made you not want to stop eating.   If you are looking for tasty traditional Italian food in a quiet and non rushed setting, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Found this place on Opentable. Can't believer we were able to get in. It should be packed on a Saturday night! The decor is very groovy and hip. The service was impeccable. And the food is divine. Homemade pasta. Scallops perfectly prepared. And generous wine pours."}
{"text":"The food is truly amazing, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. It's perfect for date night, or as a starting point before you explore the shops in Old Town.  It would be unfair of me to not mention how amazing the staff is; everyone is friendly and helpful. And the kitchen staff are on point; I can not stress enough how good they are at what they do, and how amazing the food is!"}
{"text":"Although I didn't know until researching afterwards, La Locanda is actually a resurrection/reboot of an Italian restaurant that operated for many years over at Scottsdale Road and Shea. Looking back even further, the restaurant was originally based in Chicago before coming to Phoenix. In June of 2017, the original chef left the establishment due to some conflicts with the creative direction.  La Locanda can be found tucked away in that mysteriously quiet area of 5th Avenue, despite being located very close to the lively Scottsdale Fashion Square. The restaurant itself is a combination of traditional and modernized Italian food that seems to be trying to cover a lot of territory. However, based on the pictures alone, I knew we had to give this place a try.  My girlfriend and I started with their goat cheese salad, although the goat cheese itself is incredibly sparse. It included some good, but strongly acidic strawberries, almonds, and a light amount of citrus vinaigrette. In short, it wasn't too bad. The complimentary bread was your standard stuff, which is served with butter (you don't see that very much these days).  Additionally, we ordered the mozzarella di buffala, which was topped with a rather strange chili marmalade that added some spice. Below the cheese, sat a pile of shredded sprouts. Honestly, for 17 dollars, this thing was simply not good. The cheese, by itself, tasted like nothing - and I do mean absolutely nothing. If it were served to me blindfolded, I would not even be able to tell that it was cheese. It was just very watery and flavorless and we both felt that the additional ingredients were used in order to overcompensate. Trust me, buffala cheese can be incredible, but unfortunately, this just wasn't one of those instances.  For main dishes, my girlfriend ordered the risotto carbonara, which included pancetta, scallions, and egg yolk. In terms of dinner items, it was probably the best thing we tried. Although not the best risotto we've found, the overall flavor was respectably good, although it did clump up pretty quickly.   I opted for the chef's ravioli, which appears to vary based on the day. When the server informed me that it was a four-cheese raviloli, I figured I'd play it safe - since raviloli is usually a pretty failsafe choice. Sadly, the server didn't tell me just exactly what those cheeses were. Gorgonzola was included, which I absolutely loathe - so that might possibly be my fault for not inquiring beforehand. But even if the \"gorg\" was eliminated, the dish would still be subpar. The ravioli were barely stuffed and the texture was way too firm.  For dessert, we chose the tartufo, which is a very soft semifreddo with chocolate ice cream, that's then covered in cocoa powder. It was very light, simple, and probably the best part of the meal. Additionally, my girlfriend ordered a cappuccino, which was okay once sweetened up a bit.  Overall, after dining here, we were both a bit baffled by a lot of the five star reviews. On the positive, the server (and owner) checked up on us and the restaurant itself has a very cool and inviting design. And honestly, I feel that this place has the potential to be great, but with what they're currently serving here, I don't see them as really anything more than a mid-tier priced modern Italian restaurant that isn't quite up to the level of some of the bigger guns located closer to Central Phoenix.  Nevertheless, I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid this place entirely. I still feel it's worth trying. A nearby table of twenty-somethings seemed blown away by everything they were given, so perhaps my girlfriend and I are just too damned spoiled to find the joys in La Locanda.  Oh well. At least we gave them a shot."}
{"text":"BEST NEW PLACE IN TOWN! Great food, hip Italian date night atmosphere. So amazing. Best scallop I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch with $15 unlimited mimosas! Great service and conversation by Michael and the food was good! Dessert was also delicious! We will be back soon to try lunch and dinner! Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated in a cozy booth in the corner. We ordered the grilled calamari and lobster bisque to start. The calamari was beautifully charred on the outside and the limoncello broth gave it a nice flavor. The lobster bisque was creamy and rich. The only thing I would've preferred to see is chunks of actual lobster in the soup. For our main courses, we had the bolognese and the seared scallop risotto with pancetta. Both were delicious with large portions. The pappardelle noodles in the bolognese were velvety and fresh. The scallops were huge and cooked perfectly. One other thing I would've liked is some bread to mop up the sauce with. Maybe they offered it but I did not see it on the menu. All in all, a tasty quaint little Italian spot with quality food in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING and hands down some of the best food I've had in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. I had the lobster risotto special and it was amazing- reasonable portion size and was really well done. The pumpkin ravioli special someone else at my table had was unreal. We had the vanilla bean panacota for dessert and it was delicious! I also cannot say enough good things about the service here- it was top notch!!! They also take reservations on open table which is really useful. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! The cocktails were creative and fantastic. My boyfriend and friend both had risotto dishes that were to die for. This place is a hidden gem! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My parents took me here for my birthday dinner and the food was okay. We started off with the seafood salad for the table and the calamari was over cooked and tasted too burnt for my liking.  The other dishes order were the Seared day boat sea scallops, risotto, saba which 2 of the 3 scallops were lightly frozen on the inside and a bit too cooked on the outside. Hence that was sent back only to be recooked after we finish the meal. My mother order Pan seared salmon, brussel sprouts, baby carrot, chili marmalade and the the veggies were finely sliced unlike what you expected (full size veggies) with the fish being a bit heavy on the butter and mediocre. The last dish was the best and least expensive; the Pappardelle, pork and veal bolognese sauce. The pasta was fresh and ample serving.  I gave the restaurant a 3 star because the limoncello margarita and tiramisu was excellent yet for the dinner pricing, I suggest dining elsewhere for seafood."}
{"text":"If you don't order or at least try the Branzino you just f***ed yourself because it's the best thing on the menu.  The rest of the food is surprisingly amazing.  Probably the best Italian food in old town Scottsdale.  The food truly is spectacular."}
{"text":"We were seated in a round booth. 5 of us and 4 of them bigger men, we moved seats because everyone was very uncomfortable. They moved us no problem into the back room that was reminiscent of a diner. Waiter was helpful with wines. Waitress in training was practicing frothing through our second course. Was addressed by waiter. Kind of funny really. Got mussels, calamari and buffalo mozzarella, all very good. Black squid ink pasta, gnocchi, and papardelle was great. Main course of osso bucco and  beet salad was delicious. Chef came out and gave us desserts and orange creamcello which was amazing. Overall good service, back room atmosphere a bit empty and not very warm, but food was very good."}
{"text":"Took a date on Saturday. As mentioned by the other reviewer, this restaurant is very unassuming from the outside.   The interior is very nice. There are two large rooms: dining and the bar area. The interior is immaculate with a timeless quality. The carpet is plush and the striking chandeliers speak to this establishment's class and elegance.   The wait staff is attentive and professional.   There are daily specials and a diverse menu featuring steak, several types of veal, and fish. The food is very good, but not exceptional. I ordered a stuffed pork chop which was tasty but not \"out of this world.\"   I would consider La Locando to be expensive. Two diners with drinks and a large salad was just under $100.  All in all, it is a nice (but not great) restaurant with above average food that offer an elegant, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm really happy Andrea is back in his own restaurant, and if it is anything like the old la locada it will surely be a major success. We had dinner there last night, and it looks like he's back in the groove!! We're going to take 5 of our friends there next week. Bouna Fortuna Andrea!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful dinner here last night. The food was amazing and the service impeccable. My son had dinner here one night recently and liked it so much he bought a gift card for us. Their Sunday Brunch menu looks so delicious that we will visit again soon. Definitely recommend this lovely restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our family was visiting Scottsdale and found this gem! The service was outstanding and the food absolutely amazing. All fresh and delicious. We will be back for sure since our son will be attending ASU. Looking forward to visiting this establishment again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had a party of 6 and they had great timing with the courses and good suggestions for meals. It's nice when the server knows all about the choices and they can suggest things. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals and drinks and the dessert! Definitely get the tiramisu yummm will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Outside the restaurant, it is eerily quiet. All other businesses are closed and lights off. Sets a curious mood entering the one establishment open. Inside, it's quite open. Unfortunately at 8pm, it was really not busy and makes you wonder why. One half of the restaurant close to the restrooms had lights turned off. Had it been busy, I'd imagine this place would be lively yet comforting. Service: Our server had a trainee shadow her. Usually, I find this a distraction, but it did not bother me at all. She took immaculate attention to all our needs. It's service like this that patrons deserve dining out and yet it's a hit and miss in this town. I was afraid everything would come out too quickly since they weren't busy, but her timing was perfect. Food: We had the arugula salad and I loved it! I could eat that every day! I had the black linguine and I highly recommend if you love seafood. My boyfriend had the scallop risotto and it was delicious and the portion was rather large. (I couldn't help myself and cleaned off his plate!) Overall, I really wish this place was more busy, but that's my preference when I dine out. Other than that, La Locanda deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came with a large group of friends prior to New Years Eve. Service was prompt and polite however nearly half of our party was sick later that evening (Penne Alla Russa, Lobster Bisque) Really put a damper on what should have been a great evening.  Updating review per the owners comments- you have two other food poisoning related comments on this yelp page for the Penne Alla Russa so this is clearly not a new issue."}
{"text":"We had been here for our anniversary back in February and really enjoyed the place. We were told about a great Monday night special for two when we were there and we decided to try it. We called the night before to verify the special was still going on and then proceeded to drive up to Scottsdale for dinner.  We had a waiter who it was his first Monday working and when we went to order told us that wasn't the deal of a salad and entree for each of us plus dessert plus a bottle of wine. We were wondering what was going on and were led on . The manager finally came out and apologized for the error.  The food was delicious and what a great deal for $50. For the two of us. We will be back again and not just on a Monday."}
{"text":"The nice thing about this place is that their prices are really reasonable for the atmosphere and service they provide which is more like a 5 Star. The lobster risotto was as fantastic as their special fish of the day. Highly recommend for impressing your partner ;)"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner last night- I had the lobster risotto-it was exquisite ! Others  had the veal Gorgonzola and the pappardelle bolognese which were scrumptious ! The calamari, salads and the tiramisu were also great. The service was excellent- can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went there with a big family gathering so maybe not the best setting rather a romantic event or with another couple  Atmosphere 5 Food 4 Parking 5 Service 5 Noise 5 ( higher mark means lower noise and is better) Value 4 Overall good place I would go back"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The chef came out and greeted us. We didn't know it was brunch only on the Sunday and the chef offered to make pasta or salad. Which I wanted a salad.  I had an amazing arugula strawberry salad! The pancakes and the French toast stuffed with mascarpone was amazing. Thank you Chef Andrea, Michael and Christopher the manager for making this an amazing first visit. And NOT the last."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal tonight! Gorge and team accommodated us just before closing with grace and charm! We enjoyed a caprese salad with yummy fresh mozzarella and pesto; octopus with dreamy broth; risotto with lobster (see photo); bolognese; and veal chop. All were well prepared and plated - delicious even for finicky NYC dining folks! As former-East Coasters, the lobster risotto was the standout as we rarely get lobster out west and WHOA prepared to this perfection! If it's offered, you should def order the lobster risotto!  (no lobster emoji yet)"}
{"text":"This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result.   Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining."}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 1/2 stars on Yelp??  Something is not right!! We went there for New Years Eve dinner and the food was not worth the price.  We didn't have one dish we were impressed by!  Waste of money!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything here I didn't like. The pasta is amazing and the lobster risotto is to die for. Every single item is always prepared perfectly and they're always willing to accommodate any picky eaters or dietary restrictions. The staff is super friendly and the owner continues to remember me every time I go in. He always goes above and beyond to acknowledge me and offer suggestions. The restaurant is never busy which is frustrating because it is awesome authentic italian. I recommend it to everyone and have never had anyone say otherwise!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place had the best Risotto ever. Special tonight was Lobster Risotto. A big portion $38. Contains at least a one pound lobster.  Highly recommend  We found it on Yelp looking for seafood. It's more Italian with some seafood. It did not disappoint. I had the Fruita Del Mar w Squid Ink Pasta   Excellent sauce. Light on the tomato and not heavy. Again I think less hungry or skinnier people could share.   We also had the Artichoke appetizer. Perfect"}
{"text":"Amazing new Italian restaurant! The decor is awesome but I go to restaurants for the food not the architecture and the food was outstanding! Great neighborhood find! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The wine selection was superb and the dinner was absolutely delicious! We ordered the pork chop... the sauce was so good I wanted a bottle just to take home! Truly a hidden gem in old town that is just primed to be one of the best restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous service, food ambiance and music. My husband and I had a wonderful brunch yesterday and will definitely be back to experience their dinner menu. We're Old Town Scottsdale locals and are always looking for restaurants that tick all the boxes for us. We also met and was served by Carlos, one of the owners, he was so pleasant and did not rush us in the least. Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Mille Grazie! Just tried La Locanda Ristorante Italiano.  The dishes were very carefully prepared and presented.  The grilled calamari is a spectacular appetizer, with a unique Limoncello Broth, Borlotti beans, and just the right amount of charring -- yum!    The Frutti di Mare was presented artfully, and contained a bountiful portion of delicious sea treasures, including Mussels, Scallops, Salmon, Shrimp, and baby Lobster tail - Magnificent!  It was equally comforting to find the owner on premises, ensuring that guests were well taken care of (all too rare in today's corporate restaurant landscape).   Finally, and most notable, was our \"waitress\", who definitely was not \"waiting\" for us to put our order in.  She demonstrated genuine interest in our tastes and ingredient preferences, and served as more of a \"personal food & beverage tour guide\" - Thank you, Heidi, for taking such great care of us, and making the evening special!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.   Thought this was going to be better than it was.  Atmosphere has not changed much since it was Bourbon Jacks so i t looks more casual/bistro ish rather than fine dining. I had expected that this was going to have a romantic or high end atmosphere but definitely wrong.  No tablecloths, the tables and chairs looked like inexpensive informal sets, llighting pretty bright,  and \"cold\" feeling from big room without rug or somethign to warm it up.   One nice touch is the candle on every table.  Service was definitely \"meh\".  Saw 6+ waitstaff hanging out by bar 80% of the 60 minutes during our dinner. But yet we had to wait a long time for a greeting from waiter (took 10 minutes for that), waited for water (took 5 minutes to get a busboy and had to ask for it).   Waiter was hard to understand and did not explain anything unless we asked.  Came over after a hello and apology for being late and said \"what would you like?\". I tried to ask about the specialties and he said all was good. No more explanations or tyring to sell the food, recipes or wine!  Plus we had  to ask someone for water every time, 3 times - even though there was plenty of staff!  Food decent but nothing special Asked for salad dressing on side and waiter grimaced at me about it, but still served dressing on salad. Food came fast.  Was still eating ceaser salad (not very flavorful) when got entree. I ordered the seabass and husband had the fruti di mare. Both were good but nothing amazing.    Have enjoyed both of these dishes way better at other local truly \"fine dining\" nearby restaurants compared to here.  One great thing was that he gave us free dessert at end. It was DELICIOUS!! never had pancetta before but it was amazing.     Sad about this because we had high hopes based on the prior reviews and magazine writeups.  But definitely Will not be back.  Too many other delicious and great service restaurants nearby in Oldtown."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night. It was pretty empty when we walked in and we were not greeted right away so we had to get someone's attention. It was our first time here so we were lightly put off, but I can truly say our first impression was completely wrong! Our server Heidi was prompt, knowledgeable and excited about the menu. She helped us pick out of a bottle of wine from a couple of options we had, and it was delicious! Bread is by request, so we asked for some, and Heidi asked if we would like oil and vinegar with it as well since it comes with butter. I personally think the butter was too salty for the cold bread and the oil and vinegar did it was more justice. The bread is pretty weak compared to everything else. For our main, we got black linguine with a seafood medley and... WOW! Handmade pasta makes me drool! At the end of the meal, Heidi told us that since it was our first time we could get free limoncello or dessert. Obviously we went for dessert, which was a vanilla bean panna cotta with a caramel sauce. Words do not even describe how much I've dreamt of this since! We also got a dessert they had as a special. I don't remember exactly what it was but it was like a cheesecake on top of a moist and dense cake with caramel sauce on top. WHAT?!?! Great ambiance, amazing service, incredible food. Definitely recommend. We can't wait to come back!!   I told a few of my friends and work associates about my great experience and one of them used to work for the owners and had nothing but good things to say. That says a lot!"}
{"text":"Desert and Alfredo sauce pasta are taste really good!!   Desert is soooo good. Service is great"}
{"text":"The food was extraordinary.  I had the black linguine with meat sauce and mushrooms. My boyfriend had penne with shrimp and salmon. So flavorful and reasonably priced. The service was equally impressive.  I  would highly recommend.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, menu, service by Suzie. Nice calm ambiance. I'm really excited that La Locanda is back in Scottsdale. I will be there every month!"}
{"text":"I stopped by with a group of five and was hoping for fresh authentic Italian food, I was not disappointed. My group started off with the signature cocktails, everyone we tried were great and made with fresh ingredients. We all had different meals, I can tell you there was nothing to take home. So glad we found a new top notch Italian restaurant. We will all be back."}
{"text":"Overall, La Locanda delivered when it came to living up to its other yelp reviews. Here's a quick breakdown with what you need to know: * We came on a Thursday, and were a bit surprised to see how empty it was after seeing the incredible reviews, but that was fine with us, because it led to us getting to pick our table, as well as incredible service. * the menu is very true to northern italian dishes, which was much appreciated. I've traveled Italy extensively and have been frustrated with Italian restaurants in the US having menus claiming to be \"traditional italian cuisine\" from a certain region and then having nothing truly traditional to that area. This is one of the few places that didn't disappoint in respect to the menu selection. * I was a fan of the drink menu, and thoroughly enjoyed the Italian Greyhound. If you think it looks good, then go for it because it didn't disappoint. * the food was great: instead of going the traditional route with a antipasti, primi, secondi, and desert, my wife and I split 2 secondi dishes.   * the risotto carbonara with scallops was definitely our favorite, and the best risotto dish I've had in a long time.  * the second dish we split was the Osso Buco, which is essentially like a veal version of bone-in pot roast (it was very good) served over polenta, which is basically like a unsweetened cornbread mash that has a mashed potato-like consistency.   Overall, if you're looking for a romantic, laid back ambiance with very good, traditional italian food, I'd definitely recommend you give La Locanda a try."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian cuisine with attractive decor and Excellent Team service, unpretentious exterior but don't let that turn you off, inside the operation is First Class, great food, moderately priced"}
{"text":"This was such a cute little restaurant! Perfect, or lunch, dinner, or date night!  We came here about a month ago, which I should've written my review then. So I'll try to remember the best I can. I ordered the risotto. From what I can remember, I felt like it need a bit more meat in it. I want to say the drink I ordered was the Sauvage. It was quite yummy.   Everything was really good and I thought it was a super cute restaurant with good food. I would probably come back to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place due to the good reviews and I was not disappointed. I am from the North East Coast and am very picky about the way I like my seafood. When I saw the reviews about the Black linguine seafood dish I had to try it! It was good!  I was pleasantly surprised with the arugula, almond, goat cheese and strawberry salad. I could tell it was made with fresh ingredients and the dressing added a little spice which made it unique.  For dessert I decided to try the gelato. I am not even sure what flavor it was but I should have asked before ordering. It was a little too heavy for me and I also thought I was getting sorbet because on the dessert menu it said \"gelato & sorbet\". I guess that's my fault for not asking.  The service was good and we were seated immediately. I did notice other tables had bread but we never got any bread. Maybe it's something you have to ask for and they charge? I guess I was confused about that. Either way, we will be coming back to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great.  Nice quiet area of Old Town Scottsdale.  Unfortunately service and food did not meet fine dining experience.  Our waiter was friendly, but was not poised and tried too hard to upsell.  His timing was off and he was forgetful.  I had to ask for our dinner bread and remind him to take our entree orders after appetizer.  Timing was too long between courses, which led us out of time for desserts.  I wanted to order veal, but the waiter convinced me to order boned in veal special that tasted scorched.  I still tipped the waiter 20%, but he needs to up his game at a fine dining."}
{"text":"Overall, we really enjoyed La Locanda. It is in Old Town Scottsdale but a little tucked our of the way with great parking. Aaron was a rockstar waiter -- A+! We started with the calamari in limoncello broth. The flavor was good, but the calamari was chewy. The bread was DELICIOUS. Aaron was really helpful with the wines. Then, we had the (whole) lobster risotto. This is not on the menu and only on weekends. That was epic! So delicious. It was like edible lobster bisque. It was perfectly balanced. We did not have any dessert (although we thought about it).   They are starting a special on Mondays for $50 (including a glass of wine) that looks good (although all of the entrees have pasta; they need to change that).  I say give it a try!  If you have any doubts, start with Monday night!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear of a new Italian restaurant in the neighborhood and could not wait to try it.  The restaurant itself was very charming and looks like a great date spot.  However, when we walked in, there was very few people there and instead of being seated at the multiple open booths, we were seated in the middle of an empty dining room.  Our waitress was very friendly and provided excellent service.  We also enjoyed the wine selection.  The food was average, definitely not worth the price that we paid.  We also noticed that the owner/manager of the restaurant was there and introduced himself to the other 2 tables (of couples) that were there eating and offered them a free dessert because it was their first time there.  He did not even so much as glance our way.  I do not know if it is our age (mid-20's) or the fact that I was there with 2 girlfriends, and not there as a couple, but I was appalled.  Returning home, I felt ill and proceeded to get food poisoning and was sick through the night.  I had ordered the vodka penne with caviar and salmon, so just be aware.  I will not be returning and I advise anyone who is not a middle-aged or elderly couple to steer clear.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!! Where to start!! My boyfriend took me here for our date night, first time for us both!! The second we walked in, there were nothing but warm genuine welcomes!! Had the mussels and mozzarella ball appetizer, both very tasty!! Entrees were the bolognese and sea scallops....yet again incredibly good!! Not only was the food great, the service was fantastic!! From someone in the restaurant industry, it exceeded my expectations!! Thank you! And we will be returning!"}
{"text":"We used to live in Scottsdale and visited La Locanda at their former location frequently---now 15 yrs later we were in town for a few days and stopped by their new place in Old Town and I'm delighted to report that the food is just as superb as ever.  But why wouldn't it be with the masterful Chef Andrea still at the helm we would expect nothing less!!  Lobster Bisque and salads were all great starters, followed by Saffron Risotto, Lobster Risotto, Pork Chop and Squid Ink Pasta with Seafood all prepared perfectly.  Desserts were a wonderful ending to a truly superb dinner.  If you're going to be in Scottsdale you absolutely must put La Locanda at the top of must visit list---with Chef Andrea crafting one delicious dish after another you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back!  We loved it!  Great atmosphere, drinks and food were amazing. Ton of personal touches by the owners. This place will do very well. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Can't say a bad thing about this place. The calamari was one of the best things I've ever had. The service was great too! Great spot for a date or group of friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thanks Groupon for helping me discover this new Italian spot in Old Town a little off the beaten path.   Decor/ambience - 3.5 stars  Service - 3.5 stars  Roasted artichoke appetizer - 5 stars One of be best I've ever had and the oregano aioli sauce was on point! This should be a regular menu item - I would come back just for them alone.   Lobster bisque - 5 stars  So rich and incredibly flavorful. No lobster chunks but flavor makes up for it. Split a bowl between two people ($10) and it's the perfect amount.   Entrees - 3 stars  Scallop dish came with 3 large scallops that were tasty but I prefer a lemon-butter based sauce. Came served with a plate full of risotto that was flavorful but a little too overpowering for me. Black linguine seafood pasta sauce was a little mild and not too flavorful.   No dessert this time - I was totally stuffed!  Best part of the meal was the appetizer/soup. Oh and the $25 for $50 of food Groupon was awesome and made it worth it too!"}
