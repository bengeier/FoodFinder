{"text":"If it wasn't $13 or whatever then perhaps I'd be more accommodating. But charging an extra $1 on top of that for some squares of seaweed? I think that you will find more authentic ramen restaurants laughing at you. The flavor is okay but it's not very fatty. Trying very hard to be a good fatty broth, but not pulling it off. Noodles are okay. Not inspiring chewiness or texture. My wife's noodles were undercooked. Pork belly was reasonable. Egg was done very well. But still, why do you charge so much damn money? Ramen is not supposed to be artisanal. It's supposed to be cheap, fast and tasty. At least Sujeo has good noodles. But don't even get me started on Umami's watery broth garbage."}
{"text":"For those with peanut allergies (and don't expect it to be in Japanese cuisine) beware: They use peanut butter in their vegetarian ramen option, and it is not mentioned anywhere in their description of it.  In fact, nowhere on the menu is it mentioned, nor is there any notice about food allergies in general. Had we not asked our server, I'd have gone straight to the hospital in anaphylaxis.   Of course, I ask every time regardless - but the point is that (1) not everyone will, (2) it's mentioned zero times anywhere in the ingredients description/menu, and (3) peanuts are traditionally not used in Japanese cuisine.  I have no problem with \"fusion\" restaurants being creative, but for Christ's sake, mention the use of common food allergens please! Even something as simple as \"notify your waiter of any food allergies\" would suffice.  That said, the environment and mood of Morris Ramen is great. They did a nice job of capturing that cramped and stuffy \"ramen house vibe\" you often find in Japan. Their staff was also very friendly and welcoming.   It's too bad I won't be able to try their ramen!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Morris ramen and a spiced pear saketini. Rich, full of depth, and savory. The broth was rather salty but considering the flavor it punched, I was quite alright with that. Compared to other ramen places around Madison, this place probably has the best. The saketini wasn't necessarily to my taste but still quite good. Pear flavors were definitely there, my only thought is it doesn't pair quite as well with ramen as it might with meat! A bit pricey, but considering the location it makes sense.  Great service, friendly atmosphere, fantastic food."}
{"text":"Been here three times now, that's how much I love the ramen! It is such a fun little place to visit off the square. I've had ramen at almost every ramen place in Madison, and this place is definitely one of top contenders."}
{"text":"I took the Morris Ramen, named after the place. Pretty good Ramen, definitely not Japanese level but in the top of what you can get in the US."}
{"text":"Awesome is a much abused word these days, but deserved here.  The cocktails are inventive, the pork buns delicious, and the ramen so rich you probably will have leftovers. Service is prompt and friendly, but Dan, Francesca, honestly, can we talk about those 'cube' seats a minute?  Maybe mix in a cushion? Or let me reserve a seat at the bar. Otherwise love the vibe and decore."}
{"text":"I'm a believer. Until now, I have mostly found ramen to be noodles in broth. But this is for real. We both had the Morris Ramen and it was absolutely delicious to the last drop of broth. Cocktails and great local beers on tap. Cozy and quick service. I wish this place was in Minnesota! I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"The ramen we ordered was the Morris ramen. It costs 13 dollars. The broth was a bit salty for my Taste but overall was delicious. Not super crowded and has lots of seating. Definitely will eat here again and would say is the best ramen place in Madison. Main complaint is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The pork belly in the Morris ramen is incredible. And the noodles - ohmygod. Amazing. Just point to anything on the menu - you can't miss.   One note - you can order for pickup, but not the ramen. They say it doesn't keep. Be warned."}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious and comforting. Walking in, one can smell the umami in the air. It is warm and friendly, with excellent prices, and beautiful atmosphere.  I had the Morris Ramen bowl. It was huge, and I was able to get a full second meal out of the take-home container. It had so much deep rich taste and smooth texture, and was hot and satisfying. Perfect for winter time.  I also started with the kimchi which was fresh and flavorful. Our server was sweet and attentive. I love it there and am going back soon!"}
{"text":"Got their classic Morris ramen. Wasn't bad but definitely didn't blow me away. Noodles: generally prefer firmer noodles close to al dente, but I don't think thats something you can adjust at this restaurant. For me, the noodles were too soft and reminded me exactly of instant ramen.   Broth: Was good but not amazing. Not as gelatinous as I was hoping for, and for some reason the broth looked like it was going to \"break\" (not uniform, and more like small bits and chunks). Flavor profile was average.   Pork: delicious and just the right portion. Only thing is that it reminded me of a brisket than original chashu pork (can't say no to brisket though!).  Egg: egg looked good, but as soon as I bit into it--it was STONE cold. After prepping it, they probably refrigerate it and then just place it on top. The egg is one of the best parts in ramen--so it was quite disappointing.   Menma: great taste and consistency. Again only problem is that it was also pretty cold.  By the time I mixed the menma and the cold egg, I could tell that the temp of my ramen went low which really stinks. Ramen is suppose to warm the soul!!  Overall, not a bad place to get ramen. Have yet to be impressed by ramen in Madison, so I'll keep my eye out."}
{"text":"Loved. This. Place. I lived in Japan for 4 years so have a kind of picky ramen palette. I was seated and acknowledged right away (yay) and sat at the bar alone. I was pleasantly surprised by the casual friendly knowledge of the bartender. We talked a lot about beers and sake (when he wasn't bartending, answering the phone, seating people, serving dishes, or drying glasses). I really loved the quiet machinery of the friendly staff. They all seemed to work together to put out an efficient and delicious product. The noodles were perfectly cooked; the broth was awesomely flavored, the pork was tender and delicious, and what was really cool was Morris's touch on the bamboo shoots. Somehow he added a sweetness, which made them tasty!! I hated them in the ramen of Japan!! The liberties taken on traditional ramen are 100% worth it. I'll be back again from Chicago just to eat and drink here again. Soon."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Very small space, so we could not get in on a Friday night.  But daytime lunch was so good.  Ordered the Morris Ramen as pork belly makes MY belly so happy.  The noodles were fresh-as-a-daisy and I could not get enough.  Over-easy egg (not sure what bird--probably organic chicken but tiny enough to be another bird) was delicious.  A bit pricy for lunch ($15)--they did have a Ramen + PBR lunch special that I thought was sweet and SO appropriate for Wisconsin.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome surprise. What started out as yet another ramen joint has quickly grown into one of Madison's downtown staples. It does what it sets out to do: serve good ramen with midwest ingredients.   It's slightly pricier than you'd expect ($11-$15 for a bowl) and slightly busier than you'd expect (people love ramen apparently), but this is some good ramen and I always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss to this ramen and pretty much everything on the menu. Yaaaassss (is this long enough to post as a full \"review\" yet, Yelp?"}
{"text":"I've been to Morris Ramen twice now, and both experiences were mediocre. The first time I went I shared the Morris and Miso with friends, and found both to be mediocre. The ingredients and noodles were good, but the broth was very bland. Neither of my friends enjoyed it very much. The second time I went there with different friends, and I had a similar experience. We ordered pork and chicken buns, and chicken wings to start. The pork bun was good, but not spectacular. The chicken bun was lacking in flavor, but the chicken wings had a good flavor and paired well with the pickled daikon. I was disappointed when we got the ramen, the Spicy and the Miso, as the broth was again very bland. The additions were all great, the pork belly was good, and the noodles were perfect. The broth has a lot of potential but definitely needs work. Both groups of friends that I went with said they likely would not return due to a bad first impression, but I would definitely like to give Morris another chance if improvements are made."}
{"text":"*This is based solely on my experience as a gluten free eater* I have tried the veggie ramen, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It just didn't have much flavor, and I wasn't a hug fan of the vegetable pocket included. Morris has a great atmosphere and a good selection, but as a gluten free eater, it isn't the tastiest."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Small place tucked away, with the cutest interior. All the staff were super friendly. Now let's talk about the food. O...M...G! I came on a Wednesday night and got \"the special\":  Morris Ramen and a Sapporo beer for $15. The broth was excellent and the chashu pork was like butter! I added short rib and it really took it to another level. The beef bun was to die for. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison! Nice ambiance, friendly and well-informed staff (always happy to answer questions and provide recommendations), and incredible food!  I usually start with the Beauty School Dropout (gin, lychee, lime, and grapefruit).... Yum!   I then have an internal battle over whether to order the wings or fries. These are some of the best wings I've ever had and I love the kimchi ranch they come with. The satsuma fries (kind of similar to sweet potato fries) are thick-cut and served with a delicious gochujang aioli. Both come out quickly and are served nice and hot. The buns are also delicious but I usually gravitate toward the other options. Ordering an appetizer isn't necessary because the portion of ramen is very generous but it's nice to share.  For ramen, I'm loyal to the OG Morris but I like to substitute short rib for the pork belly. Both are delicious but the short rib is less fatty and seems to go well with the broth. The broth is rich and primal and perfect for a winter day. If I'm feeling realllly wild, I'll also get an extra ajitama (marinated egg) because they're outstanding and I'm always worried about rationing it for the entire meal.  The Spicy ramen is also great (but it can be very spicy).   Side note: There isn't a great place to stand while waiting for a table so we usually put our name in and head to Lucille for a drink."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit! Very friendly service and fun vibe. Complimentary hot tea on a cold night was a very nice welcome. The namesake Morris ramen has a satisfying depth of flavor and comes with slices of tender pork belly. Try the ice cream sandwich if you're in the mood for dessert."}
{"text":"I'm new to Ramen so I tried a few different Ramen places and Morris Ramen stood out! The flavor was distinct and separate from all the ingredients, not all infused together. Sapporo on tap was a plus and the music was soft 70s stuff that made the meal.Nice place!!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for ramen in Madison. Granted, I haven't had Ramen Kid yet which I've heard is another Madison-ramen staple but I haven't felt the need to venture to Ramen Kid since Morris is walking distance from my apartment, has a wonderful atmosphere, and consistently solid food.   I really love the decor of the place: it's simple but stylish, dimly lit but not too dark, and seems as authentically Japanese as you'll get in Madison. I have had the Morris Ramen which was yummy, with tender pork and a perfectly soft-boiled egg. I've also had the beef donburi which was a good sized portion and also very flavorful. I love treating myself to a bowl of their food on a cold day - nothing like a good bowl of ramen to warm you up."}
{"text":"Had the spicy ramen; it was done perfectly, would not change a thing. Looking forward to getting back again to try other things on the menu. Cool atmosphere, cozy and dimly lit as one would expect from a Japanese style noodle house. Probably the best ramen that you will be able to experience in Madison. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful full-bodied veggie miso ramen with really interesting ingredients and flavors. Very cool sesame shochu. Dark svelte intimate interior."}
{"text":"Shinji Muramoto, a late comer to the ramen craze, has a winner here. Each of the ramen dishes are excellent - my favorite is Morris, a pork ramen. For something lighter, try the spicy ramen.   The menu and drink list are small, but thoughtful and focused on quality. The cocktails feature refreshing, subtle flavors. The Smoking Jacket has a nice touch of Scotch. The spiced pear saketini is a favorite.   Satsuma fries with gochujang aioli - sweet potato fries with a spicy aioli - make an nice first course paired with the not too spicy kimchi and pickled okra.   Atmosphere was casual.  Service was friendly and fast, but not rushed. No reservations are taken, and the 40 seats fill up by 6 pm so go early or be patient. The bill for 2 came to $60, including drinks and starters."}
{"text":"I got the bowl of Morris Ramen and a beef bun, both of which were pretty good. I have to admit that I did not expect this level of ramen in Madison, so I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Ramen was really delicious as was the pork bun. I love Brussels sprouts so they were a must, delicious flavor. I was also amazed how great the ramen tasted as leftovers, which is not always common. We tried a few other buns and they were good but the pork bun definitely stuck out. Pretty sure you can't go wrong with any of the ramen choices!"}
{"text":"Loved it.... and I thought Ramen noodles were just a college thing! Not here... excellent extras to throw in and create your own meal... and it's quite a meal!"}
{"text":"Love the Morris ramen! Great customer service, I haven't met an employee who wasn't nice. I wish they served lunch during the weekend!"}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions. It's a great cozy spot, though the downside of \"cozy\" often means a wait for a table. If your group is small, there's usually a quicker seating up at the bar. The ramen is great and flavorful, though occasionally, it's a bit too heavy to finish the whole bowl. The steamed buns are of the extra large variety, great initially, but once you dig in, you start questioning your investment. The large lily pad buns tend to be oversteamed and a bit gummy, and there's usually an imbalance between bun/meat/pickled veg ratio, as compared to the smaller buns that I'm more accustomed to. The rice bowls are nicely portioned and very filling. Only thing I really wish is that they have a bit more variety in the flavors they offer, i.e. the pork in the buns taste the same as the pork in the rice bowls, so if you got both of those, you essentially only have one dish you're eating. Overall, best place for ramen that Madison's got to offer. Don't bother with the other places."}
{"text":"I had the Morris Ramon and can't wait to try the spicy Ramon. The staff was wonderful, and I loved the atmosphere. We will call this our go to Ramon place for sure."}
{"text":"Our group of four tried Morris Ramen for dinner this past weekend. We arrived around 7:00 pm but they were able to get us seated with only a short wait. In general I recommend getting reservations since this is a small space. It resides in the old Red Sushi location, so if you're familiar with that you'll know what I mean. Seating includes bar chairs, a row of tables opposite and a small row of tables in front of the window. The decor has Asian overtones but is not overdone. One unusual feature was that instead of chairs, in the aisle they had pretty wooden crates to sit on. Convenient for storage and clean-up, they were comfortable enough for a meal but I'm not sure if I would want to sit on them for an extended time period.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. We enjoyed that she went through the menu and identified any ingredients we might not be familiar with. She provided excellent service throughout.  The menu consists of ramen dishes, appetizers, and buns. Our group ordered 3 ramens (Morris, Spicy, and Veggie Miso) as well as Chashu Donbury which was a rice bowl w/protein, a sauce, and a hard-boiled egg. We also tried the beef and chicken buns, and sides of pickles and seaweed salad. For drinks, they offer a few cocktails, sakes, tap beers and wines. The tasty Zoop Dogg was a mix of gin and sake. I liked the flavor of the 'Cabin In the Snow' sake, but was disappointed that it was $9 for one cup, not one carafe. I found the price of the ramen to be a little bit high as well considering the bowls were not very full. However, the ramen broth and the texture of the noodles easily made this the best ramen we've had in Madison. The pickles appeared to be pickled shishito peppers. Both that and the small portion of seaweed salad were very reasonably priced. Chashu Donburi was delicious, good textures and flavors and also very reasonably priced. The filings of both the beef and chicken buns were tasty, but the texture of the bun itself was a little too springy for me.  If you are craving ramen, this is a good option in Madison."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen! What a pleasant surprise. Ambiance is super cool -- got a zen vibe throughout the restaurant. The ramen was a good, healthy portion -- not all broth like so many places. Quality ingredients too. Enjoyed the spicy ramen. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Madison.  It's a very simple menu of ramen and buns , and it's all good.  I've had the spicy Raman twice.  Some of the best outdoor seating around for a hot summer eve, and food beer list of local craft."}
{"text":"- Fantastic, authentic ramen - Tasty and tasteful cocktails - Elegant yet cozy decor and an unpretentious atmosphere - Efficient and friendly staff - Excellent liquor selection - Perfectly-sized menu with just the right number of choices - They carry Stillwater Extra Dry beer (the perfect light, refreshing, dry brew to go with a rich bowl of ramen--seriously, no matter what kind of beer you like, or even if you're one of those rare folks who don't like beer at all, try this)  One of the best restaurants in Madison these days, and hands-down the best ramen place."}
{"text":"Frigging amazing Ramen in Wisconsin of all places.  Do I normally give 5 stars?  Uhh check my other reviews."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend from Chicago and was looking up ramen places on yelp here in Madison and I came upon Morris Ramen which was labeled \"hot and new\" so I took a chance and came here and what an amazing choice. I got the Morris ramen and the noodles are the best, so flavorful and the broth is rich but still has a great balance. I would def come back to this place if I was ever in Madison."}
{"text":"I have to say... Morris Ramen is pretty legit. Our server, Sidney brought us the Morris Ramen bowl tonight. The broth was incredibly flavorful yet light to the stomach. The ramen itself had a nice chew to it (like what you would find in Japan). Everything tasted perfect and we were treated very well by the staff. I would have to say, this is by far the best ramen I've had in Madison!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Perfect for the cold weather c: the broth was delicious, you can tell how much time they put into it and the meat was cooked to perfection. Bao were so fluffy and inventive. Staff was so friendly and helpful and everything came out quickly for a weekend dinner. Great sake collection too. Atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the design is spot on. They really put thought into everything you could think of."}
{"text":"After eating here one time, I was so blown away by the quality of the experience that I simply had to create an account to let the world know that Morris Ramen is an absolute gem! The vegetarian miso ramen is loaded with vegetables swimming in an impressively hearty and flavorful broth. The ambiance manages to pull of both chic and welcoming, and the open kitchen lends a wonderful warmth and approachability to the place. Our waitress was a delight, and it was one of the few restaurants I've been to in the US where I didn't feel rushed by the staff to order, eat, and depart as efficiently as possible. Bonus: the King Street neighborhood has a number of interesting bars and nightlife options, so you can easily marry dinner with postprandial fun without having to walk far. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when business brought me to the nearby Concourse. I've never had traditional Japanese ramen, and this was an absolute treat!!   The menu was a little more limited than I expected, but again - don't know anything about ramen. I'm a vegetarian, and they had a great veggie option with veg broth soup base and all kinds of yummy veggies. I opted for the ginger sesame marinated hard boiled egg add-on, and it was interestingly yummy.   The server was very eclectic and kind. We told him right away we knew nothing about the menu, so he jumped in with explanations and suggestions, including spice levels and ideas for \"first timers.\"  In addition to the ramen, we tried the \"buns,\" which were like little Japanese sliders - doughy buns filled with squash, yogurt, and herbs. YUM again!   Upon first walking into the place, it surprised us by being a bit small, dark, and edgy feeling. We didn't realize they had outdoor seating, but we were offered a seat on the patio out back and it was lovely!"}
{"text":"Love!  First time there and what joy!  The broth was so flavorful.  Noodles were the perfect al dente, and yummy add-ons. My only request is that you expand the menu around the edges- drinks and desserts especially."}
{"text":"Came in and caught the tail end of their happy hour, which meant a ramen and a PBR tall boy for $15.  I ordered the Morris Ramen and was really satisfied with it. The broth was excellent, noodles were just the right chewiness, the egg yolk perfectly done, and the meat was deliciously tender.   It's easy to walk right past this place on King Street as they don't have really big signage  but make sure you dont miss it! In my opinion, Morris has the lead for best ramen in Madison."}
{"text":"This place has the best ramen in Madison. I've tried Ramen Kid, Umami, and Morris, and there is no question. Yes, the other places are decent, but Morris is on another level. Their ramen rivals the best ramen in the Bay Area. They know what they're doing. Trust them.  Try the Morris Ramen for a rich, fatty broth. Try the Miso Ramen if you want something saltier, though this broth is more difficult to drink all of. They are also very easygoing about making substitutions if you prefer another type of meat or another veggie in the same bowl. Great options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans alike."}
{"text":"Maybe I got unlucky but I felt pretty disappointed with my experience. I had pretty high expectations but the food and service fell flat for me.   We ordered an appetizer of fries, which came with gochujang. They were a decent start to the meal, and were either yam or sweet potato fries, the menu didn't specify. The Morris ramen was so salty that it covered up the taste of of the creamy pork broth. My friend's miso ramen was pretty salty as well. The chashu pork was pretty good, but there was only one piece. The egg was delicious though, best part of the ramen. Other than that, just some bamboo shoots and scallion for toppings. I feel like it's too expensive and small for the quality, at $13 a bowl for the Morris ramen.   I will say though, the one thing that is bumping this to a 3 is their donburi- I had it with the beef short rice and it was delicious! Meat marinated and cooked perfectly, and combined with rice and onions and the egg that also goes in the ramen. If I ever come back, that's what I'll be ordering.   Otherwise, the service was also slow, which combined with the mediocre ramen just made sad :("}
{"text":"Our new favorite Friday night dinner spot!  The Morris is my favorite and if the Spicy is too hot for you, try the Morris with a side spicy bomb.  Tried that one last night, you can add as much or as little spice as you like.  Great job guys!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Nothing extraordinary but it was definitely worth our time. It's very hidden and quaint, but almost too quaint. You won't go 3 steps without walking into someone, and you'll basically be a part of your neighbors conversation. Despite this, the ambiance is nice and you'll definitely get your money's worth of food."}
{"text":"I've been craving good ramen for months now, so when I was finally in a bigger city (for the Midwest) we did our research and came upon this place. So, first things first: the featured Yelp photo is of fries. What the heck is that about? No diss on the person who took the photo, but we almost passed based on that alone. AND, to make matters worse, we had just watched a Food Network episode on ramen in Japan, so...let's just say my expectations were a little skewed.   Second things second: THE PORK BUN. The pork bun was delicious. It's the size my hand and piled thickly with tender, melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly. The bf and I split one and it has been the best thing we've eaten in the 24 hours that we've been in Madison (not saying much, I know). But still. We wish we had gotten two of these and shared a bowl of ramen instead of sharing one bun and each having our own ramen.   Third things third: we both got the Morris ramen with modifications. The first bites were tasty. And then...just became heavy. The broth is really, really thick and only became more congealed as the seconds ticked away. The only other tonkotsu I've had that compared in fatty consistency is that of Mensho Tokyo in Downtown SF (which starts at $17/bowl). I'm not entirely sure it's a good thing. Now, I know that all good ramen starts with a heaping cauldron of pork and chicken carcasses, but sometimes you have to draw the line at fatty enough and coat-your-lips fatty.   This has been the only bowl of ramen in my life that I couldn't finish, aside from the one time I was sick with bronchitis and another time in which I spilled a bowl in college."}
{"text":"I really enjoy my dinner. I had the chicken chashu donburi, which was quite good. We were there pretty late on a weekday, so the place was pretty quiet. It had a relaxing cozy vibe which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"The ramen here was pretty good. The only issue for me was that the Morris Ramen I ordered was too sweet AND I couldn't make it spicy enough. I even paid for a habenero paste, but that didn't do the job. Lastly, I would say it's a bit overpriced, a bowl of ramen here will go for close to 16 dollars (Morris ramen 13, bowl cho 1, spicy sauce 1, tax 1.50)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Got their buns twice and the ramen once. This place is very cute, quiet, and cozy. The buns are really good (average is 4 stars), the pork ones are amazing (5 stars, juicy and tasty). I found the ramen to be too salty (3 stars) and now I only order a couple of buns when I go. They often have beer deals, which is quite appreciated. Overall a nice place, but nothing incredible."}
{"text":"Modern and cozy atmosphere with soft lighting.  Felt warm and welcoming.  The wait may be an hour or more and it's worth it!  The craft cocktails are strong and delicious, the portions are generous, and the staff was friendly.  Would go again!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen. I had the Morris- Chashu Pork Belly, Ajitama, (marinated egg), Menma (fermented bamboo shoots), which I was very satisfied with. The pork broth was thick and full of flavor, the noodles were great (we saw them massaging them before cooking!), the bamboo shoots added an interesting texture to the dish, and the best was the marinated egg. The egg was probably the most perfect ajitama I've had. It was marinated to just the right amount of saltiness and flavor, and the egg yolk was like a translucent custard. I was savoring each bite of the egg.   It is easy to miss the entrance as I didn't see a huge sign board. It was dark and cozy inside, kind of had a hipsterish vibe. Good service too."}
{"text":"Spicy Ramen is the Best..hands down. Tried the Spicy Miso it was good... But Wow the Spicy is the Bomb!!! Service is great, bar stools a little clumsy to maneuver and restaurant is a little small but fine at lunch time.  4stars for everything else..5 stars  for the Spicy Ramen   Buns are great as well"}
{"text":"This place was great,  I had the Morris Ramen and a beef bun.  I did order a pork bun as I wanted to try the sweet and salty that the waiter discussed but my order got messed up and was happy to try the beef.  It was good, not spicy as described but I was still happy with the mixup.  There are some other things on the menu I would like to try and will be back again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. Pork belly is very tasty. Fatty, butt hats to be expected. Seaweed salad good. Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I guess everyone has a different preference in terms of complaining about the saltiness but I think it tastes absolutely delicious with the amount of salt; gives it more flavor, but then again I love salt so it's perfect for me. I hope you don't cut out the salt because your ramen is still my favorite so far."}
{"text":"Went twice. Menu was not impressive, cost was a little high. Soup was good, but not super, as the price suggested. If you are going to highlight the cheapest food known to Americans over the past 3 decades, it better be damn friggen impressive.  This simply was ok."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... It's ramen, how good can it be? Well, it's that slurping good!!!   My wife and I sat at the bar because we always find it enjoyable to share our dining experience with others. To start, we ordered the pork bun which was a harmonious balance of sweet and salty. Next, I dove into the Morris Ramen! Wow! It's a ramen broth mixed with noodles, pork belly and a soft poached egg which translates into heaven for your stomach! Finally, my wife ordered the Veggie Miso and added the beef short ribs. At first, I thought it was strange to add meat to a vegetarian dish, but the combination actually worked well together. The veggie broth was full of flavor and the short ribs were extremely tender.   Put on a shirt you don't mind getting slurp stains on and get to Morris Ramen!"}
{"text":"Things were great except RAMEN. Noodle was okay, but soup was rather oily, not savory."}
{"text":"Really good broth, and I'm giving it 5 stars because it is the best I've found in Madison. I tried the classic pork belly ramen - would have liked it hotter in temperature - but it was still  delicious. Velvety pork, chirashi egg and ramen with just the right amount of push against the teeth.   I plan on going back for the other ramens and will update this after, but still a firm recommend if looking for a place to eat downtown or if ramen committed."}
{"text":"OMG! The Spicy ramen is sooooo good! Add the sliced ribeye, you won't be disappointed! The service is top notch! Loved being able to see them make my ramen."}
{"text":"All around success! Drinks were good, apps enjoyable, and ramen amazing. Everyone (8 people) enjoyed their meals very much. We started with the fries and buns, which were very tasty. I had the miso ground pork ramen, and loved it! I also got to try the Morris ramen and spicy ramen. Both were also excellent, but not as good as the miso ramen. A couple people ordered the short rib donburi. I was told it was good but didn't compare to the ramen. I fully recommend and will be back. Also should add that the service was wonderful! They were knowledgeable and the food came out exactly as fast as you'd want it."}
{"text":"We love Morris Ramen. We've been here a few times for date night and it's perfect. My boyfriend loves the Morris Ramen bowl. The spicy ramen was my favorite, it had the perfect amount of heat and the flavor was to die for. Perfect with a shot of soju! The atmosphere here is awesome, relaxed with good vibes and cool customers."}
{"text":"Shinji Muramoto does it again with another down-to-earth place with amazing food and cocktails, high both on creativity and execution.  Excellent cocktails that pair well with the flavors of the food (I had the Smoking Jacket, which was a smoky-citrusy delight).  The spicy ramen was excellent and a less-rich alternative to the delicious Morris ramen.  The spice wasn't overwhelming and was complex.  The ramen noodles had excellent texture.  Service was efficient but not rushed, even with a full house.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really loved my first experience at Morris Ramen!   The first thing I want to mention is that there seems to be no signage for the restaurant outside, so it is kind of hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. The door (to the left of the tapestry-covered window) is painted black and just looks like a regular apartment building door.  Once you get inside, though, the interior is so welcoming! Especially on a damp and chilly Wisco evening. You immediately smell the enticing aroma of Ramen wafting through the cozy restaurant, and you know that *this is worth it* even though you walked past the door three times in the rain trying to find the place.   I ordered the Morris Ramen and the Bulleit Lime No. 5 and my dad got the Miso Ramen and Spiced Pear Saketini. The egg in the ramen is just as good as everybody says it is. I have also heard that the wings, satsuma fries, and spicy ramen are amazing and I am excited to go back again and try them. I also thought the house cocktails were great.  This seems like a fun place for apps with friends before going out downtown, cozying up with a date for dinner, or a late night snack. My only wish is that their hours were a little more flexible, but I think that will probably come with time, since they opened still relatively recently."}
{"text":"Had the Morris ramen with extra soft boil egg, the ramen is the most authentic I have tasted in Madison. Am very pleased with that. Tried the pork bun, it was absolutely delicious. The dessert orange ice cream sandwich has very great texture and taste. Overall wonderful experience. Great service. Modern looking. Well done !"}
{"text":"It pains me to give Morris 5 stars because it was our secret plan to open a Ramen restaurant where Morris opened.  However, I can't give it anything less because they get an: A+ in execution & consistency A+ in taste & richness A+ for Chashu Pork (duh) A+ for service -  came in at 10 minutes to close one night for late night Ramen and was greeted SO welcomingly, when obviously I was in the wrong for coming in so late.    I've ordered the OG - Morris Ramen -  I'd recommend everyone try it once.  Pro tip - sub out the standard noodles with the \"fat noodles\" or the \"spicy ramen noodles.\"  The thick noodles is my personal favorite and has that awesome bite you want from Ramen. It'd not advertised, but you can get a spicy bomb on the side if you are really craving Spicy Ramen.  I'd recommend that over their spicy ramen because I think that way you're getting the rich chicken bone broth (I think) with your own ability to control the spice level.  I ordered the spicy ramen once, but thought that the spice overwhelmed everything else and it was less satisfying.   The pork buns - little pillows of tastebud delight.  --to quote my dad: Wow - these are really good.  how did they get it to be so good?   You might deduct some things for the sides being a bit pricey, but I think they've done some recent adjustments to make it fairly priced."}
{"text":"Ramen is very overrated (definitely not worth of a 4.5 star)- having tried ramen from every part of the US and a lot of Asia, I will say that the ramen here is a bit better than passing-by Asian restaurants that happen to serve \"ramen\" but definitely not the same caliber as the higher ranked ramen around the nation. Noodles are slightly overcooked (a little mushier than bouncy), broth is MUCH too salty rather than letting the rich tonkatsu flavor come out. The chasu (pork) pieces themselves are very well done, a good balance of fat, tender lean meat, and flavor. Overall just a 3/5."}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen, great service, and tasty cocktails. The ramen was very flavorful, and very fast. The buns were good size and also great. Glad to see something new come into that space and be unique and all around good."}
{"text":"In Madison for a night and decided to try this Ramen place. When I arrived around 6:00 PM there wasn't any wait and I was seated at the bar. By the time I left around 7:00 there was a line out the door.  Ramen was delicious. Only real negative comment is that the broth was really really hot. Much more so than other places I have been to. Otherwise Chashu was great, very flavorful and the noodles were perfect. Service was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"*this review is based on service experience,  not food.   Dear Morris Ramen,  I came to you on the afternoon of 9/8/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)  I arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server \"is this taken care of?\" She says \"yes\".   Later I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me \"they said they don't do that\".   It has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer.   I am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems. I was later identified as this person and no action was taken. It was not only embarrassing but unprofessional."}
{"text":"I have been there several times at various times (lunches and dinners) and with various companions (kids and grown-up friends?) and I have to say it was on point every time. Everyone loved their food. I'm vegetarian and had lots of options, my co-diners being omnivores, also loved the choices. They vegetarian ramen is one of the best in town. The tofu stuffed pillow is amazing! My kids are serious ramen aficionados? and rank this  one #1 in town. The appetizers options were also fun their buns are really delicious. I wasn't 100% about the veggie bun but the meat buns were described as perfect. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've always had good luck with this place and wonderful service. It's a bit cramped in here and I wouldn't recommend it for large parties. I usually get regular ramen but my friend got their veggie option and really liked it. They always have hot fresh tea which is perfect for the cold snaps that seem to last until May in Madison."}
{"text":"I was sad to see Ted leave this spot until I tried Morris. Staff is great. The ramen is hot and tasty. I come here regularly for lunch and as the weather turns cooler I'll be looking forward to stopping more often. Nice simple decor sets a nice mood."}
{"text":"Great Ramen, decent drinks. Would go again but not \"wowed\" enough with the food to give 5 stars. Very good service."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Morris ramen so was excited to finally check it out. The atmosphere as others have mentioned was nice and cozy although I could see how that might make it fill up fast.  Luckily we went on a quiet Monday night so had no problems getting a table. The waiter was friendly although I could've used a little more attentive water refills or a pitcher for the table! The menu is pretty small and we definitely had to google quite a few words. I ended up with the Morris ramen with bok choy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food that came out- it was definitely a hearty meal, however I thought the broth was a bit too salty.  The rest of the components were good (noodles well cooked, the pork was tender) but I found myself fishing out the components by the end to avoid the broth."}
{"text":"Darn this place!  My first visit (shortly after they opened) was so great - delicious, fun atmosphere and unique menu.  My most recent visit less than 2 weeks ago revealed a slightly less refined experience.  We started with two appetizers - the pork & beef bao buns and the satsuma fries. The buns were crazy delicious!  Each adorned with unique condiments and flavors - so good.  Fries were kinda over cooked - overly chewy and crispy but the gochujiang aioli was killer. I was almost mad at the fries for not being a better compliment to the awesome sauce.  We both ordered the Morris Ramen with a few add ins - extra bok choy, some deep fried tofu thing and beef short ribs.  While each individual item was delicious, the ramen broth was crazy salty.  Like way too salty.  Like I felt like I was going to have a heart attack after eating it salty.  Boo.  I'm guessing that the salt levels differ from chef to chef, night to night but it was a huge turn off. I'd probably go back and focus on just the buns and maybe try another ramen bowl to see if I have better luck with a different broth.    Oh and keep the water refills flowing - you're gonna need it!"}
{"text":"The spicy ramen was a little salty for my taste buds. There is endless possibilities and ingredients that can go into a bun, however at this place it was very disappointing. The shiso went well with the rib eye bun, however another ingredient or texture would've of balance it out or char grilling it. The chicken bun needs a new upgrade it was heavily saucy and the lettuce wasn't working out for me. It just reminded me of a mc chicken sandwich from the dollar menu."}
{"text":"Baby it's cold outside! And what better way to warm you up (body and soul!) than with some Ramen? Honestly, I'm not a huge Ramen fan. It's very hit or miss for me. But THIS: what a hit it was. I was satisfied from the very first taste to the very last.   WARNING: I've heard tell that their Ramen is too salty.. perhaps that was true in the past, or perhaps I just have a high tolerance for salt? You be the judge. I will say that they make the dishes right in front of you, so you have ample opportunity to curate your own ramen experience. Let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like them, but they were just okay.   I've been in this space in several of its different incarnations, when it was a Kushi Bar, a east/west BBQ joint, etc. The decor hasn't changed much, but it was already a charming spot. I ordered the Morris Ramen. My partner ordered the Spicy Ramen, and my sistered ordered the Veggie Ramen. I liked the Veggie Ramen, but the broth lacked a bit of depth for me. I found the Morris Ramen broth rather oily, and I wasn't really a fan.    We also ordered appetizers or buns, with a pork bun and a squash bun. The bun itself was just okay. It lacked the fresh steaming softness of a bun, but the fillings were delicious and well done.   I really liked the fact that on the menu, you can buy a round for the kitchen for $10. I like that it's priced, and I wish more places did that. The service was friendly and attentive. We sat at the bar.   I do have one gripe: several of the chefs handled food without gloves, including cooked food that they then put right onto a bowl of ramen to be served. It made me a little iffy."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time the other day with my partner and we both rated it a 3. Despite having been to Red Sushi's previous location once and knowing my way around the area I still found it hard to find - a large sign outside would be helpful. The service is good and the waiters are nice. In terms of the ramen bowls, I ordered the veggie ramen while my partner ordered the Morris ramen. After trying other ramen restaurants in Madison I had high expectations for this place (although definitely a long shot) - unfortunately it was a rather mediocre experience.  My partner and I both agreed that the broth was very bland for the veggie and morris ramen.  I may have also overdid it by putting too much of the chili pepper shichimi in my broth to give it more flavor but it still did nothing. And I don't really know how much of a difference it would have been had I gotten the spicy ramen bowl. Regardless, both dishes were lacking depth of flavor. The noodles are okay, the egg soft-boiled was well cooked and the vegetables were good. I would agree with one of the reviewers, the broth and sometimes the noodles are usually what makes it or breaks it for me as well.   I would also like to mention that the edamame we got was cold - I'm sure that was purposeful but I usually prefer my edamame either boiled or steamed. The seaweed salad is like any other you can find at a Japanese restaurant. Not really impress with the appetizers. The menu's a little pricey but expected. I don't particularly care for this place but for others who are new to the ramen scene it may be worth a try."}
{"text":"Simple yet nice atmosphere. Got the spicy ramen which was fantastic but it was the beef buns that pushed this to a 5 star rating! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen place in Madison. The menu is pretty simple and most of the ramen dishes are pretty good. You can feel the umami taste in it but not so significant that will wow you. The restaurant is a bit small so if you can make a reservation, I would recommend so. The portion is pretty big so you will definitely get your money worth. I do think everything is decently priced"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a delicious meal at Morris Ramen. I got the Miso Ramen with ground pork and corn. Soooo savory and delicious! She got the Morris Ramen with fatty pork and marinated eggs. Needless to say, we both had hearts for eyes as we were slurping down our noodles and broth. She gave me a piece of her pork and DAMN, that's the best chashu pork I've ever had- v tender and smooth. It was great to be able to sit outside, but the patio is right next to a cigar lounge. So if you're sensitive to smoke, opt inside! The servings here are plenty to take home, but don't be surprised when you go into your fridge the next day to find your ramen is solid. It is extremely fatty broth- HA, I know your secret, Morris Ramen! Buuuut it's still delicious heated up and back in soup form. So whatever. I'll be baaaaaaack!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Ramen in Madison. I prefer their broth and noodles over Ramen Kid and Umami. Ramen Kid I like because they have a poke station if you don't want ramen and their ramen isn't bad. Umami's ramen is flavorful as well, and comes in a close second. When going to Morris, get their Morris ramen, it's the best. Also,  try their buns, any of the buns are delicious!"}
{"text":"Morris Ramen is wonderful addition to Madison's restaurant scene. We can always use some more choices when it comes to ramen, and Morris' offering is a unique one.  First of all, Morris kicks butt in the atmosphere game. The place is decorated like a Japanese izakaya straight from an anime except with moodier lighting. It feels modern, but it's not cheesy and clubby like Tavernakaya.  The next thing you notice is their menu. While it offers a creative variety of flavors, they stick to ramen, appetizers, and steamed buns, so it's not overwhelming. I was really tempted to order everything, but I convinced myself to be realistic and get chicken wings and ramen.  The wings were crispy enough with moist meat. They had a sweet garlic flavor like I would've expected from Korean-style wings. They were good, but I didn't find them to be memorable. However, the pickled radish that it comes with is so good. It's different from what I'm used to, Morris' pickled daikon has a distinct savory aspect to it along with the brininess that you'd expect from a pickle.  The ramen I chose was their Morris ramen because it seemed like their flagship ramen while being the most similar to traditional ramen. The Morris comes with chashu pork belly, ajitama (marinated egg), and menma (fermented bamboo shoots). I also added aburaage (tofu skin pouch). To be honest, I found the toppings to be pretty run-of-the-mill. The aburaage, however, was an awesome addition! The tofu skin pouch was filled with finely-chopped Asian root vegetables. It soaks up broth like a sponge, and it's a fun new way to get your vegetables in for the day.  That brings me to me next observation: the broth. This broth is awesome! It's tonkotsu, but it's not the heavy, creamy tonkotsu broth that you might expect. The broth is definitely packed with pork bone flavor, but it's a little lighter. You can taste a lot of traditional dashi ingredients like dried bonito and kombu seaweed. Somehow, it tastes kind of smoky too. It's heavenly!  With great food, a great location, and a decent drink selection, I definitely see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the last ramen place in Madison until another pops out, and the ramen is certainly inferior to ramen kid and ramen station. The noodles are tough and not ramen quality, jeez. The soup is bland. Meats are tasteless. Ssamjjang and perilla leaf in the bun don't go well at all, not to mention that it's culturally wrong, unless this is a fusion restaurant(?). The only reason I gave it two instead of one star is because of the good service."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for a 5PM dinner with no wait. I like the new decor of the place with the wood panels surrounding the space. Service was good and the waitress welcomed us to flag her down since the space is so small.   We ordered the following:  Morris Ramen: The egg was cooked perfectly but on the colder side which I imagine was pre-prepared but should have been heated up a little more before serving. The pork belly was also very delicious with a good ratio of fat to meat. I was underwhelmed by the broth, but still tasty. I wanted the spicy broth but was not a fan of chicken. Wish there was a spicy pork belly option.   Chicken wings: We had to send these back. They were described as fried which made me think of Korean Fried Chicken, but the wings are closer to boiled chicken. The seasoning was so light, I could barely taste it and I didn't think the paired sauce (spicy mayo-like) paired well. The pickled vegetables were standard.   Satsuma Fries: We enjoyed these and were appreciative they gave us extra after sending back the wings! Fries were crispy and the aioli was good (wish there was more with it).  Black Sesame Malt: Dessert was quite tasty! I enjoyed the brittle on top the most and brought out crunch crunch and flavor to the malt!  Overall the food was OK and the atmosphere was great, but nothing dying to come back to. If I need a ramen fix, I would still probably go to Ramen Station."}
{"text":"Yet another ramen place in Madison, and this one definitely takes the cake. Or almost - whether it's better than the other good ramen places in Madison is a matter of taste. I, for one, appreciate the hefty bowl of flavor that is their broth, and their noodles have the proper firmness that I look for in ramen of any kind. Having been to Japan on multiple occasions, I care about my ramen.  Each ramen place in Madison has its highlight, and for me the part Morris Ramen did best was the meat. Being from Asia, I know my way around fatty pork cuts, and they do it well here. Braised to tenderness without dryness, and flavor penetrating rather than merely covering the surface of the meat. The other parts aren't anything to shy away from either - the noodles are tender but firm, and the broth is heavy both in flavor and substance. (Others have pointed out that the broth can get rather oily. I'm not too bothered by that, but it's worth noting.) And the soft-boiled egg was properly soft-boiled - solid white, nearly liquid gel-like yolk. A+  I also got their pork buns. It's the Momofuku pork bun, with the same pork belly as in the ramen, hoisin sauce, pickled veggies, folded in a steamed bun like a taco. Also A+ because the meat was solid.   Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen!! I had the Morris Ramen, the pork was cooked very tender and the broth overall flavor was balance and umami. Ramen texture was great too. This would be the Best Ramen I had in Madison."}
{"text":"Ramen done right--flavorful without being overly fatty and the noodles were cooked through but not soggy.  The spicy ramen bowl features noodles in spicy red broth, baby bok choy, and very tender chicken pieces.  The spicy bowl features just enough spice to make your nose run but you can still taste the savory ramen broth.  The menu has an array of add-ons for your ramen as well.  There are about 8 tap beers available, sake, and some hard liquors.  I had a special that included a prepackaged cup of sake as a novelty.  I don't think I'd head here just for drinking, though, as you'd have to fight off ramen slurpers who want a seat.    I will definitely be back to try another ramen bowl with more add-ons now that I can vouch that the unadorned bowl is excellent."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best ramen places in town .I tried their Morris ramen. Broth was flavorful and the pork belly was delicious ..definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I took a walk on a cold winter night and ramen was just the ticket we needed to help warm us up.  She went with the Morris while I opted for the spicy.  Overall, I felt both of our dishes were well prepared, noodles perfect cooked and portions sizes generous.  The spicy had the right amount of spice to light up your taste buds without taking over and masking the flavors of the other ingredients.  The Morris was very rich and perhaps the broth a little too fatty for my liking. The space is somewhat spartan-like (wooden crates for chairs) yet still comes off as cozy.  Service was friendly and helpful. One suggestion I would have is regarding the fabric blinds in the front window.  Due to their size, I feel that others could get an impression that it is still under construction or not open (as they are hard to see through).  Just food for thought."}
{"text":"The ramen and drinks are lit. Ice-cream sandwich is out of this world. Super friendly staff. You might get lost trying to find the place though. Look for the blue curtains with Japanese words on it. Oh and they're insanely busy, so expect a wait. It's worth"}
{"text":"Food: Smaller menu with a number of crowd pleasing offerings. I've had the spicy ramen both times I've visited and have been delighted by the smoky broth and wonderful heat of the dish. Dining companions also were happy with their offerings. The noodles are wonderfully toothsome, the broth was on point, and the toppings were fresh and tasty.   Ambiance: Pretty cozy space with like ten tables and a long bar - think there is a bit of outside seating too. The decor is nice but not too pretentious - could imagine having a nice but casual date here.   Overall: Great place for a solid bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"I feel bad being the black sheep of the Morris group of reviewers, but I was actually thoroughly disappointed after I tried this place. Came here on a weekday night after over a year of saying I would try it out and was unfortunately really disappointed. Morris is located around state street and is surprisingly a \"hole-in-the wall\"/accidentally might walk past it type of place. The inner ambience is swanky, similar to a place like Eno Vino and the menu is brief.  I tried both the Morris ramen and the Miso ramen. While the ramen noodles themselves and everything was technically and flavorfully delicious, what makes me extremely disappointed is it was definitely a salt bomb! I would compare this to the saltiness of ramen at Tavernakaya. I kept taking more bites hoping that it was just my senses going crazy, but both my SO and I drank over two glasses of water to just finish the noodles. I do understand Miso is usually saltier, but I felt the Morris ramen was also just too much. We did not have any of the broth because of the saltiness unfortunately (although the flavors were creamy and rich and well done). I was also disappointed with the amount of oil sitting on top of my ramen and just felt that for the price and for how much I heard people raving about it, I was disappointed. I definitely prefer somewhere like Ramen Kid or Umami.   I do commend our waiter for asking if we would like a container to take home the broth though (though we declined), as it was very thoughtful of him to notice!"}
{"text":"My friend and I both had the spicy ramen.  We were both very satisfied(although it was not spicy).  The only complaint I have is the humidity in the restaurant from the constant cooking of noodles with obviously poor ventilation.  We also sat at the bar because no tables have backs on their chairs.  It still falls second behind Sujeo for ramen."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place since it opened in 2016. So I finally made a trip on a Wednesday evening.  People, this ramen is fine, absolutely adequate and acceptable to pay cash money for, but please don't mistake this for amazing ramen.   Many of us have gotten through a time in our lives by surviving on Maruchan Ramen, or maybe even Ichiban, if you were feeling especially fancy. So that's the benchmark for me. If your ramen is not even as good as my old college staple, we got problems. I would say Morris is barely clearing the bar.  I tried the vegetable miso and the Morris. The Morris was fine, about what you would expect, needed more flavor, but had a nice mouthfeel to the broth. I would steer you away from the vegetable miso altogether, the broth generally lacked flavor and vegetable accoutrements had unpleasant textures that did not make for a good eating experience.  There are some other issues: 1. I do not want to sit on a box. A box in place of a chair does not make your space \"modern\" it makes for an uncomfortable sitting situation. 2. Add english in parentheticals to your menu. I love add-ins to my ramen, but if I have to keep asking what Moyashi is, I'm just going to give up. I like that they include the phonetic spelling of the Japanese names, but I also need to know what it is without Google Translate. 3. Keep my water glass full and don't leave in the middle of me asking questions! This is just part of being comfortable at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I can understand the hype around this place but it definitely was a disappointment for me. You come here for the ambience and the downtown feel, not the food that they serve. It definitely has a good bar feel.  Onto the food. People rave about the ramen here but I found it exceedingly salty. I've been to a lot of ramen places and I'd say this place is in the bottom half. In Madison I've tried umami and ramen kid and definitely enjoyed those more than this one. The broth didn't have the good meaty flavor and I just have to mention how salty it is again.  Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is nice and a good hang out, but don't come here if you're looking for authentic ramen."}
{"text":"Great food. I particularly appreciated the egg in the ramen. The atmosphere is trying a bit too hard, though (including the entrance)"}
{"text":"Love this place... I've had the Morris Ramen on both occasions. Once as is adding Bok Choy and once with beef short ribs instead of the pork belly.   I recommend the Morris Ramen as is with the pork belly with added Bok Choy.  I really enjoyed this signature dish. The signature Ginger cocktail was also very good, as was the squash bun. My usual companions both really seemed to like the Spicy Ramen. While I haven't tied this bowl it Looked good.   This is my new favorite noodle joint. The broth is rich and savory - such that one is tempted to lick the bowl."}
{"text":"I waited in line to get in Momofuku in NYC for what I thought was the best Ramen out side of Tokyo. Then I came home and found this incredible place and I think the Morris Ramen deserves the crown.   Outstanding. It warms my soul. Better then a hug from your Grandmother. Tastes like an umami ocean and with a dash of ninja tears of joy. I go here when I'm sad and wanna feel like rainbows are running through my veins."}
{"text":"I would eat at Morris Ramen every day if I could. We waited a bit for a table because the place was packed, but our meal was absolutely worth it. I had the veggie ramen (and a bun) and my parents had the spicy ramen and the morris ramen. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals which were rich, complex and flavorful. The cocktails were delicious, the atmosphere comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"As a self-declared Ramen Aficionado (I grew up on plenty of Ramen...not just the instant kind!), I felt like Madison has been lacking in decent ramen joints. In fact, I have been known to make a 3 hour trek to Chicago for a good bowl of ramen! So imagine my excitement to hear that a new ramen place has opened, and with good reviews on Yelp as well!   Initial impressions - a lot of the same faults that I found with Red Sushi. Unmarked restaurant, very small and crowded, no waiting space, and you were practically touching elbows with your fellow table neighbors. I won't hold this too much to the restaurant, as I think it is difficult to make do in such a small, high traffic space. But I do hope that once they grow in business, they move to a bigger, better location.   We arrived around 6pm on a Friday, and had about two couples in line in front of us. We waiting next to the bar for about 15 minutes before being seated at the bar. The waiter served us from behind the bar counter, and was attentive and quick. This probably wouldn't have been a good restaurant for chit chat with the server, since the atmosphere is so loud, but hey, I'm here for the ramen!   Very small menu (which makes things quick and easy). We ordered the Morris Ramen ($13), and the Miso Ramen ($12), with an extra slice of Char Siu Pork Belly($2.50). They arrived piping hot within a few minutes. The two broths were very flavorful, and the ramen noodle texture was very reminiscent of good Japanese ramen noodles - fresh, bouncy and slightly alkaline. The portion sizes, however, were a bit small for my appetite and for the price. The toppings were also a bit too simple compared to the price point - my ramen was topped with ground pork, corn, green onions and bean sprouts. I think if they were more creative with the toppings, I could see it as more justification for the price.   Overall, a very impressive, simple bowl of ramen. Nothing exceptionally fancy, but everything important (broth, noodles) was done to perfection. The only thing holding me back from granting the final star is the crowded atmosphere, unmarked location, and slightly too-small portions."}
{"text":"I was hoping to like this place more... Granted, I came just after watching the Japanese movie Tampopo which is literally about ramen so that gave me some higher expectations. To use my newfound knowledge from the movie... I think my main hangup was that the broth wasn't hot enough that you couldn't drink it straight when it came. That was probably the first thing they mention in that movie. They only have 4 types of ramen, I had the eponymous Morris. The broth was very rich and fatty. I think that's kind of a popular trend these days, though not exactly my favorite kind. The ramen noodles themselves were fine, though I personally can't tell from eating them what differentiates them from cheaper noodles elsewhere. The price is a bit higher but that's because of what goes into it, from what I've read. But from my one tasting, I can't justify the $13ish yet. A hotter ramen I think would've significantly improved my experience.  On a different note, the employees clearly enjoy working there and were joking around. Happy workers often = good food/service.  This place isn't easy to find. It's right on King St but very poorly signed. The window has dark-colored drapes that do say Morris Ramen but it's dark and you're going at night probably. I walked right by it while looking for it and my friend said we just passed it. And then I looked back and still missed it! So yes, it's that area that is unmarked and doesn't look like anything. But the interior is nice, it's like a nice Japanese inn/restaurant look."}
{"text":"Morris is very good. 10/10. The staff is super friendly and while it seems casual, I like that each staff member is encouraged to be themselves while embracing Morris as a brand. I like the vibe and I love what they did with the space. I always finish a whole bowl, even though there is definitely plenty for seconds. I could probably live on this soup. It's rich, though, and not for the weak bellied. Add brisket! Extra nori! Pickled veggies on the side! Morris is a dream."}
{"text":"PROS: Great buns, fresh ingredients, reasonable prices CONS: Too salty?  Morris Ramen is particularly difficult to rate. I enjoyed their alternative take on buns --- fluffy shells stuffed with interesting ingredients, like summer squash with yogurt chutney. My veggie miso ramen, however, was way too salty, even though the toppings were very fresh and appealing. This affected my experience a lot. Overall, I would give Morris Ramen another shot, but I may stick to buns and non-ramen next time, unless the saltiness factor can be solved."}
{"text":"I'll add to the praise for Morris Ramen; food, service and ambiance are all incredible.  On a cold winter night this is the place to be.  There is no real entry way or waiting area, but the servers did a great job of welcoming everyone.  We grabbed a cocktail and huddled in the corner for our ten minute wait.  After being seated at the bar we ordered our ramen: spicy for me and the 'morris' for my husband.  Despite the packed house our bowls we delivered in about 15 minutes and they we both steaming and beautiful.  His broth was a little greasier than I'd like (due to the pork belly), but he loved it.  My spicy was absolutely perfect: tender bok choy, earthy mushroom strips and a little heat from the broth.  The portions are generous and prices are very reasonable.  We finished our meal by splitting the ice cream sandwich (CC cookie with orange ice cream) and it was a cool refresher from the saltiness of the broth."}
{"text":"Great ramen with cool decoration and friendly people  Definitely some of the best ramen I've had  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"While I will plan to revisit this restaurant, based on the variations on the ramen theme ascribed to the menu, after trying the spicy ramen version I felt a little like someone who was supposed to hype themselves into excitement after seeing a movie with ubiquitous advertisements.  Yes, all the components were there, a spicy but not \"knock you on your @ss broth, an ample sized circular piece of chicken, noodles, mushrooms and the like.  At the end of the $13 investment, I felt like there was a relatively monochromatic flavor profile.  Noodles, after all, though necessary cannot provide more than a glutenous \"bridge\" to the other elements.  Reliable sources have told me that the pork belly version fairs better, and I will look forward to trying it.  The seaweed salad was good, and well presented-but I neglected to ask what manner of harvesting was used, as wild seaweed is known to include questionable ingredients not for consumption."}
{"text":"After dining at Morris Ramen last night, I am so glad Morris, Franceasca, and Shinji are giving a go with Morris Ramen. Morris Ramen is a welcome addition to the Madison restaurants.  We had Good service, good drinks, and the ramen broth is pretty good. My wife and I had their house and miso ramen, both broths have good flavors and the noodle was cooked just right. I wish the chashu is grilled and two pieces instead of one. We tried their chashu bao, it was not good, the bun was under steamed and chashu was not grilled.  Little disclaimer for Ramen lovers; I gave Morris Ramen 4 starts not because its out standing Ramen, but it's the best Ramen in Madison right now. If I would compare it to Ramen with LA, Chicago, NY, this would be a 3, just ok."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the limited menu, but overall had a good experience. I really liked the decor, but it was dimly lit and a little too dark for my preference. I had the Morris Ramen, the broth was full of flavor and the Chashu Pork Belly was delicious!!! We also got the satsuma fries and our server offered to bring us both of the dipping sauces: Gochujang Aioli and Kimchi Ranch. I'm not a big fan of kimchi but I really liked the kimchi ranch! I wish the bowls included more toppings (let's be real - $1.00 to add bok choy?), but I still enjoyed it and would go back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and each time it's a theme of phenomenal food, personable staff, and relaxed atmosphere.   Small menu, but I feel like it's well-curated.   I often order the morris ramen. The broth is so savory and meat is always tender and packed with flavor. Loaded with those good noodles and scallions.   Would recommend to any fellow ramen lover."}
{"text":"Not a place for Asian people who knows what Japanese ramen taste is like.  One of the worst ramen ever in my life...."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison for work, several friends and I visited Morris Ramen for dinner.  Our group of 5 was seated quickly and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The server was sweet, and answered lots of questions, and made excellent recommendations.  Would absolutely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and the best ramen option. The happy hour (ramen + featured beverage) for $15 has to be the best deal on the square"}
{"text":"I stopped in at 11am when they opened and ordered the Morris Raman. I was the only customer at the time and had a good conversation with Morris about Raman.  Really nice guy.    I prefer this Raman more than the other Raman places I've tried in town.  The broth made from half chicken and half pork.  Morris says it takes him 14 hours to prepare the stock.  Saltiness is just right.  Noodles were good.  My favorite part of the bowl is the pork belly.  Super tender yet holds its shape.  I asked Morris what else I should order the next time I dropped by and he recommended his favorite: Miso Raman."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch last week with a friend. The place is pretty hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. Someone told me that it is located where Red Sushi used to be so I was able to find the door pretty quickly but my friend had some trouble. We sat down and the waiter brought us some complimentary tea. I ordered the Morris ramen and while the flavor was decent, nothing about it really stood out to me. Most ingredients in the bowl were cooked well - the noodles al-dente, the pork tender, and the egg soft-boiled. However, like all other ramen establishments in Madison, the broth lacked the depth of flavor that you'd expect with a really well-cooked bowl of ramen, especially at the $13 price point. The broth is the thing that usually makes or breaks the bowl for me so while the flavor was decent, I wasn't super impressed.  I'll add that since there aren't any amazing ramen places in Madison, I'd still suggest coming here or Ramen Station if you want to scratch your ramen itch but don't want to drive all the way to Chicago for the good stuff."}
{"text":"We came and the place was packed. We had to leave our cell number with the hostess and she said she would call us in about 20 minutes or so when a table was ready. It was about 45 minutes. This place is not only really small, but really popular. The ramen itself is pretty good priced. It comes in these huge bowls. My daughter had the veggie ramen with tofu and enjoyed it much. The youngest had the Miso ramen with ground pork. Also tasty The hubby had the spicy ramen with chicken and I tried some of his broth. It was really spicy to me but he loved it. Mine was the pork belly ramen or the Morris ramen. Again, awesomesauce! They have some sides like edamame and sea weed salad as well as drink specials. I am glad we used Yelp to find this place. It was really close to our hotel."}
{"text":"This place had too long of a wait on Saturday night and I personally didn't think it was worth waiting 40 minutes just to have a bowl of ramen. It didn't meet our expectations but was fine.  They let you substitute items but screwed up by forgetting to include mushrooms in my bowl.  They have good sake at least."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!   Morris is MUCH better than Umami in my opinion. Better quality food, cheaper prices...but like other people mention, this place is pretty hard to find! There isn't really a good sign and it's just a...black door. But once you find the place, you're definitely in for a treat! This is definitely comparable to some of the better ramen shops I've had in bigger cities like SF and LA.   I tried the Spicy Ramen and it was greaaaat! The appetizers were also surprisingly delicious. The fries were great and the pork belly bun was phenomenal - definitely wasn't expecting that from a ramen place!  Overall, definitely recommend this place. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I'm moving out of Madison soon and I don't know what I'll do without Morris!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, and super friendly staff.  My biggest impression of Morris Ramen is that they care a lot about making an authentic, high-quality meal. You can watch the staff give really careful attention to each bowl that comes out. I had the chance to speak with Matt Morris (the restaurant's namesake) who was busy behind the bar preparing the bowls. He was super friendly, and seemed really eager to make a great dining experience for every guest. He even told me this great story about where he got the gigantic knife he uses.   We went at around 6pm on a Monday night, and we were immediately seated (we chose the bar). We ordered the Satsuma Fries as an appetizer. If you've never had satsuma fries, they are very similar to sweet potato fries (a bit milder in flavor than the typical bright-orange American yam, but the same texture). They came with a really addicting, mildly spicy sauce.  I ordered a beer (they have Sapporo on tap) and my girlfriend ordered the Spiced Pear Saketini, which was tasty. It has a slight anice-y flavor, which I'm typically not a huge fan of but the balance of it worked really well here.  We both ordered the Morris Ramen, and I got mine with Nori (seaweed) and Kikurage (thinly sliced, small mushrooms). The noodles had a great firm texture, and the broth was fantastic. It was incredibly flavorful. The pork was fine, but I'm not sure that I would have missed it if it wasn't there. I'm glad I added the additional mushrooms and nori, but it wasn't essential to the experience.  I'm definitely going back. Delicious, filling soup to warm you on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Literally flawless. Their veggie ramen is the best I've ever had, and certainly, easily better than the other ramen joints in Madison. The owners seem incredibly competent and kind, and they look like they enjoy their work.  Ambiance is A+. They did wonders with the decor (much better than it was). The background music has always been just to my liking.   Not much more I need to say. Go!"}
{"text":"Finally! Quality ramen in Madison if not the best! After a year-long search for such a bowl, I can say Madison has a place that can stand up to my favorite joints in Chicago.  I ordered the Morris ramen whereas my SO ordered the Spicy ramen. The Morris was your tried and true tonkotsu-style-- rich and hearty. And after swiping my SO's baby bok choy, I realized the Spicy was a tantanmen! Tantanmen is my absolute favorite and in general is hard to come by. Finding such a well done bowl in Madison is a blessing. The noodles are made in-house, which I respect so much (and should be advertised!), and I also appreciate how the bowls aren't over cluttered with toppings. 3 toppings for each ramen.  Though I have no complaints about what I ate, the vague, minimalist menu irked me. The names of the bowls are tell-nothing titles and then the ingredients listed underneath are inconsequential Japanese words. The 4 Japanese words I look for at a ramen shop are: tonkotsu, miso, shoyu and shio. I only saw 1 of 4. Thankfully I can make an educated guess when it comes to ramen, but even then it slipped pass me that the Spicy was tantanmen when first ordering. This restaurant would be a true gem if it educated its patrons about the glorious world of ramen.  Either way I highly recommend you go out of your way to eat here!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the Morris (house) ramen has good flavor, not overly salty. Service was decent.   Ordered bok choy in the ramen which was not properly cleaned, had some dirt still inside. Server apologised and we asked it to be removed from our bill, which they agreed to.   Also ordered the pork bun which was tasty...kind of like bbq rib meat on a yeast roll. Will return but will skip the bok choy next time ;)"}
{"text":"It was challenging to find this place at first, the door and the sign were both hidden from us. First off, I really like their interior and how they have those wooden stools. The design and vibe are relaxing. I got the Morris Ramen, hand down to the best ramen I've ever had. Their noodles made in-house and they have perfect texture. The broth is flavorful and thick, I like that it is not too salty. The bamboo is a nice touch to the noodles. Marinated pork belly is delicious, it comes with two thick cut.  Service is fast and friendly, she answers all of our questions.  I would recommend the restaurant to put a little description of the add-ons or the ingredients. For a person who does not have much knowledge about ramen, I would appreciate the description."}
{"text":"I took my friend here while I was very sick. It was amazing!! The portions are huge for the price, the atmosphere is amazing, and the location is so cool.  The place looks like a hole in the wall without a sign, but don't be scared! Walk in the door and find a little place that looks like you stepped into Japan. A giant bowl of ramen came out for both of us. I had the vegetarian ramen. It was delicious and rich!  It was busy, and there is no area to wait. So probably not great for walk-in groups or babys. But it's perfect for taking a friend or two.  The whole place is decorated like a little Japanese bar. It has a large bar the length of the whole place on one side, and you can order straight from there or the tables.  My one criticism is that the chairs are little boxes. It saves space and looks cool, however I'm sure your butt will not thank you for sitting there."}
{"text":"The ramen was so good! It was the best I've had. I also couldn't pass on ramen and a tall boy for $15 I asked for a little spice and our waiter brought out a spice bomb. My husband and I both agreed that it was worth it."}
{"text":"Very good ramen and friendly staff. I had the vegetarian ramen, and I didn't feel I missed anything without meat. Warning - watch out for the bamboo \"sword\" they put in to hold down the dumpling. In dim light you could mistake it for a stray ramen.  Serving times seemed to vary. Our ramen took twenty minutes, while others got theirs within five-to-ten minutes of being seated. They offered us a special with either a PBR \"tall boy\" or a cup of saki plus ramen for $15. But that's probably not a good idea during a work day."}
{"text":"I visit Madison regularly and make sure I get there every time. Hands down the best ramen anywhere. Trust my review and go eat at Morris. Start with the Morris ramen and a chicken bun and go from there."}
{"text":"I can see why people like this place. I had the yam-like sweet potato fries and the veggie ramen. The fries were nice and Crisp and had a yummy sauce. The veggie ramen was mostly good. The noodles were perfect texture and the broth, though slightly saltier than I'd prefer, was flavorful. It came with a veggie pouch thing that had veggies I couldn't Identify chopped up and wrapped in tofu so it would absorb more broth. My friend liked it since it gave the dish a \"Meaty\" component. I cant pin point why I wasn't a huge fan of it. I added an egg, which was like the traditional half egg in ramen which cost $1 extra. Total was a bit pricey. But it is the best ramen I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen. So good you'll pick your bowl up and drink all the soup!!! I've had the pork belly ramen and Spicy ramen-both equally amazing. I liked sitting at the bar better than the weird stools with no backs.   Our service was excellent and it was fun to watch the open kitchen cook"}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch at Morris a couple of different times.  I love the layout of the restaurant.  It is in a narrow space, but they did a nice job with the decorating and the Asian rusticness of the space (if that is even a thing).   I am not a connoisseur of Ramen, so my review should be taken with that in mind.  I have tried two different ramen dishes:  Morris and Miso.  In both cases, I loved the presentation and the broth was very satisfying.  However, there were a couple of complaints that I have.  With the Morris Ramen, they serve it with a hard boiled egg.  I think it is a specialty egg, but I have been told by others that \"real\" ramen should be served with a soft boiled or poached egg so the yolk runs into the broth.  The yolk was hard and, having hoped for the soft boiled yolk, I was a little disappointed.  With the Miso, they had two stars on the menu next to the name.  I took that to mean the spiciness (and that may have been my fault for assuming the star system is similar to what I would have in a Thai restaurant) and it was not spicy.  Again, I thought the broth was tasty but what really disappointed me was the noodles.  They seemed stiff and reminded me of the packages of ramen noodles that we all had in college.  For that price, I would have wanted to taste something that felt homemade and fresh and it did not feel that way to me.  I am not sure I would return as there are other good lunch options around that part of the square that I have enjoyed more."}
{"text":"I LOVED Morris Ramen!   I went here last night with my boyfriend and some friends. It was so fun!   The decor is great. Love the atmosphere and ambiance. You can sit at the counter bar or at a table.   Drinks. Decent selection of wine and beer. The cocktails are STRONG. Don't know if that is a good or bad thing... I ordered two and both were good.  The Food. We got the Bun Flight (one of each of their 4 steamed buns) to share among our table of 4. YUM! Loved the steamed bun. We all had a different favorite - they are all sooooo good! The pork is a classic. Love the pickles with the pork! The beef was my favorite. The flavor was so good. The veggie is a squash thing. It has Indian flavors, and that one was simply delicious, too!   The Ramen. I ordered the Morris Ramen bowl and I can't stop thinking about it - it was amazing! The broth had so much flavor, the meat was perfectly cooked, the noodles were the perfect texture. YUM! Perfect for cold winter nights. They have a lot of add-on options, which is nice. I wasn't a huge fan of paying $1 for a \"spice bomb.\" I get you shouldn't add Sriracha because it would impact the yummy flavor, but I wish I had some other options to add a little more spice to my dish (that didn't cost extra!). The takeout container they give you is perfect, too (although I barely had any left).   The Service. Our server was so nice! She was prompt and made great suggestions. She also told us about the happy hour special they offer. I loved her!   The Price. The Ramen wasn't too expensive. The drinks were. The bill was higher than what I thought it would be, but that was because we had 2 drinks per person.   Overall, I give this 5 stars because I'm already excited to go back! :) It was a great great great bowl of Ramen!"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen in Madison. They pay a great deal of attention to the broth, which is important to someone who grew up eating Vietnamese soups. The noodles are also impressive in texture and thickness. The buns are also quite good. The prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town and the best ramen I've ever had. From the ramen menu I've tried the spicy ramen, morris ramen, and the miso ramen. On my most recent trip, I decided to try the miso ramen (rather than my usual choice of the spicy ramen) and it was better than I remembered. The broth was mild but with a satisfying umami flavor. I added a bit of some spicy red pepper paste referred to by my server as a \"spicy bomb\" to add some heat. The noodles were perfection and the seasonal vegetables were thoughtfully chosen and expertly prepared.   In addition to my ramen I had the squash bun. The squash was seasoned and a bit charged, but in the best way possible. The chutney and yogurt sauce paired perfectly with the pillowy bun. I usually go for the chicken bun, but I enjoyed this one even more.   I can't pay enough wonderful compliments to this restaurant. I'd recommend it to just about anyone."}
{"text":"Morris Ramen serves a bowl of quality noodles. However, it is inconsistent and their seasoning is a little on the salty side. The broth is rich and the noodles are cooked perfectly. I absolutely love their aburaage (tofu skin stuffed with veggies).The biggest problem I have with them is that finishing the bowl could be difficult, mainly due to the saltiness. I often get very thirsty down the bowl. I am a regular of Morris and everytime I go, the ramen would also taste slightly different. Sometimes its on point, sometimes its not. If they could improve on their consistency, Morris Ramen would have 4 stars."}
{"text":"So much goodness here, so many amazing things to compliment the establishment on in general.   1) They use PAPER STRAWS! Yay! If you don't know why this matters, google the plastic straw issue, it's heartbreaking.   2) the ramen here is HANDS DOWN the best in the Madison area, and would stand up to the best in the nation. If you don't believe me, travel the nation and try the ramens and compare them the Morris. It will stand up against the best (even though Morris is the best...).   3) This place is consistent! We've dined here on multiple occasions and each time it's been as good as the last!   4) the service has always been down to earth, accommodating and gone out of their way to educate us when we needed educating.   5) The pork belly. The pork belly. THE PORK BELLY! Wtf?!?? It's the way I'd imagine pork belly is supposed to taste and feel in my sweetest dreams. I'm not playin' with you.   Get here, eat it all.   (As I type this it's literally 82° F outside. It's not a \"soup\" night propelling my raving review.)  PS: DON'T SLEEP ON THOSE EGGS!! Order more!!!"}
{"text":"The last two times that I've been here were during lunch and then a few times before that for dinners with friends. Each time, the ramen has been delicious each and every time. Some of the ramen's broth does get salty in the end so that's just something to keep in mind.  I've usually get either the miso or the spicy ramen. The toppings and broth is slightly different for each of its ramen. For those who prefer something other than ramen, there are a few dishes on the menu that would be perfect for anyone who's not craving some delicious ramen."}
{"text":"Having gotten several recommendations to visit Morris Ramen, I finally bit the bullet this weekend and came here for dinner. And I was not disappointed, not even a little bit. I saw some comparisons to Umami in the reviews, but they're really a horse apiece, in my opinion--price-wise and food-wise. Both are very good.  We started off with a couple drinks and a pork bun. I ordered a Year of the Rabbit, which was very alcoholic and far too astringent for my tastes. Fortunately, my boyfriend is a bitters whore, so we switched and it worked out fine. He ordered a My Second Rodeo, which I drank, and it was really lovely. Just the perfect amount of sweet and tangy.  The pork bun was huge, and had a lot pf pork in it. It was less fatty pork--which is what I expected--and more solid pork. I could have used a few more pickles to balance out all that pork. But the flavor was beautiful, and the bun itself had a really nice fluffy texture. I would love to eat all of my food out of those buns. #twss  I ordered the pork donburi, which came with a good amount of fatty pork, rice, green onion, fried onions and an egg. It was delicious. Everything in the dish combined well to make every mouthful silky and rich. I could have used more green onions, though. And some sort of acidic pickled vegetable garnish to cut the fat a little.   My human got the Morris ramen, which I tried, and it was also delicious. The broth was thick and lovely, and the noodles were perfectly cooked.   I will definitely be back, and I highly recommend Morris Ramen."}
{"text":"Checked out Morris on a Tuesday night just before 6pm. We made it just in time for the rush. There were plenty of seats at the bar but no tables available. I had heard they get really busy and it's a small space, it's where Sushi Red used to be if you're familiar with their old place. I would say for a Tuesday night it was busy and there was a wait for dinner around 630 and the other bar space did fill up.  The space is small and dim, very nice cozy atmosphere. However it was very warm. I think between the small space full of people, boiling water where they cook the noodles, and in addition to eating a hot bowl of ramen all played into that. Service was great and everything was reasonably priced. We got drinks promptly, we also ordered 2 buns, pork and steak, they were amazing. I could've eaten 5 more. My husband and I both ordered the Morris ramen that had the soft boiled egg, pork belly, bamboo shoots, and maybe a one more thing. The broth was pretty good and the pork was cooked perfectly. All together though it was a bit underwhelming, I think we had heard such awesome things we were going in with super high expectations. It was definitely delicious but I just felt like it was missing something and I can't put my finger on it. I would definitely come back for the buns alone and the ramen if the craving hit me."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and fast. The ramen was extremely flavorful and filling! Tried a pork bun for the first time and I will now crave them lol! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves ramen!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we were interested in trying out some ramen off the Capital Square. The restaurant was a bit smaller than I had imagined. We almost past is but some people entered the solid black door in front of us which helped draw us into the restaurant.   Once inside, you will be greeted by a host. There are tables along the wall with interesting boxes used as seating. There is also seating along the bar. If you're at the bar, you will be able to watch them make the food.   I ordered the Spicy Ramen and some Kim chee. The Chashu chicken was very interesting visually having never had it before. It was like chicken that was rolled up and then cut into smaller rolls. The dish comes with one of these chicken rolls along with some nom chit and seaweed. Overall, very taste with good flavor. The Kim chee was pretty good too though not the best I have tasted.   Service was great. Our server was very helpful with assisting us in choosing our dishes.   I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Really small ramen menu and descriptions are almost a little frustratingly vague, but the one I had (Spicy Ramen) was very good. I appreciated that they had a chicken-based one. While the broth was a little one note, the chicken chashu was nice and tender and the noodles were on point. I added a soft-boiled egg, which was also a winner.  Steamed buns (the folded kind) looked good. My party ordered the squash and pork ones and said they were good though I didn't try any.  I also wanted to love their beer menu, seeing as they had \"3 Floyds Rotating\" and \"Surly Rotating\" on their menu, as I'm not from the area so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try some local big-name brews. But I came on the wrong day for that as their current selections were a 3 Floyds Helles Lager (of all the great IPAs/DIPAs and even pales that they have, they put on a Helles Lager?) the Surly Bender Brown, which I guess is one of their standards but I wish it would have been Furious or another IPA.   I won't take off for the beer they didn't have (since to be fair, the menu did state it was \"rotating\") so the four stars is squarely for their ramen. But I hope their tap selection will be more interesting for my next visit."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in town. One of those hole-in-the-wall kind of places you stumble into on a weekday when you're hungry and no other place you know is open. Got the squash and the chicken buns and was very satisfied with them. Also tried the brussel sprouts and my only complaint is that it was too small a portion for such good food."}
{"text":"Some of the absolute best and authentic ramen we have had since returning from Japan (and we have tried as many as we could find). If you are missing some of thw flavors from overseas, come here. And if you have never been to Japan, come here anyway for some GREAT food. Staff are extreamly polite and the atmosphere is so relaxed. Will definatly be back next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is great! I knew from the door at the enterance that I was going to love it. I took my dad here for his bday dinner and we were not disappointed. I had the Morris Ramen with a Spice Bomb added \"recommended\" and my dad had the Spicy Ramen. Both were delicious. Great pork belly and soft boiled egg in the Morris and tasty marinated chicken in the Spicy. We also each got a Pork Bun, which I would order 2 for myself next time as I just wanted to keep eating them. Drinks are also good. Total bill was reasonable for what you get, 2 giant bowls of ramen with a ton of toppings, 2 pork buns, and two signature cocktails for $55, not bad!"}
{"text":"Okie Dokie, I'm from Hawaii where Ramen shops are readily available.  Like taco shops in SoCal and Fried Curds in Wisconsin.....even the McD's sell a version named Saimin which is a warm tummy full of hot noodles on those cool nights.  I was surprised when my Beloit family suggested we drive to Madison for cocktails and Ramen.  Woo hoo game on!  The ambiance is trendy, friendly and small with comfortable seating and fast, friendly service.  My Yelpy foodie sister Kris suggested the buns, quite good.  The squash bun was different from what I've had prior but quite tasty, the pork was my fav of the two.  We ordered edamame which was crisp without too much salt as some places do.  We ordered our Ramen choices, I'm always looking for spicy and Morris' hit the spot.  Broth was solid, noodles were firm and done to perfection.  No oil floating and a fantastic amount of veggies.  I'm glad my family had been before because I ordered first.  As Rae ordered I was interjecting my \"oh can I have that added to mine too?\" comments so I got much in my bowl I would have otherwise missed.  All done it was a great experience and I would go back any time.  Parking was across the street in the municipal lot and conveniently located.  It was a ways to drive for a bowl of noodle soup but not too far for this particular Ramen experience.  I'll be back....said in my best Arnold voice!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here so I asked the waitress for her recommendation and she said the veggie miso. It was good but she described it as having a very hearty, flavorful broth. Although it was tasty, I didn't feel like it had very much flavor overall. My friend ordered the Morris ramen and it was amazing. The pork belly melted in your mouth and was incredible. If I had ordered the Morris, I probably would have given 5 stars. The service was great and the ramen was very good. I just wouldn't order the veggie miso next time. Also, I would love to try the buns because someone at our table was eating them and it looked amazing."}
