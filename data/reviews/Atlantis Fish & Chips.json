{"text":"Fantastic! Moved into a nearby neighborhood recently and so glad I found this place. Clean, friendly service, quality, eat-in or take-out family run fish & chip shop. The fish batter is perfect, fish is fresh and the chips are great. Looking forward to my next visit! Go here now...stop looking for somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips mmmm a little pricey but worth every dime! If your looking for nice light batter and melt in your mouth flaky fish this is the place."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The halibut is exceptionally fresh tasting and the other seafood fare is just as good. I'm talking monger quality.  The owners are friendly and the service is good.   Prices are decent and the lunch menu is good value for the money.  I've been here multiple times and have never been let down."}
{"text":"Was in about a month ago and was told by the waitress we usually get, that new owners take over the joint on the following Monday (this was on a Friday). Uh-oh I thought...changes they be a coming.......
Dropped in today. Our waitress wasn't working (and this is normally her shift)....so.....some staff may have changed. Had the food?
Yup
The fish was excellent......cooked perfectly....great flavour. Where my meal fell flat were the fries. They've obviously changed the way they're made (actually...the new ones tasted and looked like McCains frozen chips, whereas before they were big, home cut style). Huge disappointment as the fries take up half the plate.
Perhaps it's the new owners trying different things.....but messing with a sure thing could be dangerous with the \"regulars\"."}
