{"text":"My new go-to lunch spot because they're close to work and they deliver. Small subs are still big enough to be the right about of full. Great selection for vegetarians. Don't know if they make the garden burger in house, but it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I just dropped off my dry-cleaning at Kim's in Elizabeth and stumbled upon Sandwich Max. I Immediately looked on Yelp and saw soooo many 5 star reviews I had to give it a try. Needless to say, I LOVED my sandwich. The people behind the counter were super friendly and gave me the low-down of how to \"build\" my turkey and cheese sandwich--lots of cheese options and veggies galore. Even the sub roll was impressive! I was offered a chance to have it cold or pressed on a panini machine. So glad I went the panini route and love that all the veggies were added AFTER the turkey and cheese were heated. The turkey was very high quality and the cheese was guey and yummy. The roll was crispy and the veggies were very fresh. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte my entire life and have tried many different shops throughout town.  My opinion this is certainly one of the best sandwich shops around if not the best."}
{"text":"Really great Reuben. When pulling up, my wife said the best places are holes in the wall and it is both."}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch or whenever the mood strikes. Sandwiches are awesome and they really give you your moneys worth. Also they offer bike benefits discount which is great if youre riding in the area. Oh and theres some pretty cool artwork on the walls!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sub shop! Love the ham and salami! I think I've eaten here at least 5 times in the last week when I'm in my office. The staff are super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"The service is always great! Super nice people and they are quick. I was excited to try the philly based on another review. It was good enough. I don't think they have a grill and cook it fresh though. It was made way too fast, who knew that was possible :) They only offer peppers and mushrooms, so I added raw onion. The bread is great. The meat wasn't bad. I think it was just premade and heated up. The cashier told me the mushrooms are from a can. I didn't try them. I love the Italian and will stick with that. The turkey on wheat is also good."}
{"text":"I have to give kudos for their flawless, no worry catering. I needed boxed lunches for 25-30 people and they gave a great assortment of delicious sandwiches and salads. But beyond that, they thought of everything. All lunches came with chips and a cookie. Beverages came in gallons of iced tea and lemonade with cups AND bags of ice. When you're running a meeting and don't have time to worry about the catering they really put the 'no worry' in it. It was all delivered correctly and right on time."}
{"text":"I love Sandwich Max.  Have been eating here for years and am always impressed with the fresh ingredients. Nothing has ever been soggy or soft - always crispy, crunchy with beautiful color.  I usually get the chicken breast salad and add on as many extras as I like like bell peppers, cucumbers, pickles, black olives, and then I get a choice of lettuce and tomatoes, onions, etc  They make their own Ranch dressing and it's great.  They have great tuna salad too. Homemade and chunky with boiled eggs.  Can't go wrong.  Their daily special sandwiches give you a break on the sandwich, chips, and a drink.  It's a true neighborhood spot and it's always great to run into people I know.   Lots of business lunch goers and folks from the nearby hospitals.  Ignore the negative reviews if you are looking for fresh ingredients.  If you're new to the neighborhood, this could become one of your favorites."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, fresh ingredients, quick and friendly service.  A great option if you want to try a place outside the reg chair restaurants.  Only con the parking is a pain."}
{"text":"My kids absolutely adore this place! They love getting to pick their own chips and drink, and nothing beats the spinny stools and bar across the window in the front. Service could be faster and a bit more friendly, but nothing beats the old time sandwich yumminess if you're in the Elizabeth area."}
{"text":"THE best sub in Charlotte, hands down!  I am presently devouring my Italian with unbridled joy.  It is THAT good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich spot in Charlotte!  They use high quality ingredients, have generous portions and they DELIVER!  If you want an authentic deli sandwich, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop in Charlotte!!  I love all the toppings you can get on the sub and they portion the sub perfectly!  My favorite is the turkey and cheese sub!"}
{"text":"The last time I had to stop at the Dollar General, I noticed Sandwich Max as I drove by on my way out.  After reading a few of the very glowing reviews on this website, I decided to stop in and get one of my favorites - a Reuben.  The corned beef was moist and delicious and the kraut was tasty and not overwhelming.  The counter help was friendly and efficient.  I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes.  I look forward to future trips as a number of subs sounded quite tempting.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to any sandwich-loving individuals.  It's well worth a trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops in Charlotte.  I'm obsessed with the Italian, and the Pressed TCB is a close second.  I love the fact that it's locally owned, and although sometimes it takes a while to get your order (delivery and in store), it never disappoints."}
{"text":"It's good and I'll be back but it wasn't super memorable. I didn't walk away plotting my return. It is fine but I wouldn't tell someone. Hey sandwich max make sure you check that place out. Closer to 3.5 but definitely not a 4star joint imo."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today, my food was delicious and the staff is great! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Order online and it's ready to pick-up in 10-15... no lines.  Fresh and always made to perfection.  Try the Ogre (sp?) sauce!"}
{"text":"If your craving for a delicious sandwich lunch has yet to be satisfied then make Sandwich Max your next visit! I tried the TCB --Turkey Cordon Bleau--swiss, turkey, bacon & mayo-- after reading the yelp reviews. This sandwich combines my love of bacon and turkey, with a hot pressed finish of crunchy wheat bread that was sublime. You can add on tomato, peppers, lettuce, pickles, etc. I literally devoured the whole thing!  I cannot wait to try more of their sandwiches. They deliver in the neighborhood also which is awesome!"}
{"text":"I called up to see if this place Sandwich Max was a chain and they said no.  So I went in to try it.  I will tell you I have been in the deli/supermarket business 30years and know what a good sub is.  I have had too many to even think twice that this was the worst sub EVER!  I dont mean to be critical but there was no meat on my italian hero, but a pound of lettuce and tomato.  Same owners I believe as sub station so he can do what he wants.  Dont waste your money like I did!  Absolutely terrible sandwich, no wonder why there were 5 people eating at lunchtime."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop did not disappoint. Great service and the sub sandwich surpassed my expectations. I will skip over Subway any day for their sub. I loved that they cut the meat fresh and the toppings were fresh. The finished product was wrapped in old style butcher paper that gave it a unique charm. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different. Ordered online for pickup. We leave in West Charlotte, so it was just a short drive to their spot in Uptown.  We got the Pressed TCB and the Cheesesteak, both as footlongs.  Wife said the TCB was a bit salty but \"what should I have expected with fresh ham and bacon.\"   The Cheesesteak was delicious. Fresh mushrooms and peppers."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's a great sandwich, but only go when you have some time on your hands. I love that it has a mom and pop feel. I think normally I would have given it a 5 star, but again, service is a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"I'd classify this place as solid.  If you want a sandwich quick, and aren't close to rhino market,  then I can't I identify any reason not to go here.  It's your standard good sandwich shop. You've probably had something like this from a sandwich shop in your respective hometown.  And, this familiarity will likely be comforting."}
{"text":"Started going here recently and have since become a fan.  They're a local \"Jersey Mike's\" if you will.  They cut the meats and cheeses fresh to order, which makes a world of difference in my opinion.  I actually haven't gotten anything other than the Italian, but I think that's one of their signature sandwiches anyway.  They have a daily sandwich special that essentially gets you a free drink, but I usually stick to water at all times (other than beer/wine of course).  I'm out the door with a fresh 6\" at a little over $5, piled high and much better quality than your typical chains."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. if you want a fresh sandwich the way you like it, go here. It's a hole in the wall, but it's so good. You can't go wrong. They even have gluten free options and salad. Don't settle for Jersey mikes next door. The prices are almost the same, sometimes less for better quality."}
{"text":"This place changed my mind on deli sandwiches. Thanks guys I would have never known what a real deli sandwich was ! Awesome staff, great ingredients and super clean. Touché sandwich max touché"}
{"text":"It seems like when I need to grab something quick I'm always around 7th street, perfect because I love Sandwich Max's Italian sub.  Fresh bread and the toppings, bread and meat ratio are equal.  I really like that they make each sandwich like they are making it for themselves, it's not just slapped together.    Also, big plus good sweet tea."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty good but today they just totally left the mayo off of my sandwich and I love mayo but that's the risk u Take when u order to go over the phone."}
{"text":"This place was totally worth the trip from the University City area. I am from NJ and love a good sub, which I have not been able to find here. The chain sub shops are simply not adequate.  I will say that I definitely will come back here for a sub. One of the main things that can make or break a sub is the bread. Their bread reminds me of Wawa bread. **Gosh, I miss Wawa.** Anyway, the bread is soft and has great texture. Think of potato bread, but not.  Everything tasted fresh. I had a vegetarian and I also ordered an Italian sub for my son. I would drive pass 100 Subways and 1,000 Jimmy Johns to get a sub from Sandwich Max."}
{"text":"I didn't think this was really that great.  It tasted pretty much like Jersey Mikes to me.  It's basic, but not really out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside, but this is the absolute best sandwich shop in Charlotte. I go here about once a week and haven't been disappointed yet. I love how fresh the ingredients are - freshly shaved meats/cheeses and freshly cut veggies. You can really taste the difference. They're also really great about customizing exactly what you want on your sandwich."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite sandwich spots.  I have been three times now and all were good experiences.  Anything with capicola is delicious.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a great local sub shop. Instead of taking your money to Jersey Mikes, go across Pecan to Sandwich Max and you'll get a delicious local sub with freshly sliced meats and cheese, crunchy lettuce, and perfect hoagie rolls. The staff is really friendly and will accommodate any request you have. They've got hot sandwiches and subs which are amazing, but the mark of a good sandwich place is whether they can pull of a cold deli sub - and Sandwich Max nails it. Great value too - the footlong size is a huge amount of food. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our sandwiches!  Lots of choices.  Daily specials get a free drink - always a bonus."}
{"text":"Had the turkey, ham, & cheese for lunch and it was GREAT. Love to see a good sub place in Plaza Midwood/Elizabeth that's VERY reasonably priced. We ordered 16 subs for our entire office for lunch, and not a single one of them was screwed up. That's a HUGE win. We do that every week, and most of the time someone's is messed up or missing, or wrong. These guys have the right attention to detail and we're definitely going to visit again."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches!! The simplicity of the choices are really nice. Quality ingredients and very good prices. I'm definitely a Jersey Mikes fan, this is a new rival!! Not always the fastest made while you wait, but they take phone orders pretty easily so that makes it perfect. Some cool hipster art on the walls, but again, it's simple and they let the food be the most important thing in the room. Plenty of seating and usually had English Soccer on! Excellent!! I loved the TCB not pressed."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a sandwich and didn't feel like Jersey Mikes so I figured this place looked as good as any.  I made sure I was in an appropriate spot and headed inside.    The menu board is very large and easy to read.  Even though I was in the mood for a turkey panini I set my eyes on the Reuben and it really hit the spot.  The decor is very sparse right now, but the sandwich was great and I liked the option of mustard instead of 1000 island on my reuben."}
{"text":"I say YES to Sandwich Max.. They're so close to my job and I love it. They're also conveniently located to Kim's Cleaners where I take some of my things to get cleaned.   So I've been like twice, because I usually bring my lunch. But if I want something healthy, I love coming here.  Why? They have wraps... They have hummus... They are really friendly and accommodating.   Are you tired of Subway? Want something healthy without all the carbs (bread)? Friendly service from people who actually enjoy crafting sandwiches and wraps instead of getting a pimply faced kid or a someone who doesn't even greet you when you walk in? Well...  Come here. No really.... Go!"}
{"text":"ordered lunch online, got estimate that it would be here in about 45 mins, but it arrived in like 25. everything was delicious and very reasonably priced. will definitely be a new go-to for lunches when I am too busy (or too lazy) to leave the office."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for lunch for delivery and was really impressed! It was here in 30 minutes or less, was fresh, and the tea was still cold (and not too sweet). I got the turkey sandwich and they are very generous with their servings. I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"O my dear sweet Lord that was a good sub. Had the large \"Max'd Out\" sub and it was delicious! Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The guys who run this joint are super friendly, very casual. About as local as it gets to the community. My sandwiches are always super fresh, really delicious, and maybe $1 more than Subway where the ingredients are hard to pronounce and for the most part, artificial. Very laid-back, and the daily specials with chips/drink is about $9 for a small (which is equivalent to a Subway footlong).  I'm here multiple times a week since I'm in Midtown for work and it's great, especially if you need a below-$10 lunch option in the expensive Elizabeth/Dilworth area. I'm a regular customer and I'll definitely keep coming back. About the only \"negative\" is all the construction that's going on in that area, but that isn't on the owner or the restaurant...plus it's starting to look nice.  Definitely hope they stick around."}
{"text":"I love this place; the subs are wonderful - fresh, made with love! The meats are fresh, not scary looking like at some places. I love the shredded lettuce, the thin sliced tomatoes - fresh breads too! and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Love this place. They take pride in the food they serve. Everyone is always friendly and helpful. They also have party size subs. Used them several times and always a big hit."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a local deli / sandwich shop in town & this place is a good one. I recommend the large club."}
{"text":"I ordered online and it was easy, efficient and when I arrived the order was ready!!  The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean and tidy.  I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and it was very tasty and reminded me of my mom's chicken salad. It is very convenient to my work and home.  I plan to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Old Sub Station turned into awesomeness! 1st time and will be back. Simple decor, great menu. Just a good ol fashioned hogie shop."}
{"text":"Sandwich Max provides some darn tasty sandwiches. The TCB is my personal favorite, though I prefer it on a wheat roll over the traditional bread option. Online ordering through Yelp is a great option, too. They offer a check-in for 10% currently which is a bonus.  The decor was not updated much from when it was Sub Station II, but it is enjoyable enough if you want to dine in. The staff is generally very friendly and welcoming. There are daily specials that include a free drink.   The parking can be a bit of a pain, but the price is fair for the quality of food you get (i.e. fresh sliced deli meats and cheeses cut for that sandwich)."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  Wouldn't go anywhere else but lately (past year or so) the bread has been sub-par when compared to it's neighbor JM's.  I'd love to support a \"local\" business but I no longer am a patron.  Hope this changes!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  My favorite is the presses TCB.  You can't lose there!  Fast and correct!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Turkey, Ham and Roast Beef is delicious. The ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sandwich places I've ever been to! Me & my boyfriend always get subs from here & the employees there are always nice!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in Charlotte. My go to is the Italian a truly delicious sammich.   Can order online or call in and it's ready when you get there and they also deliver if you are close to the shop.  Locally owned. Go give it a try you will not be let down."}
{"text":"From the outside, you might assume this place isn't great (it's in a strip mall next to a dry cleaner and fitness studio). However, you would be sorely mistaken. Comparing this place to Jersey Mike's (across the street) would be like comparing a Dae Woo to a Maserati. Not a car buff? Okay, how about krystal burger vs five guys? Not a metaphor person? FINE, it's like comparing a poorly assembled piece of trash to a pristine example of the finest craftsmanship. Folks, the sandwiches are great and I am a sandwich person (figuratively, of course). Don't like sandwiches? YOU AREN'T AMERICAN OR HUMAN. Do like sandwiches? EAT HERE! Other factors:  Ambiance? Cool indie skateboard art, crackle barrel chairs, and tiny TVs. B+ Service? Always friendly and fast. A+ Ingredients? Fresh, but alfalfa sprouts and a better chip selection would be much appreciated! (Artisan brands like Boulder Canyon and Zapps) A-  I cannot vouch for their salads because I am a blue-blooded man and do not eat such things when given the alternative of sandwich."}
{"text":"Let me first say that my Reuben was great. A good portion of corned beef and not over powering with the sauerkraut. Everything else about the experience was sub-par.  I arrived, was the only customer inside, and there were no employees at the counter. I waited for a minute and someone finally came out and took my order. Like I said, a Reuben to go, nothing crazy. Immediately after I ordered, a dad and his two sons came in and ordered. I waited about five minutes, and somehow their THREE sandwiches came out before my one. Also while waiting I noticed that the floor was pretty nasty. Discarded Cheetos and shredded lettuce were littered under almost every table. Maybe they had a lunch rush and had not had time to clean up, or maybe they only sweep once a week, who knows?  I continued to wait and overheard the two employees discussing how happy they were that they were only open another three hours. I mean, I'm no fan of working on Sundays, but keep it at a lower volume so customers can not hear it.  I was pleased with the sandwich, but overall pretty disappointed in the experience."}
{"text":"My Husband and I came here for the first time today.  We got 3 Reubens an Italian and a meatball for our group.  It was Delicious,  everyone loved it!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being a ex New Yorker sandwiches are important. They do a really nice job here. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Their tuna is awesome, not too mayonnaise-y. I also like their salami/pepperoni/cheese. Great options for bread and cheese."}
{"text":"Worst sub place ever! Don't waste your time coming here- go to any other sub shop. Horrible service, Horrible food, FOUND HAIR IN MY SANDWICH!!!!"}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches! I've had the Reuben and the turkey, ham, and cheese. Both were great. This place reminds me of Port of Subs back home. That mayo:mustard is key! Thank you for reigniting my love for deli sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is my second time using Sandwich Max, the first time having a few issues. This time there were no issues. They arrived 15 min early, the delivery man was very nice. My only complaint, which I did not notice the first time is that there are two different sites that allow online ordering for this place and both have the same phone number and address. One allows delivery to my work and the other does not. Both ordering forms are different too, one not having as many options as the other. Not sure if they realize this. But I will continue to use them and try different sandwiches!"}
{"text":"So once again, I went to a place based on really good reviews, and once again, i was disappointed.   Went to Sandwich Max on a Saturday at 2pm. There was three people working. There were maybe 3 other people eating sandwiches already and we were the only people in line. I mention this because it was relatively slow and the place was really dirty. My boyfriend and I decided to eat in and every table was dirty (crumbs, pieces of toppings from sandwiches like stray pieces of lettuce, water stains from cups, etc) and the floor was pretty unclean too. Oh well, maybe we had just missed the lunch rush? Anyway, for the food, I ordered a cheesesteak with peppers and mushrooms; my boyfriend got capicola, ham and cheese. The cheesesteak, was flat out horrible! If you've ever been to jersey mikes and get a cheesesteak, you can see them cooking the meat on the flattop. When I got the sandwich, it was clear that they have meat already chopped and cooked sitting in a cooler somewhere and they just microwave it. How do I know, the peppers and mushrooms were cold and the sandwich itself was dripping in water/juice whenever you picked it up. It was not right - That gets 1 star. The cold cut sandwich my boyfriend got, the meat was good, but the bread was old and the toppings skimpy.  I get that this is a local place and probably has a lot of local support, but I'm really sick of local places resting on their 'local laurels' and then producing subpar product. It's like my boyfriend commented when we were trying to figure out why this got such high reviews 'It's like the sandwiches are made by people who hate their lives and eaten by people who hate their lives.' Maybe this is harsh, but I'm sick of paying money for food that isn't good. Sorry sandwich max, I don't mean to vent on you, but what I just experienced was not a 4.5 experience."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Found it by luck when a place I had intended on getting lunch from was not open. They have a pretty big selection which entails how and what you want your sandwich on so be prepared to make some decisions. Or read over the menu so you are best prepared. Very fresh and generous in their portions. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great subs and actually costs less than the franchise places. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop in Elizabeth. Specializes in subs. Very clean, brightly decorated shop. Sandwiches are inexpensive and delicious."}
{"text":"Hummus Wrap? I'm in! Friendly counter service, good wrap"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome subs and salads. The sub rolls are shipped in from NY. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"A great little sandwich shop with charm.    The decor is local art work and other unique items.  Could be a little more \"finished\" with the decorating, seemed a bit sparse.  We enjoyed our sandwiches, but they were missing something we couldn't put out finger on.  We did Love the shredded lettuce, the way they shred it makes it really fresh and crisp.  I wish I could better describe what was missing, the sandwiches just seemed a little bland.  I teetered between 3 and 4 stars, because we did enjoy our visit, but went with three because of the semi-sparse decor, and the mystery blandness."}
{"text":"My daughter loved their basic sandwich, she said their bread was delicious. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Get the Italian and have it heated.  It's amazing!!!!   Great little place with good prices.  Definitely going to add this into my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Very good deli sandwiches!!! They have hot subs as well. I had the turkey and cheese and they have a good amount of toppings to choose from. They are free! I had the sweet wheat and it was pretty tasty. I wish I got a 12 inch just to eat more. This will be my go to sandwich shop."}
{"text":"This place has been around for awhile (it used to be called Sub Station II) in a competitive market (there's a Jersey Mike's right across Pecan and a Subway not far away) which is a testament to its quality.  I've always enjoyed eating here and the staff are usually excellent. The ingredients are fresh and the tea is always refreshing. Max has built a good business and something Elizabeth can take pride in."}
{"text":"Great sandwich stop in Charlotte but the employees can be hipster snobby...I thanked them for my sandwich orders and employee rolled his eyes at me...love the sandwiches but could do without the attitude!"}
{"text":"Not a franchise, Sandwich Max is all about the sandwiches and the salads. Simple enough, order at the register and your sandwich is called out. In the meanwhile, a coke fountain and urns of tea. I made myself a nice Arnold Palmer while I waited.  I opted for today's special, a combination of ham and salami and cheese, going with the usual vegetables plus spicy mustard and cucumbers. Tip: Light lettuce is a good idea.  Sandwich was excellent. Loaded well with meat and vegetables, cut into quarters. Easy eating and inexpensive. I'll be back to Sandwich Max!  Oh, and they have free wifi."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Sandwich Max and I will definitely be back. My sandwich was delicious (I got the Pressed TCB on Sourdough)! The service is great, friendly and quick even though everything is made to order. I work in Uptown and we were able to eat our lunches and get back to work in an hour. Portions are great too. Someone I was with ordered a large sub and they had to take part of it home. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at my fair share of sandwich places, and am typically a JMikes kind of girl.  However, after eating at this place several times over the past few months, they are by far my new fave!!  So first off, the value that you get for your money here just blows me away.  Basically, you're paying the same prices as Subway but getting a MUCH MUUUUUCH better gourmet legit sandwich.  I love that they're super accommodating, and will customize any sandwich for you, toast it, do different bread--- whatever you want!  My favorite is the pressed TCB (with the original toppings + black olives), but the Reuben, the ham/cappicola/chz, and the Italian are all awesome too.    During the course of us eating here, I've actually gotten pregnant, and I LOVE the fact that they toast my sandwiches up to the proper temp so I can still eat them :).  That's a big deal when you're having serious sandwich cravings that most places can't accommodate lol.  They have this special toaster thing that makes them all melty and yummy without being soggy.  Definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had never heard about this place until I found it on Yelp. I got a cheesesteak sandwich. It was better than average and they had pretty good customer service"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in Charlotte hands down! The art on the walls is bad a$$ and the people there so so darn friendly. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  I was in town on business, found it on Yelp and dragged my colleagues there. The owner is a great guy, the sandwich is a very good value and it's not surprising this place is so popular! The Italian is a good choice. Per a Yelper's recommendation, I added the banana peppers. Good choice! Everyone else in my group was very happy too!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and I got delivery from them today they totally messed up my order they gave me macaroni salad instead of a potato salad my sandwich was on toasted bread which it should've been on a hoagie roll and totally ignored my special requests will not order from them again"}
{"text":"In search of the best Italian hoagie in Charlotte.  Sand which Mac did not disappoint!  One of my new favorite Sub shops.  The meatball is pretty fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but on my first visit I'm not a fan.  It wasn't very busy, but it seemed they were in the weeds.  The guy taking my order was hard to understand because he was a mumbler.  I caught about every third word.  I ordered the Reuben with thousand island dressing, but I never could understand what he was saying - it may have been options for the meat.  I think I got corned beef, which wasn't very flavorful.  I felt bad for the guy making the sandwiches, cause he kept asking the other guy to help him out.  Maybe I was there on an off day."}
{"text":"I have been getting cold subs here for years.   The sandwiches are consistently good and the people behind the counter are nice.  Prices are reasonable.  Only downside is the lousy parking lot."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into this sandwich shop Monday afternoon for lunch. I ordered their daily special (salami) on wheat with a variety of toppings. All the veggies were fresh and I loved the thinly shredded lettuce. They even brought out our food for us since they saw I was busy dealing with our baby. I definitely will visit again when I'm craving a fresh and delicious deli sub."}
{"text":"I'm a Charlotte native. I lived in Elizabeth for 5 years, moved to Dilworth for 1 year, then moved back to Elizabeth last month. I'm kicking myself for only trying Sandwich Max two weeks ago since I can walk there now. BEST. SUBS. EVER.  I love a good sandwich. If you were to look at my twin sister and I's text message thread, you would find a ridiculous amount of texts about sandwiches since we know not to go buy one without asking if the other wants one. Turkey and cheese subs are life. I normally take pictures of what I order to link to my reviews, but both times I've eaten there, I couldn't wait to take the picture and dove right in.  I love the turkey sub on white bread with provolone cheese. I get \"the standard\" toppings, minus salt and onions and I added pickles. The large sub is cut into quarters and I was sad when it was gone. I tried the potato salad with it and it doesn't disappoint, but nothing could be better than that sub.  All of the construction around it is a pain and I was worried I was walking into a seedy place because of how the entrance currently looks, but the restaurant itself was homey. I drove there on the way home tonight, but I will definitely walk from now on because the parking lot isn't the easiest to get in and out of, especially with all those scary signs everywhere.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at Sandwich Max to continue my reuben journey around Charlotte. It was a great bang for the buck - but the reubens (you get 2 for the $9.50 price - not sure why it's served that way) themselves were fairly mediocre.   The reuben was basically a corned beef sandwich - 90% of the sandwich was corned beef. Sadly the corned beef was a little below average. There was very little kraut and the cheese and russian were also barely noticeable. If you're just looking to get a mediocre corned beef sandwich for a good price you'll be content, but if you're looking for that full on reuben experience you should look elsewhere. I likely would have given Sandwich Max a 2/5 just due to the reuben, but I do love a good deal."}
{"text":"Is it Subway? No, but that is a good thing - for the most part.  The bad is that with Subway, you mostly know what you are getting, and if you do not, you can fairly easily read the menu board and determine what you want. At the Max (are we at Bayside? Where is Screech? Zack?), you can of course order what you want, but as an independent, their menu boards could use a bit of help. Knowing what to order can be a challenge, and while you can customize like crazy, it's not immediate knowing just how you can do so. Something in this area could help the process.  The good is that just about anything you order will likely be awfully tasty, so order away and run with it. The process ultimately is not that different than any other sub shop - choose your sandwich, choose your protein and bread, then tell them what you want on it. The only other downside is if you want it heated (grilled, etc) you will have to wait a minute, but it's worth it.  And don't forget the Ogre sauce."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy sandwiches when I make them for myself. Why, oh why, does it taste better when someone else crafts a sammie for you?  I was looking for something quick to grab so I could watch the Nebraska game from my couch. This place is just minutes down the road, so I popped in this past Saturday.  Scanning all the sandwiches, I (as usual) couldn't figure out what I wanted. The guys behind the counter immediately jumped in to help. Really nice. They said their best sellers are the Italian (on the cold side) and the pressed turkey cordon bleu (on the hot side). Score, I already had my eye on the Italian. I got a small with chips and a drink for $8.55.   The Italian was loaded with meat. The toppings were fresh. Solid little place to get a sandwich. I'll be back to try that TCB.   Also, they have Cherry Coke. I don't drink a lot of soda, but when I see CC on the fountain... you can bet I'm ordering one."}
{"text":"Hopefully just a off day last week. I ordered a roast beef sandwich and it was extremely tough. Still going to continue eating here just hope the quality control steps up a bit"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, I'm so glad I finally tried this place! So far I've only had stuff from the cold side- delicious and a ton of food- but thanks to the guy sitting near me the Reuben is calling my name for next time."}
{"text":"Good food, love that it's locally owned.  Employees are very friendly.  Everyday of the week there's a special."}
{"text":"I was gonna give this place 3 and 1/2 stars, but you can't do that on Yelp so I rounded to 4. I enjoy going to sub places a lot and I will probably end up coming back to Sandwich Max, but the sandwich itself was kind of underwhelming. It was however a large amount of food (a 12 inch sub, chips, and drink for $10) for a pretty low price. The atmosphere was kind of dull but that didn't affect my experience at all. While the sandwich was very large, it was kind of plain and flavorless. Go to Sandwich Max if you want a good amount of food for a low price."}
{"text":"Always pleasant staff.  Very helpful and knowledgable.  Sandwiches are delicious!  Except the meatball which isn't so great.  Just get a deli sandwich of some kind and you'll be happy. I would go back and have went back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best deli sandwich in Charlotte. Super fresh. Super good. Super delicious. The lettuce on the sandwich qualifies as a vegetable, and it's beautifully seasoned with \"the standard\" ingredients. This \"standard\" seasoning is what makes this sandwich amazing. Friendly staff. Highly recommend it. Busy at lunch but worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a tasty, slightly hidden gem in the heart of Elizabeth! It's very reminiscent of Jersey Mikes, where the meat is sliced fresh, there's thin shards of lettuce and everything is piled high. Sandwiches like these are things you dream about! Then there's the added bonus of a kosher dill slice. This sandwich was something I want to come back for again and again.   Every day they have a different sandwich special, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!   You can eat in or take out, and there is sidewalk patio seating for those spring nights!"}
{"text":"Liked the sandwich. I had tried a veggie wrap, and it was so tasty and pretty big sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a really good sandwich shop. I got the Reuben and it was great. Not being from Charlotte I only get to try a few places a year. This will be one I will come back too."}
{"text":"Great variety of sandwiches and subs.   Very fresh and delicious.   Prices reasonable and great selection.   Short wait."}
{"text":"So glad I finally checked this place out. It's in the same shopping center as the place I work out at and I had been meaning to try it! I decided to grab a sub before heading out to the pool and ordered the Turkey and provolone on wheat bread.  I asked for them not to make it with the oregano since I've never liked that spice anyway. It was the perfect meal for a day in the hot sun at the pool. Light but filling. The meat and cheese was very fresh!  If you're looking to support local...this is the place! I also learned that they deliver without requiring you to spend a minimum and there is NO delivery charge...say whaaaaa? I'm not sure how long that will last so you may want to try their delivery while it's free! Be sure to check in because I believe there is a promo code. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit!  I ordered something quick and light prior to heading over next door to Burn Bootcamp. The side of tuna was delicious and a nice size portion.   The menu had some other great options so I look forward to coming back and giving one of their hot sandwiches a try!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Comparable to the chain across the street, but better and cheaper. The deliver is always fast. I go with the max'd out sandwich most of the time, with thinly shredded lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar, and mayo. So much yes! If you want a good, fresh sandwich come here. The meat isn't sliced til you order!"}
{"text":"First time trying...And last time!!! My sandwich was horrible,I got a HOT sandwich...But it was COLD.No flavor at all.The guy who helped me was nice."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are one of my top food groups so I'm always on the lookout for the next good one. Thankfully, so is the Weekly Yelp so when they featured sandwiches in CLT a few weeks ago, I started bookmarking.   Distance from home is never a deterrent when it comes to a top food group so a weekend trip brought me here and it was fab. Fresh. Read, quality meats and cheeses all served quick and friendly. Count me in for a return trip!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem! To preface my review, I could eat sandwiches for every meal of the day. I have worked in sandwich shops, I make my own sandwiches, I eat lots of sandwiches, and I have yet to come across a better sandwich than Sandwich Max. If I find something I like, I usually don't stray from that particular order, and all 4 or 5 times I have ordered from Sandwich Max, I have gone with the Maxed Out, which is a variety of meats sliced to order on a fluffy bun, properly dressed and garnished with lettuce, onions, oil and vinegar and oregano. No fluff, no frills, the lettuce is shredded paper thin and wonderfully crispy, I can find absolutely zero faults with anything about the product. In addition, every time I walk in the door, I am greeted with a genuine hello, the staff has always been super friendly, if I had to wait, I was offered a cup for a soda, free of charge. I consider myself a full-blown sandwich aficionado, and anyone in Charlotte who has not tried this place should. My wife is from Pennsylvania and the Sandwich Max subs reminded her of northern Hoagie shops she used to go to as a kid. Lastly - The potato salad is off the charts. I will be back often, thank you, Sandwich Max!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Sandwiches. Ever. Seriously, I love this place. My boyfriend loves the TCB and I always make my own creation. The staff is awesome too, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"After seeing high reviews here on Yelp I decided to try it. The food was good and reasonable priced. I am a big sucker for good customer service and I received just that! An older gentleman assisted me and he was very very friendly. He took my order and being it was my first time took his time and answered all of my questions. If you want a really good sandwich unlike Subway this spot you should try. Even if the food was bad which it wasn't I would still go back just because of the service! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love the service, food and tea!!  Very fresh.  Better to come at 1045 than 1130 am for lunch.  They don't handle crowds well since they are so new.  This is a welcomed addition to the Elizabeth area.  I would also suggest you try their daily specials.  That is the best value for your dollar."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sandwiches.  I usually make mine a wrap and it is still a good size.  Prices are good too.  I've noticed it has been busier lately.  It seems people are finding out about it."}
{"text":"So, I am sandwich fanatic and search out all the hot spots to find the perfect one. After passing this location a few times and just ignoring it I saw Tonya's review and pictures, and decided to add it to my list. Working from home last week I had 30 minutes before my next call and decided to make a drive over to 7th street to check out Sandwich Max.  After walking in I was greeted by the Manager/Owner who walked me through the menu, told me about their specials, etc.  Being my first visit I decided to stick with a usual, turkey with swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo and onions.  The sandwich was made to order and I was out the door in less than 10 minutes.  After arriving home I opened the sandwich and I was very impressed, it was huge! And, the taste was great. Fresh bread, perfectly sliced meat and condiments.  Along with sandwich I ordered the potato salad, also very fresh and a mayo base which I enjoy. Knowing about this place I will remember it when I crave a sub sandwich and the usuals don't cut it."}
{"text":"If you think Harris Teeter, or Publix subs are great then you're in for a treat! Best subs in Charlotte hands down. I've been about 5 times now and yet to have a single complaint. All the staff is up beat and attentive. They don't skimp on any ingredients, just an all around great place to stop and grab a quick lunch. Keep up the good work guys!  Oh and btw they have free sandwich punch cards (who doesn't like those)"}
{"text":"These subs hit the spot! At first I was questioning why my sub came out to $10 but once I got my order and saw how massive my sandwich was I understood why. Tasted amazing and now I'm full."}
{"text":"We've ordered the turkey provolone two separate times this week, for the most part, it was good. The first time I ordered, I was a little disappointed with the amount of filling the the sandwich, not as much as I had hoped. In fact, that first sandwich had half as much filling as the Jersey Mike equivalent. Their \"standard\" way is similar to \"Mike's way\" but, I think jersey mike's is more flavorful. The bread however, I like better than jersey mikes. The turkey provolone we got today was much better than the first, they really packed it with toppings. I got a very filling sandwich for two for about $9.50.   I will be back for more when the bf picks up his dry cleaning at Kim's cleaners next door."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Sunday and my order was delivered even before time requested. Sandwich was very good! The tuna salad was delicious! Will be ordering again very soon and glad to know I have another option different from panera that is close to the birth center I will be having our baby at."}
{"text":"Salads are AMAZING!  I like that they are fresh when you order with so many options.  Everyone is super friendly. I've had wraps, subs and salads, never disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing subs and free delivery! Sometimes a bit of a wait for the delivery around lunch time, but I don't mind. I go for the Italian sub every time and I'm always a happy customer."}
{"text":"I am a weekly visitor at Sandwich Max. Sometimes twice if I can make it. We love the ham and cheese and the Italian sandwiches. Hearty sandwiches that are sure to fill you up. Staff is always friendly and helpful. We love Sandwich Max!"}
