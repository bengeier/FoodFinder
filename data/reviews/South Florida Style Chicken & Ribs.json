{"text":"Great soul food period , it's get no better, come and get it. They have lamb too !! Chicken, ribs, bbq chicken and sides to boot !! Pure awesomeness !!"}
{"text":"South Florida resides on the east side of Charlotte inside of a convenience store....a little sketchy but the food is really good.  They serve breakfast all day(chicken and waffles, fish and grits, etc) lunch and dinner.  They are grilling chicken, ribs, and pork chops right in the parking lot and although I haven't tried the ribs, the grilled pork chops and chicken are perfectly cooked.  I also tried the fried chicken, green beans, lima beans, potato salad, stewed squash, and seafood salad...all excellent!  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the Mac n cheese.  They also offer homemade desserts, fruit and salad.  Great addition to the soul food scene!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I can't believe it almost taste like my 100 year old grandfathers food, God rest his soul. Even though these guys are displaced and have opened up shop in Nubian Queens Restaurant, they did not let that come across in the food  they prepared! I'm a patron from here on out!"}
{"text":"So this place is in the c-store. A little skeptical of the atmosphere but go in the day time and it's alright.  My food was good . I had turkey wings yams and green beans.  Very good turkey wings. Yams were not to sweet just the way I like it.  Will try again.  Sometimes taking a chance works!"}
