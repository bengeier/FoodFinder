{"text":"I was recommended the Boho salad as it's the most popular choice. You can definitely taste the freshness of the veggies, and the rotisserie side chicken I added was moist.   I stole some of my friends Caribbean sauce that comes with the chicken orders. All great tasting.    The prices are on the expensive side - A small salad is $8, large is $11.50 and protein add ons are about $4-5.   It would be hard to justify coming here when you can easily go to a sit down restaurant for the same price. The quality is there but the portions aren't big enough that it would fill me up."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre.   We both had a rotisserie chicken sandwich and then split a salad and a side of roasted sweet potatoes.   The buns on both our sandwiches were charred beyond belief. I couldn't understand how they would let a bun that burnt go out the door. The beet and apple slaw was so overpowered by horseradish that all I could taste in each bite of the sandwich was horseradish. Scraping it off did nothing. The chicken was dry and flavourless and the avocado looked like the guac you get out of a tube at the grocery store.   The salad was nice but nothing special and same with the roasted sweet potatoes.   I love the Harbord Room and loved HR&Co but skip this place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I am shocked that Flocked is considered a restaurant that rocks... the chicken is bland and mushy, both under and over done, greasy and dry in each piece. The salads are a cacophony of textures and clashing flavours signifying nothing. The sides were awfully underdone bordering on raw. Overpriced and overhyped. I offered my dog some and he refused.  I had to throw it out;  poor raccoons."}
{"text":"Two chicken fingers up!  Ordered on Ritual for my first time here as I was in a rush for lunch. Order was ready as promised and quickly walked in and out.   Was initial concerned about portion size but am now one stuffed bird despite being quite hungry before this.  I had a small boho salad with pulled check own.   Overall, love the variety of flavours, textures and temperatures (?). Will order there again. Perhaps we slightly less dressing."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch. The greens have so much flavor and content!  I had the Boho Flock and it was superb  my husband had the power flock and it was good as well. The full size is quite large. The Flock Stock soup was wonderful. The pumpkin seeds gave it a nice 'chew'. Awesome spot for lunch and it is reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the overpriced salads but well below that for the mediocre hot food. I've had better grocery store roast chicken. Can't understand what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Great manager, super friendly staff. Really great food. Boho salad was really tasty, I keep thinking of this salad. After visiting the Adelaide location, I think the vibe of this flock location could use some work."}
{"text":"Let's start with the things they get right. The service is excellent the wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The place is nicely set up and the ambience is great.  I ordered the 5 piece fried chicken platter. It came with a coleslaw and a cheddar biscuit. The food left me wanting. Although it was presented very nicely the flavor just wasn't there. The fried chicken was bland and boring."}
{"text":"Delicious mac & cheese!  The fried chicken sammy and the chicken tacos were very good.  Pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich, just okay, a little watery and could have used more spice.  I would have given this place an extra star except our server forgot about us and did not take our order for ten minutes (we were ready to order when she filled our water glasses but she walked away before we could stop her).  When we looked around for her, she was busy at the bar trying to figure out how to make a drink.  It was like slow motion.  When she did finally come back, we told her that at this point, we were in a hurry, we had a meeting to get to and had thought that we had budgeted for enough time.  She took our orders seeming a little miffed.  She came back with a full water carafe and slammed it onto the table...  When it came time to clear the table, two other servers came to clear and collect payment.  I will definitely come back but I'll budget for extra time and make sure the server knows when I am ready to order."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant 3 times so far, and each time it's been awesome! The food is consistently tasty and fresh (and I am a picky foodie and nutritionist) and healthy, the servers just the right touch of helpful and friendliness. Highly, highly recommended.   p.s. the last visit did leave us with the impression that the portions were a bit smaller than before, but we were pleasantly satisfied (without dessert even) so that's not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Very good.  Everything tasted fresh and was surprisingly well presented and well seasoned.   I was disappointed they don't do breast on the deep fryer but I'm still giving this place a 5 because the server Mandi was absolutely outstanding.  Great service that is friendly approachable and engaged at this level of establishment is wonderful and s treat.  Oh ya. Try the corn and the fries are awesome"}
{"text":"We want to love this place very badly.  The food is great the atmosphere is adorable. But, every time we go, no matter who we are with, the conversation at the table always focuses on the horrible service and not the delicious food.  Unless they hire more staff it's best as take out."}
{"text":"Friend and I were looking for a quick bite and found this fried chicken place! Place was full/fully booked and we were lucky to get a bar seat! Ordered their kale/pineapple juice ($4) and shared a 5-piece chicken platter ($20). Chicken was crispy, tender and juicy! Server was attentive and atmosphere was relaxing. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday for lunch with co-workers. Based on the reviews below, I was expecting the service to be mediocre. Thankfully, our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. The only bad thing I have to say is that they messed up my boss's order... they fixed it right away but I don't think they apologized at all.  I got the power salad half size and added chicken for extra protein. The salad was delicious as all the ingredients mixed very well together. Salad dressing was also great. The portion wasn't the biggest as I got hungry 2 hours after lunch, which is normally the case when I have salad for lunch. I enjoy making fancy salad at home so I know how expensive the cost can be - I see the reason behind high price."}
{"text":"Service 0/5 Food 2/5  I have been to this restaurant twice. I have never had a good experience in terms of service. They tend to have a bunch of new servers who don't really know what they're doing. Management is very arrogant.  The food is extremely mediocre. I really don't think I would come back again."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch at Flock on Christmas Eve and it was quite delightful! The portions were okay, but the salad was definitely worth the drive! I had their Mac and Cheese and was not disappointed. It's listed as a side, but it was substantial enough for me for a good lunch. The others had chicken sandwiches and the half chicken and everyone was happy with their choices. I like it that the menu isn't terribly enormous; it makes choosing a lot easier. The food was very fresh and the servers were attentive but not overbearing. I will definitely go back here for lunch."}
{"text":"Yellow Light, not sure I would suggest it to you. In a hurry and hungry I went in. I was served very fast with what they technically offer: Chicken. They do nice good looking salads too but I had half of a chicken and sweet potatoes with a side of green spicy sauce. Taste of the entire dish were not amazing even if I was expecting something good with their presentation that says \" NATURALLY RAISED WITHOUT HORMONES OR ANTIBIOTICS\". It may have been healthier but taste wasn t there. Self Service. There are no tables and you got to eat on the windows where some space is provided to lay your plate. Naa."}
{"text":"I had the frenchy flock with chicken added on. I believe it was $8 plus a couple of bucks for adding the chicken. Overall it was just alright. The salad was definitely fresh and the small serving is plenty for 1 person. The chicken was very bland so it would be wise to blend it really well with the salad or ask for extra dressing/spices for the chicken.   I didn't try anything else although the chicken sandwich sounded yummy. Maybe i will check it out next time I am in the area.  Important- they do not take cash. Debit/credit only."}
{"text":"We arrive a few weeks ago to find out that 1/2 of their items were sold out and that we would have to wait around 45 minutes in order for the food to be prepped. As we were waiting we were served by a rather intense server who came back on 4 accounts in order to get our orders again. All in all the chicken tasted like it was coated in flour and was slightly gritty & lacking seasoning aside from their spicy sauce. I came excited & left disappointed."}
{"text":"The chicken here was average and fairly dry. They are health conscious and don't add as much salt as other restaurants.   The salads were amazing, in my eyes this is a salad place. The beet salad I will order every time I go back here. Was also impressed with the side of beans-they are spiced really well.  In sum, if you are looking for a tasty chicken place, try a Portuguese barbecue instead. If you're looking for a healthy option and want to try a hearty unique salad, come here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered a chicken leg with chimichurri sauce and a mac and cheese. Generally not that busy during the lunch hour, and this place has a great patio for a nice summer day.  Admittedly the chicken leg portion was a bit small, visually at least, but reasonable for $5. When coupled with the very heavy and savoury mac and cheese it adds up to a satisfying meal. Chicken was well marinated and moist on the inside.Plus the chicken is naturally raised without hormones or antibiotics. Maybe just pure marketing but at least it makes me feel healthy when eating it.  Mac and cheese was a slightly more mature mac and cheese. Came in a cute mini staub casserole dish. The cheese did not feel cheap, nor was it too salty or greasy. I think they did a good job making a traditionally very heavy dish feel slightly less heavy.  Overall I really like this place as a lunch spot. Not sure I'm fond of the menu structure though. For example while a salad at flock looks affordable, you have to remember you pay for the chicken as an add-on. As a result things can still get pricier than you imagine fairly easily. On the plus side though they have many mini sides which means it is great for sharing!"}
{"text":"Flocking good chicken! I got a half chicken and multiple sides and a salad for the vegetarian in the house. Everyone was happy and that chicken was amongst the better birds I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Tasty salad, ingredients were fresh and of very good quality, great concept.   However, my takeaway workweek lunch somehow came to $17.50 for an average sized lunch salad with chicken (no sides or drink).This is insane even by financial district pricing standards. They then tried to charge $.50 extra for hot sauce when I asked if they had any when picking up my plate.   The food is really quite good, but if you want a good \"desk\" salad routine place stick with Mams, Pumpernickel, IQ, Crave etc., all which can offer similarly creative options for ~$12."}
{"text":"Yay! They opened up a sit-down Flock!    I'm a big fan of the original outpost on Adelaide, where it's take out salads.  So I was super pleased to see they were opening a sit-down version where THR&Co used to be, at Harbord/Spadina.    The only disappointment is they don't have make your own salad like they do at the original (like, where's the cauliflower, dudes?!)  Positives include a big open room, beautiful natural light, and the music level is actually appropriate!  You can hear your dining companion from across the large booth!  (And they're playing 88.1, who doesn't like that!)  Choices appeal to many dietary restrictions, including vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free.  I tried three salads (half-salads, sharing) and I enjoyed all three, the dressings were really good.  Didn't need to add meat to make these textured or filling.  A welcome addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch today and had an amazing experience. First of all, this restaurant features an extensive gluten and dairy free menu for fellow celiacs and gluten sensitive individuals.   Second, this restaurant is great for small to medium sized groups. We had a group of twelve people and all had a lovely time. The servers were attentive and we never had to try to get there attention like you do at other restaurants where they forget to refill your water and bring you your order.   I ordered the power flock with a few changes and it was to die for. The salad bowl reminded me of the bowls you buy at Freshii or Fresh and it tasted delicious! I finished the entire thing and I would definitely return to enjoy it again. Some of the other gluten free people ordered tacos, which I had no idea were on the menu (I'll have to go back and try them) and they said they were really good.   All over, everyone had a really good time and enjoyed their meals.  I would definitely return for another visit!"}
{"text":"I decided to order from Flock because Ritual had a deal.  I ordered myself a half size Power Flock with pulled Rotisserie Chicken(+$4).  I really enjoyed the ingredients of the salad, they crafted it very nicely.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 4 is because of the portion size does not reflect the price.  Perhaps, since the chickens are raised naturally without hormones or antibiotics, it comes with the price.  Otherwise, the salad was delicious!"}
{"text":"I loved THR & Co but I understand that the flock concept is cleaner, less fussy and definitely more \"of the moment\", in terms of healthy and simple eating. That said, I don't know if these dishes deserve such a beautiful space. I had previously enjoyed the boho flock salad in the grab-and-go style of the downtown location but something about this great space overshadowed the food, making it seem kind of boring in comparison. I'll be back to sample more goods and shall see if there's anything more to write home (or to my fellow Yelpers) about."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant that serves healthy choices. I loved the colours of all the salads and food it's simply breath taking. I ordered the chicken with coleslaw and corn bread along with a salad.  Everything was fresh and food surprisingly looked the same as menu pictures.  The service was great and the restaurant was modern yet vintage. The service was friendly and everyone was very helpful when I needed something.  In terms of the food it tasted great and fresh. The amazing thing about this place is after eating you feel not heavy or bloated but awake. Healthier choices are so good for you. If your looking for a good local spot with healthy choices I think the flock is an awesome pick."}
{"text":"Had the fancy flock salad today. Great prices for fresh, quality food. I love that their menu is vegan friendly! Portion sizes were big, and the salad is more filling and larger than Kumfert and Kim's. Very pleased with my order. There is seating, but it feels more like a take out kind of place."}
{"text":"Decent chicken sandwiches are served here. One  sandwich is close to 10$ and was not enough for one  person. So you need to order fries which comes separately and is around 7$, so after tip and tax you end up paying 20$ for a normal lunch. The place looks cute. They claim they use healthy chickens with no antibiotics.  Overall it is an over priced delicious meal in a nice place."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd crave salad but I do. Great portion and absolutely delicious...my fave is fancy flock. Heart emoji"}
{"text":"had the PULLED ROTISSERIE CHICKEN SANDWICH.  Great service friendly and fast for a made to order sandwich.  Was  a touch dry and the bun ended up being a little soggy.  Could have done better with a crispy baguette but great flavour and price for what i got."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for dinner and had to come back twice this week (once to pick up lunch and last night for dinner).  The menu is varied and interesting, while keeping several options for vegetarians (even though it is a chicken restaurant and all), gluten-free, dairy-free, and I even noticed they have Halal options.  Last night, we shared the three dips, vegetarian poke (which is similar to a dip as there is no rice), Boho salad, chicken, fries and green beans.  I love that there are enough choices on the menu (even as a picky eater), many of which are healthy!  They also have a great patio."}
{"text":"Contrary to reviews, one must sample on their own for your own assessment in determining whether a restaurant is worth returning - not going.   This is a neighborhood hidden gem, that takes reservations, which is a huge win for me as I like to plan.   Unique food presentation, attentive service, and comfortable decor enhanced our dining experience. I had feared the chicken would be desert dry (as some of the reviews had suggested), but it wasn't any different than what one would expect for white meat. The dark meat as usual, is the juicier of the two.   Flock's unique flavour is worth the trip. The accompaniments are also very good. The only reason why a 5-star wasn't issued was the Mac & Cheese dish came out cold on the inside and warm outside. Upon returning and getting a second chance, the inside was just a touch warmer, but not hot as we would have liked it. Might this be a time constraint reason (a tad rushed)?  My next return trip will be a request to have the Mac & Cheese done \"well done\" such that it would be piping hot inside. Perhaps more ideal for the cold winter months, and it was intentionally done this way for the scorching hot summer patio weather days."}
{"text":"I had read in Toronto life that they had a good chicken sandwich. It has avocado & beet slaw, lettuce, crispy onions & crunchy Apple.  I was hungry so I didn't take it apart but I did notice something crunchy which gave it nice contrasting texture to the chicken and avocado.  It was 9$ plus tax.  Overall I thought it was a very decent meal. Was it my favourite chicken sandwich..no, it wasn't out of this world but it pretty darn good!  I'd get it again if I'm hankering for a chicken sandwich. Though I might try their fried chicken sandwich next!  So went back and tried the roasted chicken with Caribbean sauce. Nice. Not spicy but just good blend of flavours. Also had the salad boho flock. Very good too. My only so-so was the sweet potato fries as I thought they were spiced and I barely tasted any spicing. Their key lime pie was awesome. Light not heavy! I'd go back for the pie. If you're in the mood for chicken, it's a great option."}
{"text":"Flock is a quality rotisserie chicken and premium greens place. Though I cannot comment on the chicken I do enjoy their bomb-ass vegetarian/vegan salads.   Ambiance: - Clean, modern decor and upmarket fast food restaurant vibe - Friendly and efficient service - Reasonably spacious areas for waiting and tables if you want to stay  Food: - Rotisserie chicken (whole or less) or in sandwich form - Sides including potatoes and steamed greens - Carnivore and vegan friendly soups - Awesome vegan/vegetarian salads chock full of goodies like raw beets, goji berries, grated coconut, daikon and pomegranate seeds.  - A few desserts for those with a sweet tooth  I've seen other reviews say the salads are overpriced. For the financial district and considering the size and number of more expensive 'superfoods' in there I'd say they are on par (as long as you don't start adding extras). The salads are really high quality and very healthy. 'Boho' is by far the best salad in my opinion. I think 'fancy' has too much cabbage considering it also has radishes, it's overpowering. You need to add avocado otherwise it's a little dull, and that pushes up the price.  If you're looking for a little extra try the Harbord location. They have extra menu items and to stay bowls, and they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Great food. Bad service. I hate when this happens. The staff here are so indifferent it was actually a struggle to get their attention for some water even after we'd ordered a full meal and wine. They failed to bring our bill after we asked twice so we had to make our presence known that we actually dined here and wanted to pay. So we could go. The rotisserie chicken is tasty and the salads are great - but man. A little nice goes a long way... and there wasn't much warmth here from the staff unfortunately."}
{"text":"Chicken was delicious but the sweet potatoes were meh. I called ahead to ask if they can accommodate Celiac and told me it's no problem, the chicken is just.... chicken....with seasoning. I like that, simple. The green sauce was great and I heard from others that the Mac n cheese was great also. The sweet potatoes alternated between under and over cooked, I would try some of the greens next time"}
{"text":"So impressed!   Came here at 11:30am on a Sat and we were the only ones there. Love the vibe,  metal letter decors,  light bulb lightning,  coloured bench couches and even the waiters are dressed very hipster.   The staff are all extremely outgoing, polite and easy to talk to. They came by frequently to ask if we needed anything.   I got the pulled chicken sandwich ($9+tax +tip). I was a bit iffy on getting it from the mediocre reviews for another flock location,  but I am so glad I ordered it! This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  Mostly due to the fresh toasted buttery bun that's soft,  crispy with sesame seeds.  But the sandwich itself has layers of flavour, from the creaminess of the guac,  to the crispy onions,  to the sweet tartness of the horseradish beet apple slaw.  All these flavours compliment the star of the sandwich,  the chicken and don't overpower the chicken taste. I like how their chicken is antibiotic free too!   The sandwich also looks very visually appealing with the bright colours (lettuce and beet sauce) on the light blue plate.   My friend got the chicken sammy sandwich (fried chicken).  Although it was delicious, he had a bone in his. We weren't sure if that was a mistake or it's common,  but before we got the chance to ask,  the general manager came to us and apologized about the bone and that it was a mistake. He said the sandwich is on them and seemed very sincere about it. He apologized several times.   This gesture says a lot about the company and how they take their food quality and service very seriously. The fact that they own up to their mistakes is very commendable and respectable.   I love the ambiance,  service,  food and concept of Flock. I also love how everything has their signature subtle chicken flock imagery everywhere,  from the menus to the signs to the rugs. I'm definitely coming back, and I recommend trying the pulled chicken sandwich  I'm surprised the place was empty at that time amd that it was rated only 3.5 stars... it deserves better!"}
{"text":"I always thought that if you're going to specialize in something, it better be damn good.   I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.  However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect.   I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars.   If you're going to do chicken, at least learn how to make it right."}
{"text":"Took out the Pulled Chicken Sandwich.  Good but not special.   Chicken was moist and Sesame Milk Bun decent but really liked the Horseradish/Beet/Apple Slaw.  Passed on the Avocado which is a standard accompaniment.  The portion size was OK so at $9.00 only represented fair value.  But given they are only three blocks from home do plan to return for a whole rotisserie chicken, a side of sweet potatoes & one of their elaborate salads that the folks sitting next to me were quite pleased with."}
{"text":"Fabulous salads and chicken and sides in a wonderful atmosphere. Quiet! Excellent, attentive but not intrusive staff."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on coming here but apparently it's quite difficult to find a place to eat on Harbord on a Saturday between 2-3pm because most of the restaurants were closing to prepare for dinner or something. I ended up being satisfied that we came here though.  The chicken was good but eaten by itself was a bit lacklustre. The sauces that go with it are a must! Sides were delicious and I liked the healthy choices they offered (way more than a side of steamed vegetables). I had my daughter with me so I ordered from the kid's menu for her and found their servings incredibly large! That could be a good thing if one is a fan of packing up leftovers or getting another little meal to eat after they finish their own (I happen to be the latter).  Our server was really nice considering my toddler wanted to walk around most of the time and wasn't happy when it was time to sit. Good thing the restaurant is quite spacious (but note that there are no change tables) and our server offered crayons and a colouring book to keep her occupied (at least for a little while) so Mommy can scarf down some food.  I would come again if in the area and accompanied by people who aren't the most adventurous when it comes to food. Nothing crazy here just good ol' fashioned chicken (more expensive than Swiss Chalet therefore better quality?). Maybe next time won't be so happenstance either."}
{"text":"We had a few drinks while waiting for takeout. So we were not there for more than 20 minutes or so but we had a blast with Ashley and Omar and the other blond bartender (didn't get her name). They were great. We laughed so much. Good bunch. Just got home and are eating the chicken and it is super delicious.   Disclaimer: were high. But all the same. Such good service and food."}
{"text":"The food is damn good, but Flock's growing pains in the transition from the Adelaide pick-up spot to this new sit-down restaurant on Harbord are apparent.   The price point is a bit off for the quality and portion size and the service isn't quite where it should be. You pay slightly too much and the servers are over worked.   I think Flock is a welcome addition to the rather competitive Harbord St restaurant corridor, but it'll take more time before these guy have settled in."}
{"text":"KIMCHI GREEN BEANS.  Everyone focuses on the chicken. I mean, yes, it's really good and natural but, my god, dem green beans!!! Sweet, succulent, and perfectly paired with  kimchi. How did Chef Vitiello come up with this combo?   Consistent quality, friendly and fast service, delicious food. I've been picking this up via Ritual 3-4x/week. The app allows you to easily request changes or substitutions. If the resto is taking longer than usual to finish the order, call them.  Typical financial district prices; post-tax, it's ~$13 for a full salad and ~$5 for the marinated green beans. Skip the sandwich - it's tasty but the value/food ratio is sooo off."}
{"text":"I got really excited to hear that Flock would be opening on Harbord - I used to trek all the way to Adelaide for their delicious salads!   I went last night hoping for the same yummy salads I get at the Adelaide location. I got the Boho flock and added avocado and chicken - because this place is a sit down, they don't make the salad in front of you as they do at their original location - it was about a 5-10 mins wait for take out. I have the say the portions are MUCH smaller than the Adelaide location, which is disappointing when you pay $19 for a salad.   That said, i still love Flock but will be going back to original Adelaide location for my future visits :)"}
{"text":"Went to Flock last night for dinner, really loved the food. I'm celiac and there ended up being tons of delicious options for me. The server was a little strange however, when I mentioned I was celiac and couldn't have any gluten, and then asked if the salad I was hoping to order would be okay, she replied with \"well you tell me. Look at the ingredients and see if you're fine with them.\" This was pretty unsettling as much toppings such as nuts, dressings, and other garnishes often have gluten without warning on the menu.  Regardless of that the food ended up being great, a little pricey for salad but the portions are huge and the toppings are premium and plentiful, and for the price of the side of chicken you do get quite a lot!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice place and atmosphere. The food is good, very different from other places around bloor st. i ordered fried chicken sammy, love the bun! It's so crispy. My friend tried the rotisserie chicken, it's so tasty even without the sauce. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Shockingly tasteless, mediocre food. Where to start... Flock is beautifully designed, and the patio is lovely. It's very photogenic. I'd heard so much hype about the \"chef\" owner here and the transition from THR to Flock, and I really expected something more substantial. After dining here, my overall impression is that Flock isn't a restaurant, it's a concept. Everything about it screams FRANCHISE NOW!!!! And frankly, that's just awful. It's super boring to look at a plate and think - that purple slaw isn't there for taste or to add value to the dish, it's only purpose is to add color for Instagram. It's ridiculous to look at a dish and see clearly that this food is cheap to prepare, and that you are charging too much for it, but it looks pretty, so people will keep paying for it. We ordered staple comfort foods like fried chicken and mac and cheese. It's hard to make these classics flavourless and forgettable, but Flock manages it easily. To quote another Yelper, \"I don't know if these dishes deserve such a beautiful space\" - that statement is spot on, I couldn't agree more. My 5 yr old basically summed it up when she said \"Mom, I really like this restaurant, but the fried chicken  and mac and cheese you make at home is sooooo soooo much better\".  This is like the Olive Garden with better design and comfort food. If it doesn't taste good, why bother??"}
{"text":"I went here for a weekday lunch with a family friend.  She had been before and recommended the place.  I absolutely loved it!  We each had the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich, and split the half \"Fancy Flock\" salad.  The amount of food was perfect for the two of us.  Both the sandwich and the salad were excellent!  I will definitely plan to check out Flock's other locations.  Highly recommended.   *UPDATE*   My husband recently discovered Flock through work, and since we had both enjoyed our respective experiences, we decided to go back to the Harbord location together in the middle of a Sunday afternoon.  We had our 8-month old son with us, and the restaurant was extremely accommodating, providing us with space to park the stroller, bringing us a high chair, bringing us hot water to heat up his food, etc.  (I know, standard stuff one expects when they have a kid, but still appreciated.)    Perhaps our biggest praise for Flock has to do with the fact that I had been having difficulty getting our son to eat chicken at home, and yet we gave him some of Flock's rotisserie chicken and he gobbled it right up.  Perhaps my son just doesn't like my cooking.  :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, less than mediocre service.  Came here last night with my family and some friends and was quite underwhelmed. A couple of us ordered chicken, and a couple of us ordered salads. The people who ordered salads got their food way before everyone else, so they had to sit and wait with their food before they could actually eat. The salads were not that big for the price and the sides are extremely small. The chicken was nothing special either; definitely could go to Swiss Chalet and get a better one."}
{"text":"Can tell just about delivery option. Fast, tasty, healthy! Salads are always big, fresh, tasty! Chicken also looks natural and healthy.  Happy that I found them ) May be little bit pricy but it worth this. Wish their team all the best!  Highly recommend to those who tryes to eat healthy but appreciates not just good quality of food but taste too."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch when I'm in town and in an emergency, I order it delivery. I always get the power flock salad -- so good, with beets and pom seeds. I order a chicken breast separately and cut it up for the salad. I think the chicken tastes better than the shredded stuff they throw on when you order your salad + chicken. So much food, I can split it over 2 lunches."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating in at Flock when I have a girls lunch or dinner. And even more when I take my daughter out for a lunch. What I always forget is how slow and forgetful the service staff are, especially when I'm there with my daughter. Waiting 40min for a chicken breast and fries is obscene, within a half empty restaurant with 5 staff. And no surprise, my 6 year old daughter loses her mind as well. Note to staff: your location is in the middle of a neighbourhood with moms that lunch with kids...serve them first. Serve them fast, so that we can get on with our day."}
{"text":"This place was such a wonderful experience. My sister and her boyfriend initially went here and then at a later to date we all went here together as a family! The food was great; healthy, filling, flavourful. Going there and getting the food, tasting it, experiencing it, speaks for itself!  The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, everything one desires in serving staff!  I would definitely return. Didn't get a chance to have a fully fledged dessert but had a couple samples of their sweet potato pie and key lime pie... definitely dream about that one... awwww drool!"}
{"text":"I only eat their salad.  They absolutely taste good, flavorful, with lots of ingredients, but are little pricey."}
{"text":"One of the healthier options in downtown Toronto.  I came here for lunch and the service was quick and simple. You choose what you want in a bowl and you can also customize any ingredients that come within the preset combo. They have a variety of things to choose from, such as pomegranate, vegetables, and different nuts. You can also add protein for extra. All the ingredients are Super Fresh. The price is not extremely steep for a simple salad place, as certain places here in downtown sell a small bowl of just vegetables for more than $15."}
{"text":"Ordered the Power salad and coop soup. They taste good but it's so overpriced! $5 for a tablespoon of chicken?! Come on, Flock. Be a bit more reasonable with your pricing for the quantity."}
{"text":"Overpriced salads. Only tried it because there was more than one location and because of Yelp reviews. Wouldn't go back and definitely not paying $15 for a take out salad again."}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW:   I've been an avid Flock fan for the last year and a half. Not exaggerating, I've eaten probably over 150 Boho and Power flock bowls for dinner over the last 1.5 years. It's my go to option for a healthy yet satisfying meal. The ingredients are fresh and the portions are fair. Even though the prices are higher than other salads, you get what you pay for in freshness and quality of ingredients.  MY FAVS:  Boho Flock Power Flock   NEW: Fuji Flock - Asian inspired with tofu and seaweed, it's a twist on a classic salad but it's delicious! I ate it without the dressing that was provided.   TIPS: - Order the chicken leg or breast and shred it separately for your protein add on - it's more juicy compared to the already shredded chicken they add to your salad - Ask for dressing on the side, since they tend to go a little heavy on the dressing for my preference  Available on both UberEATS and Foodora. I order Flock on UberEATS as it provides more options for additional toppings (eg. goji berries, cucumber, chickpeas)"}
{"text":"1.) The place is casual which is an improvement over the previous snooty establishment. 2.) Mandy was awesome. 3.) Buttermilk fried chicken is difficult and theirs was great. 4.) Rotisserie chicken is easier but again theirs was great. 5.) The absolute home runs are the salads.  We had the marinated kale. 6.) The service, wait time on food and prices are all exceptional.  We paid $59 for an order of fried chicken, a 1/4 dark rotisserie, a full kale salad and 2 beers.  I call that a deal for such high quality food.  We left 20%.    We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't ever leave feedback on yelp, but this place is terrible and I feel like people should know before wasting their time.    A couple of weeks ago I saw them turn away a group that drove down from the suburbs just because they felt like closing an hour and a half early on a whim and did nothing to compensate the group.  They were perplexed.  I was perplexed.  Tonight I called to place an order for pick up and they put me on hold for 20 minutes, until I hung up and called back to get there machine.  They still haven't called me back lol.  Honestly, there's too many great places to get delicious food from in this city to give this place any business in my opinion."}
{"text":"Flock is a utilitarian fast food spot serving chicken and greens in the downtown core. Their third location recently opened on Richmond Street. By focusing on quick service, healthy meat/vegetarian options, good branding, and a welcoming atmosphere, they've become a popular lunch staple for workers and those passing by.  Must-try items: Power Flock Any greens or chicken combination  The Power Flock salad is an amazing combination of raw, natural, tasty ingredients. It's packed with a variety of flavours and textures, and can be topped with chicken for an additional charge. They've also got rotisserie chicken and side dishes, which means I'll be coming back to try everything they offer (sooner than later).  The staff here are friendly and can help recommend something for you to try on your first few visits. It's quite comfortable and clean, so if dining in is a preference, no need to worry."}
{"text":"To be honest a little disappointed - we ordered take out - which was actually missing chicken ( key ingredient ) for this restaurant ! We ordered the boho and the power bowl , the portions were a little miserable size wise , considering the price . We will give it one more try -however the first impression is certainly not a lasting impression"}
{"text":"The chicken is very small so they r like baby chickens or small breed . If u r hungry better order the half chicken than \"leg/breast) it's about as \"big\" or \"small \" as grocery store pre cooked chicken. But the chicken here is much better seasoned and very tasty ! Usually a lot roasted chicken don't have much taste under the skin, the chicken here the meat is tasty n tender soft . They def seasoned well long enough :):)   The dippings--- YUK !!! The green one tasted like raw watery grass juice, I had never tasted anything like that before ! N the creamy (looking) one u have to pay extra 50 cents for is just as bad. I can't explaine the flavour it just tasted YUK like grass juice. My bf n I both ditched the sauces aft 1 st try . The chicken tasted good on its own. :):):)   Beers r not cheap. We ordered 4 Ace (toronto brand) beers . Ace website each can is $2.75 if u buy 24 at time . Came to table in Cans. U pour yourself lol. They charged him $9 each when menu says $8.5 each . We didn't realize it till got home. Not really worried about $2 but seems unusual everything else on the bill is itemized n descriptive n long when Beer on bill just says beer n it \"happens the wrong beer\" x 4 .  Wait staff is nice n warm. The place is very inviting . The only thing I can mildly think that is slightly annoying is my wait staff kept tossing my hand tissue away half way thru my eating. Hey when I eat 2 chicken legs can't really use knife n fork . It gets messy n sticky one point , I'd wipe my hand to use my phone or grab water before going back to eating . the waitress looked at my tissue as I was eating , debated n paused for about 3 seconds n grabbed me my bf's tissue n left as I was chewing left me with both hands sticky n oily. I don't think she is being rude by any means , I suspect she is neat  freak can't tallorate partially used tissue/napkin on table siting that it's eye sore for him.  I wish she replace fresh tissues for me each time tho. Becusee she doesn't come to table often so it causes quite bit inconvenience in the end aft we ordered second round of chicken n tissue was \"stolen\" 3rd time . She was chatting a customer at bar in deep convo. My bf was bad customer for once that stole the tissue wrap next table for me --- heeheeeheee   Over all it's cute inviting space ! I would come back for chicken and the coconut squash soup! Not the salad! Salad is just bunch things thrown together looks nice but nearly not as flavourful as it looks. It didn't have much taste to it lack of any flavour.  I am sure some ppl still dig it since I know a lot ppl like plain tasting salads. :):)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great chicken then this is the place. Rotisserie or fried, both were absolutely delicious.  The sides of Mac and Cheese, green beans and rapini were delicious accompaniments. And the salads! Great ruffage with full flavor.   Even the olives in the martinis were tasty!   Thanks for the fantastic meal."}
{"text":"The food was yummy, somewhat healthy and simple!  I love that they source their chicken well.   It was a great spot for a simple meal- would go back again.  The decor was inviting but not overdone- it was airy with a patio.  The service was friendly but very slow."}
{"text":"The salad left a lot to desire. My initial impression when I revealed my half size takeout Frenchy Flock salad was \"where did the other half of the salad go?\". Flock had downsized its half size salad since its inception more than a year ago.   Frenchy Flock is reasonably delicious with mixed Greens & arugula, vine beans, crispy onions, roasted cauliflower, french lentils, sweet peppers, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, hard boiled egg with roasted tomato, olive, caper vinaigrette.   I was unpleasantly surprised by the proportion size of the salad - left hungry."}
{"text":"There are many wonderful places to eat in the heart of the financial district in Toronto and Flock is definitely one of the better lunch options. The prices are somewhat high, but the quality and flavors are worth it. There were many tables in the restaurant, which makes it convenient to meet with friends or colleagues, but you can also take away in convenient containers.  On the purely protein side, there was only the rotisserie chicken or the pulled chicken sandwich. They also have a lot of salad bowls. I decided to order the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potatoes. The pulled chicken sandwich was so good. There were so many ingredients and the chicken was so juicy and flavorful. It had a bit of sweetness and a bit of spiciness. The side of sweet potatoes were tasty and had a bit of spiciness as well. It had a tanginess from lemon juice. Although I liked the sweet potatoes, I thought there was just too much lemon juice.  Overall, I thought the food was great and will be back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Strange booking this place. My friend saw an article about THR. Then she called and booked a reservation. We couldnt find it because the place said FLOCK instead. Ok our bad, the article was an old one.... but so strange how they would not change their phone number when changing the restaurant, even if it is the same owners. fyi there are articles out there with the old restaurant. Anyhow I was expecting to order a fish dish, but since this is all chicken we just settled in and I thought, hey try something new.  Decor is nice. The food is not that bad. Some asian salad thing we got was great for sharing. The cocktails did not appeal to me so I decided to get a cider (9$), the rest of the cocktails were discounted for their promo night (12$). I like that they have some GF and Vegan options. Nice that the chicken is antibiotic free. The taste of the chicken and sauces were only ok. And there you have the two stars. I didnt finish the chicken leg so I asked for it to be packed, it came with the chimichuri sauce and slaw we added from the other dish.   The rest? Well Our server took off most of these stars. Though friendly enough, she had a forceful tone, slight annoyance possibly. We had to ask for water, she asked to remove our plates during the middle of dinner, and the worse part is when the bill came. My friends noticed that ALL the drinks were under \"cocktails\", even if I had the cider. The server (the bill said server: cash) INSISTED that all drinks go under the name cocktails and that the amounts are hidden in there. Well there is the promo of 12$ for the two cocktails and 9$ for cider....Even with this explanation she said yes, the cocktails are 12 each,the total there is 34$ with a stern glare... \"well I can go back and get the breakdown of it all but I promise you that those are the correct amounts\". It was getting ridiculous and it seemed she was getting annoyed and pushing back so we let it go. Ever get those people that talk forcefully back that you just doubt your own thoughts? Well, apparently she cant add or she punched in the wrong thing and did not want to admit it, or she thought the 1$ was no big deal. In the whole scheme of things, yes 1$ is no bid deal, BUT the principle behind it is another and the crappy attitude we were served as well.   To top it off I opened up my take home this morning to only see the chicken and slaw, no chimichuri sauce! Seriously?! How dense is this girl??? Was it an off night for her? If so she may as well should have stayed home!  Will not be back and will not recommend. The attitude and poor service is not worth the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Better seen as a fast food joint than a real restaurant. We were in/out in 45 minutes. Waiter was rushing us almost as soon as we sat down, and rotisserie chicken came with 10 minutes. The white breast meat was dried out. Obviously not prepared to order. Awful french fries and inedibly over-spiced rapini. Really indifferent service."}
