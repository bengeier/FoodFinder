{"text":"An article was released about this place.  So my adventure begins.  The place is a hole in the wall and very clean.  The atmosphere is very friendly but parking is not great.  The service is great and food I enjoyed so much.  The chef Omar was kind enough to explain some of the dishes.  Great place to eat good food."}
{"text":"Need fancy intimate decor and ambiance?  Not here... instead you'll get polite service and pretty darn good food.  Don't let the interior (or exterior) discourage you.  Having absolutely no experience with Peruvian cuisine I had not idea what the carapulcra would be.  It was definitely a different take on 'stew', but it was delicious and they even stack your rice into the shapes of temples.

{"text":"We went for Friday lunch.
The food was of mixed quality. Agreed it;s a different cuisine but not worth the two hours( yes you read that right )  wait we had to do."}
{"text":"I love El Chullo! I grew up in Peru and I've had a hard time finding good Peruvian food in Phoenix but boy, El Chullo gets it just right! I would go more often if it weren't that pricey. I mean, considering it's a \"hole-in-the-wall\" type of restaurant, I think their dishes are a little overpriced. But it's delicious for sure!"}
{"text":"Positive:

Great service, friendly, genuine people. Family-owned and it shows.

Appetizers are awesome. Best I've had in a Peruvian restaurant in Arizona. The anticuchos are just right and ideally spiced, the ocopa was perfect, the papa rellena was delicious.

The spices and general flavor is authentic, rich and tasty.

There is a good variety of dishes, some of which you can't find elsewhere in Arizona.

Presentation is good, sides are well chosen. Portions are bigger than average for the entrees.

Lucuma ice cream tasted just like in Peru.

Not so good:

-Dishes are somewhat overpriced.  

-The arroz con mariscos could use more seafood, more limon and more aji. It was too greasy and not spicy enough.

-Although the food was clean, and so were the napkins and silverware, there were a few bugs crawling on the floor. It's understandable. The weather is heating up. I just never saw that many in a restaurant. Some pest control would be a good idea.

Overall, I recommend this place for authentic Peruvian food and family ambience. It's cozy and fun. You just have to be choosy about what to order so it's worth the money and tastes good!"}
{"text":"Came here for the pisco sours after watching an episode of booze traveler. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the drink is, very sweet! I ordered the cilantro chicken soup, it was delicious. The soup tasted just like homemade chicken soup with a cool green color! Would definitely recommend for date night or small (2-4) groups!"}
{"text":"Flavors here are awesome. Everything is delicious. Great pisco sour too! Highly recommend these very authentic flavors."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!  I had the amazing opportunity to eat at this family owned and ran business. The food was outstanding and so was the service. I will definitely recommend  this to friends and family."}
{"text":"Omg this is definitely a new favorite! I really didn't know what to expect. As soon as the doors opened the aroma was unbelievable. Everything looked delicious. I settled on the rice with sea food and it was wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  We had the tacu tacu and a pork tamale as the appetizer. Everything was well seasoned and fulfilling. The only down side was the price. We went for lunch and paid dinner prices ($35 per person about, without a drink). The place is small,  too, so I can see seating being a problem."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here. We weren't sure what to expect, and as the cuisine was unfamiliar the help from our waiter was much appreciated! I really love when people take the time to explain the food their serving with knowledge and passion. The food was interesting and very tasty. Come here for a not too out there adventure and a departure from the regular burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Literally, everything is delicious. Brought my Peruvian dad who often is not impressed, he likes it better than our regular spots back home. 
Appetizer combo, Lomo Saltado this time. Even the cocktails are delicious."}
{"text":"Consistantly very good.  My wife is peruvian and I am very familiar with peruvian food.  The food is better than many restaurants in peru.  I love the anticuchos, and causas.  The lomo saltado is great, arroz con pollo also.  Escaveche de pollo was brilliant, but was a little too over spiced.  Also loved the Lucuma ice cream. Solid 4.5  stars."}
{"text":"The next best thing to actually being in Peru. 

The beverages were great - the Pisco Sour and Chicha Morada deserve 5 stars by themselves. The entrees were also a hit. I ordered the Aji de Gallina, and my boyfriend ordered the Ceviche. He was so blown away by the Ceviche that he wants to go back for it every weekend. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the appetizer. We ordered Yuca Frita, and it was a little over-fried for my taste. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience. I am from Peru and felt like I was eating from my family's kitchen. I will mention that it ended up being a bit pricey, BUT it was worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin, so let me say this - El Chullo's food is TO DIE FOR. A Peruvian friend had told us about the place two years ago, but somehow we got around to trying it only last night. It's a small, homey, family-run restaurant. The people running the place and running around the place are genuinely friendly, as if they've invited you to be a part of their home, food and lives. 

We waited near the bar for about five minutes while our table of six was getting ready. I ordered a pisco sour which was amazing. Then there was the food. You know how a server walks past you with a plate of food that turns heads? That was happening with every single plate of food that came out of El Chullo's kitchen. Everything looked so delicious that it was hard to make up our minds about what to order.

I am a vegetarian, so I was pleased to see a vegetarian section on their menu. Our group ordered appetizer platters, fries, tacu tacu (vegetarian and seafood versions), ceviche, deep fried sea food platter, frijoles con seco a nortena, and the veggie version of peruvian-chinese fried rice.

OH. MY. GOD.

We worked on the installments of food for about two hours. Everyone shared, laughed and loved every single bit of it. Of course, I had to stick to vegetarian food but let me tell you, it wasn't a compromise at all. In fact, my meat-eating husband loved the veg tacu tacu and fried rice so much that we are still fighting about who gets to eat the leftovers.

The portion size of the entrees was BIG (I'm not sure what dish the guy, who says portions were small, ordered). Appetizers were just that, appetizers, so that you can save space for the delicious food. The food was spicy without being hot, not that we would have minded that. Pricing was reasonable and at par with other similar dining places. Parking is available in the back.

But wait! I forgot to tell you about dessert. Of course there's the delicious Leche Asada and Crema Volteada, but the husband ordered Alfajores, which is a layer of caramel between two cookies. I think we died and went to heaven because tasting that thing was an out of body experience.

It has been a while since our friend circle has come together and bonded over some delicious food. It has also been a while since we discovered a new cuisine. I now count Peruvian food and El Chullo among my favorites cuisines and restaurants."}
{"text":"Hello, I have  been going to this restaurant for probably five years now. I have come to rate Peruvian cuisine, the best in the world, in my opinion. As far as that last review by a lady named Leslie, I think she was way too hard on them. Some of the very very very best restaurants are just small little places, and family owned.! Sometimes you have to have patience when places like that are busy. They always always are welcoming, so she must of had an attitude problem. And that's probably hitting the nail on the head! I love this place and so do many of my friends. Don't let it get you down, El. chullo! We still luv you!  It's the best Peruvian food in the whole valley! And I've been to the other ones. I could tell you way way way worse stories."}
{"text":"This restaurant need not spend any money on advertisement. The food speaks for itself..loud and clear. I am not familiar with Peruvian food but if this is as close to authentic as it gets, I am a fan. Me and friends tried the Tacu tacu ( how can something that sounds so cute not taste good) and the fried rice. The food is well seasoned and flavorful. The service is very good and the portions are very generous. For desert we had the  Leche asada and alfajores. I did not think i could like caramel before i had the alfajores. For drinks, try the pisco mango. 
This place deserves a first visit and then a repeat visit with those who havent been here ( thats how i was initiated!) ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have been to Peru and I can say this place took me right back. Not just because of the incredible food (the mixed ceviche was just delicious!) but also because of the sincere kindness of the staff. Our waiter gave us his suggestions and was extremely accommodating and attentive! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and I can say with confidence that I will definitely be back. Thanks, El Chullo!"}
{"text":"AMAZIING Peruvian food!! They make an awesome pisco sour and the ceviche was incredible! You have to get the lomo saltado!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I had just finished up a tour of the Heard museum and was starving. So we browsed yelp and found this little gem. There is limited parking in the front, so we drove around the back where an ally way led to the restaurant's back parking lot, it was a tight squeeze to get to the parking lot so if your in an SUV or full size truck it's going to be tricky. 

We went in and sat down and was greeted by the chief who was very accommodating and upbeat. The restaurant is clean an cozy the way a ma and pop place should feel. We ordered an appetizer of fried yucca that came with two sauces that were amazing! For drinks we ordered Chicha morada a Peruvian drink made with corn and spices, it was one of the best drinks I have ever had. In fact we had four glasses of the stuff, unfortunately there were no refills for Chicha but the chef gave us our last glass free! Regardless it's worth it. 

For our entree we both got the ceviche. OMG, I kid you not it was the best ceviche I have ever had. The ceviche was bass seasoned with red onions lime and Peruvian chilis. There was a side of inca corn and sweet potatoes, the potatoes added a refreshing sweet to the tangy ceviche. My cousin who lived in Mexico for two years said he ate ceviche regularly and said that Peruvian ceviche was the best you could get.  Please give this place a try you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay...little too salty and it takes a long time to get order. For the cost I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Good cerviche. Fried fish was a bit heavy. Place didn't run their a/c. Checked their thermostat next to the bathroom and it was 91 degrees in the place. Towards the end of the meal it was difficult to even be in there anymore. It's 105 outside today, there is no excuse for not running the a/c. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to rate this excellent food a 5, but now only a 3.5 only because the price increases.  The dishes we order each went up $2-$3 each so now rather than be an excellent pricy lunch it is very expensive (e.g. Tacu tacu dish with steak is now $19.95) - wow that's too much!.

Unfortunately, I won't be back soon but that's only due to the recent price increases."}
{"text":"The brunch was divine: mouth-watering pork, fried sweet potatoes, and bread that could have been manna sent from Heaven. If I could, I'd be here every weekend. The waiter who was from Peru told my fiancé and me all sorts of stories about his homeland, its traditions and its food. Definitely one of the best brunch experiences I've had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok nothing really special so I am so surprised by all the great reviews. Restaurant is small and they don't have proper ventilation so you leave smelling like fried food. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went a few days ago. Service could've had been better for a place that wasn't so packed. 
We had the papa la huancallina (always been a favorite), arroz chaufa y tallarin verde w/steak.
Steak was a little on the salty side. To drink we had chicha morada which was bomb!
Food was pretty good however, did not like the fact that they brought one of our plates 20 mins apart. Reason why I gave them 4 stars. I'd probably go again."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience here.  Papa a la huanca was ok.  The lomo saltado however was excellent.  Well cooked, well seasoned with a hint of Garlic.  I posted some pics below.  The arroz con pollo was excellent as well, the cilantro was prominent throughout the rice and was well seasoned.  I have been to many peruvian restaurants across the country, and this one is the best in AZ hands down."}
{"text":"Decided to to try something different, new. Picked this place out of the blue.  I am super glad I did. Everything I tried was a little different but delicious.  Definitely coming back. A must try."}
{"text":"I'm very glad my wife and I finally got around to trying El Chullo, a little hole in the wall off 7th street.  I got the escabeche de pollo.  The chicken is described as pan fried but it didn't taste fried, and I mean that in a good way, and the sauce was very tasty.  My wife loved the tallarines verdes-- pesto spaghettis (yes, spaghetti with an s) and steak.  And for dessert: a giant alfajor, cookies with dulce de leche filling. Overall, a great first Peruvian food experience"}
{"text":"Really disappointed, I ordered the lomo saltado in beef and a casa rellena for takeout. When I got there the food was already bagged up and when paying I got charged over 30 dollars for 1 entree and a very small single sized appetizer. I went home and saw my food was soggy and looked very old like it had been sitting out for a while. I was pissed. I should've gone to red lobster at least you know what your getting for the price. I'd give this place a negative star if I could. And I love Peruvian food!!!!"}
{"text":"1st time. Absolutely fabulous. Great flavor in every bite. Friendly staff  and Pisco! !!!"}
{"text":"My first time and I'm gonna bring everyone i know to this place! I've never had Peruvian cuisine before, so I can't judge the authenticity. However, I've had chicken and rice dishes in other cuisines and this is by far the most flavorful! People were friendly and helpful. I'm gonna be back soon for the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to write post for months. Dated a Peruvian for over 5 years and been in Peru many times. This place is not your run of the mill Peruvian spot. Authentic food with a gourmet touch. Look forward to returning"}
{"text":"This little gem is a 3 minute walk from us and it's delicious! A must try for some authentic Peruvian fare. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was so good I had lomo saltado and arroz com mariscos yummy and amazing people who work here they sang me happy birthday :)"}
{"text":"Great, great little restaurant. Having traveled Latin America for a while I was excited to try some Peruvian food. And it was great. The beef cuts I had were one of the best marinated pieces of meat I have had. And for desert I had this Argentinean cookie called alfajore... It was great. I love small places like this that do good right and are simple. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Peruvian food in town!! I have been hesitant to write this review because I wanted to be selfish and enjoy this spot without the huge crowds it can easily draw!!  Not a place to rush in and out, it's place to be enjoyed with good company and great Pisco. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Consistantly very good.  My wife is peruvian and I am very familiar with peruvian food.  The food is better than many restaurants in peru.  I love the anticuchos, and causas.  The lomo saltado is great, aji de gallina also.  Escaveche de pollo was brilliant, but was a little too over spiced.  Also loved the Lucuma ice cream. Solid 4.5  stars."}
{"text":"Love their food! Mixed ceviche is one of my favorites. Great place, very clean, good atmosphere and every one is very friendly. They know how to keep costumers coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good food being Peruvian from the Northern region of Peru this place is very good and the flavors are like being back home.
The Ceviche is good I always call to have it prepared ahead of time because that is the way we eat it in Talara Peru.
Love the anticuchos and Helado de Lucuma 
Will in Phoenix tomorrow that is my hangout.
Arriba Peru Mundial 18"}
{"text":"Pros:  Food, service, price.

Cons: Smaller sized restaurant (may be occasional waits), parking (park across the street - see parking section below).

The food here is amazing.  I had the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado, which is rice and beans topped with strips of marinated sirloin steak.  The rice must be cooked in a small cast iron skillet and flipped over, because it has a seriously delicious exterior with a slight crunch.  The beans and lomo saltado are equally excellent.  Portion sizes are large, and they have a small selection of wine.  Really delicious and highly recommend.  

Parking: After business hours (ie: 6:00pm) you can park either across 7th street at the auto shop, or across Virginia street, just south of El Chullo, in the parking lot behind the 3 story building (Techniprint)."}
{"text":"Incredible flavors and great service. As an individual who spent a lot of years in Peru I can appreciate what has been the best Peruvian food I've had in Phoenix - at El Chullo! Highly recommend the anticuchos, lomo saltado, and an alfajor for dessert. I look forward to my next dining experience here! (Probably tomorrow!)"}
{"text":"So impressed with this place, peruvian food is comfort food to me and every peruvian restaurant that I find in phoenix always ends up closing down but I sure hope this place sticks around the food is absolutely amazing and spot on with authenticity! The service is also great our server was very nice and did a great job! This is definitely my new favorite restaurant and I will be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"WOW\" the ceviche was super delish. I've tried a few peruvian places in the past and El Chullo wins in my book. I tried both the ceviche mixto & the ceviche with fish and they are both amazing dishes. I really liked the flavors. I also had lomo saltado and same thing the flavors were soooo good. This is my new favorite restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! What a nice surprise. I feel like I should always try these tiny places with \"foreign\" food but I never really do because I'm afraid most would be misses rather than hits. This was a hit and has inspired to try more places like this! Our friends had heard good things about this place so we gave it a shot and I will keep going back!

We ordered a few apps to share: Anticucho, Papa Rellena, and Yuca Frita. We loved them all! The Anticucho and Yuca Fritas were so good I will definitely order them every time I go!

Then each of us order an entree. I got the Arroz con Mariscos, Jess got the Arroz con Pollo, my fiance the Ceviche and Josh the Lomo Saltado. 

To be honest I was pretty disappointed with my dish because it was more like a plate of rice with 4 pieces of seafood. However, Jess' Pollo tasted amazing, it had great seasoning. Mike's cveiche and Josh's Lomo were great too. We all left stuffed and happy!

We will definitely be going back. Love the vibe of a family restaurant. We also recommend the Pisco Sours!

It is a tiny place so if it's full you may have to wait. It'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"Great peruvian and very authentic. Love this place. Their ceviche did not skimp on the fish and was very good (very different from Mexican ceviche.....just in case you were wondering)."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was fantastic which is amazing because we've been searching for a good central/South American/Spanish restaurant.

Arroz verse con pollo was perfection.  Potatas con queso was amazing as well.  

Plantains were perfectly ripe and had a delicious crisp. 

Ceviche was also delicious.

We also took the famous dessert to go which we have not yet tried but looks fantastic.  This is definitely our new spot"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday on the recommendation of a famous local restauranteur and everything he said about the family and the food was absolutely true.  Wonderful culinary experience and added to our list of favorite locally owned and operated restaurants."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!! Where do I start? Service was quick and hospitable. Our server, the owners son, was such a friendly guy and very helpful. My husband got the Tallarines with Seafood. Creamy pasta with tons of seafood! Totally worth the price. I was recomended the Escabeche de Pollo. Oh boy! Finger licking sauce and perfetly balanced dish. This place is legit and authentic. They take pride in their food and you can taste the love. The chicha was delightful. We were here on our anniversary and the experience was much more than I anticipated. Please come and fall in love with Peruvian food."}
{"text":"Finally, a true to flavor Peruvian restaurant.  I've been to several in the Valley but non compare. This is the spot to enjoy a variety of delicous Pisco Sour concoctions along with all the favorite traditional dishes such as Lomo Saltado or Tacu Tacu. They also have several other options that are unknown Peruvian inspired.  Check this place out,  it rocks!"}
{"text":"5 WELL-DESERVED STARS!!!! El Chullo is a small and unassuming hidden gem so we ended up passing it and having to turn around, but it was so worth it! Honestly, we had reservations and a Living Social deal at another Peruvian restaurant but ditched that place to come here because of the great Yelp reviews and SO GLAD WE DID! This place has both the best Peruvian food and the friendliest service of any Peruvian restaurant there has been in the valley for at least the last 20 years. We've tried them all (including some out of state) and by far this place has the best alfajores we've ever had- luscious creamy dulce de leche sandwiched between delicate creamy colored disks of flaky, buttery, goodness- oh my!  I'm still dreaming about them. The lucuma ice cream and chicha morada are also must tries. The chicha morada was refreshingly smooth and light- almost like a fine wine. We also had the appetizer sampler, the tamal, the aji de gallina, the jalea mixta, and the bistek and tallarines verdes. Next time we'll order the papa rellena and/or the yucca on their own (the sampler sizes were pretty small) and skip the tamal. The warm welcoming friendliness of the family/staff made our experience such an exceptional one that we ended up ordering a lot more than we planned and enjoying ourselves immensely. We love supporting family-owned businesses and Esperanza and Chef Omar and his cute sisters are so nice they make you want to come back again and again- well for them and the Alfajores :). I only wish it wasn't 30 mins. away, but so good it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We loved the food at El Chullo always looking for food that reminds us of our child hood Peruvian favorite foods . The Lomp Saltado was amazing, 
Thank you 
We'll be back soon

{"text":"I am so in love with this little place! I have lived in the Coronado neighborhood about 5 years and have seen many things go in and out of this location...i have a feeling El Chullo will be sticking around. Everything i've had so far has been AMAZING. The Chupe De Camarones soup and Tacu Tacu De Marisco were seriously out of this world. The service is also excellent. They are so genuinely friendly and make you feel right at home. Can't say enough good stuff about this little gem...and i am beyond picky with restaurants, especially in Phoenix. It is the best restaurant on 7th st. by far in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Large portions that were delicious. Staff was friendly and informative. Omar is the chef and he took time to explain the different dishes. This is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the \"lot\" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.

Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, \"small\" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are \"very large\".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to \"snack\".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).

We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since \"papa\" means 'potato').

I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.

The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).

While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it.  For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine.  If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards.  No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full."}
{"text":"Very hard to find a good Peruvian restaurant that stays in business over a year. This one is by far the best one I have been to and I think it will be around for a long time. The food was delicious and very very close the the real deal in Peru. The ceviche was perfect, the lomo saltado was perfect and even the drinks were authentic Peruvian. I just wish it was closer to my house but it's better than nothing!"}
{"text":"The food here is actually better than a lot of the food that I had in Peru (not sure what this means). Our favorite is the arroz con pollo with cilantro rice, aji potatoes, and pickled onions. The chicken is so flavorful, moist. The rice has pieces of the giant corn in it.

We've also tried the ceviche, escabeche de pollo, carapulcra. All great.

Love how they serve cancha, the Peruvian corn nuts, as a pre-meal snack!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and authentic, fresh, flavorful Peruvian food. So happy this place is open! Amazing job so far. Love family spots!"}

I certainly recommend this peruvian restaurant.

{"text":"don't let the location keep you from entering this little gem.  excellent food. papa rellena is a must try."}
{"text":"Love the food! Excellent service. Highly recommend El Chullo Peruvian Restaurant."}
{"text":"Well I was just visiting Phoenix and needed a lunch spot fast. Stumbled across this place and could not have been happier with the food and service. This is not fine dining, it is a neighborhood place with as close to homemade latin food as you can get. I started with some yucca frittas which were great and came with two very tasty salsas. I had a chicken dish (forgot the name) with a red sauce that was slightly greasy but packed with flavor and delicious. My friend had the arroz con pollo which was also excellent. Crap even the iced tea was apparently homemade. The server was attentive and made us feel at home. The place doesn't look like much but it is a great place for well prepared Peruvian food at good prices. I will definitely go here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for bunch on a Saturday. The place is small, but cozy. The menu is small, but offers quite a bit of variety.

We decided to split a platter for two. It came with fried sweet potatoes, fried pork, and tamales. All were very good. The sweet potatoes on the bottom did get a bit salty. We also threw in a Peruvian version of torta. Unfortunately, I can't actually remember the name of it. 

All in all, the place was excellent. Great service and great food. Definitely a winning combination.

N*joy..."}
{"text":"Flavorful, fresh food; friendly staff; charming decor that evokes Peru.  An excellent choice for those looking to try a new cuisine."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Peruvian food, but I thought the food here was really good. Service left a lot to be desired, as there are only about 6 or 7 tables in the place and somehow it still took our server over 5 minutes to bring us water and about 30 minutes to put our order in. What could have been a 35-45 minute meal turned into over 1 hour... not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place, very small, quaint location. There is a humbleness about the atmosphere that makes this place very relaxing, The food is phenomenal. grilled beef heart, ceviche, potato stuffed with beef and fried, it doesn't get better."}
{"text":"The reason I rated it ok was due to the service.  The food was excellent.  It is a small restaurant and we went on a Friday evening (myself and another person) We were told we would have to sit at the bar because the tables for 4 people were being held for people of 3 or more. the bar is right at the front door so I didn't feel comfortable sitting there. I spotted an empty table for two near the window and asked if we could sit there. We would told yes (why she didn't ask us if we wanted that table in the beginning, I don't know). We were given menus and ordered our food with just water for beverage. It does take a while for the food to come but the portions are good and the food was delicious. I had the ESCABECHE DE POLLO (chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar), my partner had the ARROZ CON POLLO (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & chicken). The waitress never came back to refill our water or check on us. Customer service is big with me and even though the food was excellent, I'd have to rethink going back."}
{"text":"Amazing culinary roller coaster of international flavors and spices can be found here. I ate my heart out...El corazon (heart) was a lot better than I imagined. The ceviche was so good (and spicy) we ran out twice. The Peruvian national drink (Pisco) flowed like water. Omar was our server. He has a really cool tattoo of the Peruvian Nazca Lines (hummingbird). Go often. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The best ceviche mixto! The lomo saltado is always on point as well as the tallarin saltado. My favorite Peruvian spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Location is cute although the Parking situation isn't the best. 

Service was exceptional by a young girl. 

Our first time trying Peruvian  food and or server explained some items which we ordered. They also offer great Peruvian beverages like the inca soda. The food was simply delicious in every bite. I seriously can't describe it any further at the moment since I am so stuffed by the food! 

Certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"Coming from Miami it is so difficult to find good authentic Hispanic food out here. Specially Peruvian! But oh man so thankful for this place! Love their food, as close as you can get to authentic Peruvian here in Phoenix. It's a tiny hole in the wall but so worth it! Aren't those always the best places tho? This is a for sure must! Lomo saltado and jalea mixta are great! Also the antichchos!"}
{"text":"The seafood soup is delicious! I ordered the beef with the pasta and it was so good! Will go back"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. I get cravings for their delicious cause rellena, which is a stack of creamy potato purée, chicken salad, avocado, and egg with creamy mustardy sauce. Their lomo Saltado is sure to please with perfect strips of beef in a delicious mildly spicy sauce, with a triangle mound of white rice and French fried potatoes. I highly recommend this locally owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"Divine Peruvian food. I had the PAPA RELLENA & the chicken escabeche which both were amazing. I also drank the pisco drink w ginger ale which I like better than pisco sours. I'm going back here ALOT, I'm Peruvian and this is authentic food w fantastic flavor. Can't wait to try their ceviche and seco next time I go....."}
{"text":"When a friend asked about the table about other Peruvian restaurants in Phoenix, my Peruvian friend said, \"none are worth going to.\"

Needless to say, this place is great! 
I've been several times, and the food is always delicious. My favorite is the Tacu Tacu with lomo. I get it every time, but I know I should try other things too! The ceviche and lomo soltado are also very good. The ceviche is fresh, and the lomo just doesn't disappoint - full of flavor! 

This time around, I fortunately had a friend who was wanting to split two dishes! I forget the one she got (it's in the pictures), but it was a beef stew. The beef was very tender, but we both agreed the Tacu Tacu was better of the two. The Tacu Tacu has a great consistency and texture. It's crispy on the outside and firm, not mushy, on the inside. The lomo that comes with it is in a sauce with onions and tomatoes - very flavorful! 

The ooooooonly thing that I'll say bad about this place that it may be a tad too salty sometimes.  

Overall, I'm a big fan....and I need more people who are willing to split dishes with me!! :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I went here on a whim with a co-worker and I'm so happy we randomly picked this spot. Both of us were new to Peruvian food so we had a ton of questions for our waitress. She was very patient with us and answered all of our silly questions and gave us both great recommendations! Both dishes (fish Ceviche and the TACU TACU CON LOMO AL JUGO) were both super flavorful! I ordered the ceviche, mainly because I was a little scared of trying anything else. Haha I know I'm a wuss sometimes. Anyway... The ceviche was FABULOUS. It was super fresh and like I mentioned before, super flavorful! I tried my friends Tacu Tacu dish and it was also awesome! Both dishes came with a very large portion! Neither of use could finish our plates. 

So, my only dislike was how expensive this place is!! It's defiantly a dinner place and not a lunch spot. I ended up paying 30$ (including tip) for just my lunch. To me that's pretty steep for lunch... for dinner I wouldn't mind paying that much but woah!!! I'd love it if they had a lunch menu with smaller portions for a little less expensive. 

All in all my experience was a good one and I'll be back but only for dinner."}
{"text":"I will start by saying my wife is from Lima, Peru.  We have been all over the world finding local peruvian places to eat (military family). This place is amazing!  Small place but gives a family feel to it. U can smell the spices while the food is cooking. Amazing rocoto sauce and cebeche was awesome as well. Everything tasted like it was from Peru. Will go back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came here one evening when I was in Phoenix for work, very authentic vibe with a super friendly staff. I ordered the cause rellena & the chupa de camarones (seafood soup). I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was in PHX for the day and really wanted some Peruvian food since there aren't many options in Tucson for it. This place had great reviews and a friend of mine also suggested it so I had to try it out. We called ahead of time to get a reservation and they said they could \"likely squeeze us in\" which was strange since there were not many people there when we arrived. We didn't get a very friendly vibe from the service in general.
Our table got the fish ceviche, chicken tacu tacu and the seafood tacu tacu to share. The food was really great but it was all really salty! I generally like my food to be salty but it was even too much for me. In the future I would make sure to ask for less salt on the meals. Otherwise it was really flavorful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is Peruvian and we came here bc of the reviews and obvi the food. The service was awesome and the food was even better. It was a huge place but its good and my boyfriend said it taste like home."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. It has some minor work to do but it earned the five starts. Service was excellent, half the food from our big group came out fast, the other half not so fast, but it was still worth the wait. Appetizers were fast and held us through. Very authentic Peruvian food. I had the Chaufa, its Chinese/Peruvian food and excellent!
I can't say enough about the Pisco Sour. The best I've ever had including in Peru!!! 
Well return for more. Cheat day restaurant for my family."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and wonderful pisco sours. They have great vegetarian and meat options. Highly recommended if you are looking for something different near  downtown. The ceviche is incredible!"}
{"text":"Peruvian food is eclectic. It's accessible. It embraces multiple cultures and influences from ancient Aztecs to contemporary and cosmopolitan Lima. It's both familiar and exotic. And when it's done well, it can be both hearty and elegance. Superb ceviche,followed by an equally great rice with seafood and shared a dish of green linguini with a pesto sauce that was delicious.
Can't wait to go back to try more items."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents (my mom is Peruvian).  She gave it a 4.75 stars outta 5!   Delicious food.  Great service.  Good pricing.   I highly recommend this place if you want delicious Peruvian food!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the small store front fool you; this place makes up for it once you are inside. Delicious food, very authentic. Glad to have found this. This is the place to come to really have a taste of Peru. They have cultural tv as well. The workers are very nice people."}
{"text":"Wow ... delicious food, and fine service ... they get crazy busy though (we ate lunch at 2:45 p.m., and even at that hour there only a couple of empty tables) ... unless they expand, you will have to take your chances on getting a seat, or be very patient."}
{"text":"One of my fave date night spots. Feels very homey and food is authentic and so tasty you can almost forgive the super long wait times for food during peak hours. Ceviche, Aji de Gallina, and lomo saltado are my faves, but everything I've tried has been great. 

Parking can be a bit of an issue - they have a small lot in the back which can fill up (DON'T park in the adjacent parking lot just past the restaurant). Definitely worth all the trouble, though!"}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant with no ambience but  great food. There are a little over 12 tables so be prepared when you walk in. There's also some seating at the bar. On the plus side, they do accept reservations, which I had. 

We ordered the causa rellena with crab. Although flavorful, it was served cold. We also ordered the frites which were excellent. 

For the main course, I ordered frijol con seco a la norteno. It's served with rice and beans. My friend ordered the pork chop. Both dishes were excellent. 

Be prepared for slow service and a relatively long wait time for your food. When I went, there was one waitress and one cook."}
{"text":"Great food and service...   Had Lunch on Valentines Day .... 


MUST HAVE --- Pisco Sour drink which is made with  -fresh lime juice, cinnamon & cloves syrup, beaten egg whites, angostura bitter.

ARROZ CON MARISCOS
Sautéed rice & seafood mix.


Only issue is parking very limited space ....."}
{"text":"Tiny spot with limited parking but worth it for some tasty food that is likely different than anything you have had before. The Papa a La Huancaina looks meh but the taste is fabulous! The fried rice dish was so tasty and plenty for me to have lunch the next day. It's a little expensive for an ethnic hole in the wall but the food is good enough that I'm sure Ill be back for more. They are super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Parking is a little hard, they have limited space in front but have a parking lot in the back via an alley. 

The place is very clean and quant, I loved the decor! The menu is very easy to understand with descriptive and have a variety  of options.  The server was very nice and answered all out questions, he told me they make the meals with a medium spice but can request it to be more spicy. I would def recommend this place it's very good!"}
{"text":"My trip to AZ isn't complete until I come here.  I HAVE to go every time I visit.  This is the best Peruvian food I have ever had.  Whatever you order will be amazing, I have had damn near everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand why this place gets such high marks from most people.

I will say that the employees there were very nice - unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. We had three appetizers and three entrees. The appetizers had virtually no taste and the entrees were so salty you just couldn't taste anything else. My friends both agree that the food had no flavor other than salt.

This is the only Peruvian restaurant that I am aware of in the valley and I wanted so badly to like it but the food is just horrible and it is expensive - the bill came to over $100 for three of us. Pricey for nothing but salt..."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing! Try their appetizers they are delicious! And of course their seafood"}
{"text":"Yummy. I ordered the ceviche pescado HOT. It was super hot but the flavors are so amazing and tastes so good. Definitely worth the heat but I gotta say the ingredients did not disappoint. I also had the flan, was never a big fan of any flan. But this is real deal flan"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix and couldn't figure out where to go for food.  I typed in my favorite Latin dish, arroz con pollo and came across this place! Glad I found it! My fiancé and I were pleasantly surprised with how good this small place is.  Every table was full on a Saturday night.  We weren't used to seeing this in Phoenix.  The arroz con pollo was so good! We also ordered ceviche which was bomb.   The texture of the fish was perfect.  I also tried a pisco sour which was excellent."}
{"text":"What! I don't know how I've been missing this place. The traditional Pisco sour was amazing, like an alcoholic, less sweet, key lime pie. I had chicharrones, a stuffed potato pastry that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Both were served with lime juice and cilantro marinated red onions that gave the dishes such perfect balance. A pork stew for my entree and I was stuffed to the gills and exceedingly pleased. The staff is crazy friendly. Will go back four to five million more times."}
{"text":"Decided to treat my wife and one of her lady friends to something different. I've had this place bookmarked for ages and never seem to be in this area around eating time.

This is a really cool family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Peruvian style artwork as well as several articles and \"Best of\" awards displayed proudly on the walls.

We came for the lunch service which starts at noon. The menu is loaded with a good variety of Peruvian favorites. It was tough to choose what we wanted and took advantage of the photos on Yelp to decide. The server was also most helpful and gave us a good idea on how it would taste.

We started with an appetizer plate that had a mixture of three different items. See my photo. The Papa Rellena was our favorite in the grouping. It is described as a golden-fried creamy potato dough stuffed with meat, eggs, raisins and olives and served with red onions marinated in lime juice. So good!

The ladies ordered a dish with Rice & Peruvian beans topped with a cilantro Beef stew called Frijoles con seco a la norteña. Yours truly ordered one called Escabeche de Pollo with a side of their spicy homemade Hot Sauce. It is pan fried Chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar.

Both the food and service were spectacular. The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly and helpful. We even had the chance to talk to the chef and get a couple of top secret tips that she uses in her recipes.

This is not a very big place and the parking area is really small out front. They say there is also additional parking behind the restaurant with a back entrance when very busy.

Can't wait to eat here again and maybe even try recreating a couple recipes at home. This stuff is plate licking crazy good. Just try and restrain yourself and use a spoon. Simplemente Delicioso!

4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Excelente comida, el ceviche mixto, el lomo ufff.  Definitivamente estaré de regreso a esté sitio, súper recomendable"}
{"text":"I had the Papa A La Huancaina which is boiled sliced potatoes covered by a spicy cheese which has Aji Amarillo (yellow pepper). I thought the potatoes and cheese were great but the Aji Amarillo in the sauce is definitely an acquired taste.

Ordered the Passionfruit juice which was delicious. Also, ordered the Tallarin Saltado Con Carne which was tenderloin lean strips with sauteed red onions, tomatoes, green onions, and spaghetti. Since it was not dry, but stew like with sauteed items, my best description of it is a fajita stew. Highly recommend.

The one drink, plus an appetizer, plus an entree, came out to $30.

Also, the place is small, so not the best for groups."}
{"text":"The passion fruit juice was delicious, and the steak lomo saltado will be the best thing you have eaten in a long long time. The marinade on the plate is to die for..."}
{"text":"What a great change of scenery (diamond in the rough) El Chullo restaurant. Visited today for the first time and experienced great service, great food and overall value for my price. Will most definitely be back. A must try in the Phoenix area for any locals or visitors.  Muchas gracias to my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with a meetup group to this place.  It's so small, only a local would notice it.  I'm really glad I went.  While it seems to take forever to get meals, it seems because they really put a lot of care into the cooking and presentation of the meal.  For a little place, they don't just throw the food on a plate, but present it with rice molded in pyramids or hemispheres; appetizers can be multilayered in cylinders...all colorful and super flavorful.  But a number of the dishes do rely heavily on rice.  The one I had, which was basically rice with brown sauce and mushrooms and beans with a few other veggies, had the unique taste that the rice seemed crispy on top, like it had been run through the broiler.  I think it is these touches that may help take time to get the food.

But the waitstaff is friendly and was more than willing to make suggestions to those at our table that knew nothing of the cuisine.  

Try the non-alc Peruvian drink...it is delicious, with a nice taste of cloves.

I like the unique flavors and generous portions and very reasonable prices.  Just don't expect to be in and out.  Good place to come with others to pass the time and chat.  I'm putting down \"NOT good for kids\"...because I don't think they'd have the patience."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and it's definitely worth the try. The staff is extremely nice, the food is amazing and their especial desert is phenomenal.  I've had Peruvian food in the past and got my wife to try it for the first time. She loved it! We r definitely coming back! This place is a diamond on a hay stack!!"}
{"text":"Slow service but the food is great so prepare yourself with patience. Love the ceviches and papas rellena. Beef hearts are great."}
{"text":"On my first visit here I tried the causa rellena and the ceviche mixto. The causa rellena was a very flavorful potato and crab (the filling I chose) appetizer which was so dense that the dish could have been a meal by itself. I was already feeling a bit full when my entree arrived - a beautifully presented ceviche generously loaded with seafood. Needless to say, I was extremely full that visit and managed to happily waddle to my car. On the second visit I tried their tasty lomo saltado and capped the meal with an alfajor, a confection consisting of two delicate cornstarch cookies with a filling of scrumptious dulce de leche. The excellent quality of the food justifies the prices that are slightly higher than you may initially expect from a restaurant that does not have a fancy atmosphere. Service is friendly and efficient, and although parking is limited in front of this establishment, there is an additional parking area at the back, accessible through the alleyway behind the commercial strip in which the restaurant is found."}
{"text":"Best ceviche I have tasted outside of Peru (as good as that of La Divina Comida in San Jose, Costa Rica)! Great family run restaurant. If you want authentic Peruvian food then this is the place for you. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Amazing Peruvian food! Wow. The prices are affordable, but not cheap. I got the Lomo saltado, the beef was tender and sooo savory. Everything was super fresh. Another person at our table got the ceviche, it was huge and delicious! What a great find!!"}
{"text":"Lucky to have found a good Peruvian restaurant. I have always enjoyed their food, and this is a good place if you enjoy Peruvian food as well. My friend got the Lomo Saltado and I got the Pollo with the orange sauce that I do not remember the name. I also got the Maracuya juice (asked not to be made with sugar and they were nice to do so) juice was not watery, it was really good. Food had awesome flavors and presentation. 
Aji seemed to be made with rocoto (aji, which translates to chili for those just used to that word) which was amazingly flavorful. 
The service was nice. 
Only thing I did not like too much was that the tables are a little too small, and I felt I had to arrange plate, sauce, glass and other items in a perfect way so I can eat comfortably. Also, difficult to park in the front and I am not sure if parking is allowed by the liquor store next door. 
Overall really good! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is small but busy with a friendly crowd for lunch today--all watching & cheering the World Cup (Spain vs Portugal). Don't miss out on the back parking lot off an alleyway if the front lot is full! I ordered a dish with beans, rice, red onions and beef. If was quite tasty and service was attentive. We also got a side of plantains for the table--delicious. I am not sure I ordered their best dish, so want to return again and try something else. I will say it is a welcoming Peruvian restaurant that draws its own--but friendly and a fun place to go with an authentic menu!"}
{"text":"Different and heavy food but flavorful. Small place but I love the friendly staff. I recommend this place if you want to step out of your element."}
{"text":"This is a small family run business. Everyone in the kitchen is related. The service was excellent, the atmosphere is great and the food was spectacular. Best Peruvian food we've had in AZ!! We sat at the bar and I enjoyed a great Argentinian red wine while my husband drank a Spanish lager. Both were delicious. After our meal the Owner stopped over to ask how it was. We talked for a long time and his wife came out from the kitchen to say hello as well. Super super sweet couple. We will definitely be back. This will be on the list of places we take visitors and I will be bringing customers from work as well."}
{"text":"Its a good sign when you feel explosively full after a meal and yet still wear a silly grin on your face.  Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon.  I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there.  Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed.

As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building.  This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store.  There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived).  There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance).  The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area.  When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background.  When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter.  

A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only.  It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend.  I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour.  Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites.  Wow, talk about refreshing.  There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion.  For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling).  Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce.  Holy moly was this awesome.  It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling.  I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?).  And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure.  If you're coming here for the first time, get this.  I'm making it mandatory.

After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me.  For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here.  I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds).  The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn).  Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus.  I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious.  All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning.  There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished.  Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor.  Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side.  I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen.  The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork.  An awesome, decadent conclusion. 

Absolutely incredible meal.  The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing.  They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit.  Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50.  Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to).  I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Usually Peruvian owners or cooks are Mexicans but this restaurant is family run by Peruvians! The dishes are very authentic and I love how they serve the food on the dishes. There is awesome Peruvian criollo music to set the mood. Overall fantastic and almost as great as my Peruvian mom's food"}
{"text":"Excellent service,jalea, tacutacu con lomo, chicha, and maracuya

Aji de gallina was good (maybe too much yellow paste)

Highly recommend.  Im peruvian :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came there last night and the small restaurant was packed. Who I believe was one of the owners/main chef greeted us and explained it might be a while before we could order because they were so busy. She was so warm and kind and so was everyone else. My friend and I had a pisco maracuya (passion fruit pisco) and they were delicious. We also split a causa rellena, a cold mashed potato cake with a chicken filling, and the lomo saltado, a dish with beef tenderloin and french fries and rice.  Everything was really delicious and seasoned so well but next time I will probably opt for less starch in one meal.  I rated this five stars because I really couldn't get over how wonderful the overall experience was to talk with the Peruvian chef and feel somewhat like I was with family :). Also, this woman recommended the ceviche because it's prepared unique to Peruvian culture and I will say it looked amazing at someone else's table."}
{"text":"This food is INCREDIBLE!! We got a very generous sized appetizer of Yuka frita with two delicious sauces. I ordered chicken saltado per a recommendation from the server and was blown away. It was bursting with flavor...a wonderful combination of onions, tomatoes, potatoes, and chicken in a mouth-watering vinegar/pepper sauce. I couldn't get enough! The Arroz con Pollo was very large and full of flavor! We cannot wait to go back!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"First of all - very cool 'hole in the wall' kind of vibe. 
We walked in and were seated at one of the two remaining tables...good sign

We started by splitting a 'choose three' appetizer platter.
We got the Papa Rellena, Yuca Frita, and I don't remember the name of the third.
The Papa Rellena was really good - tasted kind of like a tamale, but better - and served with some pickled onions, I think?  Really tasty - this was the best.  The Yuca Frita was good.  The  other one was about a 4\" diameter cylindrical shaped item about 1 1/2\" tall.  It had chicken in it - I thought it tasted like deviled eggs - it was also very good, but we had to save room for the main course.  My wife ordered the Ceviche - it was very good - had a lot of zing to it.  Everybody else ordered the Lomo Saltado.  It was also really good.

Our server was friendly and attentive as well.

Very nice place to go and get your Peruvian gnosh on."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Peruvian cuisine.  Not knowing what to order, I went with the Arroz con Pollo, since it's your basic Latin dish.  I was immediately hit with the flavor of the rice.  It's as if they mixed delicious chimichuri sauce with white rice.  The dark meat of the chicken was juicy and the skin was crisp.  The onion garnish on the side even had amazing tangy flavor I've never had before.  El Chullo took a basic dish and nailed it.

On my second trip, I wanted to explore the menu so I went with the Escabeche de Pollo.  That dish has become one of the best things I have ever tried.  The sauce is the star of the dish with its amazing savory flavor.  It magnified the juicy dark meat of the chicken.  The dish also came with a pyramid of white rice, a couple of nicely crisped slices of sweet potatoes that paired nicely with the escabeche sauce, and those tangy onions I have come to love.

Third trip, I had the Lomo Saltado.  It's basically like loaded fries.  Not bad.  

Appetizers, oh my.  The Papa Rellena is amazing.  It's a ball of mash potato that is filled with meat, hard egg, olives, and raisins.  The outside of the potato ball is fried shut so it holds it's shape.  Don't let the raisins stop you from trying it, it's not overpowering. 

Try this place"}
{"text":"Ohh yeah, so happy there's Peruvian in phx.. I like this and the Peruvian joint on alma school and ray road equally.. I could eat their lomo saltado every day.. the chicken with the red sauce is also awesome. Do yourself a flavor"}
{"text":"Unique flavors. The green pesto on fettacinni was awesome.  The green rice with Pollo outstanding. Traditional state drink sharp alive and delicious.  Will be returning to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Parking in the back.
Seated right away.
Dinner time gets busy.

Many cultures have their own take rice and chicken, and I will say that the Peruvian version is one that I enjoyed. The arroz con pollo was uplifting with it's cilantro and spices. The place inside is clean and nice. It may look like it's a hole in the wall on the outside, but very renovated on the inside. 

Good service.

Would come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food with poor service. While bringing our pisco to the table, one of the waiters questioned the validity of my friend's Arizona driver's license (she is 26 years old). She said condescendingly \"Hmm I don't know if this is real because I don't want minors drinking here, but I'll give the drink to you this time\". She then proceeded to comment on how young I appear as well, even though I didn't order a drink (surprise, I'm also 26!). On top of that, the bottom of my friend's drink literally fell out of the glass while she was drinking. Her food, shirt, and belongings were covered in pisco sour. Instead of uttering a single word of apology, the same waiter commented on how \"this happens all the time\". Incredulous, I asked her if the bottoms of glasses commonly fall out in this restaurant. She responded \"oh no, I just assumed that she dropped it, the glass falling out has never happened before\". Needless to say, the food is good, but the waiter's patronizing behavior was unwelcome and reflects poorly on the potential of this restaurant. Will not be returning because of that reason. Tips to other young-appearing people who want to try this restaurant: Bring your passport if you want drinks!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant small and cozy. Parking is tough but food makes up for it. Staff was extremely courteous and friendly with outstanding service. I had the Lomo Saltado and an Alfajor. It was my first time having Lomo saltado and it was delicious. The alfajor was one of the best I have ever had. Prices were higher than previous reviews suggested so I have uploaded updated menu photos. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped in based on the review when we walked in there was three tables open two square 4 seat and one two seat however the two seat is all alone right in the middle of the room  yuck  so I ask the lady if we could sit at one of the square 4 seats open and she said no  only the bar or the terrible two seater  sadly that's the first time I've ever walked out when I saw such a good review  couples will have a hard time enjoying this kind of poor customer service  in fact I probably would've bought enough food for four  well their loss we found a very romantic place only a half mile from there"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a \"must\" for any lover of Latin A,Erica's cuisine.  I had the Frijoles con Seco a la Nortena (stewed beef with rice and beans) all I can say is \"wow\"! The beef was super tender and the dish had a great range of flavors and seasonings, very well prepared. It was enough to share if you also get an appetizer, as are some of the other dishes. Service was quick and pleasant, definitely a return visit on the agenda, although I'll make sure to share so that we can try the deserts too!"}
{"text":"Legit Peruvian in Phoenix!  Ceviche came as white hot as can be found in Lima.  Anticuchos de corazon were prepared correctly.  My only complaints: very little parking and no Peruvian beer to wash down the food.  Did I mention that actual Peruvians eat here?  That has got to count for something."}
{"text":"Peruvian cuisine seems to be based on chicken and potatoes- fine with me. El Chullo is a New Times Award winning place on 7th Street north of Virginia. Can't remember the names of what I ordered but the appetizer was a thin sliced marinated fried potato. You eat them like potato chips but they are not dry and slightly crispy. The entrée was a chicken breast, pan fried in a red pepper vinegar sauce with red onion slices. Very good! There was a small side of potatoes and a rather large pyramid of white rice. I love rice but I prefer it flavored. I almost asked for more red pepper vinegar sauce for the rice. It was similar to Japanese sticky rice. The place was small, clean, nice artwork on the walls, flat screen tv with Fox Spanish channel showing a soccer game. They have a full bar so we ordered a carafe of Sangria- iced, filled with what appeared to be fruit cocktail- very good and pared well with the meal. We ate the wine soaked fruit like a dessert. El Chullo has an air of authenticity about it and I most likely will go back in the future."}
{"text":"Incredible tallarín con mariscos (spaghetti with seafood). I had not seen this preparation before and as a Peruvian and a foodie I have an abundant amount of experience in Peruvian cuisine! The flavor was incredible, bursting with flavor! A bit of Rocoto to add a nice touch of spiciness. I had to order a side a rice so I could absorb all of the fabulous juice. My wife had a sampler platter with Papa a la Huancaina, papa rellena and causa! She raved about each of them. She also had an Afajor for dessert and it was wonderful! The owners are a family, each contributing to the success of the restaurant! Pricing is competitive. We went this evening  and had to wait about 15 minutes as we apparently are not the only ones who know about this wonderful little restaurant! The restaurant is small but as they continue to build a clientele, this place is certain to grow and be even more successful!"}
{"text":"This place was great. My family and I enjoyed the delicious Peruvian food they offered. The only complaint I have is that the place is too
Small and the deserts are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I am from Peru and came to Arizona for vacation and I was surprised to find an amazing restaurant. I tried many Peruvian restaurant and let me tell you this one the best Peruvian food I ever tasted. Ceviche is amazing and customer service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!!  Authentic!!!  Restaurant seems to be worked by the family that owns it. The sons who basically does everything except cook, is very personable and has great people skills. His mother is sweet but does not speak English. If you go when it is busy be prepared to wait. What they need to do is designate each one in the family a duty. Son waits tables, mother gets waters and canchitas, father clears and sets tables and helps with bringing out food. Anyways if you have time it is definitely worth the wait. We will go back for sure!!  Oh and the pisco sours are awesome!! Along with the anticuchos and aji de gallina. Yum"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good...so good I can't wait to go back there again.  The parking is very limited, so be prepared to park in the neighborhood and walk.  Trust me, you'll forget all about the parking situation once you try their food.  

We shared a causa rellena to start and it was surprisingly fresh and flavorful.  For my entree, I selected the lomo saltado based on our server's recommendation and man, was he right - this dish is over the top good!

If you have not yet tried El Chullo, get in there and give it a try...don't let the exterior of the restaurant discourage you from trying this gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The wife and I had been wanting some Peruvian food, so we decided to go to El Chullo based on all of the other Yelp reviews.  Once again, Yelp does not lie!  Everything that we ordered was delicious!  The food was so flavorful and we enjoyed every bite that we ate.  We will definitely be back as there are so many other tasty options that we would like to try!"}
{"text":"Went on a whim.  The drinks were tasty.  Enjoyed my dish as well as my companions.  I would like some more spice to it.  I have been to Peru and the food is divine.  Well priced  and clean as well as a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Now I know what it feels like to be discriminated against! If you're Peruvian, you good to go. Otherwise, do not enter! We were sat at a tiny little table in the middle of the restaurant that was smokey. We waited 10 minutes and never even offered glass of water!"}
{"text":"My husband and I saw the reviews on this place we are from California visting here for the weekend so we decided to give it a try the food was delicious  The service was ok our waitress disappeared for a while I was thirsty and my 2 year old wanted water I asked another waitress for a cup of water and she did but wasnt to kind like if it bothered her she was extra kind with everyone else plus my water had some green stuff in it"}
{"text":"My new favorite Peruvian restaurant. I had the tallarines verdes with the bistek on the side (for my carnivorous husband) because I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating and did not seem to judge me for doing that (which most places do). The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water.

It's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. I have NOTHING to rave about at all. :( I'm a big fan of Peruvian food and this place just didn't do it for me. I had the Jalea,
Cebiche, arroz chaufa, and lomo saltado."}
{"text":"Best most authentic Peruvian food in town! Ceviche is off the chain! Food does take a while but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Peruvian food here in the valley. I'm surprised that there actually are so many to choose from. Out of all of them, I believe that El Chullo has the best food of them all. I've had their ceviche, lomo saltado, and jalea. All of which were excellent. I would give it 5 stars if ratings were based only on the food! Not only does it taste great, it even is presented beautifully.

Now, what brings this place down is the location. My biggest gripe is the A/C seems to not always be running cool. Not to mention it isn't the nicest looking of restaurants. For the price I expect a bit more class. Not super fancy, just a touch more.

And yes, it's central Phoenix. So parking is tight."}
{"text":"El Chullo is an authentic eatery staffed and operated by natives, and frequented by those seeking to indulge in true homemade Peruvian deliscousness.

My wife and I took our three kids and a cousin visiting from Venezuela. The adults had a carafe of white sangria and the kids had a Peruvian staple, chicha.

We had the appetizer platter, and chose fried yuca, causa rellena, and a Peruvian tamal. We ate every last ounce of food and sauce!

For our entrees, the kids had the tallarin and salchipapas, and the adults had ceviche and the mixed seafood platter. The ceviche was some of the best Peruvian ceviche we've had. The seafood platter was made up of deep fried fish, shrimp, calamari, and oysters. It was served with boiled potatoes and fried yuca.

Everything was great, and the service was awesome. The seafood platter was a little over cooked, but then again it's deep fried so what can you expect. We will definitely come back and bring our Peruvian neighbors to enjoy tasty authentic food they don't have to prepare themselves. :-)"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with great staff, excellent food, and wonderful pisco.

We discovered this gem recently and it is going to be a staple in our eating route. I would recommend this place wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"Exquisite, finger licking good Peruvian food!

The best Peruvian food I've ever had outside of Peru. Great cozy ambiance, friendly staff, and good service. The food brought up memories of my grandmother's restaurant in Ilo, Perú."}
{"text":"This is a very small Peruvian Restaurant with a bar. They serve mostly Peruvian Food thats heavy with rice and lots of potatoes. They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture. 

I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home.

My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion.

The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet.

Service was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"When my friend texted me to see if I want to go have Peruvian food at El Chullo, I was very excited. As adventurous as my palate is, I had never been to this local gem. LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The ambiance, the people, the fact that a mother and father along with their two sons run this place was a huge plus for me. Along with their Momma, the sons are the chefs creating some of their own along with recipes handed down by their ancestors. The flavors are incredible. I can't wait to take the family back. Another fabulous local go to place for me... Woohoo!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We got the cause rellena with chicken, ceviche and Lomo Saltado. The cause rellena was creamy and delicious. The Lomo Saltado was the best one I've ever had, the sauce is so goooood and the meat very tender. This was my first time here but I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place, my favorite cuisine first of all is peruvian, and I am so happy to say that El Chullo has become my favorite peruvian restaurant (thus far in my culinary journey). The ceviche here is perfectly spiced, the texture of the fish is great, and the sweet potatoes and the canchas (salted corn nuts) offset the spiciness, wow just typing this review makes my mouth water. I literally cannot wait to go back for more! The entree size of the ceviche isn't enough if you are starved, but its a perfect portion for someone who isn't too hungry. My boyfriend and I ordered one ceviche each and then we also ordered a lomo saltado to share. The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes. Order this if you are a steak and potatoes type of person. For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side. 

To be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner. 
 
All in all it was a great time and a great meal! I can't wait to go back.. perhaps I'll stop in for lunch and or dinner tonight because honestly I just can't get enough."}
{"text":"Ceviche and Anticuchos are outstanding! The Maracuya sour or Passionfruit pisco is so delicious and refreshing. Excellent service. Highly recommend El Chullo"}
{"text":"Arroz con pollo was good as well as the purple corn drink. Sorry dont remember the name of it  service was great. It wasnt too busy so may be the reason why others have given bad reviews. But overall pleasant experience with good food"}
{"text":"Best Peruvian Food! I recommend everyone to stop by and try it out.  Best sea food i have tasted for a long time."}
{"text":"I really want this place to be good.  I spoke at great length with the owner and I truly feel that this family has the best of intentions.  It's heartwarming to hear about a family putting their son through college to become a chef.  I've been here twice and can tell you that I won't be back unless significant changes happen.

It all started off wrong.  My girlfriend and I walked in to see a mostly empty restaurant.  There was a large table with 13 seats that had a party of about 6 sitting and eating.  We told the hostess that there were only 2 of us, and she seemed annoyed.  She asked if we had reservations, which we didn't and her response was, \"well I don't think we have any availability.\"  Odd seeing how the place was mostly empty.  Luckily, a couple was just leaving the bar and we were able to grab a seat.  

For being a Peruvian restaurant, they don't have a single Peruvian beer available.

The food is okay, but the rice wasn't cooked enough and was crunchy.  The ceviche was perfect and had the perfect amount of spice.  The leche de tigre was delicious.  

I asked for a glass of water and was given one fast enough.  However, while sipping I noticed a sharpness on my lips.  When I examined my cup, I noticed a large chip missing from the edge of my glass.  I notified the waitress and she was barely interested.  Not enough to replace it immediately.  Odd seeing how this is a HUGE health risk.  Chips like this are caused by laziness in the wait staff who scoop ice from the ice bin using their customers glass.  Guess what?  That chip is now somewhere in the ice bin.  The entire rest of the night, I couldn't help but think of someone swallowing shards of glass.  

 While sitting at the bar, I couldn't focus on anything other than the activity in the kitchen: the entire wait staff and cook staff were horsing around playing.  It wasn't a single instance I saw, it was for the entire duration of my meal.  It was incredibly unprofessional and distracting.  Maybe the cook was too busy playing grab ass with his friends to cook rice acceptably.  

I truly hope the owner sees this review and cleans house.  The girls behind the the bar are inattentive and don't care about the heritage of the food they're serving.  Moreover, the owners son needs to get serious about his trade.  El Chullo really has an opportunity to clinch the Peruvian food market in all of Phoenix.  For now, I'll be going to Villa Peru"}
{"text":"Lovely experience! Small but cozy place, the staff was attentive and food was served in a timely manner. I had the maracuya sour beverage which seemed to me like pisco sour with a tart passion fruit flavor: LOVED IT! I dined upon the causa relleno with crab appetizer and it was quite tasty. It is almost like a mashed potato disc-cake with a layer of crab in between. I also enjoyed the seafood ceviche, though I prefer to call it by its real name which is la Leche de Tigre. A good amount of spice and heat in the almost milky colored sauce, the Peruvians certainly know how to prepare lime saturated seafood! Definitely will return and eat everything on this menu."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Peruvian cuisine. The lomo saltado was the best I've ever had, and the alfajor dessert is a must. The staff was so friendly and helpful as well. Highly recommend to anyone looking for some great Peruvian food!"}
{"text":"El Chullo. When I saw on Yelp that this place was awesome, and I was in town, I definitely had to check it out. I've had Peruvian before, and this was a little something different. I know that there were a lot of Chinese influence on Peruvian food, sot his was exciting to check out what Phoenix had. Let's just say, I never had Peruvian like this. We ordered some different type of food so it was nice to the different options.

For the appetizers, we ordered the appetizer platter which we got the chance to try out three different types of apps. We ordered the Beef heart the Stuffed potato, and the frite. The beef heart and the stuffed potatoes were amazing. I would definitely recommend those if you're choosing between the two. The beef heart isn't as bad as you think it would be, the meat was quite tender and had a good amount of flavor. The frites were alright, there was actually nothing special to it. 

For the Entrée, I ordered the Frijol con seco a la nortena. It was pretty good, and it really was sort of leaning on just a beef stew. It came with beans, but the stew was well balanced and had a good amount of flavor. My first choice for entrée they ran out and so I had to settle on this as it was something that caught my eye. Anyways, it's pretty normal, but it hits the spot.

Now, as far as the interior décor, that's something new. It's a little hole in the wall spot. It's something that you won't be used to, but then again a lot of places that I had experience in Phoenix was pretty much hole in the wall. This place is definitely legit though, with the nice soap operas on tv and and everything so simplistic.

Definitely, this place is somewhere you need to check out if you're wanting to try something out that's not Mexican and something new."}
{"text":"Small Peruvian place with a small parking lot. Service was good. The server had good recommendation. The food took a little too long to come out. The Tigre de Legre (the sauce of the ceviche) was very good! There was a lot of squid instead of fish in the ceviche mixto. The lomo saltado rice was just okay. Meat could've been better."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best food I've had. I took my family here and talked this place up and they loved it too! The service is great and I enjoy the relaxed feel inside. I just wish it was closer to my house in N. Phoenix. We'll still be traveling to eat here!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this hidden Peruvian Cafe many times and never noticed it until tonight. Truly a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but a nice cozy restaurant in the inside. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Yuca Fritas appetizer and Mariscos con Arroz entreé. I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entreé. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot."}
{"text":"This place is small but the food is mighty.  Mighty good that is.   This dishes are expertly prepared and the cook makes different sauces every week.   Even the juices are fresh and the service is great.   Will definitely return again for another round."}
{"text":"My friend and I had never tasted Peruvian food before and if this is any indication of the quality and type of food to expect, I'll never eat anything but Peruvian again. The ceviche mixto was tender and spicy. We spooned up and drank the delicious ceviche liquid afterwards - don't judge until you taste it yourself. The causa rellena del pollo was unexpectedly light but savory and that mysterious yellow sauce is a triumph. Finally, the desserts - the Alfajor and Crema Volteada. Think crumbly dulce de leche-filled cookies and dense, creamy flan with caramel sauce. In addition, our waitress was near-clairvoyant and simply straight-up amazing. Come here and eat all the things. And enjoy a traditional pisco sour while you're at it."}
{"text":"Yum!  The food is authentic and one of the best Peruvian restaurants that I've eaten in.

The service was great. I was the only one in my party that had eaten Peruvian food before and everyone else had a lot of questions. The waitress was so nice and patient. She obviously took a lot of pride in the food they serve, particularly their more traditional food and drinks.

This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Just like mamma makes! Thank you, Omar! We loved the food and the amazing service! 
We'll be back!!! 
The Lomo Saltado was just like home!"}
{"text":"Omg... hands down the best Peruvian restaurant in Arizona!!! Yum... and I know, my wife is Peruvian ;)"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while in Phoenix and decided to to try it out as My husband and I love Peruvian food. Waited outside for 40 mins for opening time and there was a rush of people who entered together. My husband and I were the first to get it..... We seated ourselves and then noticed the servers attended 4 other tables before us.......small establishment so not a lot of tables and service was very slow.

Finally got attended to and the food took an hour to come out. Highly salted and my husband lost his appetite after the long wait. 

The server was nice and apologized but I'm still giving one star because I can't understand how this establishment got such a high rating."}
{"text":"My roommate is Peruvian and he loves the food here, and he says it's authentic. I've traveled to Peru with him and the Lomo Saltado here tastes the same as in Peru and it's delicious!! 

Staff is super nice, food is great. It's quiet and nicely kept dining area. Great find!"}
{"text":"Oh so good. We met family and there are only a few tables so make a reservation if it's the weekend. The wait was 45 min and there is a tiny bar with 5 chairs you can wait with a  cocktail if there's space. We all had ceviche mixto which was amazing. My daughter had the spaghetti with meat sauce which I tasted and it was off the charts good. The cocktails are pricey, but good. There is limited parking out front , but later we realized there is back parking with a door you can enter. We definitely be headed back there when we are in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Un día pasando de pruebas y terminamos en El Chullo. Comida Peruana. Un ambiente agradable, muy familia, atención buena y comida sabrosa.
Pedí un saltado y unas papá a la huancaina. Las papas estaban muy sabrosas, el saltado bueno. Creo que vale la pena repetir."}
{"text":"YUM-o! This is a super small spot. Just about 10 or 12 tables. The service is LOVELY and every single item I've tasted has been delicious!

There's a tight strip of parking in front, and a small lot in back (turn west into the alley off of Virginia).

On my first visit, we followed our server's recommendation and indulged with the appetizer sampler and the portions were HUGE. Then, we tacked on two entrees and wound up leaving with leftovers and no room for dessert!

One of the entrees was the arroz chaufa con marisocs - a savory seafood fried rice rich in flavor.

On my most recent visit, I had the lomo saltado. I know it's a traditional Peruvian dish... my GOODNESS: the tender, tasty marinated beef! Served on a bed of french fries with a side of rice? A carb-lover's dream! It's like an asian-inspired poutine.

Picking a favorite is hard!

I also recommend the traditional Pisco Sour cocktail - a frothy, tart but sweet concoction with Peruvian brandy (called pisco) as the base.

(NOTE: most of these dishes contain gluten; the staff is great about checking and will give an honest answer)"}
{"text":"This place was very hyped to me from a Peruvian friend. I informed the server this was my first time having Peruvian food so she made recommendations and selected a dish from her recommendations. I ordered a mixed fried seafood entree (Jalea Mixta). The calamari was over cooked and chewy which was not a big deal. The huge problem was the excessive amount of salt the entree contained. The meal was not enjoyable. The silver lining to this was the green chicken soup I ordered my daughter. She seemed to enjoy it very much. The plantains were the highlight of the night and ideally cooked. My wife enjoyed her lomo saltado. I do not think I will be visiting this establishment again as I was highly disappointed. Maybe I ordered the worst dish they had?"}
{"text":"Great food.  And my mom loves it!  Nice to see someone doing different food and doing it well.  I recommend everyone give them a try."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Peruvian food...it was amazing. The restaurant is very intimate, and very nicely decorated. We went around 530pm on a Thursday and it didn't start getting really busy until around 630pm. The food was absolutely delicious, I had the arroz con pollo with chicken. The way they plated the food and the way it was arranged on the plate was visually stunning. The taste was amazing, I could not finish it all because the portions were so big. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in Phoenix, or anyone who is looking for a new food to try."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Restless Heart - When She Cries)

The place I have traveled in
Is Yelped with good reviews
It's littered with several stars
That only quite came true

When all of my peers were drinking
Her food kept me trying
She does her best to cook
The meal that Bo Bites been through

El Chullo's tonight
And I really think that I should taste it
It can't hide
All the meals they make inside

El Chullo serves up some authentic Peruvian style food!

I just got back from Peru and unfortunately they don't serve Cuy! Now that would be authentic! In any case, my foodie friends and I ordered individually but different dishes. I went with the Tallarin Saltado, a spaghetti like dish with beef. Overall, it was pretty solid. Salty and just a tad bit of spice, with the crunch of the raw onions giving this dish a savory bite!

However, my 2 favorites of the night were the beef heart and the fried rice! Beef heart anyone!? Yeah, it came a super spicy sauce you can add and when I say be careful.....BE CAREFUL! Youch! Spicy indeed, but the heart was so tender....uh yummy! The fried rice...I thought my mama made good fried rice; sorry mom! Overall, one of the best bite of fried rice I had in a while. It was a blend of Peruvian and Chinese style so I totally appreciate the fusion and so will you!

The service was spot on with our large group plus no mix up with our checks, which is totally awesome. The place is very tiny so be sure to make your reservations! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food here is great. Flavors and food presentation is impressive. Ask for what is a best dish and you will be happy. Small interior but surly a must try place."}
{"text":"I'm the beginning service was great . I go to Peruvian places in California and this place was very much different. With that being I said I ordered my favorite shrimp chowder soup it taste nothing like the Peruvian food back home . My dad makes better shrimp chowder . They put peas and carrots . Gross. The menu says veggies , yes I probably should have asked what veggies but I didn't . I hate peas and I told the waiter if I could get something new I don't like peas . She argued with me and said it says on the menu it has peas then says well no it doesn't it says veggies . After I conversation she come back and says they will make you a new one with no peas. I didn't want a new one I just wanted something else but guess she ignored that . Any other professional restraunt satisfies the customer apologizes and takes the dish off the check and asks if there is anything they can do to compliment the customer . Anyways, I took my left overs for lunch today guess what I found a pea . They didn't make me a new bowl they sat there and took the peas out . I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"We were excited to find a Peruvian restaurant with vegetarian options, so decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it is family run. They were extremely warm and hospitable and the food was freshly prepared home style! Even the piscos were thoughtfully made :) We enjoyed our evening and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall exterior. Parking lot is super small. Don't let that discourage though!! The food is worth it! Our First time here we found the quality of the food rivals Peruvian restaurants in Sonoma and New York. The recipes are spot on. Even the seafood was great. Will definitely be back again and again. No lunch menu so be prepared to share or go home with leftovers."}
{"text":"I love the lomo saltado. Meat was very tender and the sauce was on point. Service was great. The place is a little small and the place tends to get busy.(That's what she said). If you're on the fence about trying out this nice little quaint restaurant, jump off the fence and walk on in. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"In AZ and not sure what to eat? want something flavorful and definitely worth every penny? El Chullo is your spot! go here and you totally won't regret it one bit!!!! 

ordered:
*Lomo Saltado-YUM! flavorful. one of their most popular items at el chullo. i definitely didn't want to stop eating this! everything was very well seasoned and the beef strips were cooked perfectly. the tomatoes were very flavorful as well! 
*arroz con pollo- this was recommended to me by the staff. which i thought was pretty good. the rice was flavorful and the sauce that came with it was very unique. for my first time having arroz con pollo i was definitely left with a good impression and would definitely try to order this at other peruvian places. 

overall, staff is really nice. the bittersweet part about coming here is you're hungry you gotta wait quite awhile for your food because they make it fresh. it's like i like the idea of it being made fresh but the wait is long for the food. also they don't have the spicy dipping sauce i've had at other Peruvian food places that you eat with bread. they however give you these unpopped popcorn kernel thing that is lightly salted. personally i didn't care for it.  

tips:
*small front of store parking lot.
*cash and credit cards accepted
*they post a lot of their food on instagram
*serves alcohol.
*they have a few TVs.
*indoor seating only. 
*not super ideal for large parties since it's a small little mom and pops place."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I had and we only entered for a second with two kids and three adults and were told they only take reservations of parties of four and more. The girl proceeded to tell us that it would be a 30min but more likely an hour wait when there were two tables of four opened. I pointed that out that we would squeeze into one of the four tops and she said they were reserved. It was very apparent that we were not welcomed. They also seemed under staffed. I wanted to bring my small family to taste the food since I had come to this place before and enjoyed their food. Needles to say we will never be coming back."}
{"text":"El Chullo is one of the few authentic Peruvian food locales in Phoenix and luckily for us, is absolutely delicious!  The lomo saltado is a must, especially if this is your first experience with Peruvian food.  But, you can't go wrong with the fish ceviche - the best I've ever tasted.  The Chicha morada (purple corn drink) was also interesting and delicious.  To top it off, the service was great.  We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Come eat here! Food is amazing. Don't be fooled
... The place doesn't look like much, but everything we've had so far is great!

I wanted to bathe in the escabice sauce."}
{"text":"The lomo saltado, signature Peruvian dish, was quite disappointing. The papas a la huancaina was disappointing as well - I guess the sauce was fine but needed more of the expected Peruvian \"kick\" aka yellow chili. Finally, the chupe de camarones soup tasted good but only had 5 regular size shrimp and 1 jumbo shrimp in it - seriously I counted - so it was not worth the price :(

I was so excited to try a Peruvian place in PHX but maybe because I was expecting to much I felt the place wasn't very good and would probably not go back."}
{"text":"Drove 45 ... Well worth it .. The Ceviche Mixto is to die for. Everything was great, from the presentation, portion, texture, flavor and spices .. Just Perfect !
Super Friendly staff, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable about their dishes, def coming back next time I'm in AZ !"}
{"text":"Great food staff was very nice for our large group. The kitchen could not handle the amount of people food came out at different times. It  was my first time at a Peruvian Restaurant enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"I am a big supporter of family owned business so I decided to stop by and see what all the fuss is about. I have never had peruvian food before so I can't really compare my experience to another peruvian restaurant. 

The lot is small and it's kind of hard to park.  The service is good.  The server was really friendly and he tried to give us recommendations.  I ordered the Lomo Saltado and it was flavorful, but I didn't see the difference between that and the nacho fries that you get at Filibertos for half the price. Now, don't get me wrong.  It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert. I didn't even end up with a doggie bag for the price we paid. I didn't expect to pay as much as what we had paid, but I know they have to pay their bills.  It's a  business.  I get it. 

I just don't know if I would justify the price and value of the food to come back.  If you have never had peruvian food, come on over though and try it. At least once."}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere was nice. The waitress was very helpful. Love the ceviche. Anticuchos were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere was nice. The waitress was very helpful. Prices are exactly what you should pay. Very easy to get there and find the restaurant. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!! Our waiter recommended some dishes for us since it was our first time and they were perfect!!"}
{"text":"Bf and I have never had Peruvian food before. We're in Phoenix for a conference, and while here we went to visit my uncle, who's from Peru. Bf got in the mood to try out Peruvian food, and even though this place was closed the night we saw my uncle, we decided to try this place out anyway because of the Yelp reviews. I got the Arroz Chaufa- very good and enough for two with a Maracuya Sour. Bf got the Lomo Saltado with the chef's suggestion of an added egg (very helpful), which he loved. We shared a Yuca Frita, which was really good, and they were super nice and made a sauce without onions so I could eat it (allergic to onions). If we ever come this way again, we'll be sure to come back. And for all of you who live in Phoenix, definitely take the opportunity to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Let's start by getting the 4 stars out of the way.  The place was HOT, like really hot, like maybe no AC hot.  This made for a slightly uncomfortable setting.  Besides the temperature, I loved the place.  Seemed like a mom and pop shop which I always like.  So lets change it up and  talk food.  Wow....  It was tasty!  Got the Papa a La Huancaina for an appetizer and it was amazing.  I was disappointed at first because it looked so plain, just boiled potatoes cut in half smothered in a sauce.  However, after that first bite I was hooked.  These were amazing.  Got a couple of their drinks, and they were pretty tasty as well, however I wouldn't get those again.  My wife got Tallarines Verdes and it was amazing.  The pasta was a great pesto green color, which had initially concerned me it would have too strong of a pesto flavor.  It did not.  The pasta was actually nice and creamy with a perfect amount of flavor.  I got the Ceviche Mixto.  This was outstanding.  The assortment of seafood was great, the presentation was pretty, and the sauce was amazing.  Packed full of a nice lime-kick with some spice.  The waiter talked me out of going 'spicy' and went for 'medium' instead, which was probably a good idea.  Medium had a nice amount of spice that built up, but was never too spicy to ruin or mask flavors.  I would love to go back and try some other options the food was very good."}
{"text":"We ended up in this restaurant with a search in yelp. This is a great place overall: customer service, cleanliness, nice environment.
The food is fresh and the portions are huge! My mom and I will be sharing next time; had a lot of left overs.
I really want to go back to have some pisco sour :)
Parking is hard as the store is facing 7th st and there are only 5 to 6 spots in the front; so park in the back and come in. 
Main cross roads are 7th st and McDowell. Head north on 7th street and it will be in the corner of Virginia - NE corner."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband, who is Peruvian, felt this was authentic. Only downside would've been that they were understaffed. It's not a big place, but once it filled up, the one waitress was running. Also, parking is limited, which is typical for DT Phoenix. Highly recommend trying at least once. Our favorites were: Lomo saltado (beef with French fries and gravy-like sauce), papa rellena (stuffed potato), tallarin saltado con carne (tenderloin with spaghetti) and of course pisco sours!"}
{"text":"Excellent,  what else can I say. A little piece of Peru in the heart of Phoenix.  Love it."}
{"text":"Delicious! But be careful of the Peruvian liquor- it kicked my butt! Great fish stew, great service! Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"First time! Really enjoyed our dinner here. Good, authentic Peruvian food. Good service. Only issue is that it tends to be a bit loud. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary food and service.  Presentation is mouthwatering. Really fond of the appetizers and desserts."}
{"text":"The alfajores rock! My one single favorite thing from this place. Peruvian food is not my favorite, cannot comment on the food."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful food. Nothing beats the lomo saltado! Big portions and great cocktails."}
{"text":"I lived in Peru for three years and this is the best Peruvian food I have had in America. Love it. Thank you for taking me on a wonderful trip down memory lane!"}
{"text":"The food is good the service is not. It took 30 minutes for the soup to arrive and another 20 minutes for the dinner to be on the table. Plus the chicken breast I ordered was so thick in suspicious way pushing me to think where do they buy their ingredients from!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely legit. Came here for our Early Valentines Dinner on Friday night. The owner and Chef and family are cool and nice. Chef Omar brings out your food to your table. I had a beef pasta (forget the actual peruvian name for it) but it was super tasty and so good. Also, the ceviche is just so much fun to eat and look at. Very tasty and colorful and flavorful. Only downside, my BF made reservations and when we got there one of the sisters at the front foor said we couldn't be seated because they had a big party at 8pm. However we had reservations...in which she had written our name down and finally we got sat."}
{"text":"Great service, great apps, great entree, great fruit juice, great dessert. It's so small that is you drive too quickly, you'll miss it. Don't be fooled by the look or location - this place is stellar."}
{"text":"The food and service here was excellent. The portion sizes were very large. Everything was extremely flavorful. Dessert was wonderful too. The prices were reasonable. I can't wait until the bar opens there. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and seasoning was great.  Portions were large so we would consider splitting a meal in the future. Yucca appetizer was very good. Small kitchen so will take a bit of time to get your meals. Seats about 25 so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I have never Peruvian food in the United States that tasted as if you were in Lima, Peru. The gastronomy of this country is amazing, I always enjoy the food whenever I have visited the country. This restaurant was amazing. My sister and I went out to eat and I found it on Yelp. My food was excellent! Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small, but clean, Good food, and exceptional service. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My God, the flavors of the food were absolutey spectacular. Everything was AMAZING, and we tried more than a few plates. Love, love, love. Will definitely be coming back. I took off one star for service. When we got there it took a long time for anyone to even offer water, and we were extremely thirsty from the heat. When we were ordering I asked for an explanation about the food preparation and the waitress seemed annoyed that I couldn't understand the word in Spanish she was using and she just kept repeating it when I kept asking for a different explanation. The food took a while to come out. I will definitely come back though! The food is just so good!"}
{"text":"We had to drop my sister off at the airport and wanted to try something new so I launched my Yelp to see what I had bookmarked nearby and saw this. Neither my mom nor I had ever tried Peruvian food so we thought we would give this place a try. It's right on 7th street so parking in front of the small restaurant (7 tables and a few chairs at a small bar) is very limited, so if you miss it, just turn right on the first street and then take a right into the alley and park in the small lot behind the restaurant. You can also enter through doors on the back or walk around to the front.  We shared an appetizer and each got a meal and drink waters and our total bill was approximately $36.  We loved everything. I can't remember the names for each, but I'll post pics!"}
{"text":"First tip-Parking lot in the back through an alley. Easier than the front. 
My friend and I came here to check it out and overall, we loved it. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got one on one personal treatment with the chef so we learned a lot. 
Not to sound like a broken record but the ceviche is soooo good. I love the flavors. The ceviche is just the fish marinated and the ceviche mixto is fish, squid, mussels, and clams.  I think the ceviche of just fish is the better of the two. It just holds the flavor better.  And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy.  So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix.  I can only imagine how spicy hot is.  Been here three times and I still crave it. 
Ok, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been.
The causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food. 
If you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes. 
Good lomo saltado according to bf. I do like that the fries are crispy and skinny. 
The kicker is that if you go now, they finally have air conditioning!!!  It was getting to be a bit difficult going during the summer so I can only imagine how the workers felt. 
Warning though, if you are from California and used to Peruvian food there, they don't carry the green aji sauce that we know and love.  Apparently that's only a CA creation since we're so used to jalapeños.
This is a must place. From the wait staff to the food, everything is too notch."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great flavor.  The Ceviche was a medium and this German girl thought it was hot.  But the seafood was amazing!  The Beef Tenderloin was juicy and tender.  The oce cream was unique and fabulous and the cookie melts in yoir mouth.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We will definitely return to find new favorites."}
{"text":"We went during their breakfast menu hours (10-12). Their menu consisted of sharable dishes for 2. They were able to flex and cater to my girlfriend's dietary restrictions, and the food still came out very delicious and perfectly seasoned. Would definitely recommend for a breakfast date."}
{"text":"Dear El Chullo, you have just earned a huge piece of my eating out budget. Wow. From a Cuban girl, who is super picky about her Hispanic foods... the Shrimp Chupe... the best I've ever had....the Lomo salteado, what a wonderful guilty pleasure and yucca fries! I'm in food heaven. Thank you"}
{"text":"Authentic Peruvian food. The whole family (mom, dad and sons ) cook at the restaurant. Best dishes to order are lomo saltado and ceviche mixto. The potatoes with huancaina sauce and the yuca frita are amazing appetizers."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the appearance of the outside of the restaurant deter you from experiencing truly great Peruvian food. The appetizer sampler is a great start. My wife and I especially enjoyed the seafood and of course the potato dishes. The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful. If you have never tried Peruvian food then this would be a great place to have your first experience."}
{"text":"My favorite Peruvian restaurant in AZ! Peruvian food is probably the best in the world imo and this place sure does demonstrate that. Small restaurant but that makes it one of the best hidden gems in Phoenix.  Ceviche, anticuchos and lomo saltado are a must! If you want to introduce someone to this kind of food, start here!"}
{"text":"Best ceviche I've had in America!!!! So good!  I've been to Peru so there was one delicacy that is very Peruvian but I didn't see on the menu (cuy), I wish it was, but I understand if it's more of a regional thing.  Service was super friendly, great place for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great, and fast.  Everything we had- ceviche, anticuchos, lomo saltado, and causa rellena, were all excellent.  Just wish they had some kind of happy hour.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"been here 3 times. very solid. great food. their fry is incredibly light without being greasy. flavors really balanced, and mostly scratch made. excellent quality food, humble service/decor. 5* all the way."}
{"text":"This is an excellent representation of Peruvian food.  Having lived there for 3 years on and off, I can say that most the dishes were authentic.  My table had the Chupe de Camarones, which was a meal unto itself, 2 people had the the Aji de Gallina- which was very tasty and quite spicy and one had the Tallarines Verdes con Lomo.  We had traditional Pisco sours which were quite tasty as well.  The restaurant is very small but clean and the wait staff is vey pleasant.  The service is slow due to all plates being made to order but that is certainly one of the reasons the food is delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of Peruvian food or curious to learn about it.  The prices are resonable as well. Our tab for 4 came to $153 and that was with 8 Pisco sours.  Like another reviewer said-\"Viva Peru carajo!\""}
{"text":"I always love eating here.   I've never ordered something that didn't taste amazing. Today it was the tacu tacu- so good! I've had the vegetarian and beef versions and they were equally tasty.  Today I decided to order a juice withi lunch and tried the lucuma with milk.  I highly, highly recommend this drink.  It is a native Peruvian fruit that tastes so familiar, but you just can't place it.  And the milk just takes it over the top (in a good way!)  If you haven't eaten here yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"I had never had Peruvian food and was excited to try this place. At 11:45 on Tuesday, it was not too crowded. The service was quick and friendly. My friend had the Arroz Con Pollo (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & pan fried chicken) I had the Arroz Chaufa (Peruvian/Chinese Fusion Style chicken fried rice). Both dishes were great. Mine looked a bit like a standard fried rice but had a much bigger punch of flavor. The highlight of his dish was definitely that cilantro rice. SO GOOD. He ordered white meat and his bone-in breast was a bit dry. I am a dark meat gal, so would order that instead if I get it myself. I have to go back for the ceviche though. I saw a couple plates go by and wish I was not on a 1 hour work break. Those mountains of seafood need time to be savored. Man it looked good! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the ceviche mixo is the best I've ever had. Every dish I've had has been unique and sooo flavorful. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, at a great price
highly recommend, authentic food"}
{"text":"When on a Friday, got in just in time, around 6:30 before it really got packed.  It is a small place so easy to fill up with just a few parties.  The ceviche was awesome!  Pisco sour was tasty but a tad overpriced at $9. Suggest grabbed a few pints of craft brew at the Main Ingredient Ale House down the street beforehand if you are looking for some craft beer."}
{"text":"This was my first time here with my wife. Her words exactly \"What an experience!\" We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We ordered the ceviche with medium heat and the Escobeche con pollo, dark meat. Amazing! So many people have been talking about this place lately. I'm so glad we tried it. We will return!"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything here is good. Tacu tacu seafood is delightful. My favorite though is the lomo saltado."}
{"text":"So good! Felt like I was back in Peru for a moment! Their Rocoto salsa was AMAZING!! The food was fantastic. Family owned and operated, and they were all super nice. Step out of your comfort zone and grab some authentic Peruvian flavors at this place!"}
{"text":"The food ! The service A+! If you stop to eat at only one place in Phoenix, make it Chullo. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"so you can't go wrong with this little hidden gem, if you are into south American or exotic food. they have a great variety of meats such as chicken beef and seafood. only problem is that there's limited parking in front, so you can park behind the restaurant in that little alley way if there's spaces available if not you are more than welcome to use the parking lot across the street. but any rate this place is diffidently worth checking out."}
{"text":"We got hungry at the perfect time. Driving around and saw this place. It's absolutely amazing. Had the pork tamal peruano, ceviche mixto, and tacu tacu lomo al jugo.  Everything was so delicious. Best ceviche we've ever had!! You gotta come in."}
{"text":"Hands down...the best Peruvian dishes in the valley. Ceviche (very spicy but it's a must!), tamale (yummy), and anticucho is the best is all (yes!!!) Pisco Sour with Maracuya - tasty ...friendly and clean - will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you're searching for some good authentic Peruvian food do yourself a favor and come eat here. You can thank me later!!!

Came here to have lunch with family. I had been craving lomo saltado, if you never had this dish order it! Their lomo saltado is very tasty and definitely will come for more. I also had pisco which is Peruvian brandy and trust me that stuff will sneak up on you, I had the mango pisco sour please try it!

And you guys know I am a sucker for dessert  I ordered 

Alfajores, basically a cookie sandwich but don't be fooled this cookie sandwich comes straight from the cookie gods lol. I also ordered Lucuma ice cream which is a tropical fruit that honestly tastes better than pumpkin spice anything. 

Customer service is amazing! Very friendly and funny staff highly recommend this"}
{"text":"Super good hole in the wall place right next to the best beer selection in town at Virginia market. Awesome hidden gem of Phoenix."}
{"text":"My parents lived in Peru for multiple years. Whenever they come into town we come here to eat because of how good and typical their food is. I have introduced the restaurant to multiple friends and they have all loved it."}
{"text":"I went to El Chullo on a Friday night with two other people.
We were seated immediately but it was very busy ( a great sign)!

The food was great-I had arroz chaufa con pollo, which is a sort of chinese rice with chicken, and my sister and friend both had  the lomo saltado.

The dining room is very small; just something to keep in my mind.

Very friendly service,great food, and a great latin vibe."}
{"text":"First time eating Peruvian food so I had no idea what to expect. I read through the small vegetarian section on the menu and took a long shot anyway. Potato and veggies. How bad could it be?  

Well, I would have rather eaten somewhere else. The best thing about the meal was the drink of lucuma juice. It was delicious. Everything else, not worth waiting for. And that was everyone's sentiment.

For the meat eaters, any dish with flavor was just salty. For the vegetarians, the food was not flavorful at all. In fact it was outright bland. Even the sauces were bland! That's hard to swallow, especially when the meal consists of all starchy foods. (potatoes, corn, peas, rice)

For the meat eaters plates included: appetizers of Causa Rellena (two tier potato cake with chicken filling), Papa Rellena (fried potato dough stuffed with meat), Papa a la huancaina (boiled sliced potatoes covered with sauce and egg) and then chicken entrees. 

For the vegetarians plates included: appetizer of Yucca Frita (fried yucca with dipping sauce), entree of veggie Causa Rellena (two tier potato cake with creamy vegetable filling), and sides of Sarsa de Cebolla (onions marinated in lime juice) and Camote Frito (thin strips of salty fried sweet potato). The onions saved the meal. Without them, there would have been no other flavor.

I will try Peruvian food again, but not at El Chullo."}
{"text":"Tasty. Do not pass up an opportunity to dine here. Beef was tender and delicious. Fried egg cooked perfectly. Service is slower paced because it's a small restaurant. Plan accordingly...and keep in mind as you wait that it'll be so worth it."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian Food in the valley! It was authentic and delicious! Still need to try all the menu! And im slowly getting their! A must have is their lomo saltado, ceviche, seco, and Jalea! And of course get a maracuya or chicha morada theor house drink specialty and looking for alcohol get their pisco sour of maracuya the best!"}
{"text":"I am sorry I hadn't been here before. From the outside you have no idea what hidden treasures are inside. Everything we had as appetizers and our meals were great.  I love the new variety to our palettes. I highly recommend you come here."}
{"text":"freshfreshfreshfreshfreshfreshfreshfreshfreshfresh

so slammin. never had Peruvian food before, but if it is anything like what these guys serve, its the best.

get the Lomo Saltado- its french fries swimming in a sea of beef, its juices, and an egg. Canada once again is unable to become #1 in anything bc Lomo Saltado is a better french fry dish than Poutine. 

Also, that Ceviche is bangin. 

As a side-note, the whole meal (which involved just the two aforementioned dishes) featured like 4 different types of corn, which was a really interesting and awesome thing. Never really appreciated corn for its versatile beauty before. These guys had it roasted/salted as a snack-a-tizer, juiced in this delicious drink called Chicha Morada (i think thats its name), and then two other types in the ceviche (a wee lil corn and a big honkin type of Korn). All in all, really opened my eyes to the wonders of corn and i am very thankful. 

lastly, a supremely friendly waitstaff and a very wonderfully priced/tasting Malbec. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Service was ok not the best, food was pretty good the only thing I had a problem with is that we had to wait a long period of time to get our food, they dont have Aji verde sauce, no bread, butter and prices are ridiculous. We were charged $7 extra  to replace the chicken with meet for the arroz chaufa. I have never spent $20 on just arroz chaufa. Lomo saltado was little salty and around $17  we are visiting from Los Angeles and maybe we are just spoiled but there's a big difference. FYI the explanation for the extra charge was that they use sirloin!!! Well in Los Angeles they use Fillet Mignon!

Also if you get a chance to sit at the bar facing the kitchen you might be disappointed that most of there food is microwaved."}
{"text":"I ate a vegetarian dish that was something like a pasta pesto. I immediately felt sick. I'm currently home with food poisoning. Something about my food was not right and even though the place is small, the service took forever. The ceviche was great but that's all the positivity I can muster."}
{"text":"Service was nice, but as a Peruvian I tried there lomo saltaldo and I was very disappointed. Too many fries, everything was soggy and the rice was pretty bad too"}
{"text":"It's been too long since I've had good Peruvian food! Thoroughly enjoyed both the mango and passion fruit Pisco to kick things off and then after a very long wait had Lomo Saltado which was flavorful but a tad salty and short on tomatoes. My husband had a delicious vinegar sauce chicken and we split the crab avocado starter....yum! The service was friendly. On the downside parking is a nightmare and it's in a seriously sketchy looking neighborhood next to a smoke shop/liquor."}
{"text":"Great food! Haven't had anything there that we didn't love. Make sure to make reservations though -- there isn't much seating!"}
{"text":"First time here, great spot.  I liked that there were a lot of regulars and the staff was very friendly and helpful in making recommendations. The food was great and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Love the food! Love the staff. So authentic and I'm so happy it's in the heart of Phoenix!!
The ceviche (both of them) is legit and the pollo saltado is so fulfilling. Let that ish fill yo' mouth with deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"I really love Peruvian food.  I really, really love good Peruvian food.  El Chullo has really, really good Peruvian food.

I had the causa rellena (with crab) and the lomo saltado.  The causa rellena was excellent.  Creamy, savory, with a hint of spice.  It's the best I've had since visiting Peru several years ago.  The lomo saltado was equally delicious.  The sauce was thick.  The meat was tender.  The rice had that Peruvian drug on it that they use to make it so you want to eat the rice on its own.  Perfectly done fries.  Sweet red onion.  Just a really good dish.

I ate too much, but that is always an issue when it comes to Peruvian restaurants.  

Friendly service and I liked the coziness of the space."}
{"text":"Great food! Authentic! Made to order and nice staff. Great atmosphere and music!! One too many flies for me, but still great me"}
{"text":"My favorite!! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu!! And their ceviche is so fresh!! Definitely the best ceviche I've ever had!! I'm always finding excuses to go back here"}
{"text":"The waitress was very helpful, especially since this was our first time trying peruvian food. She explained the ingredients and dishes, including most popular dishes. The food presentation was nice, it tasted great and great service. I wanted something different and this was it. 
(By the way they have additional parking in the back)"}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix for one night and was so excited to find a Peruvian restaurant nearby. They are generally few and far between out here in Arizona! So I was excited to try it out but my experience was just... meh. Maybe I should have stuck to the tried-and-true like ceviche or Lomo saltado or aji de gallina, but I was developing a cough and a sore throat so I wanted chicken soup, and so ordered aguadito, a cilantro-based chicken soup on their menu. It was much too salty and the broth was literally green instead of being clear - though that's probably the way it should be, I don't know because I have never had this particular soup before.

The ambience is that of a little hole in the wall family-run restaurant and the service was fine. If the opportunity presented itself I might go back to try some of the mainstay menu items, but I wouldn't run back."}
{"text":"Finally! This Peruvian joint is legit!  We moved from the Bay Area in California a little under a year ago and have been searching for good and authentic Peruvian food and we're sooo very happy we found it here at El Chullo!  Let me add, that in the Bay Area you have the gammit of delicious food options and even there a good Peruvian place was hard to find.  So we were super surprised that El Chullo met and exceeded our expectations.

1. The ceviche was fabulous! Good amount of acidity, well prepared seafood, and it had all the fixings (corn, sweet potato, onion, etc.)
2. We split an appetizer plate of 3 fixings and all of them were delicious!

The portions were proper size, and the prices were appropriate for the quality of food that was served! 

We will defninitely be back again. 

Lastly, we drove 30 minutes to get here and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I love Peruvian food!  This place is a hidden gem on 7th street.  Prices are fair so don't be shocked if you are looking for something cheap.  This is not \"a five dollar footlong.\"  The place is a family operation and the environment is great.  They show south american soccer which is a plus especially during world cup qualifiers. Any soccer fans out there??? 

Nothing beats a good Pisco Sour or Ceviche.   

Karen is one of my favorite servers. She is direct and to the point and very Knowledgeable.   Her brother in the kitchen is also very funny and friendly.   I would definitely recommend making a visit.

If your wondering what \"El Chullo\" means it is like a andean beanie which covers your ears and if you have ever been in Peru, Ecuador or Northern Chile you would definitely understand why its needed."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diner went to a Peruvian restaurant called El Chullo on 7th Street in Phoenix. I can't pronounce the names of each of the entrees, but I have to say that they were very well prepared and presented. All of the food we had was just excellent. They weren't too spicy and artfully presented. They also serve Peruvian drinks. The waitress was very kind and able to explain each of the dishes, and each was delicious. Joining us this week were my daughter and her husband who is Chilean/Peruvian - so we had a subject matter expert. The Jolly Diners rated El Chullo a 3.5 out of 5. The decor is nice, parking is a bit challenging, but worth it because the food tastes great and is reasonably priced.If you like to try something different and authentically Peruvian, you'll have to try El Chullo."}
{"text":"Simple. Family owned. Authentic Peruvian. The pescado dish is amazing. The garlic sauce they serve is addicting. Quinoa dish is also amazing. Small cozy spot with the whole family r
There to take care of you. They know what they're doing and the do it well. I hope this place does well. Phoenix needs more authentic spots like this. Go here. Leave happy."}
{"text":"Most excellent, our waiter recommended an appetizer, drinks and the main courses. I've never had Peruvian food before, I am now a fan, hook, line and sinker!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious.  If you have not tried Peruvian before, this one will be a very good representative, and not only within the valley.  The seviche was awesome, make sure you ask for mild unless you are ready for a real kick.  The lomo saltado was very tasty.  For dessert we had Lucuma Ice cream and an alfajor, which combined are even better, but make sure you have someone to share with.  Service was very nice and also very quick."}
{"text":"Delicious one of a kind dishes here!! I had the ceviche and I ordered it medium on the spicyness....OMG taste buds went crazy!! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!! The traditional Peruvian drinks are refreshing and tasty!!"}
{"text":"This Restaurant has improved a lot.
Food taste very good. 
Customer service is excellent. 
The place is small but is couzy."}
{"text":"Great food and biggest glass of wine EVER.  Very nice people.  And the lunch special is enough for two!"}
{"text":"Incredible meal.  Excellent service.  It was my first time eating Peruvian food and I appreciated the time the server took to describe the menu items.  Wonderful cerviche."}
{"text":"Tasty Peruvian cuisine and very attentive staff.  We had great soup, fried fish, and the lomo saltado was scrumptious. I will definitely be going again to explore more Peruvian dishes."}
{"text":"When looking for new places to check out, I saw a review by Brent C. that caught my eye - Peruvian!? Call me basic if you have to, but I've never tried Peruvian before! I went with my girlfriend from California and she helped guide my newbie tastes.
We started our first course with a Papa Rellena - a fried breaded potato with meat and raisin filling- absolutely delicious. It even reminded me a little of a Filipino dish at home, which was a bonus. Then we had the Causa Rellena de Pollo, which is sort of like a chicken salad meets this bomb yellow sauce on steroids. I can't think of another way to explain it but there was also an egg there and avocado, so there was a medley of flavors that all meshed together. 
I ordered the Ceviche Mixto which had onions, lime, shrimp, squid, and more. It was everything a seafood lover could have dreams about because the seafood was fresh and the seasonings- refreshing. 
Finally, we ordered the Alfajor for dessert. If you love Tres Leches or have a sweet tooth of any kind, you must order this! It helps that there were pictures of this award winning dessert all over the walls. 
Overall, the restaurant is unassuming but who cares? The food was excellent and our waitress was kind and attentive. For my first time trying Peruvian, I can honestly report it will not be my last!"}
{"text":"Peruvian cuisine is Interesting,  flavorful and varied. El Chullo is a very small restaurant so recommend making reservations. Thee stars only as I thought the staff was not the friendliest and the Sangria was mostly fruit juice and very little wine. The parking lot in front of restaurant is very small with very few spots so be ready to park in the neighborhood. 

Ordered the Lomo Saltado, which essentially is slivers of beef with French fries. and while I thought was good, could have had more meat considering the price of $ 14.95 . El Chullo is not an inexpensive restaurant. A word of caution, the restaurant closes early on Sundays at 7 P.M so get there early."}
{"text":"My husband and I went back to this place for our second try thinking maybe they were having a bad day the first time we went there. I don't remember the name of what I had but it tasted horrible the fish was uncooked the tomato base sauce tasted like canned sauce and beside all that our food took forever.  Our waitress was nice but not our food.  I've had peruvian food plenty of times in the past and I love it. Arizona lacks international food so these places get glorified because they don't have much competition."}
{"text":"Super good food!!!  I had such a nice experience here.  This place is really small and sort of divey but dont let that scare you.  It was one of the best meals Ive had in years!  We were hosted by a friend from Peru and he made sure we tried so many different items off the menu.  My favorite items were the Lomo Saltado.  It was really tender beef and so flavorful.  The ceviche was amazing too.  And something I didnt think I would  like, but tried anyway was the beef heart kabobs.  It was delicious!!  Oh and they have amazing flan for dessert.  Our waiter grew up in Lima, Peru and he told us so many cool things about Peru and the food there.  We will definitely come back here again.  They also have live music sometimes and host events.  We parked in the front of the resturant, right off 7th St and that was awkward.  We did find out that there is better parking in the back, so park in the back and come in through the back door."}
{"text":"I love Peruvian cuisine and really wanted to like this place. I went with a few friends on our lunch break. The waitress was helpful with food suggestions. They didn't have any lunch specials which was a bummer because the prices were ridiculously high. While waiting really long for our food the power went out. It was also hot and stuffy so you leave smelling like garlic and onions.They also didn't have my tallarin with chicken ready until basically it was time for me to leave. I had to remind the waitress several times until I finally went up to the register and asked for my food to go. So did not get the full dining experience. Anyway, when I got back to work I realized they messed up my order. They gave me steak instead of chicken. I was hungry so I ate it and the steak was undercooked. I was so dissatisfied I called them to see if someone could rectify the issue. Karen answered the phone and was so rude. She became combative and not customer service oriented at all. She wouldn't put a manager on the phone that is when I decided to leave a review."}
{"text":"This is a small but cute restaurant there is additional parking in the back.  Food is really good and very authentic.  I had the ají de gallina (shredded chicken, potatoes and rice) make sure you leave room for dessert the alfajor"}
{"text":"I'm a Peruvian girl and I always think my mom's Peruvian home cooked meals are actually the best. I came to El Chullo on Peruvian Independence Day (July 28th) with my dad in order to celebrate.
I ordered the lomo saltado and he ordered the cau cau. As much as I love my mom, I hate to say that this lomo saltado is just as good (maybe even a bit better - please don't tell her). I told my hubby that I have to take him here so that he can try it out for himself. I even loved their rocoto (hot peppered sauce) and I dipped my french fries in them. It was spicy...but a good spice. 
I highly recommend this place if you want to try good Peruvian food!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Peruvian restaurant we can actually go to in Phoenix!  The food was absolutely delicious.  The ceviche is outstanding and we'll be ordering that every time.  Everything we ordered was delicious and even my 1 year old enjoyed the food and she's a picky eater.  Our waitress was Maria and she was great and gave great recommendations.  We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to go to El Chullo this morning for 'breakfast' (the quotes are because it was closer to lunch time and their breakfast foods are more like American lunch/dinner foods). This place is incredibly authentic. Our waiter (and possibly an owner?) is from a town just outside of Lima, so ya... pretty legit. The way their breakfast works is they have 3 choices that feed two people, each for 20$. The choices are chicharrones with a tamal, bread, and two coffees or a tenderloin sautee with bread and two coffees, or an egg dish with a tamal, bread and two coffees. We decided to get the tenderloin and add a tamal (cuz I wanted to try it). The tamal is large, delicious, and just like the ones I had when I was in Peru last summer... this is the real deal and very distinct from the typical Mexican tamale you may have elsewhere in Phoenix. The tamal has a little hard boiled egg (which obviously I ate and the husband didn't), some meat, some olives, and some hot peppers and served with an onion/citrus salad.... so good. I could just eat those tamals and be happy.  The tenderloin came in a sauce of sorts with onion and tomato and we ate it with the giant rolls given to us. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. Their coffee was even good and we drank it black. The service is great. This place beats all of the other Peruvian restaurants that I have tried in town hands down and really took me back to when I was in Peru....like a little slice of vacation in my own neighborhood. I will certainly be back, I want to try dinner for sure and the chicharrones breakfast.... I think this place has serious 5 star potential, so we will see!"}
{"text":"Ell Chullo is a hidden little gem in central Phoenix with fabulous Peruvian food and drinks that shouldn't be missed by anyone who loves south american food. It is a family run restaurant that takes their cooking seriously with great service and a fun atmosphere. Don't miss the Pisco Sours, Lomo Saltado or awesome ceviche. Save room for dessert because they have some amazing homemade creations and don't forget to order the outstanding hot chocolate made with special chocolate from Peru. My only complaint is that their parking is not ideal."}
{"text":"My first time eating at this restaurant and all i can say is that the food is delicious! I tried about 6 different items and they all made my taste buds very happy! Very flavorful savory food."}
{"text":"Attentive service at the bar.  It takes a while to get food, but it is prepared thoughtfully, so that is absolutely fine.  I had the lomo saltado, which was quite good."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat foreign food. Very clean restaurant with amicable servers who take the time to explain their national dishes. Superb!"}
{"text":"This place is a must do for us when we are in Phoenix, Arizona. We went here last year and this year it was a must for us to eat here. The food is great. It's a small restaurant but it's the best Peruvian food we've had. We are from California and look forward to returning to this place."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here 3-4 times and sad to say, but the quality has been declining over time.  The place is very small with even smaller parking lot.  Lomo saltado and ceviche are usually very good, but the last few times, they have not been on point.  Rice was dry and hard, the meat was tough.  Ceviche wasn't as flavorful as was in the past.  Food overall is still pretty good, just not packing the tasty punch it did in the beginning."}
{"text":"I ate here on April 1, 2017 with 15 other people in an ethnic dining MeetUp.  I also ate here last fall, the day after having a bad dinner at Villa Peru. Villa Peru wanted to charge me for the very bland Chupe de Camarones Soup, that I wanted to send back to trade for something else, even though I only ate a few spoonfuls of the broth.  I never had any restaurant force me to pay for what I did not like and wanted to send back and trade for something else, in my life, and I am 20 years older than I look!  I went to Villa Peru 2 years ago, and also did not like my food, neither did other people at my table, to the point that they still had to pay for their wasted dish, AND pay for a side of \"safe french fries\" just because they were so hungry.   But I was open to giving Villa Peru another chance.   I Yelped Villa Peru 1 star because of bland, expensive, skimpy food, and scathing service.  

The first time I ate at El Chullo, was the day after the Villa Peru fiasco, I ate the cerviche.  But the fish in both the Villa Peru and El Chullo, was very bland, boring, and flavorless.  It tasted like they just added the lime juice marinate to the fish the moment before bringing the fish to my table.  So I took it home, and four days later, the lime permeated the fish, and it tasted delicious!  

But I did not Yelp El Chullo based on the one-time bland and boring fish in their cerviche, only.  I wanted to give El Chullo another chance, which i did when I ate with these 15 other people on April 1.

I tasted so many dishes, including cerviche second chance.  Very bland and boring, I mean the flavor of the fish.  I like my own homemade cerviche the best.

The steak was flavorful and good portion, but very gristley and full of oingy boingies not polite to spit out."}
{"text":"I ordered this Arroz con Mariscos which consisted of rice sautéed with a seafood blend and various vegetables. Very flavorful and definitely recommend. My girlfriend ordered another dish then changed her mind to the ceviche but I think there was a communication error and the waitress accidentally brought out the first dish. The waitress apologized and immediately brought out the ceviches. My girlfriend didn't really enjoy the ceviche. Either way, this restaurant is a great place to eat at in arizona and great customer service! Not many Peruvian restaurants in arizona but luckily this one does it right."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came here with my mom on a Thursday afternoon which was fairly slow. Our server was very attentive & the food was fantastic! My mom had never had Peruvian before & could not stop raving about the yuca fries! I am a huge fan of their vegetarian menu & highly recommend the Tacu Tacu. My mom ordered the Carapulcra & thought it was delicious. She couldn't get over the rice pyramid! Will definitely be frequenting this place more often."}
{"text":"This is a great place for authentic Peruvian food. Super delicious!
Pretty small, crowded restaurant though with sometimes long wait times and no seating while you wait. Also a little pricey."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I won't be able to say enough good things about this restaurant. Jeez - everything from the delectable adult beverages, through the amazing appetizers, to the main courses - wow!!! Over the top delicious. It's another one of those places I don't want to get too crowded, but I don't want it to go away. Stay busy, but not too busy, you know? Head over there - you won't regret the Papa Rellena for starters, the Arroz con Pollo with its perfectly seasoned chicken and yellow rice (enough for 2, btw), or the Carapulcra - a heavenly potato stew with yucca that I still can't get out of my mind. Enjoy. I know you will."}
{"text":"First time trying a Peruvian Meal!  Loved it and the waitress was great , Thank you Adriana.  Gonna bring my family here to try some delicious seafood dishes and I'm especially looking forward for dessert next time!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was awesome! Very friendly and customer oriented waitress. If you like spicy ask for the red home made hot salsa.....it had a good kick. The Pollo Saltado was delicious, the sauce mixed in with the rice and fries is so overwhelmingly good it was like a powerful blast of taste. We had an appetizer of cow heart skewers, they were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. They were paired with potatoes and the combination was outstanding! Definitely a good spot to try! I will be coming back and bringing friends!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe they've only been open a couple days! The meal was fantastic from start to finish. Tried the anticuchos, carapulcra, and alfajores for dessert. Everything tasted fresh, well seasoned, and home made. Great portions too! Will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"good stuff, the cilantro chicken is great,the fried rice is solid, and the lomo saltado has a great sauce. I am not a fan of much of the other stuff since it seems to lack flavor to me personally but the things that do work. Work very well."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Phoenix! The Food was amazing. it is run by a Peruvian family.  Our server so genuinely enjoyed his work.  The food was delicious and artistically plated."}
