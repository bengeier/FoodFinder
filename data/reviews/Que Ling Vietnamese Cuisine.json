{"text":"\"Que Ling\", or as it used to be called, \"Boston Restaurant\" was a good old-fashioned HK Cafe with good brunches and value meals. Even now that they've swapped over to Vietnamese cuisine, I still head there mostly for their HK food.

The secret to the place is to NOT order the Vietnamese food - that's not what their chefs or original owners ran the restaurant as. Go for the lunches and order their baked food, it's much better than ordering their Vietnamese food and more authentic as well.

(Also as with most HK Cafes, don't go for dinner - same portions, upped price)"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday as our regular place was closed on Monday, I drove by the place and thought ok it's Vietnamese why not? 
So we went inside and there was only a couple of people, we took our seat and was started to order.
We got the BBQ meat with noodles
a so called salad.
Chicken fingers and French fries, yes they sold it and my daughter ordered it.
So the food came out and I was very disappointed because the noodles were over cooked and there was hardly and meat in the dish.
The so called chicken fingers were fish sticks..yuck ...
Let's just say we refused to pay for the meal and got up to leave, there was a language barrier which made it hard for everyone to understand.
At the end of the day I will not be coming here EVER!!!!

{"text":"I can't really comment all too much on the Vietnamese food they serve here, but the sizzling plates and HK style food is great! 

Portion sizes are huge. For 17.99 the mixed grill plate comes with soup and bun, a drink, and included chicken and beef steak, pork chop, sausage, bacon, fries and veggies. I took half of it home to go because there was no way I could finish it. 

Been here many times (with family or with friends) and I have found their service to be very good. They have 3 TVs. 1 running off Bell, 1 for a Chinese TV box and the last is a kids movie channel. If you ever want to watch a sports game while eating Chinese food, this would be the place! They're always accommodating whenever we want to watch a Blue Jays game. They also have a liquor license as well!"}
{"text":"First time here...Vietname noodles and HK Style food...match?  of course not.  No wonder people score it that low.  Sunday afternoon. two tables...sigh.

The vietname cold milk tea...nothing special..not taste as other vietname store. i mean not strong"}
{"text":"Short review: worst possible experience after an impromptu first visit at this restaurant which replaced the boston steakhouse at the intersection between brimley and sheppard. 

The story: walked in with my sister for lunch after seeing that there was a new pho place in the neighbourhood. 

The bad:
1. from the get go our experience was a negative one since we were asked to sit at a table that wasn't even cleaned from the previous guests, despite having multiple tables that were free and already set up
2. we ordered the lamb chop meal ($13.99) with a cold milk tea and the curry chicken lunch special ($7.50) with a hot milk tea which included a free soup and a (hot) drink per order. the waiter did not bring up the fact that the cold drink would include an extra $0.75. 
3. when the waiter cleared the table after our order, she basically dropped the eating utensils on the table (butter knife, spoon, fork) without a napkin to buffer the contact between the utensils and table. 
4. the soup that came first was very salty, but passable due to the buns that came with it. 
5. the lamb chop came for my sister, and she immediately noticed two things: the cut was two entire cuts of fatty meat, and the meat was completely raw despite asking for a medium rare (which our server ordered as a \"3\"). 
6. the lamb chop was remade, still a fatty cut, but much more lean meat in comparison to the previous cut. this was super salty as well. 
7. when my curry chicken arrived, this was really salty as well, to the point that half my rice (which was a small bowls worth) was finished after having only eaten 3-5 pieces of curry chicken (no more than 1/4 of the curry chicken dish was consumed before we decided to just pay the bill and leave) 
8. our drinks did not arrive until after we asked for the bill (which itself took a long time to arrive). when we pointed out why there was an extra $0.75 on our bill the waiter said it was due to the cold drink (very rudely pointing to the bottom of a separate menu we did not look at (they had 3 different menus). by this point we just wanted to leave so we paid the bill and left. 

The good: 
1. we pointed out that the lamb chop was overly raw to a separate lady (who seemed like the manager) and she immediately apologized and told us that a \"3\" for lamb chops is usually inedible... and that people usually order upwards of \"5-7\". she offered to remake the order for us. 

Conclusion: horrible service experience. overly salty food and soup (curry chicken, lamb chop, vegetable stew). manager was nice. will not be returning."}
{"text":"Seriously not great...

Hubby got the Portuguese chicken rice, it was dry and sauce was sparse.

I got the lemongrass chicken rice and...ugh. The only thing I ate most of was the pickled radish. The chicken was doused in this concoction of really strong herby and gingery seasoning. I couldn't eat even half of it. Too strong.

Milk tea was not good.

Cream of mushroom soup was salty and watery.

Really expensive compared to some of the better places. 11.99 for lunch?? Not coming back."}
{"text":"Randomly came here with the family. The place is what you expect it to be, a typical viet/Chinese restaurant. They do serve authentic Vietnamese food, and the prices are actually good for the quality/portion you get. We had ordered the Portuguese chicken with spaghetti, highly recommend. Tasty and enough for three people really. Service was great too, they gave us enough lemons and sauces (we just love to have excess). Most likely will come back here, for a cheap lunch on a weekend!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been this confused at a restaurant in a LONG time. As people said, Vietnamese food + HK cafe food. It's not fusion. It's like two separate menus but served in the same restaurant. Given the location, the ambiance, and the service, I really don't see how the prices here are justified. This isn't to say that the location, ambiance, and service are horrendous, just that the food seems quite overpriced. Lunch specials are $11.99? $12.99? And we're talking things like a spaghetti bolognese with cheese served with a soup and a hot drink. Same thing other places of this caliber would cost me $7.99/$8.99 including drink. Sure, there's a slightly larger portion and there's cheese, but the issue still remains. I also don't see how that's a special price. Speaking of this spaghetti bolognese, my friend asked for less cheese on hers and the waitress said that it's a bolognese with cheese. It has to have the cheese. They didn't reduce it. It's not like they couldn't. I mean, just don't sprinkle it on top...

I got one of their spicy Vietnamese noodles. The small size was $8.50? $8.99? Something like that. It's on the cheaper end of entrees here. It was a good portion for lunch. It had a piece of pig blood jelly, a few pieces of pork, some of beef, and perhaps tendon? And a slice or two of Vietnamese ham/sausage of some sort. The meat was rather tough, some of it, but the ham/sausage was pretty good. Given this evaluation, I think their Vietnamese noodle options are better than their HK cafe options, but I don't really care to do a return trip to figure out if I'm right or not."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Combination of Vietnamese and HK style food. We ordered Portuguese chicken with spaghetti and the meat rice rolls. Prices for the food were quite good and the food was pretty tasty. Would go again.
Recommend going here if you're looking for a fast place to eat with good service."}
{"text":"The soup lacks complex flavour and I don't like the noodles they have selected but you get tons of meat, tripe, flank with the house special. There are better options down the street so I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place use to be HK cafe Boston Steak House. Good news is that they kept alot of the old menu. They still have that soft butter bun in a combo with a meal and a drink. They have a lot more Veitnamese options on the menu hence the new name. Tried their pho and it was sub par. The noodles were over cooked and a bit too soft and the soup needs some work. I would stick with the stuff on the old menu."}
{"text":"My pho noodle &soup was luke warm. Asked them to make it hot and they did by throwing my noodle and soup in the pot.  Noodle came back soft and nasty. Meat was over cooked. Don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Que Ling is the former Boston Steak House, although if you look very closely at the exterior sign you'll still see a Boston Steak House sign there. In fact, if you miss Boston Steak House, Que Ling still has some of the offerings that Boston Steak House had.

The pho menu is very simple, practically zero exotic offerings. I had the cooked beef rice noodles. Didn't had high expectations given the setting, but it was okay. Portions were quite large, but not surprisingly the noodle quality and broth quality weren't there at all. For $7, however, I wasn't too upset by it.

Service was average Asian quality. They're mostly the same employees from Boston Steak House, so whatever treatment you got from there, expect it from here as well.

I likely won't return as there are better options in Scarborough for pho and HK style cafe."}
{"text":"Don't ever come here for Vietnamese food. Not sure why they would even bother trying. Its clearly an HK restaurant still. Their HK food items are great but their Viet options are quite horrible. Pho broth tasted like the instant powder you get at the grocery store. And their spring rolls were drenched in oil. Disgusting."}
{"text":"This is your typical viet restaurant, prices are pretty for the portion size. It was a little bit weird that they had other foods like spaghetti on the menu.  Well anywayz i came here for the vietnamese food. And it was good! Pretty good space, lots of room for customers and pretty good staff friendly and inviting. If your looking for decent place to eat, and your craving for some pho this is good enough. Just dont expect them to WOW you!"}
{"text":"One day it was Boston Steakhouse, the next time I checked it is Que Ling Vietnamese Cuisine. 2nd location of Que Ling Vietnamese  https://www.yelp.ca/biz/que-ling-restaurant-toronto 

Here you can still find items from Boston including their Sizzling Plates and other Hong Kong Style Cafe stables.

Banh Cuon (steamed rice rolls) ($8) was A-OK. There are not too many restaurants in the area that serves banh cuon made in house. Que Ling House Pho ($8) good in portion size but some of the meat not cooked properly, especially the tendon was still hard and why there was BBQ pork in my pho?!!!

Glad to see that Que Ling opens in this neighbourhood. I will be back for more banh cuon!"}
{"text":"This place gets bonus points for its price point and also Vietnamese authenticity. However, it is quantity over quality. It used to be the Boston Steakhouse but has changed into more of a Vietnamese/HK style fast food restaurant. It is usually not too busy, but the portions are quite big. I had the spring roll which was very tasty and authentic with the right kind of crispiness for skin. I also had the pho, and that was a big portion, some meat. You are definitely looking at quantity of food for a very low price at this location. It also came with a HK milk tea which I thoroughly enjoyed to end of a meal."}
