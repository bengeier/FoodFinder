{"text":"Food:  Lunch specials ranged from $7-9 Thai iced tea was $3.50 but we found it a bit watered down (not as much condensed milk or tea flavour as we would've liked) Pad Thai: sweet and sauce and not ketchup based Khao Soi: the noodles didn't seem like egg noodles but the overall flavour was good. There was some spice to it which we liked. The beef was ok, not too dry like most places.   Service:  We experienced good service and had no complaints. Our server patiently explained the items we weren't familiar with.   Parking: We went on a Sunday for lunch and there was ample parking in the small plaza's lot.   Overall: we would go back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Not authentic at all..... NOT AT ALL   Khao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it \"authentic\" ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.    Tom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.     Curry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.   Service was fast.   Servers were fine.   Music was fine.     Overall poor quality food.... Will not be coming back and DO NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai I've had, not the worst. We were two and ordered 3 main dishes: The Pad Kee Mao was the favorite dish we ordered. It was very tasty. The Holy Basil beef was okay, it was missing some flavour. And the green curry was just a fail. The colour, the texture and the flavour were deceiving. The service was so-so. They made an error with the  curry, they gave us beef instead of chicken. We also wanted to replace the jasmine rice with sticky rice, but the sticky rice there were sweet (like dessert sweet), so we changed it back to jasmine rice. I'll only be coming back for the pad Kee Mao, probably take-out."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome! We were visiting from Chicago and looking for something to eat in the area. We ordered the holy basil with egg, Penang curry, pad ke mao and khoa sai - everything was very flavorful! This place is better than sukothai."}
{"text":"Wow!  Food is incredible.  We had the lemongrass chicken wings, the Pad Kee Mao and the Gaeng masaman chicken.  All three dishes were fantastic.  Pretty comparable to Khao San Road and Sabai Sabai.  And they deliver!!!  Finally a place in the Beaches area that serves decent food.  Price is pretty reasonable!  Way better than the other Thai places east of Yonge St.  Only complaint is that they forgot our order of free spring rolls.  The food more than made up for it, but it would have been nice to try them."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but they need to 1) give their sit down customers some love (a lot of deliveries and take-outs) and 2) work on portioning their plates properly (our Pad Kee Mao had half the noodle compared to next table).  I might return (for take out) if I'm in the area... not a place where I'll make a special trip for.  Also, I over heard them telling customers that take-out takes 20 minutes.  It might be wise to call in to order before showing up."}
{"text":"Bar far the best Thai food Ive had in toronto so far. Always a pleasure to eat here or call ahead and pick up. Never an issue and the staff are absolutely lovely. Food is amazing and authentic. Reminds me of the restaurants back home. My top 3 would be Masaman curry, Panang curry and Pad see eew. Get in ma belly !!"}
{"text":"really feels authentic and the shop is quaint  it would be SO much more popular if in a better location!"}
{"text":"Over priced food for a Thai restaurant in Scarborough. The quality of their food was good for the first month after they had opened, since then, their dishes are simply bland.  Khao soi chicken - at $11.95 the noodles aren't even included, just the fried egg noodles. Not sure if they've changed how they serve the food now but I wasn't too pleased. Several high-end Thai restaurants serve noodles in addition to the curry and fried egg noodles for the same price or less.  Masaman shrimp - Bland tasting and most times the shrimps aren't cleaned properly.   Karee (yellow curry) - I've had better. Again it's bland tasting - I think they use store bought flavoring and just dump it in. It would explain how the food is always ready within 10 minutes for take-out.  Not the greatest restaurant, but if you're looking for Thai in Scarborough, I guess this is the only option."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner. Place is nicely decorated and service was attentive.  Ordered - Beef satay - comes with 2 large skewers. the beef was unforuntarly not grilled or atleast not grilled enough. It was well marinated and soft but i expected it to have more a char. The sauces that accompany it were very nice.  cold shrimp roll - this should be renamed the lettuce roll. it was around 80% lettuce and what seemed like 1 shrimp cut and split between all the rolls. very disappointing.  pad kee mao - Verily well done. Did find it a bit oily and did not have as much noodles as expected. instead it had a large amount of peppers. if you are a fan of peppers then thats great but i was not. Overall i found the experiencing lacking. Maybe i just ordered the wrong dishes. Am willing to give it another try later."}
{"text":"Discovered this place through uber eats. Some of the best Thai I've had in the city! I've tried the beef khao soi, the massaman curry and pad Thai...all were delicious. Very flavourful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I think it is the best Thai food restaurant I have ever been in Toronto.   The dishes are good portion and reasonable price.  I always order pad keep Mao, Tom khan soup and mango sticky rice.  They do have lunch special that the dish portion is same as dinner."}
{"text":"Best Khao Soi in Toronto, and the staff is incredibly nice and warm! And when you think your food cant get any better, make sure to get some sticky rice and mango."}
{"text":"Can't believe how great the panang curry is.  They are super quick to prepare an order - really love the chicken satay too.  Great to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food great value and more authentic than a lot of places i've been"}
{"text":"In a drab area like Danforth this place is like an oasis! Great food and environment! Green Thai Curry and The Spring Rolls are a must have!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day. The food was hit and miss. The curry puffs, mango salad, and Thai iced tea are must haves. The Panang curry was very good as well. The fish looked promising but was not great, and the pad Thai was my least favourite. The green curry was mediocre.   The servers are very laid back and didn't pay us too much attention. We waited longer than usual to place our order. I wish I could say it's because they were swamped due to Mother's Day rush but the place was not very busy, so the servers definitely need to be more attentive to their dine in customers. The customer service needs improvement. Friendly staff certainly would have made this experience more pleasant. Once we placed our order, the food did arrive at a decent speed. The plates you eat the entire meal on are appetizer plates which is quite small. I asked the server for the entree size plates and she said this is all they have.   They expanded the space by adding another room, now a total of 100 seats. That room is in the back with no windows. Personally, I wouldn't be comfortable in a room with no windows so we opted to sit in the front room."}
{"text":"We ordered pad thai and sad yes to 'spicy'. It wasn't just spicy, it was so hot that we couldn't even eat a quarter of the plate. There is a difference between 'spicy' and 'suicide' and they need to make that clearer."}
{"text":"It seems like Scarborough is starting to step it up a notch. No longer will you have to endure the long waits in the downtown core to enjoy authentic Thai.  Jatujak does a great job of satisfying my Thai cravings.  Ordered the pad Thai, and khoa Soi. Everything was done nicely, authentic flavours which are key.when eating ethnic foods and Jatujak did not disappoint.   Came here at lunch time on a weekday, not busy at all which would have me concerned about how they can stay in business.  However this is their second location so I'm sure they will be able to hang in there as the word gets out about this new location.   The mango sticky rice is a must try and I will definitely be coming back to try the curry."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is exceptional as is the service. Surprising as this culinary delight is located in an unimpressive rundown strip mall (Victoria Park). Mango Salad: perfect start to you meal and large enough to share (4) Thai Curry Puffs: must try, can you stop after one? Gaeng Kiew Whan (green curry),  my personal favorite Jatujak Pad Thai: a little too sweet for my tastes  Great value..."}
{"text":"Very affordable, great Thai food (with big portion sizes). The restaurant is quite small, so if you're coming with a lot of people, I would call ahead. That being said, it doesn't seem to get a lot of walk-in customers, so if you're going with two-four people, a reservation doesn't seem as pertinent. It's a bit out of the way, but definitely worth the trip. I've gotten my boyfriend, parents, and friends to come with me, and they'll all be returning as well!"}
{"text":"Had a large takeout order a few days back and had to say everything was delicious.   The great thing is for large orders they even throw in freebies like a pad thai or something of your choosing. Prices are reasonable compared to the downtown hot spots and food is equally good. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant! Big portion sizes so you will definitely have leftovers to take home:) \"Extra spicy\" was very very hot so if you want it spicy (but not too much), go with medium spicy. Mango salad and green curry were my 2 favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place, but Kingston is just too out of the way for me, so when I heard they opened one up at VP, I definitely wanted to try. I brought my Ma/Dad to try this place out for lunch on Sunday. It was empty with one customer there at the time. My parents weren't really that hungry, so we didn't order much...=(  I got the 'Thai Iced Tea'.($3.5) Its a Sweeeetttt milk tea like. My parents both said its too sweet for them, I tried a few thai tea at Pai, Sukhothai, so its alright. I think 'Pai' has the sweetest thickest thai tea for sure...Makes you thirsty a bit too.  Got the 'Chicken Satay' ($6) for two skewers w/ peanut sauce. The chicken were moist and plumped, but the peanut sauce is a bit runny and not that great.  Parents got the lunch special on til 3pm... Pad Kee Mao ($8). Its basically flat rice noodle cooked in basil flavouring, and there's green long beans, peppers, egg, and your protein, in our case chicken. I didn't try this dish, but my parents said its alright...Not too impressed. I was beginning to feel bad that I brought them to a dud place...  I got their 'pad gra pao' w/ minced chicken ($10) Its steam rice, with minced chicken and thai basil aroma, with a fried egg on top. Its not that bad. I asked for medium spice, and it definitely had spice. I'd say it can be considered spicy for ppl that don't handle spice well.  Our bill came to $37+, and my parents are surprised it cost this much for the limited amount of food we ordered hahaha (parents use to chinese style 5-6 course for $40) =)  The bill has an interesting tip mentioning if you gave 10% tip it would equal that to your bill or 15%, or 20% or higher...My parents wanted to give 10%, but I felt bad b/c its new and server has barely any business, so I opted to give more...11% suckaaaa!!!! joking... I gave 15%! I probably wanna come back and try their pad thai and other stuff next time...Expect to sit on plastic chairs too...Set-up and area is very basic."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place! As good as Khao San Road, or even better! Since they have a wide selection on their menu and all items I've tried so far are great. Reasonable price for the quality of food and closer to me than downtown Thai restaurants. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try really good Thai food :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. We had the pad thai with beef, spring rolls and the holy basil with egg. Delicious."}
{"text":"Just had takeout. We got the pad Thai and gang penang. The food was very good. As good as any Thai food we've had in the city. This joint is totally worth a try. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the reviews on this page. The atmosphere is very cozy, similar to Khub Kao at Birchmount and Shepperd. We arrived with 5 people and just shared a bunch of dishes. The service is quick and like any other place, pretty much leave you alone until you need something.   Chicken Jatujak Pad Thai: Very tasty, the noodles were not overcooked and had a nice bounce to it. We added shrimp to ours and it came with 5-6 big shrimp, not the little dinky ones.   Khao Soi: We did not know what this was going to be. It was pretty much fried egg noodles in yellow curry. It was tasty but a little heavy since the noodles were fried and soaked up a lot of the curry. Each bite was a bite with gushing curry held in by the noodles.   Mango Salad: The presentation of this dish was beautiful. Almost like a cornucopia. Very tasty and how any mango salad should taste.   Holy Basil Chicken with rice: A little on the saltier side but nonetheless very tasty. There was a lot of sauce and was topped off with a nice fried egg. I was hoping to get a little more of the basil flavour but there was more fish sauce.   Green curry with Chicken: I LOVE GREEN CURRY. I will have it for any occasion at any time of day. This dish was delicious. I did not find it as spicy as other places have made it however. Which was good because a lot of my guests could not handle the heat but I did hope for a little more.   Coconut rice: we got a side of coconut rice to see what it was like. This is not like any other coconut rice we have ordered to go with our meal. It was very sweet. We almost did not expect it. It seemed as if it was not cooked with coconut cream but rather just regular white rice mixed with sweetened coconut milk that you would eat in a dessert. This is also topped off with some fresh juliened kaffir lime leaf. It is the first thing you smell when you get it.   Mango sticky rice: The presentation of this dish was cute. It came in a heart and the sticky rice was in three different colours topped off with some sesame seeds. Tasted great so we ordered a second one.   Thai Iced Tea: delicious drink that came in a nice mason jar. Very sweet as usual.   Overall this place is great and I would definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Certainly a hidden  !! We ordered a chicken pad thai with their house sauce, red curry with shrimp , mango sticky rice and thai iced tea . The thai iced tea could be less sweet than it will be prefect !! Otherwise the mango sticky rice is super yummy !! The red curry is full of coconut flavour  and i believe the pad thai is a sweet sauce which is something you can never get from thai express haha . Certainly recommending this place to the others"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a Mother's Day dinner. Now while I get take out here a few times a year and absolutely love their curry, I can tell you that this one experience has put me off from ever eating here again.   Firstly, after speaking to an employee for a table for 4 and asking for an approximate wait time we were forgotten.  I could forgive this as it was quite busy when we went.   Secondly, it took quite some effort to flag down a waiter to order. We spoke to three waitresses before being served. Again, it was quite busy and the staff looked very frazzled, I could forgive this.   Lastly, while our appetizers and two main dishes came out very quickly, the remaining two main dishes for my mother and myself were forgotten.  We kept waiting and waiting until it had been half an hour since the other two members of our party received their main dishes. When we asked about it I found out that they had forgotten our order and asked us again what we ordered. We received no apology and I had to ask multiple times what happened. This I could not forgive.   The food my mother received had a smoky flavour and some of the vegetable were charred black and at the same time the vegetables were undercooked as if they half assed it for us to get our food quickly. After all the effort it took to even get the food we couldnt be bothered to tell them.   At the end of the meal I asked our waitress politely if we could speak to the manager. She said ok, went to the bar area and spoke to a man and came back to us saying she was the manager.    I can honestly say this experience has ruined this restaurant for me and my family. We can definely say we will never eat in here again.   **in response to the owner: No we did not finish all the food. I could not finish my meal because I had no appetite by the time it got to my table. I took it to go. And my mother did not finish her meal because of the smoky/burnt flavour and undercooked veggies. Her meal was given to us for free only after I spoke to the \"manager\" which was very nice."}
{"text":"Very good thai food for Toronto and especially for the area! Service is very good and we always get in and out in a reasonable time during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Jatujak, and the quality of the food was good. It was hot, and it tasted fresh.  A little note about the delivery man though. He expects a tip beforehand for the food, which is really unprofessional of him."}
{"text":"I went here with my buddy yesterday and I am soooo glad I did. It's a cute, cozy place with such gentle and genuine customer service. We were the only ones there at the time, but I know the customer service will still remain the same whether it's busy or not. I would not recommend getting the thai tea as it is really just sugar mixed in a cup for $4. My friend ordered dry curry with rice and I got the pad kee mao, I believe. It was sooooooo heavenly. I honestly dreamt about it last night. I cannot wait to go and try other things. I recall being sceptical about the place because it's not your most fanciest place. You do have to park on the street. I also will not recommend the mango sticky rice, but to each its own. We had the garlic shrimp also, but there wasn't that much shrimp. Overall, I cannot wait to return here again. Only faults were the sticky rice, lack of shrimp and the tea for those prices. Other than that, it's exceptional."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite Thai places outside of the downtown area. The place itself is located in a pretty old plaza. The decor inside is really cute and inviting. The have giant chalkboards and they draw out some of their favorite/popular dishes on their menu. The food itself is well seasoned and extremely flavourful. I usually order their Thai ice tea, it is so refreshing and not overly sweet. I've had their Kao Soi which is one of my favorites there, rich creamy broth with crispy egg noodles and veggies; Pad Thai is made from tamarind paste and all the veggies taste fresh; their holy basil egg is also another favorite, super flavorful and savory meat with slices of cucumber and a fried egg on top. Check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is really good and our go-to for take out and for when we want to order when people are over!  We always get the red curry chicken with coconut rice and the pad thai. The crispy mango chicken is also delicious! I almost forgot, their free dishes when you spend a certain amount are surprisingly awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is one of absolute fav thai places but recently I have found that their takeout is always hit and miss. I don't know why this is.  In the past, we would always be blown away by how saucy their pad thai was (something we always order) but in more recent times, takeout pad thai is not saucy and very dry and also overpoweringly sweet (I have started to wonder if there is a new cook?).  We also always order the friend rice with shrimp and the chicken curry with pineapples.  Both are good but again sometimes, I find them to be a hit and miss when we do take out. One thing I do like is that we get free spring rolls with a minimum purchase. They are actually very yummy especially when eaten right away when they are warm.  Another point I want to make is about their dessert -- the sticky rice.  This could seriously be improved.  Yes having different coloured rice is nice but seriously it is just chewy and nothing special.  I love the milk sauce that comes with it but its just not enough to cover the amount of rice that is given.  We have been regulars for a long time but I just wish that there was some consistency in the food that we order. Suggestions: keep the pad thai saucy and spicy.  Add more flavor to your fried rice - put more shrimp in it and improve the sticky rice dessert!"}
{"text":"Nice n cozy place with good staff providing friendly service. The mango salad was great. Tom yum soup was just OK. Spring rolls were average.  Crispy khans stir fry was good. Pad Lee Mao curry missed the spot with over powering basil."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food that is not the usual fare. The parking lot can get a bit hectic at times but the restaurant is clean and trendy. I had the satay and Pad see ew, both delicious. Definitely worth trying if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Best Thai food I've had since I went to Thailand... It's pretty much comparable. Price is reasonable, service is fantastic and the food is unforgettable."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I have eaten... The place is trying to be hip and trendy... The lighting lacks and u can't see what you are eating.... Got the pad Thai smells really funny and the red curry chicken"}
{"text":"We had take out. We have a new 'favourite of the month'! Lots of flavour...but lots of salt. I'd go there again though! Good price. Good folks at the restaurant. My friend tells me it authentic. My stomach says I should eat more!  It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant twice and food was consistently good. It is comparable to the street style Thai places in downtown Toronto but a little less expensive. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai! Had the pad Thai, it was flavourful and the portion was pretty large. The curries are all delicious but the best is the Penang curry. The price is great and the service is good too. Food comes out quickly and hot. Best Thai in this area!"}
{"text":"Finally a place for good Thai food on the east end!  We had the Tom Yum, Gaeng Masseman (With Potatoes, Tamarind and Peanuts), Pad Thai, and Red Curry with Pineapple.  The favourite dish of the night was the Pad Thai. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and had just the right amount of sauciness. I would have amped up the heat a little, but that's a tiny modification I'm sure they'd we willing to accommodate the next time around.  The Tom Yum was a little too sweet for my taste. The potatoes in the Gaeng Masseman were a tad undercooked. Overall, I think the curries were a little simple in their flavour profile, and could have used more body.  On another note, I wish they would do something about the horrible draft in the place. It was Fuh-reezing! So much so that we kept our coats, scarves, and hats on through the entire meal.  Definitely worth a visit for the food alone! :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend and mom last week for lunch. Me and my gf got the spicy crispy chicken and my mom got the cashew nut chicken. The food was amazing. Came quick, service was great. The guy was friendly. You get this big glass bottle jug type thing for water, which is self serve, which I was totally fine with. It was a bit pricy, but the portion was pretty good for the price, and totally made up for it. Definitely recommend this place and we'd definitely go back again, since its just minutes walking distance from my place!"}
{"text":"Love it! Would not have thought that a restaurant in this unassuming strip mall would serve outstanding Thai! Loved the Paneng curry! Lunch a very nice surprise......pad Thai that doesn't contain ketchup! It's hopping busy....so make a reservation! Great wait staff...helpful...can't say enough. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've always been to the Kingston location before, but this one is somewhat closer! It's hard to get good Thai food in Scarborough, so I was so happy when this opened.  To start, we got satay chicken. Loved how it was marinated, it was juicy and flavourful - the satay sauce that came with it was addicting. The Jatujak Pad Thai was delicious, I'm addicted! The Pad see ew was also good. Dinner portions were fair, price is reasonable. Service was good, staff is friendly and welcoming.  The quality of dishes from both locations was consistent, at least it was whenever I ate there."}
{"text":"I have to regret giving them a 2 star. Their food was very spicy like I wanted and their dish was great. The service killed my experience here. Me and my friend where slowly eating our food and without much detail as I wouldn't know how to describe this scenario that followed - the waiter came over and was removing our plates that we had finished. I clearly said \"I'm still working on it\" and he took not only the finished plates but the dish I was still working on (with more than 50% of the food still left). He must have been thinking of something because he obviously did not pay attention and I just watched in shock as he took our plates away. We sat there laughing thinking of it as a Seinfeld moment. Not returning again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  They have all these weird rules!  The waitress said that I couldn't add shrimp to the lunch portion and I had to pay for the dinner portion.  I asked what the difference was in size, and she said it would be double.  Ummm...it was exactly the same, but what was double was the price.  Then there's 10% discount for cash.  She gave us two bills and said, 10% discount only if you pay for the whole table.  What?  What's the difference?  Ok, so we paid cash for the whole table and got the 10% discount.  The food is delicious is though."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Food was amazing and the customer service was on point. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Straight up, the word to describe this place is \"flavourful\". I only had take out from this place recently and it was great. Had the green curry, the sweet and sour tamarind chicken and a noodle dish i forget what it was.  The amount of food we got would have been good for two and a half days between us it was gone in a day.  I wont deny my gluttony took over because this was good food.   Where i live this is now my go to thai place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the mango chicken. We ordered delivery from here and were throughly impressed. It arrived hot fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after hearing all the good reviews. We ordered a green curry with chicken (mild) and a chicken pad thai (medium). The curry was very creamy and it came with rice. Not enough rice imo, for the amount of curry. Mild was not spicy at all and I think it'd be better with medium spiciness. The pad thai was excellent, it's not sweet like the average pad thai you get and the spiciness was just right.   There were some stir fried dishes and soups on the menu and I'd love to go back and try! Will update this review when I do."}
{"text":"I'm used to one of two kinds of thai places: Tasty, but with overpowering music and shitty lineups, or just mediocre. Jatujak is a breath of fresh air. It's really awesome. Friendly staff, delicious food, and reasonable prices. Also, a total lack of pretension. I recommend it - and I've tried all the Thai places in Toronto. I couldn't stop stuffing my face. Even after I was full."}
{"text":"[4.5 star] Jatujak is my favourite go-to Thai restaurant.  Despite being located in a sketchy strip mall, the restaurant is very clean and beautifully decorated with hand-drawn chalkboard art. Its interior atmosphere is perfect for casual date nights. Don't be fooled by the small storefront as there's another seating area tucked at the back of the restaurant; great for seating larger groups.   Service was good and food was excellent. All main dishes are reasonably priced at around $10-13 (additional $1 or $2 depending on your choice of protein). Very generous with their portions, especially the added protein, for both dine-in and take-out orders.   - Both the Geang Kiew Whan (green curry) and the Geang Karee (yellow curry) was rich in flavour and packed with protein and veggies. All curry comes with steamed jasmine rice. I would definately recommend the green curry if you like the extra kick of heat.   - The chicken Pad Thai is very standard, but is cooked very well. It has a balanced, sweet yet tangy flavour. Noodles were not overcooked and had a nice bounce.   - Mango salad is served on a crispy shell-like chip. This dish is very tasty and refreshing. Although already near perfect, I'd prefer no raw onions and cilantro added in the salad.    - The yellow curry used in the chicken Khao Soi is delicious and flavourful. However, unlike other resraurants, there was significantly more protein served in comparison to the egg noodle.   - Thai iced tea is served in a cute mason jar. As usual, too sweet for my liking.   - The mango sticky rice dessert is served warm, and often in a heart shape. The tri-colour sticky rice (no difference in taste) and mango is topped with toasted sesame seeds, and is paired with a not overly sweet syrup. This dessert is definitely a must try becuase it is both delicious and picture worthy.   I would definitely recommend Jatujak, a Scarborough hidden gem."}
{"text":"Ordered take out several times but this was the first time dining in.  I feel that over time, the quality? of the food has gone down hill and considering it is quite pricey.  One of my favourite dish was the gaeng masaman with beef but not so anymore. The beef is very, very chewy.  It needs to be cooked longer to be more tender. The green curry chicken (gaeng kiew whan) has way too much bamboo shoot and not enough chicken.  The pad Thai is very good.  Service was good and were very attentive."}
{"text":"Best thai place in the city. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Best things: green curry, pad thai, red curry, broccoli with beef and mango salad. Vegetable cold rolls are great too. Awesome services and discount if you use cash."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, had dinner there with my wife.  Great food and service!  It's a small establishment, so it can get crowded.  Seats about 20 people.  They have take out as well.  We had the pad thai chicken and the green curry chicken.  Both dishes were excellent!  Top marks for this place.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Hard to find good thai in Scarborough.  This place is a gem!  Ordered the pad thai, green curry chicken, pepper beef.  Each dish was fantastic!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This review is for the branch on Kingston.  Food- absolutely amazing! Especially their tom yam soup.   Place- clean.  Staff- friendly and accommodating.  Summary- it's a must!"}
{"text":"Even though this place was packed during lunch time, the service was surprisingly fast and friendly! Ordered the lunch specials for the 3 of us which included the pad thai, basil chicken, and curry chicken.   Portion sizes were decent, and we were unable to finish everything. My favourite of the 3 was definitely the curry chicken. The sauce was so good! Took home the leftovers just so I could have it with plain rice. I also ordered the thai milk tea. It was a tad on the sweeter side but still really delicious.   I can't wait to come back to try the other curries."}
{"text":"I'll give a general review consisting of pros and cons about Jatujak. The food was great and flavourful, the place gave a cozy feel sort of like a coffee shop consisting of the wooden tables, high chairs and interiors let alone the chalk board decorated with cute illustrations. The service though was pretty slow due to the fact that there was only one lady who was serving our food. Ordering was a bit of a 50/50 shot because the menu had no pictures so you don't really have a general understanding of what your getting, but in  the end it was a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Even though everybody here is giving them good reviews, I was not so impressed. The place was spacious. I think their service was slow and staff were unfriendly. Only when we paid, the waitress was smiling.  their foods were too spicy. Only one thing I like about them was painting in another big room."}
{"text":"my sister and i took my mom here for her birthday and this place is a gem!! typically with scarborough restaurants, you think hole in the wall spot with good food, and this is just that! As soon as we stepped in we were totally surprised. the interior decor and art work is so inviting, alomost has a queen west type of feel. the food was awesome, prices were fair. the service was kinda crappy. the restaurant wasnt busy at all when we went, just my family and one other couple, but the employees were just sitting at a table of their own chatting it up. we always had to interrupt them or wave them down to get water and napkins. i disliked that they didnt check in with us during our meal to see if we needed anything. aside from that i really liked the place, i would definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I was brought here by coworkers.  I've lived in the area for years and years and I've never seen this place before.  It's hidden in an ugly little strip mall, but it's a complete treasure.  This will be some of the best Thai food in the city if you're not extremely picky.  I've seen some complaints here from people who claim it's overhyped, but I wonder if it's fair to judge this place so harshly.  Their food is VERY good compared to almost all the other Thai food I've had in the city, but you also have to consider that it's relatively cheap as well.  The value you get for the price is exceptional.  I really do recommend it if you're looking for some yummy thai on a budget - and in an area not known for it's thai cuisine.  My only complaint is that the chairs at the table are not very comfortable - they almost look like metal patio chairs.  Other than that, all good.  I've had their pad thai (which is delicious - more of a satay pad thai than the horrible shit you normally get in the city that tastes like it's half ketchup) as well as the curry, which is really yummy and made properly with coconut milk (instead of the watery kind you can get sometimes).  I'm definitely a fan and plan to come back very, very often!"}
{"text":"It's a really nice place. Small, warm, welcoming. I ordered the Gaeng Masaman (beef) and it was exceptional. The staff is very accompdating.   Also, if you check in with yelp, you get a free iced tea.  Highly, highly recommend this place. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times so wanted to confirm it's consistency; their bang on! The entrance has someone quickly greeting you and seats you promptly according to number of people you are with, and shows up with the menu. Their space and seating is very limited 8-10 tables and can be moved into larger tables as their individual tables. It's store front facing Kingston rd and parking is on the street! My group ordered Thai Ice tea; spring roles; chicken Satay; green curry that's served with steam rice; holy basil Beef( served with sunny side up egg). Each app and meals came freshly made and spice level you should mention to them yourself . The (holy basil) came pickle pepper on the side and (satay chicken) with peanut sauce. Service and food meets their grading! Pricey but based on freshness worth $60 to feed 3-4."}
{"text":"A cute tiny restaurant located on Kingston road in Scarborough. Once you enter the restaurant you are faced with the take out order counter, and on the right there are about 5 tables of 4 seater if you fancy for a sit down meal. There is one washroom that is relatively clean.   The service is standard, but the food is quite good. You know you are eating real Thai food when you can taste the tamarind in the pad Thai.  As for the price it is standard, e.g a plain pad Thai is $9.95, but to add chicken or beef it cost additional  $2 and $3 for shrimp."}
{"text":"Stomach ache from burnt food. shouldn't have eaten it but I felt too awkward to complain because of how bad the food actually was.  I had ordered their cashew beef dish for a little change-up as I usually order cashew chicken when I eat at thai restaurants. the beef tasted a lot like it was cooked in old/used cooking oil, and it honestly might have even been re-cooked. the flavour itself just tasted burnt, and then the meat itself actually was overcooked right to the core. the meat was essentially dried out, and very hard to chew. The flavour of the sauce wasn't that great either, it might have been too sweet? The peppers and other veggies were cooked very poorly too. they were squishy on the edges, and hard to the center.  This meal was eaten back in August. hopefully some changes have been made since. Haven't been back since this meal."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in Scarborough.  Not a big fan if the pad Thai but all other dishes are to die for. Highly recommend this place if you live are in the east end. Oh and get the mango stick rice for dessert too."}
{"text":"I stopped here randomly because I saw the \"street style Thai food\" sign and saw that it received 4 stars from Yelp.   I had the beef pad Thai a few minutes ago. And well. I had to force myself to eat half the plate. I now feel sick. I'm sure it's all in my head. Regardless this dish was really bad. The need was super hard and the noodles felt like someone had mixed noodles and pre made sauce. It was super saturated. Not at all what yould get on the street.   If you want good Thai food go to khan san road or sukhothai."}
{"text":"This is a very busy restaurant with great food and staff.  Tried the Gaeng Kiew Whan, the waiter recommended to have this dish as a beef dish and it didn't disappoint, there was plenty of beef and veg and the sauce was very aromatic. The Pad Woon Sen was a little salty and not as interesting as the Gaeng Kiew Whan.  Although we only tried two dishes the different plates  coming out of the kitchen were beautiful and have enticed me to visit again and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Jatujak at VP is a great thai place that is not DT. Their food is not as great as Pai or Khao San Road but is definitely better than most thai restaurants outside the city. One thing I'll say is this - their thai iced tea is comparable to Pai, KSR and even thai restaurants in California. I'm really glad that my gf lives 2 min away. Thai iced tea to go whenever I want!"}
{"text":"First time I've ever used Yelp but I felt compelled to write that this by far the best Thai food I have ever had. One of my top 5 places to eat in Toronto. You can't go wrong here and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after hearing about this place as a hole in the wall gem, overall it was a good experience. Not sure if I would go out of my way for it, I would come if I was in the area.   My favorite of the night was the Pad kee Mao. Very well done. Rice noodles were stir fried just right, none of them clinged to each other.   Also really enjoyed their green curry, gaeng kiew whan. It's more watery than Khao San road but the flavors were spot on. They'll make it less spicy if you ask.    The Holy basil with egg was mediocre and I found the flavours to be bland.   We also ordered the Tom kha soup. It was a very interesting mix of citrus based creamy soup.  Worth a try.   This place is worth a try. Top choice in the area."}
{"text":"We have dined in and done take out multiple times. This place consistently serves great food. We love to order their pad thai and their curries. Their mango salad is also really good! Service is quick and ordering food over the phone is always easy. I have no complaints about this place. So glad we have a new go to Thai place!"}
{"text":"We've tried both Jatujak's locations now and find them about the same in terms of the food quality.  The chicken wings and the pad thai are a bit too sweet for my liking, and the beef and chicken skewers are smothered in this creamy sauce that just doesn't go well with the peanut dipping sauce.  Pineapple fried rice is decent as well as the spicy beef salad.  Curry was a bit watery and the beef in it was just ok.  Overall while it's ok thai food for Toronto, still not the high quality authentic stuff that I can get whenever I venture down south of the border."}
{"text":"I love this place! it's super cute and trendy - the drawings on the chalkboard wall are adorable. I came here by recommendation and I'm super glad I did! pretty fast service and the staff is friendly! every time I'm craving Thai food, this place is always my go-to, whether it be sit down or take out. I always get the lunch special and I get the veggie pad thai (you can also choose which spice level you'd like!)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Thai food, you have come to the right place! This place has it all!   The food is tasty and well seasoned. There's not ONE thing I wouldn't recommend on the menu, but my favourites are the noodle pad kee Mao and the gaeng phed!   Delivery is free If the order is above $20. And they used to offer free spring rolls if your order was above $30 or a mango salad for above $40."}
{"text":"This spot has the best pad Thai ever! Ive tried pad Thai from so many restaurants and I always end up always going back to jatujak. Once you've tried pad Thai from this place, pad Thai from somewhere will never be the same and it will never compare to jatujaks. The pad Thai is cooked with tamarind sauce instead of ketchup. It's just so tasty  and they give you so much food for the price you pay! This is always my go to place whenever I'm craving for pad Thai."}
{"text":"Wow what a good Thai place in Scarborough!   I have eaten here at least three times, and have been pleased everytime. On my last visit, I ordered the potato curry puffs which were delicious balls of lightly curried potato stuffed in flaky pastry shell. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao lunch special, which was extremely reasonable in price and very generous in size. It comes with a side salad, spring roll and drink for 8$. The pad kee mao is a spicy dish of flat rice noodles with veggies and tofu stir fried in a basil sauce and it was soooo good! I will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Usually don't like Thai food in Toronto too much. This place will be the first exception"}
{"text":"This is my local go-to street-style thai spot. Their mango chicken dish is just perfect. Love the portions. All of their food from the pad thais to the curry is great. Can't go wrong, and good decor. A bit of a strange spot but who cares - you don't go there for the location - you go there for the genuinely good food."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here five times. Enjoy the food quite a bit. Only downside is the delivery wait time can sometimes get upwards to 2 hours and the delivery guy still insists on a tip. Rude."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for our group to grab dinner and it was a good choice.   The food is really well and well priced. I loved their green curry!   Pad Thai is sweeter than most places which I wasn't a fan of.   The mango salad was interesting lol, most people loved it and it was okay for me  Overall the dishes were good, we mainly choose the ones that had the thumbs up beside it.   Service wise.... It was a bit slow. They kind of ignored us when we tried to wave them down and it took forever to get the cheque and take out boxes. It wasn't that busy that night either"}
{"text":"Penang curry is flavourful and my fave dish at Jatujak.  Though beware: even without adding spice, it might be considered spicy for diners that prefer mild / no spice.  The pad Thai was delicious at first bite, but becomes increasingly overly sweet by the midway point of finishing the plate.  Mango salad is large enough to serve 3 people as an appetizer.  The mango rice dessert is served as little mounds of multi-coloured rice, topped with mango halves, sitting beside little metal cups of coconut cream.  The colourful rice doesn't taste any different from usual white rice, but it makes it Instagram-worthy.  All in all, A-OK!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Restaurant in Toronto , very close to dishes that I have tried in Bangkok ,"}
{"text":"We came here last night for our Friday night supper. I really, really wanted to be a fan...but Jatujak didn't blow me away.   THE GOOD: - Prices were fair for what we ordered. Our main dishes were $9-11 each, and domestic beers were $4.50. - Surprise, surprise - they have free WiFi! I'm in the market for a new cell phone plan right now and don't have data, so this was icing on the cake.   THE BAD: - Yelp's 3-star description above summarizes this food best: A-OK. Yes, it was tasty, but it didn't knock my socks off. We went with Green Curry Beef and Chicken Fried Rice. I wasn't a fan of the tomato in my fried rice, and I thought the curry was lacking in beef.  - The portions were also on the small side. If you want excellent Thai food with some serious portions, venture over to East York and check out Thai Room (Danforth and Woodbine).  Personally, I think this place is overhyped and I wouldn't return - there is far better Thai food in this city."}
{"text":"We waited forever for delivery. They said 1 hour but it was way more than that. They were rude when we called to enquire about the delay."}
{"text":"Always fresh and hot. Vegetable fresh rolls have a hint of mint which is always refreshing served with peanut sauce"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems of Scarborough. This place is very hip, great decor, very cozy family feels, surprisingly large back room, can fit large parties. Well priced, good portions, love the layout.  $7.95 - Pad Kee Mao (RECOMMEND). Thicker noodle, bit salty but flavorful. Spicy definitely quite a nice kick  $9.95 - Pad Ka Pal. Thai basil (RECOMMEND). Veggies curry, get with beef and a bowl of rice. Very spicy with nice rich basil flavour.   $7.95 - Curry Chicken. Authentic but pretty standard curry. Really good but trying the other dishes might be a better experience  $7.95 - Pad Thai (RECOMMEND). Pretty standard pad Thai but they do it very well. Worth getting!   $3 - Thai milk tea! Definitely get to try out, tastes great and comes in a Maison jar to appeal to the basics."}
{"text":"For the curry puffs alone! So flaky and warm and all things yummy! I ate it before I could take a picture and show you all so you will just have to see with your stomachs!   Tried and true: mango salad (I think it's the fish flakes that kick this dish up a notch!); pad Thai (doesn't taste ketchup-y)"}
{"text":"My first time being here. Once you walk in, completely different than what you would have expected. It was nice inside. Clean, and cozy. Quite a lot of tables. They also have a seperate room at the back with more seats. The staff were all very nice and friendly!   We ordered the Jatujak Pad Thai & Pad Kee Mao. The flavours of both were great. I loved how the noodles didn't just break apart when you bit into it. It was chewy, which I liked. For someone like me who can't handle spice, the Pad Kee Mao is too spicy for me. You have a choice of adding either chicken, beef or shrimp to your dish for an extra charge.   For dessert we got the Mango Sticky Rice. I've never tried mango sticky rice before and really wanted to try it after reading some reviews on it on yelp. Almost all the reviews are pretty positive. It was good. But a little too sweet for my liking. It's perfect to share with others, a few bites each.   Overall, it's a pretty good place for thai food. I would come back if i'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through yelp, I was contacted about 10 mins later to confirm. I had to change it again the next day by adding 2 more people and didn't have a problem! Great authentic Thai food ! Will be back"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down. Last few times I went the vegetables in pad Thai didn't taste fresh. Tofu had a weird dish washing detergent taste / freeze burn. Tomato in the sauce was over powering. Curry tasted bland. Will not be returning considering this happened multiple times and it was not a one time thing."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Recently, I tried spicy crispy chicken and the pad thai. Both were very flavorful. Last time, I had panang curry with rice, which was great too. The food is not as good as Khao San Road/Pai, but it's one of the best in the area. So, if you don't want to plan a special trip to downtown, you could satisfy your Thai food cravings here.  We went here at lunch both times, so the place was packed and service was lukewarm as they only had one server who was handling cash too. They could be a little more attentive/staff appropriately.  More like 3.5 stars than 4."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and we got the Thai ice tea, chicken khao soi and beef pad thai.  Honestly, the food is alright at best, the reviews really hyped this place up. The khao soi is good, the flavours are there (mostly) but seemed waterier than other ones I've had. The noodle was clumped together so had to be separated before eating and obviously I made a mess (sorry!). The pad Thai was okay but expensive $9 for just straight noodles and if you wanted to add protein it's an extra $2.. isn't it supposed to come with a protein?  Atmosphere was good, quiet enough to have a conversation and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered padthai, tom yum and garlic shrimp at vp & surrey branch and it was good,garlic shrimp wasnot overcook, therice was good too, quick service and nice ambience. The tom yum is veru tasty,padthai is not the best but better than other places for sure. Will definitely coeack and i recommend this place for those quick lunch/dinner fix"}
{"text":"Decided to pop in here as i was craving a Thai iced-tea and well, food went hand in hand with it.  Decided to order two separate dishes, a curry and a pad thai and both were delicious. The serving was the perfect size and the peanut sauce on the side was even better.  The curry could have had a little bit more flavour/spice to it but other than that it was good!  Definitely recommend the Thai iced-tea it was once of the best i have had!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Thai place close to my house and I found Jatujak through Google search. I ordered Khao Soi for take out and it was super delicious!! I couldn't finish all of it at once as the the portion is quite big. Really satisfied with the food and I will definitely go there again with family and friends. Bonus:  It's Halal."}
{"text":"Very quaint place. Staff was not bothersome but always ready and available when they were required. They let us hang out without pestering us to leave after we were done out meal and continued bringing us water. I had the Pad Kee Mao. Was absolutely delicious. This dish is actually spicy if you're not too used to spice but they do adjust the spiciness based on what you want. The variety of flavours aren't drowned out in how spicy the food is however. I also had the chicken satay. It was pretty much what you'd expect - not something to go to for specifically but not something you'd regret ordering. My friend had the green curry. There was a good sauce to rice ratio. There wasn't any leftover rice or leftover sauce. The portion of food is good too. Not so much you need to take food home or feel ridiculously bloated or not so little that you feel like you're wanting more. The price was good for what we got. Very fair overall and a place I would recommend going to and would go back to as well!"}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant was a wonderful surprise. I came with my parents and brother. We found parking and then a table for four right away, and ordered:  - Pad thai with chicken, spicy: absolutely delicious. Almost as good, if not as good as, my favourite pad thai at Sukho Thai. It hit the perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty and spicy. - Pad kee mao with beef, spicy: also delicious. Noodles were perfect texture, was garlicky and flavourful. - Thai fried rice with shrimp, spicy: very good, though not quite as flavourful as Sukho Thai. It came with five large shrimps. - Green curry with chicken, spicy: really delicious. The coconut curry was bursting with flavour from the kaffir lime leaves. - Thai iced tea: very good, a wonderful creamy drink with lots of flavour from the black tea. Only complaint is too much ice, it made the drink a bit watery. - Tapioca coconut pudding: this was a miss for me. My family enjoyed it more than I did. It was sweet and salty, which didn't appeal to me, and had pistachios and honeydew in it.   I've been a huge fan of Sukho Thai and Pai for years, but it's always a struggle to bring my family there because it's impossible to find parking, and there's usually a wait for a table. This wasn't an issue at Jatujak, the pricing was about the same, the food was excellent, the meat was halal, service was great, and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I'm so glad we found this hidden gem and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, reasonable prices. Thai iced tea was delicious as was the pineapple fried rice and green curry. Pad thai was a tad over-sweet. Overall a great choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Oh man I love Jatujak. Their pad kee mao is the first thing that comes to mind anytime there's talk of ordering food. I'm addicted. The noodles are spicy(!!), perfectly cooked and beautifully seasoned with lots of basil. I haven't had any of their other main dishes but their mango salad is superb. Definitely our go-to Thai place. Delivery is very quick."}
{"text":"We came here last night as we were craving thai food and  overall it was alright. We ordered pad thai, chicken satay, curry chicken and tom yum soup. The pad thai tasted a bit weird.. it tasted a bit tangy (I've had pad thai at other restaurants and it doesn't taste like this). Tom yum was alright, not sure why the texture of the soup was grainy. Chicken satay was delicious, as well as their curry \"gaeng masaman\". My favorite was the curry. Very flavourful and addicting. Would come back for that dish.  Overall I would give this place a solid 3/5. It seems that they are understaffed as we had to get up a few times to get their attention. They are very fair on their pricing though, their dishes are larger than the standard imo."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets! I can eat their food with my eyes closed and I am transported back to Bangkok, Absolutely love the dishes here. I ate it at the restaurant and still had plenty for takeaway at the end of the meal. I cant say enough here about how I enjoyed the food, except if you want the authentic experience outside of Thailand, this is where you need to come!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Thai places in Toronto. Khao soi was warm, flavourful and addictive! Their mango sticky rice was also surprisingly good! They certainly did not skimp out on their skewers either. Reasonable pricing and great portions! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've just come back from a great supper at Jatujak.  Tiny place but nice people, good service, and really good food, and a bargain price.  They must be doing something right, because there was a line-up for take-out all the way out the door.  Thanks Yelp for pointing us here - we'll be back."}
{"text":"We had the Asia Food Fest prefix course. It wasn't worth it (there was no discount, and no special dishes that aren't on the regular menu).  The spring rolls are whatever (your average oily take-out spring rolls), the coconut soup was meh, the green curry was very oily. The pad Thai was good, but a bit over-seasoned for me, and oilier than most pad Thai I've tried.  Then we ordered dessert (not part of the prefix). The mango sticky rice was good, but the sticky rice color balls were bad (and pricey, you could get a whole box for that price).  If you do come here, I'd say the lunch is better value than the Asia food fest menu."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the scarborough area !! Love the food and service here :)  We had the monthly special - steam fish curry , green curry with beef, and tom kha soup.  Thai iced tea and Thai green tea were both very good.. And how can we forget the mango sticky rice !!!  It's the best mango sticky rice i have tried in Toronto :)  Must visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Location/Service The restaurant is located along Victoria Park, south of Lawrence. It's in a very small strip plaza (so watch out!) with small amount of parking space available. Outside looks small, but it's pretty spacious inside (probably can fit 50 people or so). Decor is mostly a wooden theme - cozy and homey feeling to it. Service is also great - staff were nice, friendly and quick with orders.  Food Came here for lunch - so was only able to try their lunch specials, which is around $8.95. I chose garlic shrimp and it comes with steamed rice. Shrimps were large in size and rich in garlic flavor. There's a sweet sauce added to the dish, which blends well with the vegetables and adding an extra kick for the rice (the sauce was a little overkill though).   Also ordered a Thai Iced Tea (around $3.95) - which was fabulous! Love the distinct layers of milk and tea, which combined is not overly sweet and the tea is very smooth and bold.   Overall pretty good place for lunch - would love to come back and try their dinner menu or their curry next time."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for about a year. At first we really liked this place but it is TOTALLY INCONSISTENT! It's very frustrating. I usually try something different but my partner gets the same thing every time and every time it's different. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it was always good, but it's not.  Last night we both got the same thing. Both dishes had no sauce were totally underseasoned and the noodles overcooked. The only difference was his was beef and mine was veggies and tofu. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"As not being much of a fan of thai, this place really hits the spot! A great place for thai in Scarborough. Their thai iced tea is fantastic and their chicken pad thai was also great. The restaurant itself has two sections, so though at first it may seem small, there's actually more space than you think. Also, great service, would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spring rolls. Certainly not the best I have had and was left feeling very uncomfortable, nauseous, all night. Am a still feeling dehydrated. Will not support this local eatery again."}
{"text":"Jatujak is a mid-town Scarborough Thai restaurant located in a small plaza that's easy to pass by unnoticed. If you are heading south on Victoria Park, it's almost an immediate right turn after Sweeney Drive.  This restaurant is not big so making reservations might be beneficial, but you can also walk in casually, just expect to wait a bit especially if you have a large group. We came on a Saturday night once as a group of 4 and 90% of the tables had a reserve sign on. Thankfully my friends worked their magic to somehow secure a table.  Compare to downtown Thai restaurants, I enjoyed Jatujak very much. Their portion size and flavours were great. Its hard to find good Thai cuisine nowadays.  My boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken (+$1). Personally, I thought it was super delicious with a hint of sweetness and sourness together. I can't describe how delicious it was. Too bad it wasn't my order. However, my BF felt the Pad Thai had less fish sauce flavour than needed.  As for my dish, I had the Khao Soi with Chicken and asked for less spicy. The noodles were great and the served amount was perfect, unlike some places that gave less noodles yet with a big bowl of soup. The sauce is awesome too - not too thick, spice level mild and just right, and the aroma was fantastic. I did notice there were a lot of onions cooked in this Khao Soi, not sure if it's like that or they added it to make it more original. Overall, I thought the chicken meat was least satisfying. It was decent and thinly sliced but nothing special.  Another dish our group ordered was a curry masan. The sauce was different than your typical curry or the Khao Soi. It was really tasty and interestingly, I noticed they filled the rice bowl to the max, almost spilling the sauce inside.  Just to fill my taste buds with more Thai flavour, I ordered the Nom Ye green milk (thinking it was Thai-styled iced tea). It tasted like Melona Popsicles haha. It was another visit that I finally tried their iced tea and it was refreshing!  Come dessert time, we ordered the Mango Sticky Rice which was really well done. The presentation was excellent being multicolored. Although different  in colour, they all taste identical - the warmth and sweetness, accompanied with just the right amount of syrup. Likewise, the mango wasn't sour yet everything on the plate was chewy.  In general, Jatujak service was good. The waitress was smiling and kind, and she also helped take a group picture for us amidst the busyness. They refilled the water jar consistently and didn't rush us to pay or leave either."}
{"text":"Food is good but mostly it's a really cute restaurant, and the lady that works there is really nice :)"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout via Ubereats. Good food. Reasonably priced. We had fresh spring rolls, green curry and mango salad. All were fresh and delicious. I would definitely order from this place again."}
{"text":"had the pad see ew and basil chicken lunch special as part of the uber eats. was quite tasty and portion size was just right. i haven't had the chance to visit the actual restaurant yet..which i definitely think would be tastier fresh"}
{"text":"What a great find when we happened to be around the area.   Ambience: Moderately sized dining area and a inner room in the back with more decors. But the dining area is nice to sit in.   Food: We looooved all the food we ordered. We had lemongrass chicken wings (asked for sauce on the side and was able to accommodate). The Tom yum soup with shrimp was very tasty and well blended flavours. Jus the right amount of ingredients in the soup. We ordered a Pad Kee Mao (hot and spicy stir fry noodles with egg, +beef); and Gaeng Phed curry +chicken. Everything has its own flavour and texture. The rice noodles were so soft and cooked just right. The curry is a bit on the watery side but tastes very good. Good portion and had leftover. We ordered the mango sticky rice for dessert and I wish I could have 2!   Overall a great last minute search experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but service was hit or miss. One of the servers, was really nice and friendly, while the other one was rude, impatient and impersonal.   No matter how great the food or one server is, it's hard to get the sour taste of crappy service of your mouth.   At first I wasn't going to recommend this restaurant, but after talking to the owner, I've changed my opinion.   He explained that the one server is still learning and still has a ways to go. He was a very nice guy and understood my concerns, and appreciated my comments.  He agreed that Toronto has many great food establishments, and customer service goes a long way.    I will definitely have to go back here another day and see how the service is next time. Hopefully the learning curve will be over by then and I can give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Although, their Kingston establishment is small but the quality and taste of the food is too good to handle. This location also serves Halal. I would rate this place better than Sukho Thai. Jutajak is price effective as well. Their Beef Salad, Spicy Crispy Chicken is simply awesome. The salad is juicy and full of street flavours. If we ignore the ambience of the restaurant, they are one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"This cute restaurant decorated with this Modern Thai Flare serves out delicious dishes and good service.  Usually, I judge Thai restaurants with staples, like chicken satay, pad thai, red curry. This time, I decided to venture out into the Kao Soi - which as other reviewers have mentioned is the BOMB DIGGITY. So good, so flavourful.  The Thai iced tea was also amazing - perfectly sweetened!  I did get to try a bit of the pad thai and massaman curry for take out on an other occasion, and I'd have to say - portion sizes were generous. And the flavour was jam packed. Yum. I'm getting hungry writing this right now.  Seriously, forget taking TTC/ GO bus or whatever you do to go downtown for your next Thai fix. Find it here. It's quality Thai food you won't regret. Good for vegetarians and meat eaters - with plenty of options!"}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to try our this little Thai place and I am only upset that I did not find it sooner.  I walked in to order, lots of parking on Kingston Rd. Attentive counter staff took my order. Sat in some nice comfy chairs and food was done well ahead of schedule.  Not the cheapest menu I have seen, but as we found out later it was well worth it. Also not the most extensive menu at a Thai restaurant, but in this case it worked well.  We had  Coconut Chicken Soup - Spiced just right, nice and rich with lots of chicken, galangal (sp?) and veggies  Spring Rolls - were not too greasy and packed full!  Pad Thai was excellent. Noodle and veg were cooked perfectly, sauce was not too sweet and the chicken was excellent.  All in all a very good experience. I hope this place stays around longer than the other places in this location."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai foods. Place is cozy and nice. Gotta come back to try  the different dish."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Authentic Thai restaurant with casual decor serving up street style Thai food.   Came here for lunch and ordered their Pad Thai and Red Panang Beef curry. Everything was cooked perfectly with great depths of flavour that satisfies your taste buds.  Service was attentive and the food came out at lightning speeds. Definitely found this place more favourable than its downtown counterparts."}
{"text":"I rarely come to this area so I never thought I'd get to try this restaurant.  I saw it while passing by and thought, I'm just gonna go!    I had a lunch special with the $3 add on (I really enjoyed my ginger tea).  The dressing on the salad was a little heavy handed and spread to my spring roll.  Boooo.    My rice noodles were great!  Full flavours and definitely reminded me of Thailand.  I asked for spicy and they did not disappoint.  I will admit, I wasn't too fond of having to pick out the pieces kaffir lime leaves but they certainly added to the taste.    Overall, a nice uptown option for Thai."}
{"text":"What a pleasant little surprise this was.  I had the Pad Kee Mao which had a lovely basil/lime flavour, but I was my girlfriends dish that was to die for. She had the Gaeng Panang with a super rich and creamy coconut curry sauce. She was embarrassed by me busting out my iPhone to take pictures of food in public so wasn't able to photo her dish. Once we were seated, I fired up Yelp and checked in here to be greeted with a digital Yelp coupon on my iPhone for a free Thai iced tea which sort of reminded me of orange creamsicle.  Super friendly staff and a quaint atmosphere.   This place will definitely be one of my new favourites."}
{"text":"First tried the Kingston road location. Blown away.  Drove on Victoria park the other day and saw they had another location. Decided to give it a try today. The strip mall its located in is kind of grotty. But dont worry, the restaurant inside is clean with modern decor. We had the panang as well as the kwei whan. Absolutely fantastic. Best Thai food I've ever eaten in Toronto. Give it a try. It won't disappoint. :)"}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from here. I was glad to see that the previous Thai restaurant was replaced with a new Thai option for delivery in the area so thought I'd give it a try. Overall I'll definitely order from here from now on but it's not the best I've ever had.   The food was above average for sure, very yummy. We ordered the Khoa Soi Beef was very rich and creamy and generally had good flavour but wasn't as complex a flavour (like it had been simmering for a day) the way I've had before. We also had the Gaeng  kiew whan (green curry) which again was nicely rich and creamy but not as full a flavour as i've had before. The Eggplant delight with tofu was exactly as described and had a good sauce. The Pad Thai was certainly not the best but acceptable. We got free spring rolls and cold rolls which was nice but nothing mind blowing. Overall the food was very good with the exact right spice I think (hot but not a \"on fire\" or burning feeling which is never good ;) ), especially for delivery. The prices were good about $10 per main which seems totally reasonable.    However the online ordering system didn't work because apparently my M1K postal code isn't in their system even though I am well within the mapped delivery area on their menu/website. When we then (after going through the whole online ordering process) called to order he also questioned our location so I think they need to work on that. Also the delivery was late, by just less then 10 min but considering they had said an hour it felt like forever late because it just generally took a long time. But in terms of delivery the worse part was that they didn't follow the instructions given (we live in the basement apartment and asked them to come knock on the side door but instead the rang the front door's bell).  So overall good food, bad delivery. I hope they improve and work out some of the delivery kinks but I'll certainly order again or perhaps order for pick up in the future."}
{"text":"Finally a good Thai option in the Borough. They have a straight forward Thai menu consisting of appetizers, stir-frys, noodles, and curries. Adhering to the advice from many yelpers regarding the ample food servings, I've managed, with great difficulty, to not overdo the ordering.  The Thai Lemon Iced tea and the Thai Green Tea Milk Tea are light and refreshing - perfect summer bevvys that compliment the meal really well.  If it's your first time I would recommend the Panang curry with chicken - I've fallen in love with it. They will adjust the spice level according to your taste. I would say the dish is adequate for 3 - 4 people based on hunger level, and is prepared with a good amount of chicken and veggies. It comes with rice on the side. The only other dish I've tried here is the Pad Kee Mao (?) which is a spicy stir fried noodle dish - I'm not a big fan of noodles but my friend loved it. The spice packs quite a punch - again large portion that's good for 3 - 4 people.  The place really picks up in the evening and if you're bringing a larger group, which they are able to accommodate, I would suggest making reservations.  In terms of price range, you're looking at $10 - $13 per main dish. Great service here as well, the food is always promptly served and they never rush you even as the place starts to fill up."}
{"text":"Delicious! Our new go-to take out place in the area! We have ordered 3 times now, different dishes each time, and every one has been tasty and well prepared. It is not a place to dine-in (yet). An authentic Thai experience."}
{"text":"We ordered fish yellow curry after we saw the photos  posted by other yelpers, it sure didn't disappoint. Taste was balanced, a bit spicy, but the heat balances the creaminess and sweetness of the coconut milk. The quantity of the big succulent pieces of fish was amazing. Also ordered Pad Thai, I like that it's not the fake North American ketchup Pad Thai, and it's a lot less sweet than the usual Thai eateries. but I'd still appreciate if it's even less sweet.  We ate in, the service was very nice. Very glad we found this place, will sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best thai in toronto I agreed. We went there due to yelp reviews and we werent disappointed. Decor has cool vibe, very unique and feels like more intimate. Even though they were busy since they had a long table of wedding reception or Im not sure,the wait times are not bad at all.  I'll recommend the food that we got based on the suggestions here.   Mango Salad:a must, very tasty. My boyfriend never really tried one but he loved it from the start. Shrimp chips: nice to share as an appetizer, my bf was munching on it like chips, the peanut sauce was a nice touch Pad thai:with chicken and shrimps was amazing as well. but better skip the shrimp since they only add 4 shrimp for more $$.  Crispy mango chicken: is a good main that comes with rice. Flavor was great.  Service: is amazing, considering that they were so packed but the servers were still attentive and prompt, including the kitchen. We didnt really have to wait long for the food to come out.   This place embodies quality and authentic thai food with amazing customer service. Well definitely come back as this will be our thai place to-go-to and will recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Jatujak is one of my favourite Thai places to go to in the city.  It's located in a peculiar location: A strip mall just south of Lawrence and Victoria Park.  Despite this, once inside, you are welcomed into a quaint and decently spacious restaurant serving up some tasty and authentic Thai dishes.  I've frequented Jatujak a number of times now and have tried their Mango Salad, Chicken Pad Thai, Khao Soi, Gaeng Masaman, Mango Sticky Rice, and Thai Iced Tea.   The mango salad is served with red onions, cilantro, peppers, and a tangy vinagrette atop a crispy chip that kind of resembles a shrimp cracker.  Very appetizing and especially good when mangoes are in season.  The chicken pad thai is sweet, salty, and tangy.  Just exactly what pad thai should taste like, at least to a westernized palette like mine.  Well-balanced portion of protein, noodles, bean sprouts, and peanuts.  Not too saucy and not too dry.  If chicken is not your flavour, there are other options for protein, such as beef, shrimp, etc...  The Khao soi features crispy egg noodles in a rich yellow curry with your choice of protein.  Very hearty and flavourful.  The Gaeng Masaman features a delicious curry with peanut, taramind sauce and onions with your choice of protein.  I had the beef to go with it and it was very good and filling.  The mango sticky rice had a very nice, colourful presentation.  A must try and a perfect ending to a hearty meal.  Not too sweet, and a very pleasant texture.  Finally, the Thai iced tea was good and refreshing.  It was a tad on the sweet side, though.  All was prepared fresh and delicious.  For the price-point, it is definitely well worth it considering its downtown rivals cost more and offer longer wait times and poorer service."}
{"text":"Love this place. Especially the basil spicy noodle, yellow curry chicken, and beef pad siew.   If you get there mango sticky rice make sure to ask for the plain white rice; otherwise they have started using a strange artificial banana flavour multicoloured rice which we don't like (think: Popeyes candy cigarettes).   The people are friendly and their delivery and takeout is fantastic."}
{"text":"Plus: good attempt to have a decent Thai food place on Vic Park. Almost pull off downtown or Queen St. vibe.   However, if you are in a strip mall on Vic Park, and charging downtown prices, then you quality and ambience must also be on par.  This was ok. All dishes were too sweet."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday for dinner. I'm not a local here, first time having Thai food in Canada. The food was alright. I ordered the flat stir fried noodles and Tom yum soup. Severs were very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Thai food in Toronto, beating out both Pai and Khao San Road.   The location could be tricky to get to if you don't live close or in the immediate area and don't have a car; the restaurant is not really ideal for dine-in as there are only a few tables. I suggest getting take out (pick up) or delivery and enjoying this mouthwatering authentic Thai cuisine from the comfort of your own home. Perfect for those Netflix marathons.   My all-time favorites:  Vegetable spring rolls: free with a $30+ order; excellent Jatujak pad Thai: always a winner Red curry: excellent balance of flavors and spices Green curry with beef: the more spicier of the curries Masaman curry: my pick of the three curries due to the peanut sauce Mango salad: classic   Awesome Thai iced tea (redeemable for free by checking in!)"}
{"text":"Fresh rolls were amazing. Must haves   Khao soi is arguably better than the places downtown. Nice coconut flavour and a little heat. Ordered with chicken which was very generously portioned.   Pad Kee mao with vegetables was yummy and loaded with veggies and tofu. Quite spicy but enjoyed the heat. Very flavorful. But don't expect any sweetness.   Very reasonably priced with good service. Lots of seating space at this location.  Highly recommend and would definitely come back! Scarborough eats!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the restaurant but I've ordered through uber-eats on several occasions. Such great food, probably one of the best pad thais I've had (it just really hits the spot)."}
{"text":"We moved to the area recently, and I'm happy to have found a good Thai place. I was pleasantly surprised by this place.   Décor: 4/5 We came here on a weekday. So the place was busy, but not crazy. We got seated right away. The place is actually bigger than I expected with the first room, leading to a second bigger room. The restaurant can fit quite a lot of people. The second room has better lighting than the first room. I liked the way place is decorated with the cool mural on the wall and the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The room had a modern feel to it with the high ceiling and concrete walls.  Service: 3/5 Overall the service is a bit slow, but the food is good.  Food: 4/5 We ordered the satay beef for an appetizer, which was nice and soft and had a nice flavour to it. While it was good, it wasn't my favourite dish of the night.  For mains we also ordered the Jatujak pad thai with shrimp, which I really enjoyed. The sauce had a nice balance to it, and I'm glad that it didn't have a ketchup taste to it that some pad thai's can have. The shrimps were nicely sized and they give you quite a few. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The portion sizes are pretty big and if you ordered this for one person you would be very satisfied.   The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. For dessert we got the mango stick rick, which was delicious. Presentation for this was cute laid out is a heart. The colourful rice was nice, warm, and well cooked. The sauce that comes with it is pretty sweet, but balances well with the sour tang of the mango. It's very filling and I would recommend sharing it between two or even three people, especially if you carb loaded on your main meal.   I'd definitely come back the next time I'm craving Thai food."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying this small restaurant and it was absolutely amazing. The place has super pretty wallpaper and the waiters made great recommendations.   For appetizer, we ordered the shrimp roll. The peanut sauce is so good but there are just simply too much veggie in the roll, too much to keep a foodie happy.   For entree, we ordered the red curry, green curry, pad Thai and egg plant stir fry. Honestly it is the best Thai food I have eaten in canada, all of them taste amazing, I would recommend red curry, it is so tasty u will want to lick the plate.  For dessert, we got mango sticky rice. I travelled to Thailand before and i could eat like 4 of those every day there. It didn't disappoint me at jatujak, it is so delicious and the flavors are so well-balanced which made everyone so happy.   Overall, I will definitely go back. 10/10 recommended."}
{"text":"Feel like I must write a more in-depth review to this place. Have never been to Thailand before but assume this place is pretty authentic for Thai street food. I tend to usually go here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and the space has a great vibe to it. I continue to love their seats and decorative drawings of the food on chalkboards. The best part is the service is fast for the food and they have cheap lunch specials for under $8. Portion sizes are great even for their lunch size options. My favourite dishes there are the Pad kee mao and chicken green curry if you can handle the spice level. The good thing is if you want dishes more mild, they can accommodate it for you. As mentioned, I have tried their freshly brewed Iced Thai tea and though it is refreshing and different, I wouldn't get it again simply since I find the price a bit steep (3.95) for a glass of iced tea. The friends I were with also said they would be back again."}
{"text":"My go to Thai restaurant for delivery. Min of $30 for delivery but very fast deliver - under 20 mins. I've tried several items on the menu and have not been dissatisfied. Fav dish: pad Thai! Large portion - can easily be split between 2."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. They deliver AND you can order online, so many pluses for me :)"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in this place. I ordered the Pad Ka Pao with chicken, and it was basically just stir fried bell peppers and and chicken. The sauce was indeed quite spicy as described, but the dish still fell flat. The peppers were undercooked and the chicken didn't taste as though it was pre-marinated at all. It basically just taste like someone at home cut up a few veggies and chicken breast and threw it in a pan for a few minutes and added a grocery store marinade.   At least I had a taste of some of my friend's dishes which were quite a bit better and brings up this review a bit. From my experience: stick with the noodles and curries."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I'm definitely going to try again. We had:  - Green Curry Beef - Panang Chicken - Holy Basil with Egg (Chicken) - Pla rad prik - Pad Thai - Thai Ice Tea  They were all well above average quality, good portion sizes, reasonable prices. In particular, I think the Green Curry and the Panang were favoured by the most people. We'll come back again and try some more things."}
{"text":"Best thai iced tea ever!! A must order if you come here.  Loved the ambiance too (looks so much nicer inside than the other shops in the plaza).  Good service, prompt and courteous.  We ordered the pad thai with beef which was very flavourful and good and also the chicken curry which was fresh. I preferred the pad thai - a must eat dish whenever I go for thai food!  Definitely looking forward to going back... I am still craving and thinking about their thai iced tea... Delicious!"}
{"text":"Popped in today for lunch.   Had the khao soi.   It was quite tasty and the prices are pretty reasonable.  The broth had a great aroma and there was lots of flavour.   Portion of chicken is quite generous and the ingredients work very well together.   Atmosphere was very nice, simple decor.  Staff was friendly and had recommendations which was nice.  Good to get a reservation during peak time as it does sometimes get busy at lunch.  Wouls definitely go again."}
{"text":"I went there for a Friday girl's night. I made a reservation one day ahead through Yelp and get the response very quickly.   The food there is great, as what it says street food. Pad kee mao is my favourite. The strong spiciness and fresh lime sourness combine perfectly. But the vegetables are very raw which are not my type, just my personal preference. This is my first time to have Tom Kha soup. I like this creamy coconut flavour with a variety of Asian herbs I'm not able to name. Tom yum soup is also recommended. I prefer this one to PAI. Right, for the appetizer I ordered a shrimp chips to share with my friends. The sauce coming with the shrimp chips tastes awesome! Talking about the dessert, Tapioca coconut pudding is way beyond my sweetness extream....  Overall, it is a good place to hang out with friends if you are around Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Finally ordered some food from this restaurant as I was dying to try it. Quite disappointed with what I got.   I ordered the cold shrimp rolls as appetizer which looks like a 3 years old made it. The rolls were falling apart and not tight rolled. It was so big that you can't even bite into it.   I also ordered two main. One was their Jatujak Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. The Pad Thai was ok but seriously just one shrimp!! The other main was their Jatujak Fried Rice. The rice was over cooked and mushy. Not impressed at all!  I've had better Thai food and was hoping this place was could be one of them. Sorry Jatujak you will not be on my list of favourites."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Tried the coconut soup. Amazing flavour. The chicken wings were also delicious. The pad Thai and pineapple rice were delicious as well. The Thai iced tea was phenomenal. Halal is on the door. Place is pretty small and you may have to wait for a table for a while like we did. Great service."}
{"text":"Great food  must try the Tom kha soup and the Thai iced tea. The location is large lots of seating. Delicious thai food in Scarborough"}
{"text":"A very nice place, just as my girlfriend says it's a place where you can taste authentic Thai food while enjoying the cozy furnishings. I will definitely recommend this place to people who addict to Southeast Asian Food."}
{"text":"We revisited here again.  This time is for our dinner time.   Same things, great food and great decor.  I enjoy the quiet and gentle atmosphere in a restaurant and definitely it wins my heart. We ordered green curry with veg, khao sow with chicken, tom yum soup with shrimps, mango sticky rice and ginger tea and a beer.  Food: Authentic Thai Street Food Price: $$ Reasonable Service: Friendly and Welcoming and Fast Speedy Cooking time (considering there was 3 more tables at the same time)   A surprise to us was that we got a free appetizers , what a lovely owner!! :) Thanks Jatujak @ Victoria Park   Will recommend this place and so missing Thailand and here I can find the taste again!! We are the fan from now"}
{"text":"This is a nice find in a small Scarborough plaza. A Thai restaurant with decent menu selection, it has most popular Thai dishes such as Pad Thai and Khau Soi. I especially like Pad Kee Mao and the mango salad. A decent ambience with the music player playing 90s pop mostly which isn't a bother since you do feel like you are somewhere else once inside the restaurant. Large enough space for visitors with an extension room , it's a nice place to get a tastyThai dish at decent price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I found out about Jatujak online as I was craving for authentic Thai food.  The first time I decided to give this place a try, I looked at their menu online.  I was going to order the Tom Yum Soup, Coconut Rice, and Larb Kai Salad - spicy minced pork salad. I called to place my order and they said that I wasn't able to get delivery because they weren't delivering at that time.  I tried calling again to ask for pick up and a gentleman answered the phone, put me on hold without notifying me, and I was waiting on the phone for a good 2-3 minutes until another lady answered the phone and did the same thing.  So I finally hung up the phone and I tried calling again to place my order for pick up and he told me that some of the items on their online menu aren't in their system so I wasn't able to order the dish because he could not punch in the order for me?  (Did not make any sense to me - was I able to order the dish or was I not??).  I got my colleague to call to place the order and she was telling me the difficulty in placing the order with them as well.  The lady on the phone was saying how they didn't have that specific item on the menu and that the prices have changed, etc.  We were not concerned about the pricing, we were trying to figure out if they could make it or not!  Anyways, when all was said and done, we went to go pick up our order from the restaurant and with orders over $35, you receive 3 complimentary vegetable spring rolls.  When we got there, we told them we had an order for pick up and the gentleman gave us our order and we had to ask for our drink because he forgot we ordered it.. He then proceeds to leave the drink on the counter instead of handing it to us directly.  At this point, I was already disappointed with the lack of customer service we received.  We picked up the order  and went back to the office, only to find out that they did not include the spring rolls.  Both of us were so disappointed, we called them back to ask about the spring rolls and they said they'd make it for us but we'd have to go back and pick it up.  All in all, food was very tasty and the portion size was fair for the price we paid.  However, the customer service sucked!!  I figured I'd give them another chance and I ordered the same thing I had last time (without the Tom Yum Soup) and this time, taking my order was easy-breezy!  He got my order in one shot so I was impressed.  I also ended up receiving free vegetable spring rolls with my order because we ordered more than $35.  (Brownie Points!!)  The food was good this time as well but the portions were SUFFICIENTLY less and full of vegetables than the previous time I had ordered.  Overall, I'd say the food was delicious, and I may or may not revisit again.  I'm a little disappointed because BlogTO stated they were well known for their food but the past experiences I've had with them makes me really reconsider.  If anything, I'm sure there's other authentic Thai restaurants that are better.."}
{"text":"Great Thai place for when you can't make it downtown :) It is not an OMG so good it'll blow your socks off but good enough that I'll return again when I'm hungry uptown (thus the 4 stars not 5)   1. The place is small so make a reservation or come early  2. The Thai ice tea is great, don't get the green one, tastes very water down and not as flavourful.  3. The red curry was SO good. I went with mild and it was the perfect touch of zing! I usually get green curry but after reading the other reviews I went with red and am glad I did.  4. My bf got the Khao soi, not as good as Khao San Road's. He got it in medium, since the noodle was soaked in the sauce it was a little too spicy to handle. 5. Another friend got the Holy basil beef in medium and loved it. The medium spice was more of a chili oil taste that fizzled out after 6 . Sticky rice dessert was awesome, the mango was nice and sweet. I'm surprised they had good mango since it's winter!   All in all, staff were very attentive, cute LITTLE spot, food was good (better than thai express :P)   Wish they had offer free Thai ice tea on yelp like they do at the other location when you check in. Also for a party of 5, we did not get anything free as one of the highlights suggested."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I've had in a long time.   The flavours were authentic and the pad thai was made with proper sauce.  We also had the green curry chicken lunch special, which was spicy and delicious.  You could taste the herbs that the chicken was cooked with, another authentic touch."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for Thai food in Scarborough.   The beef khao soi was flavourful and had just the right amount of heat/spice!!  I don't know if I like the khao soi more, or the chicken green curry. Both so good, yet so different....I think it's a tie! (That's why I always order both).  Comparable to Khao Soi Road and Pai downtown, but Jatujak is so much closer to home.  My favourite Thai joint in Scarborough!!"}
{"text":"As far as I can tell, they've modified their menu and did as I asked.  The menu now really does reflect more authentic Thai.  If you're a fan of Sukho downtown or Pai, this is a great alternative out in the burbs.  I'm not even sure there's a reasonable alternative within a reasonable drive in the area.  Anyways, I'm super happy to have this place in the back yard."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  You feel like you are in downtown Toronto when you get inside.  The food was amazing and all the dishes that we ordered came out piping hot.  I enjoyed the spicy beef salad but the beef was a little on the chewy side, nonetheless, the salad itself and dressing was so flavourful.  The pineapple fried rice was good and had generous amounts of pineapples.  The pad kee mao (spicy stir fried rice noodles with egg in a basil sauce) was my absolute favourite because I love spicy and the noodles were al dente, my favourite way.  The spicy crispy chicken was mediocre because the outer breaded layer was quite soggy which personal preference would have enjoyed a crispier texture.  Also, tried the esaan chicken sausage and it was exploding in juices, beware as it was piping HOT.  My husband had their Thai iced tea but was not a fan as he mentioned it tasted watered down, overly sweet and lacked tea flavour.  Overall, looking forward for a future visit again as it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Came to the Victoria Park location for late lunch on Saturday. The place was cozy and nicely arranged. Ordered mango salad, tom kha, curry puff, basil chicken and thai ice tea. Overall, good food and warm service."}
{"text":"Have to agree on the reviews for Jatujak! It's really one of the best Thai restaurants in toronto area.   The ambiance of this place is clean, modern and more than a gem for its location.  Air Ventilation is great! I love when restaurants proves a cozy and trendy and hip atmosphere....  Service and speedy and pleasant.   I had the fish curry, which is super yummy and great flavour!   My hubby had the green curry chicken...it's living up the expectations.   *only bad*  The rice served need some improvement. It's too dry.... Maybe a diff type of rice brand or a rice cooker???"}
{"text":"This place has got to be my favorite Thai spot as of yet.  We called when we were 20 mins away and they took our reservation sweetly. When we got there we were seated right away, and the place was pretty busy. We ordered two soups, one of the coconut and one of the tomato ones, they were SO SO delicious! We ordered curry puffs and they were made to perfection, we also ordered the springs rolls- they were pretty good but not the best I've had. The peanut sauce wasn't phenomenal but it's all good because the overall experience was fantastic. The service was wonderful and we really enjoyed ourselves. I will certainly be returning for more."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with all the authentic Thai food and drinks. Would love to go for another visit."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Thai! The best part is that they are also on ubereats (for the Scarborough region anyway). Over the last few years they have expanded the restaurant so it's much easier to get a table.  My personal favourites are the green curry, and the holy basil with egg. Both dishes are super flavourful and spicy."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend and my first impression wasn't great considering the location. Really? Lawrence/Vic park?! But it was actually really nice inside, and very busy. The parking is a little tight, but once you get inside, the décor is Thai inspired and modern; think Khao San Road, but toned down a little. It's clean and bright.   We got seated quickly, and had time to peruse the menu. The servers were really busy, so the service was tad on the slower side, but they were very attentive. We ordered the shrimp chips and spring rolls to share. Haven't had shrimp chips in ages! So it was nice to see it on the menu with the peanut sauce. My friend got the pad thai and I tried the Pad Kee Mao. The portions were really big, and if you order an appetizer, you probably won't be able to finish. Which is totally fine, I ate mine for lunch the next day - still good!  I asked for my pad thai to be spicy, and it was okay... not enough to set your mouth on fire... just enough for a nice kick. The thai iced-tea is a great if you want something to cool down with.  Next time I want to try the khao soi."}
{"text":"Yum!  We were invited here by someone who lives in the area and were really impressed. The place was had cute, minimalist, casual decor. It was smallish but not too small. The staff was extremely friendly. And, most importantly, the food was truly delicious. I had the green curry with tofu. The veggie spring rolls were super, too. We returned here a few weeks later.   A small note: I think the curry was a bit spicier than I'm used to in other Thai places in Toronto, i.e., when I tell them I want it mild, it's usually more mild than it was here. The second time I came I forgot about that and asked for \"medium\" spice. I found it extremely spicy. So, my advice is to \"order down\" in terms of spice level. Next time I'll ask for \"very mild\":) This of course is entirely related to my own spice tolerance and has nothing to do with the quality of the place.   I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"I am very displease with this location if you compare it to the North York location. I decided to try it out at this location because I wanted to propose to my bridesmaid here. I was very disappointed. The location was small and stuffy. Men's washroom was not working. The quality and presentation of the food was close to being bad in comparison to the North York location. The curry was watery, pineapple fried rice lacked curry, I was extremely disappointed. We could see this restaurant and it didn't feel like a nice place to dine. More like a fast food, while in the walks type atmosphere. They were very busy with take out orders but because of that their food lacked quality. The only reason they got two star was of their good customer service. I would not come back nor dine here again. If you're looking to dine, I highly recommend the north York location. It's three time bigger, cleaner, working washrooms and an actually a nice environment to dine in."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check out this Thai restaurant It's a 8-10 tables restaurant, very small. If you are in one of the middle tables, you won't have enough space for the food. Not too comfortable in terms of seatings.   We ordered the Lemon grass chicken, the sauce is a wet sauce and a very generous amount of lemon grass. I find the meat itself lacks flavours.  Moving on to the Khao Sao with beef, the presentation was beautifully done. The egg noodle was angled in the bowl, you will have to dip it into the yellow curry before you start eating. I find the yellow curry way to sweet to my liking and the beef lacks flavour.  And last but not least, the Shrimp in the Pad Kee Mao was a good size and the flavour of the noodle was good. Overall a 3.5 stars for this restaurant."}
{"text":"This little chic restaurant definitely took the cake for best Thai food in my recent memory. I've put off writing this review because I wanted a couple of visits before I could deem it such. Thai food is one of those cuisines that everyone is vaguely familiar with and yet not many restaurants can do it right. Easily dismissible because of its association its distant cousin that is Thai Express and other brandable fast food, it tends to be overlooked.  Jatujak should not be so easily dismissed. Tucked away in the vast crevices of Scarborough, both branches sport similar look and feel (we frequented the Victoria branch, mainly for the convenience of parking). Beautifully and cleanly decorated with murals and hand drawn food pictorials, the restaurant is a great place for couples' night, dining with friends, or even a lovely family meal. They label themselves as street food but sport many typical Thai dishes but with a twist of personality and quality. The price is a little steeper than what is expected but the quality and quantity makes justify the means.   During our first visit, my BF ordered the veggie Pad Kee Mao and I ordered the Khoi Sao out of habit. It should be noted that I don't like Khao Soi (solely preference based). I will say, this was by far the best Khao soi I've had. The portion was impressive and many component worked well, and there were some not so much. The curry broth was glorious, lovely flavoured and perfect consistency. They added some sweet and sour pickled veggies that did wonders to cut the creaminess and added contrast (flavour and texture wise). What did not work was the chicken, it was lacking its own flavour and had a strange freezer-burnt taste, was not too fond. I would've preferred the egg noodles a bit more al-dente but it was tolerable.  The Pad Kee Mao was the star of the night. The rice noodle and veggie was cooked to perfect consistency; the flavour was on point with every note. This dish did not miss a beat.   On the second visit, we tried the veggie pad thai, the chicken sausage special and a veggie green curry. Once again, their noodle dish was on target. Perfection on a plate; each component compliment and added to the dish. The wow factor was a unique smokey carmelly flavour sauce sported, the flavour was addicting and just brought the whole dish to another level. The sausage was the low-key of the meal, the texture of the sausage was grainy and lean, it lacked flavour itself and all the flavour profile came from the dipping sauce. Next was the green curry, nothing too mind-blowing. Everything was good, high quality of ingredient, well cooked veggies and the broth had depth.   Overall, the experience was undoubtedly enjoyable. We will definitely come back for more. Lovely dining experience with great food, and friendly staff. They do their noodle dishes exceptionally well, their skills and quality are praiseworthy. Give it a try if you are in the area or looking for a great Thai place."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4 Service-3 Food-5 Strikeouts-0/3  Came here on 3 multiple occasions, and I enjoyed it every time. The food was top quality for the cuisine art. The service is a bit slow since there's only 2 people as wait staff, but the place seems relatively clean for the shady area that's surrounding it.   This is definitely the best Thai place uptown Toronto. They have the traditional Khao Soi, Pad Thai, and a variety of curry. They not only have these items, but they do it all well! Even the lemongrass chicken wings were good. I'd have to suggest both soups, the Tom yum and Tom Kha, depending if you like spiciness or not is the one you'll choose. Drink wise, the Thai Iced tea here is done best at this location even compared with the ones downtown. Not lacking in sweetness or not overpowering either. The last recommendation would be the Mange Sticky Rice. I can say it taste amazing, but you can look at the pictures themselves and you'll know it looks amazing too!"}
{"text":"Our go to Thai place! Some of the best Thai food I have ever had, and the mango sticky rice dessert is to die for. Have been here 5 times now and have yet to have a meal that is anything short of stellar. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service at this small mom and pop joint. Comforting, affordable and just enough variety to keep you interested past the usual Thai suspects.  Highly recommend any of their fried rices, their Khoa San tofu and shrimp, and their pad Thai. I really enjoyed their larger than life salad rolls and very packed and excessively large spring rolls.   I can't say much else other than they take some Canadian thai staples and make them REALLLYYYY well!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Thai restaurant in Scarborough for a long time. This is a little out of the way (Victoria Park) but if you drive it's in a very easily accessible location. One time I showed up 10 minutes before closing (which I know is a sin) but they were still so welcoming and made sure to get me a table to wait at even though I was getting takeout."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after looking at a condo nearby. You can tell it's authentic from the moment you walk in. We both ordered the chicken khao soi. It was very good, although not as good as Khao San Road's downtown. We noticed the dishes other tables were ordering and they looked amazing so we'd definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Unexpected for the kind of sketchy neighbourhood. My son and I stopped in for a pad Thai and mango salad with some green tea. Services was blazing fast and friendly. Food was very fresh. I've been looking for a good Thai place in the east end, and this is it.  Highly recommend.  Only issue is the tables are too small for the large plates and sharing that goes well with this type of Thai food. Keep up the great work. You've got a nice little business here."}
{"text":"Was seated right before a big group and the lunch rush came in. The service seemed a bit overwhelmed from the rush.  I got the pad thai lunch special with salad and spring roll with the upgraded drink to thai iced tea. The apps were ok, salad with iceberg lettuce and mango with a fish sauce dressing were fine, nothing crazy. The spring roll was better I thought with the dipping sauce, good ratio to stuffing and wonton wrap.  The pad thai was pretty good! Overall in the GTA, it goes in the upper tier I might have to say. Just the right amount of sauce and noodles and a fair sized portion that wasn't overkill.   The thai ice tea was GREAT. A little too sweet but very close to what you get in actual Thailand. All for about $13. The service is friendly, a little slow in getting to us in the far corner. The interior is nice and clean.   I would for sure come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Some of the most tasty Thai food I have ever had in the city. That includes some of the super expensive chic places in Toronto. The curries are very flavourful and complex. The portions are more than fair. Two meals at least from any take out. Cold rolls: Excellent. In a word: Excellent, and really nice people as well. We found this place because of Yelp, and we felt it only fair to put our two cents in."}
{"text":"There are few Thai food restaurants I always enjoy tasting their food specialties, but Jatujak is one that made my day. Authentic Thai food as it is, I enjoyed the Pad Thai, Eggplant Stir Fry and Pineapple fried rice. I am coming back here for sure to taste other food you have."}
{"text":"Jatujak service and consistency has gone way down we actually stopped ordering from this place about a year ago when we noticed that staff and food not on point like it used to be, especially on days when the manager isn't around. One time we ordered they mixed up the herbs (like basil in a dish that does not usually have basil), another time the pad thai was burned, and the massaman chicken was missing the garnish (they usually include crispy onions and shredded cabage on the side). As for staff, there is one lady in particular that should not be taking phone orders. Sometimes the phone even seems like it's off the hook! I get they have busy periods, but when you can't get through before dinner time, there is something else going on. Sorry Jatujak, you had a good thing going but you are just like all the others now, nothing special."}
{"text":"We checked in. And a party of 5. The decorations at the place is nice looks like a nice family restaurant. Comfortable and cozy. It is however not recommended for large parties as their are not a lot of larger tables. Now onto the food. The the pad thai chicken was good. It had a different flavour then most thai restaurant. But it worked.   The curry was solid. Exactly what you expect. It may not wow you completely. However it will provide what you expect to find in an average to slightly above average thai restaurant. Given ive been to thailand to try authentic dishes and i think was not bad.  Now the lemongrass chicken wings the flavour was good. However the chicken were very overcooked and very dry inside. Also the crispy mango chicken had the same problem. The chicken was overcooked and dry on the inside. So meat was rough.         About the food overall i find it was a decent restaurant that provided thai food as a decent level.             Service wise however, Two problems i had was the way they charged. On the final bill without heads up they would charge +1 or +2 dollars for whatever meat was with pad thai or curry separate. I find that dissengenious as by doing that they tried to make their menu seem cheaper then it is. And also they mandatory charged 15% tips on a party of 5. Which is not typical for any restaurant. Its not about percentage but moreso on how they approached it. Overall i find they need to be more upfront and clear about their charging policies to customers in order to not leave a bad taste of them adding a lot of extra cost without informing them. And also they need to work on their other appetizer dish as well and mango chicken. I would go back under certain circumstances."}
{"text":"I was quite excited to see that a Thai restaurant had recently opened near my old neighbourhood. Technically it's in North York since Victoria Park Ave is the dividing line between North York and Scarborough but nonetheless a good Thai restaurant is hard to find in this part of the city. I read that the original Kingston Rd location had garnered good reviews and I was curious if the second location would be just as good.  My friend and I dropped by around 8:30 - 9 pm during a weekday for a late night dinner and the place was completely empty. We were quickly greeted and seated. We decided on the Gaeng Kiew Whan ($9.95 plus $2.00 for shrimp before tax) and the Jatujak Pad Thai ($9.95 plus $1.00 for beef before tax) and two green Nom Yen drinks ($3.50 each before tax). Both dishes came out in less than 5 minutes and this is not a good sign unless you're at McDonald's regardless if the place was empty or not.  Gaeng Kiew Whan ($9.95 plus $2.00 for shrimp): This is essentially a green curry dish which was served with shrimp, you had the option of choosing chicken, beef or shrimp and a bowl of white jasmine rice. The dish was very mediocre, it was overly spicy and the broth was very watery and lacked the proper amount of coconut milk.  Jatujak Pad Thai ($9.95 plus $1.00 for beef): This dish which should be probably their signature dish on the menu was really bad. Very saucy and lacked the spiciness that comes from crushed chili peppers. If you have ever been to Sukothai or Pai and tried their Pad Thai, the difference in quality, taste and authenticity is worlds apart.  Nom Yen Green ($3.50 before tax): The drink which was essentially a green milk tea was fantastic, refreshing and sweet but not two sweet.  Service/Decor: The service was good and the waiter was patient in explaining things and wasn't overbearing. The decor was nice, a lot of dark colours and a very relaxed atmosphere.  Overall, it's difficult for me to give a new small business two stars but the food is really not that good and it's not authentic Thai food. As I mentioned before, if you have been to Pai or Sukothai you will be able to tell a big difference and I have Thai friends and have had the chance to enjoy home cooked Thai food. The food is reasonably priced but they definitely have to improve the quality of the food. I really hope this was a one off experience and a bad night for them."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped here on Sunday at 5pm for take out after a day at the beach. It wasn't busy when we arrived but was starting to get busy when we left. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Chicken Khao Soi. It took about 10mins to prepare our order but it just sat there for another 5mins because no one told us our order was ready...  I tried the pad thai and it was really good, the seasoning was just right (some places add too much salt or too much tamarind) and there were a good amount of chicken.  The khao soi was okay, I feel like we didn't construct it properly so we didn't taste it as how it was originally intended so I would like to try it again but next time in the restaurant.  This place is a little bit out of the way for me so I'll come back but only if I'm in the area and craving Thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Scarborough area! It is worth the 30 minute drive there and back for me, every single time!   I will say that their Khao Soi is very good and comparable to Khao San Road's... I order this whenever I am too lazy to trek downtown and crave the creamy crunchy noodle combination.   Their pad Thai is really good also... They have two types but I always go with their traditional one.   Portions are big for take out (I have never dined in) and really worth the price :)"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem. I would recommend the pad kee mau (must try for spice lovers) gaeng masamang with chicken and the mango salad. I've also tried the Pad Thai which I thought was decent but a bit too sweet and the Khao soi (beef) which I felt was a bit dry. For dessert we had the mango sticky rice -  can never go wrong !"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Pad Kee Mao and fish Gaeng Kiew Whan. Both amazing.  Delivery a bit rough.  Would eat again."}
{"text":"Pretty good thai food in the scarborough area. Definitely not a place for big parties, so stick with smaller groups when coming here. Pad thai, chicken wings were both delicious."}
{"text":"Flavour is great, price is decent, but sometimes hard to find a seat since it's not a big place. We always see lots of people ordering takeout.  This place can definitely be in the same league as khao san and sabai sabai."}
{"text":"The dishes here are great for sharing, meaning their portions are quite sizeable. The green curry can definitely be split between two people if you order another bowl of rice.   Amongst a party of two, we had the curry puffs, the vegetable green curry, the beef khao soi and the mango sticky rice, which was plenty of food to fill us up. The curry puffs were amazing! They were so fresh and piping hot with crispy exteriors and fluffy interiors. Would definitely recommend the curry puffs as an appetizer. The green curry was just alright. I wish it had more of a lemon grass taste that traditional green curries have. It's also important to note that the green curry here is NOT made vegan. Instead of just coconut milk as their base, they add cow's milk as well. This kind of turned me off a bit because traditionally green curry doesn't have cow's milk, but I just asked the server to make it without the titty juice and they were very accommodating. The star of the night however was definitely the mango sticky rice. It was so beautifully plated and tasted heavenly. There were three mounts of rice, each dyed a bright colour, surrounded by mangoes in the shape of a heart with coconut milk on the side- DELICIOUS is all I can say. The rice was slightly salty which complimented the sweet, sweet mangoes. I would go back just for this!   The ambience of the restaurant is nice too. It's nice and quiet and not too uncomfortably small like some of the Thai spots downtown. Everything is tinted a golden, yellow colour, giving the place a warm vibe.   If you're looking for a Thai place in Scarborough, I'd recommend Jatujak. Its obviously not going to be on par with some of the spots downtown like Khao San Road and Pai, but it'll definitely satisfy your Thai cravings. Go get the mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"The stir fry was amazing.  The portions are great and the price is right. This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We came for lunch after church one Sunday, and I was quite surprised that we did not have to wait for a table. I've been meaning to come for quite some time, but had neglected to do so.   I had their pad kee mao lunch special, which was $7.99. It comes with chicken. I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size. It was enough for my lunch and I did bring the leftovers home. There was enough left for a breakfast or a snack. The pad kee mao was served piping hot, and it really does make a difference. The chicken was tender, and there was a decent amount of it. It actually tasted like chicken! The veggies were crisp and fresh. I was very pleased with my lunch choice.  My brother had their khao soi with beef $12 + 2 for beef? Something like that. It was presented beautifully. Loads of crispies on top. Definitely instagram worthy. The coconut curry broth was delightufl. The beef brisket was surprisingly tender. There were some raw onions and a bit of coleslaw to cut through some of the richness of the curry. It was a nice touch. The crispies definitely added some crunch to the dish. Also very tasty.   I'd order both of these dishes again in a heartbeat. I'd also definitely come again. Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"This most recent visit to Jatujak was our second time in over a year and we all left the restaurant very full and satiated. Since my first visit, they seem to have opened additional dining space which is attractively decorated, spacious, and great for larger groups.   We ordered mango salad, which was served in an interesting fried crispy cracker like shell. The mango salad was fresh, savoury, and refreshing. We also ordered Thai iced teas, chicken penang curry, beef massuman curry, mango crispy chicken, and pad thai. All of the dishes we ordered were flavourful and generously portioned. The curries and crispy chicken were served with small bowls of rice. In my opinion, the pad thai at Jatujak is better than the pad thai at sister restaurant Kub Khao as Kub Khao's version is too sweet for my taste. Not to mention that the shrimp pad thai came with very large, nicely cooked pieces of shrimp.   This latest visit was better than our first experience at Jatujak the year they first opened as they did not have air conditioning on that hot summer day and the chicken in our curry had an off-putting taste, as though it was not fresh. Thankfully all of our dishes tasted great this time around. We probably over-ordered for the 5 of us in our party but at least hubby and I had enough leftovers for another meal or two! Sadly we were too stuffed to order dessert but I hear they have a colourful and delicious mango sticky rice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered pad Thai and love the taste . Much better than other places I have tried . =)"}
{"text":"Every now and then we had cravings for Thai. But there aren't many good Thai restaurants around. So I checked out the Yelp and found this place. There are many choices, so we ordered some classics: lemon grass chicken wings, Thai ice tea, beef pad Thai, and chicken green curry. Chicken wing is the best! Pad Thai is slightly too sweet, and green curry isn't creamy enough, a bit more coconut milk and less bell peppers would be better. If this small diner were in Singapore I would give a 3-star, but here in Toronto, it definitely worth a 4-star. Oh, the waitress was nice and polite. I'll try green ice tea next time."}
{"text":"I had chicken satay, tom yum soup, drunken noodles and chicken basil stir fry. Till this day I'm still thinking about their drunken noodles and would drive 45 mins each way to get them. Their mild is not spicy at all so medium would be the way to go. Can't wait to go back to try their holy basil with egg on rice."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I've had in the city...  better than anything else I've had.  We had delivery and it arrived on time, tasted amazing and was a lot of food.  Will definitely eat this food again... would recommend it to everybody who loves Thai Food.  Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Usually I'm not a big fan of thai food.. but I realized it's because I've been having unauthentic thai food (referring to thai express) lol... this place definitely changed my view on thai food. It's not just pad Thai (which I don't like)  Restaurant was really cute and looks smaller on the outside. There's a cute room inthe back with more tables and the walls were covered in artwork.   #1 Lemongrass Chicken Wings were bomb as fck(excuse my language) but they were so tasty. Spicy, crispy and sweet.   #2 Thai iced tea was the best one I've ever had. Served in a cute mason jar. Perfect amount of sweetness and tea.   #3 Hot and Sour Soup with Chicken was made exactly what I expect. Sweet and spicy with lots of flavor, wish they had more toppings inside (like mushroom, tomatoes).   #3 Pineapple fried rice with shrimp was also tasty and had a hint of curry powder. Dish was moist but I was hoping for it to be in a pineapple shell.   Would definitely recommend. I hope they open more restaurants closer though."}
{"text":"My new go-to spot- I love this restaurant! It's located in a very sketchy plaza so it maybe hard to find in the evening but it's worth the hassle.  I love every dish from this restaurant and you have to try The Thai ice tea.  I had curry. Chicken pad Thai, tofu fried rice. Price is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from here. Used to eat here once a week. Now i am scared to eat take out anywhere. :("}
{"text":"Extremely overrated. Came here for authentic thai and rave reviews big dissapointment. dishes are ridiculously small and very stingy with meat even though you pay extra for it! Curries were alright everything else including the tea way too sweet. Pics of the place are misleading as well as the place is a dump(lack of pride or maintenance) and to top it off stomach did not sit well after our meal.. Never again."}
{"text":"After having a pleasant experience at Kub Khao and finding out that Jatujak is their parent restaurant, I just had to come here. The good news is that it is virtually the same experience which is a great thing for both places. We had a quiet and simple affair, despite it being Saturday evening.   Upon a quick glance, the menu and prices are almost identical to Kub khao's which makes the sense. I ordered the Holy basil with beef (pad gra prao) which was alright. It was fragrant but I was somewhat disappointed with the dish as a whole. It was simply too salty for my liking  and that kind of just overpowered my tastebuds. I found the one I had at Khao san road much, much better. It lacked the bit of sweetness which I love. I also had my favourite khao soi, which was excellent all around.   Like kub khao, the restaurant was clean and simple and the service was adequate. All in all, had a pleasant experience here but I will be sticking to Kub khao as my go-to as it is closer to where I live."}
{"text":"This is me, full carb and carb and carb! This would've been even better if the service was a bit more prompt :) absolutely no complaint about their holy mother of all pad Thai!"}
{"text":"I really like Thai food and in Scarborough it is never easy to find a good place with an authentic taste. So when I found this place it really made my day.   I did not eat in the restaurant as I got take out but man was it good! It was my first time here so I got pad Thai, green curry, peanut chicken, and beef basil Thai. All the selections were very good! The food was already made when I arrived so it was a quick pick up. I added some desserts when I arrived and they were made super fast, the young girl at the front even gave me some hot tea while I waited. I thought it was a very sweet gesture.   I will definitely be coming back for another binge day, as the food is fresh and all the legumes make it healthy. Plus you cannot beat the service."}
{"text":"Thai people doing Thai cooking. They've got it down with authentic flavors and ingredients, and very nice portion sizes. Some of the ingredient proportions are a bit off, but at least I got enough rice unlike some Thai places I've visited. There aren't a lot of drink options either - they have Thai iced tea which is like bubble tea (sweet and likely artificial in many ways), or water, or basic sodas. I asked for the most authentic desserts (of the 4) and they steered me to #1, which was icy on the bottom with sweetened coconut milk, red beans, and some other ingredients on top. I should have trusted my gut and gone with a #2 or #3. I can't say \"next time\" because it is extremely unlikely I'll find myself in this part of this city for a meal again, but I would certainly come back if I happened to live near here."}
{"text":"Small restaurant. But good food. Will be going again. Had the chicken pad Thai and salad drink combo . Salad and egg roll were delicious.  I can't wait to go back. Downside is restaurant offers no washroom. I always like to wash up. Should give out wet naps instead of dry towels.  *correction* washroom is in restaurant. Not visible; however it is there behind the curtains. Fantastic ."}
{"text":"Shrimp veggie rolls: amazing dips and sauces, the ingredients were very fresh, however there was maybe half a slice of shrimp in every roll, not worth it in my opinion.  Mango salad: awesome flavors and very refreshing! Would recommend Veggie pad Thai: a bit overly sweet and tasted very saucy, delicious tho!   Overall okay meal, I love Thai food, but everything felt either a bit too sweet, or too sour"}
{"text":"Jatujak street thai food  isn't bad, its on par with other thai restaurant I have been to.  My go to dish is the pad thai it tasted great I like that they place the peanuts and bean sprouts on the side, I had the chicken and it was tender and portions are good. The pad woon sen was also good with beef both non spicy. I don't take a lot of spice and the green curry chicken was not bad either.  I would recommend this place for good tasty thai food.  The service on the other hand correlates with the 'street' style service."}
{"text":"A really good option for Thai food in Scarborough.   I got the vegetarian khoi soi (?) which is a classic northern Thai noodle soup. The rice noodles are soaked in a yellow curry soup base and it's delicious. This dish is hard to come by in a lot of Thai restaurants, so finding it on their menu was a nice surprise.   The dish was delicious. My favourite part was the mix of wet noddles in the soup and deep fried noodles on top. The tofu was semi firm and deep Fried as well, cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed my meal and will be back -especially on a colder day.   Their mango rice was also well done and a nice way to end the meal. A+ for fast Thai food."}
{"text":"I had Khao San Road for the first time a few weeks back - and I must say, I like Jatujak more. Now before people start to disagree, it could've been because I was at KSR's sister restaurant, Nanas because it was a Tuesday and they were renovating. I had the same thing at both restaurants, the signature Pad Thai with Shrimp.  I'm sure you can request the level of heat for your dishes, however I wanted to see what their default was. It was not spicy at all, but it was freaking delicious! For $12.95, you really can't go wrong. The portions are big, and the food quality is definitely there. I would recommend for anyone who doesn't want to spend too much on a pad thai downtown as the quality is better IMO.  My friend ordered the mango chicken which was really delicious (mango was nice and ripe) and thai iced tea. I'm not a fan of sugary drinks and asked if they could adjust the sugar level, but as expected they too use a pre-mixed thai tea. I had a sip and it was still good though :)"}
{"text":"The food was alright. The portion is kind of small. Ordered green curry and pad Thai. The flavor to be honest is good average at best. Good service tho."}
{"text":"Food is great, place is clean, pretty good for a date i would say. I enjoy it and will be back. Curry is delicious. Good selections on the menu. Wifi password is thailand2559. Will be back for more Thai food. Definitely a gem in that area."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food in Toronto. Best pad Thai. No too sour not too sweet.  We eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"I just moved to the Wexford area and had no idea that these gems exist. I have Pho Metro for viet, Makkal Chon for Korean and now Jatujak for authentic Thai! My first visit consisted of a simple meal, Khao Soi to cure my hangover from the night before. It was delicious! The broth was nice and spicy and there was some pickled cabbage as a garnish to help compliment the richness of the flavourful coconut curry broth. You have to try the Thai iced green tea, it is a natural compliment to any dish.  The ambience is nice, like something you'd see in the city, and the staff is super friendly. Thanks for bringing some good eats to the eclectic wexford food scene. You'll see me on a weekly basis :p"}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant at their Victoria Street location (sketchy area btw) but never been to this one so I decided to check it out while being nearby.   Wow, I didn't realised the place was small with only twenty seats available (two seats being taken by the fan) when I got there compared to their Victoria brand. There are 3 sofas chairs on the side wall for people to wait for their takeout.   There is no AC but that day, since it just rained, it didn't feel hot and stuffy.   Looking at the menu, I don't remember being that small with limited choices. I also didn't noticed they charge now $2 for Chicken or beef and $3 shrimps. I remember it only used to be $1 more for chicken, beef or pork. I guess with inflation, cost is going up.  I decided to get my favourite Pad Kee Mao, try the Street Pad Thai and the monthly special fish curry. I thought I would like the Pad Kee Mao more but it turns out I prefer the Street Pad Thai dish.  I really had wanted to like the Pad kee Mao because I thought they make the dish the same way as Kub Khao ( being they are owned by the same owners) However, the noodles are thinner as they don't use the thicker noodles that I prefer. don't get me wrong, it was still good but I just enjoy the pad Thai more  I couldn't stop devouring the pad Thai.  The fish curry turned out to be smaller since it was a monthly special. I expected it to be pieces of fishes but it was more of a fish curry paste. It was good but didn't expect it to be small. I will stick to the normal curries on their menu in the future.  Service was quick.food comes out super fast.  A lot of tables were ordering spring rolls, which also didn't take long to come out .   This restaurant has been in existence for a while and the owners have decided to open Kub Khao last year, which is great since it is closer to where I am.  Highly recommend to check out either of their locations or Kub Khao on Sheppard."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and the whole restaurant feels comfortable!  I don't need to worries about what I should order, because I simply know that they just make everything good. I especially like their curry dishes.  The whole restaurant is modern and clean. A little dark in the evening because of the lighting."}
{"text":"VERY DECENT thai place!  Atmosphere:  Jatujak's ambiance is a breath of fresh air considering where it's located. There is plenty of space for everybody and I don't think you'd every have to wait to get a seat here.  Food:  While it is not as good as Sukho Thai/Pai/KSR, it's almost there! Factor in the drive to downtown, parking issues, wait lines etc and Jatujak becomes very appealing.  We had Pad Thai and Masamman curry and both of them were very decent. Pad thai was slightly on the sweeter side so make sure to get it highest spice level, Masaman curry was very flavourful but had a little too much onion to my liking.  LemonGrass Wings were very saucy and tasty! I also tried their Mango Sticky rice, presentation was very beautiful and tasted very good as well.  Verdict: I don't think Thai food gets any better than this outside of Downtown TO. If you don't feel like going to downtown, go to this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg so good. Beef salad, red curry, chicken skewers so delicious! The pad thai was good, but could've been less sweet, but you can kinda balance it with some chili hot sauce. Adding to one of my fave restos!"}
{"text":"So glad they deliver AND there's no extra delivery charge (minimum order of $25). Instead they reward you with free Spring rolls for orders over $35 and free pad thai for orders over $50.  Food arrived earlier than estimated with the hot food arriving hot and the Thai iced teas cold with no spillage.   We ordered the followiing: -Jatujak fried rice with added chicken and shrimp (additional cost) which was tasty -beef massaman - beef tender but it tastes like they use Chinese 5 spice, didn't like it. - complimentary fried spring rolls which were a little oily but tasted good with the sweet and sour sauce that came with it.  - Thai iced teas are always good and complement the food well. - mango sticky rice dessert - mango was ok, a tinge sour but the rice patties were oily and the coconut sauce didn't taste good at all; they should change the brand that they use.  Overall I was happy with their delivery service. I'm sure I'll order from them again and give them a higher rating when I find more dishes that I like."}
{"text":"First time here and it's hard to imagine good Thai food in this neck of the woods.  Jatujak has two locations, one lion Kingston road and the other on VP.  The only draw back to the vicinity is it's parking lot, it can be quite crammed due to the small shops along the plaza.  However, when walking in, Jatujak is quite appealing, clean, open floor concept, Thai Pan-Asian decor, and overall intimate aura. After ordering our lemon iced tea and green milk tea both JC and I were stumped on deciding what to order...if only I had the tummy or a sunk wrestler I'd eat everything off the menu. Thankfully Yelp came to the rescue, however upon asking our helpful server she recommended their popular green curry dish and their pad Thai. Both were a delight to our palates. Green beef curry, sweet savoury curry sauce with bamboo served with a bowl of rice. 4/5 Pad Thai, well presented, equal balance of flavors, not overpowering sweetness..4.5/5"}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant tucked away in a plaza near Vic Park and Lawrence.   I had previously gotten delivery from here but wanted to give dining in a shot. I came here on a Saturday night and was seated right away.  The restaurant itself definitely added to the experience. The chalkboard walls of Thai related tidbits and the décor brought me back to my trip to Thailand.  Here's what we ordered:  Chicken Khao soi - was very god and comparable to Khao san road and Pai's. You get a generous portion of protein.  We went with the chicken but you also have the choice of beef.  Pad Thai - Typical and average pad thai, it's hard to get pad thai wrong. Definitely on the sweeter side but satisfied my cravings;  Mango sticky rice - the mango was sweet and fresh. The rice was pleasantly soft, warm and sweet. Didn't dig the artificial food colouring of the rice but still recommend!  Thai iced tea- very good and authentic. Enjoyed how the drinks came out in mason jars;  Thai green ice tea- Do not get this. Get the original or red instead. It tasted very artificial and definitely made from a powder.   Overall, the portions are all very big and well priced (mains averaged $11) so come hungry!  The servers were inattentive near the end when we wanted our dessert and the bill but the food is still deserving of an overall 4 star."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner for 8 last night and it was fantastic. Better than expected along with leftovers for lunch today.  Highly recommend for take out or pick up. Price was very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Came here after trying out Kub Khao Thai and found out that they are sister restaurants.  I loved Kub Khao Thai so I was excited to try Jatujak out. There is a chalkboard on the back wall with drawings of popular Thai dishes such as Khao Soi - that is a cute touch. Food was great as expected. We had the pad kee meow and green curry beef. Both were delicious. Definitely recommened all Thai food lovers to try them out!"}
{"text":"Got the yellow curry with beef and it was delicious and full of flavour. It tasted similar to butter chicken, but also different in a better way. It was also a bit more spicy than I was comfortable with, but they left a jug of water at my table to wash it down. I liked how the menu was small so that you couldn't go wrong with any of the dishes you pick.   Would definitely recommend if you're in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Green curry with fish, lemongrass chicken wings, and the mango salad were my favourites for the night. The Thai iced tea (milk tea with condensed milk) was still a bit too sweet for my liking despite having asked for \"less sugar/less sweetened\" as some reviewers had warned. Would not recommend the shrimp cold spring rolls. Would come back for Thai food cravings!"}
{"text":"got take out from here, so i didn't exactly photograph it. but i saw it was around work. ordered over the phone, happy they accept all credit cards. ordered the pad gra pao aka the holy basil with beef and the rating is specially for that dish alone. honestly i don't eat Thai food unless it's from PAI or khao san road, downtown Toronto. i know pad gra pao is technically very easy to make but not all are the same. i will say though, it was perfect, definitely up there compared to PAI/KSR. their Thai iced tea was okay, a little too sweet and watered down - but still good. i highly recommend it and will be coming back for take out. i will say however, for Scarborough/Markham, the prices are considered expensive in my opinion. the entrée $12.95 and tea $3.95 was just short of $20 - that's almost downtown pricing. so wasn't too happy about that but the portions are the same as PAI/KSR, which means i still have half the container left.  the also have lunch specials and pad thai is on there!"}
{"text":"Food is boring, no imagination.  Seems like the food is cooked in a rush hence the lack of flavour"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this is by far the most delicious Thai food I've ever eaten. We had shrimp pineapple rice, beef pad woo sen and green chicken curry with coconut rice.  If you spend 30$ you get free spring rolls.  I will definitely go back there again soon... Hopefully very soon"}
{"text":"The food here is so authentic and delicious. Wow! Thank you for such a great dining experience! We had the eggplant fry, masanang curry, and the pad kee mao were unreal. One tip: skip the apps they weren't anything special. We got the lemongrass wings and spring rolls. I would t recommend them. Otherwise amazing food!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars based on the fact that it's thai food, in Scarborough, and it's hard to find nice restaurants in this part of the city.  I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and rice and it was pretty good. My only complaint was that there were too many bamboo shoots (?)... I'm not sure if that's what they were but it was like a thick vegetable with a strong flavour that I didn't like very much.  The food here tastes very homemade, so keep that in mind when you come here. This isn't salad king or thai express so if you're looking for more elaborate thai food you might want to look elsewhere. This restaurant is very simple and has nice simple meals (and nice decor too)"}
{"text":"Always looking for something great where I don't have to drive downtown and I've found it!  They say they are Thai Street Food fare and I must say whatever Thai street they are on, I want to be there!  It's small but nice is clean.  It's in a nondescript plaza with plenty of parking in front.  Service is fast and welcoming.  I ordered the Thai lemon iced tea which was cool and refreshing.  I also had the potato and onion curry (added chicken for $1) and it comes with jasmine rice.  It was a nice blend of sweet with a hint of kick.  The menu shows one hot pepper to denote spiciness but honestly I didn't think it was spicy.  The only thing I didn't like was the big chunks of onions in it - wish they made the pieces smaller.  I can't wait to go back and try a few other things on the menu.  They have lunch specials for well under $10.  Nice to know great food exists around the corner!"}
{"text":"Lot of respect opening in this terrible mini strip mall.  2 vacancies on either side.  The food is great. The cashew nut chicken feeds 2, $15.  Only reason I wouldn't return, the area is depressing."}
{"text":"Although they've only been open for a week, I had dinner here for the second time tonight.  I ordered their chicken pad Thai and panaeng curry; the only two entrees I ever order from Thai restaurants.  I suppose that suggests I'm not too adventurous but I'm glad that I tried Jatujak because they nailed these two dishes perfectly for my taste.  On both occasions, service was warm with genuine smiles. The atmosphere was nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. The food was authentic, fresh, delicious, and generously loaded with meat. Overall, a great value for the money.   This is my new favourite spot for Thai cuisine in the GTA and definitely my only choice in the neighbourhood. They have local Thai competition, which I'll leave unnamed because their food is barely edible.   Great for fueling up before or after going to the nearby gym. Parking is free and plentiful in their large parking lot. Lunch specials daily from 11-3.  Full liquor license if you're into drinking. I would, and will, bring a date here. You should, too!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing ! Portions generous! Clean place and bathrooms! Super super fast service! Loved it! Will be back !"}
{"text":"There are better thai restaurants in the city.  The food was pretty bland and rushed. The Thai iced tea was watered down too much. I'm seeing very inconsistent reviews with this place and I can see why."}
{"text":"They coined this Thai street style food and while I cannot validate that claim I CAN validate that they make great Thai food! Having worked for about half a dozen years in a Thai restaurant during my high school/college days I can confidently say that I am quite adept in Thai food. While there has been a huge surge of Thai restaurants in this city, there are very few impressive ones in this crowded space. This stuff is so popular you can find almost dozens of variations of Pad Thai in food courts, Chinese restaurants, bars, modern fusion places and of course fine Thai establishments. However, I can say with confidence that very few do it right.  Jatujak gets it right. The Pad Thai is quite a simple dish to put together but very difficult to master. It's a dish about striking the right balance of texture, aroma and taste. It's about being able to decipher each individual component through one of the former traits; like layers of flavours. The noodles have to be soft, delicate yet still have texture. You need that umami from the fish sauce rounded out by the sweetness from the palm sugar. Then a little kick from the bird's eye chilis and last but not least a little bit of tartness from the tamarind and a squeeze of lime for acidity. Jatujak probably does one of the best (and perhaps truest) renditions of the dish I've had in this city so far. Even more impressive was the Tom Yum soup. Sweet, salty, tart and aromatic with crisp vegetables and tender meats/shrimp. Again, extremely balanced. As well the stir fry's like basil chicken is nicely flavoured. Fresh, crisp and oh so savory.  Other than this being a little on the expensive side and perhaps lackluster in terms of service (yes, this is located in the coveted Beaches area so one would expect more attentive service) I would peg this as one of my favourite Thai restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Braving last evening's freakingly chilly windy weather to join a group of enthusiastic foodies at Jatujak sort of had its rewards. The interior looks like those airy beach-themed snacks-and-drinks cafes that I've seen in travel posters of touristy spots in Thailand I'm going straight on to the food because I was quite late, having gone down several stops South past Eglinton ave and Victoria Park ave before having to turn around and come back North. The inside was busy enough when I got there and it took abit to flag down one of the servers. I decided to order an appetizer, a main dish and a drink. At the recommendation of the dinner's host I got the curry puffs which I am so glad I did. For the drink I had a green iced milk and a Pad Kee Mao stir-friend noodle plate. I actually wanted to get the Gaeng Panang but decided that noodles might be quicker for the cooks to dish up. And just like the other folks at our table said, the food did get brought out quickly enough, starting with my drink and curry puffs. The milk drink seemed like regular milk with some sort of green flavoring added to it. There was this pink bubbly-gum taste to it and I just couldn't distinguish the taste of it. Some of the others thought it was green tea but it was simply nothing like that at all. But it tasted good! And it would be alot more refreshing in the summer. I loved the curry puffs, a soft crumbly double surrounding a slightly spiced-up mashed potato filling and these were served on a bed of crunchy fried glass-noodles. The host said it was like a cross between an empanada and a samosa and I don't disagree with that observation. And I liked the fried glass-noodles and had to tell the server not to take the plate away because I wanted to continue eating them, and I put the rest of it on the Pad Kee Mao. The Pad Kee Mao had this faint scent of lemongrass from it when I lifted the first forkful and it tasted good, flavorful enough with just the right about of spiciness to it. I haven't had actual Thai food in awhile but the experience here was new for me."}
{"text":"What a cute hidden little Thai restaurant!! Definitely would not have discovered this place if not for an awesome friend of mine who suggested it for a girls date!   I, ofcourse, order the pad Thai. Literally how I judge if I will like a place is by their curry or the pad Thai... Because that's basically what I will order hahahaha!   The pad Thai here was amazing!!!!! Big slices of beef with great flavor. Not any of the over frozen, wet icky beef you usually get. And the taste was all sorts of tangy, salty and sweet! Noodles were the perfect chewy texture that I crave. Can't say enough about it!  My friend ordered the pad seew which they were able to make vegetarian for her and she really enjoyed it!   The only thing is the best decorated, beautiful gorgeous dining space was a bit hidden. Hard to get attention of the staff, but I will say that they come in to check quite periodically. :)"}
{"text":"A very small restaurant with about 10 seats but I like the ambiance. It's cozy and cute.   The staff are polite and attentive.  We ordered pad thai (my favourite) and pad kee mao lunch specials. I actually enjoyed the flavor of the pad kee mao better than the pad thai. Both noodles were al dente. The pad thai noodles were chewy (awesome). The amount of chicken they loaded in the pad kee mao was insane! It was probably more than 50% chicken compared to all other ingredients combined! Maybe they noticed how skinny I was. The pad kee mao is stated to be \"two hot peppers\" hot which is the hottest on their menu but it wasn't spicy IMO. It has some heat but it wasn't native Thai hot. It was nice. They probably noticed I wasn't Thai and gave me the weak stuff lol.  I would come back here if I were in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Food here is really one note. We got shrimp pad Thai and the shrimp was very over cooked pretty much rubber. The lemongrass chicken wings were so dry and overly sauced. The first time we had there was good but the second time it's gross I am not going back there anymore."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food at a great price. This is by far my favourite Thai place in Toronto. So much that I drive all the way to Scarborough to get take out here instead of places closer to our house (granted it's only a 15 minute drive).   Everything I've had here is amazing. It all tastes authentic and is some of the best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. The portions are large and it's all made with quality ingredients.   The place itself is rather small but there is a sufficient amount of tables for eat in or you can take out and eat at home. If you are ordering take out give an extra couple of minutes on busy nights as they get pretty busy with take out orders."}
{"text":"This is Jatujak's second location. Albeit it's sort of not close to much, but it's a good choice if you're in the area. Their dishes are great, very authentic and sizeable portions for a reasonable price. We went on a weekday so was very empty but I'm sure on the weekends it gets much busier. They also deliver themselves or through UberEats."}
{"text":"Magnificent!  Massaman beef curry was best I've had in Toronto. Rich in flavour!  Delicious mango salad done 'vegan' style without fish sauce (I asked, happy they could accommodate)  Really great five star flavours!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Got this on Yelp and was told they deliver but they don't. They told me to use uber to deliver. Not customer convenient."}
{"text":"Small (but quaint) place -  we always get take-out or delivery and it's really the best in the Beach. The Pad See Eew is divine and all the curries are delicious. The menu is also not too long, but that's probably what helps make every dish so good - they don't spread themselves too thin."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Best Pad Kee Mao in the city bar none (has the wok aroma) with good chunks of meat. All the curries and stir fries are top notch, the lemongrass chicken wings could open their own wings place. The only dish that isn't as good is the Khao Soi (Sukhothai has the best Khao Soi I've tasted, though my sis told me Pai might be better). I disagree with the reviewer below me, the rice isn't dry, this is the long-grain jasmine rice, the best rice. Then again I guess it comes down to preference since I prefer Basmati/Jasmine/Indian/Long-grained rice over sticky/short/Chinese/Japanese/Korean rice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Thai restaurants! You can completely miss it if you were just driving by because it's in the dinkiest, tiny plaza. Don't let the dimly lit area fool you, this place is definitely a hidden gem.   I've tried most of the menu items but I usually order the mango salad, khao soi and iced tea.  The beef in the khao soi is always tender and juicy, and the spice adds the perfect kick to the dish. I've heard that some people dislike that there's so much sauce that it's basically soup, but that's exactly how I had it in Thailand, so I'm totally fine with that.  The iced tea has got to be the closest thing that I've found since Thailand, I can legitimately inhale three of them in one sitting.   It's a small joint that can get pretty busy around dinner time, but the service is always good and the food is fairly priced. They also do take out if you don't want to wait for a table."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it was great. The waiters were super friendly and service is great. We had had the lemongrass soup, jatujak fried rice, and red curry with chicken. The soup was less authentic as it had minimal lemongrass flavours. However the fried rice was amazing. It was packed with flavours and it's definitely something worth coming back for. The curry was on the average side; not enough of the actual curry and too much chicken. The curry that's suppose to be the hero got overwhelmed by the chicken. The Thai iced milk were great drinks and definitely a refreshing experience. We preferred the green one over the red (which tastes like strawberry milk). Overall, a great place and will revisit."}
{"text":"I love this place, the decor is nice and the food is great. This has the best Thai Iced Tea I've ever tried. Usually order one to drink there and one go take home. I got Pad Thai there, it was good, but nothing special. I would go back to eat again!"}
{"text":"thumbs up for being a safe work-lunch venue that isn't over-priced, or super unhealthy.  will likely see much more of this place over the next while, and looking forward to it."}
{"text":"This place is all around great. In fact, I'd say that the service is better than the food. The pad Thai is original street style as they claim.   The service was also amazingly fantastic.   At the end of the day, all of my needs were satisfie"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. You can easily miss this restaurant as it is located in a small strip mall.  Came here on a weekend didn't have to wait so that good. They serve Thai food. Got the khao soi, gaeng panang, mango salad, and esan sausage. For drinks we got the Thai ice tea and Thai green ice tea. I really enjoy the khao soi and gaeng panang both dishes were amazing. The coconut flavour in the curry just goes so well together. Can't say enough good things about these two dishes. The mango salad is good, a bit too sweet for me. It served with what taste like a shrimp chip. The chip adds a bit of balancing to the sweet mango and sauce making it less sweet. The esan sausage was the lunch special it was okay. Both the ice tea was really good, i would recommend getting.  Would defiently come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The neighbourhood, location, and exterior facade don't even hint at the cozy interior. The food! The few dishes that we sampled were very good, full of flavour. And generous portions. We'll have to go back to sample more of their menu!"}
{"text":"My favourite go to place for Thai food! Authentic flavours and lunch specials are a steal!"}
{"text":"I love it when I find an authentic thai restaurant, it's like having all those disappointing pad thai  I've ever forced myself to eat redeemed for the better. They don't mess around with the food here. I had the Khao Soi which came piled high with crispy noodles, a nice slaw that cut through the rich spicy broth and filling egg noodles. I think I was full about half way through the meal but just kept going because it was so food. The flavours are bold and spices used perfectly. My friends has been here several times they they are never disappointed with their choices. A great place to satisfy your thai food needs in the area."}
{"text":"we love Thai food and are very happy to have found Jatujak. It is now our favourite. A plus is that they actually provide free delivery outside of what they show, just check . We have now ordered 4 times from here and there has not been one item that we have not enjoyed. Tastes are excellent and the little touches that count, such as a hole in the container to let steam out, so that crispy spring rolls arrive crispy and not soggy! My son is just back from 4 months in Bangkok and we can hardly wait to share with him"}
{"text":"Delicious spot.  The masaman curry is amazing. They always have the freshest ingredients and everything has always been spot on at both their Kingston Rd. and Vic Park locations. Seriously, best pad thai in the city because they make it proper with tamarind, and not that weird tomato taste you find at other Thai places. Definitely worth the trek."}
{"text":"Food was great. Ordered online on Christmas Eve and the staff was so apologetic that it was delivered late, even though we didn't complain or say a word. We ordered a side rice not realizing that it already comes with the curry. Regardless food was yummy!"}
{"text":"The best thai food in east Toronto that i've found. Everything I've tried is great. The pad thai is more flavourful than at many places. The green curry has a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"Jatujak is the name of a market in Thailand (was told by our server) and in here; Jatujak is a Thai restaurant located in a strip mall.  A big sign \"Thai Street Food\" has been beautifully etched on the front window.  There is a big chalk board on the wall with colorful chalk drawing of a few popular Thai dishes and a wall with Thailand wooden painting.  The decor is mostly wood here.  It's cozy with dim light and a bit of natural light from the street. Jatujak pad thai has arrived first on our table.  It smells good. The noodles are chewy and besides smelling good, it does taste great.  The shrimps taste extremely fresh and delicious.  Gaeng Panang is a must try here.  It comes with a bowl of steam rice, but how would a bowl of rice enough for a curry this good?!  Order an extra bowl, or maybe two! The mango sticky rice here is very special and our server told us that it's authentic.  The sticky rice comes with three different colors, and are all made with natural food color (pumpkin,carrot and herb).  Instead of top with coconut milk, they serve with condensed milk.  I personally like coconut milk over condensed.  Thai iced tea here is too sweet for me.  Will request less sweet in my next visit. Excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for lunch. What an amazing thai resto! Ordered the basil chicken lunch special and the street style pad thai. Both dishes were on point and so tasty. All those lovely thai flavors were there. It was a great meal with a nice and new resto. The decor was modern and inviting. Service was fast and polite.   Its in a run down area/plaza but its a GEM. Come here and you wont regret it. I cant wait to order the basil beef. ***** 5 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Between a 3-4 stars. Tucked away in a small plaza in Scarborough, his restaurant is easy to miss.  It's rather deceiving on the outside, as the decor inside is quite trendy with a Thailand touch.  Pad Thai was definitely a 4, I enjoyed it a lot.  We also ordered the special of the day which was a steam curry fish with rice, the appearance was impressive and excellent, taste of curry was great but the fish itself was mediocre.  But hey this is not a seafood restaurant and for the price you pay the value is good.   Just bear in mind when you add chicken beef or shrimp into some dishes, there are costs associated with it-i think that's why I took off a star. On a side note, I noticed lots of take out orders and uber eats pick up, who wouldn't want some authentic pad Thai and fried rice?"}
{"text":"Small place on a dark strip on Kingston but WOWWW is it GREAT FOOD! It's small but well decorated, clean & comfortable to dine in also. I love Thai and can be more critical than most of it, and this wonderfully priced little place did NOT disappoint! YUM!!"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight & the reviews are right. We ordered the Mango Salad, Gaeng Penang, Gaeng Phed with chicken, and Thai Iced tea. Everything was good.  I had the chicken left over the following night & noticed some of chicken pieces was not all white but had some darker/black on it. Now I'm not sure will come back? That's why the change in rating & review."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight after seeing the positive reviews. The decor is nice and the place wasn't busy. The food is too salty and everything was sweetened, even the Tom Yum soup. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything we ordered was soo delicious. Red panang curry beef, green curry chicken, pad thai, mango chicken and beef salad.   This is the second thai restaurant that i love and i've been to a few. The place is small and because there's no second door we walked in to a cold room. But as soon as we ate the wonderful spicy food, we warmed up.   I will come back again. It's a gem."}
{"text":"I've had Jatujak bookmarked because it was listed as one of the best Thai restaurant in Toronto by a blog I follows, so I decided to try it.   Environment: Located at the 401/Lawrence neighbourhood, the area is quite quiet even though it is not too far from the Shops at Don Mills. Judging from the lack of Pokestops nearby, it doesn't seem like this area of town gets a lot of traffic.  However, the restaurant is really popular despite its location. We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday and were able to get a table for 3 easily, but by 6:30pm people had to wait for a table.  The interior of the restaurant is really charming and I like that they highlight some of their popular dishes on the mural on the wall. In terms of space, there were about 15 tables, but no large tables, so I think the biggest walk in group they can accomodate would be 6 people.  Food: So the big thing I noticed immediately upon taking a glence of the menu is that they charge extra for eats. For many of the dishes, it's +$2 for beef or chicken and +$3 for shrimp, while the default is vegetables and tofu. This pricing trick brings many of the dishes to close to the $15 price point.  We ordered 4 items in total: sausages for appetizer, green curry with beef and stir fry egg plants with shrimp for main, and mango sticky rice for dessert.  The sausages were decent but not very flavourful, though I quite liked the sweet and sour dipping sauce it came with. Green curry was really good, and just the right amount of spiciness for me. The curry had green pepper and bamboo shoots along with the beef that I paid extra $2 for. It came with a bowl of rice and it was perfect to have the curry with. The stir fry egg plants was really disappointing in terms of how little shrimp we ended up getting. We paid $3 extra for the  shrimp and guess what, we only got 3 pieces of them, which basically translates to $1 per piece. We asked the server about it, and she said they used to give 5 pieces, but they now have \"bigger\" shrimps so they dropped the quantity to 3. The flavour of the egg plants was still good though. The highlight of the night was hands down the mango salad! The presentation was amazing, coupled along with its great coconuty taste, it ended the meal on a high note. The mango wasn't fully ripped, because they need it to be a little raw to hold its shape, but it paired very well with the flavour of the coconut syrup.   Service: They took our order from an iPad to ensure the order tranferred to the kitchen correctly. There wasn't a designated server for our table, so we could call any server for service. However, since there were only 3 servers during the busy weekend dinner hour, it felt that they were often overwhelmed and it was difficult to get their attention.  Overall, I think the prices are higher than what I would like to pay for considering they charge extra for the meats. The only good dishes I had that night were the green curry and the mango sticky rice dessert. I wouldn't return for another visit."}
{"text":"Came back a year later and had the same dish, service is still quick and food is just as good as I remember. Always crave this when I'm in the area now."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch.  Finally an authentic Thai restaurant that I dont have to go all the way to downtown!! We ordered the Satay chicken, Pad Kee Mao(lunch special), Khao Soi and two Thai iced tea (one green tea and one red tea).   Satay chicken (appetizer) - it was OK.  the chicken was on the drier side but the satay sauce was pretty good.   Pad Kee Mao - it was really good.  its probably one of the best I had in Toronto, better than the ones in downtown Toronto.  It was quite spicy which I love and you can taste the different spices in the dish.    Khao Soi - it was alright.  Had better else where.  I find the curry sauce was on a sweeter side  , not a fan.   The Thai iced tea - i find the red tea version is better than the green tea version.  the green was too sweet, i felt like i was drinking syrup.  the red was good though, i would order it again  Overall, great service and the food came out fast.  I will come back to their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm not Thai, but from what I hear, this place is the real deal.  Jatujak is located in a small plaza on Victoria Park with really odd parking, but there is a decent amount of it. The interior has this adorable chalk art wall that was really fun to look at while we waited for food. There's an extra room on the side with seats so the place is actually decently-sized.  We ordered the pad thai and red panang curry. It costs extra for meat - $3 for shrimp, $2 for chicken and beef. Tofu/veggies are free.  The curry was so good. I like curry but I've never liked it this much. So flavorful - savory, creamy and smooth without being dense with a slight kick. This has one chili pepper on the menu - I don't do well with spicy foods but this was totally fine and definitely made the dish better than if there was no spice to it. You must get this. We got this with beef. (9.95+2 dollars).  The pad thai was good - not mindblowing. Hard to say because the curry was such a good first impression. The tanginess surprised me at first and it's very tomatoey and a bit sharp tasting. The texture of the noodles was good and the dish was very saucy. It was a good contrast to the curry - I think if I had the pad thai alone it would have been overwhelming. I probably could have just eaten the curry.  We got dessert after - the mango sticky rice. This was also really, really good. I'm still dreaming of it. Apparently I've had it before, but I totally forgot - clearly wherever I had it, it didn't leave an impression. The flavors are balanced really well - the sweetness and smoothness of the coconut milk, the texture and slight tanginess of the mango, and the sticky rice. And the dish is beautiful too!  Service was courteous, but quite slow even without the restaurant ever filling up. I didn't mind too much as I had time, but it seemed to take quite a while to get the waitresses' attention. We were almost done our curry by the time the pad thai came. Though the restaurant never filled up (Wednesday night), there was a steady stream of takeout orders.  Great place if you want to get Thai food!"}
{"text":"Thai foods are always my favorites. As this place serves halal meat, I always go to this spot without thinking anything. I almost tried their all menus. Love the flavours of different herbs. My favourite dish is Pad or Mao and Khao soi, also Holy Basil Chicken!!  But this place is very congested and cozy. Nowadays I have been observed new staffs and customer service isn't good anymore. Today I received no smile at all and been treated like they are saying Eat and Go kinda attitude! Very disappointing.."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food, for Scarborough. Large portions, strong flavours.   We had the pad kee mao (best dish of the night!), pad thai, red curry (which was not really that spicy), and the pineapple rice with beef, and the beef satay. I found that the beef pieces were a little too chewy/fatty for my taste but my dining partners seemed to like them. I also felt that the food could have been spicier.   But, it tasted fresh with lots of coconut milk, ginger, etc.  I would return if I was in the area, but I wouldn't exactly drive here from far away for it. Unless you were really craving Thai and there were no other decent places nearby (which may actually be the case in Scarborough, apart from Kub Khao). Service was hit and miss, but friendly.  Solid 7/10."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, what can I say?  And with so many \"Thai\" places serving up something that doesn't even resemble Thai food, I'm always hesitant to try a new Thai joint.    After reading so many reviews on Yelp, I was definitely intrigued.  But it wasn't until last week that I happened to be in the Beaches that I finally got a chance to try out Jatujak.  The store is small and easy to miss if you're not paying close attention.    We ordered Thai basil chicken, Pad Woon Sen, Lemongrass chicken wings and received free mango salad.  Thai basil chicken packed a nice heat with plenty of authentic Thai flavours.  Pad Woon Sen was also done very well and definitely stands head and shoulders above the competitions'.  I can't comment on the chicken wings as I did not have any but they looked like baked wings and not the fried kind I was hoping for.  The only disappointment was for the mango salad (which was free so I can't really complain).  The mangos used were stringy and made for unpleasant textural experience.    Will I return to Jatujak?  Yes, of course.  This place stands as the best Thai food that's closest to home."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night.  Decent Thai food. Flavours are good but kind on the sweet side rather than spicy considering it is Thai. Service is good but the place is pretty busy so sometimes seems under staffed. Had the pad thai and khao soi and also a sausage appetizer.  The sausage appetizers was a bit strange. The pad thai and khao soi were pretty good."}
{"text":"ordered:  pad thai & pad kee mao.    overrated.  overpriced.  overly-sweet! Buppha Thai is most authentic.  Try at your own risk- some of the yelp reviewers are either too kind or too \"good\" to be true!"}
{"text":"I order beef massaman curry.     Taste -nothing special or authentic about the food.  The flavour was too bland for me.  Price- too expensive compare to other Thai place I have ordered. Atmosphere-quiet and relaxed  Service-not attentive considering is Wednesday night.   Would I recommend? No"}
{"text":"This won't be a long review because all I want to say is \"best Thai food ever\" - the beef Holy Basil is fantastic.   Oh - and the staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"With a myriad of Thai places popping up across Toronto like bad acne, it's refreshing to see a few that put in the time to deliver solid meals. Jatujak, named after a market in Bangkok, has great food, affordable prices, and a relaxed atmosphere. Lines tend to form quickly during peak times so get in early if you want to grab a big table.  The Mango Salad, Satay, Panang Curry, Khao Soi and Pineapple Fried Rice were all top notch, big portions and a hit with everybody at the table. The only dish we found lacking was the Pad Thai which was had a bit too much Tamarind for our liking.   If you're in Scarborough and looking for an authentic, tasty, Thai meal, then look no further. Just remember to come in early to beat the lunch and dinner rushes."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jatujak. I have only ever had it as take out or delivery as it is close by my home and is kind of a small restaurant.   The green curry chicken and the fresh shrimp rolls are my favorite dishes and I feel that it is more fresh and authentic than your average Thai place in the east end.  The food is good, it's relatively cheap and has an authentic feel to it. I would recommend this restaurant but mostly just for take out and or delivery."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant out since I heard about it a couple of weeks ago. It has now become my go to place for authentic Thai food.   I haven't been to the Kingston location but this one is very clean - rustic feeling to it. It is very welcoming and the service is excellent. There was no wait and food was above and beyond what I expected. The flavours were on point.   I ordered the lunch special which is available on weekends too. I got the Pad Kee Mao (7.95$), Chicken Curry with steamed rice (7.95$) and Thai Iced Tea (3.50$). The Pad Kee Mao was delicious and it is my one of my favourites as I've had this dish at other Thai restaurants as well. The Thai Iced Tea was tasty and fairly priced - it's served in a mason jar which I thought added a modern touch.   I definitely will come back and try their other dishes. It's both affordable and delicious - plus excellent service and clean as well; which is hard to find in Scarborough. It is worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We came here last week with some friends who had been here before. It was our first time, but we'll probably be coming back more.  It's nice inside. We liked the way it was decorated. Also large, bright and airy. Service here is *quick*. The food was good as well. The portions are pretty big, and the prices are reasonable.  We got some spring rolls, tom kha soup, a pad thai and a fish curry. Flavour wise, everything was good! The fish was wrapped in some leaves, and presumably was steam cooked. It was pretty interesting. I think it was a little over cooked, but I still enjoyed it! As mentioned, the portions were large, so we had plenty to take home for my lunch the next day =)  I also had a thai iced tea, which was good as well. The drink i wanted to try, they said they just took off the menu because it was seasonal...ah well, maybe next summer, I'll get to try it"}
{"text":"Placed an order for pick up here for the first time, based on Yelp reviews. Meal did not disappoint! Loved the pad Thai with (nice sized, large) shrimp and cashew nut dish with chicken! Spring rolls were terrific...they even threw in some extra! We will be ordering here again!"}
{"text":"We love Thailand, Thai cuisine and are on what seems to be a constant search for great Thai fare in the city.    It's a difficult challenge because the strong base flavors in this type of cooking often mask the complete lack of quality in most of the dishes that we've tried at most restaurants.  Noodles, chilis and curry powder alone do not a good Thai restaurant make.  It's almost as if there's a mass subscription to the same mediocre Thai cookbook and still most don't know how to get it right.      That's not the case here.   At Jatujak, it's the high quality of ingredients that first catch your attention.  In many ways the high-quality of Ontario beef and chicken combined with the authentic street-cooking-style preparation creates an end result is arguably better than similarly prepared dishes in Thailand.    The menu is simple but thorough.   Service is friendly and awesome.   No line-ups.  None of the unnecessary chaos you experience downtown.    One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I'm in a similar boat to most reviews here; Kingston Road is simply too far for me, and I was glad they opened one further north along Victoria Park. Therefore I finally decided to try this place for my mom's birthday dinner.  We reserved for a table of 4, but honestly when we arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm the place was only half full. The ambience was definitely quiet as well; everyone can hear you even if you talk very quietly amongst yourselves. We were greeted immediately and were sat, as well as being given the menu and a large bottle of cold water.  Since we were a party of 4, we opted to focus more on the appetizers and less on the noodles and rice, since it would be easier to share the food. We had the satay chicken, satay beef, veggie spring rolls, veggie cold rolls, shrimp cold rolls, thai curry puffs, and a tom kha soup to start.  The satay beef was better than the chicken, although both were very juicy with the peanut sauce. The veggie spring rolls were also very good, in fact so good we ordered a second plate at the end. The cold rolls were decent, with the shrimp one better than the veggie (also comes with tofu). The disappointment were the thai curry puffs, it was a lot of puff and very little curry unfortunately. My dad enjoyed the tom kha soup and said the taste was quite unique.   For the main courses we ordered the mango crispy chicken stir-fry and the jatujak fried rice. The crispy chicken tasted excellent and it wasn't as spicy as I thought, which was perfect for myself who's a wuss when it comes to spice. The fried rice, however, was a dish I definitely regretted ordering, cause it was simply nothing special compared to the rest of the dishes.  We ordered the tapioca coconut pudding for dessert, which was unfortunately too sweet for us.  My visit came with a thai cookie for each party member to start. It may look plain, but it was quite good.  Service was excellent the entire way. We didn't have to tell the waitress at any point to refill the water, and she came back to us a couple of times to double check if the food was alright. The starter dish on the house was an added bonus as well.  I'll most likely come back for lunch in the future to try the pad thai."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai street food in Scarborough! We ordered the pad kee mao and khao soi.  I usually base my opinion on how good the khao soi is whenever I go to a Thai street food restaurant. It was great, good amount of spice (maybe too spicy for those who are sensitive to spice).  It was also very reasonably priced.  $37 total including taxes and tip for two of us! Can't get any better than that! We were full by the end of the meal as well.   Great atmosphere. It looks like a small place when you first walk in, but there are actually more seats in the back. Cool mural/drawings on the wall. Casual atmosphere. I'd definitely come back here if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is very good!  Authentic Thai.  Good lunch specials...fair prices...and very good service."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food ever The taste of the food is very authentic and its a nice place and people  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Jatujak is one of the best thai food I ever had compared to khao Sao rao and pau it is absolotuley phenomenal I will definitely come back here again the price is extremely reasonable honestly they cook with passion that's why the restaurnat is so packed amazing floors especially the khao soi and massaman it's like a foodgasm"}
{"text":"Comparable to suko Thai, awesome Thai food and very reasonable priced, kind of situated in a sketchy plaza but the food is worth it lol, it's authentic and portions are decent, definitely coming back to this place when I'm in town"}
{"text":"I love how places like Sukho Thai or Pai downtown always have crazy lines, but you can get some really great, authentic Northern Thai food anytime in Scarborough without the wait and at very reasonable prices to boot!   The dining room is cozy and has some cute artwork on the walls and chalkboard. It's casual and more inviting than your typical Scarborough strip-mall restaurant. The menu features some classics - nothing out of the ordinary but done really well. I recommend the fresh rolls, khao soi, pad see ew, eggplant (spicy!), and any of the curries. They are also good for takeout. Your food is usually ready 15-20 minutes from when you call.   This is definitely a solid option for quality Thai food if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I've had by far ! The chicken pad thai is to die for ! I'm gong to have to come here once a week atleast !"}
{"text":"We've ordered food here a few times and the flavours were good, but an incident was inexcusable.  The night we ordered there was a rainstorm. When I asked for delivery they made a point of saying delivery would take a little longer, about 45 minutes. I agreed.  One hour later (already 15 minutes late) I get a call from them. The woman said because of the rain delivery would take another 45 minutes. That's an hour and 45 minutes and we live 10 minutes down the road. They obviously just forgot about the order.   There was no apology and the woman was quite curt, it was \"just to let you know\". There was no offer of compensation in any form even though I asked. A simple 'sorry' would have been sufficient."}
{"text":"Have been searching for places in the east end that serve true street style thai food and found it here!!! No ketchup pad thai, just the real deal.. A serious must-try!!"}
{"text":"We were craving some Thai food and found this gem! The place is quite small and was bustling with a full crowd. I am always excited for Thai iced tea but was pleasantly surprised to find that there was an Iced Thai Green tea which I think might be more for my taste! The curry puffs which were hot, crispy and had a curry potato-like filling (not exactly sure what was inside). I tried the Khao Soi given that it also was a favourite on the menu. The beef was tender and the curry was flavourful with some kick to it. Overall, I had a great experience with prompt service, authentic flavours and great ambiance. I would definitely come back next time to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's the cutest little Thai restaurant!   We came here on recommendation from a friend, and were so glad we did. Fast service and all the staff are lovely! They have a really chill vibe here too, I've seen a few people come here and get work done, while others come for a quick lunch break with co-workers.  It's got a lovely quaint atmosphere when chalkboard drawings over all the walls. There's also an awesome throwback playlist always bumping in the background.  They have a promotion that if you check in on Yelp, they'll give you a free Thai ice tea.   You can get 10% off if you pay in cash"}
{"text":"Located in a sketchy plaza in North York, this restaurant is very popular with many good reviews so naturally, I had to give it a try. I don't have much experience with Thai food so I can't say much about the authenticity of the food but I enjoyed what I ordered.  My friend got the Khao soi beef ($12.95). I had a bite and thought it was very tasty. I tried a little bit of all of my friends' dishes and I think mine tasted the best!  I got the Gaeng masaman chicken ($12.95) - masaman with peanut, tamarind sauce, onions and deep friend onions. It came with a bowl of rice (too little rice for the amount of curry they give). The curry was delicious! I thought that there was the right amount of kick to it. There was also enough leftover for me the next day.  I think there's some lunch specials on the weekday that I definitely want to try out. I don't know if I'll stray away from my curry though..."}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai (w/chicken) on my first visit and the Gaeng phed (w/beef) and a Thai Iced Tea on my 2nd visit.  I rather enjoyed both dishes and the Thai Iced Tea was delicious but a little too sweet for my taste.   Great tasting food, Nice decour and atmosphere.  Definitely a little hidden gem that I will come back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"First off, the low rating isn't because of the food...It was good, it's real Thai not veit, reminded me of my years spent in Thailand for work. I went with a party of 8 so we ordered many dishes and shared them. My favorite was pla rad prik (fish). My low rating is because of their booking system. The night we went it was jam packed, we had reservations for 630 and arrived just before that. They either overbooked, or people we sitting for hours because we didn't get seated until almost 1 hour after. This restaurant is small, not much room to wait so between all the takeout customers and others waiting for tables, it felt like a crowded subway train. When we finally being seated, another group who was just getting their table as well tried to take a couple of our chairs lol. After a couple of words with them, we found out they were waiting around 45 min after their reservation time. Would I go back to dine in? Probably not on a Friday or Saturday evening, but I would do take out. Hopefully they have gotten better with their bookings, if there were more options in the area we would've left."}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai restaurants I've ever been to in Toronto. If you want authentic this is not the place. Very white washed food, more like a shopping mall food court recipe made for non asian eaters. If you just want a bunch of asian ingredients stir fried and served to you, then this is your place. Can't understand how such a place gets 4 stars. Had the pad thai - was way too sweet, very soggy, and over priced. Fried rice was also very mushy and soggy, but thats how non asian ppl like their rice. Rice was comparable to some uncle bens type of soggy rice. Tom yum soup just tasted like a normal vegetable soup. Thai ice tea for $4 was so watered down, just tasted like milk, water and sugar. I will never go here ever again. Feel so ripped off bc the food was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Thai food but not in the mood to journey for it I always find myself at Jatujak. I've been coming to this location as well as the one on Kingston for a while now and I'm never disappointed by the food. The one on Kingston is a much smaller joint with only roadside parking and limited seating but it's still a really cute/cozy place to have lunch or dinner. Coming to the one on VP, we were seated at their extended dining area (which I think is pretty new since it's my first time seeing it) and to be honest, it's a great extension but where in the world are the windows or any ventilation for that matter. Considering the amount of guests at the restaurant, it can get really hot in there. Nonetheless, their food is still worth trying and they also deliver/do takeout.   I typically get their Jatujak chicken pad thai $14 and  Thai iced tea $4.25. Their pad thai is so good - a shareable portion, sweeter and you can taste the tamarind. I'm always craving Thai iced tea and since there aren't any real authentic places that have it, you already know I'd pay $4.25 for it at Jatujak(although, I still find it pretty pricey). I also tried their Beef Khao soi (sp) and it's actually really good - the curry was really creamy and the beef was tender. However, I could do without the fried noodles or onions. I also suggest trying their golden curry (yellow curry) and mango salad!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to its downtown counterparts.   Second time visiting Jatujak, pretty much made a similar order to my first dine in.  - vegetable spring rolls - would skip not worth $6.00 imo  - Jatujak pad thai - shrimp  - Gaeng karee / red curry - shrimp   - extra white rice  - extra lime for the pad thai  - side of hot sauce - would recommend, not your typical white packet hot sauce    Pricing to a small degree is higher than surrounding locations but the taste, quality, and consistency is there. You can definitely taste the various flavors especially the coconut milk. Good quantity of large shrimp. Overall you will have an enjoyable meal. The staff are great, and the overall restaurant is quick on their feet.   You can either go downtown, pay for parking, and wait in line. Or you can go here which is conveniently located in the GTA ( depending on where you live ), with equal or better tasting food. Would recommend and would go again. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"One of the close to authentic Thai food around in the area. We ordered a Pinapple fried rice and and chicken pad Thai. The chicken pad Thai is good and favorable but the pineapple fried rice on the other hand is a bit too oily. It gave me a yellow oily lips after every bite I took. Apart from the oily side, generally their foods taste good and services are excellent. I would definitely will be back for a second time and tried other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Just came back from Vegas and had the best Thai iced tea there so I had high hopes for this place especially because of it's rating on yelp. I highly do not recommend getting their Thai iced tea. WAY WAY WAY overly sweet, it was kind of unbearable. Foodwise, got their basil chicken lunch special. It was OK, tasted like your average basil chicken. Just don't go in with as high hopes as I did. This 4 star rating on yelp was definitely misleading"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware!  I ordered a chicken pad Thai and a shrimp pad Thai to go. It came up to around $28.   The dishes had 3 pieces of thinly sliced chicken and 3 pieces of over cooked shrimp, respectively. To make it a \"shrimp\" Pad Thai, you charge $3 extra for 3 shrimp, are you serious?! My guess is, putting lots of noodles and less toppings to cut corners. I was trying to enjoy the meal as I tried squeezing the lime onto the noodles. EVEN THE LIME DID NOT MAKE THE CUT WDF! It was dry and barely had any juice.  I don't want to be bias so I will try to dine in to see if they're any different. I am starting to lose faith in these \"Best this, Best that in Toronto,\" kind of blogs   NO! NO! NO!  BS! All BS!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall in a questionable area, the restaurant itself is newly renovated, and inviting.  Could be a place plucked straight outta downtown, but...there's a parking lot!  :)  Bonus points.  Menu is pretty straight-forward with Apps, Salads, Stir-Fries, Noodles/Rice, & Curry dishes, all with brief descriptions.  Standard dishes were all in the area of $10-12, usually $10, +$1 for chicken/beef, +$2 for shrimp.  We got the Thai Green Curry (veg, ~$10) & Pad Kee Mao (medium spicy w/ beef, ~$11).  The smell was incredible and so was the taste!  There was such a depth in flavour with the Pad Kee Mao.  Medium spicy was no joke/cannot be mistaken for mild, so keep that in mind.  Green Curry was also very tasty, but I found the curry a bit too salty.  Definitely needed the rice!  Portions were quite generous, at least 4 servings per plate.  It took a bit of time to take our order, not a rushy-rushy place, but dishes arrived quickly between 5-7mins after ordering.  Really good place with authentic flavours!  Would definitely stop by again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"After the shutdown of original Khao San road, This is my new favourite thai place in Toronto!  The food is just just just soooo delicious, flavourful with lot of vegan options ! I have been to 2 of their locations, but somehow this location's food tastes best.   Start with TomYam or TomKha, which ever you like, my personal choice is TomYum. Their green and panang curries are so delicate and palatable.  No matter what I eat if I visit them, I always take home their Pad Thai, a perfect sweet and sour complete noodle dish.   Reasonably priced! Decent quantity and they do offer discount of take aways."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to check this place out. Overall I was very satisfied with my experience food was good. Only thing I can comment on is on the main course  khao Soi which was a tad bland but I have myself to blame as well since I decided to be adventurous and try something other then my usual Thai restaurant go to's. So overall good place I would recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered at tamarind beef and rice. The beef was super hard and inedible. I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"One girl who works there is very nice... everyone else has attitude problem. Good food though! Soups and curries are amazing and so is the sticky rice. The pad Thai is not good in my opinion .. too sweet."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food so my fiancé took me here. Amazing authentic food. They have a really cool vibe too with some unique artwork on the walls and chalk drawings of the popular foods being served. The service was ok. I think it could have been better. The drinks were also expensive. I don't think they should be serving cans of coke at 2$ a piece but I guess if your serving really good food you can get away with it.  Went to Pai for some khao soi and I definitely like it here better"}
{"text":"Over rated but some items are ok and others are not that good. The mango salad was the only thing that was good and extremely generous for the price."}
{"text":"My first Thai restaurant and it was amazing, although I still need to venture out for other Thai places but this place was so delicious I don't want to go anywhere else!   My partner and I tried two different dishes - chicken ghaeng phed and chicken pad Thai. Both were so good!   I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because the restaurant was very small and we chose to dine in on a very cold day - you can feel the cold air from outside."}
{"text":"The bestttttttt mango salad evarrrrrrrrr. I dream about it. I usually am not adventurous at all when it comes to Thai food because I don't know much about it besides Pad Thai and mango sticky rice LOL. But this place is so good I felt safe to step outside my comfort zone and order the Pad kee mao. A mildly spicy rice noodle stir fry with basil based sauce! Soooo delishhhhhh. Even my not easily impressed mom kept nodding in silent approval. An excellent uptown spot for authentic Thai food!   Restaurant is in a ghetto plaza though so beware!"}
{"text":"Very nice and authentic Thai food. Servers are friendly and the food comes pretty quickly. You can get a glass of REALLY NICE Thai iced tea if you check in on Yelp :)  We ordered Mango salad, Pad Thai, Yellow fish curry and Coconut tapioca pudding; The Mango salad is really appetizing as it is sorta sweet & sour, the Pad Thai is really nicely cooked as it is not too sweet. If you're not too hungry, both the main dishes could be shared by two people, especially the curry (tho you might want to order another bowl of rice) I would have ordered a second bowl of rice to go with the curry if I had the stomach. Unlike some restaurants who only give a few pieces of meat in the main dish for $10, they serve the curry with lots of gravy and pieces of fish, the seasoning of the curry is just right and the Coconut tapioca pudding is pretty unique in a good way... Their food is just simply awesome.   This place serves GOOD food with REASONABLE price, I'll definitely visit the place again soon as there are many more food that caught my eyes."}
{"text":"Pros: - Lunch items are a good portion for the price - 10% Discount on cash take-out orders - Good amount of seating - Nice atmosphere  Cons: - Was told different information about the discount from different staff  Ordered: $7.95 Lunch Pad Thai - Good portion size. Was tasty $9.95 Vegetarian Pad Kee Mao - Was decent for the most part. Regular size portion was roughly the same as lunch size  Conclusion: I came here for take-out at around 1pm. Ordering was quick and very straight forward. I ordered 3 lunch pad thai's and a regular size pad kee mao. At the cashier, there is a sign indicating 10% off take-out items with a cash payment. I asked the server about the discount and she said that the 10% does not apply to lunch items. When I went to pay, another server was attending me and told me the 10% applies to the whole order, not only regular items. That would be the only real negative from my visit.   Other than that, the pad thai was great with a large portion for a lunch item and the pad kee mai was good, not great. If you're hungry and think that the regular items are a bigger portion, just order the lunch item. I found that they are basically the same size. I'd recommend Jatujak and will mostly be returning for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Jatujak over the past 9 months with various reactions. Usually the service is quite good and the food authentic and nicely prepared.  The space is nicely decorated with an authentic touch! Food: Their Mango Salad is really very good. The Fried Fish is generally good but my last visit was not well cooked, resulting in some pieces raw. The Tom Yum was not as good as usual this last visit. Having tried a variety of items from the menu I feel that as they are getting more popular and thus busier it is not quite as consistent as when they first opened.  Hope that they get on top of everything as they grow as a business as there prices are fair and service is good."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night because of the reviews. Place is nice and clean, love the decor! Decided to get beef pad Thai since the reviews were so hot. Hubby got beef khao soi. Food was okay...wasn't too impressed about the beef, hubby too. Should have stuck to chicken. Khao soi had a good base but sometimes got full seeds of whatever was in there  Overall it was a nice experience. I would go back but definitely would not do beef."}
{"text":"I feel if this place was located closer to a more populated area like downtown, it could possibly become even more popular and loved. But looking at the reviews I guess they are doing pretty well at their current location although the place is quite small.  Service: Didn't have much interaction since I came on an awkward in-between lunch and dinner time (around 430pm) on a Thursday for a quick lunch before work, so I guess it was reasonable for the place to be completely empty, and food came quite fast.  Food: I ordered the green curry with tofu - I didn't like the type of tofu they used, which was fried tofu with a puffy texture, but the taste of the curry was quite good! and I'm saying this after having tried curries from the best and popular Thai spots in Toronto like Pai, Khao San Road, Sukhothai...etc  Overall: for the price and taste, I'd say its a great spot for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Didn't come into this restaurant expecting anything, especially with the offhanded middle-of-nowhere location, but I was pleasantly surprised! I came sometime in April, when the weather was decent and there was a lot of natural lighting filtering in through the window (not too busy either so we were quickly seated and served). The inside decor is somewhat styled like a cafe, with cute chalk drawings on the wall and both high-rise and low-level seating. I haven't eaten too much Thai food in the past so I can't say much about the authenticity, but from the few dining experiences I've had, I'd say it's pretty good. I got the Lunch Pad Thai ($7.95), Gaeng Karee Curry ($9.95), Tapioca Coconut Pudding ($5.95), and the Thai Iced Tea ($3.50). Good portions for what you're paying -- definitely a recommended place to go if you're in the area. Only thing is that it's in a bit of a strange location to commute to (at least by bus) since it's mostly residential buildings around, and there's not much to do unless you're going there specifically to dine at the place."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because of the great reviews it has. Well the reviews were right the food was delicious! I went with a friend that hasn't had much Thai and he enjoyed it as well. We ordered the green curry chicken which I always order this dish at any thai restaurant because I love it so. We weren't sure about the second dish to order so I asked the waitress to recommend something she said we should try the hot and spicy noodle dish. We were so glad she told us to get the dish because we both enjoyed it very much. The green curry was also  amazing.  As for the the place itself it's small and not much to look at but I don't care as long as they have great food which they do. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place once and overall the food was tasty and the ambiance was nice. We had the red curry, which was on the spicy side but asked for them to add more coconut milk and it was yummy. We're not very tolerant to spice. The Tom Kah soup (coconut milk soup) was delicious, I could of had several of those bowels for dinner. It was reasonably priced and the service was fine. I would go here to eat again."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Great food. A light in a 'dark' plaza. It's nice to have a place that good in that area."}
{"text":"First time here was about 6 months ago for lunch. Food was average for the price. Not bad, but not good. Decided to give it another shot tonight since we were in the area for a movie. Was able to be seated quickly and order was taken promptly. The staff try really hard to hustle but our order of 2 curries and a drink took well over 40 minutes to arrive, and only because we asked for the order to be checked. Our order was clearly forgotten since the server had to ask what we ordered and promised to put it at the front of the queue.. Food is not bad, but again, not good. It's slightly better than food court food. As we were still waiting for our food, an exiting patron said to some waiting customers, \"It's worth the wait\". I assure you it was not, and this guy obviously has not had much Thai food."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I absolutely love Jatujak thai food!   Everything here tasted amazing!!! It's hard to find a resto where I thoroughly enjoyed every single dish. Starting with the shrimp chips, super crispy and sooo good with the peanut sauce that came with it. The mango salad was perfectly seasoned, not too spicy. The tom yum soup was very flavourful, perfect on cold days like today. We also ordered the curry puff and I would highly recommend it.   On to the main dishes, I think we almost ordered everything on the menu.  If I haven't stress enough, I loved everything but my favourite was the green curry and the basil eggplant wth tofu. For dessert, the mango sticky rice was warm, moist and uber delicious! Best way to finish a meal.   The service was great, all the dishes came out fast. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Thai places in Scarborough. My boyfriend and I came here on a whim and were impressed. The decor is beautiful and the restaurant is quite deep which is not what anyone would assume just passing by.   We got the summer rolls which were delicious as well as the pad thai and fish curry. The portion for the pad thai was fairly large and well worth the price. Their thai iced teas were very tasty, quite comparable to Pai's located in downtown Toronto.   I would definitely come back again but would suggest for others to arrive earlier than 7 as the small parking lot fills up quick."}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price. Portions are huge very filling if one is really hungry. Try their coconut sticky rice if you can make room for desserts."}
{"text":"I saw how good the reviews were but unfortunately the food that I ordered was not the best. I'd give it 2.5. I got the crispy mango chicken and it was so overdone, there was no tenderness at all. It was hard and there was no meat or softness at all to the chicken. I did like the way they stirfried it and the mangoes were good but the chicken left alot to be desired. $11.95  My friend got the khao soi $12.95 and enjoyed her dish so I'm glad it worked out on her end.   Service was non existent after our food came. We waited half an hour to grab the attention of a server, eventually I went to the front and ordered dessert and paid the bill. We waited another 30min until out dessert came out (mango sticky rice) $6.95 which I enjoyed but man that took too long!!   The Thai iced tea was good $3.95 but too sweet for my taste, my friend really enjoyed it.   Overall not the best experience but at least the birthday girl enjoyed her meal! Highs and lows but what can you do."}
{"text":"Pretty decor inside but it's definitely not the best place to put a nice Thai restaurant like this. I would have expected it to be in a better plaza.   Aside from location and lack of parking, I really loved their food and their service was impeccable.   We were greeted right away even on a very busy night. I had a date night with the boyfriend and they sat us right away.   We ordered the pad Thai and the green curry.   Pad Thai: was amazing ! I've always liked to try different restaurant's pad Thais because it seems to be one of the staples and you really can't go wrong. Theirs was decent and saucy and a little tangy (something I love about pad Thai).    I definitely enjoyed it and would come back again to try something else :)  Green curry: Their green curry was so spicy but so flavorful! You know when you buy bamboo cans from the supermarket ? And they're the Thai bamboos? The green curry tasted of that !! It also came with rice! A lot of places don't come with rice."}
{"text":"I'm glad I'm not a luddite when it comes to embracing technology. That little rose gold, smart device in my hand is a world filled with surprises...and not just for broken English conversations with grandma back in the old country.  It's 8 p.m. on a Saturday and, after a bout of heavy shopping, my friend and I are driving around aimlessly in an unfamiliar, suburban neighborhood looking for a place to eat. It doesn't help that we're fussy foodies, so not any old place will do.  Well, thank goodness there's an app to solve this very first world predicament.  And so it was, with our trusty iPhones leading the way, that we chanced upon Jatujak, a cosy, but vibrant Thai restaurant hidden in a sketchy little plaza in Scarborough. Entering through the glass doors was like opening a Pandora's box of bold colours, chalk-drawn murals and modern decor - the place was buzzing, and despite the late dinner hour, we stood behind a short line of folks waiting to score a table in the busy 40-seat dining room.  Named after the largest outdoor market in Thailand (and supposedly, the world's largest weekend market), Jatujak offers a feast of flavours, paying homage to traditional Thai street foods.  You can't do Thai food without starting with a Mango Salad - ours was served in a dome-like crispy rice cracker, and was delicious, crunchy and had the right mix of sweetness mixed with sour. We paired this with a second appetizer of Thai Curry Puffs - definitely very flavourful with a soft interior, but in our opinion, a little too greasy for our taste.  For our mains, we went big ... with a side of Jatujak Fried Rice and a bowl of Gaeng Masaman, a mild Thai curry rooted in ancient Eastern cuisine. It's safe to say that we weren't prepared for the size of these plates, so dining family style is definitely recommended. The rice packed a good punch and definitely provided a fair dose of our daily vegetable intake. The flavors of the Massaman curry paste are drawn from spices that are not frequently used in other Thai curries, such as cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and star anise. This makes the curry not as spicy as you would find with other Thai curries. This one does come with a small bowl of rice, so we could probably have done without our extra fried rice order.  The service at Jatujak was quick, friendly and efficient - these folks are there to feed you and feed you well! As we packed up our leftovers, it was amazing to see large groups of diners still trickling in through the door. I guess in Toronto, it's never too late for some street-style Thai food."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. I almost always order the Khao soi with chicken it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Review is based on takeout.  Service was very quick, and attentive.   Food - ordered the chicken pad thai, green thai curry, and crispy spicy chicken. Overall the flavour was awesome, and consistent throughout. On an honest note, I found that the chicken was quite dry and tough the more I continued to eat. The portions were very generous. After ordering 3 dishes to split between 2 people there was still a generous portion left over. I would recommend their food for take out if you're in the area.   But because I'm comparing against other amazing Thai places that I've tried, I would say this is a 3/5.   p.s. sort of got cut eye when we didn't tip for takeout."}
{"text":"Trying to find a good Thai place closer to Scarborough, than Sukho Thai, I came across this little place. I read about it, and finally decided to go try it with a friend of mine. We're both die hard fans of Sukho Thai. She always sticks to the Pad Ke mao, and I'm always trying something different. We were both excited and eager, hoping this place would be a good local Thai replacement, when we couldn't go all the way downtown.   For starters, the decor was incredible as well as the aroma. It is the first thing you notice when you step into the quaint little store. I've drove across this spot so many times and never even noticed it before.   We both ordered starters, chicken satay and shrimp spring rolls. The chicken was tender and well seasoned, the peanut sauce it came with was delicious. The shrimp spring rolls however were disgusting. Mostly just lettuce, super dry and no flavour. After complaining about it to the waitress, who seemed rather off put by our complaint, the took it back and didn't charge us for it.   I ordered a Thai iced lemon tea, which was interesting. Very sweet, and thicker than usual. I just wanted to try it for the experience. Not sure that I would get it again.   For our entree, we ordered a chicken green curry and a chicken pad kee mao. Both of our dishes tasted amazing. The veggies weren't chopped up so well, but aside from that minor detail it was great. We even ordered some to go,.   For dessert, we decided to try the mango sticky rice. I had assumed it would be mango flavoured sticky rice. Was I ever wrong. It came on a plate looking beautiful, 3 scoops of different coloured rice balls, with slices of mango on the sides, and a sweet coconut drizzle. It was amazing. My friend and I couldn't stop eating it,even though we were full.   Overall, good experience, aside from the gross shrimp spring roll."}
{"text":"I came to Jatujak last year with a couple of my friends but I ate already so I sipped on a Thai iced tea and only ate the mango sticky rice for dessert.  I finally decided to return and came in on Friday around 8PM with my boyfriend and a friend.  Sidenote: They do not shovel their plaza when it snows omg.  The place was pretty much empty with a few tables seated and then some couples coming in for dessert.  The place has a modern but homey vibe which I love.  Seating is spacious and seems cleans enough.  The washroom is usable and very clean but you have to go all the way downstairs and it's like a creepy horror film corridor.    On to the food. We ordered: - Chicken Pad Thai: We didn't overly enjoy this as the sauce was ketchupy in the way where there was too much but tasted good [this does not mean the sauce is actual ketchup-the sauce is made of taramind base sauce with vinegar to balance].  The portions were huge though with lots of chicken.  There was fresh peanuts, lime, and beansprouts on the side.  Loved squeezing the lime juice on though, did balance out the ketchupy taste.   - Thai Iced Teas: Loved them, will always get them.  Great mixture of tea. - Satay beef skewers: It was okay but it wasn't grilled as much as I liked and I wasn't familiar with the sauce.  They had big pieces on a skewer with a yellow sauce and had a side of peanut sauce.  Won't order again but I didn't hate it. - Mango Sticky Rice: I was literally so disappointed as I loved this last time.  The mango was sweet and finely sliced & placed to form a heart around the coloured sticky rice. The yellow sticky rice was what I came to find: soft, sticky, and sweet with coconut cream.  But the green one had the butane gas taste.    Hope this was a off night and maybe because we came an hour before close?  I'll be back again when I'm in the area and give them another try."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in a casual setting. Friends and I came here for a really late dinner - right before closing. Despite the time, they said it was fine for us to dine in.  We ordered the mango chicken, khao soi chicken, Thai iced tea, mango sticky rice, and massaman chicken curry.  The khao soi chicken was good. The chicken was tender, the curry was flavourful, and it was a bit different since it contained coleslaw. Contained a lot of crunchy noodles which is always a plus for me. I would order this again if we came back.  The Thai Iced tea was a rather small portion and a bit too sweet for my tastes. I wouldn't order this item again.  The mango sticky rice was good, but the mango wasn't as sweet as I would have liked it. Nonetheless, the portion size makes it great for sharing and I would still get this again if I were to come back.  Boyfriend enjoyed his massaman chicken and friend also enjoyed his mango chicken.  Overall, for price to quality of food ratio, it's decent. I would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"i would give it a 3.5 rating. Came here with my boyfriend for lunch. I know they had a location in DT but they opened one in Scarborough so I was curious to giving it a try.  Thai iced milk tea ($3.50) This was noted as a must try from all the reviews I read so I gave it a try. We ordered the original, with red tea. It was REALLY sweet. Tasted great, but I wasn't able to finish it by myself as it was way too sweet. I've had Thai iced tea elsewhere and it is known to be sweet, but just a heads up to be prepared it is really really sweet.  Lemongrass Chicken Wings ($9) This was one of the house special appetizers. I was slightly disappointed in this dish. It tasted more like sweet and spicy chicken wings, as opposed to lemon grass. I rarely tasted the lemon grass flavor.  Khao Soi ($12) This apparently is one of the house specials so we definitely gave this a try - egg noodles with yellow curry, lime, coleslaw, onion and beef. I would have liked it a lot more if the beef meat was more tender, as it was slightly tough and dry. The curry itself was good, more on the sweet side meaning it was more of a coconut curry. The noodles were good. The fried crispy crunches on the top added a nice crunch texture to the noodles.  Pad Kee Mao ($8 lunch special) Another house special - hot and spicy stir-fried rice noodles with egg and basil based sauce. You can taste the basil and a nice spicy kick to the dish, but I felt like the flavor was still a little bland for my liking. The rice noodles were cooked nicely though, had that 'wok hei'.  Overall it was good - the food was authentic, service was quick. However, I would prefer visiting Malaysian Gourmet instead."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, for a guy who really enjoys spicy food, their mild green curry was definitely pretty spicy for a mild curry.  Their pad thai wasn't anything to write home about, but for sure their curry puffs were unique; rich with a soft chewy texture."}
{"text":"Came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Got the chicken wings to start, kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - Steamed fish coconut curry. Chicken wings were good, especially when hot, the sauce gelatinized as it cooled. Kao soi was the best I've ever had, an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender. The the fish coconut curry was good too, wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful. Service was fast and people were so friendly and kind. Will definitely go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Thai food in this hidden gem. Cashew chicken. Shrimp chips with peanut sauce. Awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was empty. We were quickly greeted and seated by a friendly waiter.  We ordered their lunch special and upgraded to their combo (salad, spring roll and drink) for additional $2.50. We had:  Basil chicken with rice - it was really good and the ingredients were fresh. I would ask for more heat next time I return back.  Pad Thai - my husband and I find it to be a bit too sweet, but overall a good pad Thai that is not made with ketchup!  Their Thai iced tea has a really nice aromatic taste which I loved, but my husband wasn't much of a fan. The flavor reminded me a lot of \"haw flakes\" if that helps at all.  Overall, great service and great authentic Thai food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear, the chief reason for my visit is so my girlfriend could get her hands on the extremely photo-worthy mango sticky rice. That aside, Jatujak is a charmingly low-key restaurant with chalk-drawings of the food on the wall, wallprints of traditional Thai figures, and a large flag of Thailand on another wall.  As it follows with my bad habits at a new restaurant, I over-order to edge out a little more on variety, getting the pad kee mao, khao soi, curry steamed fish, chicken wings, Thai iced teas, and the mango sticky rice. Overall my impression was that flavours were authentic; good heat and fragrance. Surprisingly, my favourite was the steamed fish curry. Served in a banana leaf basket, it was like a delicate and fragrant omelet with a bowlful of rice and some orange slices for garnish---a pleasant contrast from the oiliness and sauciness of our other choices. That pad kee mao was also a standout, with decently sized juicy and flavourful shrimp, and reasonably (and satisfyingly) greasy fried noodles and veggies (as if pad thai and ???? had a well-behaved lovechild). I initially felt the Thai iced teas were overwhelmed by condensed milk (my girlfriend comments that it does not live up to the real thing), with the much desired tea flavour arriving weakly in the aftertaste. However, sipping on this in between bites and dishes, I found it was more than suitable as a palate cleanser and a ground to which to return from heat---acceptable.  The mango sticky rice was indeed beautiful as my esteemed fellow Yelpers have captured before. Not being a fan myself, I found it a mildly sweet finisher of appropriate portion size and excellently plated. Definitely a date-worthy dish. Overall, recommended."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Thai restaurant I have been to!! The ambience was nice, service was amazing, and the food was even better!   I came here on a Saturday night for dinner with my family. The food came in a timely manner and it was delicious! I ordered:  Mango salad (HIGHLY recommend)  Chicken satay Panang curry (delicious but spicy!!)  Mango tango (Not only was this beautifully presented, it was delicious!)   Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Thai place in Scarborough/North York. Service was pleasant and fast. I enjoyed my Khao soi which was reasonably spicy but the nom yen (green ice milk) drink I ordered was nothing special, tasted kinda like artificial honeydew. They also have cheap lunch combos if you come before 3PM."}
{"text":"Come here and order from here often. I love the spicy green curry it always tastes amazing when I order it at the restaurant but sometimes it does not taste as fresh when I order it as take out.   Same goes for their mango salad, amazing in the restaurant not as good when ordered as take out.   But in general the food are very well prepare, expertly seasoned, and provide a very delightful eating experience."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time, and love it. Excellent quality of food andauthentic flavours. On time delivery always. One of the few places in the city with Khao soi. Just keep in mind that with it's authentic flavours, it's spicier than people in North America are used to. Even with my high tolerance for spicy food, I get a mild from here to enjoy the flavours.  I prefer this any day to places like Sukho Thai, Khao San Road and Pai, which I find to be more of low quality, mask-quality-with-strong flavours kind of places. However, we passed this restaurant once and didn't want to dine in. For me it's more of a delicious and great delivery place."}
{"text":"I got the pad Thai & my friend got their tom yum soup, and we shared a fresh spring roll. It was pretty good, nothing amazing though.   Was looking forward to their Thai milk iced tea but it was SOOO sweet (I'm saying this as someone who has a sweet tooth), idk if it was supposed to be like that but my friend and I couldn't even finish half of it. I swear I've tried it elsewhere and it wasn't nearly as sweet.   The service was alright, the girl who served us was kind of hot and cold towards us.  TL;DR - food was good, nothing amazing, service was okay. Only negative was their Thai iced tea was awfully sweet."}
{"text":"We went here on an early Saturday night without reservations, and the person I talked to was kind enough to accomodate us.  Their menu is very simple not to complicated, just a one page menu which just makes it easier to order.  Sometimes having the simpliest things is the best. And this is what Jatujak is,  simple, good and tasty thai food.  The service was awesome, fast, friendly and knowledgable staff. We ordered the following:  Thai iced tea: this drink was different in a good way, couldnt really tell if they use evap milk in it. But it did taste good and refreshing  Pla rad prik (deep fried fish w/ basil sauce): this was the crowd favourite, it was so good we ordered another one. Ya its that good.  Perfectly cooked fish with spicy savoury sauce on top.  Jatujak fried rice: decent fried rice nothing really special  Jatujak pad thai: good pad thai, but ive had better ones before.  Its still worth the try.  Gaeng kiew whan ( green curry): one the best green curries ive had, it had the perfect harmony between the coconut milk and all the other ingridients.  Not too spicy. So everybody can enjoy it  Pad see eew: my personal favourite, this noodle cooked with sweet soy sauce brings me back memories of the time i was taught how to make it from scratch by my aunt.  The sweetness of the soy sauce does not overwhelm the flavour of the dish.  I would have given them 5 stars except i did not like the ambiance of their second room.  So they have this second room to accomodate more people in the restaurant.  Problem is that it feels like a basement or a dungeon, they could probably try to make it more inviting and pleasent in that room.    Overall the experience was awesome and would definitely come back try other dishes."}
{"text":"Just a little personal opinion before I go on to my review. I think it's funny how some people.. who are not from Thailand, probably never been to Thailand, challenges the authenticity of Thai food cooked by Thai people. And said people probably forget that a dish may be cooked in so many different ways depending on region and personal preference. End rant.  One consensus about this place I can agree on is that it's COLD if you go on a chilly day. The place is on the small side, and not properly insulated either. We went on a Sunday during lunch, there was one other family there but other than that not busy at all. It is popular for takeouts as there was a steady influx of people coming in to pick-up and the phones did not stop ringing. There was only one person tending the front and serving, but she was still able to be efficient and friendly. We ordered from the lunch specials menu with the exception of Tom Yum with shrimp.   Padthai with combo (comes with pop/tea, mango salad, and spring roll) - decent size, very saucy, my mom and I found that it was rather too sweet.. but easily fixed with hot sauce on that occasion. Not the best pad thai but still beats food court Thai.  Red curry chicken - comes with jasmine rice, not my dish but I did have a taste and it was good.   Tom yum was my personal favourite, it has that nice sour/spicy balance I like. Overall, a solid place in the area if you are craving for Thai. Not the best, but better than most. There are some street parking right in front of the strip. I would return to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Very average. I tried this place 3 times and tried almost 75% of the menu. Wish they offered better quality of food. Sorry.....but won't be returning."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! Located in a unassuming plaza off victoria park, the curries here are amazing. Highly recommend both the khao soi and the curry panang with chicken. Other reviewers have raved about the spicy chicken, however the earthy bitter aftertaste wasn't my cup of tea.  But the Thai Tea and the Mango sticky rice... I've had some fantasic milk teas and street cart sticky rice in Taiwan (street food capital of asia)    and these have to be some of the best I've had. Not overly sweet but rounds out the savory curries perfectly. Even my parents were impressed and trying to find a new restaurant they like is an achievement in itself.  One thing I need to say is service is non-existent - at one point I had to go grab a water jug myself from the front desk. One of the customers even thought I was a server! I also come from a family that went out to chinese restaurants every saturday, so I'm used to bad service and why I focused my rating on the food only.  Great restaurant with a earm cozy vibe. Great for family outings or dates."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I love lunch specials!? So my review of Jatujak might be a little bias.   Jatujak is really simple and down to earth  take out place. Don't even come with a group of more than 2 people if you expect to eat in as there are only 2 tables for 2 and 4 bar stools... Capacity for 8. (they working to get a restaurant license to put in more seating capacity and for time being, it is really a take out place)   Lunch special starts at $5.95 and can be upgraded to a combo for $2 that's includes spring roll, mango salad and pop.   My friendly waiter recommended Pad Kee Mao ($6.95) Freshly off the wok, the dish is so well seasoned and flavored by fresh basil and peppercorn and made extra spicy by using fresh Thai chili. I can eat this everyday!!   The taro filled spring roll and mango salad both delicious.   For dessert, my waiter recommended Water Chestnut in Coconut milk - Tab Tim Krob ($3.95). So colorful and the chestnut has a chewy tapioca outer layer and crunchy inside.    I will definitely be back again to Jatujak for some authentic Thai cooking and hospitality.. Definitely the best Thai food in the area!  Make sure to your Yelp App to check in for a free Thai Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"Back to Jatujak for lunch and the experience was just not as good as before.   Maybe we should stick with the lunch menu during lunch? Crispy Spicy Chicken ($10.95) was just disappointing. The flavours was there but the chicken was dry and hard. Tasted not freshly deep fried and just from frozen pieces.  Pad Kee Mao ($7.95) was OK. But it was not as good as last time I had it?!  Service was lukewarm...  This just made me sad."}
{"text":"We were in the area in the afternoon and decided to stop by here for lunch for their lunch special. I had the basil chicken and my friend had the pad kee mao(spicy noodle).  Although both the dishes were supposed to be spicy, it wasn't really. At least not for me. Not a problem! The food was hot, fresh, and delicious! That's more important.  When you check in here, you get a free iced tea with your meal, which was pretty awesome. My experience with Asian restaurants is that they are often not too fond of giving out free stuff. The lovely young lady in the front was very nice about it and that was a plus.  It was my first time here and probably won't be the last. Though, I wish the portions were larger. I left the place not completely satisfied, and that doesn't give me the best of moods. I was petrified at the amount of goodness on my plate.  All in all. A nice little hidden gem tucked away on Kingston Rd. Small place with limited seating and street parking. Take-out may be the best option, especially during busy hours."}
{"text":"When you first step in, there are about 5-6 small tables, but they have a larger room that you can enter once inside the restaurant. We had about 12 people in our dinner party and there was 2 other groups of the same size. Just call ahead to make a reservation for big groups.  Last but not least, the food is goals. In terms of Thai food standards, they have won based on their khao soi, green curry, pad thai, pad see eew, and holy basil with egg. Don't worry, I'm not a hype girl so I can be honest with what I didn't like. I wouldn't recommend the fried rice (too plain), crispy chicken (not enough flavor), or mango sticky rice (looks pretty but doesn't taste like much). Also, the Thai iced tea looks pretty, but is hella sweet. It's pre-made so they can't change that but do try it! If anything, you have a pretty picture for the gram.   In Scarborough standards this place is 6 stars out of 5. Perfect for family when celebrating a special occasion or even for date night. I've been here countless of times since I discovered it and would go back again!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food, delicious pad Thai, best Thai food in Toronto by far. Definitely a hidden gem. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really delicious authentic Thai food. I loved the green curry. Portions were huge (much more green curry than most other places give) and they give lots of meat. The pad Thai was really good as well but the Thai iced tea is a must try!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Scarborough. To me, it does not matter where it is located, as long as a restaurant is serving mouth watering foods.   This place has delicious food that are reasonably priced. I go there every month or couple of times a month and their service has never disappointed me.  My favourites: Green curry and Thai milk tea."}
{"text":"Tiny take out, but does have seating, very clean, with a little waiting area for take out if it's not ready.  We had the red curry panang with shrimp, and the see ew noodles with chicken, and the coconut soup.  Since the bill was over $30.00 3 spring rolls were on the house.  Everything was outstanding.  Nicely balanced flavors in everything.  They have specials apparently all the time.  The menu is not large, but to me that's not a bad sign, as they can focus on what they make.  Not too salty either.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. Great service! I have come here several times and the service and food have been exceptional. I enjoy their green curry a lot. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not my favourite Thai place. The Thai ice tea is cute! The lunch menu was confusing! I thought it came with tea and spring roll but that is not the case. It is an extra $3, which doesn't seem like it's worth it. The pad Thai tasted too tangy like ketchup. The meat portions were good and I love the heaping portion of peanuts.   I saw the lovely pictures of the mango sticky rice but I haven't gotten a chance to try it! I don't know if I will be back but it is up in the air. Maybe I didn't pick the right dish because my colleagues look it! They really liked to soi something that looks like curry in a soup."}
{"text":"I got the spring roll as the appetizer, nth special won't try again. For the main, I tried the Basil with egg and beef, it is pretty spicy but it's really good. Highly recommend if you are okay with spicy food. also got the Gaeng panang, which is kind of like curry with fish. Curry is more on the sweet side, the fish has a crispy crunch to it; overall above average but would like to try other things on the menu next time. For the drink, I got the Thai milk tea. Little bit sweet but I like it.  Probably would come again."}
{"text":"Tried the cold rolls, tom yum soup and pad Thai. It was all great. Spicy, but delicious!"}
{"text":"Very average Toronto Thai food - nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I recommend the Thai Iced Tea ($4.25) and liked that it was served in a mason jar. The only downside was that it tasted a bit watered down, but was still good nonetheless and I finished all of it. I would order it again but ask for less ice.   I think I've tried enough dishes on my initial visit to get an idea of what the food is like. It's alright, not bad, but not good enough to prompt a second visit (for my personal taste).  Vegetable Cold Rolls with Peanut Sauce ($6.95) - this was very light & refreshing. The rolls are packed and are a good portion for the price. I love the peanut sauce that's served with it. I would've preferred something more substantial so next time I would go for the shrimp one.  Shrimp Chips ($4.95) - thick and crunchy with a tiny hint of spiciness to it.  Nam Tok Nua/Spicy Beef Salad ($11.95) - consists of beef, lettuce, onions, tomato. The beef is tough and chewy.  Lemongrass Chicken Wings ($9.95) - comes with 7 wings. This is good as a shared appetizer. I wouldn't eat more than two because it's very sweet and saucy. I think it was supposed to be a little spicy but I didn't taste it.  Tom Yum Soup ($6.95) - exploding with spicy/sour flavours as tom yum soup should be. We added chicken (+$1) and shrimp (+$2). The chicken was a good choice because there was A LOT of chicken added to it, but only two pieces of shrimp.  Jatujak Pad Thai ($11.95) - added chicken (+$2). This was my second time trying this dish. The first time I tried it was takeout and I didn't eat it until almost 1.5 hrs later. It was still so delicious with strong flavours! I was excited to have it fresh this time but it tasted different. It almost tasted too sweet. However, it was still good and the portion is HUGE. Definitely something to share between a few people.  Pad Kee Mao ($11.95) - dish is moderate tasting, a little bit spicy. I would say skip this dish, there's nothing unique about it. Again, it's huge and definitely meant for sharing.  Khao Soi (Beef - $14.95) - egg noodles with the perfect texture in a yellow curry sauce, topped with crunchy fried onions (I think). This was pretty good. I enjoyed the crunch factor and would recommend it. The beef was a little tough so I avoided it.  Gaeng Kiew Whan ($11.95) - this is a green curry dish served with rice. I thought this tasted really good. Again, this is a big portion and we even got additional rice to pair with the curry.  The staff were friendly and considerate. We thought we would be neglected since we weren't in the main room but they kept coming by to see if there were any empty plates to take away and if we needed refills etc."}
{"text":"A very average experience, nothing really stood out. For what it is, the food seems a bit pricey but is inline with the other Thai restaurants in Toronto. Having been to Thailand in the past, would pass on getting Thai food anywhere else.  Asked for dark meat in the curry but it felt dry and rough, was similar to the texture of chicken breast rather than thigh. Best part of the meal was the mango salad. The mango was not overly sour and was just ripe, not too soft. The sauce and the red onions was just perfect. Would definitely recommend trying this appetizer.  Overall, determined not a fan of Thai food so won't be coming back. Nothing really wrong with the restaurant but it didn't leave an impression that there needed to be a second visit."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday sit-down dinner.   My friend and I were feeling Thai that night, so we looked towards Yelp to locate a place around Scarborough and we stumbled upon this hidden gem!  What a great place! Between the delicious food, reasonable prices, decor and friendly (not to mention accommodating) staff, what is there not to love?  We ordered the mango salad, Jatujak pad thai and the black pepper and garlic beef with white rice. Everything was just so yummy and very authentic-tasting. Also, the portions were huge!!!! A great place to share your meals, which was exactly what we did.  Staff were really attentive, accommodating and super friendly!  Bonus: no posted parking signs along Kingston, which I assume = free parking! Also, receive a free thai iced tea when you check in (YUM!)"}
{"text":"I've often visit this branch and they've never let me down in terms of quality of food. However, today I decided to bring along my family to try out the cuisine here. The whole meal was delightful and we had a great time with tons of praises for the food. The issue occurred when the bill came, the restaurant adds a 15% tip when you're a party of 6 and above. We were only a table of 5. The waitress did not tell us that the tip was included as the menu clearly states that the tip is added for parties of 6 and up. After that, she watches as my brother puts in the tip for the bill and just grins so we ended up tipping 30% tip. When we asked why the tip was included and if we could redo the bill since there was an error, she just says \"oh sorry we can't do anything now\". We left the restaurant feeling tricked. This explains my 2 star review, a restaurants rating should depend on the quality of service as well not just the taste of the food."}
