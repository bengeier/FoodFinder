{"text":"World-class cuisine. Felt like I was eating like the rich and famous. The food came out looking like something in the movies. Tiger Cry Salad started the trip to flavor town. The Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai and orange chicken along with sticky rice were all incredible. It is a comfortable, friendly atmosphere and the food is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!   Lunch specials till 3, we go at least twice/week....great food, especially their curries....panang is awesome!  Red is very good but don't care for the eggplant pieces.   Server is always SO nice, and helpful but doesn't 'hover'...love that too!~"}
{"text":"Great Food, Nice People. So happy they opened in my neighborhood. We've been lacking great Thai Food and Tom Yum is delicious and authentic!   Give them a try. This place is great!"}
{"text":"I may have officially converted to this place from a neighborhood competitor, Sala Thai. I've eaten here twice - once dine-in and once to-go, and have enjoyed the red curry with chicken, pad thai and spring rolls.   When we dined in we were initially the only customers in the place and we waited forever for our food, so that would be the one caveat. That wasn't the case when I walked in and ordered to-go, however. That order came up in minutes. Hope they make it - the 32nd Street/Bell-Union Hills area is a culinary wasteland."}
{"text":"Literally saw a cockroach crawl across the counter as I walked in to place a 'to go' order!! When I informed the waiter, all he could say was sorry under his breath then proceeded to charge full price!"}
{"text":"Authentic curries. Not overly sweet. Good portions. Spice level accurate. Clean and cute with great service. This is our new favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"I had a vegetable dish with BBQ pork and my wife had a red curry dish with tofu. We both enjoyed our meals a lot. There was a very extensive menu and the prices are good. We both were served our meals at the same time which seems to be very unusual for Thai restaurants anywhere I have ever been. I would return."}
{"text":"The food was great, had the panang and it did not disappoint. The thai iced tea was very delicious and the presentation was equally superb.  I also ordered the sticky rice with mango and it was great. The place is small and the prices are very affordable. The day i went there was only one waitress and it seem that she had her hands full but everything arrived in a reasonable time. I recommend this place, the food is great even if you have to wait a little."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after eating at a different Thai place on Bell Rd where everything tasted like it had been precooked, frozen, and then nuked. Chef Ramsey would be appalled! Lol! Their pad thai had cilantro in it for gods sake! But Tom Yum knows how to do Thai food right!!   This food tasted and looked very freshly made (and with no cilantro)! The tofu was tender on the inside like it should be. The spring roles were crispy and tasty. Everything was very good! I ordered takeout, didn't have to wait too long, and everything was still piping hot when I got home. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly. They invited me to sit down and she even sat down too and chatted with me for a few minutes.   It's tucked back in a little from Bell Rd so it's not easily seen from the street but I hope they get plenty of business in spite of that and stay open for many years to come. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet very well maintained restaurant with a clear menu. The food was prepared to our expectations. They managed to serve a big group (we were 10) very well. Highly recommended and I will be back for our next team lunch!"}
{"text":"I had the yellow chicken curry. It was not flavorful. The rice from my sticky rice and mango was overlooked"}
{"text":"Ordered a \"pot\" size soup to go. Was told by the employee that the soup would feed 4 and he refused to show what their pot size looked like. After we got our $16.64 mixed seafood soup we can see why. The soup was only enough for 2 regular sized bowls. I have a photo of the soup in the to-go container with a dollar bill to demonstrate the actual size (32 oz). Although the soup was tasty, we  feel it was over priced for the amount of soup."}
{"text":"First time trying this place...  the pad Thai and coconut soup was so good!! It was delivered faster than expected which was awesome. Definitely will eat here again"}
{"text":"After hiking the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim in a day my body needed to rebuild.  I limped in here on the way to the airport to get my proteins.  I got a satay order and combination curry.    -Good portions  -Tasty  Owners were socializing with their friends but greeted all the customers.  I would stop here again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very solid Thai restaurant. Got the pineapple duck curry and the green curry - which were both great. Since it was our first time we weren't sure about the spicy level so we ordered one mild and one medium. We ended up adding spice to increase the heat on both - next time we'll go up a level."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Summer roles perfect, chicken coconut soup is rich and delicious. Many dishes including  the Green Curry has eggplant which provided a unique twist. To the reviewer who was upset that 1 peanut sauces is not enough. This is the best peanut sauces I have ever had so I understand the desire for more , which I would happily pay extra for. I will be back"}
{"text":"I ordered green curry and papaya salad. Green curry was good, but papaya salad was tasteless, with no flavor, no kick or punch or hint of any spices, chili lime. I had ordered all my food with spicy option. But delivery was on time."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch specials. The red curry is awesome and the staff is very friendly. The medium spiciness level was perfect for me as I have had some curry that was either too bland or too hot."}
{"text":"This is some of the best yellow chicken curry I have ever had.  I called in my order and it was ready when I got there; since I was hungry I ate it in my car like a desperate starving person.  I had been asked what spice level I wanted and I said medium which happened to be pretty spicy-- but perfect for me.  The coconut milk had a beautiful sweetness the sauce was the perfect thickness and like I said the spiciness complimented everything very well.  Lots of chicken, thick potatoes and perfectly cooked carrots made up some of the best tasting curry you will ever have."}
{"text":"Best Thai Restaurant in North Phoenix. Fresh vegetables and most perfectly cooked shrimp in any dish."}
{"text":"I ordered red curry and the appetizer combo platter. The food was just okay. Not bad, not great. Delivery was prompt."}
{"text":"Got take out here one night. Ordered by phone and was given a 10-15 min wait time. Arrived in said time and food was ready. I got crispy tofu and the pineapple curry duck. I love tofu. This dish came with a nice thick peanut dipping sauce. The tofu wasn't overly crisp; it was just right. The curry dish was very tasty as well. The duck came with the skin and it was tender. I wish there was a little more duck. There was also pineapples, green peppers and onions. It had enough sauce and veggies that I ate it in two days. On the second day I used my own protein to add as there was plenty of curry. Overall a great place to order. Would definitely eat here again. Looking forward to trying noodle dishes next!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The crab fried rice is delicious and the portion is very large. The Crab Rangoon was also good, as were the spring rolls. My boyfriend got the chicken fried rice and he said it was very good too. I feel bad for where they're located, because it's so hard to see them from the road that they're probably not getting a lot of \"passing\" traffic. But they do deliver, and it is worth driving to them... they're in an easy location to get to, with plenty of parking... they just need to invest in a bigger sign!"}
{"text":"This place I have to three times already. I really was excited for a good Thai restaurant in the area. The food is good, don't get me wrong, but tonight the service was horrible. The lady that waited on us was more interested in sitting with a party in the back than she was being attentive to customers. I can't even begin to tell you how irritating that is... I'll give it one more time and that's it. Restaurants need to step up their game now a days, way to competitive for this nonsense!"}
{"text":"Happened to pass this place on my way to a friend's house last weekend and thought \"oh! New Thai place to try\"...so, tonight we are back!  I opted for the drunken noodles, medium spicy...we also got the Panang w chicken and an order of crab rangoons.  The drunken noodles were pretty good; I wished they were a bit spicier and had more noodles (it was mostly veggies) but the flavor was really great!  The panang was good, I would consider it fairly average.  What was WAY better than average??  The crab Rangoon's.  I am not kidding, the filling and the sauce to dip them in are out of this world!!  Incredibly delicious!  They also got bonus points for throwing in soy sauce upon request...we usually just get one packet but they really hooked it up!  Next time we agreed to try the pad Thai, the green curry, and one of the soups, so stand by for the next update!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Good food. Your choice of for hot/spicy you want it. I got the Hawaiian rice - it was great. Big portion. Boyfriend had pad Thai - really good. The shrimp pieces were large. Wish there were some more noodle options and less soup."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. We got an order to go but the inside was decorated nicely and seemed very clean. Would probably also dine in. Staff was very friendly. We ordered veggie rolls, Tom ka soup, ginger fantasy and spicy basil with shrimp. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have ever had. The fish was cooked to perfection. The coconut soup was mouth watering. Everything is fresh. Presentation was awesome. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this place and regretted it. Calamari was like fried onion rings had never had it served that way. Was really greasy and gross. The soup was just alright."}
{"text":"Thai, nicely executed. I had the green curry and one other curry, I forget which. I got medium hot but it wan't very hot. Next time I'll go full on.  UPDATE:  I went back and accidentally ordered the green curry without specifying that I wanted the chicken curry. The default was the disgusting Tofu. Ugh.  Unless you are a glutton for punishment specify the *chicken* curry!"}
{"text":"Love the food and price not so high, I will continue to order my tiger salad and paithai  every Friday :)"}
{"text":"Consistency in a wonderful Thai food experience.  Just finished dinner and it was great.    Splendid curry and great orange chicken plus the best drunken noodles in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"I frequently come here to get a carryout or delivery... Well I did. I usually order brown rice with veggies with peanut sauce and summer rolls with an extra side of peanut sauce. Last night however, I asked if they put the extra peanut sauce and I was told \"NO! That is not how it comes, it comes with one teriyaki and one peanut\" I replied \"but I don't like the teriyaki, May I please sub it for the peanut sauce?\" he still replied NO.... I was shocked, I come here at least 4 times a month and haven't had this problem. I got home and realized they gave me white rice instead of the brown rice that I paid extra for. My veggies with peanut sauce was all cabbage, there were only 2 pieces of broccoli and a few carrots and some pods. My summer rolls typically have greens and iceberg lettuce but was only iceberg and they forgot my shrimp.   Congratulations on losing my business!"}
{"text":"I wanted this to be better than it was. The folks there were super nice and helpful. When we got there we were the only other people eating. We ordered our food to go. I got the yellow curry, and my family got chow main and fried rice. The noodle and rice dishes were good, the yellow curry was pasty and not what I expected. I was hoping for creamy.  Not sure we will try it again. :("}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai place! The food is always great. But today I was disappointed because I was really craving this place and they put up a sign that says they they are opening at 4:30 PM? It's unfortunate, they did this. It clearly says open Sundays from 11-9 so? So disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. For appetizers I got the veggie rolls and they were delicious and perfectly crispy and my husband got the hot and sour soup which was probably the best hot and sour soup we've ever had, it was full of chicken and the broth was extremely flavorful. For our dinners my husband got the Hawaiian fried rice and it was very good and big portion, he ordered it hot and it was the perfect spicy for him. I ordered the yellow curry and it was very good. I can't wait to eat leftovers today.   I hope more people realize this place is open because it was pretty empty. The service was great, the menu prices were a little confusing as it looks like they got their menus printed without prices on it and so they had to manually write it in with marker but messed up on a few."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant 2 weeks ago. I met the new owners. The panang curry was really good as were spring rolls. I will order from here again."}
{"text":"Chow mein is delicious!!! Only been here twice, and  both were very pleasant experiences. Everyone's  friendly and weve liked our meals each time"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant. I started with Sala Thai, then converted to Thai Basil, but now this is my favorite of the 3 near my home. I've ordered twice from this restaurant, Once with a party of 4 and the other with my wife and I. My wife loved the Ginger Fantasy so much the first time that I got it for her the 2nd time. However, I ordered different dishes both times. All food on both occasions for everyone involved was perfect. The portions are good, especially if you order fried rice. Their Thai Iced Tea is done very well, too. Give this place a try!  :)"}
{"text":"The people that run the restaurant are very friendly, and the food is great.  The Pad Thai is some of the best I've ever had, with the medium heat level it was perfect.  The crab Rangoon are crispy and tasty and the Tom yum soup is good as well"}
{"text":"We just tried this cute place for the first time. Quick for takeout and delicious! I had the yellow curry and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. We had the Pad Thai too and the tofu was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is killer!!! If you love the local hidden gems half as much as I do, this is the perfect place for you. The best Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai I have had. Quaint spot that is perfect for a quiet night out. Perfect place to grab dinner then hit the movies. Customer service has gotten even better with the new owners. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious green curry. Lighter than most like a soup. Spice level of medium was perfect. They added fresh garlic because I asked and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the food. This is a small family run joint. Good place to stop and get some grub before or after going to the Harkins theater next door. And people bitching about the prices...shut the fuck up already, or go McDonald's."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service. Good pricing and good portion. The place is clean, and staff is very tentative. It's like a hidden gem for me. I've been to several Thai places with high rating, but their food tend to be a little too salty for me. But here, the food is not salty, but just right for me. My favorite green curry was very flavorful. And they do offer delivery, too ;) highly recommend for everyone to try this place out :)"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in 5 years. Thai is my favorite and that being said it is extremely hard to find places that do it right. The food is by far best in north Phoenix. Tom kah was so flavorful, massaman just the right amount of peanut flavor, and spicy basil perfect. I'm not gonna stop going here until I've tried everything."}
{"text":"In the mood for Thai so thought I would stop in for the first time. Pretty small place and not many people inside. Bad indication for a Saturday night. I tried my favorite, Chicken with Yellow Curry. Service was pretty quick. They brought a decent sized entree with white rice. The broth of the curry although flavorful, was too watery. Curry should be thicker not soupy. The chicken seemed over cooked or just poor quality or not very fresh. It was not very tender and a bit on the dry side. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here 3 times now. Once was lunch delivery to my work- which was actually the best so far and arrived on time. Fam & I have tried Pad Thai, Red curry, Massamun curry, drunken noodles, chicken & shrimp satay (my faves) and lots of veggies & rice. Everything has been yummy so far, but it's still not Yupha's- our Valley fave."}
{"text":"This is an amazing hidden gem! The food is extremely tasty and the servings are just the right amount. The food tastes fresh and has amazing flavors!   If your looking for authentic and tasty Thai food. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"It was aight, great food, great service, I think I ordered their noodles or something at it ended up tasting pretty good"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from there a hand full of times and actually would rate them a 3 or 4 star based on their food quality, but the last two times I've ordered I had to cancel my order after waiting over an hour for my food to be delivered. Both times I ordered online through Eat 24 and the first time I was told the driver got into an accident. I was disappointed because I had waited over an hour for my food, but I definitely understood how serious of a situation it was! I was offered to come pick up my order, but I was working through lunch and needed delivery. Same thing happened earlier this week, I was working through lunch and had waited over an hour. When I reached out to find out where my order was I was told \"they had an emergency with the driver.\" If you're not going to deliver my food, please don't take orders. I like their food, but I'll probably never order here again."}
{"text":"Very unique and tasty blend of food! Best Thai food in Arizona! Yellow curry was the best I ever had!"}
{"text":"Second time here now. Had pad Thai and red curry. Food was amazing and great service. A tad bit pricy but it is great food"}
{"text":"This morning we walked in and waited and waited for someone to come out of the kitchen to seat us ... No one showed, so we left. We could hear them talking and we called out. There is even a doorbell that rings when the door is touched ... Nothing ... Will never be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite in the valley.  Have been searching for great thai and this is it.   Three of us all agreed.   Yellow curry with chicken, summer rolls and Tom yum."}
{"text":"AWSOME place  The normally close at 9 pm  We got there group of 4 ppl at 8:40 starving  The owner was there and kept the door open for us and even asked from his employ to stay a little bit longer and helped him to serve us.  He told us that he took over this place 2 weeks ago and look like he care about the business a lot  The food was very good not to expansive . The portions of the food are very big so one order will be enough  The level of spicy is not crazy like other Thai places I have been  So 4-5 will still be good  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Yelpers!  Score!  Thanks to the previous reviewers for the recommendation.  Very clean location in a \"strip mall\" - comfortable seating and clean - very clean!!  Score again!  Service was great.  Only \"concern\" would be if the place got really busy - our server/hostess/cashier would have a hard time keeping up.  For us - she handled things perfectly.  We ordered the Tom Kha Guy (spelling?) chicken coconut soup.  Spot on.  Chicken Satay.  Sauces were great - the chicken was a little overcooked - but still tasted fantastic.  I ordered the green curry and asked for additional veggies.  VERY  good!  Dining companion ordered Red curry and loved his food as well.  A third ordered a ginger stir fry.  Very good.  All of us were very full and took home a little for later snacking.  One of my new favorites for Thai in Phoenix!  This is a hidden gem - check it out!"}
{"text":"I never do reviews unless it's really called for, but after eating Tom Yum's food for the second time I have to say.... YUM! The first time I picked it up and the second order was delivered. Both times I have been sooooo happy with the food. I've had the yellow and panang curry now and they were so delicious. The drunken noodles were drier than I've had, but very flavorful. It's my fault I'm sure though...I've been a wimp since I had my daughter, so I opted for mild. I'll get at least medium for sure next time. I haven't been a huge pad thai person since I was a youngster, but you have to try it! So good!! Best I've ever had. When you order it may seem pricey... it's a lot of food though and so worth it!:-) I seriously never use this statement, but while eating I kept thinking... this is \"some bomb ass food!\" Oh and I am not affiliate or sponsored by Tom Yum, it's just that good."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst PHO I've ever had and I am a PHO lover. I have tried MANY PHO'S and this place does not take pride in there cooking. It is very clear, customer service also not so great when I called in upset about my order. Also WHO doesn't put fresh veggies in there PHO or has extremely greasy broth for this dish. Honestly, not worth the money"}
{"text":"Their basil chicken is awesome. Also try the triangle wontons! Service is great, they gave me a free bowl of soup last time I went in."}
{"text":"Service was great. But the pad thai I threw out after only two bites. It just wasn't good. I also tried the chicken satay which seem very stringing and dry and tough like it had been cooked in advance and then finished on the grill. Even the cucumber salad that came with the satay was just tiny little particles of cucumber floating in sweet and sour sauce. It really wasn't cucumber salad. I would never go back again."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try when our regular Thai place was closed. What's the deal with Thai places being closed on Monday, anyone?  My SO and I were pretty hungry, so we started with a pot of the Tom Kha Kai coconut soup with shrimp. The soup was a perfectly balanced blend of sweet and hot with the fresh cilantro adding a nice touch to the flavor profile. 5/5 The orange chicken was perfectly crispy, tender and not too oily, which is a tough feat, but the orange sauce was thin, lacked flavor and only covered about half of the chicken. 3/5 The yellow curry was tasty. The flavor was consistent and well flavored, but the chicken was in the gristly side and small in portion. They also charged an extra $1 for the chicken, which is usually not an upgrade in most Thai places. 2/5   All in all, great soup. Good selections, a bit stingy on the sauces and proteins."}
{"text":"Bad Customer Service. Ordered take out twice and both times they messed up 4 of my meals!!!! When you call to tell them they just don't care. They expect you to pay for what you did not order.. then they offer a discount on the next time you dine with them... AS IF i would eat here again after messing up all my meals on two different occasions.  RUDE and bad customer service, they just lost good customers. Now I will tell all my friends and family NOT to eat here again.  Try Kura Thai, might be better!"}
{"text":"Sure happy to find this place near us. The red curry was amazing. Next time I'm going to take it up a notch. Ordered medium and could have had a little more heat. Also ordered Royal Shrimp and the shrimp were large and plentiful not to mention delicious. Can't wait to come back and try something new."}
{"text":"Quick delivery (30min) but they are not good at listening/following requests. I wanted my food spicy with extra Thai chilis on the side but food came mild with no spicy. Disappointed. Food is mediocre, but I only got egg rolls and pad woo sen."}
{"text":"Rarely a bad experience at this place. They have great Thai food. I love coming here because they are consistent in their quality. I can always rely on the food being well prepared, delicious, and ready on time."}
{"text":"It's hard when you're in Phoenix and you don't have a lot of great Thai or Chinese places to choose from. I ordered the eggrolls, Mongolian beef, and peanut chicken. DELICIOUS. Usually when I order delivery, I have to meet the person outside of my condo because they have a hard time finding my unit. Not with Tom Yum. The delivery person was not only speedy, but great with service as well. The portion sizes were huge!!! Super pleased with this restaurant and I will be back."}
{"text":"Still love this place and order delivery around once per week - favorite Thai place in the valley. Always great taste and fast delivery, so it makes for a good weekday dinner when we run out of time to cook. Our favorites are the Pad Thai, dumplings/pot stickers, and drunken noodles.  Also you better know what \"Thai Hot\" means before choosing that option on your noodles - it's the real thing, and it'll burn like the hottest of foods - it's great but for the hardcore spice lovers."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, but this wasn't my favorite. I asked for Medium but it's was distinctly mild. Probably wouldn't eat here again"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found this place! I ordered Drunken Noodles and Spicy Fried rice, both level \"hot\". The flat noodles are my favorite! They don't deliver but offered free veggie spring rolls for the inconvenience and they are delicious! I hope people find this place and fall in love. I did not dine in, but it was clean and I was greeted with a smile. Looking forward to my next visit and I'll definitely let my friends know about this little gem."}
{"text":"Residing in the boonies most of the time makes it hard to find good, close restaurants. Tom Yum north Phoenix is definitely the go to Thai food joint for me. The drunken noodles with the duck is so incredible I'm considering ordering it right now! The Panang curry is also excellent but beware when they say hot they mean HOT! I've only ever got food to go so I can't comment on the service but I would definitely stop in and check it out if you're looking for a good Thai joint!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, quality food, not very busy yet. They seem new to the neighborhood or at least I'd not seen them until recently. Today was my second visit and I enjoyed the Drunken Noodles. I asked for crispy tofu with it and that's exactly what I got - perfect. The larb with chicken was great, overall things could have been spicier but I understand that they try to spice things for the average customer, no problem because they bring a relish dish of four different chili preperations so I easily too the heat up to my liking. My first visit was for Massuman Chicken and Papaya salad....yeah they have brown rice too! I'll return."}
{"text":"I always went to one in Surprise.  I'm so glad they added this location. I love there drunken noddle. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was great. Have ordered this twice already.  Other dishes I have tried are not AS great as the pad Thai."}
{"text":"I have to change my rating to three stars because I've ordered here several times now. The food is mediocre at best. I just received a delivery of panang and pad se ew and the panang was watered down, no flavor and the beef was dry. The pad se ew was ok. I'm not sure if I will continue ordering here again, but at least I've given them enough chances to make me a fan and they have failed."}
{"text":"The best service I have ever had in a long time, greet you at the door as you come in, never needed to ask to refill my drink or needed to ask when my food is going to come out it was there when they told me when it will , Very nice place inside and out side. Very quiet inside, food is very authentic, very large portions very very good food, and I've never had Thai food before until now it's only place I will ever go back to thank you very much it was very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Real Thai food from a straight up Thai lady.  You can't go wrong.  I come in here for lunch on Tuesdays.  The curries are all really good.  The Pad Thai is really good too.  I have even had the orange chicken it's all good!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food!  I like to grab their take-out....don't be fooled by the odd mannequin in the window, she's a strange decoy to freak you out.  The food is actually pretty good.  Careful of the spice, this place is no-joke!"}
{"text":"They make the BEST Tom Kha soup in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  Had panang chicken.  Was funny and not much chicken.  Tasted pretty good. Would not return for panang."}
{"text":"Excellent. First time here. Heard the food was very good and it was better than good. Excellent. Just opened about 2 months ago. A must try if you like great Thai food. Chef owner extremely sweet and talented.  Exciting menu."}
{"text":"My family and I had ordered take out. Warning, don't use the online system the prices are higher. If doing take out just call them it's cheaper.   That being said, the food was phenomenal. The penang curry was flavorful. One of the  best penang curries I ever had.   We had a pork dish and two dishes with vegetarian chicken substitute. I'm a meat eater my spouse is not and I even enjoyed the fake meat. It was great!  The food was great the owners were very nice. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad at all. If I lived close by and craved Thai food I'd come here. Unfortunately for them I live by Sala Thai which is far superior, so I don't think I'd come back only on the basis that I live near a closer and better place. Sorry... I hope the neighborhood close by keeps them in business cause they are decent."}
{"text":"Yum! The medium spice is a little more like hot but wonderful. I ordered take out and I am defiantly going to be going back. If the delivery driver is even half as nice as the wait staff, I am in!"}
{"text":"I typically eat at their downtown restaurant for lunch, but this location opened near home and I had to grab some take out tonight and gave it a try.   This place is great. The food is great and prepared better than the downtown location. The downtown place is so busy when I'm there. This place is nice quiet. The wait staff can attend to you. It's very nice and mellow.    I got the pad see we (broccoli noodles) and the hubs got yellow curry. Both were amazing. I'm fighting myself to save the leftover noodles for breakfast. I don't know if they'll make it! The Thai ice tea wasn't even super sweet, which is a nice change. Plenty sweet but didn't make your teeth hurt!  If you want to try, I suggest the broccoli noodles, pad thai, any of the curries, and the spicy eggplant. The fried rice is also great. The sweet potato ap will have you fighting your companions over. So good!"}
{"text":"Ordered medium spiced bamboo vegetables it was so spicy I couldn't eat it. My bf ordered pepper steak medium spicy. His had no spiciness and not much flavor and just a big whole piece of steak and barley any onions and peppers. They charge outrageous prices for tiny portions and this time around it didn't even taste good.  We have ordered before and at least the food was good. Apparently an off day and a waste of money for me today."}
{"text":"Ordered a soup and entree for dinner on the Yelp app for delivery.  Received call from Yelp customer service about 30 minutes after placing my order, advising me the restaurant could not deliver the food because they had no driver.  Since I had already paid for my food, I had to drive to the restaurant and pick up my order.  The owner and at least two other employees were working. The owner was sitting at the counter on his computer.  Apparently surfing the web is more important than satisfactory service to a customer.   Don't say you deliver food when you don't, or don't want too.  The food was good, however there are other Thai food options that seem to understand the concept of customer service."}
{"text":"The location in downtown Phoenix is great, I go there often when I'm in the area. Today I walked into this north Phoenix location and I was the only one inside, yet it took 5 minutes to be seated as there was no staff to be seen. The woman walked in on the phone and was the phone the whole time I was there, even while taking my order, proceeding to talk to them as I'm ordering. Silverware is dirty, but the food is good. They should just invest their time and money into one location if they can't keep the service consistent."}
{"text":"As another reviewer noted, took 2 hours to prepare my food and deliver with yelp eat 24. I expected it to take a while, based on other reviews. I did not expect for it to taste bland and awful. I ordered green curry with veggies and tofu- Thai hot. Horrible. Wasn't the least bit spicy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Tiger's Cry Salad.... absolutely awesome!  Also the spring rolls are fresh and yummy. I've ordered here a couple times and that salad ...my new go to for lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Didnt pick up the phone for 15mins. Then went there to order, took 10mins to take order. After that have to wait for 35mins to get my food. And all that for a dinner quantity equal to lunch quantity. Better to avoid this spot and head to krua thai."}
{"text":"Loved the food, friendly helpful service and excellent timing on the delivery! I definitely will order again."}
{"text":"I have my only \"go to\" Thai meal, which is pad Thai...I saw the \"angel wings\" on this menu and decided I'd give them a try...I did however still order my \"go to\" ...I ordered from yelp and picked it up, upon arrival, the guy wasn't very friendly and when I asked for chili sauce, he quizzed me on which kind I wanted instead of giving me both when I couldn't decide...he ended up giving me one measly little container of chili paste...Food was good, Thai tea is to die for but their customer service could use some work"}
{"text":"I ate there twice during the course of the Spring 2017 MRS meeting. It is a nice place that is near a lightrail station and the Phoenix convention center. The first time I ordered a bow of Tom Yum soup with mixed seafood. The taste is a little bit lighter than I expected. The second time I ordered the drunken fried rice as I was attracted by the name. This time the rice's flavor was perfect but the amount is small considering its price. Averagely, one need to spend $15 for a meal."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much based off low star reviews, but I really wanted food and was too lazy to go out. Hahaha. So i settled on Tom Yum Thai because they only have a $3 delivery fee and no minimum.  I ordered the yellow curry, coconut soup, pad Thai double Thai hot and crab rangoons. Food arrived way before the expected delivery time and HOT! The pad Thai was very spicy and the curry and coconut soup were very tasty. I was not a huge fan of the crab rangoons or the sauce they came with. Also, the coconut soup would have been perfect had it not contained hard bamboo shoot pieces. It was a decent meal for delivery and it arrived quick and HOT. Would order again."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai in a strip mall .. I ordered the green curry.. Medium heat with chicken and brown rice.. Perfect lunch size serving .. You're full but don't need a nap immediately after lunch .. Medium heat was good .. Very tasty!!   Lots of lunch specials.. With directions on how to order printed on the menu.. Yes!!   Server was a young guy  (Back to the Future t-shirt.. ) handled the lunch crowd, drink refills and the various pick up orders .. Service was quick and efficient!!   Everything that came out of the kitchen smelled delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Completely ignored my special instructions on grubhub to sub out potatoes for eggplant. :-( Other than spending $20 on a dish I can't eat half of... it's pretty good."}
{"text":"chow mein i ordered is beyond delicious, will be ordering more here (: shout out to the delivery driver; she's really nice (:"}
{"text":"Good food, but service staff doesn't really give good service. Maybe if I am white?  Got to work tonight only to realize that they didn't give me right change. My order was 25 dollars and a few cents and gave them 40 bucks. Just realized they only gave me 5.51 in change. Really? I thought Asians know how to count money? This is the 2nd time they did that. Need to train people here how to count $$$."}
{"text":"Ordered via Yelp app one night after work. It notified me that it would be a 45-60 minute wait. I was disappointed but figured that it was an overestimation. I got to the restaurant in 15 min and my food was done 5 min after. So first brownie point was the fact that the take out was prompt. I paid for everything online so check out was really easy.   Moving onto the food...we ordered our classics... pad see ew and yellow curry. We were very satisfied with the authenticity. We even had some left over after we filled out bellies!   Can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"When a company has 4 stars and I can order delivery through Yelp, I don't hesitate.  I should have.  It took over 2 hours to receive my order... :(.  It was a special night ... We were treating family.  After one hour I called the restaurant and was told he had just left with our order.  Thirty minutes later, still no food.  Called again and was informed he had 3 orders to deliver.  I was assured he had special bags and my food would be warm.  Another 30 (total time over 2 hours) he arrives!  I politely ask if my calamari will be soggy he replies smiling \"yes, yes\" clearly he has no idea what I said.  Sure enough the food is cold, soggy, and gross.  Not enjoyable at all!!!  $100 wasted.  I'll never order from here again.    We got, calamari, pot stickers, sweet sour chicken(not bad... If it was hot), duck curry ( not good ), and pad Thai (I've had much better).  Ok the bright side, kids were so starving they ate the soggy calamari!"}
{"text":"Probably my third favorite Thai place in the valley. Everything is always super tasty and fresh. I love the green curry, pad se yew and chow mein!"}
{"text":"First time here and love it! Our other Thai place was closed on Monday so we just happened to fall upon this place. Great service, small clean cute place, wonderful food. Owners out greeting customers.  Very attentive. Tons of food. We had a little of everything...crab puffs melted in your mouth. Coconut soup was perfect. We tried the tiger's cry salad...refreshing. My young boys fell in love with the orange chicken. Tastes like honey and donuts. Just like fry bread! I had the ginger fantasy. Hubby had the red curry. Great flavored food with enough spice. Mild is nothing, medium is just perfect for us. We like things spicy. We will definitely come back. Nice jewel in a hidden pocket."}
{"text":"Updated review for lunch visit. Menu prices for chicken lunch specials went from $6.50 to $9, far more than any other lunch special in the area.  Portions did not increase, so value has declined by a third.  Lunch now includes an orange slice, wow!  :(   Broccoli Noodle was good but very oily. Service was challenged to keep up with only 3 tables occupied.    Sorry, Tom Yum, but I will drive a few miles further for the lunch special at Thai House which really is a special."}
{"text":"There is a note on this page \"from the owners\" that states that new owners \"recently\" took over this location.  It is unfortunate that this site doesn't delete all reviews written when the old owners ran it because any restaurant is 100% about where the owners buy their food, how they cook it, how they treat their customers and how much they charge, NOT the name on the building.  I can only assume most of the \"positive \" reviews were written about the \"old\" owners' place and not what the \"new\" owners did after they took over.  Whatever the culture I believe there is no such thing as \"the best\" of any food.  Whether burgers or pizza, Mexican or Asian the joy of eating is to experience subtle regional differences and the unique style of the chef.  That said, Thai food does have certain characteristics that define it like a blend (always a blend) of the five flavors of sour, sweet, salty, bitter, and spicy. Unfortunately Tom Yum's interpretation of blend ended up being more like bland and that is the one word I would use to describe their style of food preparation.  We shared two dishes. First the soup, a hot and sour broth with pieces of chicken.  Overall it wasn't bad. The reddish broth had a nice kick to it and the fact that they used white meat chicken was a plus. However the chicken pieces tasted like they were from a can ... devoid of all flavor. The biggest negative about the soup however was that it was $10 for a very small container, a fraction of the size our favorite local Chinese restaurant serves for half the price.  Tom Yum's soup just isn't worth ten bucks.  Our other dish was Ginger Fantasy which is described as \"Mixed chicken, pork, beef and shrimp sauteed with ginger, onion, carrot, mushrooms, and bell peppers in a garlic ginger sauce\".  Being brutally honest it was as bland as something from a steamer tray at Panda Express. The \"fantasy\" must be that you are supposed to imagine the non-existent flavors.  It comes with adequate amounts of rice and a \"brick\" of noodles but the serving size of the menu item itself was embarrassingly tiny and it cost $15!  Any good restaurant review is a blend itself of several important factors ... food quality, value, service, ambience, etc.  On the first two Tom Yum scores very poorly, their food is bland, overpriced and portions are much too small. As far as service and ambience, we were there during dinner time on a Friday night and there were diners at only one table, otherwise the place was dead. As was the single employee who looked like he wished he was somewhere else, anywhere else but there - he made me feel completely unwelcome. The restaurant itself is located in a seedy (and almost scary) strip mall next to a smelly cowboy bar with \"characters\" hanging around everywhere in the parking lot, definitely not a family friendly environment after dark.  I sense maybe the new owners may be franchise entrepreneurs looking for expansion opportunities but that's just a guess based on their over-the-top over-promising (and expensive looking) website that seems to have no correlation to the actual restaurant.  They rely on a grossly inaccurate automated Grubhub/Yelp ordering system that advised us that it would take 40 minutes to prepare our take-out meal. Being our first time there we arrived very early only to find our bag of food already sitting on the counter waiting for us. Apparently the automated system is not synchronized in any way to actual restaurant conditions.  I struggled to find a reason to give them as high as 3-stars for \"average\" but I couldn't do that and still keep my review honest. What absolutely kills them is price and the nail that seals it is that it is the worst Thai food I've ever had.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!!! The yellow curry is Tom YUM!!!  I go here at least once a week and thoroughly enjoy it every time. My only complaint is the curry portion is pretty small for the price."}
{"text":"Gross!! Delivery took forever, didn't state lunch special aren't valid on weekends so took even longer sorting out that mess. Way OVERPRICED! Worst crab Rangoon of my life,  chicken came cursed like ground beef or something, if it Wasn't for brown rice is still be dying of hunger two hours after ordering. Never again no thank u! If you want good Thai go to Thai basil!!"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive service. First time here after seeing this place many times. Glad we stopped in for lunch. Drunken noodles and pad thai were both delicious.  Lunch specials come with egg roll and soup and choice of protein. Lots of vegetarian options. This is a new favorite spot for lunch. Can't wait to come back to taste the different curries."}
{"text":"Although the food is good, the service and kitchen organization is atrocious. We had a party of four for lunch and none of our food came out at the same time even though we ordered all at once. It took 20 minutes or better from the time the first meal arrived to the fourth. This is after waiting for 30 minutes or more for our food to even come. The appetizers came midway through meals being delivered and were ice cold.  We watched several people leave after waiting a long time for a server to come take their order. One person placed an order and left after 45 minutes of not receiving it. The poor woman had to go back to work hungry because she never got her lunch. It appeared not one server had an assigned section, all wait staff attended all tables in the dining area.  No wonder the dining area was pure chaos. I do not recommend to go during a lunch rush."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The staff, including the owner Brock were super welcoming and friendly. The satay appetizer, panang curry were out of this world. Highly recommend and will definitely be back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and great food. Got my order wrong (stuff happens) called to get it corrected and they were super apologetic and cool about it. They let me keep the mistaken order and made me a fresh one."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here a couple of nights ago. The delivery fee ($3) is more than reasonable, and our food was delivered quickly - about 30 minutes ahead of the delivery window estimated by yelp!   We got the pad Thai \"hot\" and it was very hot but yummy - any hotter and it wouldn't have been edible. The red curry and larb were good, although we were a little disappointed that the larb didn't come with lettuce. We ordered brown rice and ended up with white rice instead - not a deal breaker but something to note.   All in all, will probably order again for the convenience and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Quick service, the waiter was nice, and the food was exactly what we were looking for. Had the Red Curry with Chicken and Orange Chicken, both were great portions and hit the spot."}
{"text":"So excited to have a good Thai restaurant close to home. Was in and out in 45 minutes and the food was so delicious. Summer Rolls to start were tasty and the Chicken Pad Thai was amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Orange chicken was sub par and the pd Thai was tasteless. We also had the sweet potato app. It was undercooked an underwhelming. Might have just ordered the wrong thing, but wife is a pad Thai enthusiast, so doubt we make it back"}
{"text":"Ordered the Drunken Fried Rice & Spring Rolls via EatStreet (use Carmc2 for a discount) and it's amazing! My food is still hot and fresh and flavorful. The portions are healthy for the price. They have a lot of vegetarian options which I appreciate right now."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy! Very yummy authentic food! I got the chicken pad Thai, tiger salad, and coconut tom Kai soup and SAP SAP SAPP LAI! (Very very very good!) Just don't go there if you're in a hurry to dine and go! They definitely operate on \"Thai-time\" haha but very good authentic Thai food! Friendly service makes it just that much better too! =] #TheyMadeTheAncestorsProud"}
{"text":"Bad experience trying to order delivery for lunch. I was very excited to see the option of ordering through yelp for lunch delivery. I knew I had a very busy day and could not leave the office. I placed the order, payment was processed. However, about 45 minutes later, 15 minutes before I was expecting the delivery, I received a notification that the restaurant was \"unable to deliver\". Now it is too late to order anything else in the area for delivery during my lunch time. I will not have any food for lunch. I definitely will not be trying again with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten the Pad Thai, but it's always delicious and never fails to delight. It's extremely difficult to order over the phone, so I recommend using the Eat Street app if available."}
{"text":"We ordered the eggplant -mild, added shrimp, calamari and potstickers.  The eggplant was inedible - way too spicy. The calamari was so big and thick it looked like onion rings. That was the opposite of what I was expecting. They were tough and gross.   The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1, the potstickers were decent. Although they looked just like the ones from Costco, and they were over cooked.  Very doubtful we will order from there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here several times and have never been disappointed! The food is always fabulous and they even have a delivery option!! Staff is super friendly and more than happy to help you make a decision if your not sure what to get!"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. I ordered drunken noodles with no meat and got a bunch of veggies with barely any noodles. I was really wanting noodles. There goes $11.00."}
{"text":"I am a fan from the downtown location and now that this north Phoenix location is open I'm a fan of this one too!!!! the same great lunch special is offered the food is prepared very quickly and they deliver! great curry great Tom yum soup great drunken noodles great house fried rice and great Thai teas! the people are nice and do their best to try and get to know the customer in their new area! give them a try and u won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was good, but I think I ordered the wrong thing. The Soups looked great, but I went with Pad Thai with Thai spice level. I like spicy food, but this was really hot. I'll try them again for one of the soups"}
{"text":"I work nearby and forgot my lunch at home.  A quick search here on Yelp and I was able to peruse the menu, order online, and pick up in minutes.  The lunch special panang chicken was very good.  In fact, my coworkers may have spotted me licking the bowl!  I intended to eat half and save half for dinner, but that somehow didn't happen. Someone on Yelp mentioned that you pay more with the online ordering service, but that was not the case for my lunch special.  It was $8 online and $8 on the menu I picked up there.  I actually found a savings code for the online service and saved 15%, so it was cheaper to order online.  This restaurant is in a strip mall, but I found it to be pleasant inside.  Nothing fancy and not big, but  clean and comfortable.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. My family and I eat here on occasion and its worth the trip from east valley."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and I love that the food is always on point! Service is fast, food portions are large and great price point! Absolutely recommend this place for Thai food"}
