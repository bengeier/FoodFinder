{"text":"As a vegan, I was so happy that whenever I've ordered, they've accommodated me. Recently they've added vegan fried rice to their menu which is to die for! Wish I lived closer, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised to see the lower review for this place (though it seems like it's partly from some very determined person who has gone to every review site possible to post the same bitter review over a groupon dispute?)

I've been getting takeout sushi here pretty much since I've moved to the area a couple years ago. I've always liked the sushi here just fine! It seems a bit pricey until you see the portions they give -- it's never one sad little scrap of fish plopped onto the rice, what they serve is generous and my one piece of advice would be not to over order! Just one of the special rolls is a meal in and of itself. Everything is fresh and delicious, my only complaint would be they cut the rolls into pieces that are way too big to actually fit in your mouth. You have to do it in two bites, which isn't necessarily easy when it comes to maki rolls. 

I've eaten in-restaurant a couple times now including just last night. We stuck to the \"known\" stuff like pad thai and dumplings just because I wasn't sure how adventurous my company was food wise, and it was all great! You get huge portions for the cost. Everything is fresh and delicious -- we got the deep fried version of the dumplings and they were light and crispy, and it was clear it was all made fresh in-house unlike with most restaurants where you order the gyouza.  

The service can be a bit slow (I believe it's a family-run place, but don't quote me on that) but I don't see a huge issue with that, it's not a fast food joint. The food always comes out very quick and piping hot once you've ordered, and the staff were pleasant and happy to meet any requests we had. We even just hung out chatting for a while after we'd paid the bill -- a pair across from us were doing the same -- and the staff didn't seem to mind at all, even kept coming by to top up our water and check on us. 

The menu is a sort of odd mix of Thai, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese dishes, so you're not necessarily going to get the ultimate authentic \"x\" experience per se -- but it definitely has that home cooked meal feel to it, which I don't often get from restaurants serving these types of dishes. So I'm gonna go ahead and give this one five stars, I like this little restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I've been to gohyang many times and I must say this is by far my favourite restaurant in the area. They have recently renovated and added some delicious new item to their menu. Their pad Thai is to die for and the chilli chicken is just devine. Their sushi menu is extensive and they serve really fresh fish. I also like the new wine menu, which has a lot of great wines that pair really well with their food. The staff is very friendly and service has always been excellent. I have also ordered delivery a few times and must say they are always on time and the food was always great. A must try is their secret dipping sauce for calamari and spring rolls. Most delicious sauce I have ever tasted. I always ask for extra to go. Thank you gohyang and look forward to visit again."}
{"text":"Negative infinity. I wrote a previous raving review about this place when it was also known as Hometown Restaurant. At that time, it was also searchable and you can buy their food online at just-eat.ca.  The owners even thanked me for my review.

Well, never again will I come here.  Maybe they changed management.  I saw a deal on Groupon for sixty dollars. The heading was $60 for four people. The actual terms state: reservation required, weekdays, dinner only.

So I attempted to make a reservation for tonight and advised that it will be two people I don't know how many people actually.  She advised me \"how can I serve you the Groupon says for four people\".  I advised that I paid the exact same and have a credit of 60 does it matter if I want to eat all of that? Or five people want to eat all of that? It is not a set menu. 

She told me to call Groupon to cancel it.

Wow!! I know if you buy a Groupon, more often than not, the establishment's service sucks, but I've been here many times before and they even replied to my review nicely, so I thought I would get good service.  So I took that chance.

I will not and cannot blame Groupon I blame the establishment for their horrible treatment of customers.  That's probably why they use Groupon now, they slacked and are crap. I take back my previous raving review.

To insist on four people exactly means they want to seem as if people go there and they are busy, imo.  I used to go here so much but for takeout.  Well forget you gohyang. Never again will I visit your establishment!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places ever. Never had a bad experience and staff is always really nice. Dine in or take out its always good quality"}
{"text":"Meh.

As seems to be increasingly prevalent with asian restaurants, most of the food i ordered for a family of four was noodle or rice with very little meat or vegetables. 

Food was well spiced and tasty so good marks there but 95% noodle or rice almost bereft of meat."}
{"text":"After getting off the highway and deciding to just take Dundas Street W into town we randomly stumbled across Gohyang Restaurant yesterday and decided it was time to check this place out. Since it was only around 11AM when we walked in the place was completely empty and the server was quick to take our orders and the back was lightening fast at making the food. I ordered the \"Chicken Balls\" which can only be described as giant pieces of sweet and sour chicken that blew me away. For the price that was paid I was given a large portion and I couldn't of been happier with coming here. Sometimes getting off at a random spot and wandering into a random establishment can provide some of the best food!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I should have listened to the yelp reviews instead of the other sources. The sushi is quite a joke (sorry) so, so disappointed. Only reason I chose this place was they sold takoyaki which was decent. Probably won't order from here (sorry)."}
{"text":"I have eaten here so many times I have lost count.  From home delivery to sitting down in their restaurant I have yet to be disappointed.  They have AMAZING fried rice and exceptional sushi.  The space is clean and nicely decorated.  The family that owns it are extremely friendly.  Love this place and would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"New owners and did a little reno to make it more of a clean brighter look.

The sign noted it was a Japanese, Korean and China restaurant.
When we were seated... we were handed the Japanese/ China menu.
We came for Korean... the previously great portion and great tasking black bean noodles.
When we were abbout to leave and stated we were specifically here for korean... there was another menu which wss not presented... as the waiter thought we wouldnt understand it.
Nonetheless, we were happy to see our dish was available.
The portion was larger than previous owners and it tasted great!
Price was bang on too!
Very happy with the dish!

Their tempura app was a bit pricey bit the veggie pieces were big so we couldnt complain.
It was ok tasting.

Small dining area... but we had no issues getting seated.

Their main menu was very hard to read... with pages like light pink background off white fonts... they need to make their menu more legible.  Prices for sushi items very a bit on the higher side too.

Owners of this place are Chinese."}
{"text":"Excellent quality of food! Some food we ordered came almost instantly while others took some time to come. The decor is very cozy and the bathroom is very clean. 

Only issue I had is that the sushi roll I ordered were thick pieces (at least 1-inch in thickness, 2.5 inch in diameter), that they were difficult to eat."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for sushi so I stopped here for lunch. We were there very early-around 11:30-and the place was empty. It's very small and very clean. 
The menu had a good amount of options to choose from. They had entrees, rice dishes and sushi rolls. I wasn't starving so I ordered just one specialty roll. I went with the salmon lovers role. My boyfriend had ordered a sweet and sour chicken dish. He got his meal about 10 minutes before mine. I thought that was a bit odd-but no big deal. My sushi was alright, the flavour was great, the pieces themselves were HUGE! There was no way to put one whole roll in your mouth at once. It was very filling. My boyfriend's dish was amazing!! 
Overall, I'm satisfied with my visit here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service too!  I went with a Groupon and ordered additional items.

I had a spider roll, with soft shell crab tempura, crab meat and avocado, tr?s yummy!  The restaurant also serves Dim Sum, all hand made by their supplier.  Cooked to order.  I had 4 siu meiI for $5.50, fantastic!!

Then I ordered the canton chow mein, with lots of shrimp, beef, chicken and calamari, over crispy chow mein noodles....yum yum!

Very nice experience, I'll definitely be returning!"}
