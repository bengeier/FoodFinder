{"text":"Went to this place to have drinks, the lady was snickering with her other co-worker in front of me, it was akward. Very rude, & couldn't care less to check up on us to see if we wanted anything. Terrible, would not recommend this place to anyone. Island grove has cheaper beers & no body will laugh at you & make you feel stupid."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant for its food quality and taste. I was completely impressed by the lunch buffet and how vast the selection and tasty the dishes. In spite of sour yogurt which may either have been as a result of a Punjabi recipe or poor food handling. Despite a few mishaps, the dahi bhallas and chaat papri options were so exciting, as were the dual dessert options. I definitely expect to return. Service was good."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to me, as my SO was looking for somewhere that had good Chicken Vindaloo. Even though this restaurant has a buffet, you can also order take out - which is what I did.
I wound up ordering the Chicken Vindaloo which was apparently wonderful, the small bit I tried (I'm not into spicy food!) was very flavourful and wasn't as spicy as I was anticipating. To accompany the meal I got some Channa (also extremely flavourful with a bit of heat to it) and some Naan which was nice and fresh. My SO was so impressed by this place that I came back the next day and got the same meal but instead of vindaloo we got Butter Chicken and it was AWESOME. The amount of chicken you get is great, and it's quality meat - no bones, gristle or questionable bits, just nice meaty chunks of white chicken. Yum yum. 
Prices are decent but a TAD on the higher side - for the meat dishes you definitely get your money worth (the 2 I tried were $9.99 ea).
Both times I've gone it has been pretty empty, but I think that has more to do with the sub-zero temperatures. It's a nice venue with plenty of seating. Maybe one day I'll go in for the buffet. :)"}
