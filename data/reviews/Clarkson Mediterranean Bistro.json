{"text":"Tried the seafood festival dinner, 2 seafood dishes plus dessert for $30. Food and service was excellent. Portion sizes were also generous. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and will definitely be back again.   Each time the food has exceeded expectations, and the service is attentive without being pushy. The place really should be packed most nights but it's never a problem getting a seat.  The last time we were in one member of our party wanted gnocchi but not the way it was described on the menu so they made a dish to order and it was delicious, as were all of our other entrees - two fish dishes and a steak.  With prices that are surprisingly reasonable for such great quality this place deserves to be a neighbourhood favourite."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems in Mississauga. Amazing food, amazing service. I will definitely be back here. I had the stuffed chicken supreme and I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the food was.   Very class, you must see it to believe it.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"We love it here. Never a bad meal. Service is impeccable. Big thanks to Kevin and Andrew who have been amazing since our first visit. Bo the new addition is equally as charming and lovely, Sam runs an amazing kitchen and sees and hears everything. These chaps are like visiting friends!!!"}
{"text":"The rating is for the quality and taste of the food. The service is a bit of a calamity.  They were out of many menu items, including most martinis? There are things they told us about not having, and some things that just came far different from the menu description.  First waiter took only 2 drink orders at a time, despite 8 of us being there. The second and more capable waiter hit 2 of us in the head with plates of other diners. They refused to split bill as we had asked if 1st waiter but not second.  Really amateurish"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! There was also a gentleman playing light music in the other room. They bring you complimentary bruschetta and warm bread. I had the grilled calamari app with olives and capers and the lobster tail seafood linguini. Both were tasty, had nice presentation & very generous portions. My friends and I stayed late chatting until closing and the waiter was always attentive and didn't rush us even though he must have wanted to!"}
{"text":"The service was perfect - and I literally mean perfect. Our waiter constantly checked up on us and refilled our water, and the employees were so kind that it delivered such a great atmosphere to sit in and dine. The food was amazing, I ordered the chicken risotto and it was so fresh, creamy, and perfect in texture. It could not have been any better, this was my first visit here and they really made a great impression and I will definitely be coming back. The only downside is that since I went on Valentine's Day, it took a while for them to deliver our food, but it's totally understanding since it was busy. I recommend this place, just amazing."}
{"text":"Great menu friendly service awesome patio right on Lakeshore. I would recommend it for a couples night out or with kids. The veal Marsala is my favourite"}
{"text":"A delightful surprise. We had wanted to try somewhere in Clarkson but knew nothing of what was available. We found this place through a \"5 top restaurants in Clarkson\" listing in the local paper.  The decor was really nice. Elegant without being intimidating. White tablecloths, beautifully done out place settings. The lighting is low and intimate but not too dark.  The service was excellent, efficient without being pushy.(Unlike many of the \"corporate\" places where one is greeted by a bouncy young person with a fake smile. You know the type.)  While we waited for our orders to arrive, they served us tiny slices of bruschetta along with some delicious slices of warm bread.  I ordered the Soup of the Day which was Roasted Red Pepper and carrot. Delicious. It arrived in a deceptively shallow bowl, which turned out to be bottomless!  My main course was Mushroom Risotto, a dish I have rarely seen on a menu here. Wow, was it ever delicious and really filling.  My husband ordered the Veal Chop. This was huge and done to perfection.  Dessert was Creme Brulee and Coffee  This place will certainly be a fave and we will return. It is SO nice to find a really lovely place to dine in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Mother's day weekend and we were in a group of eight. But for some reason the food was late. Almost two hours late, can't blame them because I did only see one cook in the back and that poor man was probably struggling. The restaurant gave us free bruschetta and glasses of wine for the wait so that helped. I ordered the seafood linguine and it was just so delicious. They had so many mussels and shrimps that I even counted them all in total. The sauce was simple but flavourful. Pretty much devoured it because I was so hungry. Too bad it's so far from where I live because I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is Italian with lots of seafood. The Chef is very good (5 star hotel good) and the service was excellent. We will return!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this restaurant existed and I've lived here for six years! Wish I came sooner..  Came here for Mother's Day for a party of 5 plus baby. I didn't realize how swanky it was until I got in- I was wearing sandals so I felt kind of bad (oops! Lol) but they didn't make me feel uncomfortable because of it. They gladly made space for the baby and put us in front of the window where you can watch the chefs cooking- very cool!   Let me just tell you, the bread is so soft and delicious! We had to order a second one. Also, our food tasted delicious (my brother's steak was melt-on-the-mouth amazing!) and my mom and I loved our fix-priced menu that we ordered from. I got the lobster bisque as an appetizer and the seafood linguine for my main, followed by the creme brûlée for dessert. All of it was just amazing. We also ordered two plates of the calamari appetizer because it was that good! The pieces were cooked to perfection and were big sizes (not small squid pieces like some restaurants serve).  Our main server was a guy named Kevin (super friendly and attentive) and we were also being served by another guy that has a bit of an angry grandpa vibe lol it was kind of funny. Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came for my birthday February 5, my first time with my girls , and had a wonderful time. Oscar is amazing , very busy man but we squeezed a laugh or two with him , we all had fun with him, The portions of food are great for women I guess for the men not so much they kept eating bread so that kind of tells you portions for little bit small for the man."}
{"text":"It has great reviews so while in the neighborhood, we tried some dishes at the bar while waiting for takeaways.  Staff was attentive, dining area clean and well presented, however, the food prep/plateing/taste did not meet my expectations.  It was reminiscent restaurants from the early 80s that had difficulty with controlling their seasonings and/or lack thereof.  If I do try here again, I would steer clear of the octopus since it is very tough and the olives that come with them are overly salty for my palette.  GF pasta option is available, however, for us, it was not prepared for optimal aldente texture and the creamy sauce lacked depth and aroma.  The roasted chicken seemed to have been cooked the day (or many days) before, almost tasteless and warmed up in the microwave.  Perhaps we got these guys on an off night?"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon for $69, you get a 4 course meal for 2 people.   It comes with a cheese platter for two, then apps, entrees and desserts.   I got the beet salad, while the bf got the calamari! He enjoyed both :) I thought my beet salad was missing some acidity or pop.  He had the veal scallopini and it was okay, I had the seafood linguini and my partner ate all the seafood but the sauce and the pasta was cooked perfectly.   The creme brulee's sugar top was delish!!! The tartofu was very pretty and not too sweet or bland!  Ambiance on the patio was great, service was warm and consistent.   Would definitely return for their normal menu!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for 2 for pre-set lunch with choice of apps and mains. Had their calamari salad with mixed green and it was amazing!! I choose tilapia with grilled veggies as my main and that was well done and filling too. Sat outdoor on their small patio as it was a gorgeous day. Wish the place looked out to something more scenic than the Main Street on Lakeshore. Overall a nice cosy experience with good service!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the waiter was grumpy and barely smiled. It was empty except for 2 tables on the patio. The device was still slow considering how dead they were.  The food was ok but not what I would expect given the price.  The calamari salad was good. The Caesar was standard.  The veal with gravy and goat cheese was ok and the char was low on flavor.  We ended with dessert - the Creme brûlée was too sweet."}
{"text":"Visiting Mississauga from the U.S. Looking to book a place for family birthday. Made a reservation using their online booking system three weeks prior only to be called a week prior saying they were closed for a private function. Sounds like they had a better offer financially this night. While I appreciated the call leaves little time to get a table at one of the finer restaurants in the area. Doubt we'll try again."}
{"text":"Disclosure:  Came here for \"Taste of Clarkson\", which is like a Winterlicious...but less crowds and less participating restaurants.  My table was 1 out of 3 parties who were at Clarkson Mediterranean Bistro for lunch, mid-week, so although I had reservations online, I honestly don't think you need them...during the week.  Weekend may be different, especially with the current promotion.  Server was naturally friendly and was there when we needed him.  Attentive, but not overbearing which is how I prefer waitstaff to be.  And not pretentious in the least.  I hate pretentious waitstaff...especially when you're the one who's paying.  Everything on the menu sounded pretty good!  It was $18 for 2-course and $22 for a 3-course lunch.  The restaurant also had $5, yes $5!, cocktail specials from 2:30-5:30pm, during the week.  Otherwise, it was $7.95, still not a bad price!  After we ordered, we were given complimentary bruschetta which was good.  What we ordered:  Seafood Chowder, Calamari Salad, Seafood Linguini, Veal Marsala, Panna Cotta, & Tartufo.  Between my friend's choices and mine, I think I preferred mine (Salad, Pasta, Panna Cotta), but dessert-wise, it was a toss-up.  I found the Chowder and Marsala needed a tad more seasoning, but still very good, and you can taste the quality in the ingredients.   Political aside:  The restaurant is owned by 2 Sri Lankans.  My SL friend spoke to 1 of the owners and he was very down-to-earth.  And as a visible minority, it is nice to see some diversity, not only in the kitchen as chefs, but also as actual restauranteurs.  I'd definitely come back, Taste of Clarkson or not!    Tip:  There is a large parking lot directly behind the restaurant, just to the West.  Plenty of spots!"}
{"text":"After a string of bad luck in 2015 we finally had a good meal and that Med. Bistro is close by is very much an added bonus.   While it was nice that we were offered a plate of bruschetta at no charge it had very little taste. The small portioned Italian vegetable soup was a 3.5.  The veal medallions (4.5) were plated nicely and perfectly complimented with fresh vegetables.  There is no question we'll be back as The Bistro is our favourite choice on the Clarkson Lakeshore road strip."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a quiet dinner with my mum. The service was excellent. We were presented with a complimentary bruschetta sampler to start off with, which was great, as well as garlic bread.  We ordered the warm goat cheese salad and the beet salad to start - both were delicious. We both had pasta dishes for our entrées (I had the gnocchi). The portions are a good size and the pasta is very reasonably priced and delicious.  I was surprised by the quality of this restaurant considering its low-profile location. I will definitely return with friends.  This would also be a good spot to bring a date!"}
{"text":"Extremely good experience!  Beautiful large, yet intimate restaurant.   Great service.  Large menu with plenty to choose from in pastas, risotto, meats.  Great appetizers and desserts too.  I came with a Groupon, which has a special menu.  I was initially concerned About that, cause I've had bad experiences with Groupon-only menus.  But not here!  You start with bruscgetta, so many tomatoes they fall off!  The only thing missing was a drizzle of olive oil and salt!  And a cheese plate.  The calamari salad is spectacular.  Dressing is so flavourful, with has nuts and raisins.  And an abundance of freshly fried calamari!    The Manhattan fish chowder is a tomato base, with mussels, shrimp and a small scallop, and some fish.  Served piping hot in a beautiful bowl.  The Arctic Char with veggies and potato is outstanding.   Beautiful, properly thickened white wine and lemon sauce!  I could have licked the plate!  The veal with goat cheese was also very good.  The creme brûlee is excellent, as is the vanilla-lemon panacotta with fresh strawberry sauce!  I am certain that their regular menu is outstanding too!  Parking in the rear, although I didn't find that out til I went to the rest room!"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant this past Saturday for a lunch. We came with a Groupon for 4. We each had an appetizer and a main course. The food was prepared and served in a five-star quality as showed in the pictures.  The service was also five star, thanks to our server, Kevin.  We will definitely go back again to taste other dishes."}
