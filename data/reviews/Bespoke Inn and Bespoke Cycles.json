{"text":"Small, romantic inn with thoughtful, bespoke touches located within walking distance of downtown Scottsdale. The owner-operators are attentive and thoughtful in their advance preparation for even the smallest details: soft, luxuriant towels, fresh fruit and wonderfully appointed rooms. Their Tuscan-style courtyard hosts an excellent restaurant with a wonderful brunch and cutting-edge cocktails. Will stay here anytime I'd like to be near Phoenix or Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stayed at Bespoke Inn for two nights and loved it! I often stay at B&Bs when I travel and this one is one of the best. From the moment I talked to Kate on the phone, I felt this was a special place and it did not disappoint. Charming room with a private patio and luxurious bath, wonderful courtyard and infinity pool and then there is the little restaurant, Virtu. You will feel like you are in Italy the moment you arrive and you are only a few blocks to Old Scottsdale with great charm and art galleries."}

{"text":"We loved spending our anniversary at Bespoke! They were so nice to upgrade our room for our anniversary, we stayed in the Giuseppe & Lotte Suite. The room was great with cute details and a nice little patio. We had both dinner and brunch at Virtú, the on site restaurant, and both meals were wonderful. It is definitely worth spending the 10$ for brunch vouchers, because what we ate definitely exceeded what we spent on the vouchers and it was all delicious! Brunch highlights were the pork ragu over polenta, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. All of dinner was good, but I really enjoyed the asparagus app and you can never go wrong with fresh burrata! We will definitely be back to Bespoke and Virtú."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic stay! I wouldn't consider myself a boutique hotel kind of guy, but this place is stellar. Our room was clean, well put together and VERY comfortable. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the area. Vitru shares the courtyard and is a must as well.  We will be staying here again."}
{"text":"I work for a wholesale fashion company, and one of my co-workers mentioned how cute this place would be for a photo shoot. I contacted Kate about having a photoshoot there and she was more than helpful getting the location set up.  This place is seriously too cute for words. You can tell that the owners put their heart into every single detail. They have bikes to bike around old town, an on site restaurant,  and an amazing infinity pool right outside the signature flat. Everything from the inside to the fireplace and garden area was just amazing. My team and I kept saying how we needed to stay there ourselves!   All in all the pictures came out great and I was so happy to have our shoot at this location. Awesome awesome job!"}
