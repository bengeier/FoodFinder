{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful. The Internet is throttled to ridiculous slow speeds to the point it's almost unusable. However, if your willing to pay $4.95 a day you can get acceptable internet speeds. No continental breakfast. The in-house restaurant and bar (The Bistro) is expensive and slow (it does not open until 7:00 am on weekends). The bartender is the cook. Your better off walking across the street to Applebee's. The pool was nice but the Hot tub was low on water at the time. My family and I stayed three nights and overall I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I am leaving this review entirely because of the morning staff. The rooms and exercise facilities are slightly dated, but livable. I am platinum member and have been for years. And I have never visited a Marriott property with such an unengaged staff. They could not be bothered to get up from sitting in the lounge on their phones to open the cafe on time or make coffee available. Jay"}
{"text":"Very soft bed.... We couldn't sleep because the air conditioner was so noisy. When it would cycle on it was like a B-29 with 3 failing engines coming in for a crash landing."}
{"text":"Right off the interstate, so there are a lot of things right around it.  Decent room.  Hotel has a bar and a bunch of nice places in the lobby to lounge."}
{"text":"Stayed here for an out of town wedding and we were one of several family's that booked rooms together.  As a packaged deal, we were all suppose to get rooms near each other however in the end, some were on the third floor and others on the second.   After speaking with the front desk, they did offer to move all of us onto the third floor.    We ended up not moving since everyone was already settled in and come to find out, the ice machine on the third floor was down.  Our room was OK,  more cramped than I was hoping.  It was very hot and stuffy so we had to kick the AC for sometime before it started feeling better.   The room could have been cleaner.  There was some vitamin pills on the window sill and under the desk chain.   There was a few used toothpicks on the floor as well.  The TV remote was very non-responsive, had to really aim and press each button a few times.  Everything else seemed fine with the room.  They had plenty of towels and having a  fridge, microwave and coffee pot is nice.  The elevator seemed really slow and ready to call it quits any moment.  When there was other people waiting to use it too, things would get way crowded and very slow.  The decor in the hallways is a outdated orange color.  Carpet needs replacement as well.  The pool seemed nice and clean.  I did not use it but saw several others doing so.  They do have a few conference rooms and a spacious front lounge available to use for large crowds.  It worked out great considering how small the hotel rooms are and in surpressing the noise level of crowds.  Upon check out, I could not find a luggage cart anywhere.   Come to find out, they have only two for the whole place.   When I went to check out and hand over my key card, nobody was at the front desk.   I walked up and down the hallways looking for anyone that worked there.  It was soon long that I noticed strangers coming in and grabbing Gatorade's from the front desk.   Your suppose to pay for them but everyone was MIA.  Eventually someone came to work and I was able to complete my checkout.  All in all it was OK but a bit below average.  For the fee they charge you should have working ice machines, cleaner rooms, more luggage carts and better staff attention."}
{"text":"This is a very serviceable Courtyard for me. Clean, convenient to major roads in the area and easy and quick for my drive to the office. This location is right off interstate 90 in Willoughby Ohio. I stay here often when I visit my Cleveland office, which is pretty often.  I can pick up a complementary local Cleveland Paper or a USA today in the lobby. Also in the lobby is a neat little market with beverages, sandwiches, chips, candy and other things you might want when you get the munchies and you don't have to leave the building. Across the street is a Texas Roadhouse, Eat&Park, and Cracker Barrel all of which you can walk to without getting in your car. Up the street is a Bob Evans. Also within a two minute walk there is a CVS pharmacy where you can secure most anything you could want. The staff here has been very friendly and helpful to all my needs. In the morning they serve breakfast in their Courtyard Cafe and I usually get my rate to include breakfast. All in all I am very happy with staying here on my business travel."}
{"text":"The hotel was just like every other Marriott Courtyard - nice room, clean, and ..... it was the staff that set this Courtyard apart from other hotels; from a call to the hotel before we arrive, to the on duty staff at our late check in, and then when we checked out of the hotel, we found one attitude  - UNFRIENDLY, CURT, terse,  like we were bothering them by being at the hotel.  We asked for nothing special, our room was totally prepaid, we are Marriott Gold members, and if we got treated this poorly we have to wonder how other guests who might actually ask for something get treated.  The hotel staff here from management on down needs to stay at the Townplace in Ft Wayne - the hotel we stayed at the following our stay in Cleveland.  That staff knew how to treat guests well."}
{"text":"The Courtyard Cleveland Willoughby location is a nice and comfortable Courtyard location. It feels like they've done a bit of work to update it to the more modern Courtyard offerings.  Pros:  - Room was clean and comfortable - Free Wi-Fi - Flat panel HD TV with a lot of HD channels! - AC worked well in the room - kept it nice and cool - Bed was comfortable - Staff was friendly and helpful - Mini fridge in the room  Cons:  - Not enough electrical outlets at the desk in the room (one) - Not enough electrical outlets in the lobby lounge area - AC in the lounge area when we checked in Tuesday evening did not appear to be working well. It was way to warm in the lobby. We wanted to work out there for an hour or so. We checked with the front desk - they turned the AC on but it took a long time to cool down. - The pillows on the bed flattened down to nothing - The free Wi-Fi was way to slow - The breakfast service was terrible. You get in line to order from their menu, pay, and then they make your food and bring it out to you. This setup was terribly under-staffed and slow. Worst breakfast service I've ever seen in a Courtyard. I prefer their Buffet style offerings.  I'd stay here again, but find somewhere outside the hotel to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Here for a YMCA swim meet.  We were unable to get two queen beds but they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a King Suite to give us more room.  May I say the suite is sweet!!!   Room is quite large with separate bedroom, sofa, frig and microwave.  Room is exceptionally clean.  Very nice pool and hot tub.  Purchased a wine from the lobby bar.  A bit pricey but it was convenient."}
{"text":"The Courtyard Inn Marriott in Willoughby was a GREAT hotel to stay at. The lobby, rooms, and everything were SPARKLING CLEAN, and the staff were so friendly and helpful. The beds were so comfortable after a long concert where I had to stand for a straight 3 hours. I fell asleep right away. It's located right in the middle of a bunch of restaurants and stores, too. I would definitely recommend to anyone in traveling in the Cleveland area. And no, I don't work for Marriott."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a few days on business. I booked it because it was the closest hotel to the office I was visiting.   It's pretty much a basic Marriott Courtyard, which is to say clean, reasonably new and fairly efficient. So from that perspective it's a standard Courtyard and I don't think you'll be disappointed.   My issues were more with price.   Upon check-in my coworker wanted a bottle of water, which they gave her and then said they would charge it to her room? Really? Charging for a bottle of water? Whatever.   We came in on a Sunday night and the cost, at our corporate rate, was a fairly reasonable $120/night. But then during the week the price per night went up to $170/night. Then I found out that doesn't include breakfast. Add in $10 for that and you around $180/night. I recommend you have breakfast at the Bob Evans across the street.   So in my opinion (and I travel a fair amount) $170/night without breakfast for a basic Courtyard in a non-descript strip-mall infested suburb of Cleveland seems a bit expensive to me. Maybe it's not I admit I didn't shop around but if I were paying out of my pocket I might do some homework to see if you can't find something decent that might be cheaper. That price did include free internet that worked pretty well in my room.   Overall I wasn't disappointed in the property itself but it just seemed expensive for what it was and where it was."}
{"text":"Check in the was fast and easy.  use the app to speed up checking in and  to check on prices. I have visited this place several times due to work. And every time I've gone here because my service was really good there was a wedding one night while I was there they had numerous complaints from other people including myself the police showed up to take care of the party and all was good.  The services they offer were really good the rooms and pillows were comfortable I enjoyed my stay here the first floor  accommodations were very good. If I do go back to this area I will pick this place once again."}
