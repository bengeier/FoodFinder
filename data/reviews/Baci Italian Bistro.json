{"text":"I love this restaurant.  If you are looking for good Italian food in the East Valley, you must travel to Baci.  Their pasta portions are huge and delicious, the bread they serve before the meal is great as well.  I must reccomend the cannolis, as they are to die for.  I'm not sure why people have said it is expensive, because it's really not.  Maybe they thought they were at Olive Garden and were expecting unlimited salad and pasta, who knows.  But hands down, the best Italian food in the East Valley."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for Italian food. It's the best, and reasonably priced. Friendly staff is a plus."}
{"text":"My friends liked Baci at the old location so we went to the new location to celebrate a birthday. It was packed but the wait wasn't bad. Once we got seated though, it was like we were forgotten. We Ordered the Antipasta Ala Baci and didn't care for it so we left it. After what felt like forever our waitress finally said she would box it up & as she walked away she said she would put our food order in. It was 9pm by then and we told her if she hadn't put in or order to cancel it because we were going to miss our movie. She was a little argumentative & said the owner doesn't want them serving while the appetizer is still on the table & that it would just take 5 minutes and if we wanted she would just box it up. Given it is supposed to be fresh Italian food I was a little concerned what it would taste like if it was only going to be 5 minutes. We got the orange roughy Florentine, the sirloin tips (nightly special) and the spicy meatballs (nightly special). One friend said the spicy meatball was pretty good but the orange roughy was so bad my other friend couldn't eat it and the sirloin tips were almost as bad. When the waitress came back to box them up my friend tried to tell her how bad the food was but she wouldn't even listen and just took the plate away and gave us a bill for $73 (we had a tea and 2 waters).  I don't think I have ever had service or food this bad before and for that much, I would have been more satisfied going to a fast food restaurant and then throwing the rest of the money away. Sweets was right in saying that friends got preference, the owner even took our waitresses attention away from us to say that the next table was from New York so my friend said I'm from New York too but the waitress just walked away. My friends were repeat customers but they will never go back and neither will I."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Excellent food. Homemade sausage is the best. Portions are large.. Staff is friendly.  Price is reasonable for quality and quantity of food.  We eat there at least 2 times per month and have never had a bad meal.  Luncheon deals are especially good."}
{"text":"First time at Baci.  Food was very tasty and overall a good experience. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just moved to Queen Creek and wanted to find a really good local Italian Restaurant. I chose this place because it came highly recommended by others and also the great reviews. It did not disappoint! The food, atmosphere and service are excellent and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a favorite Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"I definitely don't consider this \"Mesa\", but it is my wife and I's \"go-to\" in queen creek for a decent dinner. Its a few steps above Olive Garden and not once has the meal not been enough for another whole meal the next day"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, and the service is usually great, although sometimes the chef can be very slow (and that's why I give it 4, instead of 5 stars).  Yummy!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant twice now with the same outcome.  We will not return.  I don't usually write reviews but I want to make sure people don't go out of there way for this place. The first time we ordered pasta and I asked a server if they made the pasta in house and she said no.  It all comes from Chicago.  The raviolis were suppose to be the only pasta they made in house and they tasted frozen. This past Friday we decided we would try their pizza.  I can honestly say it was the worst pizza I have ever had.  I was so disappointed because I watched the video on looked at the pictures on their website and it was nothing like that.  We ordered a thin crust and it was heavy and semi thick.  I am still confused on what type of flour they use.  It was almost cornmealish.   We are very disappointed because the restaurant is so close to us and we were hoping for quality food.   Rosati's or even Geno's $5.00 pizza is way above the quality and taste of Baci's."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff is very friendly and fun, the food.....were do I start, and the atmosphere is what you make it...fancy or casual. Love this place! My husband and I even made this our anniversary dinner choice this year. Highly reccomend!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Baci for many years,  but the last three visits have been disappointing.  They used to have the best veal parm in the east valley.   Now it is thinner and a bit tough due to over cooking.   Their pizza is still very nice and other dishes are also very nice.  But no more 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Love this place,great food,service, and atmosphere. The owner greets everyone and is wonderful!!! Pizza is awesome and pasta is the best in the area. The portions are always large. I would recommend this place to everyone. Try the tiramasu... YUM!!!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything you order on the menu! The servers are amazing, the food is amazing, even the bussing team is top notch! The portobello basilica and the chicken and shrimp caprecio (spelling?) are my favorites paired with the homemade minestrone! I love the atmosphere and have to admit that this is my favorite Italian restaurant in the area ... And it's right in our small community! Ohhhh... Do not forget dessert! It's worth feeling even more stuffed!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty on the inside but the service and the food was terrible.  I will never go back.  The service was slow and we were pretty much ignored.  The food was sooooo bad.  I dont mind shelling out $20 for a plate of food but it needs to taste good.  This stuff was terrible.  You should try some place else and save your money!"}
{"text":"We went there based on all the great reviews on Yelp.  What a disappointment.  First we arived about 5:45 on a Saturday evening.  There were at least 10 empty tables but they made us sit in the bar for 10 minutes!  I  ordered a glass of cabernet and the bartender never gave me a wine list or asked me what I preferred--just have me the house wine which was mediocre at best.  The bread was very good.  However, I had the Orange Roughy piccata which was swimming in lemon.  The fish was tough and very chewy.  Orange Roughy should be tender and melt in your mouth.  Another guest had the chicken parm and she was happy with it.  My husband had the baked penne which was overcooked.  We won't be returning.  Very disappointed.  Service was good though other than the bartender."}
{"text":"Very delicious authentic Italian food! We loved the caprese salad. Try the lasagna with vodka sauce, best vodka sauce I've ever had. Delicious clam chowder and minestrone soup! You won't be disappointed. Very very good!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent italian dining!  We had the bruscetta, clam chowder, creamy chicken masala, and cod florentine.  Everything was fantastic, the staff and the owner were friendly and fun, and the atmosphere was beautiful.  We had to wait 45 min but it was well worth the wait.  Don't shy away from the line out the door!  Grab a drink at the bar and relax."}
{"text":"Great Italian Food! Nice atmosphere! Great service and food! It is in the middle of no where, but it sure is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Our family of five really enjoyed this restaurant.  This place just has \"it\" - a pleasant and welcoming feel to it.  Wonderfully friendly people as well who went out of their way to find us a table on a busy night when we did not have a reservation and they had no idea who we were.    Of course, that is great but what about the food?  Every one of the family really liked their meal / hard to please everyone! I would describe the food as basic Italian...but very well executed.  Great value wines to partner with our meals.  Go there, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We placed a to go order and the food was excellent. The staff gave us iced tea while we waited and refilled it several times without us asking. They were extremely friendly and attentive to us. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've had! I've had various things on the menu and never had any disappointments. The service has always been great as well. They go above and beyond to make your dinning experience worth every penny. This is my go to place for Italian food!!!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Friday for dinner and drinks with friends.  We arrived early and headed to the bar area to wait for our friends and a table.  Bartender was really helpfull with drink selections for my wife, I stuck with beer.  Once seated the waitress was really nice and informative with the specials and the menu.  I had the lobster ravioli and my wife the eggplant parm, both were incredibly flavorfull and hearty.  Will definitly be going back to try other plates off their large menu."}
{"text":"Attentive! From the second we walked in the door we were well taken care of! Even on a busy Friday night! Our two children were given pizza dough to play with which was a life saver! All the staff knows team work because everyone who walked by would fill our drinks or help us with something! Love this place now!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has such good reviews. The first time I went the service was horrible and the food was just ok. I got the spaghetti which was ok but nothing to write home about. The dinner salads were decent but really, how hard is it to mess up a simple dinner salad. The bread was actually pretty good but that isn't a good thing when the bread is the highlight of the meal. My husband got the stuffed shells and those were pretty good. Even though the first experience wasn't spectacular I decided to give it one more try. What a mistake!! The second time the service was good and again the bread was very fresh and delicious but that's where it stopped. The salami on my salad was rotten. It had such an awful, spoiled taste to it I had to spit it out into a napkin. I couldn't even eat the rest of the salad after that I was so grossed out. I got the stuffed shells and this time they were just ok, not as good as they were the first time. I also got a slice of chocolate cake for dessert and even that wasn't good. It was dry and tasted days old. Definitely won't be going back to this place and still surprised at the high reviews some people give it."}
{"text":"Go early to avoid waiting, or go for (weekday) lunch. Even if you have to wait, it's SO WORTH IT! Frank has a diverse menu to delight everyone's taste, and serves massive portions. You will definitely have a take-home to enjoy tomorrow. I've loved this place for a decade and will continue to gorge myself here."}
{"text":"Bread and Caesar salads were ok.  Ordered the special, sausage parm with tomato, onion, mushrooms, Mozzarella over fettuccine.  A huge serving of pasta that was completely devoid of flavor.  Totally bland.  My wife had the shrimp linguine which was equally tasteless, a huge pile of pasta with absolutely no seasoning.  After several tastings we asked for the check.  The waitress never inquired as to why we were leaving full plates and wouldn't take it home.  That says it all.  Fifty bucks with two glasses of house wine."}
{"text":"love this Italian bistro! my fav. i would have giving 5 stars for dinner you need sometime. well about 2 hours. so do go here for a quick bit because you will be there for ever. but for an evening out this is the place for you the best Italian food comes to the table hot hot hot! i can't ever get enough!"}
{"text":"We were in from chicago and decided on this bistro on word of mouth. Outstanding from the moment we walked in the door. Frank the owner was was working the front desk and introduced himself. Great start. Diana our server was great. The food was piping hot, tasty and very reasonably priced. I will definitely come back when I return next year."}
{"text":"On our first visit we were greeted and seated by a really friendly gentleman as we find out later was the owner and our waitress Savannah treated us as family, my wife had the Chicken with Broccoli and I had the Chicken Parmesan both meals were incredible. We attempt to make it back now at least twice a month.  I might suggest the Pasta Ala Baci and the clam chowder,,, makes me hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is slow and the girl and guy at the front desk are rude and not professional. They just tell everyone 45 minute wait and look mad if you say ok.  The  hostess just stands there and talks about herself while tables are empty.  Not impressed. How can you be such a great cook and not see how bad your help is."}
{"text":"This place is not only amazing, they are consistently amazing. I don't think we've ever ordered the same thing twice, and no matter what we order, when we bring it home we both agree it is fabulous. Their lasagna, ravioli, clam chowder, meat sauce, pomodoro sauce, salmon, tiramisu, cannoli - everything we've tried has been beyond superb. Their portions are a little on the large size - I always end up with lunch for another day - but that's fine with me."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. I've eaten there several times and the food and service have always been great. Reasonably priced. It's off the beaten path to find but worth the search."}
{"text":"I travel across the country and Frank and his team consistently do the best job of bring traditional Italian food and making me feel like I'm in his home. This restaurant is a golden nugget in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners and staff are very friendly. I have never had an issue eating here. The food is authentic and delicious. It's my favorite place to eat in Queen Creek. If I moved I would drive out here just to eat there food and see the staff. You guys are great!"}
{"text":"Slipping away. Had the chicken parmesan. Tasted like a store bought frozen paddy with a lousy textured consistency. The marinara was very tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I just visited this place for the first time and we absolutely fell in love with it! Great ambiance, Fantastic staff, and delicious food! This place is a jewel!"}
{"text":"The munu was quite pricey, we were surprised by that. The place is off the beaten path and in need of a remodel, the food was just ok here, nothing special and absolutely not worth the menu prices. waitress was nice, but food was not great for the price. salads consisted of lettuce and nothing else!... wow! no croutons, tomatoes or anything to even add color! I wish them well, It just wasnt for us.  suggestions: Remodel, Lower prices, add some color to your salads, don't be afraid to use spices and seasoning, the dishes were a bit bland.

{"text":"I used Baci to cater my moms 60th birthday party and it was amazing!  People raved about the food for days! But, when we go in to eat at the restaurant it's just not as good for some reason?!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had a half chicken parm and half sausage and peppers with penne pasta. Don't know which half I liked the best!  Outstanding!!!  Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Delicious had the salmon Florentine Hold the red onions and tomatoes substitute with artichoke and mushroom"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian place in the east valley and possibly all of Phoenix!  The owner is so friendly and nice.  We used to go to their original place when we lived in Gilbert, the new building is beautiful!  When we come down to the valley, Baci's is one of the places that we look forward to visiting!  Homemade Tiramisu...to die for.....gnocchi....yummy....it's all good!"}
{"text":"Great food...and terrific sevice.  Multo Bene!  I can't wait to get my Italian craving satisfied again ."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.    The good: The portions are big, the pasta is fresh, the bread is great, and the service is good.  Me and my wife come here a lot and we love the food.  My wife always gets a seafood /pasta dish, whichever looks good that night, and I always get Pasta Ala Baci or enother pasta dish.  They are all great.  We have had the Pizza, it was a heavy good pizza, but generally we stick to the pastas. Great heavy dishes that taste great and beat any of the chain restaurants by a mile.  The bad: The owner is always there, he can be a nice guy but can also be grumpy.   We have seen him scold or lecture his staff many times in front of us and other customers.  There may be more to the stories, but it felt icky.  The other downwide, is there is often a wait to be seated.  They are a busy place, for good reason, but if you want to go you may have to wait.  They do clean tables quickly and seat people fast and I never feel rushed, so they seem to be doing everything they can.  We have come here for years and will be back."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! Went on a Yelp recondition and from NorthDakota they made a dish fresh for my sister and I had the Alfredo it was the BOMB!! It will be a regular stop for us whenever we come here!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a very open and warm feeling to it. The service was great and the food was amazing. Out of all of the Italian restaurants I've been to (not including Olive Garden...) this was the most authentic. I ordered one of the pasta dishes and the second it was served to me I was in heaven. Steamy goodness was rising from the plate and I couldn't wait to take a bite. Not only as the food good but so was the atmosphere. It was decorated perfectly and it made me feel as if I was in Italy eating at a little mom and pop restaurant. Around the time I was finishing my meal the owner came around and asked how my mother and I were doing. It made the dining experience feel more personal. Overall, this restaurant is on my top ten list and I will continue to dine there."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! Their Vodka sauce is amazing. Literally works with any pasta or meat combination. Delicious and creamy unexplainable flavor. If you like the lighter sauces the Cap-rah-co-sa (spell check) dish is a spicy garlic tomato sauce with a pomadoro consistency, my description does no justice. You have to try either dish and you'll be hooked. Support your local businesses. Frank and his 2 son's put together an incredible, truly authentic italian restaurant...... Go try them out."}
{"text":"We been wanting to try Baci for a long time.  What a huge disappointment.  The waitress was horrible.  The butter for the bread was rock hard.  The salad was nothing but lettuce.  My mom's potato waffles were frozen.  My chicken artichoke pasta was all pasta with little chicken or artichokes.  Gross.  Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best in the East Valley. The owner, Frank is great. He seated us himself after seeing my wife and I sitting in the bar waiting to be called for a table. Our server was really nice but the food was the best! Frank saw that we had ordered the Tequila Seafood and mentioned that some people complain that it was expensive. We said that this meal was worth it. Tons of seafood on a bed of angel hair pasta. We also had the raviolis. Incredible. Save room for the desserts!  Olive Garden and Oregano's are off our list of places to eat Italian food.  Manga!"}
{"text":"We had a very helpful waitress. The gnocchi with alfredo was delicious. Though they ran out of spinach, they immediatly offered grilled zucchini which was an excellent replacement in the gnocchi alfredo."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! Going into the restaurant, I wasn't really sure what to expect. The wait was not as long at all and the restaurant felt very authentic. There was a group of men singing Italian music and playing instruments inside of the dining area. The service was quick, checking up on us frequently and taking our drink orders right away. The menu had a variety of Italian dishes, making it hard to decide what to order!  After a while of looking over the menu, I finally decided to order a calzone. I ordered my calzone with peperoni and cheese as the toppings. The food was quick to come out and looked delicious! The portion sizes where pretty big and tasted great. The waitress continued to check up on us to make sure everything tasted good and we were having a nice meal. The meals where quickly filling and we had to get a couple boxes to take our food home.  Upon waiting for our bill, the owner of the restaurant came over to our table and asked us how we liked everything. He also asked us if this was our first time at the restaurant. We told him everything was great and that it was our first time. He was happy to hear we had a good time and told us he hoped to see us again soon. Overall this restaurant was one of the best, Italian restaurants I have been to in Arizona. I will definitely be coming back and telling my friends about the outstanding experience I had at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years; because it is that good. Quantity and quality live harmoniously. Quite obvious, the freshest produce utilized in the ingredients. Flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent service with an adorable wait person (a blonde young lady) and very generous portions ....  It gets crowded so go early!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today after watching the show Check Please on PBS last night.  Pretty much the entire experience left me going \"what a waste\".  Service was extremely slow the moment we walked in the door (but were very nice & friendly).  Ambiance, pretty dull and unimpressive.  The food was blah and presentation, their wasn't any.  Took almost 5 min to be noticed and seated (we were the only 2 in the lobby, once seated almost 10 min before our server spoke to us.  Bread was warm at one point but by the time it made it to us it was cold.  A good 15-20 min before our glasses of wine made it to the table.  The Pinot Grigio was very good.  The deep fried combo platter lacked flavor and was a little mushy came to the table on the cool side.  Marinara sauce was also very good.  The caesar salad & soup, lasagne and chicken parmesan were just all ok.  The worst part of it all, I believe his name is Frank (he's in the chef suit) he's walking around and he even saw all our dishes on our table and didn't blink an eye.  Well, we tried it and we won't be going back.  What a bummer of a way to spend a vacation day.  Really hoped for a better experience."}
{"text":"When arriving it would be nice to be met with a genuine smile and greeting. The menu is overwhelming and we were not offered a kid menu. The server was very good however the food came out at a snails pace. If they were to scale down and focus on a few great dishes ,(keeping it fresh), they may attract more than the local snowbirds."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Italian food I've had in years. I ordered Chicken Marsala with pasta, not only did it not look or taste like a Marsala sauce, it was so bland that even after loading it up with salt, pepper, and parmesan I could barely eat it. My husband's dish was just ok. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Of all the Italian restaurants in AZ, this one is close to the best!!! I've yet to have a bad experience or meal here. The food is superb and when you ask to change up the dish it's never a problem. Love the minestrone soup!! Highly recommend trying this gem of a place!!"}
{"text":"For some reason, from my house, it said this one was one of the closest Italian Restaurants was Baci and it was like 20 minutes away. Anyway, I had a take-out and service was pretty fast which was good.  However, the pasta and calamari, and I quote my boyfiend, \"tastes like something I could've popped from the microwaved.\" :/  Maybe it was the drive; maybe the food. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I think the lack of places to eat in QC has clouded the judgment of most of these reviewers. They wedged our small two person party in to a table that was practically on top of a huge family which made us and them uncomfortable. Our waitress was absent for 98% of the meal. The Bruscetta was terrible as the toast was soaked in butter and oil. Both pasta dishes that we ordered were good but not worth the poor service and bad appetizer."}
{"text":"First visit.  Wait staff was awesome and attentive.  The food was great italian cuisine and was done well.  We will definitely be back often.  If you havent been there, it is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. Small wait time, great service, good drinks...and the meat sauce is to die for. Had the meat trio last weekend. Sausage, filet and grilled chicken were moist, flavorful and well cooked. Rich meat sauce and good portions. Let be this place."}
{"text":"This place is so Deelish! I used to work here and it is still awesome. Family owned & ran. There is not one item on the menu that would make you leave dissatisfied. The tiramisu is homemade by the owners Aunt and shipped from Chicago. It is absolutely, undeniably the best tiramisu ever!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Love the pasta a la Baci, ask them to add chili to give it a little kick. Then some lemon chelo cake to finish it off! They also have this younger Mexican waitress that is drop dead gorgeous and very helpful."}
{"text":"This Is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the east valley. My wife and I went to Italy a few years back and we are always on the hunt for authentic Italian. And This place it right on point, never been disappointed. And portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Big mistake going on a Sat. night; it was really busy and the \"Bar\" area is a serious joke. 4 high top tables with the bar tucked in a corner... Seriously, who did the lay out for this place?? Naturally, the service was ridiculously slow because we made the mistake of going at 7:30. Little things like the dinner salad being all green leaf lettuce and Not iceberg make me very happy and the Italian dressing was great. Our dinners were very good which saved them from getting 2 stars from me. Yes, the \"Bar\" combined with the unreasonably slow service stopped us from ordering dessert. Definitely, worth the drive, but not on the weekend nights. Will re-rate next time we go."}
{"text":"Baci Italian bistro is the jewel of Queen Creek! Worth the drive! You must try the Creamy chicken marcella. The pizza is very good. Make sure you call ahead, because there is always a wait."}
{"text":"Treats there year round customers second class when the winter visitors come to town!  No loyalty to those that come and spend money during the slow times."}
{"text":"We have dined at this restaurant about 6 times now. It is always delicious! The portions are great, and the prices are very affordable. My husband and I usually share the Lasagna with Meat Sauce. We each order soup as well. My favorite is the Minestrone. There is a Tomato soup they also make that I love, but it is a hit or miss whether they will have that. Our server told us last night, if we know we are going to be there, let them know a day in advance, and they will make it for us.  How awesome is that!"}
{"text":"Great food, definitely the best part of this restaurant.  Not quite 5 stars for the food, but very good.  The 2 stars is for everything else.  Unless you have a party of 6 or more and can make a reservation, forget it. Even with a reservation, you'll have to wait.  Their lobby is small and waiting is not comfortable    The owner is a nice guy, but tends to seat his friends before regular customers.  Even on an average day, expect to wait at least 1-1.5 hours just to get a table.  Turnaround time to eat and leave is at least 3 hours.  No food is that good, sorry."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food. The bread is delicious and we don't need a special occasion to come here for dinner."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The prices are reasonable, about $40-50 for a family of four. I REALLY loved the bruschetta, the vegetables were so fresh and the bread was perfect. I had the minestrone soup which tastes homemade, it was good but not as good as Olive Gardens. The service was nice and I think the owner of the restaurant even came up to us and asked us how we were doing, he seems like a nice guy. The only thing is that we had to wait in line for about an hour so check the wait times before going."}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting out of town relatives and have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Interior of the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated with a fairly even distribution of both booths and stand alone tables. Our wait, for a Saturday evening was a reasonable 7 minutes and the restaurant was fairly busy at the time.   Our waiter Steve was excellent and very well informed with regard to the menu and possible variations. 5 Stars for Steve.   The food was very good and there was an abundance of it!  Best of all, we got out of here for a very reasonable price and they even honored a $5 off coupon that was sent to me via text and was only on my phone.   Is highly recommend stopping here from some excellent Italian Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Visited last night with a party of 10.  Food was very good, maybe a little too much sauce on some dishes and proteins were a scarce but the flavors were spot on and authentic.  Owner and service were a class act and very willing to do whatever is needed to make the customer happy.  Location is a little off the beaten path but worth the drive. Everyone at our table was very satisfied with their dinners and the portions of the pasta were very generous.  Much better than any of the chain Italian restaurants in the area. 3 of the couples we were with had been there multiple times and have never been disappointed. Looking forward to the next time I go there."}
{"text":"I've had great Italian in the East Valley but Baci just may be the best place I've found. Their Italian is very authentic and it's not super heavy. They add delicious flavor to all of their food without overdoing the grease and fat, which I love.  I enjoyed the Melini Chianti wine, fresh bread with dipping oil and vinegar, calamari, portobello mushrooms with marinade and fresh melted mozzarella, Caesar salad, and the pasta primavera with arrabbiata sauce with linguine noodles. It was heaven! I've never had a pasta sauce that was so delicious and full of flavor.   My family also greatly enjoyed their meals and the service was exquisite. Do expect the dining to take longer as the food is made very fresh and in house.   This will hands down become our new Italian spot. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Love love love their veal selections! We had veal parm, chicken parm, caprese salad . Everything was exceptional."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give more stars but for the amount of money we spent for 2 adults and a child combined with the time it took to get our food and be waited on I just can't do it. The food was very good and that gets 3 stars.  We waited over an hour to be seated after being told it would be 30 minutes. Once being seated everything took longer than it should. We arrived at 5:45 and our dinner wasn't over until 9:30pm. Ridiculous.  I'm not sure if we will give it another try. We did like the decor but if the service and wait is always like that it's not worth it."}
{"text":"We arrived tonight at 2:30 not realizing it didn't open til 4. While we were deciding out front where we should go next Frank, the owner, came out to see what our party of 6 was doing. After telling him our mistake of arriving 1 1/2 hours early he said to just come on in anyway. He escorted us to our table and Diana, a SUPER gal, waited on us and we enjoyed our evening. They made it great fun and the food was GREAT! We will return. We had a ton of food, wine dessert and coffee. Took a large amount home."}
{"text":"My family and I really like this place! I have been there with my wife and kids, as a couple and with my whole family of 20+ people. We always have good service and everyone has always enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"We came with high expectations but are extremely disappointed. We were excited about the food but ended up not even staying because we were so unimpressed with the staff. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a party of two. The Saturday before Valentine's Day without a reservation we understood. When 45 minutes became an hour and then an hour and 15 minutes we realized we wouldn't have time to eat and make our other plans. The worst part? They took 4 parties who arrived AFTER us before us. I'm sure the food is great but not sure we'll ever give it another try."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place last night and were told there was a 30 minute wait. Normally I would not wait that long, but I wasn't starving, so I figured what the hell. We ended up waiting just a few minutes shy of one hour to be seated. Yes you read that correctly, one hour. Never ever ever ever have I waited one hour at a restaurant to be seated. I do realize that there's not a lot they can do about that if it's because there are a ton of people trying to eat there. But their estimate of wait was drastically off! I decide to order the creamy chicken marsala, which I have never had anywhere. When the entrée hit the table it was exactly 1 hour and 45 minutes from the time that we arrived at this establishment. By the way my dish was $16.95 if I remember correctly it was a bit surprised that a bowl of pasta or I guess I should say a plate of pasta showed up with mushrooms and chicken on the top. Hopefully I can attach a photo. I immediately asked them if the chicken was tossed throughout the pasta or if it was added at the top. She didn't seem confident with her answer but she did tell me it was tossed throughout. I decided to pick out the chicken because it really did not look like much. I know this because I actually weigh my food. The meal came with approximately 2 ounces of chicken which is pretty sad... I thought dishes like this came with a chicken breast so you actually knew how much you were getting. At no point during our visit did they do anything other than be friendly because of our wait. When I asked about the food they didn't ask why and at the end when I told the owner that I an hour and 45 minutes went by before entrées hit the table, he said that that was good jokingly. No offer of a price break, no offer of a dessert, just suck it up and pay the bill. He may be very friendly but to me that it's not the customer service he should be providing. I'm sure they won't miss me not coming back..."}
{"text":"First off, I have eaten here over 40 times in 12 years even at the previous location in Gilbert  and have always enjoyed the food, but tonight's experience was horrific!! Frank the owner, is off on Mondays, I guess, and when I brought my concern to his son about my meal he told me to \"get over it\". After spending $120 on 3 adults and a child I was not about to just \"get over it\". I always order the same dish with ariabata sauce and when my shrimp and scallops came out with marinara sauce I politely told our server there was a mistake. I was told to \"sprinkle some red pepper on it\". It definitely did not taste the same and when I made mention this to Frank's son I couldn't believe the treatment I received!!! Even the waitress whom we've known for many years kept apologizing to us. So sad to see this restaurant that we have loved for many years go downhill so quickly the second that Frank is not in the building. It will be a long time before we spend our money there again!!"}
{"text":"Very good service, Angelica very friendly and polite she did a great job, we were there on a Weds around 730pm and no complaining we would be last ones out. Great quality and quanity, bartender very friendly, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Have been here three times now since they move the to their new location. When they first moved to the new location, I thought this would be a mistake for them. A very out of the way location just West of Ellsworth on Germann.. Boy was I wrong!!!   Third time through last night. Went with visiting family. We were late getting out the door for dinner so did not get there until almost 7:30 p.m. The parking lot was packed as was the restaurant.   Now, I have to say one thing before I move on... It is one thing to go out to dinner with family/friends to enjoy an evening out. I am all about sitting around the table for a nice conversation and laughs... But if you have finished your meal and find that  you are sitting around all the while the restaurant is packed with people waiting for a table, then maybe it is time to pack up and leave. It is the respectful thing to do. It is one thing to sit around a table when the restaurant is not very busy.. But when it is packed and there is a line out the door, taking up space to sit around and talk for hours is not only rude to the waiting people, but the staff that have to service your table. The server makes money based on tips and therefore is dependent on the number of people that they can get through their tables. Not too mention the restaurant itself that is dependent on the number of customers it can service to make money.  When you sit around, you are hurting their ability to make money. Move to the bar or simply get out. But don't take up a table for hours after you have finished your meal when there are people waiting.   With that said, we arrived to a packed restaurant. We were told that it would be about 35 minutes, but with the VERY RUDE couple of tables that wanted to sit around and talk, it ended up being an hour...   They do take reservations. And I would recommend them or getting there early, before 5:30 if you don't want to wait. At least on a Friday or Saturday night..   Table ordered:  Pepperoni Pizza, Baked Stuffed Shells with Meat Sauce, Shrimp & Asparagus in Vodka Sauce on Angel Hair - Special of Night, and Chicken and Shrimp Capricioso with Angel Hair.   All food was very good. Very traditional Italian.   No appetizers for table last night, but have had the Bruschetta in past and it has been very good.   Table is also supplied with unlimited fresh baked bread which is outstanding.   In the past have had several different pasta dishes. And also the Chicken Parmigiana. All have been very good.   Service is very slow, which is why I don't provide the 5th Star. And has been each time we have been there. Staff just does not seem to be in any hurry.   I also happened to watch while the owner appeared to be training a new waitress at front of house. Was close enough that I could over hear him giving lectures and teaching. Then watched as he went over different wines on menu. Now, as slow as the service is, I would think that you would find a better time to train instead of Friday night at the busiest time...   But give it a try. You won't be disappointed. But plan ahead. You cannot be in a hurry when you go..."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today. We meet the owner, Frank. I told him that I hated eggplant. So he made me and my wife a sample piece of his eggplant. It was delicious! I still hate eggplant, anywhere but here! I had a lunch special which was minestrone soup, and a dish of sliced sausage and pasta with a delicious sauce. Absolutely fantastic! And the service was great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I Googled Italian food nearby(south Gilbert) and this restaurant happened to be the closest location...so we gave it a shot, reluctantly. We brought our two yr old daughter who was beyond tired and she was in rare form to say the least. Shortly after being seated we reconsidered our decision because we didn't want to ruin the other guests dinner so we started to get up and just place our order to go. It was at this point that Frank, the owner, stopped by our table and completely won our daughters heart! The entire staff placated our daughter so we could enjoy our meal and the food was genuinely delish! Our experience was beyond pleasant and I adamantly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! and worth the trip to Queen Creek!  I am sad that this place is in such a low traffic area, I fear that may be the death of it.  I was stunned as I walked in the front door, I was expecting a simple cafe with a few tables and chairs around them.  What i found was elegant (however I felt completely comfortable in my shorts t-shirt and flops) dining room made to feel as if you are sitting in a Italian enclosed courtyard complete with a fountain in the middle of the dining room!  I love food, I love Italian food a lot, and I am picky.  This is the BEST I have had in Arizona!  Their eggplant Parmesan was phenomenal, perfectly breaded and prepared.  The staff is super friendly, as my friend and I walked in (during lunch) a man, who I took to be the chef, greeted us and asked us if we were \"real hungry?\"  I being a very large young man as well as my friend no dainty guy himself naturally answered \"yes.\"  I think we may have inadvertently challenged him.  Though we both ordered off the \"lunch menue\" (which may I add they have extremely affordable lunch prices under $10) I cannot imagine what was brought out to us were their normal \"lunch portions.\"  4 pieces of eggplant, easily enough for 2-3 meals (I however, feeling it would be rude to tell the chef I was \"real hungry\" and then not clean my plate..... almost hurt myself, but I did clean the plate.... I advise a to-go box)  I cannot praise Baci Italian Bistro enough, it is great, go ready to have a good time and you will not be disappointed.  I recommend this for a casual lunch or a romantic dinner for two, you will not go wrong at Baci Italian Bistro!"}
{"text":"So glad that my hubby and I tried this restaurant tonight for our Anniversary dinner. We're new to the area and we were craving some pasta. Baci has great food and the service was amazing. Our waitress, Angelica was awesome! Thank you, we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! An incredible Italian bistro bordering our little Town of Queen Creek. Love the food! Love the ambiance! Love the owner who makes you feel like family:-) And as far as waiting for the home cooked fresh delicacies, all I can say is you get what you wait for, just like any other fine restaurant:-) Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here!  The owner is always fun to visit with and the recipes are authentic.  Dinners portions are substantial so my wife and I often fill up on one entree."}
{"text":"We had our holiday party for work here. Very beautiful venue. Newer interior. Clean. The food was delicious. Would like to visit again, as we didn't actually order from the menu (it was more catered at their venue)."}
{"text":"I need to start off by saying Italian food is definitely not my favorite but it was my Uncle's birthday and he wanted to come here. We met for dinner Friday night and the place was packed so be prepared to wait for a table. My sister had to wait about 30 minutes. You could tell our server was new but she was very attentive and friendly.    We ordered the bruschetta before our meal which was very scrumptious. The portions were massive. My Uncle has the Chicken  Parmigiana which he loved. My sister and I had a salad. She has the Shrimp Caesar while I had the dinner salad. Both were also quite large and very yummy. We topped it off with chocolate cake to go and called it a night. Great food and service! We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Have been going to it for years! (Even when they were at their old location 10 min away).  The family atmosphere and the staff/owner is great.   Always treat you like family.   All of the wait staff is polite and attentive.  Only downside is that when it gets busy, you better be patient! Easily could be an hour or longer.  The food quality is great.  Can definitely get pricey, especially with a larger party.  But we visit once in a while and it's a great time."}
{"text":"Save your money and get a jar of Prego and box of pasta from the store because that's pretty much the quality of the food at this place.  The owner scolds the wait staff in the dining room and the waitresses are surely.  $20 for a plate of pasta Alfredo - definitely not worth it"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants- worth the drive. Great fresh bread to start- my wife and I split the chicken Parmesan with vodka sauce- each getting our own salad. Never leave hungry and sometimes save room for a cannoli for dessert."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Queen Creek and Baci is Queen Creek-adjacent.  Had done my research on new places to try and this was at the top of the list, plus had a rave review from  my brother.    We have two restaurant.com gift certificates to use at Baci but they are for lunch Tuesday through Thursday and we wanted Italian food tonight so we just went for it at full price.  Well worth it!  Got there a little before 7:00 pm and had about a 7 minute wait.  The tables weren't all full but it looked like they were mainly seating in booths and leaving the tables open for larger parties.  The wait wasn't bad and the owner came over and talked to the couple ahead of us and when they were seated, turned his attention to us.  He is very charming and great at making his guests feel welcome and comfortable.    The decor is nice and the booths are roomy and comfortable with high backs that afford privacy and would be great for a romantic date.  There was no music playing when we first arrived but someone turned it on about halfway through our meal and it was old standards, very nice and relaxing.    Also TVs positioned all around with sports on so if you're into watching TV while waiting for your meal, you can certainly catch some type of sporting event.    Now for the important part--the food!    Appetizer - Fried Ravioli:  The ravioli themselves were okay and probably the only reason I am not giving Baci 5 stars.  They weren't bad but they weren't great either.  However the marinara that accompanied them was OUTSTANDING.  Entrees are served with a choice of soup or salad so I'll throw my opinion of those in here too.  I had the salad with Italian dressing.  The greens were crisp and fresh, lots of romaine and a few other baby greens.  I am not a fan of croutons but Baci's are obviously made in house and were delicious.  The Italian dressing was slightly creamy and tart and just outstanding.  My husband had a cup of the soup of the day, which was meatball.  He loved it and the one little taste I had was very flavorful.    Bread:  Kind of odd to have the bread come out after the appetizer but it was a wonderful crusty loaf of ciabatta with butter.  There was oil and vinegar at the table if we'd wanted to dip the bread instead of using butter but I am a huge butter fan.  Swiping the marinara off the plate after eating the fried ravioli was heavenly!  Entrees -- Lasagna with Meat Sauce and Linguine with Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Butter Sauce:  I'll go with the easy one first.  The lasagna was at least seven layers with lots of gooey mozzarella on top and the meat sauce was so very good.  I could barely make it through half before I gave up and had the rest boxed up to bring home.  Leftover lasagna is one of the best things ever!  Now on to the Linguine.  The linguine and seafood list was extensive and I know how my husband loves that combination so I pointed it out to him fully expecting he'd choose the option with shrimp and scallops.  I would never order such a thing because usually Italian restaurants overcook the seafood.  But he is more forgiving than I so he went for it.  There were six sauce choices and my husband went for the garlic butter sauce.  Excellent choice!  I had just a bite of the linguine with sauce initially and could have eaten a whole bowl of that.  Finally gave in and sampled a scallop and a shrimp and both were sweet and cooked perfectly.  What a fabulous dish!  Totally changes my opinion of seafood dishes at an Italian restaurant.    Dessert -- Limoncello Cake:  We were stuffed but agreed to look at the dessert menu anyway.  I was ambivalent but my husband loves dessert and then our server mentioned the Limoncello Cake that wasn't even listed on the menu.  She said it was the best thing and she was completely right.  When it first came out I was thinking the cake might be dense and a little dry and then I took a bite and it was light and airy and lemony.  Sublime.  We should have ordered two slices.  I also ordered a cup of coffee and even that was wonderful.  I had to fight my husband for the coffee because he wanted to try one sip and kept going back for more.  Luckily he's not supposed to have caffeine so he finally had to stop.    The service was good but I think our server may have been under the weather because she and the owner had a little convo at the server station next to our booth and he was trying to send her home.  She was still pleasant and attentive but you could tell she might be having an off night.  Every server and bus person I saw seemed to have a great attitude.    Our total for all of this and two soft drinks was around $70 including a slightly above 20% tip.  I'd say pricing-wise things are just about what you'd expect for excellent quality food.   Obviously with gift certificates to use we will be going back but even if we didn't, we'd want to go."}
{"text":"Visiting from back East, we dropped our teenage son at the skate place around the corner and Yelped for a nice place to eat -- and we found one! Friendly family vibe with tasty fresh food at reasonable prices. Our two salads were excellent and so was the meatball special. A definite find!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What yumminess!  Apps were just ok (had the calamari and the fried mushrooms), but the caprese salad was awesome!  Chopped tomatoes in a bowl with slices of mozz on top, and a balsamic.dressing in the bottom.  So delicious!  One of the best I've had.  Had the creamy chicken marsala (over linguine) and HOLY CRAP was it AMAZING!!!  One of the best pasta dishes I've had in my life.  Tremendous flavors!  Who knew I'd drive to Queen Creek before I'd eat Italian in Mesa?  Nice!"}
{"text":"We'd given up on ever eating decent Italian food in the East Valley until my neighbor mentioned Baci. We tried it last week and I'm a fan! The arrabbiata sauce was perfectly spicy and the meat sauce was delicious! Prices are good and I look forward to going back to try the chicken limone!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The owner is almost always there. Chicken parm and fettuccine are standouts."}
{"text":"Baci is one of the best ( if not the best) Italian Restaurants we've encountered.   The food, service, ambiance and personal interaction with the owner has made Baci one of our good to restaurants!"}
{"text":"Tried to go to Oregano's for dinner last night at 5:30.  Parking lot overflowing, thank goodness as we went to Baci on Germann Rd and discovered a GEM or a restaurant.  Will make reservations next time as it is busy and full of diners. Greeted right away as we walked in.    As the owner moved around the restaurant he very warmly engaged pretty much everyone including us unknowns.  Seemed very warm and genuine. No reservations told the wait would be about 10 minutes and it was, spot on. Seated at a booth next to the windows and our waitress was with us promptly with menus and taking drink orders, not pushy just prompt. Our salads arrived and the Caesar's were delicious, part of your meal.  Ordered the Penne with Vodka sauce and it was the 2nd best I have had. All the food was good. Saw reviews about the need of a remodel, bad salads etc. we did not have any of that.  Staff was attentive and friendly. The owner walks about engaging his customers who he treats as true guests, very engaging. Food was prompt service was spot on.   Definitely going back and taking friends to introduce them to Baci's."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden and facing away from the street so if your like me you'll pass it and not realize that its located in a some what look a like shopping plaza. I don't have a lot to say about this place other than the fact that the decor is nice throughout the restaurant, bathrooms are very cool and modern looking and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! By far one of my favorite restaurants. It's a little fancy, which I like and I truly felt like I was welcomed into the home of an Italian family! The food was delicious! The tea was also great :) the waitress , I think her name may have been Dianne but I'm not sure, was very nice and helpful and this cute Italian man also helped us and cleared things out of the way. You can tell he truly works hard. I never take leftovers home because they don't get eaten but there was no way I was letting this amazing food go to waste! I will be back! Again.. And again!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 but it's only great, not perfect.  The owner really takes pride in his product and the employees have been there for years.  My family and I have never had a meal there we did not like.   They also don't mind when you ask for something done your way, not theirs.  First of they bring you fresh homemade bread. Yeah, they make it from scratch.  Their Minestrone is very good.   Their pizza is very good as well. I order it a little thinner, a little more crispy and a little less cheese. Really.  Great sauce, crust and toppings.   They might have a pan but I have never asked. I have never had a good pan pizza outside of Chicago. Never. Not even from a restaurant  that says they are a Chicago place.  I have also never found a good egg roll outside of Chicago either but that not Frank's problem.  I have also had the Chicken Vesuvio. Good but not great. The best Vesuvio is made with bone in chicken and baked, not grilled. But this is AZ so what do you want.  The Canolli , yum. The other deserts are pretty good as well.  So far this is the best Chicago transplant I have found. Better than Rosati's or Oreganos. I'm lucky it's not closer to my house. If it was Id be as fat as one of their Jumbo Pies.  It is one of my three top Chicago Places."}
{"text":"Update: We've been dining at Baci for the past two years, but never tried the pizza. We ordered takeout pizzas last Sunday evening and I have to say that our entire family was IMPRESSED!  The Chicken Alfredo with Bacon - and the pepperoni, mushroom, sausage were equally outstanding.  The toppings were plentiful and fresh. I'm going to have a hard time deciding between the Orange Roughy Piccata and the pizza the next time we dine at Baci!   Bonus: It's always nice to see the owner mingling in the dining room ensuring guests' enjoyment and comfort."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I have had in Arizona since moving here from New York!  The restaurant is very pretty, clean and nicely decorated.  The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. The manager/owner makes the rounds and mingles with the diners. I like that!  We split two appetizers, bruschetta (delicious) and rice balls with marinara dipping sauce.  We had various dinners and tasted them all:  veal Parmesan was excellent. Nicely prepared veal.  Creative seafood combo with mixed seafood and linguine.  Yum.  Veal Milanese has terrific flavor.  Eggplant Parmesan was really good too.  Save room for dessert if you can. The cannoli and chocolate cake were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food in Pinal County! If you haven't tried Baci Italian Bistro, make a reservation and make your way over! We ordered the Bruschetta for an appetizer (which was so delicious). For my main course, I got the Seafood Basil Pomodoro with linguine pasta and my husband got the chicken alfredo pizza. We were both stuffed and super happy when we left. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Baci since their first location on power road. Frank the owner is so great always making it feel like a home cooked meal. He has catered our family weddings, birthday parties and there is always no question the food with be amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a terrific restaurant! The atmosphere, service, food & prices are fantastic! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The wait here was FOREVER. They told yo it would be a 30 min wait, but it was 60 mins! I wound have accepted the wait time being 60 mins if that expectation was set.   Now, about the food. We ordered the fried ravioli for our appetizer. It was DELICIOUS. I think it was stuffed with ricotta and some other cheeses. The red sauce that was served with it, so good.   The bread, HOW DO YOU STOP EATING IT?!   We shared the chicken & broccoli Alfredo. The meal came with a salad or soup. I picked a salad, it was good. The pasta dish was great. One review indicated that there wasn't enough chicken in the dish. My dish had tons of chicken in!! So much that we didn't eat all the chicken. I loved the flavor of the sauce and that my dish had lots of sauce. It was so good.   Our server was fantastic! She was apologetic for the wait. She took our orders when we were ready and just on top of everything. She made up for the long wait.   To end the night, we tried their Nutella cheesecake. It was BOMB. A must try. We would definitely come back here and just anticipate a 60 min wait, regardless of what we're told."}
{"text":"We went to Baci to celebrate with family.  They were extremely accommodating.  The food was good.   Minor issues: I do think that the server should be less concerned with us keeping our silverware after the salad course. Just go get some clean forks and hand them out.  Also the Fox news playing on every TV is just disconcerting when you are trying to enjoy a night out.  Propaganda and pasta just don't mix.    Otherwise, fantastic.  I would recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down one of my husband's and my favorite spots for date night! The owner is friendly and the food is fresh and soooo good! Chicken parm is our go-to dish. They always do their best to accommodate dietary needs, letting you swap out items with no extra charges. We love this spot and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Family of 4, Sunday at 5:30. Took a few min to get seated because they were pretty busy. Our server Stephen came to take drink and app orders right away. We got a nice loaf of bread to snack on while waiting. We ordered calamari, caprese salad, chicken broccoli fettuccini Alfredo, kids spaghetti and meatball, chicken limon, penne and meatballs. The portions were very large and after apps, salad, soup and bread all of us had to take home leftovers. Food was piping hot and service was excellent. The place was clean and people were very nice. My Long Island was on point."}
{"text":"If you have never physically been to Italy, now you can! Just visit Baci in Mesa, AZ!!!  This is a tiny place on the corner of Williams Field Road and Power Rd and YOU WILL MISS it if your eyes aren't peeled.  It is a family owned restaurant who's history is nicely printed on each of the menus.  Great story too, it makes you feel like you are helping a underdog family by eating there.  The atmosphere is okay.  Not the best building for an italian restaurant, but it serves its purpose.  Drop ceiling tiles and plastic tableclothes were the only downside to this restaurant.  Once you can get passed this, you will enjoy your visit.  Most of the parking lot is dirt/broken asphalt so be careful getting out of your car.  The food, on the other hand, is brilliant!  They have daily specials, lunch menus, and great drinks!  I recommend the bruschetta and the veal parmagiano.  Lunch time is a great time for an italian sandwich, they make them fresh!  Once you order your food you will notice that the service is unlike ANY other.  They will constantly come back to your table to make sure your experience is top notch.  If anything is wrong, they will fix it on the spot.  I couldn't GET them to stop bringing me warm pumpernickel and butter!   The price is great and the food is unbeatable.  Make this place your own little secret, because (as of now) no one knows about it!  This would have been a five star review had it not been for the atmosphere.  Poorly maintained parking lot, and overlooked details brought it down to a four.  However, they are aware of the problem.  They have blueprints of their new site in the main lobby.  i can't wait! Go there, now!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was super good! Fried ravioli to start, crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli in vodka sauce for dinner. Salad was crisp and fresh, bread was good and the waitress was on top of everything. Wish we had one in California."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Baci, and it was a hidden jewel!!!  How did we not know about this place before?!  The lasagna was huge, and just perfectly balanced between cheese, meat and folds of pasta.  The chicken cordon bleu was amazing, and on the secret menu. Be sure to ask for it!!!"}
{"text":"What happened?! I went here a few times and it was impeccable. It was a next level eating experience.   But recently I've gone and it was worse than Olive Garden. I wish I knew what happened and why but this seems like a classic case of saving costs and cutting corners. I hope it gets back to normal soon. Otherwise I doubt it's worth a trip."}
{"text":"Love this family restaurant! The food, dessert & wine is delicious & everyone is always so friendly. Including the owner :) They even sell fresh eggs from a local farm. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian meal is the chicken cacciatore. I have been to several Italian restaurants here in the east valley including scottsdale and this is the only place that Ive seen that has cacciatore on the menu. Having said that it was excellent. The pasta was cooked just right. The sauce and spices used gave it that classic flavor without being salty. A lot places make up for taste by adding too much salt. The price value for the portion was excellent. For $16.00 it fed two people. The bread loaf was hot and fresh out of the oven. For desert we had one slice of chocolate cake which again was big enough to share. The atmosphere was low key. The decor was a cross of old Italian mixed in with a few flat screens tvs mouted high and can be seen from almost anywhere you sit. The service was excellent. The waitress was very familiar with the menu and was very polite and courteuos. The location is in an odd place just off of Ellsworth and Germann Rd, but lucky for us, its not far from our home. If this place was in scottsdale the price would be much higher and there would be long wait times. Needless to say I give this place a top rating for all what I mentioned above."}
{"text":"We've been there twice, i had the tortellini paisano both times.  Now keep in mind i was stationed in Italy for 6 months, this is one of the best dishes I've ever had, PERIOD!!!  You must have desert!   The house Cab is great too.  Infact everything was top notch!!  The owner (i think) was friendly like you were a guest at his house.   Steve (if i recall correctly) was out waiter and he was great also.   Its a bit of a drive for us but well worth it.    I only have one small, minuscule complaint, why is there a TV?  The atmosphere is great but a tv is more dinner vs fine dining.     A five star among 5 stars,  just dump the tv."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing the restaurant on Check Please. Went on a Friday for lunch. Service was very slow. Though I think we had the a waitress with an off day. Being from the midwest, we were eager to try the food. Unfortunately, the food was OK at best. I had a lasagna that was served lukewarm and girlfriend had an unimpressive chicken parmesan. Maybe we went on an off day. Based on the reviews we expected much better. Is it possible the high rankings are from people that live in the same remote area and are just happy to have a restaurant near by? I don't know. But they left quite a bit of room for improvement on the food. I would not call this true Chicago style italian food. At least not from what I know about Chicago food. The owner/chef stopped at about every table but ours to ask how things were going. I overheard people complain to him about the slow service. But, for some reason he did not choose to stop by us, even after seeing the pile of empty drink glasses and dirty appetizer, salad and soup dishes that sat on our table almost the rest of the meal. Won't be back"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian cuisine (NOT that garbage served at the highly-overrated \"O\" restaurant), the Baci is the place to go. On our first visit there, we met the owner's son Frankie, who was friendly and extremely accommodating. His father arrived shortly thereafter - Frank Sr. - and we met him too. From speaking with him, it is apparent that he is proud of his restaurant - and should be!  First of all, it is quite a drive - seems like we drove forever in fact, and we live in central Gilbert! It's in a shopping plaza but it's a stand-alone building. The decor is OK, with a Mediterranean feel, though the paint treatment on the walls meant to look like stucco ain't fooling anyone. Wine selection was very good, and they have a full bar. Service is very good, but can be slow at times, which is what you would expect from an authentic Italian restaurant.  The food was absolutely fabulous. As someone who grew up in New York, I would consider myself a connoisseur of Italian food and Baci hits the mark. I chose the Chicken Parmesan but we were with a group of 16 people and enjoyed sampling each other's selections. The menu has many, many diverse selections.  Again about the service - here's an example of how great they are. I ordered my meal but I'm not really one for the traditional spaghetti marinara served on the side. I asked the server what I might be able to substitute. He responded - \"What would you like?\" That's right - not \"You can have this, or that, or the other thing,\" but he wanted to know what I wanted to have! What a concept! I decided on bowtie pasta with alfredo, which was wonderful.  My only wish is that this place was closer to us, but we look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Tried to eat the left over clams and linguine. It was full of sand and inedible!"}
{"text":"A perfect dinner with superb wait staff. An abundance of deliciousness we had to take home leftovers 2 extra meals and an 18\" half cheese half meatball sausage cheese. With some very tough competition BACI has moved into first place as my favorite go to restaurant 45-50 minutes from our Maricopa home. We couldn't T eT everything but the creative menu with sauce and pasta choices as no cost options5 STARS PLUS.Quality seasoning and creative choices all old school cooking.Get a little bit of everything and enough the delicious just as good if not better reheated leftover. Highway exit all the way and then 5 minutes to the restaurant. Excellent owner runs a beautiful comfortable restaurant like clockwork. If you have to wait then wait. We had another fabulously comfortable dinner and will bring all our future guests here. Only the ones who can appreciate the finer food in life. Priced you get more than you pay for. Only wish I lived next door!"}
{"text":"We ate at Baci Italian Bristro last Wednesday and had a great time.  Great food and great service.  Baci Italian Bristro is not the cheapest Italian food in the valley but for what you get, the food is not over priced.  The dishes we received were very much enjoyed by the party who ordered it, so I would say again the evening was a great success, a great time for all.  Would recommend you try it."}
{"text":"First Time I've Had Good Italian Food in the Valley! I've lived in this area for six years and never found a good Italian restaurant - Phoenix, Scottsdale or anywhere. Then my daughter told me about Baci and we went there for dinner with family this evening. First, service could not have been any better - quick and attentive. We were there early Saturday evening - maybe it slows down when it gets busy later in the evening, but I couldn't find one thing to complain about when we were there. The food is fresh, real authentic Italian food. Need I say more? If you're used to the typical American Italian fare - overcooked pasta with tons of heavy sauce dumped on top of it, you may not like Baci, but if you've eaten in Italy and like your food the way they cook it in Italy, you'll love Baci!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian food. The only place we'll eat Italian. Huge helpings, you'll be taking some home. We've been customers for 10 years and never had a bad experience. The owner Frank and his son Frankie are wonderful as well as the staff. Over the years we've had almost everything on their menu. Our favorites are Pasta Paisano, Lasagna, Chicken Portobello, Pasta ala Baci and any Gnocchi dish. Their Vodka sauce is excellent as well as the Minestrone soup and we've never been disappointed with any of the daily specials. If you don't see something on the menu ask, my son likes spinach sauted in garlic & olive oil (sometimes with his Gnocchi) and they always make it for him. I've noticed some reviews talking about slow service. This is an Ialian restaurant, sit back relax, sip your wine and eat. It's not a place to \"suck and run\". Take your family and friends and enjoy your evening. Mangia!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Busy on weekends, they don't take reservations for less then 6 people. But you can wait for your table in the bar. The alfredo sauce is to die for. Portion sizes are huge. Everyone walks out with doggie bag. We eat here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Love going to Baci there is always excellent food and service.  Creamy Chicken Marcella and the Manicotti were superb.  The portion sizes are large but be sure and save room for their chocolate cake to share with your party.  Great restaurant."}
{"text":"I have had dinner here over 10 times.  (B - B+)  Food has always been good.  Owner nice guy. Comfortable setting. Today I am in town and went in to get lunch to go. Woman was polite, and explained the three various and confusing menus.  I spent $13.00 for lunch including a tip, and head back to my temporary office to eat my pasta and soup.  No silverware or napkins in the bag.  I call and very nicely explain that at this point I can't come back for what should have been provided or at least asked if I needed it.  I guess for this price I should have not taken for granted that it would be in the bag. There is no way I can eat  my pasta or soup without a fork or spoon and the nature of this food requires a napkin. The woman then explained to me they are doing what all other restaurants are doing including McDonalds,and have stopped providing napkins and plastic dinner utensils. When I attempted to explain they are not a fast food restaurant and lunch was $13.00 she talked over me and was not interested in what a client had to offer.  Just yesterday I walked into a McDonalds and there was no shortage of napkins, silverware was provided with the pancake breakfast without asking, and ketchup was available out of a tap. I called a friend who was coming by in 30 -45 minutes and asked him to bring utensils.  He stopped at Wendy's and brought me a matched set of silverware where they still provide it so when eating chili, salads or baked potato you don't have to eat with your fingers.   Not happy and am not going to eat cold food.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I dont like to eat out at Italian food places so I got the pizza here, last time I checked pizza does count as Italian food. The pizza was just not that good for the price that you pay here, for this price you can go get Oregano's pizza which is way better. I did taste my wife's pasta she got and I didnt like that either. Maybe it is just me but I feel like I can make better pasta buying the items myself from the store.   The place is very nice inside and is very well kept. Even the bathrooms are very clean. I thought it was kinda funny that they had romantic songs playing in the men's bathrooms.  We ate here over 2 months ago and have never returned so that means something right? if you crave Italian food and you live near here maybe they have something for you."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite restaraunt, we always end up here and have been faithful customers for over 13 years! We came on a night a week ago or so where a monsoon was going on outside and the power went out, probably around 7 pm. The owner and staff handled it seamlessly, managing with no lights and computers being down. Frank, the owner and his staff made the entire menu available to us and loaded up our table with candles for lighting. Our food was amazing, and we finished up with cannolis as usual (MUST TRY!). We lovvvve Baci. Gets busy on weekends, but it's so worth the wait."}
{"text":"A kid friendly place with great drinks, and a very full menu of awesome meals. I asked to modify a dish slightly and it was absolutely no big deal. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of our classic faves in the area. We've been coming here since they were at the old location! Best pizza, authentic Chicago style pizza (and no, that doesn't mean pan pizza, it just means a thicker crust), fantastic pastas, and a great atmosphere.  Always great service, always great food, and if you ever have the slightest issue they always happily make it right. Thats the difference! We all make mistakes, but its how you handle it and treat the customer that determines if they'll come back or not."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  A great place to go if you're wanting sit back and relax with good company, great food and wine.   We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm really sold! Went there today with the fam and thought it was great! They were really nice and the food was great! Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"The service was very excellent from the minute we walked in. It has a very family vibe- just like any good Italian resteraunt should do. The owner is up front- greeting customers and very involved in his business. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The glasses were never empty. The service was very well paced and so was the meal.  Amazing food. My husband and I shared the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and lasagna. You get some tasty fresh baked bread that you can dip in olive oil. It tasted fresh and delicious. Both meals came with either a side salad or soup. We opted for one salad with ranch (my choice!). And we shared the tortellini soup which was full of flavor. Our main dishes were great tasting and huge servings. We had to take more than half the food home.  We did opt for some lovely decaf coffees and a cake which was heavenly.  If you haven't tried it... you really should."}
{"text":"My cousin's husband is of Italian descent from Pittsburgh, he's been in metro Phoenix for decades and said it's the best Italian food he's had anywhere in the Valley, ever! We've never had a bad meal, it's always very good to excellent. The gregarious owner Frank will even have the chef whip up something special based on what you like. Great staff and service, huge portions and great food. My wife loves the (newly ubiquitous) vodka sauce, they do traditional sauces just as well. Off the beaten path and so far above the chains it's not even close."}
{"text":"Woah! Wish I knew this place was so close to my home years ago. I went for the first time a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised by the food and service. I had the pizza bread appetizer (yum-o garlic marinara cheese), tortellini soup (filling, a little too hot), and angel hair chicken Alfredo. Everything tasted great. My only complaints about the visit were soup is too hot and sports TVs are in the main dining room (creates a weird atmosphere)."}
{"text":"Good drinks, warm bread, great house salad dressing. Veal Parm and sauce on par with east coast Italian food. Pasta cooked al dente. Manicotti excellent. Very good food. Carrot cake eh, cannolis above average."}
{"text":"This old favorite has moved a little to the Soutwest and is now located in Southeast Mesa.  It is a gorgeous new building to match the wonderful food that has always been on the inside.   The service was efficient and attentive.  The food was fabulous original Italian.  The best Tortellini I have had.  Sweet marinara sauce.  Just the right spices.  Nom. Nom. Nom.  The two downsides.    1. The bar is severely lacking.  It is laid out poorly and doesn't appear \"finished\" yet.  Perhaps in the coming months it will improve, but for now I wouldn't expect pre-dinner drinks to be enjoyable.  2. The new building could be SOOOO romantic (as it looks so on the outside), but there are big screen TV's and too much light to be a romantic hide away.    Now above said this still can be a romantic get away but it is equally suitable for family dinner.  The building is a major upgrade and worth the drive."}
{"text":"My family has a real love/hate relationship with BACI.    Let me start by saying that just about everything we have EVER eaten here has been DELICIOUS!      Some of our personal favorites include the gnocci, chicken saltainboca focacia sandwhich and the bruschetta. (LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the burschetta)    HOWEVER, we have experienced some real negatives, mostly relating to staff and billing.     The first time we tried Baci we ordered take out, it was great, the staff was helpful and all was well.   We then tried to dine in the resturant, we had a 2 & a 3 yr old at the time and service was slooooooooow (but the food great as always)    I ordered the gnocci that visit and when the bill came they had charged us an extra $4 for the gnocci, we inquired (obviously) and they informed us that was their new policy for any of the 'pick your pasta' dishes, if you chose gnocci it was an extra $4.  We complained that this was neither on the menu, nor was it mentioned to us when we ordered and  I am not exagerating when I say that the waitress could not have cared less.   We asked to speak with a manager and she dissapeared for awhile, never to return to our table.   We finally had to pack up & get the kids home (about 20 min later)  we asked the hostess to get the manager and she 'couldn't find him'.  We were upset, but being very polite and simply asking to speak with someone about this.   This was a very dissapointing experience.  Another time we ordered a sandwhich and was advised she would have to add $5 to the sandwhich because it was in the'dinner hour'  it was the same, nothing was added, it wasn't bigger, but because it was 'dinner' time they would charge $5 more for the sandwhich.  when we paid the bill, however, the charge was not there, so whether she was wrong, or just forgot it, I don't know.  If you get the pasta or the 'dinner' options, it can be very pricey.  However if you get sandwhiches it's actually very reasonable price wise.  We typically get Bruschetta and 2 foccacia sandwhiches for the family and it typically totals around $21.   The portions for the sandwhiches are very generous for the price, we ALWAYS have leftovers.  FYI the Bruschetta is a fair price (as it was when we first started going here)  however in the past 18 months the order has diminished significantly.  The order used to  consist of a loaf of bread cut in half length-wise then loaded up and cut into 8 pieces.   Then it became a much smaller loaf of bread, loaded up and cut into 6 pieces, the last time we ordered it it was 5 slices of bread topped with the ingredients.   Still YUMMY, but dissapointing all the same.        We have resturant.com certificates for here, but am nervous they wont accept them since our non-food experiences have been less than wonderful.    Bottom line - great food, but be prepared for a few surprises."}
{"text":"My first question when I walked into Baci was, \"How long have you been here?\" The answer? EIGHT YEARS!! I was just stunned.  I am so sad I never knew they were here before now. I'm so happy to know about them, now!  Our family had gone to celebrate Mother's Day and my mom's birthday, courtesy of my brother.  What a treat!  It's nicely painted and holds a goodly number of people. There is a lovely water feature in the middle of the front dining room.  There are tv's for people to watch, and an assortment of booths and tables.  You can definitely bring a group or your family.  Warm fresh bread, crusty on the outside and soft inside, was served generously; there is butter, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil for the bread.  You do not need to order appetizers, but they're tasty.  Appetizer portions are small-ish but are priced low (about $7) so that you can order more than one and have a nice variety to share. We ordered the fried antipasti with three selections: zucchini, mushrooms, and cheese sticks. It came with huge portions of marinara and ranch to share.  Then the salad or soup (you choose) was served.  Salad was a nice, generous portion of mixed greens with a few crisp croutons and dressing.  I enjoyed the bleu cheese dressing with my salad.  By this time, I was feeling fairly surfeit.  And then the food came out.  These portions are easily enough for two people (and I like to EAT).   Dinners are, on average, about $13-$16. Of course it's more of you're having veal, less of its just pasta and sauce.  I had the chicken broccoli Alfredo. Huge. I got through about 1/3 of it.  Husband had lasagna and he managed half, but he feels sorry for himself now.  My sister and brother had the Pasta ala Baci; sister asked for it spicy, brother asked for extra sausage.  Mom had fettuccini Alfredo with brocolli.  Sister's 3-yr old grandchild had a child's portion of pasta with one meatball and sauce on the side (child's portion was still would have been more than I could have eaten).  Sister in Law had Tortellini Paisano in a vodka sauce that looked great.  Everyone was making \"those noises\" as they ate. So delicious.  The pasta is clearly handmade; if you've ever made your own pasta, you can absolutely tell. Firm but tender al dente, no mush. The Alfredo sauce was thick and creamy and there was plenty of it (I hate it when restaurants are chintzy with sauce!), the chicken tender and juicy, the broccoli perfectly tender-crisp.   Husband pointed out that if you don't like your food, it's your fault, because they'll literally do it any way you want. He's right.  However, after all of that, my favorite part about the restaurant was the pride evident in the staff. They like what they do. They're rightfully proud of what they're doing there.  It was a pleasure to experience. I can't wait to go back!  Next time, I'll skip eating appetizers and some of the bread, and get dessert!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian joints in all of Arizona...and I'm a half dago.  I've never had anything that wasn't very good and the service is always good.  Good meatballs, good sausage, good marinara, good wine, good beer, good food. Go there."}
{"text":"This non-chain restaurant was excellent and very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Everything tasted very fresh and homemade. We really enjoyed ourselves here. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place but it's not the Baci I remember. I was a regular diner at the old location and came a few times to the new location on Germann. It is quite a drive for us but I always thought it was worth it...until recently. The place was unusually quiet so we got great service from our server. The lasagna was always my favorite but this time I was quite disappointed. Honestly, it was worse than a tv dinner type lasagna. I'm not sure if they have a new cook or something but the whole thing tasted very sub par. The sauce tasted like it came from a can and it had a weird flavor to it. I think from now on we will stick with Olive Garden"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the Far East valley.  The tortellini soup was delicious.   The vela Marsala was very flavorful. The lasagna and stuffed shells was also very good.  We all had take hole boxes as the portions were large This is going to be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Just about on par with Olive Garden. Mozzarella in capreese was hard, minestrone had no flavor and dinner took forever to arrive. We were with a large party w 2 tables. The other table was done eating and we didn't even have our food. When it came out it was cold. Sauce started to congeal. Linguini had turned to mush.  Ambiance was nice. Waiter was nice. Others loved the food. I guess it's what you are used to and I am used to eating Italian in europe..."}
{"text":"Very good, have ate here with family and friends on many occasions.  Love their bruschetta and the service has always been good. Love how they will give the kids pizza dough to play with to keep them entertained."}
{"text":"Took the family...The portions were generous & the food was great. I recommend it, if in the area."}
{"text":"Italian girl from Indiana found her new favorite place! Service was excellent and food was Perfect. Visited with a toddler and infant and felt right at home."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great fun.  I hope they get other locations closer to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in the desert. Great service and food is 2nd too none for Italian food. It's Botha chain restaurant by any means it's family Owned and all of the family works at the Restaurant. Portions are huge."}
{"text":"As much as I like to support small local businesses I don't think I will be back anytime soon to Baci. Very few vegetarian options, it was a little pricy and the service was sssslllllooooowwww.  It might be ok for drinks at the bar but not for a family dinner, which is a bummer."}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian meals.  Large portions and very nice atmosphere.  Family run business with great service.  My go to place when I have friends from out of town visit!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was the best Italian food i have ever had.  Our server Steve was amazing.  He was very attentive despite the fact that he had several large parties he was waiting on including our party of 7.  Chef Albert is amazing.  My Veal Parmigiana was cooked to perfection.  The portions were huge.  We drove from Surprise to Mesa because of what we saw on Check Please Arizona and it was way better than expected.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Excellent job Baci!!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time on our 25th Anniversary.  After being seated then completely ignored for 20 minutes we got up and walked out.  Did not even offer water.  They were so oblivious that the two standing up front thanked us for coming in."}
{"text":"Monique was our waitress and she was very friendly and made the experience eating there that much better! The dinner started with fresh warm Italian bread and then a mixed greens salad and I really loved my lasagna dish. Celebrated a birthday that night and they sang to us with a complimentary cannoli. It was worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"We ate at Baci for the first time last night and it was terrific!  Packed on a Friday night, we were able to get a nice table for two at the bar so we sat right away.  We had Veal Scallopini, Veal Limone with two very ice cold crunchy salads and a nice bottle of wine - the food was excellent - we had great service from the very busy bar tender, and topped it off with the best tiramisu I've ever had.  We noticed many regulars greeted by name by the staff and a mix of couples and families.  It's just a very enjoyable night out and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Looking at all of the great reviews for Baci, I truly expected this place to be a diamond in the rough. My sister told me she went prior to our visit and wasn't ecstatic about the place and we should have listened. The bread was decent, the soup tasted mediocre, but the pasta was a disgrace. The four of us at the table each got a different dish from pasta with vodka sauce to the chicken parmesan. None of us were happy with our dishes and didn't even come close to finishing our plates. The server asked us if we wanted a box for the abundant amount of food we left and we said no. Our server was super nice and attentive but unfortunately her kitchen didn't help her out with quality food. There is nothing I want more than to help out local restaurants and give them great reviews but unfortunately I cannot honestly do that for Baci. Drive to San Tan and head to Carrabba's. Sorry Baci!"}
{"text":"Over the year and half BACI has gone down hill. when he was the only business in the area he could command the price and act the way they do but since other businesses moved into the area and have a  much better product and pricing BACI need to rethink customer service and their product"}
{"text":"Fantastic Family Owned Restaurant. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Awesome! Love, love, love this place! Authentic Italian food served with love by a wonderful family."}
{"text":"Large portions! Very tasty. Careful ,you will fill up on the delicious garlic bread before your meal comes out"}
{"text":"The food is great! Large portions. Delicious! My husband always wants to eat here. It's a bit of a drive but worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, slow service. We got seated at 4:30, which was early when it wasn't busy. We ordered quickly, and food was served at 5:40. All of our service was slow (water, bread, salad). Chicken parm and chicken Alfredo were excellent, and cannoli was yummy!!  Family owned and run. Owner was friendly and great. I think we just got an awkward waiter, who was actually the owner's son who let us know he was hung over from his bday the night before. Loved the location and food! Slow service and food delivery really makes me want to give it 3 stars, but the food deserves 5 stars. I've been to Italy and truly enjoyed the authentic this Italian! Definitely go to Baci, but don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to come but unfortunately the customer service has gone down. My husband ordered lasagna and I ordered the tortellini with vodka sauce which we always order. When they brought out our food they brought my husband ravioli which wasn't what he ordered. My husband at that point decided  to keep the ravioli because we were hungry and wanted to eat together but the server took it away right after he said that. Didn't even give him a chance and she walked away in a hurry with an attitude. So as I'm almost done with my dinner his lasagna came out and my husband couldn't even eat it because it was chewy and tasted as it was heated up in a microwave. Which you should be able to cut right through lasagna if it was fresh. After we said something the server had a worse attitude on her. When we were walking out I decided to ask for a manager because I was actually upset with the way we were treated especially being my favorite restaurant. The owner came up to me and I explained what happened and the owner didn't even want to listen to what I had to say. He said \"well would you believe I've been a chef for 35 years.\" That doesn't change the fact the lasagna we asked for wasn't up to par. He didn't even want to hear what I had to say all he had to say was that well this server is requested by others all the time and she wasn't in the wrong. He said that the trainee overheard my husband say ravioli and not lasagna. Well the fact is that's not what we ordered. Apparently the owners behavior isn't anything knew from what I read in the reviews. I've worked in customer service since high school and I work with patients all day long and I would have NEVER handled the way that server/owner did. I am very disappointed and we won't be back. Good customer service goes a long way. Having a big ego and not listening to customers will ruin that."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the east valley and decided to give this place a try. The food was \"good\" but not worth the price in my opinion. My dinner salad was yummy but was drowning in dressing, next time I'll ask for it on the side. I had the Tortellini Paisano and it was good, but incredibly salty (which says a lot because I actually like salt).  My husband had the Chicken Cacciatore and he seemed to like it but I had a bite of it and wasn't overly impressed with it.   The best part about the whole meal was their bread. They make it themselves and it's REALLY good. And at least we had leftovers we could enjoy the next day since the portion sizes are so large.  We walked out having spent $50 (including tip) for 2 entrées - no appetizer and no drinks.  Just a little overpriced if you asked me. I could spend less than that at a nicer restaurant in Scottsdale and would have had a more luxurious meal.  Maybe I'm spoiled, I don't know."}
{"text":"Very good food; you won't be disappointed. Although not a white table cloth restaurant, it is very clean an the staff is wonderful. Go; the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  So cute.  The food is great.  A real gem in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a little taste of Italy in queen creek. Their portions are gigantic!!! My boyfriend and I split one meal and we were both stuffed. We got the scallop linguine with scallops and it was phenomenal! Being able to choose your own sauce really diversifies the meal and left us satisfied. The meal comes with a choice of soup or salad and I would highly recommend the tortellini soup. All in all I am extremely satisfied from this establishment!"}
{"text":"I like this place for a few reasons: 1. They play oldies like Hall n Oats and Phil Collins and had TV monitors with Football! Not typical for most Italian restaurants I've been too and I like it because it doesn't feel stuffy or fake.  2. The owner is so sweet and entertaining - he came by and asked us how our meal was. His ora is pleasant and it's clear he loves what he does.    3. Um, the food is fantastic!! I got the chicken parmesan with fettucini and their Vodka sauce - it was too die for! We also had the bruschetta (Mmh!) and their bread/butter was great too (a little bit too much flour on top of the bread but not a big deal).  4. Huge portion sizes, so I took my left overs home and enjoyed it again the next day. Yum!  I am definitely a fan and hope to come back again real soon!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place from the outside. Adequate service. Food - boring and over sauced. I had their signature dish Pasta Baci - Sausage, peppers,mushrooms in a marinara sauce.  If you like heavy uninspired pasta loaded in a red sauce then this is your place.  Not a place that anyone needs to rush to."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great family restaurant with some amazing dishes with awesome portion sizes. Come hungry and make sure you save room for their tiramisu. Amazing staff. The owner walks around and chats with people. Just a great place all around."}
{"text":"Great food! Bored sons who pretend they are heir to a throne."}
{"text":"Went back again for my birthday, I was worried about them not having gluten free food but they do. I had chicken limone and it was delicious and so happy that I can enjoy a meal with my family. I would recommend you listing it on your website and menu.  Our waitress was awesome !  Have been pleased every time we go!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and consistent. The service is 5 stars. The owner is a gentleman. I am always pleased with this restaurant because the quality of the food never changes."}
{"text":"My husband and I still reserve this as our special date night and dinner place. It always astounds me to have people write reviews and then say they would rather patronize Olive Garden or Carrabas.  Just goes to show that most people have no idea what real food, especially Italian, actually tastes like.  By all means, then, stick to the basics you know...if you crave bland food, Kraft cheese, and have no idea what al dente means, you will never be happy here.  Baci is still the best in the east valley."}
{"text":"Superb! I had the pesto ravioli special (SO good), and my friends got the fried ravioli appetizer (once you try fried ravioli you'll never want to go back to traditional - consider yourself warned!), the chicken Parmesan (which was good enough to make me go slightly cross-eyed), and a sausage pizza. The bread that they serve is fresh and delicious.   The bathrooms and restaurant were clean and clutter-free, so I felt quite relaxed. I feel the best part of my meal there was the service. My glass was kept full, and the hosts and servers made sure that we were comfortable and that all of our needs were being met. Our main server, Steve, was amazing. Super friendly and helpful dude!   Our meal was brought out in well-timed courses and I loved every bite. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and the lunch specials are great the ckn pram is the best and love thier alferdo scaue is the best"}
{"text":"This is an excellent authentic Italian restaurant. I was highly impressed with the atmosphere and the quality of food. I had the lasagna with vodka sauce. Oh my goodness, it's delicious, pair with a glass of sangria red wine and there you go. I will be back to try more new things. I felt like I was at home, eating dinner with my husband. The owner made sure that we were taking care of."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this restaurant! It was packed, so we waited for about 10-15 minutes in the foyer.  The owner was socializing with everyone...those sitting at the tables and then came to the entrance and started up friendly conversation with us.  He made us feel comfortable and found us a table in the bar area where we waited until our table was ready.  We enjoyed our drinks in the Italian atmosphere and watched as he continued to float around the restaurant engaging everyone in conversation.  We started with the artichoke florentine...which was delicious and layered with flavor.  We ordered salad, pizza and pasta...everything was original and fantastic! We are looking forward to returning to this gem!"}
{"text":"Very glad I finally tried this place.  Got lost trying to find it at night but walking in to this place feels very homely, cute place.    As far as food, the bread was average...nothing special about it especially serving it with butter in packages.  I'd rather have olive oil to dip warm bread in to at an Italian joint, no butter.  My pasta dish was huge, and you get to choose the noodles you want which I like.  I think they can really benefit from having smaller portions and lowering the prices.  You get what you pay for but I literally took home two more servings of what I ordered.  After eating a piece of bread and the huge side ceaser salad which was good, I could only eat a small portion of my pasta meal.    I would defintley go back to this place two or three times a month, good place to take a date or in couples."}
{"text":"Food was really good but a little overpriced. Service was excellent! My husband and I both had lasagna and it was really good. One star taken because of price, but overall I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful restaurant the staff is fantastic and the food is very fresh and yummy. It's a very romantic place for date night as well or to come for family meal time."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's a liiiiittle pricey, but nothing to go home and cry about. It's a charming little restuarant with the nicest staff. The owner is always there and is extremely accommodating and very nice! It's clear he cares about his customers. On to the food....the bread is delicious, the portions are huge, their chocolate cake is heaven on earth and everything that I've ordered has been delicious."}
{"text":"I had there minestrone soup and it is delicious, and so is there penne arrabbiata I will defiantly recommend to my friends and family and will be coming back very soon!! Such good food and nice service :)"}
{"text":"I had high expectations on my first visit - friends said it was 'the best.'  I was surprised at the amateurish TGI Friday's feel to the menu and the atmosphere overall.  They don't have a wine list - they have two Cabernet's to choose from on the food menu which is pretty weak.  There was nothing particularly good or bad about the food.  I had pasta arrabiata which was okay, no surprises.  The veal limone was good but at almost $30 it's lacked the service and accompaniments we expected.  One thing that bothered me was how often the waitstaff talked across the restaurant to each other.  I didn't bring it up, but another person in my party did... very spotty service.    I wont hurry back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first time was a 4/5, it was wonderful. But the second time was embarrassing. I came here for my birthday and invited my family here for dinner. Half of our entree's were cold and my fathers entree had THREE bugs in it. The owner really didn't act surprised, and took my fathers entree away and my dad asked for it to be taken off the bill(needless to say, he was disgusted to have anything else from this place.)  The ambiance of this place is what really lets it get past 1 star."}
{"text":"Food was fine, service was terrible and slow.   We went last night (tuesday) for my nephews birthday. They took my name and said the wait was 30 minutes but told us we could eat at the bar if we wanted. I asked if my 17 year old nephew was allowed to eat there and she said yes, so I said OK, we'll eat back there. We found a table at the bar and it took a couple minutes to even have anyone take our drink order. She brought those and then didn't come back for a good 10 minutes, we didn't even have menus. We had to ask another server for menus. Someone, I'm assuming the manager or owner asked us to move our table ... Not to another table but he wanted to move our table to make room. Not that big of a deal, but just bad form overall.   When the server that was supposed to be taking care of us saw we had menus she came and said, are you guys eating here? At this point it had been at least 20 minutes since we sat down. I said yes, that's what I told the lady up front. She said oh, well she didn't have that marked down. I understand that maybe she just thought we were sitting there until we got our table, but she didn't ask and kept blaming the hostess. She finally came back to take our order, started to tell us the specials and couldn't even pronounce them or tell us exactly what was in them. The majority of our drink refills were done by a different server.   While waiting for our food we watched the bartender make a drink that was completely incorrect and when he couldn't get the olive out of the container with a toothpick he just used his fingers.   I ordered a thin crust pizza with spinach and pepperoni, it had great taste but it was hardly thin crust. My nephew ordered a shrimp pasta, I think it was vodka sauce with penne, and said it was good. He said the tortellini soup was really good. When we were finished our server asked us if we wanted dessert. We said no. Them she asked about 2 more times.   Overall we were at the restaurant for just over 2 hours. It only took us about half hour to actually eat our food."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype around this place it's expensive it's dirty there are roaches in there... the food is not that great I really just don't understand why these people are so in love with it I know Italian food and this Italian food is not that great"}
{"text":"This place has been our go to place for almost 15 years. Frank is great and so is the staff. And for the record, I am a \"regular\" and if I come at a busy time, I have to wait just like everyone else. No one gets ahead. The food is hearty Italian food. Anyway, the place is great."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have made many many ventures here. The owner and both of his sons are there on a regular basis. Sometimes they will just throw something together for me. This is how a restaurant should be. The food is awesome and the portions are huge. I have enjoyed many years here, and have many more to come."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars! Its so delicious!!! For the past few years I have gone here for every special occasion of mine. (Birthday, Graduation, etc) The owner is always super friendly when we walk in along with the other employees. I just love coming here. Their tortellini soup is to die for! I could seriously eat 3 bowls myself its so good! The service has always been great! I never had a bad experience with them! Thank you Bacis for bringing delicious italian food to AZ!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Baci's about 3 years.  Food is the best Italian food I have found in the east valley and they have by far the BEST pizza.  When friends come to visit from out of town we usually go to Baci's; everyone I take there raves about the food."}
{"text":"Finally I found some good Italian in the East Valley. The food was great and the portions were even better. Good atmosphere and overall good service. A must try."}
{"text":"Best eggplant parmigan I've had in forever! Wonderful good and great service. I highly recommend this restaraunt for dinner. Defiantly will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went at better time. Around 6 on a Monday.  Much less people and even better service.  I used the coupons I had gotten from that 90% off deal and they worked like a charm ... They serve you so much food, I would suggest just getting it split in two before they even bring it to you ... although I often don't do that and eat to much!! hahaha ... amazing service, amazing food and a great environment!  They even had MNF (Monday Night Football) playing on the big screens!! NICE!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  I could have eaten the bruschetta all night! Service was good and friendly. A tad bit slow but didn't mind. Very generous portions!   I would definitely go again and have recommended it to several friends!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a rare date night. It came highly recommended by several people, so we decided to give it a try. There was some slight confusion at the bar while waiting for our table. It wasn't clear whether or not there was a waiter or drinks were ordered directly from the bar. I don't remember getting the complimentary bread mentioned by other Yelpers, but in the end, that wasn't such a bad thing. We had the calamari appetizer as recommended by our server. It was delicious. Salads came with our entreees. And the portions were huge. I ordered the Clams over fettuccine with basil Pomodoro Sauce (picture posted) and my husband had the veal parmigian. I ate and ate til I couldn't eat anymore, and it didn't even look like I made a dent in the serving! I made sure to save room for their tiramasu, and was glad I did. I normally have a rule about eating seafood as leftovets, but it was still delicious the next day! The service was great. Other than the bar confusion, good experience. They have a pretty extensive menu, so I look forward to going back and trying more."}
{"text":"We went here quite some time ago because they were on restaurant.com and we had purchased a gift card there.  We got a supreme pizza thin crust.  It was awesome!  We loved how all the ingredients were obviously fresh and not canned.  Since we don't get out much because of young children, it took us a long time to get back here.  We went by last night to pick up some pizza, and this time got the thick crust.  While not as good as the thinner crust, it was still awesome.  The staff has been super friendly both times and very knowledgeable about their menu.  We will definitely be back more often!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking restaurant.  Went at a busy time but we were able to find a table in the bar instead of waiting for an hour.  Highly recommend reservations!  Our server was great and the food was outstanding!  Huge portion sizes, easily enough for another meal the next day.  Antipasti plate appetizer was very generous. Will definitely make this a regular stop when in town."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the ambience, service and quality of food. Although we didn't understand most of the Italian words what we did order was tasty."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars for me but I'll give the extra half star because it was a descent meal. The floor plan of this place is ridiculous. The waiting room is tiny, and the wait was close to an hour, so we sat outside. They said we could wait in the 'bar' which is just a couple of hi-top tables next to a serving counter. I walked right past it like \"is this what they're calling a bar?\" And there was no seating left. Once we got our table, the atmosphere was nice though, and the meal was acceptable. We split the spinach gnocchi Alfredo which was pretty good but not great. The real winner was the chocolate tiramisu. It is pretty awesome. And with a couple of drinks thrown in our bill was under $40. Overall I would say pretty good and I will try this place again."}
{"text":"This place was truly delish.  The staff was super friendly and on top of their game with taking care of their tables.  Our entire family enjoyed their dish and we all are excited to go back soon.  This place does seem to be in an odd location however it is worth the drive if u want really good Italian food..."}
{"text":"Baci is another whole in the wall restaurant that's hidden, and deserves all the recognition that it can get. The owner (Whose actually Italian, Frank) greets everyone and makes you feel right at home. I went with 2 of my other friends, so I got to try a little of everything. The bread that comes with the meal is very good, but the garlic cheese bread that's $3.99 is very good as well. Everything is homemade, including all of the sauces. I had the Lasagna, while my friends had other pasta dishes. We were all very pleased, and full. The portions are huge! I would definitely recommend Baci as your breakaway from the chains, and for something a little more intimate."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of our favorites.  The owner (Frank) and his servers are attentive and the food is outstanding.  The portions are super large and always fabulous the next day.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and would consider them the best Italian in the Phoenix area.  My favorite meal is their Chicken Parmesan and anything with Vodka sauce!"}
{"text":"open & closed odd hours/days, wasted a drive over cuz WHO'S CLOSED ON MONDAYS?! when we finally did get to try this place it WASN'T worth the wait. unmemorable food, service was slow, def wouldnt waste a trip there again."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food west of your nana's kitchen. The service is friendly and efficient, the owner is real old school Italian. The portions are huge. I don't know what's better eating it in the restaurant or leftovers the next day."}
{"text":"Baci is more of an upscale Italian food restaurant. It is a family restaurant. Everyone there is very friendly and provide good service. I would say dress at least business casual here because it is a nicer restaurant.  The food is really high quality and you do pay the price for that. The environment is very quaint and it is a great place to take a date. There are TVs all over the place so you don't miss the game which is nice.  I highly recommend Baci."}
{"text":"I have lived in Queen Creek for a year and a half and have never noticed this restaurant. I never turn down the road that it is on, but drive past it every day. Wanting something Italian and learning Nick & Vito's closed, I remembered seeing a sign on Ellsworth point toward the restaurant. It was surprisingly close.  The first thing I noticed (other than the door slamming in the strong winds) was the size of the restaurant. Very large with a nice bar area, multiple televisions and a nice big glass window. Our server was prompt and stopped by frequently. He kept the drinks filled and ensured we had everything we need. The deco was nice too - a nice marble textured wall with some posters/paintings on display. I heard Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin lowly through the overhead speakers.  I was distracted in looking at the menu because I was trying to locate Yelp reviews on my phone to see what was good. The waiter had already stopped by twice allowing extra time and I still wasn't sure, so I just ordered fettuccini alfredo. My friend ordered basically the same thing plus chicken & broccoli. Both dishes came with salad. I have to say the bread was excellent. I know, kind of weird getting excited over bread, but that with the oil. Nice!  The portions were huge - I came away with a big take out box. Not bad for $10.95. Guess who's got lunch?  Overall the fettuccini was fine. It wasn't the best I have had, but it was good. The sauce was not too thick, not too runny. It was a good dining experience and a good, close option for Italian food in the Queen Creek area."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh. The chicken parmigiana was amazing. Bruschetta was made  with fresh mozzarella which is rare these days. The alfredo sauce was okay but not great, a tad unseasoned and a bit watery, which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Our waitress was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best Italian restaurants I haven eaten at. The staff is friendly and we were seated very quickly. The proportions were extremely generous. The bruschetta was some of the best! Stop in, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing that queen creek lacks, it is good Italian food.  Baci gave my new wife and I some amazingly well prepared food.  We are very picky about our Italian food, my wife grew up in Rome, NY and still raves about Teddy's chicken ridges (a local Upstate favorite).  I must say that after eating at Baci, we are done searching for good Italian in the valley, it is right down the road!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food... The owner and son make the service friendly and great for families or a couples night out...  My favorite is veal parm & wife loves about 10 different meals!!  Must go!!"}
{"text":"If your ever out in Queen Creek check this place out. Awesome food & HUGE portions of the pasta."}
{"text":"We just keep coming back for the excellent food and service here. I took a party of 30 (reservation was made) and everything went off without a hitch!  Can't be happier with this place!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This Italian place is the best I have ever had.  If your looking for nice atmosphere and great food try it out.  Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good italian restaurant.  Food was outstanding - I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was terrific.  Perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  We went there on a busy Friday night and the service was excellent.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely wonderful about our first visit.  Great service, excellent, fresh, homemade food!  I couldn't be more pleased.  We had the lentil soup, chicken parm and lasagna.  All were delicious.  Our server was very helpful and attentive.  Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian food in Arizona. Coming from Chicago where Italian food is fantastic. The owner is from South suburbs  has an awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Baci is a local favorite. Convenient to go ordering and always a pleasant experience dining in. The food is consistent and always good. Great for families although I suggest ordering fewer entrees than people in your party. Portions are large."}
{"text":"It is a drive to get to but the food is worth the drive.  Very nice decor and attentive staff. Prices were not unreasonable but could have been a tad less for better value. Lots of pasta choices and plentiful servings, I like a place that offers two kinds of garlic bread, with or without cheese. I was disappointed in the meatballs, definently have had better and at $2.50 a meatball they were not worth the money. Overall a good place to go if you are heading down towards Queen Creek."}
{"text":"You will enjoy the food and service at his great place. The owner will personally greet you and make sure your visit is enjoyable. A gem !"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good Italian place this is it! Forget Olive Garden and come here. Not only has every encounter with the staff been great as they are all extremely nice but the food is awesome! Some plates are large enough for two to share and if you don't share you'll most likely bring home left overs, the tortellini soup is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service. If you want quality Italian food, Baci's is the place to eat. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but everything I have tried I really like. In stead if doing the typical Friday night pizza delivery, I recommend ordering a pizza for pickup from Baci's."}
{"text":"The owner Frank is terrible he argued with me about a coupon I had and wouldn't use it. He yelled at me in front of the entire restaurant. The waitress was great!  Will NEVER return there again!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The service, food, and atmosphere are great. Everything we have tried has been delightful. Our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food and ambiance,  but they only take reservations for a party of 6 or more. The owner allows his friends to be seated before everyone else whether you have a reservation or not. So don't get excited if there is one party ahead of you."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and am yet to be disappointed. The appetizers, pizza, and pastas are authentic and full of flavor. Baci's offers great service, great menu, awesome food, and a nice environment to eat in."}
{"text":"Really good food, at a great value. I've seen the owner just about every time I've been. That's a sign of a great place to me. The portions are rather large so it's a good place to go for yummy leftovers."}
{"text":"I ordered several trays for Christmas Eve dinner and I was not disappointed. The lasagna was one of the best I have had. All of my guests raved about our meal. I would definitely order for events in the future."}
{"text":"The reason for my 3 star review is service. The food is as good as many Italian restaurants, although the sauces were a bit heavier on the oils than other places we've dined. The servers, however, could use better training in my opinion.   When we arrived, we were greeted by a couple of young people, then seated by a young man. The 3 or 4 \"kids\" tending the entrance seemed a bit unorganized but the four of us in our party were seated promptly.  The problem I have is that I made an extra effort to walk back to the sign up desk after I was seated to let them know that I wished for the check to be given to myself at the end of our dinner because I didn't want to haggle with the other couple over the bill. I wanted to pay because it was the 71st birthday of my friend.   I made this request clear to the several staff members including the young man that seated us. Unfortunately our server was not informed. At the end of our dinner she presented the check to the center of the table as if it was up for grabs! Sure enough, this ensued in what was my deepest dread - a huge deliberation of who was going to pay for what...ugh. What a mess. What an embarrassing situation that need not to have happen if my simple request had been honored.   The server apologized when I said something but did make light of it, as if it was not really a big deal. Yeah.....sorry, from me. It was a big deal."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Italian restaurant for miles!!!!! I am never disappointed and I'm from New York!!!!  Frank the owner is so friendly and the food is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever.   We wasted our entire evening there after being trapped for two hours! Food was mediocre and expensive. The staff was friendly enough, but the slow service ruined everything for us."}
{"text":"What is amazing is the portions. Reasonable prices and any normal person will get at least two meals out of any given entree.   Quality ingredients makes pretty delicious food. Good sauces with perfectly cooked pasta. I would come back any time. Owner is a great guy."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight. We were not too happy with the wait ( 1 hour), pizza was bland and too much cheese. Service was average. We will not be revisiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"The people who know better order take-out on a Friday night.  If you value your time do likewise.  For as good as the food is, it's a shame the service was so sub-par.  We arrived 5-10 minutes before our 7 p.m. reservation for a party of 7 (including 1 kid) and were not seated until almost 7:45 p.m.  At our table we saw our server once for drink orders and then had to flag her down to order our entrees and then throughout our entire visit for any additional service.  Another server dropped the bread off at our table right in front of my 2 year old niece with the knife in arm's reach and she reached right for it.  When I told the server she needed to be more aware of things like her only response was \"Oh\" and she walked away.  Note to the manager: with a restaurant as busy as this place can get on a weekend night do your patrons a favor and staff up with extra servers - your staff are apparently too overwhelmed to pay attention to the details.  I'd give you 4 stars for the food, but 0 stars for the service."}
{"text":"This resteraunt has a great atmosphere which is paired excellently with their great Italian. Always love to come to Bacis every time we're in town. Large portions of delicious pasta with homemade sauce. Would recommend the chicken parmigiana and the manicotti but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Baci's is hands down the best, most authentic, Italian food I have had since moving to Arizona 14 years ago.    I come from an Italian family and have more than my fair share of pasta and sauce and bread and cheese under my belt, if you know what I mean.  If I'm eating Italian food that I didn't cook myself, it had better be from Baci's.  I have tried several different menu items and all have been fantastic, but each time I'm hard pressed not to order the Tortelloni Paisano.  It's loaded with their amazingly rich vodka cream sauce, prosciutto, mushrooms, and peas, and it's enough for 2 meals.  The main drawback with this dish is I can't stop eating it and leave the restaurant completely stuffed.  Their marinara sauce is sweet and just a little spicy, order it with any pasta or ask for a side to go with the fresh crusty bread.  We take a bowl of it home with us and I spend the next few days looking for things to put it on.  The salads are fresh and delicious.  I can't say I've tried much from the dessert menu because in the unlikely event that I'm still hungry I'll just eat more bread.  The owner, Frank, is always out chatting with customers and making sure we're having a good time.  Our kids love coming here because he will give them a little ball of pizza dough and once even gave them a tour of the kitchen.  Baci's is my go-to place for a birthday or special occasion dinner.  The decor is somewhere between a fine-dining establishment and a sports bar, classy enough but unassuming.  I have always had good service so I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about.  I'm sure things get busy especially on a Friday or Saturday night but all those people are there for a reason and that is fantastic food.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic mom and pop Italian food with friendly, casual service.  Everything I've ever had is great and no matter what you get you'll have plenty left over for lunch the next day.    The marinara is rich with a fresh tomato and garlic flavor.  The meatballs are perfectly seasoned and tender the pasta is always cooked al dente and the fresh bread is a perfect compliment to the meal - just don't eat too much before your dish arrives.  I definitely recommend the portabello steak pasta, stuffed shells and any of the sandwiches during lunch time.    Make sure you don't miss the cannoli for dessert - creamy, slightly sweet with a crunchy shell.  And my one pet peeve on cannoli is when the restaurant drowns then in fake-tasting, Hershey chocolate sauce - they don't do that here.  It's perfect!"}
{"text":"If I had the option to rate lower I would. The service was decent but the food is bland and inconsistent. My husband and I ate here a few years ago and I swore I would never return after ordering a glass of wine not realizing it was going to come with a loogy, reluctantly I was convinced by my husband and father in law to give it another try. FAIL.....  The first order of bread we got was day old stale bread, my father in law order another and it was straight from the warmer- inconsistent.  As for the food, the pasta was over sauced and blan. The pizza was overly doughy and taste like cardboard.  BLAND BLAND BLAND.... I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will NEVER be convinced to go back."}
{"text":"Baci's  is a great Italian restaurant with a friendly atmosphere,  relaxed eating and the best marinara in the valley. Our favorite appetizer is the pizza bread, standard go to is eggplant parmigiano and lasagna and we always have food for the next day."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Have been avoiding going to this place because I have heard some bad reviews from friends. Overall I was satisfied with my experience. I did end up getting dirty silverware, but the waitress was quick to correct the situation. Portions are huge. Would recommend splitting entrees unless you are a big eater. Will come back again."}
{"text":"It was ok. If you're from the East Coast you won't be super impressed but it's good all around Italian.   The pizza is not good.  The pasta is def al dente and most of the sauces were slighty lacking in flavor. Think a place that has a lot of elderly who are watching their sodium intake.  Good for the most part. The owner didn't say 2 words to us so can't really speak much about him."}
{"text":"So excellent! The Bruchizza pizza is fabulous! Everything is a large portion. Beautiful place and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they were on the corner of Power and Williams Field. Baci's is by far the most authentic Italian experience you can get in the east valley from the food to the family atmosphere. The portions are large and you usually always need a container togo. My personal favorite is the veal parmesan. Although the new location is a little out of the way, it's definitely worth checking out. Good for date night or family dinners!"}
{"text":"We got gift cards to this place a while ago and finally decided to check them out.  First go was a dud. Stupid us went on a Saturday night around 6:30pm or 7pm and it was PACKED, literally like sardines in the tiny waiting space inside. Having a 2 month old and an 18 month old wasn't a good idea, it was over an hour wait so we decided to just go home.  Second time we were smarter and went around 5pm and only waited about 15 minutes and we were the only ones waiting, much better!  That aside the food really is good. The owner is great too as he was always going around talking to people. He even talked to our son a couple times trying to get him to smile and laugh.  Prices may seem a bit steep at first but the portions are really big, even the kid meals.  Overall a good experience, still have some money left over and we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a very popular dining establishment! Family owned takes you back to Old Chicago. Always a waiting time. Food is definitely just like the good ole Italian style.  Bread is good,  service it's good! So what's a matter with you get your b. .t in gear & come on by for some good eats! This started out as a great review, HOWEVER we were told a 1 hr wait turned into 1hour & 50 min. Not happy with that :("}
{"text":"Excellent! Have never been disappointed! Enjoy a bottle of wine as well, and do not part up dessert!"}
{"text":"Good food, selection choices and friendly staff with fair pricing.  The owner is almost always present and normally stops by your table to greet you and thank you for coming in.   The wait times can get long during peak hours and there isn't a lot of room for waiting."}
{"text":"Went to Baci for an early dinner and tried out the summer menu. Not dissapointed. Again the food was tremendous and waitress attentive."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed! This place charges high prices for low quality food. We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer and right when it arrived I knew this place wasn't going to be good.  An Italian joint should have their calamari down to a perfection, this place not so much. Out came a small platter with about 7 rings of calamari that was completely flavorless and chewy.  The salads were alright, except for the few brown and wilted greens.  I ordered the linguine with clams, and it was mediocre. My friend ordered the orange roughy (fish) and it totally tasted like it was previously frozen. If your a fish eater you will instantly know that their fish isn't fresh when you bite into it.  It was very bland and had a watery texture to it like it was just thawed out and cooked. If your going to charge $25 for the fish entree you dayum well better be serving FRESH fish. I don't recommend this place to anyone and the only people that would actually like this place have really bad taste in food. The other people on here who wrote good reviews obviously have BAD taste in food."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with plenty of seating in dining area.  Didn't have too long of a wait on a week night, maybe 15 minutes but it was worth the home cooked Italian dinner.  Our server was very friendly and recommended dessert which was cheesecake and delicious!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious food, expert service and fair pricing, pop in to Baci's in Queen Creek. Frank and his staff will do everything possible to make certain your first time in will not be your last. We bring all our out-of-town company to Baci's and they all love it. Family favorites are the deep fried calzone, bruschetta, chicken parmesan, cannoli, and spaghetti and meatballs. Plan to wait on a Friday/Saturday and have a drink in the bar or newly-remodeled patio area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I love the chicken limone, their minestrone soup and the starter bread! Mmm fantastic. The inside is beautiful and the staff are great! Only negative I can say is the dessert menu isn't great. But I love it anyway."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT!!! This is the worst restaurant experience of my life. I wouldn't leave any stars if I had a choice. My friend and I stopped in to try something new. I ordered the Chicken Parm, and didn't like my meal, after 3 bites, because of personal preference. When I notified the server, she very politely took the meal, asked if I wanted to speak with a manager, to which I replied \"no thank you, I'm not angry, I just didn't like it\". She removed the meal from the check and then comes over with our ticket, and I thanked her. Immediately the owner, Frank, comes over to rudely tell me that \"the Chicken Parm is a top seller, he had four people eating what I didn't want, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it\". He also then said very rudely, \"That was not nice of you to send back food that had nothing wrong with it; how often do you to this at restaurants?!\" I'm guessing that he was implying that I did this quite often, and I then replied, \"I don't do this often at all, but it shouldn't matter. I didn't say there was anything wrong with the food, it was just a personal preference that I didn't like it.\" The server comes back, to find out how rude the owner Frank had been, and profusely apologizes for him. Frank then returned to continue harassing me, and continued to do so after my repeated attempts at asking him to not talk to me and to leave me alone. Frank had the audacity to tell me that he owned the restaurant, and he didn't have to leave or go anywhere he didn't want to - until I was in tears begging him to leave me alone and not talk to me. This was the most unfriendly and rude person I've ever had the misfortune to cross paths with - do not eat at this restaurant, and don't you ever dare to tell Frank that you don't like his food."}
{"text":"We used to love Baci's, it was our special occasion destination. The last few visits were very disappointing. DO NOT attempt to go on any holiday, waited nearly 2 hours on Mothers Day for a table for 4. Our service on that trip was terrible, the waitress brought us a loaf of bread that was still frozen on the inside. We asked for a different loaf, no one was upset with her-just told her it was still frozen and could we get a cooked loaf...she kinda copped an attitude with us (like we froze the damn bread!) after that and made sure that we knew that she was doing us a favor by waiting on us. That visit was the last straw for me.  I don't need to pay that kind of money to be treated like crap by the young punky wait staff. Prior to that visit we went as a party of 10 and also had bad service, not hostile just obviously inexperienced, communication issue or maybe just overwhelmed by a large party. It will be a long time before I go back.  I liked Baci's better at their old location..."}
{"text":"Here for my daughters 12th birthday! Great atmosphere and food!  The gnocchi is amazing!  It's out of the way but worth the drive. Try the steak and seafood!!"}
{"text":"Baci's has the best italian food around. It is always super fresh and has wonderful flavor. I have enjoyed everything that I have tried. The food does take a little longer to come out than at a lot of places but that is only because they are cooking it fresh to order for you."}
{"text":"Arrived as two couples on a Friday night.  The restaurant came recommended by one of the couples.  We were seated promptly and our drink orders taken.  The server was friendly, polite and knowledgeable about the food choices.  After taking our order a plate of bread was placed on the table.  The bread was good but not the best I've been served.  We were given butter - no oil spice plate was offered.  The food arrived in short order and everyone was happy with the taste.  The portion size was on the large size and could be split and still have a decent meal.  AND THEN twice during our meal we were interrupted by staff singing Happy Birthday.  I don't know about you but this is so annoying.  I purposely avoid places that practice singing Happy Birthday.   It would be so easy to just give the Birthday person a piece of cake with a candle and just say Happy Birthday.  There is NO NEED to sing it loudly annoying everyone else in the restaurant.  The food and service were very good but because of the singing it reduced my rating of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian Bistro!  Excellent service, the food is fantastic, and the owner walks from table to table greeting guests.  I've eaten here multiple times over the past five or six years.  It's a little gem in Queen Creek.  We had a family dinner celebration for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary.  They set us a nice table at the back of the restaurant.  We were allowed to bring a cake (which they served for us) and champagne.  The staff made the celebration extra special.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in the East Valley."}
{"text":"After a week of training, Friday is special because it is Baci.   Pizza Day. Always a favorite. Many choices brought in as takeout with a large salad. Pizzas are fresh,  lots of meats or veggies, flavorful herbs and cheeses.  Family owned restaurant. I can't speak to the wait times, other Itallian food,  or dine in service...but never any issues with pizza take out. Used to dine in at old location. Always one of my favorite East Valley locations for pizza."}
{"text":"Does anyone in AZ know what real Italian food is? Ordered chicken versuivo. It was smothered in onions and the chicken was as bland and dry as the service was. The waitress asked if we where done with it, as we only took about 3 bites of it before we could not eat anymore. Waitress asked if we wanted to take it home and we stated no. Would that not be a clue that we did not like it? She never asked if there was something wrong with it, thus one star less. The building and deco is nice."}
{"text":"Frank and the staff at Baci Italian Bistro are simply amazing. We come weekly for our Network Group and they are so tentative and provide an amazing assortment of dishes. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. Service is slow. Our most recent visit was on a Monday evening. Although there were only four tables occupied, it took the three people at the counter a few minutes to figure out where to seat our party of three.   The first time we went we shared the bruschetta appetizer which was lack luster. My husband had the calzone which he enjoyed very much and I what is basically capellini pomodoro although they called it something else. My pasta was very good but a bit pricey at $16.95 for cappellini, tomato, basil & garlic.   During our second visit, I ordered the Caprese salad which was $8.95. Imagine my surprise when what appeared on my table was the bruschetta topping from last time with a few slices of mozzarella cheese on top. the tomatoes were soggy and swimming in liquid. Our daughter ordered the kids spaghetti, no meatball. Her spaghetti arrived with a giant meatball on top, this was probably done to add some flavor as her spaghetti sauce had no flavor or spices, it was basically tomato sauce. My husband had the calzone again and liked it.   I am not generally a fan chains, but I would definitely pick the Olive Garden up the street over Baci."}
{"text":"This is a place that really shines.  It is as good as the one that I got in Rome, Milano, NYC, and San Francisco and it was very delightful.   It is very rare that that East Valley have something in this caliber that offered varieties of choices of sauces, pastas, along with extremely reasonable prices.  The bread was handmade, the pasta were cooked perfectly and the taste of pure butter sauce was just heavenly.   It was probably one of the best tasting meal that I've had for a long time.  EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Baci's for 16 years. Frank is always welcoming, concerned with his customers experience and the food is always great! If you don't see it on the menu Frank will go to the kitchen and have his staff make it your way! New patio is beautiful and can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy a nice dinner. Bread is awesome! Don't fill up on it as the portions are incredible. If you are looking for great quality and family owned experience, this is the place."}
{"text":"Food is real good and the environment is cool. The only concern I had was the wait time.  We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Those 4 & 5 star ratings are a joke!  The best thing was the bread -- but that came with  little butters in small containers rather than fresh butter pads.  Then the minestrone soup was a bowl of thick tomato sauce and salt! Sent it back and asked for the lentil soup to go (my husband got that and it was pretty good). I ordered lemon veal with artichokes and he ordered shrimp pasta with Alfredo sauce. The veal wasn't too bad, but came drenched in sauce and canned artichoke quarters around the plate...you couldn't cook it with the veal??? The shrimp my husband got was certainly \"cooked, frozen shrimp\" then put on top of the pasta!!! No Joke! They charged about $20 for each meal which was the quality of a $8.00 meal.   Waitress was really good but a short, heavy-set guy was reprimanding her right in front of the kitchen door (on the dining room side) right where everyone could hear and it went on for several minutes... Couldn't believe it -- but she came back as nice as before and professional.   Brandy S. you can get a job in a better place than that!  You were better than any food we got..."}
{"text":"Great pasta, friendly staff, decent atmosphere...but REALLY slow service. Don't go if you're in a hurry. And if you go on a Friday or Saturday evening, call ahead because they get quite busy."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. The food is always good. But more than that, I really love the service. To be completely honest, the last time we were there it was excruciatingly slow. BUT, the owner came out and talked with us. The waiter brought dough balls for the kids to shape and play with. We weren't bored and no one got upset while waiting. Then, like I said the food was delicious. I had the special, it was a sausage and mushroom pasta, which I ate half of and took the rest home. The kids had the Baci version of Mac&Cheese, my dad ordered the calamari, (which my kids promptly ate for him) and a seafood dish. I feel like it's really great, authentic, Italian food that the whole family can love. We also ordered some cannoli and I learned that they have regular and mini size cannoli. Baci's is a good one, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were very impressed  with Baci.  The food was excellent, I had the Clam l linguine and my husband had the lasagna.  The sauce was superb and the pasta perfect.  Took a little bit to get dinner but the result where spot on. Highly recommend for great Italian food"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this hidden gem in Mesa by Queen Creek. Sue had the baked penne in vodka sauce. WOW!!!!  I had Veal Marsala..... the bread is fresh, the atmosphere is amazing. Our waitress Daniela was great! The whole staff was friendly and it feels like home. Make sure your hungry when you stop in.   I can say we have a new favorite place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite italian restaurant in Phoenix by far!  My favorite dish is the capricosa dish.  I've never seen that dish served anywhere else.  I typically order it with Chicken and Shrimp but sirloin and shrimp is also great.  I love small family owned places like this.  Even though I love how nice their new place is, I kinda miss the hole in the wall feel their old place had.  The owner is super cool.  He even made me a dish once per request that wasn't on the menu.  I got back from a trip from Italy and asked if he knew how to make some of these dishes.  If you ask the owner and eat in, they will make things that are non menu items.  Another favorite of mine is the Lasagna.  Its so good that I normally don't eat lasagna at all but I do theirs.  That's how good it is.  I think the only thing I ate there where I wasn't super impressed was their pizza.  I haven't had it in years and it was just once but it was okay.  Everything else though is amazing!"}
{"text":"First visit, and it is now one of my top restaurants for food and only choice for Italian.  Great service and even better food.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! If you weren't specifically looking it you might miss it. Trust me, stop on in, you won't be sorry!  First impression is a friendly staff greeting you at the door of a clean, nicely decorated little restaurant. Followed by an excellent menu variety, fair prices, delicious food and topped off with incredible customer service. My drink never reached half empty and the attention to delight was consistent throughout my visit. Chloe was our server and she's simply a sweetheart!  I will definitely be making the detour off the main roads to go here over other Italian choices in the area. I recommend that others do the same."}
