{"text":"Had breakfast tea at casa imperial this morning, the dim sums was actually impeccable, white tuna an bacon tart, bird tart tart and BBQ pork are on my favorite list right now. But the congee is way too over-priced."}

{"text":"My family and I came here to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday. Casa Imperial was the perfect choice. It is a very elegant restaurant inside a beautiful Victorian mansion. I was pleasantly surprised as I took a step inside...

My brother made a reservation during the week and we were given a table upstairs. With my grandpa a couple steps behind, I quickly noticed the number of stairs inside the restaurant. It is not really senior-friendly, especially with the washrooms located in the basement level (there was a strong odour there too). There is a dining area on the main floor but there was an oddly quiet wedding party going on.

The ambiance, full service and table setting truly made it a fine dining experience. The only problem I had was the children running around. I was surprised the parents let them and the manager never said a word to them.

My brother called in ahead of time and they prepared a set dinner for us. It included the following:

- Barbecue suckling pig with jellyfish (The skin was crispy and the meat was not too salty)
- Sautéed scallops and prawn with salted egg yolk in a crispy nest (All of us enjoyed the deep-fried prawn because the batter had salted egg yolk and we have never tried anything like it. It reminded us of moon cake with egg yolk! Yum...)
- Braised shark fin soup with fresh crab meat (Sorry but we did have shark fin soup. The shark fin pieces were surprisingly long and thick, and the soup was tasty, not fishy at all)
- Braised whole abalone with vegetable (I found the sauce to be a bit too salty but the abalone was nicely cooked)
- Deep-fried crispy squabs (These were very flavourful, moist and tender)
- Sautéed snow pea leaves with assorted mushrooms (Nothing special but we love mushrooms)
- Poached lobster with supreme stock (We usually don't order lobster but this was pretty tasty - it must have been the \"supreme\" stock ;) - and the lobster was cooked perfectly)
- Steamed green bass (We also love steamed fish, so as long as it is fresh and does not taste fishy, we'll take it!)
- Braised e-fu noodles (E-fu noodle is our favourite kind of noodles. It was a nice, light ending before desserts)

Especially for a milestone birthday, ordering Chinese birthday buns (??) is a must! The buns were not the prettiest but they were soft and the lotus paste filling was not too sweet. The egg yolk inside each bun really made it seem like we were eating mooncakes except it was bread.

Overall, it was a fairly grand experience. I loved the decor inside and out, the food was mostly good, and the service is decent. I did not pay the bill but I know it was pricey. But it's nice to splurge a little and enjoy an amazing meal for someone's milestone birthday!"}
{"text":"Good news:  some of the best dim sum our group has ever eaten. 
Bad news: with their quirky unreliable reservation process you could end up waiting an hour (or more) to get seated.

The decor is Old English Country Manor, with each room (main, upstairs) packed in with dinner tables. 

Arrive early, be patient. Final bill was much higher than most dim sum places, but we didn't begrudge it because of the high quality of the food and service.

You can get there reasonably easily by transit; there are a limited number of parking spots."}
{"text":"Elegant place with mediocre food.  Lots of bling while the servers treat you as if they really wished you'd gone somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"The har gao we ordered had a full fly (legs, eyes and body) cooked in it. The moment we told the server he took the dish and ran away with it and we didn't have the chance to take a picture. It was a nauseating experience.  

We made reservations for 11am and sat down at 12pm after standing and waiting in crowded area being pushed around by several other families. 

Rude service. They hit us with their trays walking by and spilt everywhere. One of us got hit in the head with a tray without an apology. They didn't take away dishes that were done. We had to put them on the floor to make room for food. 

Additional to that, they would only give us 10% off. The city should schedule a health inspection at this restaurant. 

Overall, the service and food was completely unacceptable and I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save yourself the time, money, and experience and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had dim sum today. Place is very nice and clean. Dim sum was really good. Defiantly coming back to try lunch and dinner menu"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Definitely not your typical dim sum.  Even the most common dishes are amazing.  Worth the usual long wait."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of years back. The place is classy, friendly and service as far as I can remembered was grrreat! A must for anyone into fine, authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, from the outside to the inside. Everything taste so good! Every dish has a spin on traditional dim sum. Make sure to try the har gow, definitely the best I've had! 

Sometimes the wait is a little long, which is to be expected, and a little on the pricier side for dim sum, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Restaurant looks nice but service was horrible. Worm was found in the vegetable dish and when it was pointed out to the waitress, she said it was impossible and tried to get rid of the worm. Unfortunately for her, the worm was on a chopstick and flew on the table when she tried to get it away. At that point they took the dish away without an apology from the waitress or the manager. At this point, the other dishes were almost finished and the rice had not arrived. We cancelled the rice and they told us the manager put the order in and we could not cancel despite the fact that there was no more food on the table. After we insisted on cancelling the rice, the waitress finally agreed. At that time the rice came and the waitress told the person we cancelled and then she proceeded to make a fuss because she had already brought the rice up. This has been the worst restaurant experience that I have had. They have the rudest manager and workers."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. This was a last minute birthday dinner decision that worked out very well :) we were there on a Saturday evening and reservations were not needed. This may not be the case always but we were very pleasantly surprised. Food is fresh and very good. Service was super. 
The restaurant is located in a beautiful historical mansion. 
We had the cream of corn with chicken soup, and the roasted duck, with more dishes I can't recall at the moment. All were very good! 
For a group of 6, dinner worked out to be about $36 per person. Expected it to cost more! 
We enjoyed it very much and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has 4 stars. 

First of all, it's by far one of the tackiest places I've been to period. Fake French maid outfits for waitresses, ugly red/gold glass lazy susan and gold in all the wrong places. It's as if this was a Old Man's club house with whiskey and cigars and one day they ordered Chinese take out and decided they could make the food better. While keeping all the existing decor but added gold \"double happiness\" everywhere. I'm thinking French and Chinese z-list designers got together while drunk and puked out digested chow mein and escargot which became the centre piece for each table. 

That brings me to my other point - the food is the quintessential definition of O.K. I could have driven a block up Warden and got much better dim sum. 

My last point is the service. I had 3 items ordered that didn't come; the pigeon, the dou Miao and bean curd roles. They still charged us for them with attitude when we disputed. 

Seriously, I don't understand what the hype about this is."}
{"text":"I went to their restaurant as part of a wedding celebration. I have to say, for the most part the wedding menu was average and overrated. 

The food was certainly not worth the price tag. Yet a lot of Chinese people I know love to frequent this place for dim sum. 

While the foods had amazing sounding foods on the menu (which is normal), the actual food itself was a let down. The food tasted ok.

As other people have pointed out, the devote is lovely and transports you back to a different era. 

The staff: fairly friendly but not as helpful or quick to provide you with utensils and drinks. 

Now onto the food! I'm not going to bother to translate the fancy food names. 

Suckling pig: tasted delicious and had nice crispy crunch on the outside and tender meat underneath. The flashing lights on the suckling pig was tacky

The wine infused conch: heavy on the curry but tasted yummy, whatever it is. Looks pretty in pictures though.

Seafood Oyster Mushroom: decent presentation and tasted ok, a little heavy on the sauce 

Crabmeat Fin Soup: very salty but tasted pretty good. Lots of ingredients of the crabmeat and fin

Abalone: very salty sauce. Reasonable size abalone and mushroom. The bean sprouts veggies were very tender and delicious 

Pigeon: little tough to separate the bone and the meat. Fairly well seasoned

Fish: pretty presentation. Too heavy on the soy sauce though. Otherwise the fish was very tender

Lobster: typically done lobster at Asian restaurant. Well seasoned and tender 

Chinese sausage sticky rice: sorry but this reeks of cheapness. No colour to spruce up the dish, and was very salty since it was mostly Chinese sausages, dried shrimp and mushrooms. 

Ei Fu Noodles: not outstanding in terms of appearance. Tastes delicious though. You can really taste the cooking wine in the mushrooms 

Dessert: we had the lychee like jello with some goji berries and bites of lychee in it. Tastes vey light and was different than typical Chinese desserts. And the other dessert is traditional red bean soup. Tastes delicious but just like most Chinese restaurants. 

Overall, I would not recommend hosting a wedding banquet here. I'm sure for the price tag, it is better spent elsewhere with more delicious tasting foods that also look amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible. We waited for an hour for dim sum! And we had reservation!! The food is OK, slightly better than other dim sum place, I wouldn't say it's worth the wait.  Do avoid weekends, unless you are OK with hour long waits."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. First of all, the parking is an absolute nightmare. Not enough spaces. Secondly, the hostess is tricky. She tells you that there is not much wait. Then she makes you more than a half hour while letting in their regular customers in front of you. Looks like you need to be a frequent customer to be respected. Finally, the food wasn't that great for having gone through all that aggravation. Price was expensive too. It was a dim sum experience from hell. Avoid like the plague!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for anyone who craves for great Chinese dim sum.  They have put in their own spin in many routine dim sum dishes.  The changes didn't distract the original taste, rather enhancing it.

You have to try their jumbo shrimp dumplings, milk tart with swallow's nest, milk and mango puff, sticky rice, spare ribs...etc."}
{"text":"Outstanding dim sum! The Peking duck is too die for. Your going to drop alot of cash but its totally worth it."}
{"text":"Food:  Used to go there every time we travel to Markham from NY.  But due to bad service, we didnt get to try this time.

Service: Totally Bad experience.  The service from the host named TINA will turn my family won't go back there anymore.

We traveled from NY and planned the thanksgiving weekends at Markham.  I knew that we had a big group of 18 (especially we have little kids) and totally understand that it's busy during weekends, so that's why I called the restaurant to make the reservation 2 weeks in advance and specific to ask that we will need collected/next tables because our families have little kids and we travel from NY, Chris was the one who took my reservation and confirmed that they have tables for our group.  

On the day, our reservation was at 12:30 pm, everyone in our group was on time when I checked in, When I checked in and told the host that our group are all here.  The host quickly responded to me in a busy tone, she said: \"you have to wait, we don't have tables for you.  Although, it's a busy day, but I look inside, I saw someone just seating to hold the big tables, saw one big table just seating 2 people.  And then I responded to her,  \"I made reservation 2 weeks ago and I thought you guys should have a management already for our group?  She kept saying, \"I cant help it, it's Saturday, it's very busy, there's no tables for your group together, you guys need to seat separate table!\"  At that moment, I totally freaking out because our group(kids&babies) were waiting outside, and there's no tables for our group??  And then, the host said: \"I will give you one table first\" and then I asked all the kids sit there first because they can't be hanging outdoor but meanwhile, she kept saying, she will have the next table ready for us but it can't be next to each other.  I told her once again, \"Miss, can you see how many kids we have and the reason we are here is enjoy the time together, not separately.\"  Then she got angry and responded me the same way: \" I can't help it, there's no table for your group, what do you want me to do!\"  Up to that moment, I can't hold my temper any more, I told her, \"Fine, if your restaurant can not accommodate big group, do not take my reservation, We can go to somewhere else, you can't just take the reservation and tell me you can't do it as the last minute like this or not even a phone call before our reservation.\"  Then I went inside to the table where our group had seated to see if they're okay.  So my other friends heard that the host was still talking and Balabala about me by the welcome area why so wanted to have table together with other hosts.  At that point, I had to tell everyone that LET'S GO, We don't want to spend money here and deserved a service like this.  We had to go and we preferred to go somewhere else!  
We left the restaurant at 1:10 pm, we went to another restaurant Dragon Boat.  At Dragon Boat, Same busy restaurant,  No RSVP but when I asked for the tables and I told the host our needs, the host was totally considerate and understand our need.  I waited for 45 minutes, finally they got us 2 tables together.  We sat comfortably especially with kids and enjoyed the food there as well.  

This is what happened and deserved a star...
Bye - Casa Imperial"}
{"text":"It sucks when you get your number and see people who come in after you, sit down before you ... Food is ok, have had better ... Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Authentic Hongkong style dim sum served in a fancy ambiance. Steamed dumplings and beef meatballs are my favorites. Great place for family tea time. Check for waiting time before you go."}
{"text":"Ehhhh
Came here for morning tea once with friends and I really must say that nothing... Including the interior, impressed me. Don't get me wrong, it's a gorgeous place, but it just didn't really match its \"outer appearance\". I'm not from HK so I'm not familiar with their standards for good dim sum, but I have been to many places. I just think that this place is a basic restaurant. 

Sorry but I had to get that out"}
{"text":"I have always been against paying top dollar for chinese cuisine. No matter where you go, it's just the same stuff right?

Hell NO!!

This will be the first of a few reviews on Chinese Fine Dining. It's great to see Restaurateurs taking a step back looking at what's important and setting that bar for both DimSum and Dinner.

If you're planning on a cheap meal, this place won't be for you. Expect to pay a premium, but receiving premium quality back. I've been here numerious times for DimSum and Dinner, it's been consistantly top notch each and everytime.

Here's a little history lesson. The head chef is the Original Chef from \"Sun Kwong\" @ Kennedy & Finch when they first opened. He's brings the old school chinese chef qualities, done fresh and with minimum grease and practically no MSG serving us great food.

I believe reviewers that knock this place are used to eating greasy spoon chinese food which pretend to be high end. Can't really blame them, it's been a long time since the foodies of Toronto has experienced good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for family dinners and dim sum. I must say, the last time I went, I was disappointed! 

Their service sucked; their waitresses were so terrible when collecting plates and handing out dishes. This is one of my biggest pet peeves!!! The food was decent, but a little oily.

I hope to never go back again"}
{"text":"What a disappointment and bad experience. Let me share with you what happened to me and my family. I have booked my late lunch at Casa Imperial on Saturday. For my surprise when we arrived they inform me they are having an event that evening thus they can only offer us table close to entrance or washroom even there were many free tables. I just have to mention that restaurant was open not closed at that time. In 5 minutes they start doing big mess rearranging other tables preparing for the event. We got tee and put our order. And start waiting, waiting looking how whole staff was involved in other event preparation. It was too loud even to talk. After 45 minutes without having food I got angry and try to ask one girl (she seemed to be higher level personnel) where was our food. Without any world she took copy of our order and disappeared. Later I saw her going around. She didn't even bother to come back and say what was going on. After 50 minutes waiting with no food, no service we decided to leave that \"better class\" restaurant. I never was treated like that at any restaurant. I felt like unwanted client. BTW if they felt 3 pm it was too late why they didn't call me back saying that? Huge disappointment and regret.
For a very poor service one star is even too much."}
{"text":"For how expensive the dim sum here, I would have expected more, but the dishes were just average in taste and I remember some dumplings we ordered were over spiced with pepper. The interior decor is interesting, as the restaurant is inside a historic building with English architecture, but other than that this place is nothing special."}
{"text":"I am here for a lovely banquet (100 days baby dinner). The foods are decent and the staffs are quick. Its above average comparing to other Chinese restaurant (for banquets)."}
{"text":"We had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes or more...but it was really good and well worth it! I was pleasantly surprised! The decor was real nice. The servers were dressed like French maids. Dim sum was one of the best I've had! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and can't seem to find a food related flaw. Just the washrooms are a bit creepy and stinky. Be warned the food here isn't cheap. Well worth the price you pay. 

I've only come here for dim sum and it's delicious. 

Recommendations:

HawGou: Skins are springy and the shrimp is deveined (poop removed) and always fresh.

Honey Ribs: This is a must try. My husband has fallen madly in love with this dish. I asked if he wanted to marry it and he said 'it doesn't nag at me so sure'

ChiuZhouFunGuo: The stuffing is delicious and they put in fresh peanuts instead of the stale ones I've tried in other places. (not to be named) Also they put Chinese celery instead, extra umph of taste.

PlainRiceNoodles: Very freshly made as well and springy, very smooth and silky. Goes great with the dipping sauce it comes with.

Pumpkin Congee: Delicious! They make it so good. My husband hates pumpkin but he's go for second on this dish.

Papaya Turnover: I think that's the best way I can describe it. It's papaya in this milky cream  insides a fluffy crunchy pilo type multi-layer pastry."}
{"text":"food is always good.. very busy.. service is usually good.. love their chiu chow style dumpling.."}
{"text":"We have the ten course dinner tonight. Food are amazing, even better than HK.  The best is pigeon.  Services are first class. Will come back next year from Houston."}
{"text":"After having not much luck with my dining options during the entire week, I hit jackpot at Casa Imperial on Saturday for lunch. Casa Imperial is a fine Hong Kong style Dim Sum restaurant in Scarborough. The decor is traditional and you will find large chandeliers, lots of mirrors, large round tables and beautiful table cloths. It is a beautiful house and is frequented mostly by Chinese families. The service was attentive and they speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. 

We ordered 7 dishes for 3 people and I think we ordered too much food. It was a feast! The quality of their dumplings is stellar. I was eating and feeling grateful for that experience. It was not my first time at Casa Imperial but it was another fantastic experience. I would recommend anyone to try this restaurant.

We ordered seafood dumplings with spinach, veggie dumplings with thread moss, meat dumpling with crab meat Shanghai style, snowpea leaf and king mushroom dumpling, cuttlefish tentacle with salted spicy,  fried tofu, steamed noodle roll with snowpea leaf and preserved pickle, and fish noodles with mushrooms. My favorite dishes were the seafood dumplings with spinach and the fish noodles with mushrooms. Mind you that the fish noodles were not in their menu. It was a special on that day.

They currently have an anniversary menu for 10 people for 490$. I think is worth the try!

Anyway, I cannot say enough thanks to Casa Imperial for providing the best Dim Sum experience in GTA!"}
{"text":"This is one of the good place to go for Dim Sum.  Contrary the belief that it is expensive, we found that on several occasions that it is priced decently comparable to other restaurants at the same level roughly $15-$18.

In winter, it is harder to find a car park space in its parking lot than a table in the restaurant.  It is advisable to book a table rather than walk in and wait in a long queue.  Before you can get a table will require most of the people to be there.   I think it is fair so that no one can occupy a empty table for long time to wait for the whole party to come.  In that case lengthen the wait time for everyone.

There are lot of variety for Dim Sum.  The Dim Sum list is rather long.  We tend to order the Dim Sum that is not common in other restaurants.  Once in a while, the manager will recommend dishes in addition to the Dim Sum order.  The last recommended fish pot is full of fish and is very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Food tasted good like all Chinese dimsum. Service was fair. Runners fast with food but by the time we left, many items did not come, we were full already, but they tried to give us the food anyway.

Comparable to Chinese food in new york. 

Dirty Chinese food in nice china"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant, very elegant and good food. Great seafood here too, and good service."}
{"text":"Unusually Fancy Place for an Over-priced Experience - Avoid This One

Mom-in-law wanted to go here because her friend highly recommended it to her.  What a mistake that was.

For a Wednesday night, this place was strangely deserted when we arrived around 8:30pm.  If one was looking for a good telltale of a bad restaurant, It was hard to beat an emptied parking lot with only two cars.
  
The dinner menu was way over priced for just about every dish listed--it was probably the most expensive menu I had seen for a chinese restaurant.  We, a group of 3, settled for a dinner combo consisted of 4 course meal; and the bill came out to be $146.90 Can.  Every dish portion was small and was probably not enough for 1 person.  I left there with my stomach half filled and ended up eating instant noodle later on that night.  What a waste of money!  I could get better satisfaction by thowing my money at a fish pond.

The place was nice and fancy, but the decor is somewhat weird--English scene painting from the imperialist period.  I would not be surprised that they were all made in China.  The food was nothing to brag about, but the presentation is fancy.  So, if you want to feel important and only care about anything else but foods; this place is for you.  

Toronto has many many great chinese restaurants serving Cantonese cuisine, but this one ISN'T it.  Don't be fooled by the fake rating it has, and I don't care for the association it tried to show with Lee Kum Kee"}
{"text":"This is probably the fanciest and best dim-sum place I'll ever go to. The restaurant is on Steeles Ave, but is a little hard to spot because it is lined with Canadian flags and looks like an embassy rather than a restaurant.

The prices for the dim-sum are comparable to any other dim-sum place, and the food you get is as hot and fresh as it can get. Maybe it could be a little more expensive, but it is well worth it. 

Eating dim-sum in a old castle formerly occupied by a Scottish person is odd, but definitely go and try it for yourself!

Oh, and no you don't have to dress up."}
{"text":"Food: Dim Sum are excellently made. Most of the food are delicious but some might be a bit salty 

Ambiance: Place looks very fancy but some area needs a few touch up. 
Ex) ceiling and washroom. 
Washrooms have the typical Chinese icky sticky floor and strong bleach scent. 
You would either like the decoration or not. That's a matter of your own taste. I personally feel that it can be a bit tacky. However, I came here to eat dim sum, not the decoration. 

Customer service: Service was slow before ordering. Needed to fetch the waiter/waitress since they aren't that attentive. However, once the order has been submitted, the food came out quick. 

Would advice people with mobility problems to reserve a table at the main floor since there are 3 different floors. Washrooms are in the basement as well. 

Food is a bit expensive but well deserved for its quality."}
{"text":"I love their food. Their Dim Sum are excellent. Hong Kong top chef quality. Service is good. If you ever stop by Toronto you MUST visit this place. You might experience a long wait during peak hours but it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"I am a fan of homes converted into restaurants. Casa Imperial Fine Chinese Cuisine is located in Markham, and is not your average dim-sum spot. 

On the outside it looks like a mansion, and the inside feels like one. 

This is one of the higher-class dim sum spots in the city, and the wealthy Chinese come to eat here. The parking lot is typically filled with Mercedes and other luxury cars. The food is luxurious.

They have shark fins soup at market price. Not for me tho. I am here for the dim sum classics.

Stand out dishes include: BBQ Pork Bun (Char Siu) which does not come in your typical bao, but instead an actual bun. Delicious.
-Scallop and spinach dumplings
-Siu Mai
-Squid tentacles
-Beef Sui Mai
-Meat puff pastry
-Beef ribs (kalbi) in honey sauce

Check this place out if you are looking to splurge on dim sum. This is not your typical push-cart dim sum spot, it is ordered a-la-cart. The service is 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's like having high tea but with dim sum. This converted mansion has a Victorian style atmosphere, complete with matching tea sets. 

Short ribs were noticeably the best I've had in Toronto. They have unique items and definitely looks like they are 1) trying and 2) trying to offer something above the other dim sum restaurants-- and you definitely hope so, especially for the price they charge. 

Food wise, it tasted good. Not completely sure if it is worth the substantial price difference yet. Service was attentive. Definitely fancier than most dim sum restaurants. 

ps. Left on the table was a pamphlet with their banquets meals $2K a table??? The layout being awkward for a wedding aside, really couldn't see how the meal was different over the $1K meal."}
{"text":"Aside from the lucrative fancy decor, there is really not much to praise about this place. There are plenty of parking spots, and there was no line up on a Saturday night. I made a reservation a day before just in case, but was surprised that it wasn't packed at all. 

First off, I would not have ventured into this restaurant if my mom didn't come visit. She prefers Chinese cuisine to Western, but when our bill came to around $585.00 for four people, I hoped that we had spent that money at a nice steakhouse instead. Clearly, everything on the menu was pricey. We ordered shark fin soup, and was thoroughly disappointed at how bad the quality was. Premium shark fin should be served in a still bubbling broth and the fin should be served as a solid piece in which you could tear off the stringy texture after. What we were served here, was a broth (not hot) with stringy (apparently shark fin) vermicelli like contents.. tasted like vermicelli too. There also wasn't any bean sprouts to accommodate the broth.. 

Then, we had the Peking duck. I'm not sure why there are many Yelpers raving about it, but it wasn't the best. The flour wrap was tiny, and the portion of condiments to go with it was minimal - we were advised that it would cost extra to add more. The duck was also very dry. I actually enjoyed the second course better - the crystal wrap. 

The assistant manager was very rude when we were ordering - tapping his foot and glancing around, extremely impatient. However, our server afterwards was a sweetheart, who wouldn't even let us pour our own tea. 

Overall, would not return as the price is not worth the quality of food and service. I\"d spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. 3/6 ppl got sick from their dimsum. This is my first time puking from bad food. I wish I took pictures of the dimsum we ordered to show all yelpers. I dunno why ppl would give it a good rating. The decor was nice, it did look elegant like the name sounded. 

This is my first time in Toronto and everyone recommend to try their dimsum. So me and my friends yelped it and found this restaurant. It's called \"fine dining \" for a reason right? So we walked in hungry and expecting food and service above average. 

Our first dimsum that came was cha siew so. The cha siew was grayish red. It was very dried, and tasted like 1-2 day old left over pork. We also ordered a wonton dimsum that's supposedly pretty famous, it's just spicy, there's no other taste. Same goes for the other dimsum. We ordered about 15 dimsums, none of them tasted decent (and I'm not a picky eater). My friend had to order an iced tea to wash down whatever she ate. Me and another friend threw up mid way eating. 

So we asked the supervisor is the chef different today or something? Cuz what we just ate is definitely not \"fine dining\" standard. He says \"oh... I'm sorry about that. I'll give u 10% off the bill\". My friend then said \"it's not the $$, U need to change something about the food. It's really bad. We came from far away hoping to try good dimsum and now we are leaving disappointed.\" Then he continues \"yea I understand but that's all I can do\". So we were ok cuz we didn't wanna give him a hard time. 

Then the manager comes to ask us what's wrong. And we got into detail about how bad the food is. He said \"Our cha siew so is the best here. We make all dimsum fresh everyday\". Seriously if it were made fresh everyday, cha siew should not be grayish red color. The cha siew so I normally eat is red and saucy. Then he has the nerve to say \"maybe because U guys are from NYC and have higher expectation. Everyone has different taste. You see? My restaurant is filled up with customers. Maybe our food is not to ur high standard\"

I said \"we don't have high standards first of all. We did expect above average food but ur food doesn't even make it to \"decent\"\". And he just kept saying we have high standard blabla. Won't apologize or anything and blamed us. 

We wanted to charge our cards for the bill and he says sorry if u charge then I can't give u discount. Which is total bs. U gave me the discount cuz ur food sucks. It shouldn't have anything to do with whether we pay cash or card. 

Just don't come here. Crown Princess food was MUCH better."}
{"text":"Hello guv'nuh, 

A spot of tea with those dumplings?

This morning I had dim sum here with my family for Lunar New Year.

The first thing I noticed was the decor.
A victorian mansion full of gold, glitter, and gleaming chandeliers.
The servers had these maid like uniforms which was cool.
The teacups were English style with handles! And the teapots were so fancy and decorative.  It was like having high tea, but with chopsticks.

The food was above average but nothing to really rave about.
They had a large variety of dumplings and some nice veggie ones too.
The sticky rice came in smaller than usual cute little packets, tasty savory goodness.
The crab claws were massive!
Noodles came in giant portions.
Egg tarts were flaky, sweet, and delicious.


I gave the place 4 stars because of the restaurant's efforts to transform dim sum into a fine dining experience.  The food was not quite 4 stars worthy.

But really, I wouldn't come here unless someone really wanted to eat here.
Double the price of regular dim sum, but not double the enjoyment (in my opinion).
I found everything a bit stuffy and slightly pretentious including the clientele.
I'd take someone here if I wanted to show them how fancy you can make dim sum, but it's not the place for an authentic dim sum experience.
Just not my style, but I can see why other people like the place."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to enjoy dim sum with friends and family, but most dishes were so salty that my tougue had mild numbness. Also overcooked and tough rubbery shrimps unfortunately.. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding dinner. Decor is nice and intimate for smaller groups. Food is delicious, and quality is better than most other Chinese banquet dinners.

However, you expect to be stuffed after a ten course banquet. You expect to be ready to stop before the fried rice & noodles arrive, after having feasted on giant morsels of seafood. You expect to barely be able to groan down some dessert.

The portions were so small that I ended up filling up on a bowl of rice and a bowl of noodles, and left feeling not really hungry, but not exactly full. 

Given the premium that hosts have to pay for a banquet dinner at Casa Imperial, there's no excuse for the small servings!"}
{"text":"I came here for a full month celebration dinner. We had the best Peking duck I've ever tasted, abalone was cooked perfectly, the shark fin soup was flavoured well, the lobster was served with yummy bean thread vermicelli, the beef stir fry was tender. My hubby and I were stuffed but we couldn't stop eating since the food was so tasty. My hubby loved the food so much he ran around looking for a menu he could keep."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here. I am a regular at Casa Victoria. It was to no surprise that dinner was outstanding and service was exceptional. Each and everyone was very attentive to our table and made small conversations with us.

My family ordered the meal for four people (don't know the name as I didn't place the order). The meal comes with 1) lobster in Maggie sauce and fried glass noodles, 2) abalone, duck feet, and snow peas, 3) steamed bass 4) pigeon, 5) bird-nest dessert, almond cookie, mango red bean jello. In additional to this combo, we added a bowl of 6) shark fin soup per person. All the dishes were made to perfection. I didn't feel thirsty after the meal which is a good sign that there's little or no signs of MSG. 

Highly recommend to come here for dinner if you're looking for a more upscale and elegant Chinese Cuisine Restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"It was my mom's birthday and I planned to bring her somewhere nice for lunch. There were few place I had in mind, but at the end I chose here mostly because it's different. It was a big disappointment, first the place are dirty, the way to the restroom stink, and I can smell the toilet outside the restroom, there were dust everywhere... service were bad, I really expect top notch service because this is a fine Chinese restaurant but I get worse service here than Hong Kong style tea house. Food are average, I have had high end dim sum before both in Hong Kong and Canada but the dim sum here not up to high end standard, and for the price they charge... 
I feel this place is over rated, my overall experience is bad, and I will not go back."}
{"text":"So my bro in law took me here right after I landed from N.Y. on Sunday. I gotta say I was initially impressed by the whole fancy upscale look. But I didn't care cuz I was freaking hungry and we had to wait for 45 minutes. So we get seated in the lower level and we order some usual dim sum: har churn, har gaw, spare ribs etc. Being from N.Y., I had my share of dim sum so being that this place was so freaking fancy, my expectations was super high. Food came, I ate, I compare with what I'm used to in N.Y.and honestly this place is horrible. My first impression of Canadian dim sum was a no no, not worth the money. It might look good on the outside but it don't taste good on the inside. Oh yea service wasn't all that either."}
{"text":"I have eaten my share of dim sum throughout the years especially during the years I was traveling through China and Hong Kong. This was the best EVER outside of China that I have had in Canada. 

Really, its all housemade, for example Haw Gow, it looks and tastes the same no matter where you go...not here they are large with big pieces of shrimp. Other reviewers say its expensive, we I do not think so with Sui Mui is twice the size of other places and hand made on site, its a bargin. You just cannot compare this place with the average dim sum place its the North 44 of dim sum. They have my business thats for you, and I am picky."}
{"text":"This place used to be a steakhouse.Many years ago it became a Cantonese restaurant. It`s a little upscale from the usual Chinese restaurants. We usually go to this restaurant for their excellent DimSum and today was no exception. The food was excellent,the service was good."}
{"text":"I was here because the graceful vegetarian dim sum place near pacific mall was closed for the holiday. Bummer. :/
I was hesitant to come here because it looked kind of expensive and I wasn't planning to have an fancy brunch on that particular day (since going back to school wasn't anything to celebrate), but the bill came out to be like around 60 cad for 2 people and we also got some leftovers packed to go. So overall, I guess it's not on the expensive expensive side and food proportions are decent.
So first of all for the money I paid, I was expecting a kind of nice presentation, but as you can see from the pictures, the food looks ok, I wouldn't say beautifully arranged or even presentable, they spilled the curry sauce and it had gotten all over the bamboo steamer. In one word it was kind of disgusting. 
Then a second word on the rice wrapped in leaf dish. My dads hometown in China is reputable for this snack, so I guess I have some sort of credibility to talk about this, but everyone has different preference and every place makes it different so take my opinion as a grain of salt. Personally I prefer sticky but firm rice. Here the rice was sticky alright but also mushy and lack chewiness. Seems like they steamed it for too long. So not very delighted on that one. 
Taste wise the other dim sum are doing pretty ok, I liked the crystal dumpling with shrimps, the skin is done well and does not fall apart. I also liked the steam rice noodle roll. I would recommend to get those two if you were here."}
{"text":"Was here over the weekend with my friends. We almost missed it because the restaurant looked like a house from the outside. Inside looked really grand unlike any dim sum restaurant we ever been to. Since we arrived right after opening there was no wait time. The food was great and the food portion was larger then what we expected. Will definitely return on our next visit."}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday around 9:00am and got a table of two right away. The restaurant is in aulic style. It's not that noisy, maybe it was still early morning when we were there. We ordered 7 items and it was approx $65 after tax and tips. The scallops and Spinach dumpling is realLy good. The sesame fried ball is highly recommended as the sesame is liquid and We love it. Salted egg yolk bun is my must-have item for dim sum and it is not bad. The shrimp rice noodle is filled with shrimp. The Shanghai style pork dumpling is kinda authentic as I  am a Shanghainese. Overall, this is a descent dim sum place that I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"From the outside you can never imagine this being a Chinese restaurant; as it was a steakhouse back in the days.  The decor at Casa Imperial is amazing once you step inside you can feel that you are in a high-class place.  This is my grandma's fave dim sum place but sadly I haven't been here since she passed away.  As this used to be a steakhouse the spacing doesn't really work for a dim sum restaurant as there are stairs and tight spaces.  Def not a good place to host a wedding, big family dinner as they just don't have the space that everyone can be close together.

The pricing is expensive for dim sum as har gow can cost you around $8. wtf. I can buy a whole combo elsewhere.  And the quality of it doesn't even stand out compare to other places.  The whole place is western looking but serving Chinese food is kinda odd.  Even the teapots and cups are like English style.  The servers wear some weird maid looking uniform as well.  Very odd indeed.

Service is okay from all the times I been but my Grandma knew a lot of people there so that might helped a bit.  The wait time here is awful unless you go super early or late.  The parking lot is small too so you can be waiting for a spot for a good 30 mins.

{"text":"Amazing how I haven't reviewed this place yet, given that I've been here dozens of times.  Good for dim sum, and always packed on weekends.  We come early to avoid that.

Also good for Peking duck.  Although they skimp on the lettuce wraps, big-time!"}
{"text":"Siempre ha sido mi favorito cada vez q visito toronto, pero esta ultima vez que fui hace una semana, no me fue tan bien como anteriormente, de paso esperamos demasiado para que nos sentara, la calidad de la comida ha caido, no esta tan sabrosa como antes, el te tenia sabor a oxidado, como si fuera q esta super vencido, con todo y eso los precios aun sigue siendo el lugar de dim sum mas caro de toronto."}
{"text":"Taking Dim Sum to the next level

You are likely to drive right by Casa Imperial and dismiss it as some stodgy bed and breakfast or a pretentious private euro scene, but then you would miss one of the more interesting dining experiences in The GTA.   

A reservation would be a good idea, as even on a weekday lunch there was a short wait for seating.  Once seated, you will not find servers pushing greasy carts around attempting to ply their wares, oh no, not here.  They have opted for the more civilized approach used in Hong Kong now for quite some time of bringing dishes out by order.  Big is not always an indication of best but I must say the Ha Gow were the size of billiard balls and tasted superior to most other offerings I've ever had.

Many of my fellow reviewers are correct stating the price is higher than most.  They are incorrect stating it is too high or not a value though.  A premium product yields a higher market price, and that is just what you get at Casa Imperial.  This place is clearly the Lexus of Dim Sum in The GTA, enjoy."}
{"text":"Well... came here from out of town... more specifically from Los Angeles. If you've ever been to LA, you'll know that amazing Chinese food is very very easy to come by.  So when we pulled up to this fancy looking mansion I was in awe and had pretty good expectations. I've never eaten dim sum in a fancy house. The wait was long which added to my expectations. Well... the food was decent. The service was pretty good. Food came out quick. 
It's hard not to compare Asian food to what's available in Los Angeles, my expectations are super high. Casa Imperial is \"A-OK\", I'll come back if I'm visiting Toronto again."}
{"text":"the two stars are for the decorations and stunning interior design... the taste is off for most of the dishes and the staff is really impatient and the don't smile at all look...makes them looks like you owe them money..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I know I've been here before but I have no recollection of it whatsoever.  This time though, I will remember for sure.  

The shrimp dumplings were massive.  The skin broke apart fairly easily but man, the shrimp were abundant.   

Shrimp rice rolls also had a similar problem, the rice roll was too soft (overcooked?) and fell apart much too easily.  The shrimp were large and of good quality.  

Other dishes:  siu mai were pretty good, tripe was average, the sticky rice was very good with lots of filling, BBQ rice roll was average, the dough fritter rice roll was alright too...  BBQ pork and pine nut pockets were very good. I think that was all.

Nice fine dining environment. Service was attentive, water and tea filled frequently.  The downside was the servers who brought the food weren't very careful when placing the dishes on the table.  Sauces spilled, but good thing it wasn't on anyone.  

It was very good overall, and I would go back.  However, I think we are feeling the aftermath of MSG...  I may edit this later..."}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 with our boss and his boss. Ordered their special items which were very good though not excellent. Service was excellent. But the price is way more than it was worth. Yes it's nice decor and fine dining. But still. Would rate it $$$$"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not really sure how to rate this: It's average when compared to the dimsum joints in Chicago, but subpar compared to the many other wonderful Toronto spots...and it's pricier to boot. Given all of that, I'm not really sure why there was such a long line to get in.

While the food seems special on paper (swallow's nest egg tart, anyone?), it didn't really translate into reality. In fact, for the price, it was definitely missing the finer points of excellent dimsum, such as delicate wrappings or intricate designs. To be fair, they did try...but did not succeed.

And lastly, there was just something off about the ambiance. Look, I like dimsum and I like museums, but eating dimsum in a museum didn't really synergize for me the way it might have for others. We were seated in a smaller room of only three other tables; it definitely felt more like a museum than a restaurant in there, and as unrefined as it sounds, dimsum just isn't dimsum without having to yell over the din of a hundred other raucous diners. And I echo other reviewers' sentiments that the place as a whole is a bit snooty. 

Go here once just for the experience, but go get better food elsewhere after that."}
{"text":"It'll be my first and LAST visit!

I decided to visit this establishment because our usual place was packed (Ginger and Onion) on Sunday.  My girlfriend and I decided to visit Casa Imperial since it's down the street and thought it'll probably be less people cause it's a expensive than others.  Also, my cousin gave it good reviews.  Oh my, I wish I haven't visited this place.  I should've known, my cousin eats for material things and not with her stomach and tongue!

It's cute cause it's in a Mansion but it doesn't work with dim sum, probably for a western restaurant.  When I walked in, it felt strange cause it's awkward.  I feel it's not being appreciated by Asians.  It has the finer things with fancy tableware and waitress and waiters in butler and maid outfits but it lacks in quality of taste.  The difference in old fashion vs fine dining dim sum.  I prefer my old lady/non-English speaking cart ladies.  The quality is there with expensive garnish (shark fin flakes on siu mai, beef tripe in xo sauce, and etc..) but it didn't taste good.  I've been to better fine dining that given me the WOW factor and this was just LAME!

Decor was horrible!  Asian establishments are known for being a hole in the wall, not likely going to spend lots of money decorating or fixing up. And they didn't, the castle-like restaurant was dirty and dusty, and not overall maintained (other than adding more tables in the hallway)  since what seems like centuries. We were seated upstairs (2nd FL), very tight and crammed.  We had a 2 seater table by the chandelier, and tiny table with big chairs with barely any leg room.  I'm Asian and it was tight, can't imagine for my girlfriend who has long legs.  We we're in between the walkway downstairs, people had to squeeze by (customers and staff).  I was a little appalled cause we were seated next to the chandelier with glass rail.  How nice it was to eat and see the chandelier covered with dust.  EWWW!  

Food was decent.  Decent to the point, it'll probably taste better at a Asian food court that serves dim sum.  Not worth the money!  We usually eat 5-7 plates of dim sum at ginger and onion, which costs between $20-$25 including tips.  Casa Imperial cost us $43 including tips for 5 plates of dim sum.  We've ordered Crispy Pork Buns, Chicken Feet, Siu Mai, Sticky Rice in lotus leaf, and Papaya and Custard cake.  Out of five things we've ordered.  We only liked 1, which was sticky rice.  It's easy to make, my grandma makes it all the time.

Overall, if you want to be ripped off, eat rubbish dim sum, and crammed space.  This is the place!"}
{"text":"My parents have been wanting to check out this place for a while now, and what better occasion to go than when their favourite (read: only) daughter is back in town. Since I've already been to Casa Imperial several times, I was really excited to see if this restaurant would be as good.

The place itself is gorgeous inside. It's definitely strange for a Chinese restaurant. I don't know how wedding banquets can be held here, so the restaurant is split up so much with different floors and stairs. It seemed quite small, and much longer / narrower than I imagined from the outside. 

I suppose most people come here strictly because the food is amazing, because our service was so far off the mark. We had the hardest time getting anyone to come by our table to take our order, refill our teapot, get our bill, etc. despite servers and hosts chatting away to more frequent diners at the tables next to us. It made us feel completely unwelcome, and halfway through our meal we were ready to leave :(

The food is the only saving grace. The sticky rice is fantastic and contains a lot of filling. The pea shoot and king mushroom dumpling had a great flavour to it, and the honey short ribs (as always) were a hit. We also ordered the squid tentacles, but it never arrived so we cancelled it just so we could get out sooner.

The place is posh for sure, there's no early morning dim sum discount (unless you're friends with one of the hosts I assume), so I don't think we'll come back here often. Since the food quality is the same as Casa Imperial, I think we'll just head back there instead - I find the people there so much nicer."}
{"text":"My Chinese co-worker promised to take another colleague and myself out for an authentic Chinese meal. Work was paying so we came here. We were originally supposed to go to Casa Victoria? but they had a wedding that night. So in the middle of a snowstorm, we arrived early for dinner and I was far more impressed than I thought I would be.

The place looks like a gilded palace of gold, with multiple floors festooned with opulent paintings and chandeliers. Normally places that have such a precious decor don't have very good food. How wrong I was.

Our co-woker ordered for us Shark fin soup ( I know, I know), Peking Duck two ways, Fried whole lobster and Chinese Greens.

I had no idea what to expect of the soup, but the flavour was delicate and salty. I almost fainted when I saw that one bowl of soup was almost $70! Was it worth it? I don't know as this was the first time I've had it so I have nothing to compare. I liked it. Maybe too much.

Then a waiter appeared with a gleaming trolley upon which sat a golden roasted Peking Duck. He sharpened his knives dramatically and sliced the duck breast razor thin. The server brought a tray of thin crepes and gently placed a piece of the tender sliced duck and it's crispy skin on each crepe. Scallions, carrots and cucumbers were provided with a delicious homemade plum sauce. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven...DUCK TACOS!!

I know. That's really ghetto of me to liken their Peking Duck to tacos, but the reality is that I love tacos and I love duck. This was my new favourite food.

After shaving a few additional bits of duck and placing them in the crepes, they wheeled the duck off. What?? Where did my duck go? That was hardly the meat from an entire duck?? Whaaaaaa... Huh---- Oh, look... LOBSTER!!

Pre cracked, crunchy lobster in a sweet aromatic sauce. The Colonel has nothing on this finger lickin' dish!

Chinese Greens were dark and perfectly cooked in a sauce that had nary a hint of cornstarch goo.

And then.... the duck returned... as a Crystal Roll!

The rest of the duck was returned to the kitchen and diced with mushrooms, noodles and peanuts and served with giant leaves of iceberg lettuce for wrapping. The complimentary textures and temperatures were mind blowing. I never paid a lot of attention to Chinese Food as I had been assaulted for years with Lemon Chicken, Sweet and Sour Ribs and Beef Lo Mein. All of the sauces were always far too sweet and had the consistency of a bodily fluid that shall remain nameless.

These sauces had depth, texture and intensity and the ingredients were fresh and inspired. I was so caught off guard that it further enticed me to research all the dishes upon returning home and a pretty decent attempt at making them myself.

All in all this was the best Chinese Food experience of my life to date. I think the bar has been set pretty high for any competition."}
{"text":"Access
You can TTC or drive. The parking lot isn't huge but it should suffice - since it is never really packed. By the way if you are coming down South on Warden, make sure you merge to the right lane immediately. Funny observation: people always say this place is for the \"wealthy\" and I read some reviews where others claim you only see \"BMW\" or \"Benz\". You shouldn't be ashamed or embarrassed to come here because no one should judge your socioeconomicl status.

Service
Do they get paid $6/hour or do they just work at snail speed? This place looks awesome on the inside, outside, everywhere; it is like top notch in appearance. Who hired these people? The only individuals who know how to do their jobs are the managers - why so sad? To begin, they mixed up the tea we wanted..we asked for \"water\". How do you even get that wrong and give us tea? And don't worry we did order tea afterwards but we started off with water. Afterwards the lady bringing out the food gave our plates to the wrong table TWICE. There was this dude who was so slow, when we asked for the bill he never came back. I thought Chinese people were fast with these stuff? I can't even fanthom how rich people can endure this HORRIBLE service. I'm guessing they are always served by the managers...seriously.

Food 
Honestly good. They don't cheap out on you and everything comes out fresh. Even the soy sauce comes out in a nice bottle - WARM! The only part of the service that was good was in clearing out the dishes. Every time I finish picking out the last piece in our dish...WHOOM someone picks it up (is that even a sound?). You are looking at some really unique dishes though prices are a bit higher. It goes something like this:

Small dishes - $3 ish
Medium dishes - $4 ish
Large dishes - $5 ish

Let me make it clear to you that everything is either in medium or large dishes. What I really like is that they don't cheap out on the meat and when you order a BBQ bun, you do get the BBQ pork (it's not for show lol).

The food quality can be rated as 1 of the top 5 dim sum restaurants in GTA. But the quality in service brings it down to top 15 lols. I have actually been here twice and my first time was a bit better. It's not overpriced because of the food, it is not worth the price because of the service =p"}
{"text":"Line up took way too long. Interior is clean and well decorated with antiques and grand wall paintings. However it was not worth waiting 2 hours. The service was okay and not the greatest. They didn't check up on us nor did they refill our tea until we asked twice. On the plus side, food quality is indeed a tad more fresh compared to many of its neighbouring dim sum restaurant. The downside is that it took quite a while for the orders to come. I wanted a nice picture of at least half or most of what we ordered but they took too long and food was getting cold. They also forgot an item that we ordered and it never came out. Last but not least, parking was a pain to find with limited private parking space."}
{"text":"Wedding banquet: nice place for a small wedding. This restaurant is actually in a mansion so there doesn't seem to be a big enough hall to fit too many people. The wedding I went to was quite small maybe 50 people.

We had the usual Chinese banquet: 1) Roast pig, the slices were quite thin with equal proportion of skin to fat to meat. I don't know if that's your thing. 2) Stir fried geoduck and shrimp and celery, which I thought was pretty good not too oily. 3) Shark fin soup, I am not a huge fan but this was way too watered down. 4) Broccoli with abalone, abalone was small but was done well with good texture and flavour. 5) Vegetables with King oyster mushrooms, again not too oily or salty, good taste. 6) Soya sauce stir fried lobster, there was a good portion and flavour, and not overcooked, which is pretty important. 7) Rice and efu noodles were decent. 8) Dessert was red bean soup, cookies and what resembles a mango mochi filled with cream. I thought the mango mochi was creamy and light tasting but definitely fatty! 

Overall I was satisfied with the food, not too oily or salty and nothing was overcooked. The venue was okay, the decor seems really grand and extravagant and maybe clashy,  but for a Chinese restaurant it's not so bad. The washrooms are in the basement but seems newly decorated. As I said before the few rooms seem to be quite segregated so you won't get a big hall that can fit too many people. They also had nice linen and charger plates, nicer than what I thought would be here. The service was pretty good, they catered to everyone even other vendors. The manager checked on us all the time, but we were the only one there, it was a Wed but really? The servers wiped the table of any food after she served each course, which was surprising for me for these places. I thought the place was good and there's ample parking. I liked the food, I only wish there was better layout and decor in the interior."}
{"text":"Second trip back, and I still have to say it's one of the best dimsum experiences in north america.  If I had a real complaint, I'd say it was the service; service doesn't match the decor.

Let's back up.

Set in a mansion built with european sensibiliites, Casa Imperial sports architecture and art inspired by Europe with attendant colours and sculpture.  Porcelain fixtures are mostly mainland Chinese, but that shouldn't surprise anyone.

Spacing is generous-ish and there is level upon level of seating.  Dimsum is ordered by checking off a menu, so in theory, everything is made to order.

Flavours are delicate and oil levels are quite polite leaving the diner with an experience that is much closer to high end dim sum a la Hong Kong than what one gets all to often in the US.  Toronto is another beast entirely, so a real standardization to what you all get here is tough for me to do...  

To Steve K, I would disagree; I eat in NYC a lot as well, and I still don't think it's normative in NYC, but to each his own.

Food and selection is excellent-

Service leaves much to be desired, especially for price relative to chinese peers.  If you'd like a \"veneer\" of fine dining, the veneer ought be a bit thicker.  :)"}
{"text":"I drove by this place for five years thinking it was a hotel of some sort until discovering it is a dimsum place.

The food here is pretty good, but some dishes came warm as if it has been sitting out for a while before served to us. 

The servers were helpful and attentive. They have their own section, so our waitress stayed with us in our room the whole time. Most Asian places do not do that, so it was nice not having to wave your arms intensely to get some attention. 

I would definitely recommend this place to others. It is also a great place for casual business lunches because it has a very classy European inspired design to it."}
{"text":"This place has great tasting dim sum and you can taste the quality in their products compared to other places that have a set pricing on dim sum before 11am. It is on the pricier side but worth it :) 

My favourites are their mushroom/bamboo shoots egg rolls and the crystal dumpling with peanut, parsley with hot sauce.

The service is quite good and you can usually get a spot easily if you go before 9:30am - anytime after 10 it becomes harder to get a spot without some wait."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting Toronto, and my Uncle took us to his favorite dim sum place. 
Gosh, the line was horrendous. We came around 10 am, and did not get seated til NOON ! 1.5 hour of waiting ! and i found out reservations can be made... aaiiyaaa Uncle ...

We had a party of 9, and had about 20 + orders of food. Despite the long wait, the food came out really quick. The har gow and siu mai reminded me of \"Lunasia\", a dim sum restaurant back in Los Angeles, big pieces with lots of shrimp. Overall the food was good, the service was like any other typical asian restaurant, fast paced semi friendly. Our bill came out to a little less than $200 (CAD) ?? A little pricier than your average cheap quick dim sum spot in Los Angeles but the food is more than an average dim sum spot.

Yes I would come back to this dim sum spot if im in the area. Just call beforehand for reservations...
*this restaurant used to be an estate/mansion back in the 1800s...pretty cool."}
{"text":"The battle of the dim sum between Vancouver and Toronto continues...

If you are in Toronto for some of the best dim sums outside of Asia, your choices are close to numerous.  But there is one place that you have to go once -- just so that you've been there!

Casa Imperial.  It's a one-of-a-kind Chinese restaurant that's housed in a Victorian style mansion.  Read the reviews and you'll see terms like gaudy, over-the-top, showy, Victorian, European, Colonial, historical, classy, elegant, opulent, fine dining, expensive, luxurious, etc.  Choose the adjectives that appeal to you... or turn you off...

I actually enjoyed the experience as it is quite certain that this cannot be found anywhere in the United States.  I don't think places like this exist even in Hong Kong anymore, although they probably existed during the height of British colonialism. 

I usually go to these places with a reasonably low expectation for the food, but the dim sums turned out to be really good.

I particularly liked a few of their unique creations:

CRISPY BEAN CURD RICE NOODLE ROLL:  The rice noodle was literally paper thin and very smooth, and was definitely up to par with even the toughest Hong Kong standard.  It was filled with a freshly fried and crispy bean curd skin, which was stuffed with pork and shrimp (versus a fish paste in a more common recipe).  It was served with a yummy and somewhat sweet soy sauce that came in a cute sake wine bottle.

EGG ROLL WITH TARO:  It has to be one of my most favorite egg rolls as it was stuffed with thinly shredded taro (among chicken, pork, and other goodies) which added a completely unique and delicious dimension to the egg roll.  The flavors were quite rich and could be salty for some people, but it was perfect for my palate.

MUSHROOM AND ZUCCHINI DUMPLING:  A very creative, refreshing, and tasty item that is much needed in the dim sum scene.  The skin was probably exactly the same as that of a har gow (shrimp dumpling) skin.  The fillings were made with thinly diced sautéed mushroom and zucchini which were moist and juicy.  It was very flavorful for a vegetarian dish and I was impressed.

Vancouver versus Toronto.  Dead heat.

Which means I have to visit both cities for more dim sum again... LOL..."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum with some coworkers. The food was very good, with quite a few choices. It was pretty pricey for dim sum, but then again, we ordered a lot of food and had a couple big boxes of leftovers. It gets super busy around lunch time, so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Comments and rating based on dim sum experience only.  

Why go to this place when there are at least a half dozen restaurants in the area that offer similar quality food at less price? -- where else can you have the unique experience of having Chinese dim sum in a (non-Chinese) mansion? 

Dim Sum Style -- order from a dim sum menu, no push carts. Because the food is prepared fresh after you've placed the order, it's the way to go. 

Quality and Selection -- \"standard\" selections plus a few speciality creations like Sticky Rice Dumpling with whole conpoy (dried scallops), chicken fillet with lemon grass, etc. I really like steamed rice noodle roll with dough fritter and dried scallops inside (the menu says \"deep fried dough w/ conpoy), the fritter is perfectly crispy and the rice rolls moist and silky smooth. 

Service -- attentive enough. The noisy level seems to be lower in this restaurant compared to other Chinese restaurants, so if you want to have a quiet conversation, it's possible. 

Keep this on the to-go list? -- It's not a get-a-quick-bite dim sum place, but a nice place to take guests to."}

deep fried dumpling with meat and chives (ham sui gok), mediocre. 
shrimp and peach crispy roll with mayo sauce, excellent.
deep fried banana drizzled with honey, ok. 
milk tart in swallow's nest, excellent. 

while the bill was much higher than i expected - $75 including tax and tip - the quality of food and the atmosphere justifies the prices. i would definitely return the next time i feel like splurging on dim sum."}
{"text":"DAAAMNNN!!! Is what we said when we stepped through the door. My friend and I were dressed as American slobs so we really clashed with all the fancy paintings, chandeliers, professional staff and shear ambiance of Casa Imperial. Then we remembered we were here at a Chinese restaurant for dim sum and not tea and crumpets. It's amazing here. Dim sum is quality I guess.... its good but the ambiance was what really grabbed us. After so many years of eating dimsum, I can't tell whats good anymore. I guess all the ingredients and the skins on the dim sum were top quality and had great tooth to them? Yeah i just want to take the 9 hour drive from Boston just to be here. The food is good but i love the ambiance a bit more."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is expensive and really fancy-looking. I've been here for special occasions where we just wanted a nice dinner. The restaurant is in a former mansion that housed a steakhouse. The tables are quite spread apart over a few floors, so it is much quieter than every other Chinese restaurant I've been to. I personally really enjoy the food and think it's quite high quality. I can't say that it is bang for your buck or worth every penny you pay, but you're kind of paying for the atmosphere and experience to. Want to really impress someone with Chinese food? Come here."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum place to go when in Toronto. Nice ambience inside old Victoria style building. My favorites are crispy shrimp peach roll, seafood congee with salted egg. But everything else is spot on."}
{"text":"Food is good, not your average price restaurant. Glad to have an economical seafood dinner for 4, as my daughter does not eat meat.
Portion is small, more like dinner for 3 person.

Now, disappointingly, a $65 per person dinner, the rest room is filthy. 2 of 3 stalls, one plugged. The other one is all wet in the seat.

Lack of staffing to moniter washrooms?

I think twice to return and definitely try not to use the ladies room.
Sigh!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend going here if it's your first time. In general, the food either tasted like it was stale, too bland or too salty. We ordered about 20 of their dishes of dim sum but none of it tasted good. I'm generally not too picky about dim sum food but my experience here was just bad.

I came here to eat with some friends during a trip because the exterior looked good. Yelp says they were 3.5 star but generally we know not to trust yelp for Chinese food. I was very disappointed to realize it was way below it's rating. 

Since it was my first meal of the day I decided to still try to eat most of what we ordered so that it doesn't go to waste. Unfortunately 10 minutes after eating I felt sick to my stomach and ended up having to vomit everything back out. Most likely something was not cooked properly. 

Before the we left we did complain to the manager about the food. We wanted to give them some advice so that they could improve their food quality. They were nice and said they would even give us a 10% discount which we thought was good customer service. However when we wanted to pay with our credit card he said that we can not pay by credit card if they give us the 10% discount. That was just absurd and it sadly just brought down their customer service rating."}
{"text":"Presentation is good. Food average but pricy! Customer service is good and overall atmosphere was okay. Expected to be much fancy than what I experienced and will not come back due to over priced"}
{"text":"So, my uncle and aunt were raving about how great the food here was, but it really wasn't that great. I mean don't get me wrong, the food was good, but i guess my aunt and uncle were raving about how great it was, that I had very high expectations about this place. The food is good though, but some of the items they need to work on. Like the skins for the dumplings were very crumbly... right when I try to pick one up with my chop stick, everything falls apart. 

Anyways, this is one of the nicest restaurants... actually no, one of the nicest Chinese restaurants I've stepped into. So my uncle tells me this place use to be a French restaurant, and they turned it into a upscale Chinese restaurant. The place is amazing. Its just remarkable to be able to dine in a restaurant like this. They just have to work on the dumpling skin!"}
{"text":"My venturing north of Bloor is about as rare as the Transit of Venus, but one fine Sunday I had a round-trip ticket on the Someoneelsescar Express and we decided to Chinese Five-Spice up our brunch plans. I'd been interested in trying some serious dim sum for a while and a colleague suggested both Casas Imperial and Victoria.

Our party of 5 arrived slightly early for our 11:30am reso and the place was bumpin'. Seemed authentic (read: we were the sole purveyors of Jewish flava). 11:30 came and went. The hostess advised that without a reservation, we'd be waiting even longer. Fair enough!

Service was pretty fast after we were seated. We ordered a variety of dishes, my favourites being the pumpkin & seafood dumplings (YUM), large shrimp dumplings, fried turnip cake and crispy taro little footballs (name undetermined). I said I didn't like the cuttlefish tentacles but I ate 3 anyway. There was a lot of random meat in seemingly vegetarian/pescetarian dishes, so make sure you ask ahead.

The bill was very reasonable, considering the meal kept us full on our journey of 40 days and 40 nights back to the downtown core."}
{"text":"Casa Imperial is housed in a historic mansion that was formerly a steakhouse. The decor is very Western and not at all what you'd expect of a dim sum restaurant. Walls adorned with replica paintings of medieval Europe while chandeliers hang from the ceiling really make you feel like you're here for high tea.

The dim sum servers are dressed in (tasteful) French-maid-like attire (this ain't Hooters boys!) and even the China is very European.

You will pay a premium to have dim sum at Casa Imperial but it is worth every penny. In addition to the standard dim sum items you will also find premium/specialty items such as Swallow's Nest Egg Tarts and Dried Scallops (Conpoy) sprinkled Fried Doughnut wrapped in Rice Noodles for example.

The premium you pay is reflected in the ingredients as well as the filling (e.g. more shrimp than wrapper in the dumplings), quality and service.  Dim sum restaurants usually are not conducive to having a conversation that is not publicized because its usually very loud but Casa provides for a relaxing experience, especially if you get put in one of the smaller dining areas. The table we had was in a smaller room of about 4 tables.

All in all we ordered 11 dishes between 3 people and the bill was about $75 with tax and tip. We were stuffed to the nines and walked out with happy tummies."}
{"text":"the food here is outstanding! I came last sept for a wedding and we had a the full 10 course meal. Each item was served and eaten really quickly. I haven't been here on a regular day for lunch or dinner but I am sure that it is amazing. It is really great service and the lavish decor gives it the 'imperial' feel."}
{"text":"An unfamiliar atmosphere when one thinks of a dim sum tea house, Casa Imperial is one of the strangest, yet best tasting restaurant.

Housed in what can only be described as a Victorian-era manor, the first time one passes by, one can only assume that it is a place for parties, functions and other formal gatherings. However, it is open to the public and once inside, the old English atmosphere continues to befuddle and bewilder.

Never mind this, onto the most important part, the food.

The food initially comes across as pretentious and unnecessarily dressed-up, but upon further inspection, the addition of key ingredients serves to add a complex nuance to a simple flavor.

Simply put, the food tastes better.

Also appreciated is a lack of MSG present in the items, as that is not always the case.

The quality of all of the traditional items is top notch, and the special items are very good too.

Definitely my favorite dim sum restaurant based on food quality alone in the GTA, though the price does leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Coming from Boston, where the Chinatown is small and dim sum options are extremely limited, this place was as good as dim sum gets to me. I was in awe of everything from the elegant European interior to the silverware to the delicious food. While things are on the pricey side, I have to say that the increase in quality is worth it! This was definitely all in all a memorable experience. I love how big the shrimp dumplings are - as well as the shrimp contained within. Definitely a must-order! 

Honestly... (and I have to devote a whole paragraph to this message) what made this a truly 5 star experience was the fact that the sesame ball pastries served here have BLACK SESAME filling. I don't know about you, but I find black sesame paste to be 23498X superior to red bean paste, especially since most places will serve the typical sesame balls with red bean filling. Can I just say - when I bit into the crispy exterior expecting the trite taste of red bean but instead tasted sweet, fragrant black sesame, I was euphoric. It truly consolidated this 5 star review for me. 

If nothing else - after reading this review, you know that you've got to order the sesame balls."}
{"text":"Every time I passed by this place on a weekend, it was PACKED. The wait would be approx 1-2 hours so I never went. However I went at around 2pm and there no was no line and not many people in there. 

Ordered some har gow which was amazing! Chicken feet was made differently than usual dim sum places but it was really good. For dessert obviously got the egg tarts :D They don't use the yolk so it's egg whites but it's delicious. Other things ordered: steamed beef tripe (no flavour AT ALL even with the sauce - would not recommend), turnip cakes, sticky rice.

Service was decent! Food generally decent."}
{"text":"Dim sum here is pretty good.  They offer some dishes that differ from other dim sum places.  Pricier than the average dim-sum place.

Went here for dinner for Father's Day.  The food was terrible.  The flavor lacked and the price was quadruple for what's it's worth.  We were there at 6:30pm.  We ordered suckling pig.  30 minutes later we were told that they \"sold out\"... how is that possible.  It's prime time dinner time we were there pretty early.  Tables were not even filled up.  In the end, we were charged for the suckling pig ($70) and had to get the bill adjusted.  Good thing we took a look at the bill.  I think they tried to scam us.  Doesn't the order get removed from the bill as soon as you tell the customer the restaurant \"sold out\" of a certain food?"}
{"text":"In Toronto for the weekend and was so glad that we had a chance to try Casa Imperial. We got there early so didn't have to deal with the wait.  The food was delicious.  Service was nice.  The Dim Sum was as good as NYC/Flushing if not better.  I wish we had more time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family. This place used to be a Victorian style restaurant. Now the new owners more or less kept all the decor and fixtures. So I feel like a wannabe aristocrat while having dinner and all. 

Let's jump to the food. Everything is pretty fresh and not over flavoured. And definitely not oily at all. Food came out piping hot. And the overall experience is pretty good."}
{"text":"No lineups for dim sum at 2:30pm on a Saturday. Very fancy Victorian style mansion and decor, although it wasnt matched by the sloppyish food presentation, not that it matters. Service was quick.

They had some unique dim sum dishes I havent seen elsewhere. Really recommend the milk and papaya puff pastries, it was filled with warm milky goodness surrounded by thin layers of pastry, so soo milky - it oozes when biting into it that I was trying to savour each bite. The crispy sesame balls filled with salted egg yolk came in fours, usually other places give three, although they were on the smaller side... it was filled with a good amount of delicious yolk!

Pricier than the average dim sum restaurant but food was fresh, came hot, and yummy."}
{"text":"The service was really good. It's a beautiful restaurant inside and out. Food was not what I hoped for but it was okay."}
{"text":"I came here a few times with my family on Sundays when I was younger - it's easy to find a table when you have connections but the wait for a table for Sunday Dim Sum is actually ridiculous. For the premium price you're paying, I don't think the food quality is there to be quite honest. A lot of my friends and relatives hype up this place but I think it's only popular because it's known to be expensive and up-scale compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area. 

I've also been here quite a few times for a corporate event, wedding, and several dinners. None of their dishes really make me go \"wow\" as the dishes are really standard and you can pretty much find them elsewhere in any Chinese restaurant. However, their peking duck is great! 

Overall, I wouldn't go to Casa Imperial as it provides average food at best for an expensive price tag. It's so incredibly busy on Sundays so make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"Don't bother making a reservation at this low client service restaurant. I made a reservation and didn't get seated until 40min after. As well the parking lot is just horrendous. We got to the restaurant on time and was told to wait 10-15min additional. After the 10-15min- we were told to wait another 15min. When I tried to speak to the employee about incorrect waiting times- she passed me to her supervisor right away. When I tried to speak to the supervisor- she passed me to the general manager right away. No one took ownership of the problem or tried to make things better. The general manager was essentially useless to finish off. He did not even apologize for making a client wait over half an hour for a reserved table. I get restaurants get busy but failing to set the right expectations to a client twice... how do you expect your business to succeed in the long term? Just to add the supervisor was also trying to bad mouth me in front of another client waiting in Chinese hoping I wouldn't understand her throughout the whole process. I'm just astounded."}
{"text":"We went here as a small group as a preliminary test meal for a potential Chinese banquet wedding.  For anyone who's never had a truly great Chinese Wedding Banquet (and I pity you), know that you can come here to splurge without having to pay tens of thousands of dollars for an actual event!

We wound up ordering several classic banquet dishes off the regular menu, and boy, is this place impressive.  As others online have suggested, this is not your typical Chinese restaurant.

Eaten:

- Wedding appetizer selection of Roast Suckling Pig (perfectly crispy and delicious), marinated Jellyfish (hint of sesame, and of the highest quality, which, I guess was only obvious to those of us who'd had it before), Crab Claws stuffed with Shrimp Mousse (again, perfectly executed - tender and delicately-seasoned), all served with the time-tested appropriate dipping sauces (hoisin for the suckling pig, and red vinegar for the claws)
- Braised Mushroom and Whole Japanese Abalone (intensely flavourful dried Chinese Mushrooms, rehydrated and served alongside chewy, in a good way, abalone)
- Squab (this was the one thing we probably would not order again, it was deliciously-prepared with a lemon sauce, but none of us were fans of paying good money for only a speck of great tasting skin and maybe a thumbful of meat)
- Braised E-Fu noodles (this is a type of noodle that I don't imagine a lot of non-Chinese people are very aware of - these are thick, and go through a lot of work to make, fry, dry, re-hydrate and finally cook - and there really is nothing like them - they are silky and light and absorb flavours like sponges)
- White Fried Rice with Conpoy - no soy sauce, and served with ingredients that support the light-coloured theme, egg whites, conpoy (a delicacy of crispy dried, shredded scallops)
- Steamed Fresh Sea Fish with Soya Sauce (the name does nothing to describe how completely wonderful this dish is - the fish is served whole, but is carefully deboned and served to you at the table - the flavour is derived from the freshness of the fish and the subtlety of the complex soy-based sauce - this is NOT some grocery store sauce thrown over a random piece of fish)
- As a complimentary item, we were served the classic wedding banquet dessert of Red Bean with Lotus Seeds and Lily Bulbs (I wasn't a fan of this, but others adored it - it's a sweet bean porridge)
- And, we were also given some Chinese petits-fours (I think there were three different cakelets per person)

We would've replicated the rest of the standard Banquet menu, but alas, we needed the rent money.

As for the decor, if it weren't for all the Asian people, you'd think you were there to have traditional English tea.  Immaculate.

The service was extremely professional.  And for us, at least, it was full-service, we barely had to lift our forks to our own mouths, everything was served out to us, with appropriate changes of china and cutlery.

For four, the meal came out to about $300 with tax and tip, which, considering the quality of the place, the service and the food, was quite reasonable"}
{"text":"I was here many times and considered this place a decent restaurant.  Although dishes were priced higher than usual, I found that the classy decoration, the fine china, the above-average  dim sum and ok services kind of justified the extra dollars.  

This morning's experience was really totally different: 1. The cups and bowls were dirty - boy, this really turned me off!     2. The waitress flew the pencil back to our table after taking our order form - She was like a child in the primary school.   3. The server who put a dish on the table used her pen to flip the falling piece of meat back to the plate - God, this is supposed to be a classy restaurant, right?  4. The dim sum dishes were either tasteless or too oily - is the Chef on vacation?

I don't know how a decent restaurant could go down hill like this.. Sigh.   They will definitely need to beef up the kitchen, control the dish washing process and train their staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dim sum place to go whenever we visit Toronto/Markham. We've never had trouble getting seating, but we tend to go super early on a weekday. The restaurant itself is nice and classy. It's a nice place to relax in the morning and just eat your dim sum if you're not into that shoving-hustle-bustle morning dim sum environment. You know what I'm talking about. When not-your-grandma shoves you out of the way when you're in line to get a table and you stand there flabbergasted because you can't hit old people.

The food here is definitely pricey, but it is very good quality. My absolute favorite thing to get is the Milk Tart with Swallow's Nest. It's like an egg tart but soooo much better. The crust flakes off and you can tell it's not those low quality chunky ones. The cuttlefish tentacles are also a must-order. So crunchy and well-seasoned! Never been disappointed by those two. They make the food fresh when you tick off the items on the menu, so you feel good knowing it wasn't rolling around in a cart for hours (like how they do it where I'm from)."}
{"text":"Casa Imperial took my Virginity. First time in my life I've EVER spent $7.10(!) on Har Gow, OMG. It got me all emotional, I felt my Wallet getting gooey wet. They put their Name next to the word \"Har Gow\" so how can a first-timer avoid doing that obligatory check-mark? CHECK 

I felt instantly pretentious just stepping inside this Mansion, \"ME\" pretentious because some items on the Menu cost more than the clothes on my back. I'm the old-school Dim Sum-er with even older-school mentally with 1990s pricing. I haven't quite caught up to the 21st century with the Health Trend and over-the-top Ingredients. Age-Gap? CHECK

{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and specially ordered the wintermelon soup which was not the best for $80 somethign. Theyre presentation was nice but the prices of what they gave you and the quality of the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place. This place looks like a house at the corner of Steeles and Warden. It has a nice courtyard and its own parking lot. From afar this place looks really nice. This place is actually a house turned into a restaurant. The interior decor is very grand with lots of classical paintings on the walls. D and I came here for dinner with his friends the Friday before Thanksgiving. I have to say the service of this restaurant is really good. The food quality is also very good. However, in terms of the price I thought it was bit on the pricey side. We didn't order the set meals, instead we ordered a la carte in which we ordered the peking duck as one of our dishes. Overall the experience and the food was good here. But I think in terms of price, it was pricier then I expected."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while since moving out of the area. Being a Sunday night, going to and leaving was pretty good (i.e. turning left out). 

Relatives from HK had 3 tables in one of the smaller rooms for a small banquet. The appetizer suckling pig was quite good and not too fatty. The jellyfish that accompanied the dish was well seasoned without any fishy taste. 

They served shark fin which I'm VERY against as the shark finning industry is EXTREMELY corrupt and sharks are WAY OVERFISHED without any real control, but that's another story. Basically the old people at our table ate it while the younger more knowledgeable and conscientious folks declined. Even the waiter was understanding.

There was a spicy mushroom (battered and fried) with scallops which was tasty. It would've been a nicer presentation if each plate got 2 scallops since they were pretty small. 

Lobster was well prepared and very tasty. 

Instead of chicken, we were served pigeon which I don't eat but my mom said that Keungs makes a better one. 

Steamed fish was pretty good. 

We had to leave early but some leftovers of the noodles were brought back and they were good!

I'd be interested in seeing how dim sum is like."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say for the food because the quality is easily justified by its price however service is a different story.  When you're paying on average $50 a head for dinner, you'd expect above average service if not at least average service.  I don't know if the manager at this place just turns a blind eye to their waitresses or they just don't have any training at all but I thought a lot of this is common sense.  You never reach over your patrons when without excusing yourself first.  They just barge in between you with their serving tray placed right in front of your face because you should've seen her coming and moved out of the way? No matter how good the food is, TERRIBLE service means its not worth my time or money"}
{"text":"Came here again because my parents know I loved this place last time but the food wasn't nearly as good this time around. Mom tells me that some of their chefs left to another restaurant. could it be true? tell me where they went!!!

Anywhoo, still has the best lotus wrapped sticky rice chicken in the city!  The rest is still good but not as awesome.....  try their lo mein - very nice and light!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place for a couple times for dim sum which has been not bad. 
This place has always been packed for dim sum. 
First time went for dinner, and was not busy at all, but maybe is also an indication of it's quality ----BAD

Food was not horrible, but definitely OVER PRICED and really just MEDIOCRE that you can get from most Chinese restaurant. Although worth mentioning, we order a rib dish, which was indeed TERRIBLE. WORST Garlic Rib EVER! Ribs were cut into HUGE pieces and deep fried without any taste. We even thought that the meat was NOT FRESH!

HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! They gave us a tiny table for four and refused to give us a larger table, even though most of them are empty. The server knew about that we are not happy with the seating but pretended that he know nothing and remained cold and did nothing. 

And when ordering food, the manager was so HARD SELL and pushed us to get a huge combo, which was definitely a better value but we didn't get it because we couldn't finish that much food. 

Then when the food came, they brought up a wrong dish, which was OKAY. But that manager came up and insisted that we ordered the wrong food. Without saying a single sorry word, he eventually ended up RELUCTANTLY + ANGRILY took back that dish and replaced it with the right one. JUST RIDICULOUS!

We came in to celebrate and thought that given it's high-end quality, it should be A safe place to have a decent dinner, well, at least, aN okay one. 

But ended up having a bad over-priced dinner with horrible service. 
VERY DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Had the worst dim sum experience in my life here. When we walked in today, we felt like we were not welcomed. The 3 staff chatting in the corner ignored us. When we finally had a table, we were greeted with another staff member by the name of Angela. She gave us attitude while we were there. They got our order wrong for one of the item and didn't even say sorry. Worse service ever."}
{"text":"I came here through a recommendation from a friend that this was her favourite dim sum restaurant and boy, did they deliver! At first I was very peeved about the long wait - nearly an HOUR - since the hostess told us it would be about 20 mins (we went to the chatime closeby to grab some bbt to kill some time). Thankfully the hostess did apologize a few times for the long wait and explained that 2 people tables were very limited. Eventually we were seated in a small room that only had 4 tables. 

We got the standard dim sum dishes such as the sui mai, har gow (this never came), chicken legs, curried baby octopus, tripe, steamed bbq pork buns, deep fried taro puffy dumpings (I forgot what these are called), and mango pudding. Oh my god, the food was delicious! I don't usually order those taro puffs but I saw another table have them and decided to give them a go and I'm so glad I did. They were crunchy on the outside and the filling was full of flavour. The taro was cooked to perfection! The chicken feet were a little bland at first but then after sitting in the sauce for a while they were much better. 

Aside from the long wait, I am excited to come back here again for those delicious taro puffs! Next time I think I'll come with a larger group and make reservations :P 

Another note, they charge you for tea. But it's really good tea!!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum in Toronto is GREAT!  What appears like an old fashion manison on the outside is actually a large banquet hall restaurant.  I love the facade of this restaurant as it is very discreet depicting someone's home which I actually at first I thought I was visiting someone.  Large wall mirrors, chandeliers, and museum paintings depicts this restaurant with a nice charm of a estate residence.  The outside of the restaurant does not promeniently display the restaurant's name which adds to my admiration for being discreet.  No flashy signage.  Waiting time for a table is moderate but my party of three was promptly seated and immediately serviced.  The shrimp dumplings ?? (haa1 gaau2) is large filled with three shrimps per dumpling and the chicken noodle soup were solid as we ate our fill.  The rice noodle roll ??? (zyu1 coeng4*2/4 fan2) is large but with very thick skin filled with large shrimp.  The steamed meatballs ??? (ngàuh yuhk yún) were large and very filling.  There is a parking lot."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place forever...just got the take out meal but I'm quite impressed. Quality sticky rice (one of my acid test dishes) and solid all around dishes, shu-mai, har-gow (I think these are the English spellings). I believe the setting is what takes this place up a notch but I haven't seen it yet. You pay a premium for it though as dishes tend to be about 5% more than other dim sum places."}
{"text":"I actually missed this place when I drove by because it just looks like one of the houses in my neighborhood.
It was definitely not funny at the moment, because it took me forever to try to get back. 
I gotta say though, this is one interesting place. Converting a house into a restaurant provide unique challenges in delivering food to the table. It's especially true when you are serving dim sum. Due to that restriction, they weren't able to push those interesting carts around. That kinda killed the typical dim sum atmosphere a bit. The food definitely made up for the missing carts. I was told that dim sums are like this in Toronto area. I guess this is the Toronto style fusion dim sum. It's DELICIOUS. Too bad you can't find it outside of the toronto area."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner special.  Order the set dinner for 2 at $290, which comes to $340 plus 15% tip.  It was definitely a big splurge for us.  The shark fin soup and the abalone were good but we had better before at a restaurant in Vancouver and the price of that meal was much lower.   
The food and the service are quite good but I wouldn't say I was in food heaven after eating the dishes.  Overall, the restaurant didn't really make a strong impression on me.  While we were dining, the employees were moving some huge paintings inside the restaurant . It was kind of distracting.  I agree with some yelpers that this restaurant seems a bit pretentious.  Anyway, I don't think I'll come back for a 2nd dinner experience.."}
{"text":"Been here once and in my opinion, this place has one of the best dim sums in Toronto.  Brought my parents from Montreal here and they were impressed.  Very innovative they had some dishes that i have not seen before, incorporating truffles.  Wish I had taken pictures."}
{"text":"Fancy dim sum in an unusual Victorian-style building. The food is great and the service...Well...Not too bad. Expect to be spending the $$$. You only live once so I'd say to give it a try at least once. Don't think we'd go back again. Feels awkward to park amongst the Benzes and Bimmers."}
{"text":"Casa Imperial is a dim sum restaurant inside this giant old Victorian style house.  

It's a fancy decorated place (tall ceiling, British style decor).  Which is weird when you are here for dim sum.  

Anyway, dim sum is good here, big variety.  Price is a little steep tho."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dimsum around noon or a bit later. When we got here, we were asked to wait because the place was full, but after a few minutes we were seated downstairs and given their menus as well as a slip of paper where you check off what you want. 

Our food started coming out promptly. I'll start with the favorites. I'll start with our favorite, a shark fin and seafood soup (don't remember the exact name.) The seafood was fresh and the soup complimented it well. The siu mai was big and delicious! Next is the super har gao. The shrimp inside was good and har gao itself was pretty big. The seafood dumpling and conch was very good, you should definitely try that! 

Here are the okays. There's nothing wrong with them, but at the same time they taste pretty standard. First was our beef tripe in XO sauce, which tasted okay. Nothing special. Same goes for their spare ribs with taro in black bean sauce. The jumbo shrimp and chives steamed noodle was okay, but the jumbo shrimp lives up to it's name. I didn't try the baked abalone and chicken pie, but my boyfriend said it was okay. By then I was already too full to eat it. 

Finally, when it was time for dessert, we ordered a mango pudding (which we checked off when we first ordered.) However, they forgot about that ordered so we waited until finally we mentioned it and it came out not too long after. It came out in a shape of a fish and there were two of them as well. It was pretty delicious. This was the only bad incident of our meal and I guess since it was dessert after all, they focused on all the other foods first and forgot to bring it, but it was no big deal since they handled the situation well.

Overall, I would come here again.The portions are pretty generous compared to a lot of other dimsum places, but it is a bit pricier as well. It came out to be $61 before tax for 9 dishes so almost $7 a dish. But I guess it's worth the treat once in a while."}
{"text":"This place serves authentic dim sum! The venue is quite interesting because it appears the owners turned a mansion into a restaurant. You can't go wrong by dining here. Definitely another great find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Prior to visiting Toronto I narrowed my search down to two spots for dim sum and was not let down with my choice to dine at Casa Imperial. They offer really good dim sum.  Although the restaurant interior decoration doesn't match the theme, the food really stood out.  I liked the fact that it wasn't overly noisy and you can book tables in advance. You can actually carry a conversation without yelling. Each dish had vibrant flavor and high quality ingredients. Would definitely come back for more the next time I'm in town. They had great service but my experience maybe bias since I speak Cantonese. 

Dishes that I loved: salty yolk fried sesame ball, milky tart, & the Chinese donut rice wrapped roll."}

Reservations recommended

This restaurant is a landmark. Located at Steeles and Warden, most people will know this place by description as that house turned restaurant although I suspect few people have eaten there. I'm guessing because the pricing is a bit too \"aspirational\" and I haven't heard many verbal recommendations for this place.

Went there recently for dinner. The food served is good quality Chinese food and they certainly get points for presentation (Chinese food in Toronto is generally very good, with little or no attention put into how it's served). For instance, Casa Imperial had the most well presented seafood bird's nest dish I've ever seen (a personal favourite dish of mine). However, considering this is Toronto there are a plethora of much cheaper, much better alternatives.

The old Victorian paintings on the wall make this place feel like Hong during the peak of British colonialism. They also try to imitate European/French style serving (meals portioned out, ladies first from the left) as much as they can, which is a bit awkward given that Chinese meals are generally more \"family style\". They get points for attention to detail, but it feels like a clumsy imitation. Other than feigned attempt at European style serving, it certainly has all the hallmarks of a typical Chinese restaurant waitstaff.

Not sure which demographic this serving style is supposed to appeal to but there seems to be a disconnect between the food and the atmosphere. Normally, that's not a big deal, but the price seems to reflect the opinion that there is an unwarranted premium associated with that. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's somehow expensive for a dim sum place. However you get what you pay for. Best atmosphere I've experienced for dim sum! Everything, from cups to chairs are absolute stunning. I recommend the taro dumpling and the papaya and milk puff!! The puffs ended our meal nicely!"}
{"text":"I have been to LA, SAN FRAN, VANCOUVER, NEW YORK, and HONG KONG. 

This by far is the best dim-sum I have ever had in north america, this place can even compete with hong kong dim sum.  If you are looking for dim sum this is place is a MUST! 

Mind you the prices might be a tad higher, but DEFINITELY worth it."}
{"text":"As its lovely, historic exterior suggests, Casa Imperial was a mansion-turned-fine-dining-mecca called Devonsleigh Place just a few years ago. 

Now, it's a satisfying dim sum destination. While the Victorian-era decor clashes with the Chinese-imperial-old-school style, it's an interesting and impressive exercise in re-purposing, and offers a 'special occasion' atmosphere. No rolling carts - just written orders, as is the case with many dim sum places now. (I miss them, actually.)

Lotus leaf sticky rice, har gow, siu mai, shrimp rice roll...I tried most of the dim sum classics. A little on the oilier side, but tasty. The servings were four per order in most cases. Chili sauce, sriracha, soya, hot mustard all accompanied our dishes. Standard dim sum flavours achieved. 

Enjoyed the hot & sweet almond milk, and egg custards for dessert. The service was a tad distracted (place was quite busy), but ok. With so many dim sum restaurants in Markham and north Scarborough - casual, trendy, super banquet-style fancy - Casa Imperial falls somewhere in the middle. All in all, a good visit. Not rave-worthy, but fits the bill for a hungry family weekend outing."}
{"text":"First time here, decided to give it a try. First impression was the decor was kind of weird. The inside was really antique Victorian kind of style, but they served Chinese Dim sum. The dinnerware kind of tried to match the decor, but they used old style bamboo steamers. I thought that since they were fine cuisine, that maybe they would use something more fancy. 

As for the food, the food was quite good, full of flavour. I did order 2 fancy dishes. One was Siu Mai with Dried Scallops on top and Abalone Scallop Shrimp Steamed Dumplings. Both were really good.

There was a duck meat and pickled mustard veggie dumpling that we ordered. But it was stuck to the plate and hard to scoop up. Taste was so-so.

Also ordered regular stuff like deep fried squid tentacles, chicken feet with black bean sauce, and turnip cake, they were good in flavour."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum, loved everything. Recommend the bok choy, it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fancy and overpriced dim sum. You have to wait a really long time. I went on a Sunday with my family and we waited nearly two hours.

The ambiance is really nice though. There's a Victorian theme. Teacups are very cute & pretty. 

The food was interesting. I wouldn't say it's more delicious than other dim sum restaurants in the area. However, the chefs add more high quality ingredients to each dish (i.e. abalone or scallops)."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for dim sum, but your wallet will be lighter when you leave. 

But if money is no problem for you, or you live for food, then this is the place for you! It also gets really busy on weekends for lunch, but if you know someone on the staff, then they can get you a table faster. Excellent dim sum, and good selection of fried rice/noodles and vegetables (if you like vegetables LOL) that will leave you satisfied and coming back for more."}
{"text":"This place is the embodiment of Chinese extra-ness and I love it. The restaurant is literally inside a old mansion! The servers wear maid/butler outfits while serving you some of the finest dim sum in the country. Dim sum is good (but also pricey) and thus wait times can get long. Make sure you go early!"}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum. It was my first and I haven't tried any of their main dishes, but as far as the dim sum was concerned, it was great. 

The aesthetics of the restaurant were nice, not too extraordinary. 

The staff members seemed a little impatient. 

Overall, I had a good experience and would come back again."}
{"text":"I always stop here for dim sum on a visit home. Eat dumplings in style in an old-school mansion."}
{"text":"This place is actually like a historical landmark, a converted colonial mansion turned steakhouse, turned dim sum/Chinese fine dining (may be some more steps in between).

Dinner tonight was a 10 course meal: roast piglet, shark fin soup, chicken + shrimp stir fry, abalone, chicken, vegetables, lobster, fish, rice, noodles and dessert. Service tonight, as always, was really good. With the set course meals, they change your plate after every meal, and the waiters are walking around to refill your drink. Food was tasty and like any good Chinese dinner, left me stuffed to the brim by the end. I was a fan of the dessert which was included a deep fried red bean pastry thing."}
{"text":"Been here last year for a regular dinner with XO.  We were not interested in ordering fin soup and abalone, so the set dinners were unsuitable.  As such, the menu was very inadequate.  What we ended up ordering tasted good.  Pricing aside, I will not return to have a routine dinner.  The restaurant does not seems to be interested in serving routine weekend family dinner that does not involve fin soup and abalone."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever. Had to wait over an hour for a table and the food was not worth the wait.  We aren't coming back"}
{"text":"Beautiful old manor turning out delicious dim sum. Grandeur, crystal chandeliers and a sense of coziness greet you inside, making this a great place to bring guests.

From the chicken feet to the dumplings, the dim sum doesn't disappoint!

Just know that the wait to get a table can sometimes be excruciating!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch/dinner.  Each time I was impressed by the food, the decor, and the service.  The restaurant is actually an old mansion on Steeles Ave.  I drove by not being able to find the place a few times because the entrance is so hidden.

Whether it's dim sum, seafood, or peking duck, you can't go wrong here.  Prices are on the high end but you get what you pay for.  

Recommended to anyone looking for upscale chinese food in Markham."}
{"text":"Food:  4 stars
Ambience:  3 stars  
Service:  1.5 stars
Care for patrons:  0 star  (I will explain this later)

I finally got around to visiting Casa Imperial for a Monday afternoon dim sum.  I was hoping to host a party here for my daughter's first birthday for 50+ guests and needed to check it out before sending out RSVPs.  Since I did not want to schlep out to Markham with an 11 month old in tow, I called them with some basic questions first.  In this phone inquiry, I was told that their \"private dining room\" could accomodate 50+ guests.  A BIG FAT LIE.  Yes, they have a small private dining room but it can barely seat 25 guests comfortably.  Instead, we were told upon arrival that that they could make the entire 2nd flr available for us which opens to the rest of the dining area.  This is not the same as having your own room where your event can be closed off to the rest of the restaurant.  I did not appreciate that they were outright deceitful over the phone to get me to come in to their restaurant and they did not hesitated to do this when I told them that I would be coming in with a small baby.  This is the short explanation for the 0 star for \"care for patrons\" rating above.  Oh yeah, that and their laughable \"change table\" for my little one.  Anyone interested in exploring this further, you can send me a message.

So here we were.  4 adults and a baby (11 months old) on a Monday afternoon...arriving around 11:30 and the parking lot was packed!  Already a bad sign.  I'm sure they will not have adequate parking available for my party guests on a Saturday if the place is this jammed on a Monday.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was not amused to see the once beautiful Devonsleigh Place turned into this garish operation.  Gone were the old world charm and understated opulence of the former restaurant and what I found in its place was an ill-fitting juxtaposition of a noisy, wanna-be-high end Chinese restaurant.  All the servers were dressed in formal attire in attempt to convey attention to detail and class but they did not know how to address guests properly and this became painfully evident when we had to ask for a high chair twice and still wait some 15 min to get it.  And to top it all off, they sat us at the farthest corner of the second floor dining room when they could clearly see that my mother in law was walking with a cane.  Sigh....

Between the 4 adults, we tried a healthy variety of dishes off their dim sum menu and I must say, the food was good.  Here is a quick run down of our food experience:  Shark's fin soup tad too salty for my taste, Beef shumai moist and well seasoned, Steamed chicken with black fungus and orange daylily was one of our favorites with juicy (but boney) morsels of well seasoned chicken cooked in lotus leaf.  Chicken feet, baked abalone & chicken pie, crispy taro dumpling, crispy bean curd roll, fried turnip cake were all good, as expected.  However, the tripe was too chewy and tough.  Perhaps my favorite thing about their dim sum was the milk and papaya puff.  These cute flaky pastry beauties held creamy, milky custard filling studded with pieces of papaya.  I almost wanted to order more to bring them home.  All this came to $75 including tax and tip.   Not bad at all.  

After a mixed dining experience of good food and bad everything else, I have decided that Casa Imperial is not where I would like to have my daughter's first birthday after all.  I can put up with bad service if I'm on my own but I refuse to subject my guests to it and Casa Imperial's laughable \"change table\" for my guests with babies.  As for  vising Casa Imperial again, sure....I would drop in if I'm back in the area but I will not go out of my way to eat there any time soon.

When I called the restaurant to let them know that I will not be holding my party there, the manager (older Chinese gentleman whose name I will not mention here) was extremely rude on the phone.  His exact response was, \"whatever, I don't care\" before promptly hanging up on me without even asking why.  If Casa Imperial really wants to be high end, they have a lot to learn about genuinely caring for their patrons and providing much better service than just putting on a uniform and buying a Victorian mansion."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Sunday morning at around 10:30am. I thought there would be a lineup but luckily there were a few tables available. When we left at around 11:45am there was a line up. My recommendations: come early on weekends at 9am to 10:30am or arrive late at about 1:00pm or just don't bother coming at all. The parking lot is small for a dim sum place and the wait can be long if you come during peak times.

Inside is beautifully decorated. There are no words to describe and probably the nicest looking dim sum restaurant you can find in the area. 

Service was excellent and really fast. Right after we placed our order we started getting food within 5 minutes or less. Empty dishes were cleared up fast and teapots refilled quickly. 

Price is higher than the typical dim sum restaurant but its well worth it. There is no price listed on the menu and did not see any mention of early bird specials so I am assuming there is no early bird special. But based on the items we ordered: Small (S) = $3.10, Medium (M) = $4.10
Large (L) = $5.10

I usually don't review every item at a dim sum restaurant but with this place I think its worth mentioning. So here it goes.....

Tea is charged at $1.30 per person :(

1) Siu Mai ($5.10) - four super large pieces. I usually shove the whole thing in my mouth but these were so large I could not do so without looking like a pig. 

2) Scallop and spinach dumpling ($5.10) - three pieces only. Good amount of scallops. 

3) Chicken feet ($4.10) - oh so yummy. The sauce it was cooked in was done just the way I like. A hint of sweetness.

4) Papaya custard layer cake ($4.10) - soft and fluffy

5) Crispy sesame ball with egg yolk custard ($5.10) - nice and runny egg yolk custard

6) Crispy whole shrimp ($5.10) - shrimps were deep fried with a light flaky outer shell. Giant sized shrimps. Came with a mayo type dipping sauce which I could just put on anything and it would taste good.

7) Cuttlefish tentacles ($5.10) - cooked perfectly just the way I like. You can see the caramelization of the sauce on the tentacles. A hint of sweetness. The best and just as good as the ones I had at Yang's Fine Chinese Cuisine. 

8) Ham sui gok ($3.10) - deep fried outer shell was nice and crispy. The inside was soft and had huge chunks of pork meat.

9) Shrimp rice roll ($5.10) - silky smooth, soft rice rolls with giant sized shrimps.

10) Pumpkin and chestnut congee $5.10 - not too watery and not too thick but done just right. Love the addition of chestnuts in the congee.

I can say with confidence that this is probably the best money can buy in terms of dim sum. The only complaint I can find is that I wish they had more items on the menu like more variety on steamed buns. And I wish they had tofu fa (aka sweet tofu pudding). Everything tasted great. Everything tasted fresh. The ingredients they use are obviously higher quality. The only average dishes in my opinion were the papaya custard cake and the sesame ball with egg yolk. Even though they were only average to me, they were by no means a bad dish.

I see a lot of mixed reviews here and even my favourite reviewer Jennifer K. only gave it a 2.5 stars but that was a while ago so things may have changed since then. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Another Dim Sum review haha.

Came here today for lunch. It's similar to Crown Prince in it's extravagant decor and IMO, over-the-top service (ie, who needs to change plates that often?).

Anyways, the most important thing is the food for me. The Dim Sum is quite good. The Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) are interesting in that unlike normal Har Gow where it's one shrimp per dumpling, they kind of make a puree out of it and then fill it in a dumpling, just to make it bigger than a typical Har Gow. The Siu Mai (pork and mushroom dumpling) are also huge. Personally, it's a lot harder to eat in one bite, so for that reason I prefer the traditional bite-sized ones! Other than that, everything is quite good. 

Wasn't the one treating today, so I can't comment on the value - but it is definitely not within my meagre student budget!"}
{"text":"I have never step foot into such a beautiful Chinese restaurant.  As you enter their private lot, you are driving through the gates of what used to be a mansion.  When you walk into the dining room, you feel as if you're dining in a British tearoom.  The interior is adorned with beautiful paintings and chandeliers, the staff are all dressed in formal uniforms, and the utensils and plates are all very intricate.  Case in point: this is not your typical Chinese restaurant.

The dim sum, on the other hand, was kind of a miss.  My aunt and uncle kept raving about Casa Imperial's steamed dumplings.  But I think they were having an off day, as the dumpling skins crumbled between my chopsticks.  It's definitely not a good sign when you can't even take a bite out of your ha gow (shrimp dumpling) without the shrimp falling out of your dumpling skin.  But they do have other great offerings: Chinese mustard and clam congee, black pepper baby beef ribs, rice noodles, and their rice and noodle dishes.

Prices are a bit high, but I think the fabulous dining experience makes up for it.  I took a peek at their wedding banquet menu offerings and almost choked on my food.  The cheapest menu was listed at $778, while the most expensive was listed at $2288!  Regardless of the high prices, it's evident that Torontonians are a big fan of this place.  I came here at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and there was still a wait for a table!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the more fancy/upscale Chinese dim sum cuisines. The restaurant is in a mansion, yes that's right - a mansion. Though it is more 'upscale' than your regular dim sum restaurants, it is merely reflected in its pricing and decor. There doesn't seem to be any dress code; just dress casually. The food was delicious, though I felt that it wasn't anything I couldn't have gotten at other dim sum restaurants. Service was alright. Food came out in a timely manner, even though we went during peak lunch time hours on Family Day, and the place was PACKED with other diners. 

Note: If you're planning on splitting the bill, they only allow it to be split into two bills max."}
{"text":"Crying because can't explain how much I love dim sum. The service is fast the food is nice be sure to arrive early because you may have to wait"}
{"text":"Food Quality: 4/5
Service: 1/5
Parking: 2/5
Dining Area: 5/5
Value: 3/5

This place is quite pretentious and obviously for those who want to be seen.  It is NOT a place you go to with close friends or family for a relaxed time.  The staff were rude and the price insane for the portion size.  For a special occasion?  Maybe."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Stunning atmosphere!! Feels so elegant. Roomy seating.
We usually come here when another suggested to try a \"hot spot dim sum\" and turns out to be a 45min wait.
Come here and not wait. Kids love it. Its just a bit more $$, but you are paying to have a relaxing atmosphere.  Food is good.  It does get busy during prime time.

I enjoy having dim sum here."}
{"text":"My fiance's family and I came here for our last dim sum brunch before catching our flight back to NYC. My fiance's dad had his company's  holiday banquet here. Very elegant, grand interior. A huge crowd was waiting to be called when we arrived. Fortunately, we had a reservation and were seated immediately. The dim sums here were exactly the same as Crown Prince maybe a few extra item here and there. Something new that we tried were lamb dumplings (not a big fan), durian rolls (no one in my party dared to touch them.. all for me yay lol), egg yolk layered cake (I love sweets but the salty part threw me off.. wasn't a big fan), taro rolls with sweet potato (too starchy), sweet potato tart (delish not too sweet! - even my fiance's brother's gf liked it and she hates sweets!) 

Definitely looking forward to return to this place for another fine dim sum dining in the future!"}
{"text":"Casa Imperial Fine Chinese Cuisine restaurant was inside a large converted mansion. Maybe it was a farmhouse before that was converted into a restaurant. The restaurant was nicely decorated and very beautiful. We have to wait 20 minutes before we got a table.

The food was very good, but very expensive. We have Taro Dumpling, Super Har Gow, Glutin Rice. etc. Each dish cost between $3 to $7.80.

The service was very nice and we received the food very quickly.

Would we go back? Maybe, it was hard to find parking and we had to wait a long time to get a table."}
{"text":"No one likes overpriced food but sometimes you just have to pay to try out new things.  Honestly, Chinese cuisine is generally not expensive, the reason is because throughout the world in many many countries, Chinese cuisine exists in a lot of places- there are trends of the chinese 'takeout' or 'fast food' or 'cheap eats'.  So we have typically grown accustomed to that notion of the inexpensive category in eating that has so much flavor and \"heat/fire\" without the big bucks.  However, of course there will be renditions or spin-offs where people will turn it around and then charge big bucks.  I am not against that type of transformation at all.  It's like turning ratatouille into a $100 dish but it was always known as the poor person's food.  Or if you go to Harlem to pay $30 for fried chicken because this restaurant decided to make it a delicacy.  But you see - these are just new ways that restaurants evolve their food/service/theme. This is just a background scenario to lead into Casa Imperial.  A house that was renovated into a dining hall - that resembles a catering hall for wedding venues.  

In any case, this is probably one of the finest dimsum places that I have ever tried.  The quality and overall dishes are superb.  I've had excellent and FRESH dimsum in San Franscisco, Hong Kong and Guangzhou.  Fresh is not only referring to the basic ingredients but fresh in how it's made, when it's made.   So for example, fresh, in my definition entails as soon as you bite into the noodle part of a shrimp wrapped noodle, the noodle part of it has a slight al dente bouncey texture that goes to show that they made it on the spot.  If that dish was made a few hours ago, the noodles would've hardened up.  so it's really made right when you order.  For those who have tried abalone - an expensive seafood, there is a abalone mini pies (very expensive!!!)  

Weekends - expect AT LEAST an hour's wait.  Almost everyone accepts that wait - and no one complains.  So it's a pleasant wait :) for everybody!  (a rarity that happens in good ole' NYC!)

With the decor, plate settings and atmosphere - FORGET about it, the photos all speak for themselves.  It was not only breath-taking but astonishly elegant and over-the-top - a hint of old-Italian culture, mixed with Versaille elements, alongside some antiquity nostalgia.  At the same time, it is SO CLEAN.  The plates, settings, cups and tablescapes were all organized neatly...which is is why I'm saying to forget talking about it.. it's just too perfect. 

Again, this is the best of the best in dimsum.  It is comparable to what I think are the world's top dimsum places in HK, Guangzhou and San Fran, U.S.  I have yet to try the dimsum in Vancouver."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is delicious but oily with plenty choices of congee and high quality tea, the price is fair and costs us 25-30$ per person, I give 3 star for this cause I don't know why it DOESN'T offer salted egg custard bun. (It's one of my favourite dishes)"}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Chinese fine dining restaurant.  You have to know what to order to suit your palate.  Do not expect superb service like other non Chinese fine dining places because that's the Chinese way.  This is very good service for Chinese food standards.  My go to place for Dim Sum, packed with long line ups.  If you are in this side of town, you have to give them a try."}
{"text":"This not stand out for me ????? ????, ????.                  I like the ????,  ?????????  Better services quality .   ?? ???. ????, ???? ???."}
{"text":"As had many yelpers have reviewed the interior is Wow . They've wisely turned this old house into a European restaurant with Big paintings and dropping chandeliers.  The food however is a a far cry from their beautiful interiors. Unfortunately interiors can't be eaten. I would come back to try their dimsum at some point sure why not, but the place would not meet my go-to place / comfort food."}
{"text":"I've been there for several times when it's just open, but haven't been there again for years till someone my MIL knows start working in this restaurant.  For sure the atmosphere is quite nice for a dim sum restaurant, but the price is more expensive compare to same area dim sum places.  Food overall is ok, but not impressive.  Last time I ordered a pear shape dessert and it was so oily that I really couldn't finish it......Based on the food quality and price, I think there's alot dim sum places better than Casa.

If u go there during weekend lunch hour, definitely need to wait at least 1/2 to an hr unless u know someone works there......."}
{"text":"I just finished an incredible dim sum in a large house. The long (1.5 hours on a Saturday vs my expected 1 hour) wait foretold the sumptuous meal; wait time for a table is far shorter on weekdays. Huge and tender shrimps/scallops were in all the dishes. Congee was piping hot and as good, possibly better, than I have tasted in a restaurant.  The sui mai & cheung foon were fantastic. Har gow was very good. Service was prompt and efficient (after the long wait). Excellent decor & very clean."}
{"text":"Since dim sum experience is ok here so we decided to hold a small wedding reception here for family members who cannot attend on the big day.

DO NOT HOLD A RECEPTION OR PRIVATE EVENT HERE, REASONS:  
The staff didn't seem to have much experience about event here, they put some big noisy tables right outside our blocked area, when the kids from those tables ran into our area they didn't do anything to stop them. I told the staff to take some control when it first happened, but nothing was done and it kept happening through out the night.  

The last names was peeling off on the wall, even with tapes and pins on, it's obvious and looking ugly on my photos. 

There are 12 dishes on their menu, the skipped one of my dish. Food was served too fast at the beginning, they came out one after one, we have to tell them to slow down.  Food are not great, disappointing with the price we paid.

Set up was so packed, barely any space for you to take photos, they solution is to move away the tables for you to take photos, that means it has to be after dinner and at that time they are rushing for cleaning and closing.

Worst - when I complained to the manager after the event, he argued and maintained these are not much of a problem. 
 
On the day of the event you don't have time to tell them how to make things right one by one, better off go to a place where they know how to provide a great experience."}
{"text":"Too pricey for me and I don't think the price is justified. My friend loves the unique dishes though but if you want a high end place to drink tea then definitely this is a place you can choose. 

Sometimes the wait can be long cause I am sure there are people taking advantage of being regulars there."}
{"text":"Overall, the experience we had here was quite extraordinary considering service at some other dim sum places. 

We were promptly seated and given a dim sum menu upon request. The food came out with outstanding presentation. The food not only looked good, but it also tasted good. 

My highlight dish would have to be the steamed shrimo har gow. Wow, could a bite get any more succulent and flavorful?

The meal was truly a great experience."}
{"text":"Don't bother making a reservation because it means nothing here.  It's strictly first come seat whoever they want.  The food is great but they need to work on the reservations.  Either don't take reservations at all or respect them."}
{"text":"This place sets dim sum standards. It used to be an fancy white restaurant, but then the asians took over. Brap brap!! But, do not fear 'cause the food is really good here. No lie. 

Man, I remember coming here when it first opened and their menu was most likely last-minute without spell check edited by an 80 yr old china man straight off the boat. I'd always get a good laugh at that. NO worries though, the menu has been edited with almost no or little errors now.

But on to the show stopper, the head knocker or the drool starter..? FOOD. DIM SUM. The works. These guys set the standard for asian dim sum. Seriously, everything has their own distinct flavour that is just delicious. The BBQ pork has some pinenuts which is different and tastes amazing. Flaky, flavourful, and piping hot. Also the clam congee is SO good. The congee absorbs the flavour of the clams and vegetable ingredients and just makes it taste so fresh and gives it a natural sweet flavour. Amazing. Also, their pan-fried sticky rice has SO much ingredients it's crazy. Each bite will leave you a variety of either sausage, mushroom, green onion, etc. These guys do not cheap out. ALMOST FORGOT, order the mango dessert if they have it, (Menu sometimes changes) it's so fuckin' good. Chewy texture with fresh mango taste. 

The service here is great. But then again, we've been here since it opened so like any asian place if you're a regular, you will get genuine smiles, immediate discounts and attentive staff. But, I remember the staff were always very nice.

Overall:   You get the idea."}
{"text":"love this place.. but wait time can be crucial during peak hours (noon-2ish) best sticky rice!!!!! and its pretty inside, been here prob a dozen times already, and i recommend it if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED AND MEDIOCRE DIM SUM!!! And that's not even the worst part! If you're not a regular customer or dress like you own a gold mine, you'll be snubbed by pretty much all the staff there. Chinese restaurants aren't generally known for their table service and I walked in not expecting much, but they were full out rude. 

I'll admit I wasn't dressed my best (but I did just get off a night shift) and the hostess looked like she didn't even want to give us a table. The dim sum on the menu were all pretty pricey (expected) but when I tried them, I knew I just got ripped off. 

The place started getting busy since it was a Saturday. They cleared our table and took our utensils as soon as we finished our food and handed us the bill! Felt like they just wanted to get rid of us. They looked annoyed when we wanted to pay by credit card too.

Overall, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Would not come back even if I could eat for free."}
{"text":"Honestly, from some of the Chowhound comments, I was expecting much more from this place.  In all fairness, the Dim Sum here is not that great.  Considering the higher pricing charged \"relatively speaking\", it should have been better.  There were 8 dishes ordered, not one made my cut as being exceptional or uniquely different from the rest.  The flour used on the wrapping/skin is not high quality flour since I am somewhat gluten sensitive and the food here triggered it.  Decor, just plain awful, not that Asians care much about decor, it's always about the food and maybe the service for promptness/friendliness/courtesy.  Conclusion, there is nothing awful here BUT just nothing w/ a \"WOW\" factor, you know what I mean.  In my opinion, the best Chinese/Dim Sum in Toronto was the year 2004, summer months, Golden Court in Markham.   Anyone who had the good fortune to dine there during that glorious time would know what I mean by a great Chinese restaurant in all aspects from early morning Dim Sum thru late night snack/dinner, w/o skipping a beat.  I really miss that..."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and decor(although somewhat clashy), fast service, big although still overpriced portions, delicious scallops and shrimp, the fried rice wrapped in lotus leaves was very good(one of the best I've eaten), and I liked the complimentary red bean soup too (in Cantonese they say \"sugar water\") and the cookies. Food is kinda overpriced though, we got 2 of the cheapest dishes because the others were like $60-$120 each what. The food was nice but not worth that much c'mon. Seriously, there were combos for 2 valued at $240 or something. Even if you're rich there are better places to spend your money.

It was 9pm and I just wanted to go to a random dim sum place that was nearby and open. No all day dim sum here :/ but the place was really fancy-looking. First thing my bf said when we went inside, \"Why are there white people paintings?\" (since it was a Chinese restaurant). I thought it was weird too since there were Chinese decor up too; found out later that it used to be an Italian restaurant. 
So, it took about 2 minutes for us to get seated. I noticed that there were at least 4 floors and many rooms. I really liked that we were seated in a small room with only one other group because I don't like big crowded places. I did all the talking because I spoke Cantonese and my bf didn't. We got our tea and and our food quite fast. They served us our fried rice and noodles into small bowls in front of us and we had the option of getting the free red bean soup which I took. It tasted really good with the cookies and was just the right amount of sweetness for my Chinese tastebuds. I didn't expect much from a place rated 3.5 stars, but I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this restaurant does not serve dim sum in the evenings.. We went there and ordered three dishes the lemon chicken, beef with green pepper in black bean sauce, and a house fried rice after waiting approximately 25 minutes we asked the waiter what was taking so long and it was obvious that somebody had screwed up in the kitchen and we didn't get our order. So we just got up and left. For such a fancy looking place they really can't step up when it comes to serving dishes on time. Also this place is very expensive. For a simple house rice it would have cost almost 20 bucks. In a way, their screw up was technically a blessing in disguise for us as we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Crap crap crap crap!  And scam galore!

This used to be my favourite hangout but today they charged me the following compulsory charges:

1.  Tea (we don't drink tea)
2.  Tablecloth surcharge (really?)
3.  Sauce surchage (their excuse is because the food we ordered have sauce in it)

Oh, and now their food is MSG galore!"}
{"text":"Very good, actually. I love that the entire place feels like an old manor or mansion, that the service was attentive, that the vibe was so mellow. Plentiful parking is a good thing too.

Some dishes were outstanding... the sui mai, har gow, cha shu bao. Some were just so-so. The curried baby octopus wasn't a homerun for me. But generally the portions were generous, the flavors spot-on, and the presentation aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"2.5 Star

I remember the days that Casa Imperial used to be a Classy Restaurant where my dates took me here for a nice and quiet meals of Seafood Platter for 2 and Steak.... those were the days.

Casa Imperial is trying hard to be classy and high end with a price to match but I feel it is just falling short... fail in every aspect, especially on my first and most recent visit.

A recent Conditional Pass from DineSafe:

Casa Imperial Fine Chinese Cuisine (4125 Steeles Ave East)
Inspected on: November 4, 2013 
Inspection finding: Yellow (Conditional)
Number of infractions: 11 (Minor: 5, Significant: 6)
Crucial infractions include: N/A

No service in their so call \"VIP\" room on a weekday! With no one checking on us to see if our teapots were empty and were understaffed with no wait staff in sight to do any refills.

Dim Sum tasted pretty good but a place that pride themselves as fine dining, their dim sum seems to be just slapped together with not much care. 

We shared:

??????? Baked BBQ Pork & Pine Seed Puff (L) - A-OK
????? Baked Abalone & Chicken Pie (SP) -A-OK
????????? Crispy Shrimp Peach Roll w/Salad Dressing (M) - A-OK
????? Super Har Gow Jumbo Shrimp Dumpling (XL) -A-OK
????? Milk & Papaya Puff (M) -A-OK
???????? BBQ Duck & Cabbage Dumpling w/Conch (L) -A-OK
???????  Braised Ox Tail in Satay Sauce (XL)- FAIL as Ox Tail was still tough

Almost all the items on the menu aside from 4 are Medium and above..with a XL for $7.10 and SP for $8.10. As this price point, I should have a high expectation?!

For the dim sum experience, Casa Imperial was Meh unless you don't mind being ignored all these time while the managers busy socializing with the regulars and with dim sum slamming down on your table..."}
{"text":"Pricey for dim sum but so worth the large portions and freshness!!! Although despite the reservation we had we still waited FOREVER!"}
{"text":"It's a great dim sum place that a little bit on the expensive side. The decor doesn't really match but creates a comfortable environment. Space is a bit cramped but acceptable. Food wise it's pretty good and tastes pretty fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow...almost any and everything is delectable and discernibly better than dim sum in NYC. Could be the high concentration of southern Chinese ppl in this area. Most notable, were the birds nest egg tarts. Who even comes up with that? I don't care but thank you sir/ ma'am so dam much. They were hot, delicate and melt in your mouth not unlike cotton candy on a crispy airy phyllo shell. We ordered about 3 dozen for 7 people, because when it's that good, you just have to have 5 each."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the FANCIEST Chinese restaurant I've ever been in, and I've been to quite a lot. Though, a word of warning, if you want to sit on the 2nd floor area for dinner, be prepared to pay an extra $2 CAD per dish. While the upper area is nice, I would only suggest doing that for special guests. Otherwise, sit in the lower area when possible.

The food was good, not death-defying incredible, but good. I would give it 3 stars for the food, but 5 stars for the presentation of the food, so it rounds out for 4-star food.

The place definitely deserves a 5 star because it is the cleanest, and best looking Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Bravo!

The service was top-notch. The staff took care of us late into closing time (we were the last people there). 

The price was definitely high up there. EEEXXXPENSIVE! But, you need to give it a go.

All in all, I would recommend this spot , but with a few warnings before stepping in."}
{"text":"We learned about this place from various websites, journals, and newspapers.  We came here last week for lunch.  This place is near the Pacific Mall.  The restaurant is in a historical building, but the place is sort of run down, and the decor is a bit dated.  There was a long line around lunch time, and we had to wait about 30 minutes before getting seated.  We should've made a reservation.  The food is a bit pricey, if not over priced, and you are paying for the location, nice dinning set, and the linen.  We give this place two stars for the elaborate service.  We had a server taking our orders, and then, there is a server for serving the dim sum from the carrier's dim sum tray.  We had a different server to portion the soup, Cantonese noodles, and other dishes.  Between each dishes, they refreshed our plates.  Pretty elaborate.  However, no stars for the food.   Everything we ordered were either stales, lukewarm, under-seasoned or over-seasoned.  Cantonese noodles were too dry and the taro was too soggy.  We've had dim sum at other places.  We chalked our visit as an experience and we probably won't be back next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I mean, I totally get the appeal of eating at a pseudo high-class Chinese diner; given the expansion of the nouveau-rich in the region, understandably they need somewhere to match their tastes with their bank accounts. But Casa does little to help with the variety of restaurants in the area, other than to offer an architectural anomaly in an area of fenced residential housing. 

I come here with family maybe once or twice a month for casual weekend lunches and we order dim sum staples like siu mai, shrimp dumpling etc, and fried rice/noodle dishes as well. In efforts to elevate their dishes, an overabundance of luxurious ingredients is abusively and needlessly showered like blessings of golden rain over items on the menu.  A regular fresh, nicely steamed pork bun would have suffice, but for a dollar more we'll give you an extra bang for your buck and squeeze in some abalone sauce just so your superficial mind will be satisfied instead of your taste buds. 

Given their attempt at preserving the original structure of the mansion, the general architecture of the building is very unwelcoming. The twists and corners, and scattering of smaller \"rooms\" make the space confusing and difficult to navigate at times. The layout lacks cohesion; different  parts of the restaurant have clashing interior fittings. Staff service is adequate and polite as expected of this price level, but the waiting staff seem stiff and non-conversational. 

Social status and classiness aside, it's a regular restaurant with regular food designed perfectly for the shallow wannabe-upper class, and the rich that is too lazy to operate their Cayenne's GPS. This place is a try-hard haute Chinese cuisine that fails to deliver much more value than the tasteless and gaudy decor. I've never eaten wallpaper; maybe it does taste different here?"}
{"text":"Our friends took us here for some victorian  dimsum. We had quite a long wait which i assume is typical here. definitely not your average dimsum crowd. The waiters and waitresses were in maid and butler outfits, the brick outside made it feel as though you were entering some estate and the interior matched the charm. Easily a $100+ dimsum meal for 4, the food was tasty and I guess you're paying for the experience."}
{"text":"Minus one star for the wait - waited  1.5 hour on a Sat for 3 ppl because the VIP customers had priority in seatings, which was VERY unfair and you could've done it in non-so-obvious way....

Minus another star - poor service. It would be nice if the waiter would show some expression or at least nod to acknowledge when you ask for a missing dim sum. Cute french maid outfit for the servers, but the waiters need to work on customer service.

LOVE THE DIM SUM - pretty pricey for 3 ppl ($80)

Favorite: Everything was delicate and nicely done
Stir fried clams with pork meat
5 spiced cuttlefish tentacles
Deep fried dough with conpoy
Sticky rice and chicken in lotus leaf
Giant shu mai

Disappoint/ expect better: mango pudding and the bird nest egg tart.

One of my favorite DIM SUM place in toronto"}
{"text":"Dim sum at Casa Imperial is always a delight, save for the price. The wait is always long, so either come super early, super late, or make a reservation. 

Now onto the food!

Honey sesame pan fried short rib- last time I ordered this, it was a tad chewy. This time, it was perfect! I couldn't stop eating it! 

Crispy shrimp won ton in sweet and sour sauce: this was good, but not spectacular. Kind of reminds me of the shrimp rolls that I always get at Ambassador, since the dipping sauce is almost identical. But the shrimp rolls were more whimsical and fun.

Har Gow- can't go to dim sum without ordering this, and these were quite delicious.

Pan fried chives and conpoy dumpling: I really enjoyed these dumplings, as they were very juicy and full of aromatic chives! 

Deep fried dough with rice noodle roll: always a favourite of mine. This time, the deep fried dough was super crunchy, even more than usual. Perhaps they were over-fried? Regardless, I loved the addition of conpoy. The dipping sauces, however, were rather bland.  

For dessert, milk and papaya puff: the pastry was delicate and flaky, and the rich cream filling was quite wonderful.

It was another wonderful dim sum experience at Casa Imperial. I wish they have some sort of early bird special though."}
{"text":"Food is great quality and the service is the absolute best you'll find at any fine Chinese dining restaurant, no question. Only thing is the prices are high, but you get what you pay for in this case. If you're looking to have a pleasant dining experience and are willing to spend a little more, this is the place to go"}
{"text":"there are more dim-sum restaurants in toronto than there are stars in the sky.  generally, most of them are of decent quality--just a matter of how easier parking is, how long is the wait, and how much does the tab ring up in total.

we might have gone on a weekday (a year ago too, actually), or maybe it was early enough on a sunday (tourists traveling for the long weekend), so the first two aforementioned prerequisites were fulfilled w/o a hassle.

now don't be fooled by the victorian decor inside the building; this is still a chinese dim-sum place, although the tea set almost made me believe i was a guest in the buckingham palace (not that i've been... -_-). 

food is great -- not food-gasm great, but definitely above average-- and guess how much the tab rang up?  $60 for 4 of us, $15 a piece.  not bad at all for the kind of fancy-schmancy setup and a nice, quiet environment that's very different from the typical dim-sum scene.  (ok, nice and quiet until this group of noisy mid-aged ladies came in.)
:)"}
{"text":"Coming from the states it wasn't that expensive compared to most places. The atmosphere is stellar compared to a lot of places and the service is spot on. This restaurant is a Cantonese speaking restaurant and it's a big plus if you speak the language with them. 
LUNCH
We had the standard dim sum favorites of mine and my family's. One of the best parts was the shark fin dumpling soup and bird swallowing egg tart. The bird swallowing egg tart was creamy and smooth and the best egg tart I've ever tasted. It did take sometime to receive the tarts because it was made once we ordered it! All of the food is piping hot and made fresh once ordered! 
DINNER
For dinner we had the deluxe combos for one person for each of us (three in total) we got the two \"c's\" and one \"d\". Both of them had shark fin soup, but the \"c\" had much more shark fin. The service we got was first class. They poured our tea for us, removed our plates when it got dirty from the food and they kept a great eye on us and made sure we were treated well! When we ate the roasted squab (pigeon) the meat was super tender and out of the world. When we asked about the squab they said they don't use frozen food only fresh! 
OVERALL
This place may be a little expensive for people but it's worth treating yourself to this kind of service and food. If I could give it more stars I would! If I ever come back to Toronto, I will definitely be back!"}
