{"text":"This place is simply amazing. One must go here and have their unlimited thali. Food is authentic gujarati fare with lots of varieties and fresh rotis served on your table.They even serve buttermilk and also special rotis every 10 mts. Simply amazing food."}
{"text":"Not bad - but could be a lot better for the price you pay

The food is decent; atypical for ethic Gujarati fare and hence almost all main course items are tad sweet; food is served buffet style and a set menu. Service is mediocre, at best nonchalant; you get there, eat, leave, no frills. Ambience is lacking a lot; cramped and bare bones. They could do better in this dept. for what they charge. 

Go there if you must eat traditional Gujarati cuisine.  Expect nothing; and thou shall not be too disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is stale and recycled from their freezers.
We saw it being reheated and was confirmed by the lady in the kitchen.They abuse their staff in front of customers.Its so embarassing and the quality and hygiene is questionable. 
Avoidable unless you have no choice."}
{"text":"The food is served hot and fresh by a kind and friendly host. We really enjoyed our dining experience because of the tasty delicacies and piping hot rotis and puran polis. The place is small but feels cozy and warm because of the excellent hospitality."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends last night and it was great! I am not too familiar with Gujurati food but I thoroughly enjoyed it anyway (not super spicy, so just right for me).

My favourite dish was one with sweet potatoes and eggplant. I also really enjoyed a roti with sweet filling. :)"}
{"text":"The food is simply outstanding. The ladies are very friendly & hospitable. 
Hole-in-the-wall places like these have the best food. Don't look for ambience - just food. Better ventilation is needed to exhaust the cooking smells since we all got out smelling of surthi-undhiyu! The eating dishes like cups, plates could be cleaned better."}
{"text":"Pure. Gujarati. Food. 

Pretty much says it all, right? Sometimes a vegetarian buffet made to order and continually replenished is all you really need as a quick culinary introduction to Scarborough, a dynamic and growing eastern suburb of Toronto. This is an epicenter of South and East migration, and it has left an indelible and delicious imprint on the landscape. This isn't about generic \"Indian\" food: these are regional delicacies and specialty dishes: lentils, chick peas, potatoes, all sorts of rice and breads and chutneys and spinach and tomatoes and garlic and onions and the sweet smells and intoxicating aromas of spice after spice after spice ... A sensual feast for a fraction of the cost of the what you would pay in the downtown districts. 

Really, that's not a bad way to get lunch, at all. In fact, it's one of the more memorable meals out I've had in months. Served on metal trays and tiny bowls, all in a shopping district catering to the local South Asia community who are its most frequent guests.You feel right at home even if you've never been to Northwest India or tried this style of food before.

Pure. Gujarati. Food.

Try it sometime."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh, authentic Gujarati food! A number of dishes, which always provides great variety. You can pick from spicy to sweet! And of course it's super affordable! It's a small family run restaraunt, but the recent renovation and addition to the buffet has really been great! The ladies working there are very nice and helpful. 

I usually go here when I am looking for some good veggie Gujarati / Indian food. I believe you can dine in, do take out or cater from them."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely \"homely\" - the rich masalas or the heavy use of oil or color is missing and that is perhaps the reason why it's so popular. There are six ladies who manage the kitchen and the service typically depends on their mood and how exhausted they are - remember making those rotis and other curries in that small space is no joke. The place can get quite tight (especially if you are on the bigger/heavier side like me). There are about 6 tables and during peak hours, there is a line up. The food is good and that's the reason why you go there. The storage area is almost making its way to the washrooms and the kitchen area can be viewed from there - one can question the amount of hygiene they maintain. I really enjoyed my meal there and the ladies (including the daughter of the owner) were really nice to us but I would hesitate going there again during the peak hours. I am all about the great quality of food that gets the highest weightage for a Yelp review but there are other things in life too that matter! If you are visiting the place, lower your expectations. Only expect good food and nothing else and you won't be disappointed. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant to eat a Gujarati thali. The food was quite authentic. A good range of dishes also, even for a picky eater like me. And was value for money.

If you want to try Indian food but cannot take the spice, a great place to go. Would have given a higher rating if the bhaji were more moist. Otherwise would definitely recommend a try.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite south asian restaurant in Toronto.  OK in North America.  Home style Gujarati food, family style.  Tushar and Bina Shah put out the best pure veg Indian food imaginable.  Their selection is always varied, with splendid dals and vegetable dishes, and always a few sweets.   The crowning touch though are Bina's hand made breads; they really lift the experience into an ethereal realm.  Her dokha is scrumptious too."}
{"text":"This place is probably more like a 3.5 to me just based on flavor of the food, but the hospitality of the owner is incredible and he makes you feel right at home, which easily bumps my rating to a solid 4 stars. Good amount of variety on the buffet-style menu, and at a more than reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Small family joint with thali style buffet and fresh rotis of all types. The place is a bit cramped for space which is the only down side. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been several times to this restaurant having great expectations and I think my conclusion at the end is: STAY AWAY.

This is probably the only Gujarati restaurant (I am Gujarati) in Toronto at the moment. Although they may have tasty dishes at times, I would avoid for the following reasons:

1. Poor service. They don't have any servers. On a busy day, you will wait endlessly for your next 'rotli' or buttermilk and it will arrive late if you are lucky and if you are unlucky, you may wait endlessly and decide not to have any more. The owner mans the cash counter doubling up as the server, and can be very rude.

2. Freshness of food. Food at the buffet is often stale, has dried up or has hardened (take the khaman dhokla for example).

3. I have seen plates of \"khaman dhokla\" right outside the men's bathroom. No elaboration required.

4. Inhumane conditions for customers to sit in and for the poor cooks to cook in (you can see them cook in front of you). It has zero ventilation and no air-conditioning. On a hot July day around 1 pm, there were no fans turned on. At the request of a customer, the owner grudgingly turned on a single fan. Customers are baked sitting there, but the poor cooks are fried inside sweating profusely."}
{"text":"Super gujarati thali.. The buttermilk, kadhi and puran poli are delicious.. Large variety with authentic indian food.."}
{"text":"We ordered catering from this restaurant for about 35 people for a meeting we organized at the University of Toronto Scarborough. The food was excellent and plentiful. We will definitely use them again! Very professional. Highly recommended."}
