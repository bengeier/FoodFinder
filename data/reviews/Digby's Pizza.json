{"text":"Definately the best Pizza in Fort Mill.  They do eat in and carry out.  Excellent pizza.  The building is small and help yourself to the beverage station.  They are more expensive than others in the area but it cost more to use the quality ingrediants they use."}
{"text":"Great local business that works hard to make everything fresh and homemade.  Great pizza...I love the crust.  I recommend the ranchero pizza with buffalo chicken.  I have also had the homemade meatball sub, pasta, knots, wings, salads, and calzones...all really good.  Also, save room for their yummy homemade cookies!"}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place. If you are out and about for the afternoon or need a quick dinner option, they make a great pie and yummy desserts.  Good sauce. Fresh tasting. I'd call it NY style. And as good or better than many in town.  The owners are super sweet. The first time we dropped in, the wife could tell my children were salivating over one of her chocolate cream pies after we'd already paid and she packed a piece up and handed it to me for them. She wouldn't let me pay. What a sweet woman!  I've had a nice experience every time we've been. Family atmosphere. Games and brain teasers on the tables for the kids. My kids love it. We grab a few slices after soccer games over at the Ann springs Rec complex. I've also grabbed a pie and sub on the way home from work for dinner. You can order by phone or online. Very reasonable prices. Plus I like supporting their shop. They are good people."}
{"text":"I stopped by there on my way home from a long meeting yesterday and they made my night. Food was awesome"}
{"text":"I am a true fan of homemade pizza. This place has it. Now that fort mill has lost a couple of it's home town joints, this place Is here to fill in the gap. No more chain restraunt pizza. Good knots, good pizza by the slice. Big NY style slices. Hit the pizza spot."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Fort Mill and they are super fast! Try their Ranchero Pizza...super delicious!"}
{"text":"Our family ordered a large 16\" 8 slice pizza with sausage, onion, black olives and banana peppers on half total price $19.50. The pizza was good but not good enough to make me forget I just spent $19.50 on an above average pizza. I found the crust to be a under cooked and chewy. They were very light on the toppings. The sauce could really use some fresh basil it's a little bland. The flavor combination of the sausage and banana peppers is what gave this pizza almost all its flavor. There is definitely room for improvement hopefully they can tweak a few things including the price and really make their restaurant thrive."}
{"text":"I recently tried Digby's and found it to be a-ok.  The pizza I tried was cheese and it had a nice crust and good sauce.   On the day of our order, the amount of cheese they used was adequate.   The pizza was around $14 for a 16 inch.  Not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either. 

I am not normally a huge fan of wings, theirs were a tad bit on the salty side, but overall pretty tasty.  The wings (choose BBQ or Buffalo sauce) come with 6 wings, dip, and celery for around $6. 

We ordered take-out so I am not sure how good the service is.  It would have been nice if we could have gotten delivery for lunch on the day we ordered, but they only offer delivery after 5 pm."}
{"text":"I have never been dissatisfied with Digby's.  Every time I am back in town I come here and I think the food is good.  All of these comments about it being terrible food must have went to a different place.  I have never had a terrible dish from them.  When it comes to the price I feel that you get a good amount of food for the price that you pay.  The pizzas are big and any other dish that you order is way larger then what you get from pizza hut or any other pizza place in the area and still have a good quality.  I would also like to try one of Jeff L's pizza since he apparently has the best pizza in his unnamed town.

This is a good local pizza place!"}
{"text":"I love Digby's.  There food is really good and not overly expensive. I usually get the pizza roll. I also like the pizza and mozzarella sticks. Service is excellent and staff is very attentive to customer.  The only downside is there are only a few tables for seating. They do carry out so table seating doesn't matter for me."}
{"text":"Just ate here, and my wife wants to give it 5* based upon her Pizza Roll. I would give it 4 based on my Calzone, but unfortunately, there is not a 4.5. What is great about this place, is that they actually listened to my wife when she told them what she wanted in her Pizza Roll. As unusual as that sounds, trust me, nearly everywhere wants to add a garlic butter, or sprinkle some sort of green stuff, add a pickle to the side or something that is nearly impossible to decipher ahead of time. So when a place actually listens, and does what they are told ... woo hoo great. The staff was really friendly, and the food is made fresh. Personally, I wish the red sauce was a bit tangier, and that the meat calzone had a bit more meat in it, but it was a good product. So, here you go, basically a 4.5, but I rounded down because it is not really perfect. But as close as you can get in Fort Mill I imagine ... at least the best around here I have tried ... by a LONG shot. All the other reviews are from several years ago, and if I had not been told of this place by a friend, I would not have tried it. Trust me, the place is really good, and I just ate here."}
{"text":"Small local place with good food and nice staff. I come here sometimes for lunch with my girlfriend. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We're so addicted to this place...particularly their homemade potato chips!  I think I could live off those things!  Two bucks and you get a tray filled to the rim with the best chips you've ever put in your gullet!  The kid's chicken tender plate is as big as or bigger than most adult plates!  This is the only place that has cheese pizza I can actually enjoy, though still a little blot-worthy.  And their pizza roll is just like you see on commercials; a cheesy, meat-filled pastry that has mozzarella that stretches a foot when pulled apart or bitten into!  We've never had a bad experience with service here, and to be honest this place has ruined me for ANY chain pizza restaurant out there because of all the options!  Digby's has become a once-a-week treat for us.  Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Order - 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $4.95

Pizza was awesome.  I'm a Hawthorne's Pizza loyalist, but there's no Hawthorne's close enough for me to drive to from my Fort Mill, SC office on Red Ventures Drive.  This pizza is a super close second to Hawthorne's if not a tie.

Only challenge for me is that my office is on Red Ventures Drive and this place is a tad far.  However, I can order online ahead which is really cool."}
{"text":"UPDATE: DIFFERENT OWNERS, not the same . The prior view below no longer applies. 

Finally found a great place for pizza!!!! Surprisingly. We loved it. Now, don't get me wrong, pizza isn't exactly like I'm used to in New York, but it was really close. We orders the cheese pizza. Sauce was good, crust was delicious! Chicken wings were good, meaty and juicy, I got the BBQ with blue cheese. I thought they made a mistake and gave me ranch and they were willing  to come back with it!! Who does that?? The person who answered phone and took our order was really nice and accommodating. They deliver to my area!! Where has this place been? Can't wait to try other stuff!!"}
{"text":"I owned a successful pizzeria for 5 years a decade ago before moving to the area. We were voted best pizza and best calzone for all 5 years in a major city. I know pizza. My wife, kids and I went to Digbys hoping to have a local place but were completely disappointed. This is a carry out place if best people. We ordered our meal on a Tuesday- it took 40 minutes to get 2 slices of pizza and 2 calzones and a carry out calzone. They finally brought it all to the table including our carryout to get cold for my other son at home. They could have made it upon us leaving or kept it on top of the oven. When we cut into our calzones, each of us had about 10 oz of Ricotta come out of it. We couldn't even find the toppings inside. They also don't use mozzarella in their calzones? It was so bland, we basically picked through it. The pizza sauce was ok but sweet-lots of sugar in their recipe/ the pizza was extremely thin and very little cheese on our kids slice. After they brought our food, we had to ask for drink refills- no service. Not once did anyone ask how our food or service was. We have talked to our neighbors and all have concurred the same issues in their liquid calzones and lack of any service. (Oh, and you have to pay in advance when you go to this 6 table carry out restaurant-never understood that-how do you tip before you get your food, and why would you run your credit card again if you ever wanted dessert-what a hassle, and NO one cared) Giving them 2 stars is my Good Samaritan for the day!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Absolutely the best calzone I've had in years! The fried mushrooms were exceptional as well as the mozzarella sticks were monster size and absolutely fabulous. Delivery was speedy and very welcomed as we waited till the last minute to think about what we were going to eat tonight. Very happy and will definitely be back!! BTW my 83-year-old mother thought the driver was really sweet and cute!!"}
