{"text":"I've probably eaten at this location over 100 times. They know what I eat when I walk in( pho Tai Nam) 
I just did not do a review on it,  since I was lazy. 
The portions are always filling,  the price is reasonable,  and it is very clean,  the water is clean. Pretty much everything looks nice and clean,  which is why I enjoy this place. 
The taste of the pho is unique to this place as it does not taste like burnt water."}
{"text":"Probably the most watered down flavorless pho I've had in a while. The portion was big and filling like most pho places are. My friend ordered vermicelli with pork and egg rolls which was again bland and nothing special, but better than the pho. Only plus was the service as the lady was very nice and explained the menu and add ons well."}
{"text":"Love this place. The inside is very open and clean. Very well kept up and the service is amazing. They have all the variety of every pho restaurant! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I get spoiled eating homemade pho and pho from Vietnam. The service was good but the pho was not up to expectations. At first the bowl of pho looked appealing and then the noodles were too hard. They need to cook the noodles longer. So the pho tastes so generic like any other Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona. I will most likely not be returning to this location but I had to give it a try because it was the grand opening."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Spotlessly clean restaurant, lovely service and so so so delicious. My pho soup was excellent and tasted so authentic. I loved the Thai tea, I will get a smoothie next time! Great reasonable prices. I will come back soon! Also met employee Helen! Super nice!"}
{"text":"I hate sweating when eating my food so I don't understand why we are mid summer and they barely have the AC running with fans blowing. This reminds me the feeling I get when eating in Vietnam, not my favorite feeling.

The food for the most part was okay. The spring roll was very plain and lack luster, nothing you can't do at home. It was missing the crunchy fried egg roll skin that most restaurant put in to give it the oomph factor. 

Their bun thit nuong selection wasn't much. For the price  you would think they put more meat in there but no, just a lot of bun (vermicelli) noodles to fill you up. 

The most disgusting com suon I have eaten at a restaurant this far. They give you this huge portion of rice and then the rest is just ehh. The cha in the rice plate had the taste of nasty pork. Gross, very off putting. Nothing in that dish was working for me.

And then the hiu tieu sate..... my favorite dish out of all the dishes. If I had eaten this dish alone I would have given them 10 stars if I could. This was extremely delicious and I was surprised I liked it because it is something different that I have never tried before. It was a spicy soup base with pineapple and cucumbers in there with peanuts and minced pork. I loved every bite!!! 

Right before we left, on the floor there was a little cockroach friend to say goodbye... I don't do well with bugs."}
{"text":"Friday 5:30 nice and quiet a couple of dining guests. First time here and the King Rolls were $5.99 (4) vegetarian, SO GOOD! Chicken Fried Rice is amazing, love how it tastes you can tell it's a little different than most."}
{"text":"Came here for the first and last time today. I ordered the pho tai and there was too much oil in my broth. They used the excuse of making broth out of actual bones but.. they could.. have strained it.."}
{"text":"This place located next to Lee Lees Market is not as good compare to others in terms of food. The problem here is the food is not commensurate to what you spend for. Food amount is like food tasting event, it's too little. It's not enough to fill you up nor satisfy ones hungry feeling. I am not coming to this place."}
{"text":"Pho dam was one of the best restaurants I have been to in a very long time. Upon walking in I honestly did not expect to be pleased but I was greeted right away with a smile. She let us stand and look at the the menu to see if we would like the food they serve before she sat us down. She was very patient and the food came out super fast! I got the pho dam special and my boyfriend got the Mongolian beef. We only paid $20 for both dishes and the portions were huge! I did not even finish all my pho. I will definitely be back in the near future. Absolute best customer service, a clean restaurant and good food? You have me sold!!! :)"}
{"text":"First time in with kids, the pho was flavorful and fulfilling. Broth superb. Traditional beef all tender. Kids split tasty rice noodle dish. Staff was attentive and friendly, price point easy on the wallet. It wasn't busy on a weekday at 5/5:30 but the atmosphere was calming. Overall a highly positive experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef noodle with round steak pho and it was Pho-nomenal ! I've been trying every pho place in the valley and this one has made my top 3 list. Very authentic taste in the broth. My new favorite place. Can't go wrong here if you love Good authentic pho."}
{"text":"Pretty Good Pho.... Had the Pho with chicken, egg rolls and spring rolls, everything was fresh and tasted great. Service was really good super nice people.  I would go back. Would love to try their coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices ! And very friendly staff! The strawberry smoothie is to die for! :) I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best phó place so far. Being a vegetarian I see 5 options on the menu. But I always go with same option V4.

Ordered -
V4 phó with rice noodles and tofu : awesome as always. Broth tastes yummuier as always. One portion is more for a meal but who cares if food is so tasty, just fit it in your stomach.

Good ambience, no music and good for groups. Waitresses were kind enough to check on status frequently. Totally loved it."}
{"text":"No frills pho restaurant, just the way I like it. Service was good and the staff was very friendly. The place is a comfy size yet there is plenty of room and space between tables, if that makes any sense.They were running a special on oxtail pho, which I had never tried before. Some pho places I've been to have been a bit stingy with the portions of meat, but not this place. There were gigantic chunks of meat in a very large bowl of broth and noodles. Great flavor along with nice portions is a winning combination for me."}
{"text":"Came here in search for a durian frozen beverage, but found out that Pho Dam stopped offering durian shakes about three months ago.  PD now offers three flavors, all made from fresh fruit: mango, soursop, and strawberry.  I chose mango and soursop.  Since these are made fresh-to-order, there was a bit of a wait.  For those with allergies, you may want to inquire about how to avoid cross-contamination, since I am not sure if Pho Dam has more than one food processor/machine to make these shakes.  (I'm allergic to strawberries, and the thought about cross-contamination occurred to me as she was making these shakes, and I decided to hope for the best.)

Mom and I found the soursop to be too sweet.  If I didn't have the mango to make comparisons with, then I would say the soursop is OK, if a bit too simple/monotonal, but between the two, I'd just order the mango!  It definitely tasted fresh, and made of real, delicious mangoes, and not just ice, sugar, and mango flavoring.

I didn't ask, but I'm assuming these were served in 12 oz. plastic glasses, based on the size.  Each were just under $5, tax included.  

I'd return for more mango shakes.  Pho Dam, please bring back durian, and how about offering more varieties, such as cantaloupe and raspberry?  Perhaps on a rotating, seasonal schedule?  

Oh, how I wish I weren't allergic to strawberry and avocado..."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Vietnamese restaurant. I asked for no onions or green onions in either my plate or my daughters play because we were going to share. The lady wrote it down and shook her head and agree that she understood. 15 minutes later, both meals come out heavily loaded with onions and green onions. I let the waitress know and she apologized and took both plates to the back. About two minutes later she returned with one of the plates. It was obvious they had hand picked out about 3/4 of the onions. When someone says no onions, there are certain reasons for that. The heavy flavor of the onions makes me sick. The icing on the cake was when my 2nd replacement meal (orange chicken) came out with rock hard pieces of chicken. They were so hard, you could not stick before through them and when some of them finally did crack open, they were hollow inside because all of the chicken had been fried to nonexistence. When I asked the waitress for the manager, she went and let the manager know. I don't know what language it was, but it was clear that the manager cursed the waitress out very bad and was yelling at her. Then the manager came out and used a really sweet voice and told me, when the chicken sits on my plate for 20 minutes, it gets like that. At that point, I just paid my check & left. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone because the food is aweful and they treat the staff very bad."}
{"text":"The empty chairs around you may have you worried but I've been here a couple times and I honestly have not had any complaints so far!

I've been ordering the Hu Tieu lately. There is a lot of noodles in each bowl unlike some Viet places so I always get to take some home for seconds! The soups are nice and flavorful too. 

My father this time ordered the Bun Mam and he really liked it. My parents say it's usually sometimes risky to order at places because Bun Mam has a really unique flavor. We're a Vietnamese family and he really enjoyed it today! Yay. 

My dad saw that they also sold Soursop smoothies here. He said he used to eat it all the time back in Vietnam. We ordered one to try it and it was actually really good as well. Sweet, thick, and slightly tart but nonetheless very yum! I don't have a basis of what it is SUPPOSED to taste like but I honestly thought it was good. It tasted just as sweet as any boba or smoothie- those are usually sweet anyway. 

All their dishes average $8.99. Most of their menu items are that price except the specialty dishes like shaking beef dishes and foods like that. 

Servers are nice and friendly. The server didn't check on us for water refills but I didn't mind because I didn't really finish my water. You could have easily called him because he kept look out from behind the counter. But either way, good food! It's accessible from inside Lee Lee's Supermarket as well so you could always come in after shopping. 

Not too sure about who owns the restaurant though. I know the reviews have said they've changed bosses quite a few times but the prices they've mentioned aren't all the same anymore."}
{"text":"The best pho I ever had in Arizona. I just moved to Az few months ago and I did try lots of Vietnamese restaurants here but so far pho Dam is the best place. I like Thai tea and mango smoothies. And the food was so good. The most popular here is Special Pho. My favorite one is vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"The restaurant was extremely clean.  The price of the bowl was $8.99 where the average is about $7 in Phoenix.   Rau MA is $3.50 so for that price, taste of food, and value is not sufficient,  you will not Gardner community support."}
{"text":"This place is straight up cheap, family lies to cover the lies, horrible service, yells at the customer for what they did wrong. Who does that!!! 

Asked me yo give them another chance but it's even wrose than the rotten vegetables.

Wish the last owner take it back & make it right again."}
{"text":"I usually order rice dishes here and I would say that my money is well spent! Rice dishes here are very good, especially the lemongrass beef - one of my favorite here!"}
{"text":"My pho experience was limited prior to attending Pho Dam so I'm not sure if I'm the best pho connoisseur but I'm Chinese so I've had my fair share of soup noodles, lol!. Overall, I'm a fan of this place. When you go as frequently as I do, the staff begins to recognize you, knows what table is yours, and remembers your order. I'm going to take this as a good thing, lol! I've only ever gotten the #9 but I already know that I like it better than anything else on the menu *insert sarcasm*. The broth is flavorful and the noodles are a good texture. The soup is always just the right temperature. A couple of months ago, they raised the prices which made me a little sad but it's still where I end up going despite the fact that there are two other pho places in the plaza. Old habits die hard."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. They were playing the UFC fights on Fox so that was a bonus. The bowls were reasonably priced. Flavor was okay. Good enough to get you pho fix but nothing to get excited about. We also ordered egg rolls. They were okay. But again, nothing to get excited about. We were a little surprised that they didn't serve mint with the egg rolls and they provided only one leaf of lettuce. So we had to ration our lettuce to be able to have enough to wrap our rolls in. Would I go back? I guess. But definitely not the best that I've had."}
{"text":"This place is close to home so it's always been a good stop over if you're looking for something quick. This is a third new owner in a few years here,  and they're attached to Lee lee's Chinese market. The quality has gone down hill with each new owner and the beef is now really fatty and not very good. They also add cilantro to their Pho which makes it taste really weird. The lady working here seems nice enough and there were a few other tables with people eating. I don't know if I'll come back here though. That's too bad."}
