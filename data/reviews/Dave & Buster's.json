{"text":"The games are cool. But if you want customer service this is NOT the place.. They really need to understand of they continue \"I could careless attitude\" there going to lose there loyal customers.."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and all of our food was either cold or not what we ordered. Waited over a hour for our food as well. Our service was awful as well. Bathrooms were so disgusting and un-kept. I don't think I have one good thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"Not much for corporate places but come to the bar and the female bartender Dana is working she always has her a game . I'm I bar manager/ bartender and she's one off the best."}
{"text":"Great place to brings the young ones... It's loud and full of energy so you don't have to worry about your kids being noisy... Good food, drinks, and games! Something for the whole family!"}
{"text":"SHAME ON YOU DAVE AND BUSTERS, LAME EXPERIENCE FOR A GRAND OPENING! I'm only giving it 1 star because you have to put a rating to review!!!  This place is smaller compared to the other D&Bs around the valley. The waiter Alex did a half a** job and when my friend and I walked up to the bar to get our drinks right, we were turned away because we had two empty cups with us to show them we had been waiting for over 30 minutes! She was completely rude to us and rolled her eyes while we tried to explain why we had the empty cups in the 1st place and she walked away to attend to MEN instead of us ladies! Not classy at all.  Don't waste your time or money here, it's worth the drive to go to the Tatum location! They have bowling in there and the staff is super friendly and accommodating. Can't wait until this place gets replaced with something worth visiting!"}
{"text":"The food was over priced for the quality and taste. I ordered the hottie burger which was decent and cold when arrived at the table. We also had a fondue for the table which consisted of brownies and other sweets that seemed like they've been sitting out for a while. Couldn't get the server to refill my water either :( I also ordered a coronarita which tasted very watered down. Definitely will not return. On the plus side the gaming seemed like it could be fun (the gaming is the reasoning behind this review being 2 stars and not 1.)"}
{"text":"The games are fun, as expected. They don't have an extremely wide selection though, so expect to be disappointed with their offering at times. As for their food, if this place was a restaurant, I would probably give it one star."}
{"text":"It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. First of all, all of our food was cold. You could tell it had been sitting for a while. Second our waiter David was pretty bad. He flirted with every girl at our table, told us we weren't his only table so we needed to relax, rarely came by and asked if we needed anything, forgot to put in one of our party member's meal, and brought out plates one at a time. While I was eating my food my other party members still had not gotten theirs. When my girlfriend's grandma talked to the manager, Adam, and asked if they could do something for us since the food was cold and the fact it took forever he replied \"I don't like being demanded what to do.\" So we just decided to leave. Very expensive food that was cold and took forever to come out. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service"}
{"text":"Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.  Unfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.  My mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.    I like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead."}
{"text":"I used to love watching the UFC fights here but now they only play them in the back in a crowded room on a small screen. Haven't been since then. It's weird because Dave and Buster's is a major sponsor of MMA."}
{"text":"I was SO excited when I heard that Las Vegas would be getting a Dave and Busters! Being a Texas native, it was a place that we've hung out and celebrated at on many occasions. To my disappointment, this location is terrible. 1. They've hired the youngest, cheapest and most inexperienced staff and CLEARLY did not invest in their training.  2. The food is at best, mediocre.  3. Don't even THINK about hosting an event here because NO ONE will call you back or return your phone calls.  4. The venue is nice; but, tiny.  The only good thing about this place is Happy Hour Mon-Fri.  They have got to step their game up and train their managers and associates. It's not looking too good for this location.  I'm so disappointed. UPDATE: I have to give credit where credit is due. I finally got ahold of the original person that I spoke to about hosting an event, Ashlynne. She is AWESOME! She held on the phone with me while she made a contract and made sure that I received the contracted just in case I had any questions or concerns. D&B almost lost my business. Ashlynne saved it and I appreciate her help. I hope that she at least gets recognized for this."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food, the games, the atmosphere, it's all wonderful. And the price isn't too bad. I especially love their $16.99 dinner and games deal and their half price game Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This wasn't the cleanest place. Dirty paper towels all over the women's bathroom. No changing covers on the changing tables to change your Babies. Very disappointed when I came here compared to the other two I've been too. Also they aren't following corporate policy. Which ok, but when I asked about it to one of the managers on the way out, he said he didn't honor the first responders discount like the other stores do. Which ok Is fine, but he had a very sore attitude towards them. Very disappointed in his attitude more then anything."}
{"text":"We were at this Dave and Buster's on Saturday night.  The good part is that the food and drinks were good.  The not-so-good part?  We got there about 6:00 with a party of 4.  We put in an order for 4 drinks, an appetizer, and 4 meals.  At 6:25, we had received our drinks and the appetizer, but then we got told that we could only sit at the table for 2 hours!  We hadn't even been served our food yet!!! Then to top it off,  they had a DJ that night, and the mic was entirely too loud!  The DJ talked non-stop and it was so loud, it was annoying.  It felt like he was right in your ear!!  The games area was good.  The best part about the games area was that you couldn't hear the DJ out there.   We left at 8:25 after spending about $150 on food, drinks, and games for 4 people, an annoying DJ, and some ridiculous policy that said we had to eat our food and get out within 2 hours!   When I went in, I had initially considered getting a dessert.  But I didn't want to be rushed and I didn't want to have to sit there and listen to some clown in my ear talking non-stop about raffles!  So they lost that sale.  Will not be back.   There are too many other restaurants who would be glad to have our business without all of the nonsense."}
{"text":"I just feel like sitting in a long hot shower for like 12 hours after I leave this place. All the controllers and buttons on the games feel greasy and just bacteria filled. The food is  90s style TGI Friday type of nasty American fare that I bet lots of ppl like. I think it was very pricey.  I just can't get over the grime and the filth. The floor is just covered in trash in the gaming area and it's dark and dirty. My husband loves it though, so maybe It's me."}
{"text":"The thin waitress who served us over charged us, and didn't remove the unavailable dishes from our bill, and also lied to us about the prices of the games so we'd have to purchase more points to be able to play. VERY DISAPPOINTED as it was my first time and I'm a frequent arcade goer.  She also was too busy rubbing up on one of her Co workers to do work. It was absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"*** BUYER BEWARE ***  Drove here all the way from pickering for a date night,  only to soon become a nightmare.   When we got inside it looked like the building was under construction.  We waited at the host desk to be seated only to be ignored. After finally seating ourselves, the booth was dirty and we had to ask for it to be cleaned.  From start to finish we spent over an hour waiting for some semblance of a meal to arrive. After shoeing flies for an hour , our meals arrived. They were unappetizing and mine was even cold.   When the manager finally arrived,  we were treated with skepticism and given probably the most poor customer service I have ever experienced.   Will never return or recommend this place to anyone. How places like this stay in business is beyond me. They are a rip of and totally un Canadian."}
{"text":"Don't bother trying to call on a Saturday.  I've been at it for 2 hours and they refuse to answer.  Reservations apparently aren't accepted after all."}
{"text":"Awesome place to take the kids. Value for entertainment cannot be beat.  Food is above average.  Decent price and large portions."}
{"text":"This place actually deserves 3 1/2 stars.  I went to the one located on Tatum Blvd.  It use to be some other kind of restaurant/game place before.  My husband and I met up with a big group that was visiting from out of town and it was great for that.  They have some good deal where you buy a dinner for a certain amount (i want to say $15.99, but don't hold me on it) and you get a $10 game card.  Not bad, especially if you have a lot of people into playing the games.  We also ended up in the bowling section and had a blast.  Wait staff good and attentive.  Also, a big plus about them...you don't feel like you're being police patrolled...or that someone is going to walk up to you in 5 seconds shining a light in your face with a Breathalyzer just because your on your second drink in an hour and a half."}
{"text":"So I took my kids here last weekend and we had a blast!! Lots of games and prizes to pick from and the food was awsome, the only thing that bothered me was how expensive it was, I mean it wasn't crazy but it adds up, anyway overall great place for family fiun!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited for food for over an hour. Ordered an burger was brought out to me very dry no sauce. Would never come back here again."}
{"text":"The games are good but my problem is with the people. I watched some guy pick and whip his nose on the Mario cart machine. Then some poor kid put his hand on it. The service kind of blows but the bar tender was cool.  If it's one thing I would recommend it's to wash your hands good before you eat. This place has a ton of dirty people"}
{"text":"Hostesses were very unprofessional and rude. The wait for a table was ridiculous, even though they had over 20 tables available. The wait staff was slow and rarely came to the table. The games were great, but the prices and employees put a damper on the evening."}
{"text":"Great place to have drinks with friends or to take a date.  In my opinion its not really a good place for kids unless you are just taking them to play games.  The games are extremely expensive but the food is wonderful.  They give you enormous amounts of food, espescially if you order the fajitas.  Sign up on their website to get a free $10 coupon.  If you are looking to have a birthday party or a big event, they have gigantic banquet rooms for that.  Two people can easily spend a benjamin within a few hours with food, drinks and games.  Nice place to go once in a while, but my budget cant handle it every weekend.  Can be very busy on weekends with a long wait time."}
{"text":"I've been here and bowled with friends and had fun. We've sat in the dining room and had fun. Then gone to play some games and had some fun too. However the service is usually kinda slow. Food is good but given that's is an arcade you to do have to deal with kids and families..."}
{"text":"Awesome place for billiards, food, family & kids/video games and this one even had a bowling alley in it & was at the mall."}
{"text":"Went by this D&B for lunch and some games earlier today.    I'm not usually a fan of D&B food, but today I tried the Parmesan Chicken Alfredo ($11) and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  The portion was large, so felt like I got my money's worth.  The others ordered the Goldfingers Eat & Play Combo ($15.99 / chicken tenders & fries) and the Buffalo Bar Chicks (pretty much buffalo chicken tenders on dinner rolls).    This D&B's gaming area is smaller than the one I go to in Arcadia (CA) and there are fewer games too.  My sister assures me this D&B is pretty happening during weekends/evening hours, but right now I have a hard time believing this.  I'll go with friends next time and have a few drinks at the bar during evening hours.    It feels nice to not have to \"fight\" other patrons for the games.  I like to \"cheat\" and get loads of tickets by spinning that huge ticket wheel...always a line for that one.  I hit the jackpot and got 1,000 tickets...yay!!!    The prizes aren't worth much, but hey, we go here to have fun and pretend to be kids for a few hours.    I love that this D&B is located at the Tempe Marketplace.  I can take off to go shopping if I get bored, hehe."}
{"text":"Its fun, but much smaller than some of the others I've visited.  Its clean, staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie. They do have good  food. Gets a 3 stars because I get bored easily at this location."}
{"text":"The Arcade was cool and all, but the food was absolute shit. Would not recommend eating here at all.   Right off the bat, we noticed that the staff was unprofessional and poorly trained. We walked in and sat at our table for over 20 minutes until a server came by and asked us what we wanted. Mind you, she saw us multiple times walking in and out of the kitchen, and saw us without menus. She was also very unsure about things on the menu.   When I finally got my food (which was a half hour wait btw), it was so dry and flavourless that I couldn't even finish it. The chicken tasted off and the pasta was just plain awful. For an $18 meal I thought this would've been good but sadly I was mistaken. Asked them for a refund and walked out.   Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thanks for ruining my wedding! I have been in contact with this Dave and Busters months before they opened their doors so I could book my wedding reception on a specific date and time this upcoming winter. I have asked multiple times to place a deposit to hold the room and they failed to send me the information to place the deposit. I met with the coordinator in person to take a tour with hopes of finally being able to book the room but was told she would send me the contract via email by end of business day. I waited patiently for 4 days to finally get an email that says Hey sorry, we overbooked! Extremely unprofessional and I STILL have yet to receive a follow up email or call about how this going to be resolved. I reached out to corporate to discuss this situation and was directed to a voicemail box which again, no one has returned call. WORST experience of my life!"}
{"text":"I have the relative maturity of a 13 year old boy so anything with video games and wings typically ranks high on my list of favorite haunts.   Jillians offers tons of video games a good ticket-prize ratio and alcohol every 10 feet.  If I weren't married I imagine it'd be a good place for a date (remember ladies, 13 y/o).   The real reason I'm giving them 3 stars though is their imposter Fire and Ice Restaurant.  We went to a Fire and Ice in Tahoe and its improvisational dining (read: American Mongolian BBQ) rocked our world.   The folks at Jillians (read: Dave & Busters) call it the Market Grill but it's exactly like a Fire and Ice.  The only problem is that the service sucks and they're missing some key ingredients from the buffet.  Moreover, the salad bar makes the Sizzler look like the Ritz."}
{"text":"Steak tasted like chewy rubber, had to wait forever to get water, games are over priced. Really feel like there is no organization, I only go here when forced or because its on someone else's tab."}
{"text":"Went there today with 4 adults and 1 child. Decided to eat before gaming. Took about 15 min for a server to come to the table and get our drink order. When they did, said 'oh sorry, a server hasn't shown up for their shift.'  Understanding that they are short handed, said no problem. However iced tea had no ice, chocolate milkshake was like chocolate milk... melted much?? Food was ok, most of it was cold, only got checked on once about 20 min after food was delivered, and drinks were empty, or melted. Finally, had to hunt down anyone working there, which ended up being a manager to get the check. She (the server that the manager had to find) brought it over immediately, but then continued to wait another 15 min for her to run the card.  I'm sorry, but if a guest has to get up and find somebody to bring a check, why wouldn't you be on top of that table and pick it up right away. I am \"in the biz\" as they say, and I don't complain much. But this was ridiculous!! Kudos to the hostess though. Excellent job. Won't ever dine there again!"}
{"text":"We came out for my husbands birthday and I can't even describe how disappointing. We only had 2 beers since we waited 10 minutes for each, but there were 6 bartenders working. Metro stood 3 feet from our table which means they have some underlying issues, and it was tiny compared to other Dave and Busters. Very disappointed and we waited so long for a Dave and Busters!"}
{"text":"If you are under 21 you must be accompanied by a 25 year old. Not only is this a stupid rule, but the staff rudely expressed this and smirked at us because we were under 21. Awful place with rude people."}
{"text":"Did not have a good arrangement of arcade games and the food there was terrible. One of the worst Dave and busters ever!"}
{"text":"Food okay fit the bill for the kids they had a great time playing the games."}
{"text":"I actually love this place....all the games and drinks you can have here untill your heart is content !!! The games are fun for the young and old, I think I have more fun here running around playing games then any other arcade in the area. They even have a cool photo booth. They hold special paperview events here (UFC, boxing,etc ). Lots of TVs for sport enthusiasts! This place also has a rooftop bar thats a lot more quiter than the downstairs (unless there is live music out front ), but its not always open....I am thinking only on the weekends????!?!! You can rent out one of their rooms for any function you may have ( bridal shower, birthdays, team building, etc ). If you sign up online and register your card, you get $10.00 of free play money to spend on games all the time. When you use your card on drink and food purchases you accumulate points for free and discounted stuff ! They also have specials, but you have to go online to check them out !"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!! Our waiter Jackson was eager to guide us through the menu and suggest some great options for pairing our meals with the arcade. Drinks were delicious and the food was excellent.  My wife has a dairy allergy and Mike the manager on the floor spent about 20 minutes with us to make sure she was safe with her menu selections."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and this is my first review on this yelp app... I felt the need to make this yelp review. The servers suck they really do they aren't rude and they bumped into me 3 times and didn't apologize at all. When you sit down they should already know to ask what would you like to drink we got our food before the drinks. Bottom like I will never come here I would never work here if I had to use the restroom I would never even pee here."}
{"text":"The concept of Dave& Busters is on point. One of very few places for adults to drink & play & do something a little different from the norm. I believe this location has been recently renovated, looks great ! But.. SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!! Lots of staff but they all seem to move very slowly even on a Saturday night. We were sitting at the bar for about 10 min before one of the bartenders even acknowledged our side of the bar. Bartop was sticky and smelled horribly.. Like it was wiped down with a rag soaked in beer over night. Oh and the drink menu is so fun and unique. Usually the drinks are great, last night presentation was a complete mess. I wish I would have taken a picture.."}
{"text":"I ordered Philly steak burger. Before I ordered I told waiter that I order same last time and there were absolutely no steak. She said they are getting better since they opened couple weeks ago. Well burger came with only one pice of stake! She brought \"manager\" he said \"that's the way it is\" no sorry not asking to replace!  Last time I'm here ! I gave you 2 chance sorry I can't do the same mistake again! ZERO STAR!!!!"}
{"text":"Arcade for adults! If you have nothing to do, Dave and Busters is the place to go, they have games, a bar to grab a drink or maybe you want something to eat. This location is really great and always have great customer service.  The only downfall, you spend so much money to play their games and their prizes are very cheapy. They need to have better prizes for the money we spend."}
{"text":"took my god son here today... i have been several other times but today was probably the better days... he had so much fun and the food was great...."}
{"text":"Worst experience we have ever had at Dave and Busters. We were a party of 12 for my daughters birthday waited almost an hour for the table. Had to chase our waitress for service all night long. Food was dry and nasty and came out a total of 15 minutes apart, manager really could care less about our dissatisfaction and our bills totaled almost $400 for that? No way would we ever step foot in or recommend this place to anyone. Horrible experience. By the way we went on Saturday April 18th."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely disgusting. Went here with my boyfriend over the weekend and I ordered the boss chicken club. The chicken was hard and crunchy. I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. We also ordered an appetizer that we never got and our waiter could had cared less that we were even there. Definitely will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I came this Dave and Busters for my first time, and it was great!! The Philly cheese steak sandwich is unbelievably delicious that I seriously want to go get one everyday of the week!! The service was pretty good, although it took a while for someone to actually get to the table-it was like 3pm and no one was in there- but I know what its like to be a server and sometimes you get caught up in something else especially when its.slow!!   the only thing that caught me off guard was that a group of about 6 teenagers(maybe like 16-17) came in with one adult and they day down right behind us.. Two seconds later, the manager came up and told them that they had to leave because they A) weren't 18(which apparently is a rule there if your under 18 and don't have and adult with you) and then B) there was only 1 adult with the 5 kids and apparently you have to have a certain kid to parent ratio...??  other than that, the place was great!! And I will continue to go to D&B whenever I have enough money to go!! :)"}
{"text":"It's like a Chuck E Cheese for adults. Decent food, drinks and games (video games + billiards). They used to have decent prizes you could win with tickets (XBOX, TVs, PSP, jukebox, etc) but now they junk prizes like novelty hammers and Spongebob boxers. My favorite plate is the Lacy Chicken and my favorite dessert is their banana fosters pie."}
{"text":"The wait for our food was the absolute worst!!! When we were seated it took the waitress at least fifteen minutes before she came to ask what we wanted to drink. When we finally got our drinks, it was another twenty minutes before she came to get out order!!! Once the order was taken, it was an hour before we got our food. We had to find the waiter and ask where our food was. She then went to the kitchen and came back with our food which was cold!!! So apparently it had been ready and she failed to bring it to us in a timely manner. First and last time coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Finally I got to go to one.  I'm just visiting the mesa area from Utah  and had the chance to go. Utah gets the advertising, but not the bar... Which sucks.  I got to say, this place was pretty cool.  The food was very good. The games were awesome and great fun. It was expensive yes, but not as bad as you would think. Dinner for 2, expect about 50 bucks"}
{"text":"This dave and busters is highly inconvenient. They have a rule for minors in which they have to be with a guardian over 25 years of age. My younger sibling is only 15 & I being 19 am is only guardian. I don't recommend going to this Dave and Busters. That is a stupid rule for anyone who has a minor at a young age regardless of the family member."}
{"text":"not a place I will go again and spend my money on food. I had the nachos to share with kids and it was very poorly serve and my son had a burger wich the taste was not good so he didn't eat it everyone experience can be different so good luck anyways."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the early game when you are visiting from the east coast. Extremely kid friendly and food & drink deals."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, definitely feels welcoming. All the staff was very friendly, and helped with a first time guest I brought with me. I had a great experience with with the servers as well as the counter attendants. I was hesitant to come at first, but I enjoyed the visit to this location"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The service is average. The games are expensive. I don't like the fact you get \"chips\". If you take a close look and look at the true cost the cheapest game is approximately $.60. A game that charges 9.9 chips is almost $2 for one game. And please make your numbers even. It makes it easier on customer.   Truthfully after an hour we were bored."}
{"text":"Pretty much a ghost town on a Saturday afternoon and the dining wait was about 10 mins. While we were waited to be seated numerous other staff members walked by and didn't acknowledge us at all. Server was extremely rude, I'm assuming because we just stopped in to split an app sampler. Little does he know we tip over 30%. All in all pretty disappointed in the customer service"}
{"text":"Well so far i can see why this place has such crappy rwviews. The service is horrible here. Party of two waiting for over 20 minuyes while there ate like 6 booths open....finally sit down and no one...i mean NO ONE, comea to great us to say anything. I had to get the bus boy to find out who are server is...20 minutes later we are putting in out order with our drinks....and to point out again.....we are the only ones sitting on this side of the restaurant at this point.   I get this is a bisy place but its not the peak time right now in the restaurant area  9;33pm!   This place needs to li e up to its name and step up the service... Still waiting for my water........"}
{"text":"We have never been to Dave and Busters before but thought we would check it out.  It was confusing when you walk in as you have to go to the left to be seated to eat.  The bar to the right was empty.  Our server was very nice.  The food came out super hot.  My husband had a burger and said it was good.  I had the Philly cheesesteak which was good.  The green peppers were chopped into little pieces.  I would rather have strips like in Philly but it was ok.  We had to ask our server about the games and how to play.  We purchased our card to play and we played several games and supposedly won but all of a sudden we were out of credits.  It was a huge rip-off!  I'd rather go to Peter Piper to play games.  We won't be going back here."}
{"text":"We went to a mentalist show when we were here and he was amazing. The show was amazing the food was cold I wouldn't order in the show again. Wait staff was slacking"}
{"text":"Great place to go out with friends, family, or corporate parties. I haven't ordered their food there, though; seeing those prices just made me go \"nope! We'll get something out later.\" But the arcade selection is nice.  The rating I give is solely limited to my experience with the arcade, not the food (hence the 3 stars). It's a decent selection, but don't frequent there; they update very rarely. Come here like, once every two years, and you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"We had a very large group and they were not helpful at all.  Even though we had a reservation, they did not have enough seats and we had to split the group up.  I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak which was OK except that it was lacking cheese.  The fries were cold.  One of our party didn't get his order until everyone else was finished.  I've had better at D&B before.  This time the food and service were a disappointment.  Luckily, the people I was with made up for it."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service at the bar near the games. Jerry was kind and helpful."}
{"text":"The only bartender that knows remotely how to bartend is Missy. I asked 3 different bartenders for my tab over the course of 20 minutes all with no follow up. It was as if my credit card was being held hostage as multiple bartenders walked by without making eye contact or helping. Finally asked a manager for help when another patron who felt sorry for me flagged him down. His reply was we are really busy. I get it. Its Saturday night but when it takes 15 more minutes to cash me out while you're in the process of helping \"new to the bar patrons\" its unacceptable when paired with his snarkiness.  Won't be coming back as long as that manager is in charge."}
{"text":"trekked out to Vaughn because clients wanted somewhere with \"team building exercises\" aka they wanted a place to not have to speak to each other while still interacting. Dave and Buster's is full of games including skee ball, pinball, arcade games and other throwbacks. I enjoyed it. The food was a bit overpriced considering how far it is from downtown, but the service was prompt and the food didn't take long to arrive. My clients had a great time, I wish they had a location downtown to save on limo prices. Would return if I ever have to pick up clients from Pearson."}
{"text":"It seems the best days are behind D&B.  The games are now 70% games of chance that dispense tickets like you would see at a Chucke E Cheese.  The other 30% are primarily racing type games and all of the games we played were clean and in good working order.  I was put off by all of the ticket dispensing games and wanted to see way more arcade games.  They only had 3 machines that were 80s classic.  It's very loud in here but that's typical of any places like this.  As for the food... not so good.  I ordered a half rack of ribs and a good portion of it was very fatty.  The garlic mashed potatoes were good but the onion strings or whatever they were tasted very bland.  The service was good tho and our server was attentive to drink refills and checked on us very often."}
{"text":"I went last Saturday to celebrate my birthday with 3 couples and their kids. We got there at 8 and had to wait 2 hours for a table. After spending $80 dollars on games on my child we got called in around 10pm. We were all hungry and the children were exhausted. The service was bad and slow ...I will say the waiter tried his best ( it wasn't his fault) . While on the table waiting for our drinks a supervisor approached our table to in a few words that it was getting late and kids weren't allowed for much longer specially to go to the back and use the only washrooms in that monster of a place. We let that one slide ...we all just wanted to eat and leave. Food and drinks took a while, and some dishes came cold. One of the adults in our table had to give his dish back. We had already decided never to come back while on the table, but it escalated when my wife and child were coming back from the washroom when a saw a manager walk behind them giving them a dirty look, like if they had just gone on the toilet right there on the main floor. That didn't go well with me..!! After explaining to this manager how long we waited for a table,  and how bad everything was, he could care less and basically said kids weren't allowed at this time anymore. We all spend with games and food up to $700 - $800 . We left around 12:15 am  I will never go again and I'll make sure I'll tell everyone I know to do the same.  They should get rid of the restaurant area and just keep the game area. Become another Chucky  Cheese."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good time but noticed the lack of fighting games. Pressure to be politically correct I guess. In general, games seemed old. Food was decent, salads and burgers were good. Service at the bar was slow.  Place was clean."}
{"text":"I usually come in on Wed nights when it is half off game night. Let's be real, $14.00 an hour is a little steep. But I was in the area and wanted to shoot, so here I am.   NOT A FOOD IDEA!!!  For the host to tell me and I quote \"$14.00 a hour, you must be crazy\", didn't exactly sit well with me. But, I stayed anyway.   I got some balls, and headed to the empty billiards area. In the area, there were two servers who were soon joined by the host. Nobody checked on me for 15 min. Made no since to me. Its noon, I'm a fat dude, I may want a burger while I shoot. Who knows, I could have just wanted a soda or something. But, apparently, none of these things popped into their minds. By the time one of  them decided to come over, I did want a drink. I ordered, he immediately returned with the bill. Before this, I intended to run a tab. When he did this, I was done for the day. My drink was $9.51 .  I paid with a $20 he returned with a $10. Hmmm. I guess he decided to give himself a $.49 tip. Sad thing is, I am usually a great tipper. But, when you decide to tip yourself, so be it.   Needless to say, THIS HAS BEEN MY WORST D&B experience in some time. I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Adult playground my ass.  70% of the people in there after 9pm were small children, completely unattended.  Parental FAIL!  I could just sneak a flask into Chuck E Cheese for a fraction of the cost.  Never again."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant at 7pm, we didn't get our food until after 8:30. By the time we finally got our bill and paid it was 10pm. Leaving us only an hour to play. Probably won't come back. Took forever to bring out the food, most of the orders where wrong, and one of our guests didn't get their meal until we were finished. No one apologized, and we didn't complain. It was my husband 30th birthday party and it definitely put a damper on it. If I were to go back I would not eat there (food was good but cold), just play games!"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful.  We show up at 8:32pm March 9th, 2013. Buy a $25 game credit card, and within 15 minutes, the power goes out..........all night. Then after realizing our evening is shot, at least there's a restaurant we can buy beer at, right?!?!........WRONG!!! Attempts to talk to management went unanswered for HOURS.   Our server refused to let my pregnant cousin sit down, since they couldn't serve anyone since all the POS systems were down. Then after arguing for 20 minutes about letting my cousin sit down, our waitress was cut from her shift and sent home without anyone telling us. Awesome, 1 hour in and no drinks even.....  After 2.5 hours, we gave up and left. No food, no games, no service, no apology, no credit, no explanation, no nothing. We were treated like absolute garbage.  DO NOT GO TO DAVE AND BUSTERS!! This place is a cash-grab. Games are insanely expensive, food is overpriced, way too many people in the place (over capacity for sure), and in general just a bad experience. Save your money and go to playdium. At least they have power to their restaurant.   This place is a absolute dump........I'm not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great fun for the whole family.  Use the app for game deals. They will send you coupons via the app you can also recharge your power card via the app and the food is very good decently priced a lot of games to play for adults as well as children"}
{"text":"Holy $hit, I may still be waiting on my food when you read this review.    Come for the games. Hit anywhere else for food."}
{"text":"Great place to hang with your friends or bring the kiddos for a family outing! We went bowling and we had a blast. There was good music playing, several TVs playing on mute all different channels, and the food was actually ok too. But most importantly it did not smell like feet. Very clean and well kept. The service was excellent. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  I really want this place to be awesome, but it always ends up being just average.  Stay away from mixed-drinks at the bar.  They may look delicious on the menu, but they are over priced and poorly made.     Service is friendly, but slow.  Food is average and slow.  The game room is filled with kids on the weekend, but that is to be expected. Games are expensive."}
{"text":"First time ever to Dave and Busters. Came in at 2:30 pm on a Friday expecting it to be pretty empty and indeed it was. Went up to the counter and asked what do I need to do as I am new. He said just sit down and a server will come and explain everything. Went and sat down and waited for the server. Waited 10 mins and no one spoke to us and even the bartender saw is but she just ignored us. I also tried signing up for their rewards program online and the site does not work properly. So I just left after 10 mins and walked to the Yard House. Helped and served right away. Will not return to Dave and Busters ever again as the place indeed has terrible service."}
{"text":"Great place for kids wonderful staff. I've been to this place probably over 40 times the food was good the staff was great and the boys I nanny always have a fabulous time thanks for making it so kid friendly."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced for what you get, and served cold. Even warm it wasn't very good.   I was so ticked at spending over $90 for dinner for 4 people with terrible food that we just left afterward.  They will never get another dime of my money."}
{"text":"I took my team here for a company lunch (about 12 of us) a few weeks ago. The waitress forgot to put in an order for two of my staff members and it took until after everyone else was finished for their food to come out. She still tried to charge me for those two dishes...hmm I wonder why...let's say it together: \"gratuity is automatically included.\" It wasn't until I asked to speak to her manager that she agreed to take them off.  I also asked her to please take a picture of us at our table and one of the busboys decided to photobomb it on purpose...haha yeah funny, I am always game for a good laugh but at the end of the day it was very unprofessional as we were there for a company outing. I frequent Tempe Market Place and I'll be taking my business to Cadillac Ranch or San Felipe's from now on."}
{"text":"Average food good atmosphere to just hang out and play Billiards and video games etc  A bit load in the game area"}
{"text":"I would give the food two stars but because I did have fun playing video games I'll give it three stars.   It was 10pm on a Saturday night and Gary and I had both been working non stop since 11am, we were hungry and wanted to do something fun... I said video games??? and got his attention right away.   We took a stroll through the arcade to peruse our selection.  We found Ms. Pac-man, the only game Gary wanted to play.  So we had dinner first.   We split a Spinach Dip, 4 mini hamburgers and the fondue.  It was all just.... okay.  There were WAY more chips than dip, and the chips by themselves sucked.  The mini hamburgers were pretty good but only because they were on hawaiian rolls.  The fondue would have been better if we had more melted chocolate.  We ended up with left over marshmallows, brownie bites, graham crackers and bananas....    Oh, his martini was pretty good.  I had a couple of sips and really liked the glowing green sugar rim.  For what we ordered, it was pretty expensive and the portions were not divided accordingly.   THEN we went to play some games.  It took Gary three tries but he blew the high score that was on Ms. Pac-man out of the water!  So he was happy.  That was his goal.  We also shot some hoops, I even made 6 whole points! Yay!  We played a helicopter game and that sucked because I didn't get it... and we finished up on the motorcycles and raced each other about 5 times.  I do like video games but he always beats me...  We checked out the shop where you trade in your tickets but since we don't need anything we gave our tickets to three little kids to share.  If I was looking for something to do late one night, they close at 1am, I might go back to play video games... but I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for a long time so I took my gf and kids with to have a good time. The kids of course loved the games but commented they were expensive to play and the prizes were highly priced as well ( tickets I mean). They did have fun though and that's good  When it comes to the food they were average. Burgers were over priced and under delivered and I had the ribs. The sauce they out on the ribs was awesome but it wasn't a very filling rack of ribs. So that's why they were rated average"}
{"text":"with a family of 5 and 1 power card that has over $300 they won't allow us to add to empty cards from the card with $300.  That is pretty bad and it gets too expensive to frequent the establishment as often as we'd like."}
{"text":"I was here for a friend's birthday and it was just not a good experience. Our waitress was either high, hungover, or not usually a waitress. We asked if we could order an appetizer and she said yes and then walked away. Another friend ordered a beer, and we had to tell someone else she never received it when they brought our food. We also asked for another piece of silverware because we were short one, and that took at least 15 minutes to get. This place was not busy. There were maybe 3 or 4 other tables in our section.  The appetizer came out pretty quickly, but was lukewarm. The restaurant was out of many things including peach tea, mango puree/flavoring, and grenadine. I had a chicken sandwich that was probably 25% chicken and 75% bread. My friend got steak and lobster pasta that literally had one small piece of lobster in it. The waitress walked by our table a few times and looked at it, but I had to tell her I needed a refill even though my empty glass had been sitting there for a while. I had a diet coke and the first one was watery while the second one tasted like it had more carbonation than syrup. The waitress tried to be more personable as the evening went on, but it just felt awkward. I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here around 10pm on a Saturday night. The food was not spectacular, about the same quality that you'd get at an Applebee's or some place similar -- good but not great.  My steak was tough, but my wife enjoyed hers. Staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar), and had to wait awhile for a server. Food was prompt."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a family place but if you not 18 and over for get it I will not waste my money on a business that is supposed to be family oriented but wouldn't allow me to take my 17 year old sister in I'm 21 and a legal adult but can't take my sister to play games if your gonna make rules like that then don't let kids run around uncompanyed by an adult. Won't return"}
{"text":"How ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids. I drove 40 minutes to take my younger brother to Dave and Busters for a fun afternoon but we were denied. Their policy states anybody under the age of 21 must be accompanied by an adult over the age of 25. I'm 22 years old and I don't understand why I can't bring my 12 year old brother to play games. We've gone many times a year for the past 15 years. After todays experience, I will not be going back, whether I am with kids or not."}
{"text":"Being that I am a fan of food and video games what better than to combine them both in one building. A couple buddies and I were a little bored on a week night and pondered about what we can do. We were tired of sitting around the house playing video games and drinking so we decided to go to Dave and Busters. We first ate and had some drinks before we hit the games. I ordered the chicken tenders meal thing with the power play card thingy. It was decently priced but just mediocre in the taste department. I've had McDonald's chicken strips that were equally good but McDonalds doesn't have the gaming area that Dave and Busters has, or alcoholic beverages either. So after kickin a few back we decided it was time to play a few games. Of course, as a bunch of young guys, we turned everything into a competition. We shot some hoops, which i dominated, and played the football game too. I wasn't so good at the football game. Who knew throwing a football into a small circle would be so difficult, may have had something to do with the excessive drinking beforehand or so id like to think. They have a variety of fun games to play which is made more fun by the consumption of alcohol. I would definitely recommend this place for a slow but fun weekday night, but expect not to have gourmet cuisine made by Emeril Legasse."}
{"text":"First Friday open, Summerlin,  NV...what a crowd! Sara, our server rocks and the rest of the staff by observation are doing an amazing job!  Insane crowd! This is going to be so much fun!  Sherene Zegler"}
{"text":"After stopping playing a crane game to give a small girl who couldn't win one of my stuffed animals I left my power card in the machine and 2 seconds later it was gone.  I simply asked if anyone turned in a card which I doubted, Stephanie simply called a manager, ted was amazing, tracked my purchase and since I had the receipt and my debit card reissued another card within minutes.  Exceptional customer service and when I asked if he had a manager I could commend him he said he was glad I just got my card back.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Dave & Busters is a fun place to play video games and drink. It's sort of like a grown-up Chuck E. Cheese's. You play games and get tickets for prizes.  The games here are awesome. I still miss the boxing game but there are a lot of fun games to play. They add new games occasionally including smart-phone games that have been made into arcade games. The prizes are the typical junk that nobody needs but they do have a lot of recognizable characters to appeal to kids.  The food here is overpriced and is not anything special. The beer is normal priced and the selection is decent (which, for me means they have Guinness). My girlfriend really likes the cocktails they make here.  The location is really weird compared to other locations I have seen. It's not located in the city or at a mall or anything like that, it's hidden away in an industrial park on the fringes of Cuyahoga County in Westlake. Despite the name of the street, there is not much around it. For this reason nobody ever knows how to get here but it is accessible via I-90."}
{"text":"As soon as we came in, my friends were kicked out for being under age even though it said kid friendly when we searched on google. They asked for ID and when they couldn't provide their ID as they were 16-17, they were asked to leave and they were forced to waste their $20 dollar lyft ride to go back without having any enjoyment from the place."}
{"text":"Take a group and go late.  There are two key issues that present hurdles to having an all around good time at Dave and Busters. The first issue is the food is terribly overpriced and the quality was not impressive as I have found it to be greasy at times or overcooked. The second issue revolves around the bloody ankle biters, why you would want to drag your kids to a bar is far beyond me (I do however see why having kids can make you want to drink heavily) so the only obvious circumvention is to go later in the evening to avoid the annoyance. The variety of arcade games is not bad. They have several group play racing and trivia games but they are missing some staple crowd pleasing games like air hockey and strangely absent are the fighting style games (Tekken, Street Fighter, Mortal Combat, etc.).     In a nutshell go later in the evening with a group for the games and stick to a simple faire of bar food or you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Tempe Market Place is a great place to wonder around in this time of year (spring) with a variety of restaurants, shops, etc. Dave and Busters is worth spending an hour or two in but if you want decent food I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The restaurant here is horrible. The food is okay, nothing special but not awful. However, the service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. I went with a group of coworkers and the waiter repeatedly screwed up. He forgot our orders and had to come back and ask, brought somebody the wrong drink and somebody else got the wrong entree, and to top it off, he charged us for more food than we actually ordered. Luckily one of my coworkers caught the mistake. We talked to the manager and he gave us extra game cards which really didn't make up for the horrible service but at least it was something. I do not recommend this place for food"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! we waited for over an hour for our food. After the waitress walked by 6 times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food. And told us her help never showed up. We waited another 30 mins for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drinks we got. We left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food. No apologies nothing. While sitting there we noticed 2 other parties walked out as well. They didn't even get their drinks. I would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat. Drink play games fine. I will never order food there again."}
{"text":"Horrible management and staff.  Called for 2 weeks because our son had left his drivers license there by accident.  He didn't realize it until he was on a plane heading back home that next morning.  We are from out of state, therefore he could not just drop in to retrieve it.  We called and spoke to not 1 but 3 managers in a 2 week period.  They assured us that they had mailed it to our home.  Not so....it has been 3 weeks and still no drivers license.  Yes it is my sons  fault for leaving it, but the management should have told us that NO, they could not mail it, not that they would, and then NOT send it!! My son could have made an appt to get a replacement immediately, and not been waiting for 2 weeks expecting it to arrive in the mail.  We called numerous times, and each time they said \"Oh yeah....we mailed it\".  I personally think they just through it in the trash.  We were holding out hope that maybe it would arrive, but no such luck.  He had to wait 3 weeks for an appt. at our local DMV so it will still be another 2-3 weeks before he even gets his replacement.  Anyway, very disappointed with the staff and management there."}

{"text":"Dined here with my family 12/19/16. We were seated rather quickly, but it took 20+ minutes for a server to come take our drink orders (which was just water!), then we waited another 15 to order. Waited another 45 to get our food. I can't remember her name, but she was an African American woman who wore a leopard print santa hat. THE ONLY TIMES OUR SERVER CHECKED ON US WAS...... NEVER. We waited almost an hour for her to maybe even notice we were done and just ready to check out. I stared at her waiting for her to look our direction so I could get her attention. When I finally went to the front to ask for a manager to come to our table, she came back to hand us our check... no apologies for any inconvenience, not even a thank you for coming in.   Please don't waste your time and spend your hard earned money for terrible service. You're better off eating at a soup kitchen!"}

{"text":"Excellent place for good food and entertainment. This is the ultimate grown up version of 'chuck e cheese' because they serve booze. A great place to bring a date because it offers and interactive atmosphere as well as a fun place to go with your friends.  They have pool tables, arcades(that gives out tickets for prizes) 2 huge bars and a fun place to visit for ufc fight night."}
{"text":"It is our first time to come here. Nice place to watch sports, play games in the arcade area or just simply hang out at the lounge bar. The foods are great and the price are reasonable. It's clean and the staffs are nice and courteous. I don't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"We had a bit of fun and some of the members are helpful - but Shannon the waitress is very condicending. We had a couple drinks and an appetizer - quite demanding to order something - she didn't want to show me the bill and just took our money. Do not get her. The games are fun and worth it - but the service here and the food is overpriced. We got helped out at the end by a nice waiter (forget his name) and was professional like most servers should be. Would not come back."}
{"text":"We have come here a few times and have always had a great time.  Lately I have noticed the food to be mediocre.  It takes forever to get the food and it's been cold. I gave it a four star because we do have fun playing the games, but they need to get better, hotter food,"}
{"text":"Wednesday are the days to go.  Sign up for a rewards card.  They will email you 50% off gaming coupons.  Then on Wednesday, all games are 50% off.  Basically, playing all the games for 75% off.  They over charge to play, so 75% off is about the right price.  They won't let you use the coupon on Wednesday, just use the coupon on some other day, but go on Wednesdays to play."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here this week and it was just plain Meh (Thanks for the perfect word Yelp). It was a Monday afternoon so the place was totally dead which can either be a really cool thing (great, attentive service) or not so great (\"hello, hello\" echoing through the place) - it was the latter.   I got a chicken sandwich, pretty safe usually and it wasn't half bad.. it just wasn't half good either. They serve that crappy syrupy iced tea which I hate, and on top of that they disappear when you are out of your drink which is even more insulting when the place is empty.   I suppose this place does what it is supposed to at a basic level- they feed you and you don't die, but I will make it a point to head somewhere else. Or I'll just stop in for the overpriced games :)"}
{"text":"Dave & Buster is a huge scam. They change the price of their games based on peak loads and use cards to get kids to forget how much they are paying did the games and reload, reload, reload. When we went the games were about 75 cents each for 30 seconds game.   Next they claim you can open a rewards account for free and without what they call a power card. But when I tried to do this they insisted I needed to pay for a power card to open the rewards account.   Finally the food was good but the orders were all messed up and the initial delivery was 45 minutes and our server said they are supposed to deliver the food in 7 minutes. We got there before 5 PM so it wasn't a peak time. They had to credit money back for this.   And they don't print the prices of the drinks on their menu so you don't know you are paying double the normal cost for drinks until you get the bill.   Overall not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to play games, but not for dining. Both of my visits haven't been great. Both times I was having to wait at least 10 minutes for my server to come up to me and get my drink order. Both times the place wasn't busy because I went durning the week. Our server not only took a long time to get our drink order, but she took even longer to actually get our drinks! My husband ordered an alcoholic drink and it took her  almost 15 minutes just to get it from the bar, and there were only two other tables seated. Not a fan of the service, they need to work on their time and actually noticing a customer."}
{"text":"They have the worst service and their food is horrible. I hardly criticize but this needed to be documented. Absolutely horrible and the night manager was completely rude. All of the tables were filthy dirty and we sat for about an hour and half before we were greeted by a server and that was after we requested some service. Our waiter was a very nice gentleman and poor guy was thrown at our table. The manager such an unprofessional disrespectful guy."}
{"text":"We had a showroom in the back for a 20 year high school reunion. The manager in charge of our party was Jimmy. He and our two servers were awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday with my brother and his kids. I liked the TV screens all over since the NCAA tourney was on and so I was able to see every game on big screen. Was kinda disappointed in the lack of bowling lanes but it was what it was. Once I got the \"hook\" going I was unstoppable and we had a good time watching the kids bowl and get all excited. Would come back again."}
{"text":"This Dave & Buster is horrible when it comes to the eating part. We had to seat ourselves, find menus from other tables (which weren't even cleaned off), the waitress was so slow. The computers didn't even work so we could pay with card. The game part was okay. Just seemed pretty boring."}
{"text":"Not so great experience. Took my staff here after work for a few drinks and appetizers. Hostess would not sit us til our whole party arrived. The dining area was not even busy. We sat, and two more people from work decided to come so we asked her for two more chairs, she rolled her eyes, stormed across the room to get two chairs, dragged them across the dining room, and basically threw them at us. We just looked around at each other in disbelief. Our server was very sweet and polite, but the service was SLOW. We ordered alcoholic drinks, and he kept saying he was waiting on the bartender... but there were like 5 patrons at the bar. We got our drinks when our food came out. Ugh. A manager came over and quickly asked how the food was then walked away before I could tell him the food was fine but your hostess is a problem and bartenders are slow. I didn't feel like tracking him down to personally tell him. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"We started the tradition of eating her for a birthday celebration and after our last visit we will not be returning to this location.   The food is ok, usually I get the chicken tenders which are not that great. Since we only ate there 1-2 times a year I guess it's easy to forget. Their menu could use some additions as there aren't that many options for the $10 combo card.   Our last visit was horrible. We always go when it's not so crowded. And the night we went there this last time there was maybe 4 occupied tables. Our waitress, sherry was horrible. She rarely came back and very much did not earn a tip. She never came back to refill drinks until our meals were complete I think was the next time she came back to refill drinks. One asked for bread and butter which she went to get and NEVER returned with.   We had a baby with us who needed her diaper changed and while I hate to discuss bathroom issues sometimes when you have to go you have to go. Especially while pregnant. My sister and I got up to go to the bathroom and my brother in law got up to let us out of the crowded booth, and our never present waitress came up to our table in a rude tone and asked us where we were going...... Never in my life have I ever been asked by a waitress where I was going  when matters need taken care of.  While she did give us birthday sundaes they tasted like the ice cream was freezer burnt. It was a nice gesture though but I can still remember how watery the ice cream tasted. Nasty. It also took forever to get the check.    So then we went to the gameroom and had a great time in there but still the first part of the night left a bad taste in our mouths.   So 2 days later I was able to find the time to call. We all get busy and 2 days was a reasonable time to speak with a manager.   I called and was met by a rude manager. I think his name was Mark. Throughout the call he kept mentioning \"I wish you spoke with us that night\" he was rude throughout the call.  He kept wanting the waitresses name, I was able to describe her and like I said at that hour we were eating only 4 tables were being used. Not that hard to find out who it was. He looked through the receipts and I described everything everyone was eating STILL he claims he couldn't figure out who our waitress was. We needed to leave right away since we needed to pick something up.   So I called corporate. I can tell you if you have an issue with this place that is the best place to call.   The main manager at the Westlake location was supposed to call but that never happened.  We were given $40 in free credit which we will be using elsewhere. And we will never be back to that location."}
{"text":"Go there to play games and literally that's it. If you're hungry go anywhere else. The food was so bad John Taffer would find this place challenging. How they could even serve the food they did and actually charge for it makes me wonder how they are still operating. Chicken Caesar salad had ice cold chicken, no dressing and something so stale and gross I couldn't even tell you what it was but was hard enough to cut me open. Mini corn dogs were cooked in the fridge and lastly the wings were pink inside. If you're reading this do yourself a favor and never waste your money there."}
{"text":"Great place for large groups.  I am a fan of the \"dine and play\" specials that they do because it can get kind of pricey buying food, loading your game card and then getting a few drinks on top of that.    The food is okay but I wouldn't have expected it to be amazing anyways.  The drinks have always been good and the bartenders are really friendly.  The best part is that there's a game for everyone.  They have everything!    It's not a place that I would go every weekend because I'm afraid I might get bored with it if I did that.  So I just go once in awhile and they usually have a new game to play or a new entree/drink I want to try and that keeps it fun for me."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and ethics on the phone.  Got transferred to the national sales line and they told me I should of never been transferred to them.  The agent on the phone advised me to call the store back and talk with a manager.  I called back to see if they could make a reservation for me and they told me NO even tho my party was going to be for 20 people and it was my wife's 30th birthday.  I asked to talked to a manager and the host Michael refused to get a manager on the phone.  Michael advised me that all his managers were busy because they were expecting a party of 100 people and each manager needed to handle the party.  He refused to get in touch with a manager and in my mind was lowsy customer service.  Will not be attending this place for a party or special event.  At least the Desertridge location was able to advise me that it was open seating on the lower level. If I could rate them half a star I would, customer service is what brings loyal customers and keeps the bills paid."}
{"text":"This review is simply done on the games and arcade. I have not eaten at this D & B 's(yet).   Compared to the several other D & B's I've gone to around the US, this location falls short with the games. The variety just isn't there and there seems to be less games than other locations.   The one good thing, unlike other locations, you don't have to wait for most games too long  (if any)."}
{"text":"Drinks were great but we waited 45 minutes for our food , AND WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR .nick was cool but just gets overwhelmed with all the customers and doesn't know how to check up on the ones he's already talked to . Hopefully they can become more organized in the future."}
{"text":"Philly Cheese steak and Cajun Shrimp Pasta with $10 game play. Fellas, time to win your lady some prizes! Food first though.. Lol"}
{"text":"The food took too long to come out and it was cold. We sent it back and they took even longer to bring our food back. Our server had an attitude with us as well. The food was good, but I wish the service would of been better. Probably won't go back ever again"}
{"text":"Our friend's girlfriend wanted to surprise him by having a few of us meet them & their kids here for his bday this past Saturday. We decided to meet at the bowling alley & bowl for a couple hours.   It was pretty early, around 5:30pm, so we skipped ordering food & went straight for drinks. The kids (there were 6 total, ages 2-8) all got their sodas & chocolate milk, while the adults all got beer. Well except me, I tried their candy shop cocktail, it was yummy but I could barely taste any alcohol, so I went with double vodka cranberries instead. These lanes sucked! I am by no means a pro, but I was shittier than usual here. The things that come down after you roll your ball down the lane would do so before my ball even reached the pins, causing some pins that should have been knocked over to stay up. Pretty annoying! The cost is $25 per hour & $3 for shoes, you can fit up to 12 people in 1 lane so it's a fair deal.   After bowling we went up stairs to the arcade area to let the kiddies play some more. My hubby & I were the only ones there without any little ones so we were bored pretty quickly. We were getting hungry so I ordered him a philly cheese steak (came with fries) & myself the soft pretzel bites. Hubs said his sandwich was ok, fries were good & my pretzel bites were pretty good, the dipping sauces sucked though.   Overall, I'm sure this is a fun place to take your kids but for us it was just ok & way overpriced. I'd rather eat somewhere else in the future & come here for games (not bowling though) only, especially on Wednesdays when they have half priced games & during happy hour would help too."}
{"text":"Food is decent and the fun factor is better. When most of the good ticket games are more than 3 credits, which is about a dollar, having fun here can cost alot of dough."}
{"text":"Walked in, sat after being rudely told by front it's self seating. Browsed the menu, 10 minutes go bye server says \" you have to move we are closing this section\" I stated so we have too find another clean table, hope they don't make us sit for another 10-15 to be spoken too. She replied it's self seating and walked away. we walked to the door and I told the manager on the way out why. What she should have done was apologized and politely asked us to relocate and taken our drink order. Garbage cut rate service."}
{"text":"I've been here and it has been decent and good at times. My kids like the games and we use to visit every two weeks."}
{"text":"The overall experience was what I expected from prior visits to other locations. It's never bad, but it's not great either. It always seems as though they don't train their teams to exemplify great customer service. I never get the feeling that they appreciate the $100 I drop every time I go in to eat and play..."}
{"text":"I was celebrating my friend's birthday at Dave & Busters, and I got kicked out for no reason at all. I went to use the bathroom, and a minute later the manager comes by and asks me to leave. He claimed I threw a glass (which I didn't). I tried to explain that I didn't do anything and that I'm not even 21 so I couldn't have had a glass on me, and even though he had no eyewitness or video proof, they still kicked me out. I, my friend, and everyone at the party were beyond angry for me getting kicked out unjustifiably. I'm never going there again, and you would be wise to avoid this place as well."}
{"text":"The food was terrible the service was terrible the management was terrible would not recommend this place to anyone in the food came out wrong first time the food came out cold second time also I had to wait 40 minutes to get a table"}
{"text":"This D & B is a fun place to go with your family. In addition to all the games and activities, they maintain a great atmosphere for kids and adults alike. They also have a terrific showroom where they sometimes feature live entertainment. Definitely a good place to check out with the family."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, if you're looking for a night out in the town while having a blast with your friends; this is a great place to go.  Reasoning for 4 stars.  My girlfriend adores Dave and Buster's and will never turn down an evening here because of the atmosphere and games.  So there's a plus.  However, 30 or so dollars spent on \"power tickets\" will have you running back to the ticket venue for more fairly quickly.  Usually I end up with about 50 dollars worth on the first couple of times going.  (on just tickets, not including dinner)  Wednesdays (as far as I know) are always half price ticket days (meaning that the machines take half the amount of tickets).  So my honest suggestion, if you have a group of friends looking for a great time and a laugh, head down on a day that might save some cash."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Literally ever. I tried to give it a second chance after my first bad experience , but I should have stuck with my first instinct-- Do not eat here. We waited one hour for our appetizer, 40 minutes for our drinks. 4/6 entrees came out after 1 hour 20 minutes. The 5th entree came out after 1 hour 30 minutes. The sixth never came. We asked our server repeatedly where it was and it was always coming soon. We asked for a manager; a manager never came. I hope he or she finds our table at some point."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my daughters birthday and we had the best time! Our server t'sani(sorry I know I botched it) was wonderful. If anything we would come back for him! Good was great as well!!! Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Bar service was slow,very slow and not very busy. The worse part wad the manager, Tobi Frable. He was rude, condescending, defensive and unhelpful. Tobi quickly escalated a situation that would have been easily solved by a SINCERE apology. The issue with the bar service was never addressed, security was called because my brothers girlfriend was upset and she swore.  Security made himself sound helpful but didn't actually do anything and as we were leaving (we were not kicked out, we just had no interest in being there anymore) Tobi and the see critic guard were high diving and talking and laughing at the bar with each other. I use to love Dave & Busters, but after this visit i might never go again."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Not only is there tons of fun with the arcade games, but the food and service are superb.  I ordered a burger and fries, with a supercharged game card on the side. The price for all of that was less than what I have paid at other burger joints. The burger was perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients and fresh, hot fries. Honestly, it was a delicious meal, and so big I could not finish it. But, as good as the meal was, it was not the best part. The service, graciously provided by Eddy, was amazing! He thoroughly explained how everything works, like the combo which includes a meal and game playing card, the best games to play, etc. He was attentive without hovering, and he was super fun and happy. He made the experience just that much better with his sunny personality and exceptional customer service. Thank you, Eddy for a great experience!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times because my kids love playing all the games, which is fine but eating in the restaurant is a pretty bad experience. The service needs some work - the hostesses have no sense of urgency, the servers are slow to come greet you and get a drink order, slow to bring your food out and slow to bring your check (so you can get the heck outta there). I can't prove it, but me and my kids all were sick later that night, like barfing sick, and the common denominator - we all had burgers at D&B. It's been a year since we've been back. Don't want to take a chance."}
{"text":"Had dinner for my sisters birthday. No one got their  food at the same time. I'm not talking about with in minutes of each other, Some of us were done eating before the other plates came out. We left a 10 dollar tip and they charged my card 100.00 for the tip not 10.00. I didn't even want to leave the ten dollar tip the waiter was slow, our drinks didn't get filled even once. And it took her 20 minutes to return my debit card. No wonder she was adding the 100.00 tip."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed, place wasn't clean and games were not that great. Some of the shooting games didn't work properly. Drinks are expensive and super sugary. Seemed like a place for children's birthday parties, not adult fun. Star Wars game was pretty cool tho"}
{"text":"Was Packed. Service wasn't great. Price value on food was not good.  Should have gone on a different night for a better experience. Just my opinion. Didn't really play any games though."}
{"text":"As a first timer, we had an exceptional experience. Food came out quickly and hot and fresh. Thus far the best food we've had in Charlotte. Server (Mason) was very attentive and the manager came out to ensure we knew who he was and that our experience was positive."}
{"text":"Small, no where as big and nice as the locations in California. I was so excited for this place to be built. The food is good. I just don't like how it's setup."}
{"text":"Great new place to hang out with your friends or for a first date. Lots of games and great reasonable food."}
{"text":"Poor service is what earns this location a one-star rating from me. Sorry DnB's Concord, NC. I HAVE had positive experiences at other locations however, namely those in my home state of California. Your mileage of course may vary."}
{"text":"Abysmal service. We joined someone from out of town for a gathering. It took 15 minutes for a server to take our order. 45 minutes for food. No drink refills. No manager in sight."}
{"text":"Spend my 21st birthday here and we had a blast. The drinks and servers were all great. The manager even bought my first drink for me. Couldn't have asked for a better time. After we had appetizers and drinks we plays some games. Our favorite part was the interactive Jersey Shore photo booth. I would definitely recommend for a birthday celebration."}
{"text":"I love it, me and my girlfriend went there not too long ago, had a BLAST. Might be going again for valentines day. The food was good, and the games where fun. Plus the bowling alley and the pool hall added to more things we could do if we wanted to do. It's a big place full of fun and adventure, you just have to be down for anything!"}
{"text":"A great place to play games and eat grub. The wait staff was good and very nice."}
{"text":"A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy. $20.00 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hour.I recommend the bowling game ,ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several games that can be played in groups of 4"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We arrived at 9:15pm today and were told there was a 25 min wait to be seated to dine. There were 10 empty tables that were not filled.   45 minutes later the same tables were still not filled so we asked the hostess who was apologetic and finally seated us. We also didn't have a server so again the hostess had to get one for us. Now that our food order has been placed, it has been 30 minutes and counting and still no food.   Management needs to step it up. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with a trip to Dave and Busters for Fathers Day ,Been 3 years in the making and was worth the wait it won't take 3 more for my second trip"}
{"text":"The food was really good as well as the atmosphere. The employees were pretty bad though. Our waiter kept trying to sneak extra charges under us on out check. For example he added extra charge to out bill that was only six dollars, but he didn't even tell us about it. We had to look over the check to find it. When we brought it up to him he offered to take it off but it was the fact that it was put on there without our knowledge that bothered me. Additionally the bartenders were rude and unhelpful, and one of them was sweating profusely. I understand that work does that, but when you are making open drinks it is kind of gross. The manager was very nice however and gave us a few free plays to compensate. I would not really recommend coming here unless its just for the games."}
{"text":"I was sad to see of the bad reviews below because I love D&B. However, I was just there this weekend and has dinner then went to the midway. The food wasn't bad but our service was overwhelmed so we didn't really have a server, and there were a couple small errors with our order. The bathroom was a wreck, like always. The trash can is always full, floors filthy, and smells strongly of urine. Half of the games I played wouldn't read my card on the first try.  Bartenders were slow & didn't seem to care, except for the manager.   I'll be back for sure but this place needs some serious staff updating."}
{"text":"I mainly go here to play PIU but recently I got the chance to have dinner there for a cousin's birthday so I can finally give a full review!  I don't think I'll ever go there just for the food.  I got the steak there and it was really tough.  I never put steak sauce on my steak but I literally HAD to if I wanted to eat any of it.  I spent about 5 minutes chewing on one piece. :P We got this really tasty appetizer however that I would totally go back to eat again - it was a chicken nacho thing... wish I could remember the name!  As far as drinks I remember them being fairly priced and tasty. The Candy Shop drink is pretty good. :3  Now like I said my friends and I normally just go here to play Pump.  The one thing I don't like about the machine is that they keep it soooo low volume wise.  This really sucks because there are so many other noisy and loud games around it and, well, its a rhythm game.  You kinda really need to hear the music to play.  But despite the fact we spend about 2 or so hours just lurking around playing pump and getting waters and sodas so we don't pass out, save for one or two of them most of the staff are pretty cool. Some of them will gladly turn up the machine a bit if we ask.  From what I know of it pool and bowling is pretty expensive so we stay away from that normally.  But we totally hit up some pool on their half-price Wednesdays!!  Even if you don't go here that much I would suggest joining the mailing list to get coupons for the cards - that way you can get more bang for your buck when you can."}
{"text":"Worst Dave and Busters ever! The food was ok. The service was horrible. Our waitress accused one of my friends of underage drinking. She brought her manager over to our table and carded my friend who is 22. He then started asking questions and walk away with his ID. He Came back a few mins later and gave my friend his card back. For the rest of the night the manager continued to overlook our table and kept passing by scrutinizing every move we made."}
{"text":"We went last night.  We were seated, male waiter took our drink order.  Got my drink wrong and never came back to give my mother in law her coffee. A female waitress saw us waiting for a long time and asked if we ordered food. We told her no and that our mom didn't get her coffee. Female waitress looked disappointed in the first waiter and she went and got the coffee. The male waiter ended up serving a table next to us (not sure what we did for the male waiter to not serve  us). I would give 5 stars for the female waitress. 2 stars is for the rude male waiter."}
{"text":"The staff is rude and find any excuse to not sell chips. The bartenders have terrible attitudes and don't like to work. Many games were broken. And to top it off they closed early. Never coming back. Would never recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I came here with my best friend on friday and It was a good place. Took the waitress to acknowledge us for the first 15 minutes we were seated, but the food was good. I think this would be a good place for large groups, parties etc."}
{"text":"So sad, I enjoy this place in AZ & CA . It's the smallest D&B I've ever been in. Just really sad how small it is, with such poor customer service. No multiple bars just sucks the lines are awful. Poor planning D&B, Should have went bigger now you have that abomination of a D&B. Long lines for everything. Thank for the anticipation then the let down. Guess I'll have to go to the one's in other city's."}
{"text":"always  like this place   wish it closed late  every day"}
{"text":"Few pros, many cons. There is a variety of games to play in the arcade which is good if you have some friends or a date with you, unfortunately a lot of the games are out of order. I went on a Saturday night and it was packed so my friends and I had to wait for games to become free most of the time. The arcade room was pretty dirty and had garbage all over the place. Some games you can win tickets from but even if you manage to win enough the prizes are not really worth it.   Then there's the restaurant. Firstly, it takes a while to get a table so you should put your name on the waiting list before you head into the arcade to kill time. Next, when you do get a table do not expect anything close to adequate service. After sitting down the waitress took almost 30 mins to meet us and never brought us water. Appetizers took at least 30 minutes to reach us, entrees almost took an hour to reach us all the while different servers were bringing us different food and drinks we never ordered. All the staff was unapologetic and surly at best, including a manager in a red shirt who did not seem bothered at all with our concerns.   And the food, I have to say you should probably eat before you come here as the food quality is mediocre at best. I got fish and chips which I would never order again. I actually would not order any food from here to be honest. The batter didn't taste good and the fish was overcooked. The fries were stone cold and the sauce for the fish tasted pretty weird. The prices of the food were on the cheaper side but even then the taste and quality of the food is not worth it.   2 stars for the little bit of fun in the arcade and the TV's for sports. Terrible service, terrible food and terrible upkeep make this place suffer. Which is a shame because it had so much potential but a very, and I mean very long way to go before it becomes close to decent."}
{"text":"I recommend that everyone try Dave and busters for a fun date night or small group of friends. It can be fun. The staff are for the most part very good. They serve food and have a full bar, all average priced drinks.   My only advice is that if you do go, you should make it on a Wednesday night so that you get double points for your money. If you dont, you will end up exhausting your points in no time, and wonder where your money just disappeared to. Of course this is not somewhere you would go on a weekly basis, but even for a rare treat.... the price just isn't justified.   I'll be back one day.... just on a wednesday...... not any Wednesday soon though."}
{"text":"Tried to reserve a table at 6:45pm on a Saturday and told it was a 3 HOUR wait and even then they couldn't guarantee a table, but they also couldn't make a reservation ahead of time for less than 15 people. Half the machines are broken, the cards work about 50% of the time, the bartenders are overwhelmed, and the bathrooms are mostly out of order and filthy."}
{"text":"Had a great time!! Part of order was messed up and the manager personally came over and made sure we were happy. That does not often happen let alone on a big night UFC 193."}
{"text":"My friends and I went on a Wednesday night. We were there around 9:30 pm  Positives:  - half off games - happy hour 9 pm to close  - better games than game works in town square    Negatives:  -need more bartenders. Waited 30 mins just to order drinks. Waited another 15 mins to get them. The girl bartender made the wrong drink and gave us attitude saying it was our fault.  - when I wanted to give her  my card to pay her response was \"don't you see me holding 2 bottles\"  - um okay no rush I was just letting u know.  Hopefully this place gets better soon."}
{"text":"I like Dave & Busters. It's a fun place to just hang out. I ate their food the first time the other night, and the food was just okay. I would rather either just sit at the bar and get a soda, or play games.   also, kinda weird, but my soda cost more than my boyfriend alcoholic drink.."}
{"text":"I have to say this place would of received one or two stars if the service at the bar wasn't great. Two gals took care of my wife and I. I ordered the mac n cheese and it wasn't as good as I remember a couple years ago. The games seemed a bit pricey but that's ok. The real kicker is when I received my bill it left gratuity options giving a total of 15,18 and 20 percent before tax. That's fine except the percent was lower than my bill stated. For example my bill before tax was $67.5 and %20 of that is $13.5. Yet the receipt stated that %20 of that was $10.18. I am livid that servers and bartenders are being ripped off!! For shame on Dave n Busters!! I will let others know about this"}
{"text":"There is no other pace where adults wanna be kids again and kids wondering what is happening to all adults in that place, had a blast lol!!"}
{"text":"Good Service, fun atmosphere. would have five stars but the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Alex was our second server. She was fantastic. I would request her as a server again. However, as I said, she was our second server. Our first server finally greeted us after what I can only assume was a 15 minute battle over who had to take our table. He unenthusiastic-ally came to the table, never introduced himself. After giving him our drink order he disappeared. About ten minutes later Alex walked over drinks in hand and asked us if we were ready to order. Surprised, I asked if she was taking over, She responded that Alex had gone home. This is perfectly fine, but usually includes an introduction to a new server. Regardless, I would have expected him to have worked that last ten minutes of his shift, and bring our drinks. We had not received Kids menus for our 2 small children from server one. Alex was kind enough to list off options for our children and prompt accommodated us. She was an excellent server and saved us from a terrible experience with someone who clearly had better things to do than his job.    Food was great and we had an awesome time playing games. I wont knock stars for a servers bad day, but I hope he reads this and remembers that I go out to eat so I can have a good time. You get paid to make sure all your guests have a good time. Keep us in mind, even when you really want to go home."}
{"text":"With gas being outrageously expensive, you know a place has got to be good when you're willing to drive 60 miles round trip. Simply put, Dave & Buster's is awesome. I'm a grown adult, yet my eyes light up as soon as I see all the blinking lights in the Midway. Let's just say, I visit often enough that I can spot a new game as soon as I walk in. Games are reasonably priced (some take tokens - some deduct points). Join their e-mail club. They won't spam you, but you'll get coupons for free food or extra game play. Can't think of the last time I've been there where I haven't redeemed a coupon - free appetizer, free Red Bull Smoothie, free $10 game play ... and you'll get a sweet coupon on your birthday.  Dave & Buster's has a full restaurant (you can also eat in the Midway, although gets pretty loud and kids are typically running past your table). Food is good, although can't seem to get past their Huli Huli Salmon - comes with this d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s citrus rice, green beans and a huge portion of salmon with a sweet glaze. Almost always have leftovers, just b/c the portion is so big. Sometimes spring on an appetizer, too. Try their chips with salsa, guac and queso. Their chips come out warm and are light and crispy and the queso is plentiful! (see pics of food)  Play enough and you'll become a Gold Member. Perks - cheaper game play. So, when your friend is dishing out 3.5 points to battle you in Super Trivia (one of my favorites), you're only paying 2.5. Definitely check out Derby Owner's Club - a horse racing simulation game. It's a little pricey to start, but taking home that winning purse and knowing that you've raised a championship thoroughbred will make you want to adorn a silly hat and ask the bartender if he can whip up a mint julep! And, yes, they'll come and take drink orders while you're playing. Depending on what day/time you're there, they have different prices, too, so definitely take advantage of the off-peak times to really build up your horse.   Redeemed 38,000 tickets this past visit and am now the proud owner of a Nintendo DS Lite. Yes, you read that right - thirty eight thousand tickets. Their Winner's Circle has a pretty nice variety of prizes - chotchkes perfect for your desk at work to pretty cool stuff (DVD recorder, smaller kitchen appliances and a pink gas-powered scooter). Please spare me in doing the math to determine how much I really paid to \"win\" my DS. I'd like to hold onto the winning feeling for as long as possible!  D&B - why can't you come to the east side? Or, at least, meet me half way!"}
{"text":"We had our reunion banquet last weekend at this D&B. It was the highlight of our gathering. The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.  Kids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.  In the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience."}
{"text":"The past two years I've put together a fundraiser for a few valley non-profits. I essentially ask my friends for money to buy ASU baseball tickets for the staff and clients of the organizations. This year, Dave & Buster's reached out to me and asked how they could help. D & B was gracious enough to host us before the game. They were very accommodating, had great service, and provided an incredible experience for the clients of those non-profits. Words cannot describe how thankful I am for their generosity and service. Thank you so much! Not only is the facility full of fun, their staff is wonderful. These folks are committed to serving our community."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice with a lot of amenities. There are a lot of amenities for whatever you wish to do. We, my boyfriend and I, just came for food and hockey. They had many tv's surrounding us which was great for viewing! We ordered the Potato Skins and Bar Burgers & Wings Platter to start. The Potato Skins were a little plain. However, the burgers were awesome. (Pretty much one cheeseburger cut into quarters). We opted for the boneless buffalo wings and they were good but a little salty. The fries that came with it with it were kind of cold and soggy. We were still hungry after our appetizers so we ordered the New York Strip. It was good. However, the garlic mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box and mixed with water with cheese and chives sprinkled on top. Our waitress was friendly and checked on us many times but the waiters who brought us our food were lifeless - really unenthusiastic. \"Here's your food.\" *drops it on the table and walks away*  I'd definitely go back to watch another game and try other items from their menu."}
{"text":"I still love this place!  I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  It's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This place creates stimulus of epic proportion.  You walk in and you hear guns shots, lasers, the pressing of buttons - its bannans. Lights and sounds are bombarding your senses with an overload of information.   Drinks are great, food is on point, and the games are NEXT LEVEL.   I was going Jack Sparrow on some ghost ships - shooting at zombie pirates while sending the Kracken back to it's hole to go make me some f*in pancakes.     Great for the kids, for the family, or a date.     SALSA night on WED. is exceptional.  Happy hour drink specials popping off with free dance lessons from 7 to 8:30.  Swoop you up a female or a dude (for all you ladies) and dance your way into their soul."}
{"text":"They jack their game prices up on the weekends so come during the week if you want to save money! I've eaten at the bar a few times--just appetizers & drinks though. Spinach dip is pretty good-came with thin, warm tortilla chips (just how I like them) and also a small side of salsa. I think the salsa comes from a jar but that's ok because the main part was the spinach dip! As for drinks, I've tried the pina colada, lava flow, and snow cone. Snow cone is one of the crowd favorites there but I think I like lava flow better! I have never had a problem with service! Very professional staff."}
{"text":"Had a blast playing games with my Boyfriend and brother. The drinks were 1/2 off as well."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We paid our waiter with cash and were expecting change back. Never came back with change. Just kept a 35% tip. The bathrooms were disgusting. Half of the sinks didn't work. Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Waited for about 20 minutes without any of the servers or manager noticing. Manager was standing right next to us and too busy watching the game to care about service. I don't know how the food was because we left after the waiters around us served three groups of people who had gotten there after us."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this was my first time going to a Dave and Buster's. I have to say that I was very impressed by the food. The games were not anything special as they were they same as ones you would find in any arcade. They were a bit pricey too."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the website offering a New Year's Eve package and when we get there we were informed \"oh that event was canceled\" however it still appears in the website. Almost feels like a good old bait and switch tactic."}
{"text":"I went here tonight because I had no choice. A work group was having dinner here after a day long meeting. My NY Strip was very fatty and cold. Garlic mashed potatoes were too cold to eat. Thin cut fried onion rings were cold and greasy.  Salad came out with meal rather than prior to meal.  No one at my table was enthusiastic about their meal.    The appetizers prior to the meal really were pathetic. Looked like a 12 year old cooked frozen foods.  I left as soon as we ate as I really didn't care about the games.  I am sure if you had 12-25 year olds, could be a fun fatty food night with arcades."}
{"text":"Came here for a fun afternoon with a group of 10. We've been here for 1 1/2 hours and still no food... 20 minute wait turned into 45, soda was flat, no kids cups... Can't comment on the food!"}
{"text":"The food is, to be honest, bad. Burgers taste as if they've been in the freezer for months, and when ordered medium rare come well done and dry.  Steaks ordered rare and medium rare came medium well and well done, respectively.  Fettuccini Alfredo doesn't have any sauce to speak of.  Chicken fingers are dry and tasteless. Fries are about as tasteless as cardboard.  Honestly, you can't serve worse food if you tried.l"}
{"text":"This review is only for the food. Service was ok, but food was mostly from package. My side of mash potatoe was at room temperature, little cold for me.  Chicken pasta dish had 2 small thin pieces of crusted chicken.  Triple layer chocolate cake was horrible... it was dry in the center. I thought it was a stale cake at first, but the icing wasn't dry. So it was just a dry cake overall.  Server was nice, but the food was kind of slow.  I would not come back to eat ever again...  the price is average and there are plenty of nicer restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"The edamame was good but I've had better.  Wings good tasty and meaty.  Server was friendly and curious.  Great place for adults as well as kids.  Many didn't atmospheres in one location."}
{"text":"The service was great! Kitchen very slow! Took almost 1:45 to get food... The manager and waitress took amazing care of us!!! Have patience! Worth it!"}
{"text":"We just came from here - first time there. We were there for 15 min but were completely ignored. We stood by the front desk thinking maybe we needed to wait to be seated,  then looked around and saw it was a bar/arcade/adult chuckie-cheese kind of thing.  Ok fine - we will seat ourselves.  But during the time it took to figure that out (3min or so), there was a manager-looking type man right there at the front desk who never even looked at us.  And there was another employee explaining something to another customer so she was busy.  Alright semi forgivable-  so we sat at the bar thinking that would expedite things.  The bartender brought food to the people 5 seats away but didn't acknowledge us.  We waited, and could hear bottles clanking, ice digging and gabbing ( bartenders i guess?) but on one came.  Nevermind! We left.  It was not as if they were busy - it was quite dead.  Customer service is a no brainer- can't respect this kind of lameness- no excuse!"}
{"text":"Don't come for the food do not come for the food don't go to Dave and busters for the food"}
{"text":"We went in last night and there were 10 people in our party. The only seating that had servers was in the bar, which was fine. It was a mess in the bar though. We did find a table, but there was a huge booth across from us with food everywhere, table and floor that remained that way the entire hour and half we we were there. 2 other tables left while we were there and those tables remained un-bussed. Meanwhile, people kept coming in looking around for a table. They weren't busy at all and there was staff standing around socializing and on their phones. A manager even went in to the bar area and that didn't seem to do any good either. Still messy, dirty tables...Food was very mediocre at best. The young lady that was our service was very sweet and did a great job handling our large party. She seemed to be the only one working. The only reason I would ever come back here would be for a drink and play games. Don't know how long they can survive at this rate!"}
{"text":"Just finishing up a horrible dinner experience.  Server was slow and did not refill drinks. Server forgot an order of wings that was ordered for a meal and when they were delivered they were not cooked.  When I spoke with the manager he so graciously offered to take care of the wings - really ! You think I should pay for raw wings.  There were several other mess ups with our service - but not worth mentioning.  Mistakes happen ... But handling them with a bad attitude (manager) is a way to guarantee I will never return."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a 1 because I can't give it a 0! A decent percentage of the games were broken. We went to the attendant who couldn't have cared less, and instead of just giving us the credits back, they would send a game tech over to try and fix the game. I feel bad for the poor kid because he had to try and fix no less than 3 of our games. The drinks were overpriced and watered down. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"Never seen so many people look so busy and getting absolutely nothing done....seats everywhere....but waited 15 minutes to be seated....15 more minutes for them to decide who the waitress was for the booths behind the bar...15 more minutes for a sprite......45 minutes for a sprite...I left and went to steak and shake across the street....HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for bowling. We did come in close to 11PM but were told they've already cleaned the lanes and needed to leave quickly. Disappointed compared to other lanes but had a fire game so 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is ginormous.  Perhaps not as ginormous as other D&B's in the country, but it's more than enough for an evening.  If you go with the expectations of playing arcade games, eating arcade-esque food (AKA burgers, fries, generic salads) and knowing it's not a classy, super clean establishment, it's a fun, fun time.   My friends and I went through a period of touring the Carolinas, testing out as many claw vending machines as possible. (This is not a joke.) This brought us to D&B, and the night ended with over 40 stuffed animals.  The grip-strength on the claws is great.  With some skill and right toy selection, this place is a treasure trove.    Unlike some arcades and supermarkets, the claws aren't programmed to lose and lose strength after a win.  There's a nice selection of toy sizes...including a jumbo claw, which is filled with jumbo stuffed animals and D&B logo toys.   TIP: Don't play the mini claw with plastic jewelry inside.  You can win, but the toys inside are so chintzy, you'll feel cheated.   TIP:  Find D&B coupons to get the most credits loaded onto your card.    Yes, there are yipping kids everywhere-- and I did run into a couple broken machines.  Those were attended to right away though, so I can't complain.  The employees aren't exactly at Disney-Cast-Member friendly and attentive, but hey, you're here to race simulated race cars, play Skee-ball, and win tickets to trade in for cheap plasticky prizes.    PS: There is a lot of other stuff to do here, like the bowling and sports viewing areas, pool tables...but you know where I am...at the CLAW."}
{"text":"I may be a bit biased on this review (just being honest and saying in advance) cause' I haven't paid a dime to do anything at this establishment, even though I have been here 3 times now.   The reason: company party.  Open bar.  Lol.   The last time we were there was this year at our fiscal end-of-year party.  The company rented out the entire bowling alley!!   The staff was totally cool, chill and repeatedly checked on our status.  I am talking a waitress that kept coming every 5 minutes or so to check up on us and get whatever we wanted. It was very nice to have the bowling alley to our own company and not have to share it as we have done in the past on the second floor of the building.  Anyway, the only qualm I had was a manager came in after we had been there a while and started telling people they weren't going to serve them anymore alcohol (even though they were FAR from drunk and were not acting out in any manner at all).  I thought that  bit ridiculous.  How do these people determine a person is too drunk to drink?  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating because of that manager telling all kinds of people they wouldn't be served any more alcohol."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The service was horrible, our food came out soggy and it was the wrong order. Only 1 bartender was even nice and cordial. The other made our drinks worse than a kid would make it. Literally sat at the bar for 10 minutes before anyone came and asked us if we wanted help. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is for the bartender that was very nice (Mel I believe) and the games. This place lost another customer."}
{"text":"They need a better beer selection, but the key lime coconut margarita was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Was at the main bar after laughing our butts off at the improve. Got a beer right away. Then  all 4 of us became invisible.  3-4 bartenders saw my empty beer glass. And I tried to get their attention,for a half hour. Never got a 2nd beer. And it took another 15 to pay the bill. They weren't busy.  If I was by myself,I would of walked out with out paying.   No tip!"}
{"text":"So...I can't review because my family and I were turned away at the door on a Monday at about 5pm.  I'll explain. My daughter wanted nothing more than to try this place for her birthday.  It's pretty far from where we live so I took the day off from work and we planned on D&B for her birthday.  We drive down to Summerlin and she was so excited.  She is a game player.  We got turned away at the door because they rented the place out for a private party until 9pm.  REALLY??  No banquet area?  The whole place???  So they gave us a card worth like $20 or something for game play and we left.  A restaurant on our way home was happy to take our money minus the games. Will we return? I just don't know...I definitely would have to call first to see if the whole place is rented out again...."}
{"text":"I WISH THERE WAS A WAY I CAN LEAVE NO STARS. horrible horrible experience here. My boyfriend and I went to the bar after playing a couple of games to order drinks & the bartender was HORRIBLY RUDE. She was talking to everyone around us about how much she hated working there & how she just wanted to leave. Okay???? SO LEAVE! Anyway, she made my drink & it was AWFUL. So I politely asked if I can have a different drink (mind you I paid $10 for this drink of course I'm going to want to like it) she laughed & asked what else I wanted so I ordered something else. She then went to the people next to us (she knew them) & said \"I hate people\" obviously talking about me. I confronted her & also spoke to the manager who was apologetic but did nothing about it. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO COME HERE. Waste of time & money to be disrespected & have bad service."}
{"text":"It was very busy tonight, but I was still satisfied with the overall service in the restaurant portion. Our server was extremely patient with our group of 20+ and got our orders straight (for the most part) and made sure everything was sorted out, without being mean about it.   I ordered the teriyaki sirloin (rare) and a triple chocolate cake. Sirloin came out pretty good (the mashed potato on the side was very yummy with the teriyaki sauce) and it was cooked rare, which was what I ordered :) but it wasn't the greatest quality sirloin. Not a fan of the fried onion garnish - didn't really see the point of having that there . The chocolate cake was dry, so was not happy there.  My friends complained that the meat (esp. chicken and ribs) were very dry and almost inedible, so i  guess the dining experience depends on what you order.  I've heard great things about the cheeseburger and I would recommend the philly steak sandwich on the games special menu.   The games part of D and B is always fun :) It was bustling (people playing games and people watching hockey). which helped make the place a lot more fun (better atmosphere, if you will).  I played a lot of arcade games and it was great because people wouldn't hog machines. (the new-ish pacman game was a lot of fun!:) and so was the 8 people driving game my friends and i played.    Verdict: would go there for games (and probably eat from the games special menu that is available during weekdays and before five on weekends. I don't think I want to pay full price for the food ever again). The food dragged the rating down."}
{"text":"Spent quite a bit of money and won like 4,000 tickets. Bought a cool lamp and it stopped working the next day, total junk."}
{"text":"Hostess was an idiot. She complimented my shirt and then asked if it was a particular brand (Yeezy) I said no it's HM. She goes on to say with a annoyed face, HM is always copying. No, bone head first of all I know you're like 18 and think you know it all. But let me tell you my Metallica shirt is a BAND shirt. If you knew anything, the brand you think is so great is ripping off Metallica so why don't you try keeping your mouth shut.  She really has no clue how to do her job. The drinks taste good but that's about it.  They were weak. The place was way to loud. They could have turned it down. Food was just ok. Waiter was bad. Wow, he rushed us through dinner the whole time and they weren't even busy. He asked if I wanted a box, I said no and then he grabs my plate. Wtf?! I said, I'm not done! He was leaning on our table talking over my water cup. Gross. He tried taking our check before we even had a card in it. He was a mess. I've enjoyed other DB locations but this one"}
{"text":"I ordered the eat n play combo, my food was horrible. I ordered the BBQ chicken (good), with mixed vegetables (overcooked & bland), mashed potatoes (good). Had my boys with me,10 & 13. I tasted their dishes and it was better than mine; they had fried shrimp and chicken fingers respectively. That being said, the game part of it was a blast. We easily spent 3.5 hours in the game room. I suggest go ONLY for the games, as the food was sketchy on our visit."}
{"text":"I am totally willing to give a better review but this is based on last nights horrible fiasco. Trying to give them the benefit as it just opened but management needs to get it together! We had a party of 8. We were told we had to be on a wait list and needed at least 6 people to be sat. No problem we put our name down and 30 min later we were told that they thought it was a party of 6 and we should have been on a wait list...we did have our name down on said list. Then some high school kid was clearly flustered and said well my manager has me running around trying to find people and trying to figure out where to seat you...clearly angry with us. One member of my group went over and tried to figure out what was going on and one girl had a suggestion of us  sitting at a round top in a closed section and bringing a server over..smart idea as we wanted to eat and chat. The manager replies I would never put a party of 8 at a round top...uh ok...to many servers just standing around not attending to the dirty tables in the bar area and management is a joke! Rude and seemed to turn a lot of people off with her demeanor. hats of to the bar tenders who were the only ones who looked like they were interested in making some money and accommodating a few drink orders....seems odd for a place that just opened to want to keep people in the establishment...we went elsewhere and had a great server and manager was friendly...again I am willing to try again but wait a few months if you are going with a group of 6-8 they aren't prepared for that so give it some time and hopefully with fingers crossed it will calm down and smooth itself out and the shorter blonde manager will calm herself down and not be so condescending in front of customers..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.   Having been to the location in Milpitas CA and Jillians in Charlotte, NC. i had high hopes. Its nice to be able to act like an overgrown child without having to contend with kids running around everything. (Both of the other places didn't let underage kids in after 5pm.)  Yet I come here, and its like I was walking into a Chuck E Cheese with beer. Kids running around all over the place, playing on all the stuff I wanted to play. Finally get to play whatever, and some parent is standing over your shoulder because their kid wants in. I don't hate kids or anything, but damn. The food and drinks absolutely cannot make up for how much the place sucks.   Their game selection is also wanting, but I've said enough."}
{"text":"Where are the employees?  It absolutely makes me question the cleanliness every time I come here. All the children and people that come and touch the button handles and balls and may be sick or haven't washed their hands after going to the bathroom. These are things that should be addressed. You should have someone going around disinfecting the games and also checking on them to make sure they are functioning properly.  We walked in last night to sit at the bar. Drinks were cold and fairly priced and food hit the spot, but we waited well over a half hour for it. The games are always fun but almost every time you go there is a game or two or TEN that aren't working. This time it was the rock em sock em robot game that they currently promote on tv. Yeah, can't play that here.   I enjoy going here because its fun, but I will always come here with hand sanitizer. I actually saw a man use the restroom not wash his hands and was then playing a driving game five minutes later.  Not enough staff either if you're game is not working or need assistance."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed while walking upstairs was that the banister was sticky and filthy . next the fire alarm went off numerous times and the games shut off. management never announced what was happening and approximately how long the situation would last. You would have thought that they would take this opportunity to wipe down the machines and vacuum the carpet. You would be wrong.The service is poor. As I am writing this we have been sitting on the patio for over 45 minutes with no one coming out to ask if we would like something.  The tables outside haven't been cleaned either. The bar wasn't any better. Customers had to clean up from previous patrons. Not sure if they were just having a bad night or if this is the norm."}
{"text":"I am trying to book a bithday party for my son but I can not do this on line, I could't do that in person because the event planer is out , I can't book by phone because the same event planer is on vacantion and is not answering her phone and e mail.So I am very disapointed."}
{"text":"The drinks were pretty good but the food is very poor. No one in our group thought that the food was any better than a 2 out of 5.    I sent my burned fish and chips back and it was still so over cooked it nearly inedible.  Even the kids would not eat their food. Too bad the menu looks and sounds great, but they can't get close to anything.  Eat before you go."}
{"text":"I went to Dave & busters tonight with my coworker & 1 year old son. The staff there were not attentive when, mind you we stood in front of THREE associates who didn't even bother to acknowledge us while trying to get a table to eat. After waiting in front of these 3 for about 10 mins someone finally decided to say hello. We must've sat at the table for almost 15 mins before someone even decided to say hello and ask our order. The game area gets pretty busy which is usual and expected but the bathrooms were horrendous!! There were no changing stations in the ladies room (there were many babies there tonight) and it smelled completely horrible. I even opened a stall with god knows what all on the toilet seat. Just nasty!!"}
{"text":"Good fries...... Keep my water glass full. One glass throughout the whole meal. At least my husband got his soda filled three times. I received a second glass after I was done eating my meal. I understand getting busy but when I see the waitress walk by several times and bus empty tables and not attend to us that's when I have the problem."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here as a past time on random Friday or Saturday nights. The games are good and they even have a bowling alley. However, my primary purpose in coming here is to shoot pool.  The bar here is good. The prices for drinks are average/typical. However, I don't recommend dining here. The food isn't that great, as most of it tastes microwaved. And the food is way overpriced. Eat before coming.   The TV's are large, but outdated. So, if you're coming to watch a game, you may be disappointed by the resolution of the screens. But if that doesn't bother you, you should have an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!  It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me.   I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.  In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B.   I was just really turned off from that experience.   The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me.   It's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it."}
{"text":"Everyone complaining about the dining experience. You went to Dave and busters for dinner, for crying out loud what did you expect lol. I love the place, when I plan to go there it's because they have a giant arcade and I'm a giant man child. Know what your getting yourself into. Can't fix stupid"}
{"text":"I came here on fight night and the manager was very rude. I just asked how the seating worked and he laughed and said I'd die before I'd get a seat. Yes it's packed but I didn't know if it was first serve or not. There was also a football game going on after that ended we did get table and he was so rude and did even clean the table he just scoop all the crumbs and trash on the floor. Gross and unprofessional. BUT the server and the bus boy were so so sweet and actually cleaned the table and cared about good customer service. They are the only reason I'll be back."}
{"text":"The service here is HORRIBLE and RUDE!! Me and the bf went for football Sunday and it was pretty early so it was not packed yet. We sat at the bar and the bartender didn't even acknowledge us. She went on to help another couple that had sat down after us and after about 10 min she finally came over to us I asked for a drink and some menus and she never came back. Instead she was talking to another costumer of hers and served him his drink and gave him some menus. FINALLY another bartender showed up and helped us. I can understand if it's busy and the bar is full of people but it was early and there was maybe 5 other people at the bar."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  The menus makes things look good, but that's all. Had tater tots still cold in the middle as well as chicken wings that were raw in the middle. Beer was warm, and with only 6 people at the bar, still took 15 minutes to get a beer. Oh yea, did I already say it was warm.   Saw employees wandering around trying to look busy and there's no one in the place.   Such a shame for a place with so much potential.   Management should all be fired for excepting this kind of behaviour, but of course they are no where to be found.     Was thinking of doing my company Christmas party here. I advise against it!!  You will be disappointed"}
{"text":"food is over priced for the portion.  the real kicker was when I ordered a double shot of burbon on the rocks.  the bartender corrected me and said 'ok so rye'?  I said no Burbon.  He then proceeded to lecture me and state that rye was the same thing as burbon and that burbon was the american version of rye.  then he tried to serve me Rye.  Now I am by no means a whiskey connoisseur and if you only have rye I'm not a picky person.  But when you lecture me about the types of whiskey and proceed to serve me something other than the drink I requested I get offended.  yes burbon and rye are in the whiskey family however both have two distinct tastes and ingredients.  Why bother asking me what I wanted to drink if your going to correct me and choose for me?  kids these days have no pride in their work (not all kids). if they are going to be bartenders be good at it take some time to learn your trade and get your facts straight"}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday there. We ordered off the special occasion menu. Surprisingly the food was quite good. We had burgers, pizza, and chicken tenders. The price was reasonable and everyone enjoyed themselves. But I write this to give kudos to the employees. Brian, the asst. GM was so very courteous and helpful and hospitable. He definitely made it worth it and make us think about planning future events there. Great food. Great service. Good times."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars.  I'm here for a bday party.  It's terrible.  We decided to come to the bar for drinks.  My Guinness first pour has been sitting there for almost 10 minutes... Then she looked at it, looked at me.... And went and did something else.  This is after waiting 39 minutes for someone to acknowledge that my glass 2as empty.  Then she finally decides to come over to us and says oh.. I forgot...that's just the beginning.. Oh and my loaded tots that should be dripping with cheese... Seem to missing the cheese."}
{"text":"Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.  The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.  Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.  The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee.   Note the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior.   Also note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's).   The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.  This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.  Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.  I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there."}
{"text":"This place has many busted games, not well kept, dirty, and expensive.  I never thought i would say it, but save your money and hit up a peter piper pizza.  Kids will enjoy it more, and they serve cold beer there too!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place IS LOUD (sorry, was I shouting?)  Good deal on Wednesday: 1/2 off games.  Also, for $15 you get your choice of an entree AND a $10 game card.  (on a wednesday, this lasted a kid 1 hr of playtime).    Otherwise, I think it's not a fun experience for adults: food is not great, don't even get me started on their drinks (ew).  BTW, my pet peeve is they have no prices in their menu for wine, beer, pop, drinks??  What is with that?!  With the hot summer months looming before us, yes, I will be back to take kids for a couple more Wednesdays, but the moment their $10 card is empty (or 1 hr - whichever is 1st!), we'll be otta there :-)"}
{"text":"The service and food were horrible! Our waitress was telling us how someone had walked out on a huge tab that week. By the end of our meal, we understood why! It seriously took her over 30 minutes to get and retrieve our check. Food was beyond salty. I would never eat there again. Like, ever.   We haven't been there in a while, so most of the games were new to us. The games were fun."}
{"text":"Came here last month, service and food quality was great. Lots of fun games for all ages, we had a great time.  Decided to come again on 8-14-16, Dustin was our waiter, although he's a bartender.  Service was horrendous. Food was even worse. All of our 5 dishes came out separately, about 10-15 mins apart each dish so we were literally here for almost 2 hrs just eating.  My toddler got the kids pretzel dogs which were dripping in grease, i requested fruit instead of fries but Dustin said they don't have fruit. What type of restaurant doesn't serve fruit?! Don't you use fruit to make drinks also???? So Wtf? Then my husbands steak salad looked like hamburger meat, didnt even bother to take a bite to try it... So he asked for a salmon instead and the guy who bought us our food and the waiter talked about the the food being sent back for like 5 minutes... Like whats the big deal? So unprofessional.    No meals were comped... Could have at least gave us a few extra tokens.  Next time well just go to the YardHouse next door.  Get it together D&B!"}
{"text":"Horrible when it comes to children with needs.  My son is very particular with what and when he eats, so when I decided to bring the family to D&B to spend some $, we were disappointed to hear that they would not allow my son to come in with a small bag of nuggets and fries.  I was going to make up the difference by buying him dessert there, which we hardly ever do and spend some money on some games.  Needless to say they have lost our business and hope that anyone with children that understand where I'm coming from, do the same."}
{"text":"There is good food, but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens. It's great for adult fun after 10pm. Great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxed"}
{"text":"They don't take reservations for dinner. We were told that the wait was around 2.5 hours. The strange thing was there were empty tables and not reserved. We got there around 8:30pm. Since we were starving, we headed over to Boston Pizza! They literally sent us a text message at 11pm saying that the table is ready. Not smart, people will end up eating elsewhere!  The bar service was bad! I was standing at the bar waiting for service. The bartender was just chatting with his co-workers. He also told me to stand somewhere else and wait for someone to help you. Wait, so I guess he didn't want to help me. I left!!!Second time, I went to a different bar at the game side. I asked for the drink menu at the bar and the bartender ignored me!"}
{"text":"Terrible.. Since its been open we were coming her every week. Service is the worse of the worse, change pass for wi-fi every week, food taste bad-bad...too loud, bad smell, bathrooms are dirty and the girls working up front are not friendly....They constantly change their stuff.. Every week new people working here who apparently don't care because they will be fired anyway for being very unprofessional.  Highly recommend to hire professional and well trained stuff, better management!!!...., tasteful food, just like it looks on the pics and taste not like garbage, stinky odor needed to changed  for fresher cleaner one, dirty plates needed to be washed properly, etc... If you want to have the worse of the worse - come here..."}
{"text":"I'm a clean cut  well dreesed white guy. I approached the desk and told them the connect 4 game took our money. The 3 attendants which were all black just looked at me the one I was directly talking to just looked at me in a condescending way after she told me to go stand by the machine for who knows how long and wouldn't refund me what amounts to around a dollar. I spend about  $50 a mo in here. The game technician questioned me also like making me tell my story about what happened and seemed to be making some sort of judgment call over a dollar. This is a joke. No real money was at stake and the way you handle this is turn the machine on and leave. If you see the same person over and over sure make judgements but these are clowns on their first or second jobs and care more about power then company customer service"}
{"text":"If you like to wait then this is your place to go!   Waiting at the bar to get a drink- good luck. The Bar Tender keeps leaving to service the waiters.  Took 15 minutes for 5 of us to get drinks.  Then when we did get a table. It was 47 minutes before we got our food.  Which I think is probably microwave and boil in bag.  I guess the kids like this , but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our bartender Lexi was great! We will definitely be coming back because of you girl!"}
{"text":"Parking - there is plenty of parking on site.  Staff - The staff is very friendly and very helpful. They were able to provide me with everything that I needed.  Food - I ordered the barbecue cheeseburger and was disappointed. The pull pork that was on my hamburger was ok but a very small amount. The meat on the hamburger was very dry. I ordered a medium well and I think they gave me a well done burger. I really didn't like the pork and hamburger mix. To many different flavors. Also they are starting to give small portions of french fries."}
{"text":"This used to be \"Jillian's\", BTW, for those wondering...  Food: Overpriced bar food. Eat elsewhere first unless money is no object for you. I recommend \"Slices\", great pizza joint just across from D&B (more or less). Hell, lots of restaurants at Desert Ridge which are better choices. I would only eat here if I was starving after an hour or so of games.  Drinks: Overpriced. My suggestion: bring a bottle opener from home. Park between D&B and Total Wine. Walk to Total Wine and buy a bottle of good beer. Open it (outside!) with the aforementioned opener and drink it while walking back to D&B to get your buzz on. Maybe buy an extra one or two to stash in your car, so you can top off your liver. I absolutely refuse to pay for drinks here, since they are already ripping you off for the credits you have to spend on video games.  Service: I usually don't eat or drink here but I gotta say that the few times I've had to interface with wait staff/help... well, they don't exactly go out of their way to be helpful but they are not jerks either, and that does count for something.  Games: well first of all, the scam is that you buy credits that go onto a card with a magnetic strip, but it's kind of hard to do the math to figure out the credits-per-dollar exchange rate, and then figure out how much each game is costing you if you had just been able to pump quarters into it like the old days. I am just curious what they are charging me per game, and I think I have finally figured out it's rather high, of course depends on what game you are playing.  Suggestions for not getting shaken down too badly by D&B:  1) Go on 1/2 price Wednesdays. 2) Join their club, every month they will send you coupons. Some of them are \"Buy $10 get $10 free\", but other times they have actually sent me $10 free in gameplay. That's $10 free without having to buy any credits. However you can't use these on 1/2 price Wednesday, so just go on some other day if you can, charge up your card, then go back on 1/2 price Wednesday. 3) If you like old school games like Donkey Kong or Galaga, they got that and you can play them pretty inexpensively, especially on 1/2 price Wednesdays. 4) Attain Gold status; you save 10% in credits once you've charged up your card with a certain number of credits over time.  Prizes: they almost all SUCK and you will usually pay much more by trying to earn tickets to get the few things worth having in the store, than if you had just gone out and bought it with your cash at the department store. I got a decent coffeemaker only because I found a bagful of tickets someone had abandoned, and I got the remaining tickets I needed by shrewdly choosing to play Trivia when lots of people were playing. I totally rock at trivia and in one evening (1/2 price Wednesday of course!) I easily accumulated the tickets I needed with only $10 out of pocket (got an additional $10 credit free thanks to a coupon or something).  All in all, I don't mind coming here every so often but only when I can figure out a good way to game their system, because otherwise it is a VERY expensive way to play arcade games and drink/eat. They must hate people like me!!!  Downstairs they have a shit-ton of large screen TVs; it's a decent place to go just for strictly sports bar type of activities (like watching a Suns playoff game). Again, the food and drinks are overpriced but having so many big screen TVs all over the dang place kind of makes up for it. The upstairs arcade area seems kind of small compared to what I would expect and compared to what I hear the back-east D&B's look like. Also it seems the stairs keep the rugrats away, I see a lot of complaints about them but I rarely see them upstairs.   NOTE ON CREDITS: OK I think if you spend $12 you get 60 credits. That's 20 cents a credit. Most of the games 'cost' around 4 to 5.6 credits (they are almost always fractions, not whole numbers). So you're paying about a buck a game, which is on the high side I think, though again if you go on 1/2 price Wednesdays I think that is quite reasonable; if you attain Gold status you get another 10% off the credits charged against your D&B card.  So if you can score one of those 'buy $10 credit get $10 credit free' coupons, and IF you go on 1/2 price Wednesdays, it's quite a deal for gaming. But the food and drink prices are still way high (especially considering the food is completely average, you'll never tell anyone you ate really well here) and there is just no getting around that."}
{"text":"Wide variety of food and drink choices on the menu. Took a little while for our food to arrive and we were the only ones in the restaurant part of the place. Had really great spicy peanut chicken Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Came after work about 530pm, service is slow like molasses. Had to flag a manager down to get drinks, menus and even a hello. The food took long, per our waiter due to a large party of 20 it made the kitchen backed up. It was happy hour. They never brought my drink I ordered as well. Long story short...not coming back.."}
{"text":"It was the first time going to this D&B this past Friday, and it was not the best experience. There worst part was that I was showing my cousins around AZ, since it was their first time visiting.  As soon as we walked in the place it seemed a little warm. Uncomfortably warm. We were playing pool and the booths we were sitting at had all their bus tubs full of roll-ups and dishes. 15 minutes had pass and not one server came to ask for our drink order. We had to flag someone down, who was not so happy that we asked for service. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks,  which we got AFTER  we had just given up and went to the bar to get our own. We finished our drinks and decided to leave. Not a good time at all. Rather drive a little further to go to the one in Tempe."}
{"text":"This review is for the salsa  nights on the floor only. Being from LA, I usually have a pretty high expectations when it comes to salsa events. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the salsa night on the top floor. I visited in spring, so the weather was just right (I can imagine it may get too hot even at night during the summer).  There is no cover, and it comes with 2 hours of instruction which is awesome and rare.  There are all levels of dancers and all ages as well. I found most people to be friendly and willing to dance. They have a an informal dance contest which is fun and not intimidating. On the night that I came the place was packed. They play mostly salsa and bachata, with a sprinkling of merengue and cha cha cha. Towards the end of the night as it gets closer to closing time they start to play some hip hop and top 40.  If I am ever in the tempe area again I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is the third and last Dave and Busters for me.  I travel a lot (150 nites) a year.  This is my third In the past year.  Service at the bar SUCKS.  Wait forever to order a drink, beer is warm.  Food is mediocre.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is huge. The food was not the best, maybe because most of it was almost cold by the time we received it. Slow service too. However we had a good time playing at the arcade."}
{"text":"Visiting Dave and Buster's was a moderately pleasing dining experience followed by a mediocre entertainment experience. The food was reasonable, filling and comparable to a Denny's or Applebee's dining experience.  The games were reminiscent of a chuck e cheese, Peter piper pizza, etc. not many games for adults. I \"played\" a shooting game, paying for the required credits and was displeased to find that the gun did not work and the game abruptly ended as I was unable to defend myself against the enemy. I played several other games accumulating minimal amounts of \"tickets.\" At the end of my visit I was unable to redeem my tickets for anything appealing or desirable. I will probably not visit this establishment again. Thank you."}
{"text":"The information line is horrible. I can not get a live person regardless of what extension I use.  I have a party reserved and can't get additional info. This is so frustrating.  WILL THE GM PLEASE CONTACT ME .      After talking to Manager Darrell it appears their phone system was not changed over from night mode. He went out of the way to make our party happy.   5 stars"}
{"text":"Great idea, a little overpriced and mediocre service but for a place this big, it just kind of comes with the territory. Cool location, overlooks live shows sometimes. Price is average at about $6 a beer."}
{"text":"The service is horrible here, the staff do not care about food allergies at all. I told them I had a gluten sensitivity and had to substitute one of the sides for something else. The server put in the order wrong and ended up replacing the wrong side. So the side that would cause me a problem was brought out on the plate with my entree. When I told the server about it, I was told to just scrap it off my plate. I told her that I wanted the other side that came with the entree. So she put in an order for the side, but what was brought out was not what it was suppose to be and clearly had phlegm spat on it. And on top of that, they ended up charging me for that incorrect phlegm covered side order.   The bartender I had was not much better. I ordered a cocktail without whipped cream and he gave it to me whipped cream. When I pointed it out and told him that I'm allergic to whipped cream, all he did was scrap the whipped cream off the top. He commented that the amount that was left on top shouldn't kill me."}
{"text":"If they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating. 2.5 hour wait and then cold food served. Did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates. Bathrooms atrocious. Nothing positive to say other than don't go there."}
{"text":"Had my sons birthday party here. The planning for about 20 kids went smoothly with the event coordinator. They put together for us a very fair and great price and entertainment package with food and refreshments included. However when we got there the kids complained a lot of the machines they liked were broken and we couldn't get them to work. Also the food had kind of poor quality for what we figured we payed. Expensive pub food , sad for a franchise /chain which we usually don't do but you do what you can to make kids happy . Hopefully the only time I have to go there is on a different parents dime ."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, we came at lunch time on a Friday. Initially I thought it's very loud in here then I realized well it's more of an adult fun zone hence the loud music. I acclimated in about ten minutes I looked at then menus and I was pleasantly pleased with my choices.  I enjoyed the appetizer which was a nice size portion, it was there quite quickly. I actually had to push it away or I would not have been able to enjoy the rest when it came.  Then came the salad and the chicken noddle dish the steak was very tuff but the salad was tasty.  The chicken was definitely banging so much flavor and the Thai noodles were amazing you couldn't get enough of them.  My granddaughters pretzel dogs were beef dogs a they were really wrapped in very flavorful pretzel bread that were made perfect. I recommend these dishes and I will give the steak salad another try next time."}
{"text":"My team walks in to this location wanting to eat then play. We walk over to restaurant area, we tell the hostess how many in our party, she explains 45 minute wait, we look around in the restaurant, literally more the 8 empty table/booths. Then we walk over to bar area, every table had old food/plates etc. No one helped us, we finally went up to bar where 5 employees were standing, mentioned that we needed a table, 1 girl continued to gossip while passing immature dirty looks as if she knew us, finally 1 buser said I will clear a table and help you ladies. We had to patiently wait to be helped, took over an hour for us to place a drink then food order. No one checked on us and mean while tables were still disgusting, 2 customers complained about the same issue we were having, one customer threw a fit and walked out. Clearly they need more help and better etiquette. This was the worst experience my team has ever experinced."}
{"text":"Went to D&B wednesday 5/19/10 my GF and I where meeting another couple for dinner, drinks and some fun, luckily you can have all of those at D&B. our friends where running late so we started playing a few games, and we had to reload our cards.  this is where the only bad thing about my experiance at tempe D&B was, at the scottsdale location they give 10% off for military when you reload your card, which since i do the $50 everytime then do the supercharge, basically i get the supercharge for free, which i like a lot, according to the lady at the front desk the tempe one doesn't do that.  So we reloaded our cards played a few games, putting the annual spanking on my gf in nascar. our friends arrived and we sat down for dinner, and so did a large (20 or so) group well it was happy hour and you can't pass up 1/2 off drinks right?! we put in our order and it was just taking awhile, as it turned out our order was in after the large group, and we had to wait. well not long after the train of wait staff brought out their million dishes we recieved ours, both our waiter (Jason i believe) and the manager (i'm assuming) came and told us that dessert was on them, SWEET! (no pun intended). our food was good also only problem being that one of our chicken wings had a lot of fat on it. I had trhe southwest grilled chicken salad, I'd say that i should have handed over my man card but when a salad is that good (and considering the crap fried food i had for lunch) i held on to it.   now If we could just get rid of all the kids after 9pm..."}
{"text":"Fun games with good prices, great that they also have rewards card. The food is just okay a little pricey for what it is. The million margarita is awesome, my favorite go to drink!!"}
{"text":"I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was good. We were served quickly and the waitress and the waiter in training were friendly and polite. Grandkids had lots of fun with the games!"}
{"text":"Dave and Busters is the place to go if you want to play some games or even just hang out with some friends! There are a ton of games to play from and it's super easy to keep track of your tickets earned and credit with their new system. Their prizes are a bit lacking but you really just come for the fun.  I've had their food a few times but I wouldn't really recommend it. The service, especially in the game area, is very slow and the food quality is mediocre. If anything, I suggest eating somewhere else, possibly in the colossus plaza area a few minutes away, and then coming here for the rest of the night!"}
{"text":"Went with a group from work.   Hamburgers reminded me of high school cafeteria,  service was slow waitress shorted every person that paid cash.  Beers were warm and way over priced.   Way over crowded and not worth the cost for games.   Was rather disappointed to have to pay $2.00 for my game card."}
{"text":"Got seated in the dining area quickly because it was slow. Waited 20 minutes and the waiter never came. 3 other groups were seated close by and they ended up leaving as well. While we were waiting we witnessed 2 other tables complaining about how long it was taking to get their food. Would not recommend this place for dining and the gaming is OK for kids."}
{"text":"Service sucks, and the bartenders have shit attitudes. Food is good, and love the games and billiards. I guess bring ten of your drunk buddies,  they'll acknowledge you as paying customers then. Bottom line: Don't come here for good, friendly, welcoming service. maybe"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE coming here but the service was EXTREMELY slow. This was our server's first night and I understand. It just took too long for everything. The bartenders were slow. Everything was slow. It's a new restaurant so I guess it gets a pass."}
{"text":"Confessions of a 20 year old girl child; I love arcade games, and yummy food.   My boyfriend and I came here for his 22nd birthday, and spent $100 for both food and games.  We got and app and two entrees, drinks (he had three beers, two shots. I'm underage.), and $50 on a game card! Our waitress was attentive but not annoying and she knew good service.  Reasons for a 4-star and not 5-star: --TOO many kids. If I wanted to be surrounded by unsupervised children with overly intoxicated parents that are more interested in their awesome beer tube we would have went to Peter Piper. They shouldn't market themselves towards adults but let children run wild. I get being \"Family-Friendly\" is a good thing, but their marketing is misleading.  --The card station ladies were not helpful. It was our first time to D&B so we had no idea what to do and when I asked questions I got A LOOOOOT of attitude.   Overall, the cost was extremely reasonable! The food was good, my boyfriend was drunk and they have skeeball! Their prize room is dope! We will return, but will make sure we go in late on a school night to avoid sugar infused children."}
{"text":"Went today 6.16 to celebrate father's day early! AND we had so much fun. Our waiter was amazing, he joked around, suggested amazing drinks, and he was very attentive. This location is a little smaller but still very fun! Oh and it was HALF OFF WEDNESDAY!!!! Couldn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Games are fun,  food is disgusting.  Seriously over priced and has no flavor.  Don't waste your money especially in downtown summerlin where there are tons of restaurants that are far better!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the wait wasn't long. There were a few mistakes when it was time to pay, but nothing that wasn't fixed. I had the double turkey burger with fries and my niece had the kids macaroni and veggies. We both really enjoyed our meal and went to the game room after the meal and of course it was crowded! Overall it wasn't a bad experience and I've been here several times so I'll definitely make my way back again."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Chuck e cheese is better. The food here is so bad and not a lot of games. Chuck e cheese ripoff"}
{"text":"We got seated and weren't acknowledged. after 10m I complained...the waitress blamed it on lack of communication..."}
{"text":"I just left the establishment. Last Wednesday I spent 129.73. I did the survey on the bottom of the receipt that said write the code on the bottom. I did so. Tonight I came back in. It says on receipt I can use it for 10.00 game play with purchase of game play OR use it for a free appetizer. I was told \"not on Wednesday\" by the cashier I explained it doesn't say that.  She called asst Mgr Avery over.  Avery- you can't use it cause it's half price games. Me- where's it say that?!  Avery- it doesn't, we tell you when you get here Me- it doesn't say that, so your saying I couldn't get the free app if that's what I chose instead,  Avery- nope. Zero coupons on wednesdays.  Me- I came last Wednesday, was told to do survey, with no exclusions mentioned or even printed on receipt. I don't work here, how do I know? Avery- cause I'm telling you now Me- who's the district manager Avery I don't know Me- wow who's store manager  Avery- Phil Me- you are wrong , are you sure you wanna go with this Avery - yes, Avery was nothing but cocky and didn't care. How about do what it takes to make a customer happy? I understand the emails have exclusions. But this receipt survey DOES NOT. I want to speak to the Las Vegas area manager about this. On 2-9-17 , store manager Phil has made situation right"}
{"text":"The worst experience. I walked up around 5 pm and security at the door asked for our IDs and said \"Y'all look hella young\" (We were all clearly over 21 but great level of professionalism). I ironically didn't have it on me. He didn't let us in and then I watched two groups of kids walk in immediately after without him saying a thing to them. Good luck Dave & Busters- you lost my families business!"}
{"text":"20 minutes no service and 20 minutes for drinks. Warm beer to boot. Wow. Not a great experience. 1 hour no food."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 5 star review, but I can't. 10/28/17. We got there to be greeted by a host who clearly couldn't stand her job, but that's per most places.  We sit, and look over the menus and order our drinks, then food. My husband's drink was fine, but my piña colada, had no alcohol in it. My 2nd had very little. For food, my husband got a \"BBBacon Burger\" and I, the 8oz serloin medium rare*. Both came out totally flavorless, not even salt and pepper, and my steak was medium and my husband's bacon was 1/2 second from being undercooked. He didn't even finish the burger.  Well, we went to play games which was fine, no issues.  Then we decided to get a banana's foster to go, once we got home and started to dig in, we found quite the long hair burried in the whipped cream.   All in all, i'm pretty disappointed with this location. I know they're still new so i'm hoping they'll get better."}
{"text":"Great service. Don was attentive and took care of our refills promptly. My bourbon burger was very good, I added frazzled onions to make it amazing. They took our specific requests and our food came out right the first time."}
{"text":"I have no problem paying for admission on New Year's Eve but not advertising a 40$ admission fee on any part of their web page is misleading. First time here, last time here. In my opinion the CEO, Steven M. King should attend a business ethics class."}
{"text":"Great selection of games, alcoholic beverages and food. Unfortunately it does have its flaws and needs to be adapted to Las Vegas.   When I lived in the East Coast, this was our playground. When I heard about them coming to Vegas, specially near me, in the Summerlin area, I have to admit I was ecstatic!   Everything about Dave & Busters is great, since I can't eat out due to them not catering to my dietary restrictions, I won't be reviewing their food.   Unfortunately in their limited space, they chose to instead of amping up the actual games that people play, with Carnival games, such as the coin tossing games and etc... and limited the amount of competition based games people come here to play such as the Racing, Shooting and Fighting games.   Drinks are nothing out of the ordinary and a tad overpriced, but it's what you'd expect from a chain.   Bullet Points   * 4D Terror Machine has a HUUUUUGE line everytime, I once waited over 45 minutes in line and didn't get to play. They should honestly get 2 in there, get rid of the Luigi Mansion one and add another 4D Terror booth.   *There is an airplane shooting game that is incredible, it was tricky to find where to open the door that lets you inside of the booth, but it's one of the best immersive games there  *There is a horse racing area in the back. You breed your horse and train it and race it, in the end you can print out your unique Horse ID Card which you can keep with you so you can always come back and race with your saved horse.   *Skip the \"Rollercoaster Experience\" crap where you lay down on a seat that vibrates. It is extremely pathetic, the volume is low, the graphics are outdated and it's not a bit thrilling.... it is a vibrating chair with a video of a weird rollercoaster ride. You will NOT feel remotely close to being on an adventure ride.   * They need to get a Mortal Kombat game in there... REALLY.   * Needs to be open later ...this is Las Vegas, not some small town in Mississippi. For it to close at 12 AM on Thursdays and Sundays is ludicrous!  We start Pre Gaming at 11 here in Vegas ...   All in all, it's a fun place to go, it does have its flaws and does seem that the negative comments are more linked to the dining area. I do hope they plan on improving to make this an even better experience."}
{"text":"What a crappy place. Broken glass beer bottle in mens restroom, told 2 staff members and nobody picked it up. My wife was served RAW chicken, our food was cold, and wrong. Alot of games not working or dirty. Service is horrible, avoid this place and save yourself from wasting money here. This is the worst , Dave & Busters in Glendale , AZ should get their shit together."}
{"text":"First time ever and best time ever. I had so much service that I couldn't even remember my bartenders name. I had every bartender here helping me out so much. The games were awesome the food was excellent and the service was beyond great! Big shout out to Brad, Jules, Afton & Sean. They were excellent! I've been in the serving and tip industry for about 10 years and I've honestly had the best customer service today that I have ever EVER receivin!!! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Went out to eat with 3 others, I hate the hottie burger with fries since they were out of onion rings. My wife ate the double burger deal with the 10$ play card, my friend got the Mac n cheese and my other friend got chicken strips and Mac n cheese, we all shared the brownie tower ice cream. Left the place around 10pm on this past Sunday night. Around 230-3am my wife and I started getting extremely sick. Violently ill. Never in my life have I felt this way and knew this must be what food poisoning is. I called and notified the manager, he assured me he would submit the report and check the kitchen but that he doubts it the burger cause they have fast turn around in their meat. It is now day 3 of missing work because I became violently ill from their burger plate.  My other 2 friends not sick at all. Will not be going back to this place ever again and will most likely never eat a burger again."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I wish I had time to come here more! (Maybe in the summer.. it seems to be a usual post-Wonderland thing.)  I have been here a few times, always with a large group. The food has been good each time- I have always enjoyed what I have chosen, even when I had Eat-and-Play combos!  My most recent time I went with a group to an event for a company that my work was collaborating with.  We started with a couple of drinks at the bar- the bartender's service left little to be desired, but the drinks were fine. Dinner was good, service was professional and fairly prompt for the large group that I was with.  This is basically adult Chuck-E-Cheese. The fact that the whole point is to drink and then play games is fantastic. It is worth the trip just for this! I wouldn't go all the time, it is definitely more a novelty than anything else, but for what it is, it's excellent. I highly recommend having a few drinks and then playing some Fruit Ninja, or Skee Ball, or whatever you prefer! (My co worker and I had a blast accumulating tickets and choosing prizes at the end!) You need a LOT of tickets for the good prizes, but it is like that everywhere.   I would highly recommend this place for a large group, or for a party. It's most fun when you're with a group of people, and will leave you wanting to go back.  It's not the kind of place I would go regularly, but it is certainly a ton of fun."}
{"text":"I was part of a group, three of which are veterans. This happened on 10/23/17 around 7:30 pm. I feel I have sufficiently cooled off enough to write this review. I asked for the manager on duty that night when the person up front rejected my request for a veteran discount (I had my state issued NV drivers license which stated this as proof). She was not rude but did insist that it must be a military issued id card, per policy. When the manager arrived I explained to them that not all veterans carry their military ids when they get out. I have my DD214, I have my license, I'm good. The state id confirms our status. To my surprise, the manager also insisted on their policy and denied me and the other veterans in our group the discount we otherwise would have gotten. It would have amounted to $2.00 off for each of us, such a small amount to not only avoid this negative experience but earn some goodwill from the veteran community. I personally make it a point to support a business that shows appreciation for veterans and was happily surprised to see the notice at Dave and Busters's area up front. Talk about half commitment! Were it not for the other non-veterans in our group that night, We would not have given Dave and Busters any of our business. Moving forward, I will be sure to avoid them."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and both times the food was mediocre at best. The first time I ordered this pasta dish that was okay but on my recent visit I ordered some hot wings and fries, then shared some mini burgers with my nephew and I can honestly say I won't be going back. I didn't eat half of my food, wings were over cooked, the fries were okay but for as simple as the items were I was hoping they would at least be decent and they weren't."}
{"text":"The worse service I've ever experienced , waiter never brought us water, never  refilled ice tea , took a hour to get food and it was ice cold , sent it back and it took 45 mins later to get the reorder"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on a Tuesday around 1pm. We decided to eat before playing and got the deal that is for food and tokens. We were sat and waited way too long before someone came around (at least 20 mins) and ordered our meals at the same time as our drinks. There was only one other table and the waiter would disappear for very long periods of time. I got the chicken fingers with onion rings and when the food arrived the chicken fingers were extremely tough and chewy, the dipping sauce had a film on top from sitting out too long and the onion rings were nearly burnt. We then waited a good 15-20 mins to pay our bill, which was annoying since we wanted to go to the arcade. When I used the bathroom, almost every stall was dirty or out of order. We arrived at 1pm and they open at 11:30 and it was NOT busy. Clearly no one cleaned the bathrooms from the day before. The games themselves were entertaining and a lot of different choices, which is the only positive of this review, although I found them expensive for the short amount you play on them."}
{"text":"Ok, we went on a sat night with a large party, 2 hour wait for a table. Fine that's understand then it turned to a three hour wait. Once seated we were told the kitchen was THREE HOURS behind and the wait for food would be three hours. The manger blamed us saying \" you came with a large party on a sat night, if you only order apps and not separate  meals, you MIGHT get food in 45 min\" really ? It's the customers fault your staff can't handle a sat night rush. The table of 5 next to us waited 3 hours for food, when they got it it was the WRONG food... I will never spend money here again!!! To top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere!"}
{"text":"too expensive.. food expensive, games expensive.. games take a lot of the cards you buy. I wouldn't go here all the time, just sometimes to have some fun!!"}
{"text":"Gaming and arcade was great and the place was clean. The dining experience was absolutely terrible. We stood next to an open high top waiting for it to be cleared and wiped down for nearly ten minutes. Then once we were seated, we waited another 15 to have our server take our order. The food was brought out by the kitchen and we had split a sandwich. After the sandwich was delivered, we waited another close to five minutes to get silverware. We ended up just going to the bar and asking for silverware ourselves. When the server checked on our food, we asked for a plate since we were splitting and a ranch. My husband ended up eating his half of the sandwich over his napkin at the table because we were never brought a plate. Server came back to table with the ranch after all of our food was gone and we were done. So many other great dining experiences in WESTGATE, I would not recommend dining here again, the gaming experience was great but they need to step up their customer service game big time."}
{"text":"This review is only for the arcade.  I came here with a couple of friends and we bought the four supercharged power cards for $25 each. The lady at the kiosk told us it would last about an hour of play but we ended up staying there around 3 hours in total which was pretty good. There were a handful of broken games but there was a good selection. We were so close to getting a blender (100 tickets away) but we decided we'll get it next time."}
{"text":"Food isn't the best, but it's decent. Games are fun especially basketball. And the watermelon margaritas are delicious! I used to go to D&B back home in the Bay Area to have a drunken good time with friends and I used to wonder why there were so many kids around during the late hours. Well, now I get it! This is a great place to have a drink and entertain the kids. It's like a bar where children are allowed. SO grab a drink, order an appetizer, play some games, keep an eye on your kid, and make sure you have a DD. I guarantee you'll have a good time.   Oh and if you happen to come here with a big group, I suggest ordering your drinks and food from the bar. It will come faster and you'll avoid the gratuity!"}
{"text":"the folks at dave and buster's would be pissed if they heard me say this, but i'm gonna call a spade a spade.  dave and buster's is chuck e. cheese for adults.  minus that thing where you get to jump in a thing of colored balls.  dear dave, and your buddy buster, add the ball playroom.  thanks. oh, and lower your prices.  ya'll are PRICEY."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I found out adults could still play games... in public.. without humiliation.   Although, to my fellow gamers, this is the not the in your own private room with everything in good distance version of playing. This is mainly for groups and/or a cool date.   Friendly tip: make sure you keep the same card you buy initially. When you collect the points , it all stays on the same card. ^_^  When you are finished and ready to go home , guess what? - you get to redeem your points at the little shop section. From a serious d&b addict, here's the best advice - keep collecting the points (and not every game will give you points, so check before hand) . Even if you don't plan on coming back, (Perhaps you are quite ordinary and without the void in life that can only be filled up by playing endless video/arcade games) give the points to somebody else. Like me. ^_^   Tip: The basketball game (shoot and score) on the direct far left side of the main door is usually the best place to score extra points. The machine in the middle is on Acid - it spouts out extra points.  You're welcome.   Open till 2am fri & sat , makes this place the best ever! It's always packed and very much underrated.   Tip: You need I.D here.   There's a huge billiards room, a whole theatre section, a batting cage arena, about 4-5 rooms for separate functions ( stags/birthdays etc) The bartenders are all really nice. They will dose you up quite nice.  You can have a beer in these crazy massive mugs. You will need both hands.   The dinner here is delicious. They offer specials (dinner and play combo) so check it out if you come early to have dinner. Make sure to make reservations.   The steak is usually always tender. Only once did I return it to be cooked some more. The frizzled onions are amazing. Salads are mediocre. The grilled steak salad is a really tiny portion. The wings are good here. Not sharing friendly.  The reason why I return to this magnificent place - they have edemame :) (brownie points)  The servers are quite professional in the dining room.  If you somehow make it to desert - order the Hot Sugared Donut Holes. I've never seen this done anywhere else.   Happy gaming ;)  xoxox M."}
{"text":"Great games, great food, especially the fried shrimp and fries. And the DRINKS! Omg love drinking n playing here."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Go for the beer and games. Service is mediocre at best. The bartender I have seen twice on Wednesdays works verrrry slow. Be prepared"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service we have ever received at a restaurant. The food orders came out over 45 minutes apart from the first to the last meal delivered and they brought out the wrong food twice!! Don't waste your time, go anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"If we are talking about the arcade, it's just an arcade but there's not many in Toronto - at least not that I know of, and nowhere as fun as this one so I would give a five star rating. I definitely recommend it, it's one of my favourite places to go to for dates, birthdays, gatherings, etc. It is family friendly as well! It is also baby friendly as long as you don't pick a crowded night.  Now if we are talking about the dining/bar area...I recommend eating beforehand unless you want to spend an unnecessary and way overpriced amount (double what you would normally spend for basic American food) for good but slow, inattentive service and food. Overall, the food is good but expensive (it's Dave and Busters - don't be surprised). Also, you will hardly be able to get a hold of your waiter. It's a cute and fun environment though, but in my honest opinion you can go to a higher-end restaurant for that kind of bill."}
{"text":"Cool place to bring the kids to play games but not thrilled with the service or the food.  The sever did mention that there were only two servers on so I did expect the service to be a bit slow.  My son ordered the sliders and wings and I ordered the chicken and shirt alfredo.  When we got our food, my sons sliders were dried out but he did enjoy the wings. I got a bowl of mac and cheese instead of my alfredo. I told the server about the mistake and he did apologized for it and said he would have my correct order right away. When my food arrived, it looked and tasted good except for the chicken was a little dry.   Definitely a cool place for drinks and entertainment, not so much for the food."}
{"text":"The games have taken a hit lately, you really don't see super fun games like D&Bs used to be. It used to be a place for guys to go hang out, sadly it's turned into a place for parents to dump their kids"}
{"text":"NEVER GOING BACK EVER. you couldn't pay me to go back here after I was treated. They have a rule where you must be accompanied by an adult to go inside, or be 18. I am 18, they checked my ID at the front desk, I went upstairs, 2 more employees checked it. The third one that did, took it and would not return it, insisting I wasn't 18, and they kicked me out. I am an honor student, and eagle scout. Nobody should be discriminated against like this, this is outrageous, especially cause I eat and play their every month. They need to higher more compitent employees, or drop that rule. I will make sure that none of my friends, family, or anyone else ever goes back. I suggest you don't either, until they have a change in policy."}
{"text":"Food was great but I was overcharged. I spoke with General Manager (Phil) and event planner (Veronica) and both decided I was due my $300 refund. It has been 16 days since I was told this information. I would love to give them another chance, but it should not take this long to rectify a problem. The server was also not very understanding of our group of intellectually disabled individuals. That's a whole other story...."}
{"text":"To say this place is awesome is an understatement. Food, service staff and games are a 10 out of 10! Great place to come and let the kids hang out while I can relax."}
{"text":"I'm kind of upset that I had to give this location a 3 star rating. It's a newer building with lots is space and games but the bathrooms were gross. Someone needs to give those area's alot more attention. Oh and if you are from out of state with a power card from said state you will have to pay a activation fee to use your card. So yeah just a heads up."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible my boyfriend and I waited for 20 minutes while the staff talked and goofed around instead of clearing the numerous tables that needed to be cleaned off. Complained stop staff but ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Went in holding a drink, I have never been before and the girl at the receptionist didn't even say \"Hi Welcome in\" or anything to make me feel welcomed there, she simply pointed to my drink and said \"you cant have that in here\". I get it, no outside drinks, I wasn't even upset about that because, trust me here..I had full intentions on purchasing an overpriced beer. I was upset about how rude the girl was. As for everything else, I would say this place is overrated, but looking at the reviews here (which is something I should have done first) this place does not appear to be rated highly anyways. The service was slow, even on a slow Thursday night and food was mediocre at best. Typical bar food, but my suggestion would be to eat at Buffalo Wild Wings before eating here to play games, if thats the type of food you are looking for. As I said, this was my first time to this place and I can tell you it will for sure be my last. LOTS of improvements all the way around need to be made."}
{"text":"Huge shout out to Dave & Buster's for allowing you to now donate your tickets and/or prizes to Phoenix Children's Hospital!  Love to see local places giving back!  Also, this D&B's is great - really big, helpful staff, tons of games and don't have to wait to play them."}
{"text":"I was hesitant after reading all the reviews and since we were going for Fathers Day, I was a bit apprehensive.  But our experience was great. Good service, tasty food and fun for the grandkids."}
{"text":"Service is next to none. I sat over an hour and half and the waitress did not come by until they actually walked over to her and asked her to come over to take our order. Also, warning!! DO NOT order calamari!! I think I just ate very deep fried super duper crispy fried plastic pieces. **barf!!!**  wtf!!??  Between 2 kids and myself and them playing games and the most disgusting foods wanna be, I spent $200.00. The worst waste but maybe that's how it is in a place like this."}
{"text":"If you have boys ages 6+ this place is ideal. They even have daddy daycare (bar) which really works out great on a Sunday afternoon watching a NFL game while the kiddos have a blast playing the latest arcade games."}
{"text":"This establishment is horrible. The security guard is a pussy. He thinks he's tough but needs to get a real job. Minimum wage not a cop trying to be a hero. Go get laid you virgin."}
{"text":"Fun place to spend some time at every once  in a while. Games can cost a lot to play tho but it's all worth it when you can get a flinstones tie or giant pixie stick for the 50 buck you just paid! They do have fun games for adults however. Odd thing is the hosts downstairs always check mine and my girlfriends id to go upstairs while their letting kids run upstairs without any questions? I'm 25 damnit! I wanna play my games!"}
{"text":"D&B is like a carnival crammed into one building. From the ID check to the arcade area, the whole place is chaotic.   None of the stalls in the ladies' washroom had toilet paper, and the garbage bins were overflowing with dirty paper towels, covering most of the floor. There was puke in one stall and smelly doodoo on the toilet seat of the next stall. Where in the world is D&B's cleaning crew?!   The clientele: So many kids just turned 19 or something and ventured in D&B before clubbing. Loud teenagers kicking/rocking the arcade machines, just to get tickets by shaking down the coins (not sure what this game is called). Well, D&B is crowded with people like this. I don't see the big deal in getting the tickets - with 800 tickets, you win a mug that comes with a lid that doesn't close properly. Other prizes include candy, stuffed animals and Wii (that will cost you around 90,000 tickets).   The floor is strewn in garbage and ticket buckets, unfinished drinks left everywhere. We seated ourselves at a stall, and ordered food/drinks. Our waitress was very pleasant, but the food was pretty darn awful. The burger patties were so dried out, it's like they cooked it last night and dried it in the sun before serving. The buns were cold, and the fries was the only thing hot. All this for around $12! The brownie sundae was  A-OK, and the portion was huge - but how can you go wrong with ice cream and syrup?   Even if you have nothing better to do late at night, getting a headache at D&B won't help you sleep better at night."}
{"text":"Been here several times before. Service is always slow. It seems to be normal. Games are decent. ( nothing like Atlanta, ga). Workers are friendly and helpful. I'll go back  for  happy hour drinks. If you do eat there  ( with no kids) I recommend you sitting at the bar top. Best service because bartenders don't leave the well area. They get busy, but at least they refill your drinks without waiting 20 mind for a server to come around.   was there last night with a group of friends and we were playing air hockey, I set my watch down because  it came loose. Someone snatched it off the table. ( it was a watch my mother gave me before she passed away) I asked every employee there if they saw it. One one gentleman did and he said it  was where I had set it down at.  He went back and it was gone. Called this morning and nothing.  so to the asshole who stole a watch that was by the air hockey game, I'm glad you have it in your heart to steal someone's watch and keep it. I hope someone takes something of yours of value and keeps it too. Your karma will bite you hard in the ass one day.   I want to ask dave and busters to look at the cameras, but being that I work for a large company, they won't do it because it doesn't involve a crime."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's can be good or bad, depends on what you're coming there for.  I've been there multiple times, and I continue to go back, because it's not THAT bad.  But here are the pros and cons:  Pros:  - The games are fun - There's lots of games - The staff are friendly - They show UFC and boxing matches  Cons:  - A lot of the games are frequently out of order - Some of the games are somewhat of a ripoff - they only last 30 seconds - In the restaurant, they seem to be pretty shortstaffed, so wait times are very long (20-30 minutes)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before bike night at Twin Peaks. Not much of a gamer so foond only. When we got there we were the only customers. Yet a trainee had to take our drink order, and when I asked a question he said I needed to wait for the server. As slow as it was not sure why he couldn't come out. He was personable enough. We ordered the walk the plank as it was on special. Very weak, they probably shorted the alcohol by half. I made a coment about it but the server didn't say or do anything about it. I ordered the island triple thing, with steak, chicken, and shrimp. They wouldn't let me substitute a salad and I don't like rice or any of their super carb loaded sides. He didn't ask about how I wanted the steak and it came out well done which I hate. The sauces tasted like crap, and the \"citrus\" rice that I had one bite of had no discernable taste of citrus. The shrimp looked like it was microwaved, no grill marks. Basically this was meat shoved on sticks, and not grilled, probably microwaved or cooked on a flat top. I guess it was my fault, trying to order something leaner at a franchise bar. I probably would have been fine with a burger or chicken sandwich but I'm trying to eat better. Waiter asked if my meal was good, I said it was edible, and at that point as a server he should have gotten an manager but he didn't. I guess he thought I was being sarcastic. Then We ordered beer since the liquor is obviously poured light. I drank my beer and got to the bottom of the glass, and saw a bunch of balck specks. My boyfriends glass was clean, but for all I know it was roach crap on the bottom. I brought it to the manager's attention, and he totally blew it off. He was a kid, too, probably not over 24. They need new management and not some kid. THe thing is if one glass is like that than many of them probably are, and that is not sanitary. It shows lack of attention to detail and cleanliness. The place is rampant with that. Servers were standing around, towel whipping eachother with the sanitary towels for cleaning tables, disgusting. If that is the towel used to clean the tables obviously it isn't clean. I will never ever go back, gross food and clearly not a clean environment. I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. Shame on you, dave and busters, this place is a crap hole!"}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday night for a friends birthday. They said we had to wait 1hr to 1 1/2hr for a table. When we got the call through the Yelp service one of the severs said they don't call (clearly they don't know the procedure). We didn't need to wait 1hr to 1 1/2hr we waited maybe 20 mins. However because we had an extra person so basically 5 to 6 they are saying we are gonna be too tight at the current table. Nonetheless we took it and laughed there was nothing wrong with the table. But then it began we ordered drinks it took 30 minutes. Once they brought drinks we had to order another round cause we knew it was going to take long. The food now was horrendous. I ordered nachos the beef was stale and the guac was brown. The shrimp platter well I'm a shrimp lover and it was rubber. The French fries weren't cooked. My husband's burger wasn't well done his fries weren't cooked. My friends ribs were hard. My other friend meal went to the kitchen twice and still was cold as a dog nose. The trio app platter was cold and salty. The next day the birthday girl got food poisoning. Never Ever again will we ever go back."}
{"text":"We got there around 4:15pm for a holiday party.  The hostess seemed really annoyed that we asked her any questions at all.  The bartender near the bowling lanes was really nice and did a great job.  After bowling, we had to encounter the same hostess.  I'm unsure what was so offputting about getting us a table, but she acted like she had someplace else to be.   Our waiter was nice and checked with us often.  I did ask for lemon to go in my water and he brought it over right away, in his hand........when we brought that to his attention, he went and got another.    We had the 12oz steaks and they were cooked well, and it was not bad for the price. Overall, I didn't hate it."}
{"text":"I never really had any desire to come here, but then our Senior week at CWRU included a trip here as one of the events. I actually enjoyed myself a lot! The beer was a bit pricey, but it didn't turn me off to the place; I figured if I never come here again, at least I can say I did once, drank beer, and played arcade games.  I think the concept of having an adult arcade is fun and exciting, but be prepared to pay for this luxury. It's easy to lose money on this type of thing and it doesn't help that the drinks are expensive.  Like I said, I never had any desire to come here before, but I'm glad I did once. Maybe next winter I'll go again just for something to do during the 9 months of unpleasant weather we have."}
{"text":"Gave 5 stars for the arcade/gaming area. Always kept clean, bartenders nice and attentive and games kept in order. However, I'd give the restaurant itself 2 stars as we stopped eating there. Service is incredibly slow all the time- when they have a few tables or only a couple. Last time I had to flag down the host to let the server know we were seated. Then we didn't get our drinks until our food came. It's not the first, 5th or 10th time we've had bad experiences at the restaurant so we just gave up. Overall tho Dave and busters is great to go to esp on Wednesday's and for happy hour!"}
{"text":"D&B has Wednesday Havana Nights on their roof top patio!  With temps dropping down, it was great to start the free lesson at 7p followed with dancing at 8p.  Most of the crowd is probably the ASU salsa class and friends, as its their instructor leading the lesson.  That said, it is a very friendly and comfortable atmosphere... I didn't see any of the die hard salseros, so perhaps they left this venue for the newer, fresher crowd.  Great place to take beginners to medium level.  DJ also played bachata!!!"}
{"text":"Never again! What a waste of money! My son graduated from high school and we decided to celebrate at Dave & Buster. Making the plans was great with the manager, Laura; and I figured it was going to be a great place to celebrate my first born's accomplishment. Our package included food and game cards for everyone; as well as a sectioned off corner of the place. At first, the man that greeted me was really nice; but when I went to give him complain about the food being cold- he completely changed. Mind you, everyone is traveling from out of town. Everyone is hungry and ready to eat. The fries were cold and nasty; chicken bites cold; pizza bites cold; Mac and cheese cold..and the soda pitchers all contained watered down soda. I asked him when was the food set out and he said it was set out 6-10 minutes before we arrived. Lies. So he replaced some of the items. When I went to pay, I told him I will not be paying the entire \"suggested tip\"; as I was not very happy with the service and his attitude and once again, he proceeded to give me an attitude telling me about all the discounts he had given me due to my complaint. Excuse me? There's no discount in the world that could fix the way he was talking to me and their nasty, cold food! So, the next day or so, I emailed Laura; who apologized to me and said she would get back to me within a day or two of talking to the host. Three weeks have past and Laura has not gotten back to me. Case closed. Never again."}
{"text":"Updating because we went back just for the games, as I certainly would never put myself through the bizarre and gross experience of dining with them again.   It was a half price Wednesday, so it was busy. We waited in line to get our play card and use our coupon. The guy at the counter looked at me like I had two heads when i showed him the coupon on my phone. He took my phone from me and kept it behind the counter for the entire transaction, even when he was done with it, which I found odd. He also made sure to touch me with his creepily long fingernails as much as possible throughout our transaction, which was more often than you'd think.   He couldn't figure out how to use the coupon, he also couldn't figure out how to ask anyone for help.   Wednesdays are cheaper but also super busy, and we had to wait for most games we wanted to play.  Ordered a couple beers from the small bar on the game floor, and the bartender was unfriendly and kind of a douche, so that was fun.  I mean, this place is absolutely no better than gameworks.  Its also deafeningly, ear bleeding loud in there so its hard to carry on a conversation.  Uggggggh Dave and busters, you could have been so awesome, but right now you aren't even mediocre. Management clearly doesn't read the reviews, or if they do, they don't care."}
{"text":"Service was good until the sandwich I ordered didn't come with bread (?!). I can't eat dairy and don't eat meat so I ordered the veggie sandwich without cheese. Turns out their bread has dairy so they literally just brought me sautéed veggies on a plate. Server didn't even bother to ask if I wanted to order anything else prior to it being served. I would think you would let your customers know if there are going to be any changes to the food prior to it being served. You guys need to roll out a vegan menu, even if it's just one item. Not only for vegans but for people who have allergies to eggs, dairy, fish, etc."}
{"text":"This is a tough place to rate because the restaurant gets 3 stars from me but the arcade area is (obviously) the best part.  This is a good place to bring a group but I wouldn't want to come here to spend quality time with someone. The restaurant is a large area which is good and you don't have to wait terribly long, even if you have a large party in most cases.   The menu is ridiculous in the sense that everything is super over the top. You get good things and bad things from that. I ordered a turkey burger thinking that- by the looks of their other burgers, it would be one to remember. It was just \"meh\" and honestly something I could have made at home. I would have rather gone with something more ridiculous like a Mac and cheese burger or whatever it was they had.   My suggestion: go with something that is pictured on the menu. (Turkey burger was not.)  The drink selection is more focused on crazy drinks like a sno cone with an upside down Corona in it and something that glows in the dark and has been blessed by a unicorn. The wine selection was slim so this is more of a place where I would stick with beer.  The service was overall an 8/10 because it wasn't awe inspiring but you have to hand it to them because they are servicing so many people!  As for the games: my husband and I spent the $29 for 170 play points (I might be a little off on the points but I'm right about the price) and that was a perfect amount for us to play. There's a bunch of games that give you ticket rewards and a bunch that don't, which you don't know until you're done."}
{"text":"The people that work the bar are always really nice but there is always only one person working the bar which is completely ridiculous. It takes at least 10-20 minutes to get a drink order or your tab closed out because of this. Pls hire more bartenders!"}
{"text":"Dirty sticky menus and table, waitress was constantly nowhere to be found and she was not helpful, order was done improperly (raw meat) so my family ate while I sat there starving .. and they were off playing while I sat and ate my lunch by myself once it finally came. Pasta undercooked, gross green tomatoes and old lettuce on my salad ..  I told the waitress and she just smiled and said she doesn't deal with that stuff, that's the cooks. You would think the waitress would offer some kind of small discount considering they tried to serve me raw meat, and I ended up having to eat lunch by myself while my family played games, but no. Needless to say I did not tip her. Way overpriced and crappy place. If they don't even clean the menus or the tables, I guarantee there is so much human bacteria on all of those games ...and I shudder to think how gross the kitchen must be. There is no sanitation standard in that place.  Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"This location is inside the marketplace, this was a perfect place to get out of the heat for a little and entertain the kids for about an hour.  They don't charge for their Air Conditioning.  Location was a pretty typical D&B layout, lots of different variety of games, seems like they generally place the larger interactive hoops, skeeball, carnival games on the outer edges, more video games centralized.  Plenty of walking space between and around games, and lots of flashing lights to woo the children - and some adults.  As with all of them, I kind of miss the instant gratification of rewards (machine spitting  out a couple tickets), but I get it - we should be going green.  But how about some alarms and more flashing lights?  Good entertainment for the family and even for about an hour of playing you can still find your way to the WIN zone and redeem your winnings for small trinkets.  We did have an issue with a game, and could not find anyone walking around to help us, eventually we just gave up."}
{"text":"Great service! It was a pleasure speaking with Mr Remi May. He gave me all information I needed. Thank you for your great service."}
{"text":"I gave D&B 4 stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice! The place has definitely changed over the years, becoming a very pricey venue. The food was mediocre. The fries were cold and the sliders were subpar, almost like White Castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores. My buffalo wings were rather tough. As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer 'app' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines. But, wow, we went through $50 of games really fast. The gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points! Nevertheless, it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family, friends or coworkers."}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughter' milestone 19th birthday here on August 1st. We had a party of nine people. The food was better than I expected. The Philly Cheese Steak was outstanding and filling, the French fries were warm. Jessica our server was attentive. She brought the wrong beer, but we took it anyways and she was apologetic.  Buy the play and eat plan as it is the better deal.  Went to Zach to purchase our game tokens/cards. Friendly and pleasant to deal with. Answered all my questions about the game deals they were offering.  When we went to redeem our points for prizes, the prize we wanted \"dancing water speakers\" was behind a locked cabinet. Stacey and Alexis were very helpful. They had to call a manager who had the keys to the locked prizes. They had to call him three times on the radio and after 20 minutes of waiting for a manager to show up, they had to physically go and find him. I wonder how fast his ass would move if  they told him I was having a heart attack. These two young ladies kept apologizing to me, when it wasn't their fault.  A manager named Carlos appeared with another gentlemen. I told him I was waiting for now over 20 minutes and his staff had called him three times and had to physically go and find him. No apology provided, just an excuse of, \"I just got the call\". \"No one came to find me\". Love the manager's customer service of an apology for keeping me waiting.  When he provided me with my daughter's prize, he knew how irate I was and said, \"sorry\". Little too late. I feel sorry for the line employees who have to deal with management's slow response when they need them. Also, if the games don't work and you lose your tokens, don't bother finding anyone working on the floor or assisting you quickly. That took another 10 minutes. The washrooms need to be cleaned more often too."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences i've ever had. The server was slow and unattentive throughout the whole experience. Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, and food took over an hour. Our appetizer arrived with our meals. Everything was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Was in the area and knew this Dave & busters just opened recently so my wife and me stopped for lunch. Walked in and all the people in front were leaning on their elbows and not one person greeted us. There were no long lines and you would think they would go out of their way to help. We finally made our to the dining area with no ones help and the 2 people working at the desk did not even greet you. The guy finally led us to a booth and we asked if we could have a different table away from the noise. The guy looked at us as if this would be too much trouble. As he was leading us to another table, we turned around and started to leave. As we were leaving, a girl at the front said have a nice day and come back soon. We then told her that the people in this place all seemed to have bad attitudes and have no skills on how to treat people. This place will never make it with employees like this."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go spend family time again in the Summerlin mall location. Games are over priced for locals, staff in the front are not consistent with what's policy, and staff is not kid friendly so don't take your kids. Food wise, I was told not worth the price so I didn't even try, because Shake Shack was in the mall."}
{"text":"Came here for a day time work function, not the greatest but not the worst. Could use more dedicated servers as on several occasions I was looking for a server for over 5-10 minutes. No salt pepper at lunch, no knifes, no coffee cups, had to clear my own table after dishes sitting there for over an hour."}
{"text":"My review today is mainly going to be about food and the dining area.   We go play a lot so we had lots of tickets to redeem. We decided to redeem some of them on the food vouchers. And we have done this twice.   The first time was not that bad. The server was nice and we found a comfortable seat. She was prompt and everything came quickly. Nothing special about the food though, average at best but hey it was free. We had the spinach dip and calamari.   Second time we were there, it was pretty bad. Everything was disgusting at the table. Not a single clean item to touch. It were little chunks on all the plates, knives and forks. We had to go around to other tables and find some that were decently clean. If we didn't buy the vouchers already there's no way we would have stayed there to eat. So disgusting....   I don't think we'll ever eat there again. Maybe redeem something to go. But I could never eat there again because I can't trust that they clean anything."}
{"text":"Saturday night. I have never seen a less motivated crew. It's like they are all stoned and moving in slow motion even though the place is packed. No sense of urgency."}
{"text":"O haven't been here in some time however I stopped in there with my buddy we grabbed a quick beer and a bite to eat eat they also newly renovated the restaurant area and it looks very nice. If you've never been to Dave & arcade a lot of fun! Kind of like an adult Chuck-E-Cheese"}
{"text":"We went last so we didnt eat much. I ordered the edammane and it somehow took an hour. I asked the waiter and he said the cooked just \"forgot\" it. Needless to say I was annoyed but it was still good with the drinks.  The pools tables were all busy and most of the games were occupied. If we had been able to play it would have been more fun.  Over all for a fun night out for drinks and laughs I would go here.  The staff is nice and the bartenders are hot ;)   We we go back for a full night out I will detail more."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews. Me and my family have been here a lot of times and we haven't had 1 single bad experience. My daughters love Dave & Busters. They always say it's their favorite place in Las Vegas. The games are awesome and they have a big selection. Yeah it might be a little pricey but it's definitely worth it compared to other arcade like places. And the food and drinks are good. I always get the Philly cheesesteak and my wife gets the Buffalo wings and we have never had any problem. They are really good. I usually switch it up when it comes to alcoholic drinks and have liked them all. 1 thing I would say that they should try to get a little better on is ringing customers up faster that are on the regular line. It does take awhile even if the lines aren't long."}
{"text":"Just came here to check it out. The atmosphere is nice since being new but service is lacking kinda what others are saying but mostly  very slow in getting in and out of there. Our server didn't seem like she wanted to be there at all just by her demeanor."}
{"text":"Who's running this place?? Staff is almost non existent and the ones that are around are quite rude... cool place but needs some good management to get this staff in check"}
{"text":"The service here is rather poor. The waiter for our table was decent. However, I went to the bar to order a drink and stood there for a while. One of the waitresses made eye contact with me three different times but continued to ignore me. I feel she could have at least said, \"I'll be with you shortly\" but she did nothing. Then, I went to the manager who was also behind the bar and asked him if there was a specific spot I should be standing in order to get waited on and he became irritated and said, \"what do you want?\" I guess they forget who their paychecks come from. Needless to say, I will not return here."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok yall!!! Im here at D&B again! Im so fortunate to have STACEY STACEY again! She remembered me.  This time im dining alone. She suggested the SALMON! WWWWHHHHAAAAATTTTT!!!!! talk about awsome.. nice portions grilled!!!! Topped with garlic butter. DELISSSSSHHHH! Stacey has come by and checked on me four times AND she's busy busy!!!! Shes the reason for my returned visit... its sooooooo many folks here.. but she checks on me!! What a nice lady!!! The best server ive had in vegas!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What an awful experience... First we were sat at a dirty table, then had to wait for about 15 minutes before the writer came. While we were waiting we all went to the bathroom and they were so disgusting we decided not to eat their. We were all very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with a few coworkers yesterday and this place really far.  It's in a very busy mall with the theater and restaurants so parking wasn't easy.  I was very disappointed when I got there at 9:30 because as soon as I  walked in I immediately saw little kids and teenagers!!! Kids running around unsupervised and teenagers  nothing but into  their phones in the way and in the way where the adults couldn't play games.  I only got to enjoy 1 drink which was the TNT and wasn't strong and comes in a really small glass.  They don't have the prices on none of their drinks or food. Strange that a restaurant wouldn't have prices so you'll know before ordering.   I've always thought they kicked you out if you weren't over 21. Even though it's the only one in Vegas, I probably won't be retuning because kids & teenagers everywhere are a deal breaker for me.  I was very annoyed and couldn't enjoy myself. If I wanted to be around kids and teenagers I would have went to Chuck E Cheese or John's Incredible Pizza. Ugh what a waste of time and gas."}
{"text":"Ha! Where do I even start? Well, I'll start off by saying I went with my boyfriend, cousin, & her boyfriend. We sat at our table in the dining room ordered waters. It took 15 minutes for just water. Let me also note, I used to be a server so I know how this is supposed to work. Anyways, we then order drinks appetizers & our food all at once because it took the server so long with our waters. I ordered a \"purple people eater\" martini. This martini was supposed to have sugar on the rim, which it did not. The drink itself was terrible & too strong. Our drinks took over ten minutes every time we ordered. We then waited and waited. An hour later we received all the food, appetizers & entrees, except for my cousins boyfriend. He received COLD appetizers, so sent it back. My pasta was cold & bland. For an $18 entree, I expected more. So moving on, he had still not received his food. We had finished our meals & finally ten minutes after we had finished he received his food. His appetizer came last which obviously he didn't want anymore. The servers had no idea about the menu or the drink menu when we had any questions. I asked for penne pasta instead of linguini & of course, the server didn't even bother come telling me it wasn't available. We noticed a group of 4 ladies come in 20 minutes after we did & received everything about 30 minutes before we did. Nothing was right. We finally asked for a manager. This ALSO took a whole 20 minutes. we discussed everything with her, she then apologized and said she would see what she could do and come back. This is now 3 hours into this dinner & we stil waited for the manager. I asked about 3 more times and finally got her to come back. They took some things off the bill, but honestly I was still not satisfied. Our night was basically ruined and more annoying than anything. This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Management was awful, food was medicore, & service was beyond excruciating. I will never go back nor recommend anyone to go here to eat. We played a few games after and left. I would only recommend the games."}
{"text":"Saturday night, 8:00, they had what I can only describe as a bald headed bouncer at the only door open who wasn't letting anyone in unless they pre-purchased a game card. I didn't want to play games, just wanted to  have a drink and bite to eat. Since this was my first try at visiting D & B...I won't be back. This place will never make it with policies like what they were pulling tonight."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Dave and Buster's but I wasn't allowed in with my doggie bag from Maggiano's. Pretty ignorant management. No wonder the last one in Las Vegas folded."}
{"text":"Glorified fast food. Shit service. Crap bar. Smells like dish water. And no one gives a fuck. But the new bowling games are lit ;)"}
{"text":"The only reason I go to Dave and Buster's is to kick ass at the trivia game show. It is insanely fun to knock your gentleman caller down a peg or two by kicking his butt at all things trivia.   Overall, Dave and Buster's is a nice chage of pace bar/arcade to stumble around once or twice a year. I get depressed there during the summer because there are no windows. It is more of a winter place for me. There are so many fewer options for date night during the winter in Cleveland and Dave and Buster's can help switch things up."}
{"text":"Had a couple pretty bad experiences here for lunch with slow service and undercooked meat. Our server that time was pretty rude about it when we sent it back and acted like it was our fault somehow. We've since taken it off the list for business lunches. The game room is pretty fun though when you're looking to kill a little time on a rainy day."}
{"text":"My daughter and I was there last night great place to relax and spend time together and play games. We also had dinner the food is better than you would expect from a high end arcade yes this is an arcade but well managed and a nice family atmosphere we have returned here time after time you need to consider what this place is before you write negative comments"}
{"text":"if you never been to Dave and busters what fun you will have with the kids go on Wednesday's because the games are half off still expensive but worth it for them do the eat and play so it even cheaper basically for 15 buck you get food and a ten dollar game card so if you ate somewhere else you would pay ten buck for the food so you basically get five bucks for free and it's half price day so well worth it the food is OK nothing grate but good time for fair price"}
{"text":"Ohhhh helllll noooo! (In my black chick voice). Let me put a few positives into the air. I loved the area it was in. It was surrounded by restaurants and shops which is my type of area. I liked the games. I whipped my bf's butt in connect four twice lol. But I do not recommend eating here. Well I won't say that but be careful what you order. We started off with two scooby snack drinks. It had way too much alcohol in it. Thought I was going to fart powdered alcohol or something. I ordered the short rib and Mac&cheese sandwich with tots. The cheese separated from the macaroni so I was eating bland noodles on top of cold short rib which was odd because the bread was warm. Like the cheese had enough of the macaroni's crap so it packed its stuff and slept on the couch at the short ribs house...that's how pathetically bad it was. The tots weren't so bad. The bf had the chicken lime pasta dish and he hated it. So we munched on my tots (hahahahahahaha sounds hilarious when blurted out loud in a store) and paid the check. There was so much food left over and the server could tell we were not satisfied. Just beware of what you order"}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends tonight celebrating a fellow Capricorn's bday. I love Dave & Busters because I get to play!  YAY!  The Nascar Race Cars were SO much fun to play with friends!  Didn't eat dinner, (I had already eaten) but my friends said they enjoyed their food.  I had a Long Island Peach Tea at the table and the Copacabana Colada during game time.  Both were good, but they definitely are light with the alcohol in their drinks which is where they lost one star.  I rarely have two drinks in one night!  Wonderful, helpful staff!  Can't wait to come back to play some more and to experience the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come to D&B to have a fun night out - food and games! I have been to this location before, but had never sat down to dine. Believe me, I will never eat here again.   The food is more or less what you'd expect, classic American with okay flavor. However, the service was abhorrent. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because my friends enjoyed their meals. I had to remind the waitress three times to place a drink order for me and twice more that we had placed an order for an appetizer (an appetizer which came after we had received our meals).   Honestly, our waitress is who ultimately killed this experience for me. It was the first time, while dining, I contemplated asking for a manager. When we inquired about our pending food/drinks, we were met with sarcastic, off-color comments that were truly inappropriate for the situation.  If you do decide to come here for the food, lower your service expectations. And go with friends that can distract you from the extended wait time."}
{"text":"We were at the dining area inside the arcade.. literally a mess. We originally just wanted to grab some drinks after playing a few games. Although i've been to Dave & Buster's quite a few times, i've never purchased anything off their food/drink menu (We were there during the day). If you haven't been here before, it is a huge arcade with a bar/dining area smack in the center. Overall, it was just confusion. Not a single employee was to be seen. Not knowing how this place works for food, I kept trying to look for somebody to assist us. Theres so many seats available, ready for customers. But.. do we sit? Is there a server? Will they know were here? Confusing right? I mean.. we finally found one guy, and he told us to sit at the bar for drinks. Okay. We sat there for 10 whole minutes and not a single soul in the bar. Couldn't he notify the bartender? Or anyone? Finally, a server took our order. The bartender came back shortly after that and went straight to the man sitting next to us to ask how hes doing, and left. Clearly, she saw us sitting there and could care less to see if we were doing okay. Overall this place is a mess. EXTREMELY understaffed and the menus are disgusting. Although the servers arranged them nicely, set up the table nicely, they are still filthy! Sticky and oily! Sigh.   One good thing to say is that the drink we finally got: Watermelon Coronarita was great. Not worth the trouble though."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening. We decided to eat first before we played games. We were pleasantly surprised that they had all day food specials! Every single one of their *many* TVs had sports games playing on them. The dining area was packed.  The place is seat yourself and as soon as we chose a table we were quickly greeted by our server. He was very attentive and understanding to some altered food requests that we had.  I'm unfortunately on a diet so I stuck to a water, lettuce wraps, and a house salad for dinner. I was super envious of my hunnys food (pictured) and had to steal a few bites that were definitely against my diet.  Afterwards we played some very fun games. Dave & Busters never dissapoints us! They have deals on ticket points to purchase to buy to play. When you purchase up front at the kiosk the employees always make sure you get the most bang for your buck.  I've never had a bad time here and it is part of our regular date night rotation."}
{"text":"Glad to see it's calmed down here since going when they first open. We found a table right away on a Saturday night and had fast and friendly service the whole time we were there. The food was delicious, especially the Mountain O' Nachos, and the drinks were affordable. I think the tower of beer was like $30, and shots of Crown were $7.99. Not bad for being out in Vegas. So many fun game choices that my kids loved, and the ticket center has really cool stuff for them! Much better than the options at places like Chuck E Cheese. A great time for kids and adults."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Food is expensive typical pub food. Nothing special.  Waited over an hour to find a seat in the gaming room (\"midway\"). Also equally long wait in their dining room. Came here on a Saturday night. Place is busy, under staffed. I saw people trying to flag a waiter down to pay their bills, we on the other hand waited over 1/2 hr to have our dirty table cleared before we can even order food. Staff unfriendly and even advice we should play more games and come back after a while for the table to be cleared. I mentioned if we did this we would loose our table. Wait staff didn't care. After 1/2 hr wait and nobody came to clear our dirty table from previous guests, we got up and left. They apparently don't care as they are far too busy to care about giving you service.   I would suggest going on a weekday if you must come to this place. I on the other hand would never return."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the boyfriends birthday with friends and it was a good time. If it wasn't for the games I wouldn't go back. We ate some appetizers and shared some entrees at there restaurant and the blonde hostess was very rude. My friend and I stood there while she was looking down for about 5 minutes before I said hello and than she threw the menus down when we were seated and said here. The food did come out vey quick which was nice but it wasn't anything special it just was good to balance out the alcohol. Overall we will definitely eat elsewhere before we go there again but there games are great!"}
{"text":"Severely disappointed after my most recent visit with friends. I've usually had positive/ neutral experiences, but this was unusually unprofessional behavior/ conduct. To begin, it was disappointing when people who came to the bar AFTER us were served with their beverages substantially before us while we had been waiting and were blatantly ignored (age discrimination?). Additionally closing out our tab, we were double charged for the drinks, first as separate drinks listed than as the entire drink tally in total!! Not to mention our drink order was wrong 2x!! {this may be understandable if they were busy, but unfortunately it was just a result of carelessness and lack of enthusiasm from the bartenders} Furthermore... there was a very RUDE/ harassing crew member who snidely mocked us taking photos and proceeded to stare us down until we felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave.  The drinks were as expected and the half price game Wednesday's is always a great deal But after this experience it'll probably be some time until we return when D&B decides to better invest in employee conduct and service."}
{"text":"I went to Dave and busters for the first time. And I was extremely disappointed.  My order was incorrect.  Then I tried to eat the ribs that were served to me, it was so rubbery and the sauce was not good at all.  I was told it was BBQ sauce but it tasted like teriyaki sauce. My server noticed I wasn't eating my food and asked how it was I honestly told him I couldn't eat it.  I'm not one to complain about my food but it was just terrible.  So my server brought me some buffalo hot wings and they were just as bad.   We ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they weren't bad but I just wanted the beer not a cocktail."}
{"text":"Visited the new Dave and Busters in Downtown Summerlin Mall. We arrived right when they opened the doors at 1000 am. No wait, no crowd. The games were new and clean. Seemed a bit more pricey than others I have visited in other states.  I didn't eat, just brought my kids to play games. I would return but not for a while."}
{"text":"The food is really nothing special. In fact it's kind of bland. The drinks are just drinks. Again theres nothing totally great about it!  Playing pool is fun and there is always an open table.  The location is good and it's fun to play games when you are tipsy.  It's good times there but noting super awesome."}
{"text":"Mother's day around noon.  Not a big crowd at all.  Seated quickly, and watched several servers walk around talking and laughing, basically anything but taking our order.  After about ten minutes I asked the hostess who seated us if we were in the wrong section or something as our drink order hadn't even been taken yet.  She apologized and sent a server right over who seemed 'just thrilled' to take our order.  Food arrived twenty minutes later and was okay.  When did the goldfingers become just regular chicken fingers?  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's is essentially a chuck-E-Cheese for adults. It can be frequented by children, and will usually be packed with families on the weekend days, but after 9 pm, it is 19+. There are pool tables (I believe), private party rooms, and a huge midway-type section full of classic ticket play games like skee ball and plastic horse racing (guided by water streams shot from a plastic gun), hoops, big wheel, trivia games and video games, both new and high tech, and older familiar games.  This was definitely a place I enjoyed for birthdays, and the bar in the middle of the play area was a big help, but otherwise it was too out of the way to frequent regularly, at least for me. I would come back, but probably for another birthday."}
{"text":"I went to Dave & Buster's for the first time last night for a bachelor's party.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience.    Food I found the food enjoyable, yet not extremely high quality.  My chicken was overcooked, yet some of the guys said their steak was cooked perfectly.  I don't drink, and they lack a huge variety of non-alcoholic drinks.  However, the bar did look fully stocked.  Service When we were called for our table, the hostess seemed very agitated and wasn't very friendly.  I understand they were busy, and it is VERY loud inside, but good service is still important.  Our waiter was very helpful, and was very quick.  They also continue to serve you at the billiards tables and in the bowling lanes, and the service in those places was exceptional.  Games Playing pool and bowling are both priced per hour.  They are reasonably price IF you have more than 3 or 4 people in your group.  Otherwise it seemed a little expensive.  I had mixed experiences with the arcade games.  There were many games that were completely dead, and many others that didn't function properly.  We did, however, have quite a bit of luck on the strictly ticket-winning games.  Many of the games are also overpriced in my opinion.  Overall, it's a very fun atmosphere, for people of all ages.  I recommend bringing a group of friends, as otherwise it will seem quite expensive, and be wary, talking can be difficult, as it is very loud inside.  Once again, good atmosphere, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"My honey begged me to try this place and I'm happy I did!  We chose to sit in the back Restraunt because it was warmer and more quiet.  Good was amazing, I thought price was high but quality is good.  Can't wait to go try dessert!"}
{"text":"We visited Dave & Buster's on a week night, so it was not very crowded. The dining room was clean and organized. The server was polite, efficient, and business-like. I ordered the Parmesan garlic chicken Caesar salad. It was prepared with fresh greens, croutons, and shaved Parmesan cheese. It was topped with chicken strips that were a bit dry and over-cooked. The Buster's Cheeseburger was cooked as requested. It was accompanied by lukewarm, lightly seasoned fries.   An employee came to our table and offered to take our picture, put it in a key chain, and give it to us free of charge \"as a holiday promotional gift from Dave & Busters\". After we agreed and the picture was taken, we were told by the employee that he \"works for tips\", no longer making the free gift free!  The arcade was extremely large, with much room for movement. Although a bit pricey, the games were well maintained and were lots of fun!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. The games were pricey and they only give you three options for prices. What happened to putting in the amount we wanted? The food was iffy. And disturbingly pricey for my taste. I mean I get it. It's bar food. At a bar. With an arcade. So they have to make money somehow. I however do not recommend going in on a Sunday unless you really like football. They servers were all over the place. We waited 45 minutes from the last time our waiter checked on us just to get a box and a check. Go during the week when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this location for years, and I'm not sure what happened but it just seems like most of the waiters and waitresses upstairs act like they hate their job. The last couple times the service has been horrible. The last time we were at this location (this evening) we were at our table for a good amount of time.. We had two booths upstairs for a birthday party. In the three hours we were there I had my water refilled ONCE. Took forever to get out bill, waitress went MIA over and over...There is one awesome waiter, not sure his name, dark hair with a beard...he is always very attentive, and very nice. Props to him, give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"Everything else was good besides our server Sammie! He's not good at greeting, taking orders or even remembering one out of his two tables were there. First off when you first walk up to a table you as a customer are expected to get greeted ... Not with Sammie he walked up and stared at us expecting us to greet him apparently. I never just been stared at and had to start off the service. If it wasn't for the mangers and another server names Alexis we would of probably just got up and left at this point. Everything from the greeting to the drinks from the food and service was a horrible experience. Sammie defiantly needs more training , seems like we were the first he was the first table we waited on. Also I never felt so disrespected .. He never acknowledge me and only the guy I was with !! Hopefully they step up their game."}
{"text":"The staff was slow with food and drinks and kept forgetting orders. And about half the games were out of order. Not sure if it was a bad night or what but that's the input"}
{"text":"We had a great time! Everything was bright and clean. The food was decent and the drinks were great. Great selection of games and prizes! My only wish is that the servers were a little more attentive. I definitely recommend this place for a good time for the whole family."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's together can fill your entiere day.  We arrived around 1:00pm and did not leave until almost 7pm.  To me this place is a man oasis.  You can take a break away from the stores, get a beer eat some food, and watch the game.    There is a bowling alley, a full service restaurant, a seperate bar, poot table lounge, and many video games.  I think the cost for this amount convenient entertainment is well within reason.  I enjoy Dave & Buster's and wish there was one near my home."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten lunch here twice in recent months because our Edwards Jones financial advisor hosts investor meetings with a presentation and meal in one of the large meeting rooms.  Quite frankly, I would not eat here otherwise.  Dave and Busters is an arcade recreation center and not a place for fine dining. The food was okay, but the service was poor. For example, the staff did not bring out ketchup until most of us had finished our meal. While my wife enjoyed her chicken salad, my double cheese burger was dry and not up to the quality of Burger King. The desserts were pleasing to the eye but nothing special.  Apparently the staff does not expect patrons to drink coffee with their dessert because few mugs were available.  The staff took 10 minutes or more to search for and locate paper cups for the coffee.  By that time, Linda and I were heading out the door."}
{"text":"Worst service ever , they literally took 20 minutes to bring our drinks and the waitress never came to check on us or asked us for a refill . All the workers are just gathered at the front talking and ignoring the customers ."}
{"text":"We decided to do dinner at a different place a few nights ago and tried Dave & Busters.  The menu was nice, however, they didn't warn when one of our party requested no onions on an item that onions are automatically part of a sauce.  They did try to make it right when it was pointed out to them, which was most appreciated.  Overall, for a place that is more fast food-like, it wasn't bad.    I'd go again."}
{"text":"Walked in and you see the associates behind counter talking to themselves, we walked on and sat on a booth. It was loud of course. Food is good, waiters and waitresses were warm and kind. Fast service with food. Busser boys walk around in a daze, no smile. They glance and keep walking. At times they come swooping for empty plates lol. Very robotic. The guy that brought our first appetizer wasn't our waitress. He must work in the kitchen. He walked like a robot and expressionless and handed us the plate of nachos. It was weird. Would I go back? Hmm..."}
{"text":"Any arcade where you can take your kids AND drink is good in my book!  Like most of the other arcade type restaurants (Peter Piper, Chuck E Cheese), you pay out the butt for the games.  Then you earn squat on tickets which  you have to collect about a million to trade in for anything decent.  They make a mean raspberry mojito!"}
{"text":"We had a blast in the arcade today. Lots of fun things to play for people of all ages. Workers were extremely helpful getting our card set up and gave us a military discount. The flow of the arcade was nice and we really didn't have to wait to play the games we wanted. If you want to feel like a kid again, come here! Perfect place for a fun date night."}
{"text":"This location used to be great. Now you get rude bartenders who spill your drink all over the place only to leave YOU to clean it up (after 1/2 of it is on the table) and never offer you another drink, and the techs are never around to fix the frequently broken games. I was there on a saturday at 5 and with the place pretty crowded over 1/2 the games were broken! Skip this one and go downtown."}
{"text":"My hubby ordered the buffalo chicken burger and I ordered the salmon.  Best meal we've had in a long time.  Our server, Daniel was excellent!  We walked around after we ate to see what all the fuss was about.  Very loud but it was nice to see all the families having a good time.  Can't wait to bring the grandkids!"}
{"text":"10 minutes before anyone came to our table to say hello and offer drinks. Another 10 minutes of waiting for those drinks. There was 3 other tables in the dining room. Servers walk so slow. If they put a little pep in their steps they could maybe provide good service. My husbands food came out first he asked for ranch and got blue cheese asked for ranch again. My kids food and my food didn't come out for 15 minutes after my husbands food once our food came out he finally got his ranch. Ribs were alright wings taste like they come from a gas station. Waited forever for our check. My two stars goes to the games and the employees at the winners circle because that is the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"Probably one of the favorite spots my boyfriend and I go to when we have extra time in our busy schedules! We have a few games that we love to play and have our friendly competitions.   Their food is actually pretty good. I've never had a \"bad order.\" I love their spicy habanero sauce that comes with the pretzel dogs and I literally ask for it with any food we order.  The only thing I don't like about the place is the fact that you can't order more than 1 alcoholic beverage at a time. During one visit, we got there 10 minutes before Happy Hour was over so I wanted to order as many drinks as I wanted to drink at a low price but I was told that I couldn't do so because we weren't allowed to share drinks amongst each other (even though we were all over 21 and I wasn't going to shaee)."}
{"text":"Went bowling with some friends, and we had a great time. The service wasn't always the best, they only had one bartender/server, and one person running the bowling alley, so we had to wait on drinks as well as any problems we had with the lane.  We went upstairs and played some games, and that was fun as well. Love the variety of games they have.  Their drinks and food however, was overly priced. We spent more money on drinks and food than on the games, and we were playing for over 3 hours! We will only go back when we can afford an expensive night out, which will be rare, especially since I would rather have a nice meal for the same price of playing drinking here."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing outing for me and my family. It's the smallest D&B I've visited compared to Concord NC, 2 locations in Atlanta area.  The food was undesirable; looked nothing liked the pictures on menu and didn't meet the price either. 1 Mountain nachos were small nachos missing items 2 Hawg loaded cheese fries only had ground beef & cheese looked nothing like picture missing items 3 Candy chill a little short on the Gumby worms 4 They didn't want honor $3 margarita that was advertised on there webpage so they had no alcohol in drinks at all 5 Waiter appeared to be unfamiliar with his job in general , couldn't explain prices nor menu 6 Spinach dip and chips; the chips were way to salty  7 Manager came to table and stated what she couldn't do ; there was no customer service or satisfaction   To spend $166 plus $108 for 4 $25 cards   We will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible we had a party of 11 and 3 of the orders were wrong forgot to bring out the correct orders we had to wait an hour and a half for a steak in 30 minutes for order fries then the waiter ask me to explain the bill because he didn't know what needed to be corrected not to mention we had to wait the whole meal just to get a refill on waters"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Dave and Buster's. I have been to this location many times and always had a great experience. However, last night was not one of these great experiences. We had a group of 18 that was meeting there for dinner and games to celebrate the birthdays of one of my friends and I. I tried to call ahead and see if we could reserve a table for a specified time and we could not as it is against their policy. The employee that took the call was kind enough to check on wait times with the hostess and I was informed that I should expect a wait time of approximated 30 minutes at my desired arrival time of 4:30 pm. So, I decided to get there a bit early to ensure that the rest of our party would not have to wait to be seated. Upon arrival at 4:15 pm I was told that it would be a 1hour and 45minute wait! I explained that I had called less than two hours earlier and was unable to put in my name for a table but was advised of an approximate wait of 30 minutes. I then asked why, if it is a 1hour and 45minute wait, was I not allowed to put my name in when I called approximately 1hour and 45minutes ago. I also offered the solution of just putting in my name three times for three separate tables of six with the hopes that would at least be near each other. The hostess, whose name I wish I would have gotten (she is slender with blond hair and glasses), proceeded to tell me in a less than friendly moderately condescending tone that they just don't do that and that everyone there had to walk in and wait their turn. She went so far as to start pointing out other tables and telling me their stories. I interrupted her and stated that I was not really concerned with the situations of the other guests. I also let her known that she had a very bad attitude for someone that is working in a service capacity and walked away. She followed after and brought me my buzzer. My husband showed up moments later (he was parking the car and missed the exchange) and within 10 minutes of that our buzzer went off. We made our way back to the hostess stand with my husband leading the way. When he approached the hostess he was friendly, said hello to her, and handed her the buzzer. She was very cold, returned no greeting, and informed us that we were put on the wait list incorrectly and would not actually be seated at that time. I suggested that she just give us three buzzers and put us down on the wait list for three tables of 6, and she did. It was not long before one of our buzzers went off and much to our surprise and delight we were being led to a table that would accommodate our entire party of 18! My husband excitedly thanked the hostess to which she said nothing. I then said, \"you must have a magic wand! Thank you so much!\" To which she said, \"yep\" without an ounce of friendliness but an eye roll and a smirk instead.   There are two reasons that this review is still getting 3 stars:  1) I am basing it on the culmination of experiences that we have had with this location and not just this one isolated incident. 2) Our servers were FANTASTIC! Seriously impressive...I could not thank them enough for the job they did.  I have worked in the service industry in various capacities for 20 years. I have worked as a busser, server, hostess, customer service rep, financial aid advisor, real estate agent, and retail associate. Providing an outstanding and memorable guest/customer experience is something that I love to do and do well. That being said, if I were rating this establishment based on this experience alone it probably would have gotten two stars, due completely to the great wait staff and crazy fun games. Yes, I would remove three stars just for the terrible attitude and interaction of the hostess. She is the first impression and point of contact for the guests. Had I not been a returning customer (I have been a repeat customer of this location for at least 5 years) I probably would have left and taken my party of EIGHTEEN ($$$) elsewhere to celebrate. If this were my first experience I would probably never return here to eat again. Hopefully this woman gains some understanding of her position and job description before she drives away customers that could potentially return and contribute to her paycheck."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your kids/family.   Fun for all safe place, great drinks, pool tables...  and toys.  We really like it."}
{"text":"Edit: I called the store while waiting and talked to another lady, who got a manager for me. He came out got us seated, talked to us and then was our server until our server was able to get to us. He apologized numerous times and came back numerous times to check on us. He made our dining experience extremely pleasant. A million thanks to him!!  Every time we come we have to wait for someone to show up and seat us. Today we waited a few minutes and finally a girl came to ask us how many. She told us the wait would about 15 minutes. We wait 35 minutes and go to the counter to ask again. Then another woman tells us that they actually said 20-30 minutes. She wasn't even there when we made the request. Naturally I'm very upset because she was rude and we've waited all this time. She tells us we are next. We have currently waited 50 minutes for an originally 15 minutes wait time, then turned 20-30 minutes. We would leave but we've already purchased the game cards. Who knows how much longer we will wait to be seated to eat, hopefully sometime today!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my little cousin's birthday for a quick snack/dinner. I have eaten at places that have given me food poisoning for two days and places that have snuck food items I am very allergic to into their larger plates/meals...Dave & Busters food here is, without a shred of a doubt, absolutely terrible and far worse than anything I've had. My grandfather made me eat a liverwurst sandwich plain, I would take that over the spinach dip, pretzel dog, salsa, calamari, and certainly more than the pizza-dilla that Dave &a Busters serves. Do not dine here unless you plan to vomit instead of play/relax/have fun/enjoy your family outing."}
{"text":"First time going to D&B and wow such fun. This place is huge.  We had a large group of 12 on our table so firstly they should have done better on the service rather than assigning one waitress who struggled to keep up with the orders and drinks. Everything got staggered to the point meals and drinks were coming out way too slow.   I had never been here before so was expecting the food to be really crappy but not at all. I had the calmari and half rack ribs and both were good. Not amazing but you know good for a pub/bar.  So when buying food you also get the choice of a combo of food and points on a card which can be used on the arcade machines. I somehow got duped into getting the booster and then the booster booster but i was drunk and would have said yes to anything at that point. I am not sure what the value for money is here but I did get to try loads of the arcade machines and some classics that I had not played in years. The 4 player linked mario kart was exceptionally fun.   Would definitely go here again a bit more sober next time."}
{"text":"Plenty of reviewers have attested to the fun atmosphere, and I agree. It is definitely a fun place. Lots of games, lots of people, big easy bar. Especially fun with a raucous group. And I hadn't played skeeball in years.  But at these prices it kinda sucks when a machine eats your money. Two of ours straight up didn't work. One was a shooting game that acknowledged shots made, but never recorded them. The other was the (expensive) air-hockey table. The puck should be able to float from one end to the other without getting stuck. You go to an arcade like this knowing that they are going to ream you on prices, but to blow money on non-functioning games adds insult to injury.  Still had a good time though."}
{"text":"we decide to have our christmas party here for the enterteiment. i was so desagree the food the plates were expensive and not very good.  also they did let us play on the table pools because the have some kind of activity with few people over."}
{"text":"The only reason they're getting a 2 star is due to their dining area. I have no complaints to the gaming area except that they are a little pricey. However every time I have family in town, they always want to go here. Each time we dined in, the service has been consistently slowwww even when they aren't crowded. The waitress I got the first time was rude and didn't know anything about the menu. When we wanted dessert, I asked if there was anything with cinnamon in it (I have a terrible allergy). She said she would check on it and when she came back she said she wasn't able to find out so \"I just wouldn't do it\" was her reply. The second dining experience was a little better. Still incredibly slow, but the waitress was way nicer although she didn't smile as much."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great . The lady Jillian at the front was the most disrespectful rudest lady ever . Someone should really check on this lady's customer service skills . Also the bar tenders seem to not care about their customers. We will never return to this place solely because of the horrible service    !!!"}
{"text":"this is my playdium for adults; food we had chicken wings, they were okay. The service was slow.  I got annoyed by the people who load your card in the games area- she was more concerned about her text convo than she was answering my questions.   came here after YEARS on Halloween day.  we saw Bobby Motta's show first and then went to play games.  I strongly recommend the show if you have an opportunity to see it, it was great! the Walmart receipt will trip you out."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews! We had a great time. (Four adults and two kids, so a pretty good mix)  The food was good! Bar food is bar food...and we all enjoyed it. The spinach dip is a must try and the double cheeseburger was great (fries were good too). We had some donuts for desert and they were delicious...warm, soft, and crispy on the outside.   Our server JP was amazing and took great care of us the entire time. He was funny, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The games were a lot of fun and really spread out well so it doesn't feel too cramped in there.   Loved all the TV's with different sports playing.  Only con was it was super loud...I expected it to be somewhat loud, but I don't like having to shout at the person sitting next to me at dinner so that they can hear me.  We'll definitely be back for happy hour again soon."}
{"text":"Great place for food and fun.  Food isn't the best, but you get what you pay for.  Games can be expensive if you are spending more than 2 hours here playing non-stop.  On the weekends after 9pm, you have to be at least 21 y/o with a Valid ID to be in it.  They will have people checking ID's at the entrance."}
{"text":"So my daughter wants to have her birthday here.  They won't make reservations, they won't put our cake n the fridge.  Basically there customers service is a Zero in my book n the manager is very unprofessional and I give him a Fail as a grade. Just keeping it real.   Let's see how the rest of the night goes. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Took my kids here to have some fun kids wanted to ride the new ride I paid $15 and was quoted 10 mins my kids ended up waiting 30 mins kids that were in line after us got on the ride before mine! Staff didn't even bother to say anything didn't even tell us we had to wait longer nothing! Poor customer service Such a waste of money!"}
{"text":"First time, but pretty cool place to let loose and act like a kid again.  Plus food is pretty tasty also and arcade games are more aimed towards adults."}
{"text":"It I could give a 0, I would! This is the WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my life. We were overcharged for our billiard game and they refused to do anything about it. I will be in touch with corporate tomorrow. The manager, Shantel Thomas obviously doesn't understand what good customer service is...she was rude and upon listening  to our situation  told us \"you don't work here so you don't know\".  Really? Wow. And the girl at the host stand also had a terrible attitude and looked like garbage (employee nose rings should not be allowed in a dining establishment)."}
{"text":"Over priced, over hyped but a hell of a time regardless.  I think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz.  I've yet to eat something here that impressed me.  The arcade is a bit dated but I like playing the big trivia game more than anything (again, you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit).  The new TV set up is pretty cool, but Dave and Busters is just what it is, an adult Chuckie Cheese not worth more than a visit a year, if that."}
{"text":"Have been here many times. Never really had any issues. This time the food took over a 1/2 hour to come to our table. Manager apologized and offered us 1 desert, which I thought was offensive. Any other place would have offered more."}
{"text":"I come on Wednesday at least once a month and I am so surprised with all the negative review most of the time I have had nothing but a great time maybe once did I have bad service but 90% of my experience has been amazing I come with about six people the Longest I had to wait was five minutes. I love the half price games on Wednesdays I am actually going tonight to celebrate a friends birthday"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I was excited to get a D&B in Vegas, having had countless fun nights out at the Honolulu location while in college and after.  Unfortunately, the experience for my wife and I at the Summerlin location was underwhelming at best. We sat at a booth by the bar to grab a quick bite and drink before going to a movie.  The Food: Decent. Back of the house has it together, but our \"loaded\" tots, which were supposed to be covered in cheese and bacon and sour cream had no sour cream, and cheese and bacon on about 7/50 tots. The tater cakes were ok, but the white dipping sauce was not ranch, as one might expect...it was horseradish sauce! It would've been nice to be told that before putting that stuff on the food :-/ Clearly, the waiter had no idea because when my wife asked for ranch, he said, \"Ok, I'll bring another one.\" The spinach dip was the best of the three items we ordered.  The Drinks: Surprisingly decent prices for a big beer and a Bloody Mary. Now, they just need to teach their wait staff about their drink options. This guy had clearly never heard of a mimosa, and when my wife asked if they could make her one, he said, \"If it's not on one of those [three separate] menus, then we don't have it.\" I saw the beer taps from our seat, two of the handles of which said \"Samuel Adams Seasonal\" and \"Joseph James Seasonal.\" I asked what the seasonals were and was told, \"Our seasonal is Sam Adams.\" After I left our table to ask the bartender, he gave me a sample, and I decided what I wanted. Unfortunately, the waiter ordered the wrong beer, and I had to go reorder from the bartender anyway.  The Service: Bad, with the exception of the bartender, who looked like Tyson Beckford with tattoo sleeves, ladies. Never have I signed a check, had the booklet between my arms as I finish my beer and converse with my guest, and had a waiter try to come back and grab the signed check from under my glass.  I probably won't come back. Maybe if I'm in the area, we'll sit at the bar to check out happy hour.  They have a lot of big screen TVs, so catching football could be cool, but these folks couldn't handle a slow day, so I can't imagine NFL game day.  This place has nothing but room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place has gone down-hill. Extremely rude server that shows his negative attitude 100%... rude, rushed and unfriendly. Food comes out wrong and gross. Microwaved and less than mediocre. No one comes to check on you... I've been a member for over 15 years... sloppy and horrible presentation. Asked to speak to a manager. His name is \"Remi\". This \"thug-like\" jerk who could care less comes out and could give zero f***s. \"What else do you want?\" Without an explanation... all the four of us felt very unwelcome and offended... like WHO MADE YOU A MANAGER and WHY ARE YOU A MANAGER IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS???? Both the server and manager were very mean and rude and obviously hates their jobs with a passion like they'd rather be home rather than \"put up\" with what they are paid to do. I felt very unwelcome and offended. Tonight I feel like I want to cash out all of my 190,000 tickets and never come back here. Ghetto to the max. Dave and Buster's you should be ashamed of who you hire here, your employees are miserable and hate their jobs. It's obvious. Both these guys weren't nice at all and were such super mean careless jerks. Shame on you... never again. I WILL CALL corporate if I don't receive a call or response within 48 hours. This experience has been the most horrible, regrettably said. Server's name is Mario. To both of you guys, if you ever come to my place of employment and ever treated you less than half as badly, I hope I'd get fired so I can go home and reevaluate my life and how I should treat customers from that time moving forward. Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review since December 2012. Our company held a small function (25 - 30 guests) at this location and it was 100% terrific. From the day I called to receive information, secure the event and the day the event took place, they had all their bases covered. The day of the party, there were no slip ups in service - they were working with us throughout the event to ensure all was going well. The food was tasty, the small room we had was decorated appropriately and the servers were the consummate professionals! I highly recommend this as a spot for a couple hours of relaxation and an opportunity to put some fun into your work day/week. Nice work Dave and Buster's!"}
{"text":"Drove an hour and a half to Dave and busters for our very first time to celebrate my daughter's birthday. We were seated at a table and left alone. We sat for over 30 minutes and were never even served drinks. we watched as seven members of the waitstaff stood in a circle to talk. Several waiters /waitresses walked past our table many times. we left and are now going to Texas roadhouse to eat where we are always treated as family. And I'll be sharing this information with all of my friends as well. Totally disappointed and starving!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever been sitting at a dirty table for an hour and not one Waiter has come by yet"}
{"text":"I arrived at 7:04pm and it's currently 7:42pm and I still don't have food. It took the waitress 13 minutes to acknowledge me with what are you drinking?  No menu no nothing. Dave and busters has a million specialty drinks you don't think I should get to look at the menu?  I had to request a menu. I finally got to order my food and pointed to it on the menu to make sure she knew what I was asking for and she still put in the wrong food. He manager then brings out steak and potatoes and I told him the food was not mine he said it was with a slight 'tude. I then showed him from the menu what I ordered and he said he's put it in and make sure it came out next...by the time I finished writing this review I am still without food. Update: the manager came out with the correct entreé. The entree was the steak and shrimp pasta with lobster cream sauce (sounds great right) the steak was cooked well done. I asked for medium.  The manager came back and asked how it looked. I informed him that the steak was over cooked his reply\" I ALREADY COMPED HALF YOUR FOOD!\"   I'm not looking for a comp I'm looking for the right order. At that point I cut my losses and went to TGIFRIDAYS Wayyyy better service!"}
{"text":"I find it interesting that I was asked for my i.d. a few min after walking in and paying for my gaming. I am 25... it was mid day I am not at a bar drinking so to just check my i.d. and not tell me why gave me a bad vibe. Maybe ask for my i.d. and tell me this is to make sure I am above 18.. but thanks for telling my husband and I that we look so young."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I was really hesitant to come to this location after reading many of the negative reviews, but my husband and I decided to check it out for the half-priced games on Wednesday.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience!  We arrived at 430 in the afternoon and decided to eat before game play. Almost immediately after sitting at the bar, we were greeted by Sandra.  She was very friendly, personable and attentive.  The food was ON POINT.  We ordered the crispy steak 'n tater cakes for an appetizer (OMG YUM). My husband ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp with lobster sauce and fire-grilled sirloin - he would not shut up about how amazing it was and ate every last bite, I'm surprised he didn't lick the damn plate. I ordered the ultimate Mac 'n cheese, and it's that and more. Best Mac n cheese, the crispy bacon and chicken made the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth pasta to die for. My only complaint about the meal experience was that our appetizer came out with our entrée, no time to first enjoy that beforehand...but hey, it was all perfect and we had full happy tummies. Sandra was sure to apply a military discount to our meal which was awesome and very appreciated.   Game play was a blast, good mix of new and classic games. I had read a review that mentioned dirty and/or broken games...? Where? Nothing appeared to be \"dirty\" and my husband and I did not come across one \"out of order \" game that we wanted to play.  We both love video games and were definitely not disappointed. Also, bathrooms were neat and clean.  We will absolutely be back soon for another half price Wednesday, highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a night of fun, Dave & Buster's is definitely the place to go! Food, games, and great times all around! The servers are super nice, and they make sure to come back around to check on you and make sure you're doing good. The front desk girls are always smiling as they give you your card to go play the games. Employees, like JD and Debra, who were holding the front door open, welcoming in each and every customer is the bonus added touch. They are so nice and courteous to their customers, by making sure they leave DB with a smile on their face and a good time!"}
{"text":"The place is loud and obnoxious but that's what you are paying for. Our server was cool, but the fries were cold. Drinks were cold ..... hey I see a theme! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nachos were delicious, kids absolutely loved the games, and compared to some of the other places I have been lately the price wasn't bad.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's good to know that this place is terrible no matter which state you are in. We are visiting from Las Vegas and staying nearby. With the Las Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup finals, what a better place to watch the game... or so we thought.   First, it's a great place for families. The games are fun and the kids have a good time. Unfortunately the food is only one level above chuck-e-cheese (but for adults). Drinks are expensive and are often poured short. Your best bet is to order beer; hard to mess that up.   I think what disappoints me the most is the service. Listen, I'm all for giving young adults a chance to earn a decent living, but the kids here are lazy. Most stand around and only help when you ask.  We watched the entire game here and ordered food towards the end of the first period. It was okay... But the table was left in-bussed for a good 40 minutes after completing our meals and drinks. A guy came by the host stand with a buss cart and left it there... So I took it upon myself to buss our table. Not one server offered to help as they stood silently and watched. Unbelievable!  Then, sitting at an empty table for the remainder of the third period, no one came buy to see how we were doing. We would have gladly ordered more overpriced drinks, but instead when the game was over, we asked for our check and took our business elsewhere.  The only plus was the one person who was able to get the game on for us... Thanks"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  The place is like Chuck E Cheese for adults,  which is not a bad thing. But when you have a bartender that is lazy and not attentive,  then you have a recipe for disaster. Ordered the Lotsa Loaded Tots... Crispy potato tots loaded with hot queso,  crispy bacon,  and green onions.  Well the cheese was cold.  The tots were scarse and the bacon was flaccid. Like I said Chuck E Cheese for adults.  Poor service,  terrible food and expensive games.  On the plus side,  they have a  lot of TVs; too bad you can't hear over the constant drone of noise."}
{"text":"Did not eat any of their food so I cannot comment on that. However, the restrooms were deplorable, and there are no sanitation stations where you can sanitize your hands after touching numerous machines. There should be sanitation stations throughout the business so you can get the germs off your hands from millions of people playing the games. Bathroom should be clean and worthy of the customer."}
{"text":"Waited a while and the server my gf and I were supposed to have didn't notice us, but a nice server came by and helped us out.  Food was good, I got pretzel dogs and one didn't have a hot dog in it haha, but it was still good.  This place just needs to work on customer service."}
{"text":"3 of us went to watch the ufc fights last night at 7pm, but arrived early to secure a spot. UNC vs Duke were playing on espn, but 0 tv had this game on. I tried reaching out to three different employees in 90 min span, one of those employees was the manager. During our time at the bar the tv was never changed to our request. I understand it's a busy night, but being a so called sports bar I feel this easy request should have been taken care of. Bartenders were great, and helpful."}
{"text":"Our group of friends usually heads to Tempe Mktplace due to it being a 'central' location for all of us that are at all extremes of the valley.... we've done D&B several times now and, though it's been enjoyable (it's always fun with good friends) with drinks and games, I find that it is a waste of $ and their food isn't even worth going in for dinner.  We've dropped lots of cash on the D&B cards.. we've drank and played... (I usually know where to play for the high ticket jackpots)... earned some tickets.. then, at the end of the night when we have combined all our tickets (apparently not really all that much), we find ourselves looking sadly at the *crap* they have in their little store and deciding we should just give away the tickets to any kiddos nearby and walk out while we still are in an up-beat mood.  Food is lame (better options nearby), service is standard, atmosphere is fun and so are the games.. but be prepared to spend a pretty penny for the game entertainment."}
{"text":"My son loved it here ! But the pay off to get tickets are hard and you gotta spend over a hundred bucks or more to win a decent prize , he came home with a dinky toy, besides that we had a fun time running around ."}
{"text":"My 3 star review isn't changing but i did want to mention our most recent visit. Came to dinner here with a family of 7 total. Our server Carmen did mention before she sat us that they are shorthanded while also tending to a party room of 30 ppl. However, our server was very timely still being able to check on us and fill waters, remove plates. It was the kitchen that took forever with our meal. Me and my brother each ordered the unlimited wings, which btw you are not allowed to share with your party. Me and my brother weren't  even allowed to share and we ordered the same thing! Which is why i had to order my own.. i understand there are rules & thats how its run. Corporate happened to be there that night & even delivered one of our wings to us. While doing so he was staring down at our table, not even engaging with us. Just staring! Im assuming he was looking to see if we were sharing.. we sat right next to the kitchen so every time he would pass by... just looking at our plates. We felt uncomfortable & stared down... check pls! Although, our server Carmen was professional, friendly and provided the most excellent service... request her, she'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a double date with some friends here on a Saturday night! Prior to coming, I checked the NoWait app and it said a 23-40 minute wait. However, my friend got there first and said there was no wait at all. Not sure what happened there. I had the Thai Chicken Chopped Salad. It wasn't my favorite meal and after eating it, I immediately wished I had a burger instead. It wasn't very filling. After we played some games. It was extremely busy, given it was a Saturday night but we didn't have any problems playing the games that we wanted. It was definitely a fun evening with friends and we will be going back to add to our ticket collection!"}
{"text":"What a HORRIBLE place I ordered an appetizer it was 16 dollars and came with 4 slider burgers and 4 wings! It was essentially 2 dollars per item! The menu did not specify how many it came with. Needless to say I'll never order food there again."}
{"text":"Service was great I would give that a 6 stars. The service is great. But I give them a 3 for not being busy and my fries coming out cold that is a deal breaker. I would come agin."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant.... Service could be better.  Prices could be better.  Good for all ages!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude blonde girl at the game center was mean to my two little girls and more interested in flirting with the  male customers . When my husband requested the manager she was equally as rude! I will be contacting corporate in the morning!"}
{"text":"The place is cool and everything but the wait line is ridiculous for a table... 2 hours!! So if you eat dinner at 7 make sure you're here at least be 5... this is a bigger Chuck E Cheese with a bar"}
{"text":"Went in and sat down for some food it wasn't busy at all in the dining area maybe 4 tables including us and 2 of them were getting ready to leave. It took 6-7 minutes before anyone came over to our table to introduce there self and take drink orders. Upon coming back we said we needed another minute to look at the menu, nothing looked that appealing so we went ahead and said we don't want food but we do want a game card and the check for the two sprites in which our server walked past us maybe 5 times before we got fed up and went to the front counter to get our game card ourselfes in which he hurry up and gives us the bill without the card still  The two sprites were 6.00$ complete rip off, guy was a complete idiot... On the other side the game room was cool and the battle pod was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for quite a well, and I've always been a fan. Upon entering the restaurant at 6pm on a Friday, our IDs were checked. You have to have at least one person who is 21+ to be seated---this is odd but okay. While we're looking at the menu, a man shows up out of nowhere with a camera asking to take our picture for a keychain--it's free but he's \"working for tips\". Other than these two odd happenings, the meal was great. I ordered the Fire-Grilled Salmon and it's one of the best salmon dinners I've ever had. I'll definitely return again for games and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is such a joke. They advertise themselves to basically be an adult version of Chuch E Cheese. THERE WERE KIDS RUNNING AROUND WILD EVERYWHERE! On top of that the food prices are outrageous and not even that great. Complete waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Soooooo fun.... Made me feel like a kid again. All the games are brand new. Great prizes for the ticket games. Good size bar for drinks and bar food. The pricea to play are reasonable. I would definetly bring my friends and family here once a month."}
{"text":"We planned our son's birthday party here on Friday at 5pm. Alex from events and our servers Eddie (and we forgot the girl's name) were amazing the entire time.  The food was okay, but I think all D&B food is the same quality.  But we were happy and satisfied and the leftovers were eaten today. It looked very busy as we were leaving, so if you don't want to wait long or whatever come early. Thanks to Cricket and Alex again for organizing the party. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers that I have had. I had the Philly cheesesteak burger which was juicy and delicious! I wanted a side salad with it but would have been charged $2.50 extra - so I opted not to go for a healthy side.   The waitress and the manager were extremely nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to the Dave & Buster's in Orange, CA but this place is great too! My boyfriend and I had tons of fun with all the games, Space Invader was our favorite! It can get a little crowded, and watch for little kids and toddlers running around.  My cousin had a pizza pretzel, and it was really good! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just wanted to come here to play games and have fun but no - they wouldn't let us 18 year olds in just to play games because we're under 21. We needed a guardian 25 and older. Only Dave and Busters that I know that does this. I am disappointed, it's not like we were going to drink at the bar or even sit down there. The rules are too unreasonable. Do not come here."}
{"text":"At Dave & busters for mothers day.  The tables are filthy and sticky, the floors are slimy and we have a waitress that refuses to smile or show any personality.   She is obviously new and they keep seating her section and she can't handle what she has.  Hoping the food is better than we have experienced so far!"}
{"text":"The NRA is laughing at me right now. Bears and squirrels love me. Thank you D&B for confirming that I should never go hunting or shoot guns. If the hunting video game could have given me a negative score, I probably would have gotten it.  We just had to check it out while we waited for a free concert to begin, even if my dexterity and video game skillz aren't quite what they were back in 1989 and even if we had to endure multiple nerd alerts.  This place is predictable.  Great concept, weak execution.  Average food, small weak cocktails and as others have said before tons of video games, skeeball and the like. The Thursday night scene consisted of ASU students, young suburban couples and packs of 20-something dudes, and thankfully no kids in sight.   The rechargeable card thing isn't exactly intuitive. I ended up getting charged a few more times than I should have.  Doh.  I'll probably come back when my 19 year old brother is in town, but for now I'll stick with house get-togethers for video games."}
{"text":"Gameworks is better.  This place is nothing special. Haven't really bothered with the food and the games are decent. Their selection is small compared to Gameworks and RoundOne in Cali but they're more expensive and their rewards are cheaper.  What ticks me off most is the shit atmosphere the staff provides. Look, I get it, it's work but most of the staff are hard pressed for a smile. There's no friendly atmosphere. The cops with crossed arms by the doors doesn't help. Bring your ID because apparently they card you after 10pm even for the game area. After you talk to some of their bitchy staff, yeah I'll be happy to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Dave and Busters today our experience was horrible the food was cold and my daughters cheeseburger was raw they had make the cheeseburger five different times to get it correct not only was my daughters cheeseburger raw so  was my husband's then the game cards did not work after leaving Dave and busters Amirapark valet service Lost my mother-in-law's car key we had to sit there for three hours waiting to get a key made for her. My families experience in Concorde today was absolutely horrible and we will not return again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available.  In regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at."}
{"text":"I've been to Dave & Busters a couple of times now, and it's a fun kid friendly place with a nice bar. They also have a separate dining area as well. The games are fun, but can get pretty pricey. I really didn't care for the games that much, but it's great for bringing the whole family. The bar area is nice and wide open with huge screens everywhere. I've noticed that on the other reviews, people have been critical of the food. I actually thought the food was pretty good. I ended up getting the ribs and wings combo, and the portions were pretty generous. The ribs were tender, and the wings were decent in size. I kind of wish they would have setup the bar area with pool tables and dart boards so it gives you another option besides the games. All in all, Dave & Busters is a fun place to bring kids, but also a cool place to have a drink and catch a game."}
{"text":"Place is geared for ankle-biters but can be really fun if you had 5 or more mixed drinks. Shooting zombies,  racing cars, shooting soldiers, shooting monsters, all that fun arcade stuff. And you also get tickets to win overstuffed animals or just put it back as credit to your Dave and Buster's card. There's a cool bar  up on the 2nd floor that overlooks the mall if you get tired of all the arcade mayhem. Probably worth a couple of hours of solid fun or until a member of your group gets booted from the premises for trying to smoke  in the bathroom. Whichever comes first..."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a drink while 4 bartenders argued right in front of us. Plates were dirty. Highlight was slightly below average boneless wings."}
{"text":"We visited here with family that lives in the area.   Coming from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, home of the original D & B's, I have to ask: W. T. F. ?!  Any establishment with arcade games is going to be a little on the noisy side, but this was truly sensory overload from the time you walked in.   Right inside the front doors is an appealing, but overpowering perfume-like scent.  I wasn't sure if it was a classy air freshener or a hostess bathed in perfume before her shift, but whatever it was, it was too much.  There were lights flashing everywhere, music blaring.   It was like being at a rave, but the only mushrooms were of the portabella variety.  Basically, it's as if D & B's is realizing their target demographic has shifted and now consists of adults who were raised having parties with talking rats and crappy pizza and stinky ball pits.   They need more sensory stimulation.  I get it.     The food was overpriced but decent.   I had the roasted veggie sandwich and it was a little greasy, but good.     The kids enjoyed the play area and I enjoyed schooling them at skee ball, so all was not lost.   They were a little disappointed that their game room \"earnings\" netted exactly one sticky hand and a small package of gummy bears.   Life is hard, kids."}
{"text":"Very expensive for terrible food and terrible service. Have gone a few times. Food has always been bad. Last time I went, literally every table around ours was asking to see the manager about their meals."}
{"text":"What to say? They're all the same.  Crazy kids running around like they snorted pixy dust but having time of their lives.  I will say from a parents point of view the full bar option is always welcomed.  I'm amazed at some of the video games that have come out.  Pretty cool stuff.  They have bowling downstairs which is a bonus as well.    I ordered the BBQ Wing Sliders and they were great.  So based on that I'd give a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"One of the worse experiences in my life.  Total miscommunication on the hostess.  We were told it was a 45/60 wait time, but come back in 30 minutes.  Our buzzer never buzzed and we never heard our name on the intercom so they called us a \"no show\", but we were in the dining/arcade area the entire time.  We tried to see if they could accommodate us, but the hostess said you have to put your name back on the bottom of the list and wait another 45 minutes.  What a waste of time and money.  The food is pricey for the quality of the food.  This doesn't even come close to the D&B in Hawaii.  No \"Aloha\" spirit in Vegas!  Moreover, the hostess needs a class in customer service.  #gameworksgreaterthanDandB"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest. I came in on a Wednesday to recharge my card, politely, and redeem my free $10 play because I received and email. But the lady gave me an attitude and said \"nope.\" And proceeded to tell me that on Wednesdays every game cost half the chips. On the email it said nothing about not redeeming the coupon on Wednesday's. The place would be much better if the workers aren't rude."}
{"text":"I only played in the arcade today because i was not leaving without getting the giant gorilla lol I finally got enough tickets to bring him home tonight so i was really happy"}
{"text":"This is just a review of the Salsa dancing on Wednesday nights on the roof. It's free for ladies, $10 for men. Was pretty hot outside (over 100) when we started at 7, but they did have fans around and misters. The dance instructor Brenda was a hoot haha! She doesn't mess around. There were WAY more men than women. Drinks were mighty expensive and nothing of value was on tap. Would recommend for a cheap date night or if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"Love this Dave and Busters. Not as many games as the one at Tempe Marketplace, but they have bowling and a better shuffleboard/billiards room. Plus, Desert Ridge is much nice and has more food options than Tempe Marketplace.  Bowling is nice, not too overpriced (per hour only). Good atmosphere, lower lighting, much better than most bowling alleys. In between a Lucky Strike and and AMF.   Drink specials are so-so, service at the upstairs bar is usually good. Food is typical bar fare, with smallish portions, not great, not bad. I usually hit happy hour at Yardhouse for a vastly superior menu and better value before or after D&B.  The facility in general isn't as nice as the newer one's, but it's not old and funky, and everything is usually clean and the games all work.   Sucks that D&B got rid of Gold pricing on their games, so there's no real reason to keep my 9 year old Powercard anymore. Spent too damn much to get Gold! Game prices keep going up sadly."}
{"text":"Food was ok but came here for lunch and took forever! Our server disappeared, never brought the desert and we had to reach out to another server to bring the bill. They left us no time to play. TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I was never really a fan of D&B's, until receiving the service I got from the Downtown Summerlin location.   I wish I could've remembered the server's name, and give her praise for the more than adequate job last night. She was super attentive and always made sure our beverages were refilled---she was just overall an awesome waitress.  My party and I decided to just get some appetizers, and ended up with the Loaded Tater Tots and the Calamari; both were pretty good, but the tater tots were definitely the winner.   Beers and cocktails, of course, were taxed up the butthole and my vodka and Red Bull and my boyfriend's Henny and Coke cost us $25. Thats the only reason why I am giving this establishment a 4/5, as much as I like drinking out, I still can't justify the prices of drinks. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"The burger was greasy and tasted as though it had been frozen for about a year.  You can't say much about the atmosphere of a place that is screaming for your attention.  I came with a group of visitors from Shanghai, and they loved it, though, so maybe it just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"So we came in on a Friday. The place was packed wall-to-wall! Got set up with a game card. Cool. I like that machines don't issue paper tickets anymore (go environmental awareness!). Grabbed a bite at the bar and like others have said, the service is a little slow at the bar. But the bar was packed and only 3 people serving. They weren't slow due to lack of action. I ordered the lettuce wraps and they were delicious! Best ever!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst arcade in the franchise.  I have been in Philly - on the river, and two in California.  The arcades were dramatic, with many driving games, golf, baseball, and a couple of multi-user \"star wars\" shoot-em-up scenarios.  The billiard pit had over a dozen tables in the pit, and the restaurant was overlooking the pit.  My wife and I went to the new one in Glendale today.  The games were your basic video style games...loud and bright,  but not very creative.  When I got home, I looked at the menu again.  The food we got was nowhere like the pictures.  We split the sandwiches  1.  Nachos:  No jalapenos, no beef.  In addition, I asked for the beans, guacamole, and sour cream to be on the side.  Nope, right in the nachos.  2.  Philly Cheesesteak:  Not even close to the picture.  Anemic amounts of steak.  I might have been able to judge the flavor if I could taste it.  This dish was supposed to come with seasoned fries.  NOPE!  Just highly salted regular fries.  3.  Make's Mark Bourbon BBQ:  The burger matches the picture, the BBQ was not even close.  What's worse, I couldn't even taste it - it was overpowered by the burger.  Also, NO seasoned fries.  I had a Guinness...nice and cold.  It's hard to mess that up.  My wife had one of the margarita drinks.  She could almost taste the tequila.  All this came to $58.00.  For $58.00, I expect good food, made the way the menu says it is to be made.  This D & B is no longer on my visitation list."}
{"text":"Omg. The worst experience ever (for food). I take my 5 year old nephew there for some fun and food and it was just an overall nightmare. The waitressing staff is horrible. Everyone looks like they hate their job and that's the behavior also. Our waitress barely checked on our table in comparison to the other tables with their servers. The appetizers finally come and what do I see: the bacon crumbles on my lettuce wraps I specifically asked to be not added. So now I've got to wait longer. My meal comes out before my appetizer now and even that is cold. My sliders, wings, and my nephews breaded hot dogs were ALL cold. One of the managers comes around and asks how the service and food was I tell him the truth (only about the food. I didn't want the waitress in trouble). He says he'll go back to the kitchen to get me warm items and NEVER returns. Like at all the ENTIRE NIGHT. Poorly run. It's only getting TWO stars bc of the awesome service provided in the gaming area where you cash out on prizes. Will not be returning. Ever. Smh."}
{"text":"Service was slow because of the crowd there to see the fight. Food was served lukewarm and it was difficult to get condiments or even napkins. Will have to give them another chance the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love playing the games and the facility is ok. Bar staff was horrible. Ordered the bar and wing combo, everything arrived cold. The bartender gave my companion and I an attitude about reordering. Not sure I will be back. Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would.  Came in after the Gold Cup game and was ignored by a bartender named Sandra while she laughed and joked with friends.  Very unprofessional and unacceptable. Probably will not be coming back after tonight."}
{"text":"We sat down upstairs in one of the booths by the bar area. We literally waited 15 minutes before my husband decided to hunt down the bartender and let him now we were there. The bartender said he'd said someone right away so we waited..  10 minutes later and we're still waiting... My husband then went to hunt a waiter down and found out that they were just standing around talking. She then walks over and apologizes and takes our orders. We get food rather quickly and she barely comes around to ask if we're doing okay. Service was crappy and the only reason we stayed and spent our money there was because I work in the district and everything else was closed. I'm never coming to this location ever again. I rather drive to the Tempe Marketplace one anytime."}
{"text":"We had our daughter's graduation party here last night.  We had a party package which included power cards for all guests, a private room, four hours of bowling, buffet of nachos, pizza, chicken, salad, and fountain drinks.  It did not look like enough food for 23 people, but we had a lot leftover.  Food was good quality and stayed warm throughout the evening in the chafing dishes. The manager and server, David, did an excellent job making sure our room was ready and we had the items we needed for a successful party.  Even though we did not have the lanes rented till 6pm, the manager allowed us to start bowling a little earlier since lanes were available.  David checked in on us many times over the night after we ran out of drinks, for more silverware & plates for the cake we brought.  David also packed up all of the leftover food for us.  My only suggestion is that I wish I had upgraded to $20 power cards. I felt like $10 was too little for our guests who got tired of bowling and wanted games. Otherwise, I'd plan the event exactly the same next time."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Washington state and went here to watch a Seahawks game. My sister in law who lives in town recommended it. I guess they just walked into the bar area and sat in a big table with a great view of the big screen. This apparently really pissed off the bartender who proceeded to ignore our group and give us dirty looks all day. I guess they said those tables were reserved and even asked when we were going to leave a one point. Even though we sat there from 2-5 pm. Those tables weren't reserved until 8pm. They left the whole darn best seat section empty all day and kept sitting everyone in the shitty lower level tables. Bunch of dicks for no reason. Since there was a home Cardinals game actually taking place in town the place was empty all day. Bunch of dicks for no reason. Power trippin.   I can't believe you would take your kid here. Finally made my way upstairs to play some games after sitting around drinking all day. There is a huge bar in the middle of the game floor. What? Why? Is this a kids place or a drinking place. Weird to me its even legal. AZ must have changed some drinking laws. When I was 18 (in AZ) I couldn't even go the bar to see my friends band play. Even when we could we had to stand behind some chain link fence to separate us. Now you can get shitfaced while hundreds of five to ten year old's run around you in circles unsupervised. WTF????? So weird. One reviewer commented on the avoiding games with guns, which I get, my sister is the same way with her kid. What I don't get is why you don't have a problem with THE GIANT BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF A KIDS PLAY ROOM??????  Games are a super rip off. Totally agree it is rigged."}
{"text":"My 2nd time ever at Dave and Busters and this time around I've never felt so rushed, judged and mis-informed at any place I've ever been to. Hostesses gave us 20-30 min wait, ended up waiting over 2+ hours after constantly going up to the host stand getting updates on when we would be seated. Once sat, our server was really nice but when she tried to give back our ID's for the alcohol she specifically said, \"I don't know which one is which, all of you look the same\" and the ID's she took were a mixture of men and women. Not only that but to top it off we still had full glasses of beer on the table and one of the workers (assuming he was the manager) told us, \"I know you guys are having a good time but unfortunately we're closed and you have to leave\" at that point we just digested our food and trying to relax and converse with one another and it was a little after midnight. That's not how you treat your customers Dave and Busters, please re-evaluate on how customer service is really handled."}
{"text":"Only giving it a 1 because I can't give less. We had THE worst experience we've ever had out at a restaurant last Saturday evening (12/30/17). We were told it would be 40 minutes for a table, no problem! Busy Saturday night on a holiday week, we thought 40 min was great. About 45 minutes later we were buzzed to our table in the bar area (high top) however I had told the hostess we needed a high chair. She brought a low high chair so essentially my baby would be under the table??? With an eye roll I asked my husband to grab a tall high chair, which he did. 3 adults and 1 baby sat at our table for 32 minutes before a server walked by and said \"you need something?\" We were extremely turned off by the experience so far, however we were starving so we ordered a the \"5s all around\" appetizer, 2 Miller lites and a water. This is where things got fun. 28 minutes later we stopped the first manager we saw to say we needed help. He apologized and said he'd get our drinks right away. 9 minutes later we got our beers. No water. Then the server came back and asked if we wanted to order entrees. We said no, we just wanted our appetizer for now and she said and I quote \"oh you wanted the 5s? We're out of that. Want something else?\" We we're irate. My friend asked why we were just being told they were out of the app? She said \"I don't know, you want entrees?\" We again called the manager over. He again apologized and said the kitchen just ran out of everything??? Over an hour after sitting down. We explained that all 3 of us work in the restaurant industry and this was completely unacceptable. Not being greeting, not getting drinks, not even being told we weren't getting the appetizer we ordered long ago?! We can completely understand busy. We can completely understand running out of items on a busy night. We cannot understand the non existent service, terrible management and the kicker..: 12 minutes later the manager comes over with the bill for our 2 Miller lites and says sorry. He didn't even comp 2 simple beers! Ha! Never did get that water........ awful."}
{"text":"So right from the start, this place is way too loud!  There was a line at the front cashier so i decided to use the kiosk to buy a game card.  I chose the 170 credits for $29.  Swiped my credit card, and got an error message because the card wouldn't dispense, and told me to see the cashier.  So i assumed my card was charged, but the card got stuck.  Had to sit and wait for the manager to verify, but he gave me a discount card for next time.  The food is way overpriced so we didn't want to eat, just get some drinks, had no idea how to do that, so i asked and was told to just ask the bartender, even if its just a coke.  Very very hard to get the bartenders attention, and couldn't hear the price, so i handed him a ten for two cokes.  Got two bucks back!!  Wow, but they are free refills, so whatever.  Games are fun, prizes are good, but i wouldnt eat there, and just way too loud!!  Is it a club?? Idk if id make the trip to go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Perfect for watching football or ufc. I go early to play games before then use my tickets to get an app to eat during the game. Very big so you never have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"The food is very good and Albert the bartender is the best!! The games and atmosphere is very condusev to family fun"}
{"text":"The food is not good at all, The game atmosphere is pretty cool, but the customer service is horrible I mean absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"I used to have a fun time here but it seems to get harder to get in. I just want to go have a date here and play pool. It used to be one of you gives your ID to the front desk they keep it along with your credit card while you play. Then they ask for a 20$ deposit the next time I went. And now they want all of that plus both IDs....even if I was a minor which I am not, the place clearly says that any minor needs to be accompanied by an adult. Why would you need more than one persons ID, when neither persons are orders food or drinks? So disappointed. Went here 6 times only got to play the first two times. This is ridiculous. Rather drive to pladium."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited for this place to open because I enjoy the D&B in California but boyyyyy was I disappointed. Their customer service is terrible and I don't think they care about customers' requests such as altering a machine to better the performance and the safety of other players. My friends and I often frequent arcades and there's only one other place in Vegas that is comparable and their customer service is SO much better than D&B's.   It's a shame since it was their grand opening and the managements couldn't care less about their customers. I probably won't be returning here until they improve on numerous things."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience at a restaurant in a long time. We have kids and they aren't very accommodating. We got there around noon and were seated at an open booth with 2 stools on the other side. Normally not a problem but the hostess then proceeds to seat everyone else right next to us. Mind you the place is practically empty. I asked her if she could either move us or the other people to give out kids more room from not bothering people but she said she can't because there's not enough servers. The steak was crappy. Onion rings were horrible. Drinks were super expensive. Arcade was nice but expensive. Would not recommend going here. Not going to go back."}
{"text":"Walked in late lunch time with a small coffee and was stopped dead in the foyer with \"I'm sorry you can't bring that in here\". No \"welcome\", \"hello\", or any other reasonable greeting. I asked if I could step in to the establishment and finish my coffee just inside and was denied. Don't feed me the BS line about the city says this or that, I've walked in to countless restaurants with coffee in the past 15 years in Madison and never had that happen.  This was the rudest welcome I've ever had at a restaurant here.  I had my son with me so to not disappoint him we played games for a bit but went elsewhere for lunch. Didn't feel welcome here at all and we won't be back. Good luck being jerks to your customers D&Bs."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Dave & Busters after seeing their TV ads for years. We were even more excited after viewing their menu online. Unfortunately our service was very slow. Tables seated after us received their food before us. My daughter's chocolate milkshake took 15 minutes to arrive and our appetizer arrived with our entrees (this really gets me) after 35 minutes.   Also we were never offered any drink refills. Our server was pleasant, just not attentive. Never communicated any delays except to tell us they had to go get some ice cream for the shake.   Our family had fun playing games after dinner though. The 4 way air hockey was a blast. We'll go back for the games, but probably not for the restaurant. By the way, this was at 4 pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was not busy."}
{"text":"Great place to play games and have fun!  Terrible place to eat.  I think I would rather go here and play games, then take a break to go outside to my car and eat packed peanut butter jelly sandwiches instead of dine here.  First off the Margherita was $10 and not anything special.  I ordered unlimited wings and they would only bring out 5 at a time.  Being a man, I would eat them in about 5 minutes, then it would take another 20 minutes for them to bring out 5 more....  Sometimes they came out cold and old, sometimes nice and hot.  To top it all off though, my girlfriend got food poisoning from here on our anniversary night.  Terrible ending to our anniversary sadly."}
{"text":"Not the server' fault at all.. but the service was not up to par. They seem to be short waiters/waitress' the food was gross and cold. This place has such potential but is extremely poorly managed."}
{"text":"Always a good time here! Wednesdays are awesome for half priced games and a bite to eat. Great range of games from new to classic arcade."}
{"text":"I always feel like a big kid running around D&B but at the same time it's like sensory overload for me. I guess I'm just getting old. My kids absolutely love it here. What's not to like when you're in elementary? This location is not as big as other D&B's that I'm used to but because of this, it's much easier to chase after your kids here lol.   Lots of nostalgic games from my childhood and new games as well. User friendly kiosks to load money onto cards, which I like. No tickets to carry around either. Every point you earn is stored in your card and then redeemed for a prize. Which btw, aren't half bad. Way better than CEC or John's anyway.   I especially liked the sports bar. TVs galore and your typical American pub fare and drinks. Servers are very friendly too. That always makes a difference."}
{"text":"Birthday party for my son and a bunch of his buddies. The boys really enjoyed the arcade games and all of them said that the food was great. Our waitress Jessie was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Went bowling with a few friends. Took 32 minutes to get a drink and had to ask to get service. Almost 40 minutes before our drinks came and we ended up leaving just before the hour was over. Would have drank and ate more but frustrating on the wait. Wasn't too busy either. Ended up leaving and going to have drinks somewhere else.  Bowling was good however the bumpers stopped working after a few throws, appears to be stuck.  No sense of urgency or service."}
{"text":"first time at a Dave and Busters. Food was good waiter was good. Price was reasonable portions were just right."}
{"text":"One of the longest waits I have ever had at any restaurant.  A simple order took over an hour.  And the management didn't seem to care at all.  If they knew it was going to take this they should have never sat us down."}
{"text":"This D&B is starting to show its age, but I still enjoy coming here.  I love playing a few games, drinking some beer, watching whatever sports game is on and then seeing a movie at the AMC theater next door.  It's my favorite way to spend a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"We ordered an all you can eat chicken wings and the waiter did not explain it was an individual meal.. We simply did not know and we were sharing the food..  The manager came out and very rudely said \"is this an all you can eat order because you are not getting anymore\".. He treated us like we were trying to rip off the company.. Ask plenty of questions when ordering your food..  Or better yet.. Eat somewhere else..  Food is not that good and very overpriced anyways.. We spent $32 for six wings and fries to be treated like garbage"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service I've ever experienced in the city of Pittsburgh. I attended a going away gathering for a party of about 10 people. We were seated and given a server within a few minutes. We ordered drinks which took about 15mins then we ordered food, our food took about 30 mins or so... however, some of my friends did not receive their meals or only receive half (a burger with no fries) and when we received our food it was cold, also we ordered a second round of drinks and some of the drinks were forgotten. When we requested to see a manager he did not come over to talk with us, he took money off the bill but did not come over to apologize or anything. The next manager we found was very rude, he did not acknowledge the terrible service we received, he added $5 play cards as a bonus... however, the games were down by the time we were done eating so we couldn't use them. I will never come back to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go and have some fun. Great place for kids during the day and Adults at night. Great place to rent out for events. Fully Stocked bar , they make a great Orange Mojito."}
{"text":"The food is not edible. Ordered a chicken sandwich smothered in barbecue sauce. Chicken was rock hard had to return it. 3 of 5 meals were returned.  For what they charge you can eat at a better place.   Brutally noisy be warned !  Will never come back"}
{"text":"Our first time experiencing D&B. We arrived, the hostesses sat behind the desk felt it was an inconvenience to look or talk to us, they said to go sit. We picked a spot, which all the tables were dirty so we went with the one with the least amount of mess...quickly told to move, twice because we couldn't sit there....   The place was not busy at all.   We asked the waitress how the dine and play worked, she we went on and on about how excited she was as it was our first time but was very vague on how the system worked, after more confusion we just ordered food and gave up on the idea of playing games. We did ask if the TV could move changed to the hockey game and someone said we will ask, never changed.  Our appetizer came it was tossed on our table and the person walked away, we had no plates, napkins or silverware. We had to find our own. When our dinner arrived this was also dropped on the table and we were ignored, waitress passed by \"everything ok?\", but not stopping so she did not have time to hear our response. I ordered my burger medium well, it came...raw. My husband ordered his burger medium well, it was well done. No water, no refills of drinks...We were given our check as a pass by."}
{"text":"It's the chuck e cheese for adults. I like going here when there are kids playing ticket games and they(and/or the parents) fail to hit the jackpot.  That's where I come in to hit the jackpot they've help accumulate.    Their food is decent. You can't go wrong with the blackened chicken pasta. I do miss their tempura mushrooms and rib-eye steak entrees.  Great place to watch sports. They have two large projectors along the bar and flat screens against the walls. It's a great place to grab a quick bite, a few drinks, watch some sports, and play games. At least the ticket redemption area has prizes worth saving tickets. You're paying for the entertainment at the same time trying to win prizes, though it would be easier to just go to some electronics store and buy prize you see in the glass case.  I came back after locating my California D&B card number to roam in Phoenix so I could redeem a big prize with my tickets, but the staff weren't able to do it.  I was told they would be able to do it with just my account number."}
{"text":"I had never been to D & B before and took my teenage daughter and her friends. The place is huge. There's a sports bar, dining area and arcade with dining seating as well.   We were sat in a horseshoe shaped booth that sat 5 very comfortably. Pretty large menu. Prices fair. We ordered the Bass Ale fish & chips, the Philly cheese steak with fries, Chicken Quesadilla & that sliders with wings platter. To start off we had the spinach dip & some potatoes skins. There wasn't a very long wait for the food to arrive and everyone enjoyed their meal. The bill came to $100 which is pretty good. I will mention that we all had water wit our meal except for my husband who had a drink from the bar.    After dinner we played in the arcade. There are a vast amount of games to choose from. We bought a 6 player combo pack which amounted to $25 a person. Some of the games were expensive to play at 11.8 credits!   My husband and I managed to collect 4700 tickets from playing. We figured we could get something good with that however we were mistaken. The staff in the ticket store weighed our tickets to tell us how many we had. Most of the items we could purchase with our tickets were garbage. Cheap stuffed animals, cheesy toys. Anything for adults was on the 20,000 ticket range. Info isn't his odd since this is supposed to be an adult version of Chuck E Cheese.   There were a lot of kids there which surprised me as it was my understanding it was supposed to be geared more to adults. I saw signs posted about minors under 19 had to be accompanied by an adult but saw tons of young kids running around the arcade room. There is a bar right in the middle of the action!   All in all was a fun night. Don't think I would go back there again but glad for the experience.   Side note: bathrooms are disgusting and located in the arcade so patrons in the sports bar and dining room have to enter through there. Maybe that's why the staff forgets to tend to them."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and don't eat at Dave & Buster's, ever!    I used to be a huge fan as it is one of the few places where you can eat, grab drinks, bowl, and play arcade games but it seems in the past few years, Dave & Buster's has steadily gone downhill.    We have now eaten at D&B on two separate occasions over the past two months and the food was horrendous.  This past time, my fiancee ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad (pretty simply) and I ordered a hamburger (pretty simple).  I'm sure you are now thinking, \"how can they mess that up?\"  The salad came out with lettuce that was withering, chicken that looked like rubber and was cold, and as you can imagine, it tasted just as bad.  The hamburger I received looked like the bun had been sitting in their kitchen since bread was first invented and the meat had a taste unlike that of hamburger.  On top of it all, we left with quite a sick feeling in our stomach.  If you want to go to D&B for games, I would still recommend it.  It's a fun environment, although a little overpriced, but it's nice once in awhile.  Just make sure you eat BEFORE you go!"}
{"text":"Came for late dinner. Took 15 min got a menu. Waiter was very friendly and helpful but food was greasy and drinks were so bad we couldn't drink them."}
{"text":"Celebrated my little nieces birthday and had dinner here as well. We arrived early to eat and then have time to play. Surprisingly, it was pretty empty when we arrived Friday evening. We were seated and our waitress came right on over to take our drinks.   We all ordered something to eat and he made sure to keep our drinks refilled and that we had everything that we needed. Our service was good and the food well the food was ok.   The arcade is great as there are many games to play from. The new VR rollercoaster was not worth the $5 a person fee as it was pretty boring and definitely needed improvement.   The bar was being remodeled so I can't wait to see what it will look like."}
{"text":"This is the only place where it is socially acceptable to drink and drive...a simulated Daytona race car, that is!   If you're too old to go to Chuckie Cheese and too young to have kids, this is where you go for a night of arcade games and prizes you will never use. Not a terrible way to spend a 22-29th birthday.  You buy a card, load it with chips, and off you go. There's basketball, deal or no deal, fruit ninja, air hockey, zombie shooting games, crazy taxi, ddr, guitar hero - the list goes on and on.  While dinner service is pretty slow, it's understandable given the volume of people around on the weekends. I had the mountain of nachos and my fiancé had the buffalo wing burger. Both were pretty good. Don't expect a gourmet meal, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Was very excited to have my very first dave and busters experience this past Friday, but unfortunately I will not be returning, at least not to this location, because the customer service is horrible.  The bar was pretty packed but most of the bartenders didn't seem to have any urgency, probably took at least 10 to 15 mins to order with them.  Our server at our table, Rebecca, was by far worse than the bartenders though.  She appeared to write down our order but then came back 5 mins later asking us about our orders again.  Every time she came to the table she had some excuse as to why something took so long or wasn't right and always had someone else to blame.  I hate when servers complain all the time.  Before our food came we ordered a blue moon, Rebecca told us she would get it after she got all the other drinks she needed to get for other customers, as if we were being a nuisance.  We got our food which was luke warm so probably had been ready for a while, then had to request silverware from another server.  Still waiting on a beer.  Ate all our food, still waiting on our beer.  Cleaned up our plates, still waiting on our beer.  Eventually Rebecca came up to our table and placed the receipt on the edge without asking if we needed anything else and said \"oh did you still want that blue moon\"  we told her no and she said \"I didn't think so\" and walked away.   Rebecca is not meant to work in the service industry.  Was a little dissapointed later on in the night that when we went to the bar at 1:30 am the bartender told us that they had already called last call when you close at 2."}
{"text":"WHAT AN AWESOME AFTERNOON that I had here!!!! We went with some coworkers to have lunch and spend the day - coming here was the best idea ever.  Games room is enormous and full of all the arcade games that you can imagine and more, and there is another section of casino-like machines and roulettes where you can also play and win tickets for prices in the process.  Lunch was good, typical american menu (we ate nachos, guacamole, fried chicken...), it was nothing out of the ordinary, what stands out are the games.  Will come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii and Texas i was hoping it would be somewhat similar. It wasn't. It is the smallest Dave and Buster i've seen. Food was mediocre at best. Had the caveman special and the chicken queso appetizer.  Appetizer came out after i was done with my actual dinner. Ughhh. Took forever to get water refills.  It was super loud even in the restaurant side. You can hear everything from the arcade side. They should have had a better layout planned like keeping the restaurant further away from the bar and arcade like every other DnB I've been to.  Arcade side is small. It concentrates more on carnival things more than actlual arcade. There are no fighting games but a lot of carnival games and games i have on my phone."}
{"text":"A few of the games weren't working properly. For example, the walking dead game had a fun that only worked half the time. The air hockey table for 4, we had time left but pucks were not returned to us so we had to just quit.  Could do a better job of letting us know where to eat. We've been to eat before and we aren't greeted, we don't know what area to go, and it takes a bit to get anyone to notice us. We had to wait for a table to be cleaned to have anywhere to sit, which is fine but if you are only going to limit your space, there should be enough to accommodate everyone."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had in a very long time. We arrived to celebrate a friends birthday at about 10pm. The clerk charged us for more than we asked in chips, but that wasn't a big deal. We played two games and then sat to order food. We were then, a few minutes after ordering warned of last call since they were closing early for an after Prom. None of this is an issue to me other than we were not told at 10pm when we were charged $10 in cover charges $40 in tokens, and then ordered a $50 dinner only to be by no less than 6 staff members that we were to be leaving. When I spoke to \"a manager\" named Maxwell, he showed no sympathy saying or game cards which could not be refunded, blamed me for not seeing the sign on the door (that was held open to me) and that they've been there for two weeks. He gave NO resolution and didn't offer any sympathy and basically said \"tough.\" If the business really wanted to accommodate the after prom without robbing folks like me of $100 an hour before close, the restaurant and bars would have closed at 10pm to be ready by 11 instead of causing an experience as horrendous as this. The fact that my game card never expires, as Maxwell told me four times, is no relief given that I live an hour and a half away and come here maybe once a year. What a waste of my time and a disappointment to my friend only wanting to celebrate her birthday."}
{"text":"Dave & Busters is a fun place that my boyfriend and I have been going to for many years, (back when it was Jillian's) and always have a good time. The games are fun, the bowling alley is cool, the drinks are good I mean what's not to like. I will admit the food is not the best but it's a game place so who really goes there to eat? They change the games every so often to keep up to date & I love the \"casino\" feeling games where you win tickets when you push tokens over the edge. How funny it is to sit and watch grown adults so into games!  Its even fun to take the kids with us sometimes (shhh don't tell them we go by ourselves on 1/2 price game day!) our 4yr old is at the age where he really gets into some of the games. We take family here when they come in town for a fun night as well.  Dave & Buster's gets 4 stars in my book, really no complaints here."}
{"text":"They were showing the UFC fight with no cover charge. Plenty of t.v.s. Had the best tasting burger ever in my life called \"The Southern Burger.\" It has that superior hamburger like kobe or angus and they add roast beef to it. Got mine without the peppers. Service was good after the initial long wait at the bar."}
{"text":"Was impressed by the new menu and new decor.   Our waitress was nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  However, the rest of the staff was less than stellar.  There was a power outage (less than one minute) while we were paying games (sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened). My family and I were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.   The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  After the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.  Kinda a bummer we lost so much money on (malfunction) game play tonight."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in awhile. The food is decent enough, perhaps a tad overpriced and leaning heavily on appetizers. Happy Hour seems to be the best deals. They always have a great deal on playing games. Sign up for the email specials and almost every week there is a buy $10 or $20 and get the same amount free. Plenty of new and interesting games - my favorite was the Ghostbusters and motorcycle racing. As for food, the Philly Cheesesteak was $11.99 fully loaded with veggies. Not too bad, the meat was actually pretty decent - probably ribeye."}
{"text":"The arcade is pretty awesome (SKI BALL!!! YES PLEASE!!!) and in the few times I have been here, the games seem to be well maintained.  Sometimes, I just want to pretend to be a kid again yet still be able to be an adult and drink a beer while being one (uh, wait.  What?  Eh, you get what I mean).   If you want to waste a couple of hours and have some mindless fun, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Pros: Great games for kids and adults of all ages. There are only a few \"gun\" games and those are easily avoided if you have little ones (or big ones). For $25 the three of us played about 15 games which took us about 30 minutes. This was perfect amount of time for a 4 year old plus mom and dad looking forward to dinner after. The games seemed modern and felt pretty clean.  Cons: The smell (upstairs) of spilled beer made me feel as if I jumped back in time to the crappy bars of my early twenties. Bartender didn't seem knowledgable about the beers - I asked for a Laganitas and she didn't know what I was talking about, but the beer was on the menu. My husband went back and showed her that they do carry it.  We did not eat here - so I can't comment on the food. The downstairs bar smelled much better than upstairs. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  It is like an adult Chuck-e-Cheese with beer, booze and drunk people.  Problem being, still had little kids there and the interaction between the kids and drunks are probably not the best thing.  Beer selection was unimpressive.  Basic beers, one beer I wanted to try was dried out on the tap.  Girl behind the bar said that it has been out for 3-weeks.  I am not the smartest but if a tap dries out for almost a month, it is time to replace the beer or order more and not just leave up the tap to advertise something people cannot have.  We went there because we had a buy $20 get $20 in free in game play.  Games were okay, some really out dated and beat up.  We did not eat the food, just played games and basically to sober up between our trip from Fat Heads to Buckeye Brewery.     My option is that the kids should stay at Chuck-e-Cheese and let the adults enjoy Dave & Buster's."}
{"text":"Sad to do it but I have to rate our dining experience unsatisfactory. Our server was decent but the food was not what I would call sufficient for the price. First the kids mac and cheese plate didnt come with a side. As a whole my daughter doesn't eat much but for the amount of Mac and cheese she received a side would have been nice as she was still hungry asking if she could get another order. Second and the real reason for two two star I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. Now I maybe I'm wrong here but when I picture a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich it is kind of a more than you can handle, mouth watering, how am I going to fit that in my mouth kind of picture. Let's just say that's not what I received. I brought it up to the manager thinking maybe they were short on product or in a hurry and I was informed that it is portioned exactly and that she'd be happy to bring me out some extra meat. Which she did do but what about the cheese and peppers? On the bill she charged me $4.99 for the meat and discounted me a customer discount of $4.80. Over all we will not be dining here in the future."}
{"text":"The kids like it.  The restaurant seems to have gotten a little better.  The main issue I have is that they always try to get you to buy supercharged meals than include a power card.  So you could pay $25 for a cheeseburger but then get a $20 power card.  The problem occurs when it's time to tip the server.  They expect you to tip them based on the full powered-up price ($25) even though the meal itself was only worth ($8-10)."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  I took my son for his 16th birthday.  It was about 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  First, we decided to eat because it was not busy in the restaurant.  There were 6 of us.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food.  When it came out it was COLD!  The steak salads were really good but one of the steaks was over cooked and both were cold.  The others got the buffalo burger with tater tots...also cold. The guys didn't care, they are it cold.  It's not cheap to eat here either so I was not happy.  We mentioned to our server that the food had been sitting and was cold. I watched as she spoke to the manager about it and he was clearly angry, waiving his hands and shaking his head.  He came over and asked what we wanted.  We didn't \"want\" anything.  We explained were just making him aware of the situation.  He ended up comping the food 50% and giving each of us a $5 game card, which was nice. The women's bathrooms were HORRIBLE!!!  I would compare them to a men's prison!!!  50% of the toilets were stopped up and it was clear people were still using them with urine and toilet paper up to the top of the seat.  One literally had feces smeared on the seat down the front of the toilet.  My niece and I almost vomited!!  We had to go out into the mall to find a clean toilet.  When we came back, I waived down a woman who appeared to be a manager.  I asked if she was and she said she wasn't and that there were several.  SEVERAL MANAGERS and the service, food and bathrooms were sub par.  I asked if she was aware of the condition of the women's bathroom she said she wasn't.   Well I explained to her the current situation.  She said she would let the manager know.  Very Disappointing and embarrassing for my sons bday guests.  I asked for small plates to serve the cake I brought, well the plates came out hotter than our food!!!!  I will NEVER patronize this location again!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. We had a machine not deliver our cards (Star Trek). We called for help and they opened the machine. They didn't even bother looking hard enough before essentially telling us we were full of it. That's garbage. We spent $20 each (total of $40) which is an all time low for us at D&B. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and to any Dave & Buster's. We told the greeter this was our first time. He took time to explain the layout games, bars and sit down areas for dining. He was very nice. We sat ourselves and we're greeted right away by Santana. She even knew it was our first time here. She explained the menu and was very patient with all our questions. The food was great and very reasonably priced for the serving sizes too. Overall this was a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not the first time I've been here but always have a good time coming here for the large selection of arcade games. They'll usually ask for ID when you enter, since you need to be 19 or over. I would say it's best to come on Wednesdays since games are half price. Haven't tried the food here but there are also a lot of seats and space to sit and eat or drink. Always enjoy my time when I come to dave and busters with friends!"}
{"text":"Went with family last night early before crowds came in.  Got seated right away and server Ana was prompt and responsive taking our orders for both beverages and drinks.  She did a great job explaining the meals card upgrades which we took advantage of and were a good deal.  Food came out hot and delicious with only negative being on my plate (Caveman Combo) where the ribs were way overloaded with pepper to the point fhey were unedible.  Management made it right by taking the charge off the bill.  We will be back, highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you want to have a good time, don't come here. horrible service to say the least, they definitely need new and more bartenders."}
{"text":"Fun to play games but the prices are a ripoff & the prizes are cheap dollar store items OR impossible to achieve decent prizes. People working there are incompetent & rude seemingly no common sense. I spent my hard earned tickets on \"Kinetic Sand\".... It's all over the place. It is NOT kinetic sand because it makes a huge mess!! Very disappointed with this place. First time coming here & will never come back."}
{"text":"GAMING: I'm giving four stars for the gaming experience and cleanliness of the place. The prizes are much nicer, it's easier to win more tickets, the greeters and cashiers were more exciting and welcoming, you get help right away if something was wrong with the machine, bathrooms are super clean. Like it much better than gameworks and much closer to home.   RESTAURANT:  FOOD was okay but to be fair, we only ordered appetizers   If you order the mini burgers and wings to share, it's basically the same as the kids meal menu. Little patties in tiny Hawaiian buns and little four pieces of chicken.  Same thing if you order the buffalo wings. Cute Tiny pieces that should be a kids meal menu.   Pineapple coconut snow cone was tasty but more like a slushie. Coronaritas were bomb.  SERVICE was bland at best. Mentioned it was our first time there, waitress really had nothing to offer or upsell to us. We've eaten everywhere in downtown summerlin and every person that waited on us were much more enthusiastic. So we were somewhat surprised at the lack of energy since it's grand opening week. It was busy on a Tuesday night but there were plenty of help from the look of it.  When we paid, we gave her a $100bill to break against a $70 charge, she gave change back in all singles and quickly walked away.  it would have been polite to mention if you ran out of change and maybe say have a great day."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was horrible. We were there for a birthday party and one of the kids did not receive her food with the rest. The waiter didn't even notice that a meal was missing. We had to tell him. By the time her food came out everyone was done. It took longer to receive her quesadilla than it took to bring our initial meals. How long does it take to make a quesadilla? Did he even bother to expedite since it was their screw up? We kept seeing all this other food come out but not the quesadilla. It isnt even busy. Also, check if your customers need refills. There's a thought."}
{"text":"It should be made aware to the public that your private conversations are over listened by the bartenders and reported to the manager. I can only presume that this establishment has an ongoing issue with \"solicitation\" occurring, based on the statement made to me by the manager. Not a place I would recommend for dining. It was obvious customer service is not a high priority, food was bland, and drinks were over priced. Experience was so bad, it prompted me to actually post a review...first one..ever. Will never go back or recommend this place for my company events."}
{"text":"I like this D&B because it's new. It's in a really great spot too! There's a lot of stuff to do around the Westgate area. D&B has a decent amount of games and two (?) pool tables. The bar is pretty awesome.  The bartenders Zel and Ryan are freaking awesome. It took them a while to get to me on a Friday night but that's okay. I understand it was peak business time. Their amazing social skills made up for the wait. Haha Ryan made my drinks and they were freaking BOMB! Yummy yum yum! He also has some sweet flipping skills.   LETS TALK FOOD The loaded tater tots were pretty good. The Mac and cheese is the bomb diggity. I've tried the pretzel pull apart thingy and that was really stale. Each time I've been there, the wait was a little long whether it was waiting for the food or waiting for service.  The only things I wish I could change is that I wish it were bigger. More room for more games/activities and more room for breathing! Also, less wait time and more awareness would be cool lol  EL FIN!"}
{"text":"Bday lunch for daughter... Everything from waiting to be seated to the wait for our lunch has been quite unimpressive :-(  Been here 1.5 hrs, and we've only had drinks. Forget refills, waiter hasn't been back... We won't be coming back. Wld walk out if son wasn't here to attend a party for his friend"}
{"text":"Young and black, be prepared to feel discriminated against. I'm white, my best friend is black. We both walk in, and the general manager standing in front immediately asked my friend for her ID.  Now. There's no problem being carded. We get carded all the time. What we do have a problem with is ONLY her being asked for an ID. Dave and Buster's age policy is under 18 must be accompanied by someone over 25. There's only a 4 year difference between us. Even if he thought she was under 18, there was no reason not to also card me to make sure I was the right age to accompany her.   When someone gets carded in a group, you card the group. Especially if the only person you feel like carding is black and you explicitly tell their white friend they don't need their ID, but you'll look \"if it makes her feel better\". And then proceed to tell the 22 y/o woman you just carded you're a \"pretty good judge of age\" trying to defend not carding her friend. Not to mention NONE of our other baby faced white friends who came in later got carded at all. When we expressed how rude it felt, we both felt the apology was pretty blown off and he threw us a couple $5 cards from the huge stack in his hand to get us out of his hair."}
{"text":"Would of gave the establishment a few more stars for the great prices on happy hour however the service and management needs much improvement. I went to sit at the bar this evening with a few girlfriends enjoying our night off from the service industry, ordered what I thought was a jack and coke turned out to be Jameson, the bartender who served is 'Mike' I guess it was his first night behind the bar from being a bar back (that's what the girl bartender told us) and the girl bartender was trying to help him along the way but was too busy to honestly care about his side of the bar. We ordered our first round gave a card to be put on file, talked to Mike about ordering loaded cheese tots and hot dog pretzels. I guess he didn't put the food order in. We were waiting for our 2nd round of drinks about 20 mins in, the girl bartender asks us if we want another round and if we wanted food, we asked her if Mike put in our order, he never did, so she put in the order for loaded cheese tots and pizza pretzels, wrong item came out... it was a mess... we ordered another round after asking for drinks two more times from Mike that he never made, we sat with empty drinks for a while. After the drinks came, When closing out we asked for a manager to explain the process of what happened, the manager AMAN came over and we told him the situation. The first question before greeting us was the question if we ate the item. We said \"yes after waiting an hour bc the bartender didn't put in our order and the kitchen was about to close. The manager AMAN had so much attitude with my friend and told her \"well I was going to take care of it but now\" and put the receipt back on the bar top, told us to pay on the bar and walked away. It was completely out of line. If he would of just tried to hear our story instead of being so rude this whole experience could of been different. I was so taken back by this experience, especially coming from a manager. I do not always agree with the customer is ways right slogan however, I do agree with being kind no matter the situation. This manager was not kind, i believe that a strong leadership comes from the top and this is not how to run a successful establishment."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the bar!   My fiancé and I have been here about four times now since it's opened. The atmosphere is fun and we enjoy the games and food. If you're headed to the bar make sure you keep an eye out for Libby! (She is easy to spot as she is covered in tattoos! :] )  Not only is she friendly and talkative, but she is great at multi-tasking and very very attentive to everyone. Thank you Libby for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"Where to start? So we get there at about 330pm at 345 someone comes over says hi want can I get you to drink? Then followed up oh wait that guy will will be right over to help you. Then at 357 my friend goes to the manager and says is some waiting on these tables over here? She said oh yes I'm so sorry and at 406 someone came over and said sorry shift change what do you want ? Drinks came about 15 mins later food was about 30-40 mins later. When we went to ask about playing pool I had to interrupt the tall skinny male manager and 3 girls on their phone. Got the pool balls to play. Then went to get a game card same thing stood inline (there was none ) employees were talking or on their phone had to ask if I could get a game card. At this point after I got the card the food was there. Cold say under the heat lamp for a few mins. The tall skinny male manager walk by the table a few times awkwardly stealing at us. He came over and asked if everything was ok. At that point it's just time to go. We asked for our check the server said I'll be right back with it. 8 mins later it came. Had to find the server to pay so we would leave."}
{"text":"Wow cool place I just got here and Carlos the bartender didn't even let me order a drink within saying he needs a credit card to put on tab!!!! I haven't even got my drink wow maybe because I'm black. And there is no price's on the drink menu why is that? On food yes on drinks no!!! Hum"}
{"text":"We brought a large group to celebrate my nephews birthday. The service was terrible and the food was even worse! We ordered many different  platters  that came out overcooked and tasted worse than fast food. The kids didn't even eat it!  The waiter showed no interest in our table. This will be my last visit here."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 1 star because I have to but I was very disappointed. Went there and the wait was going to be 3 hours long but there were a lot of empty tables. They didn't have enough staff and there was a long line to get game cards. They should have been prepared for the grand opening but they weren't. They shouldn't have opened christmas week...it's very sad that the west sides dave n busters didn't go a good job. Not sure if or will when I will attempt to go back.."}
{"text":"So I may be a huge dork but I love the arcade in this place.  Half price games on Wednsdays is amazing, although it can get a little busy.  The food here isn't gourmet but it's decent and they're always doing the eat and play combo.  They have a bowling alley that looks pretty cool but we've never bowled here.  They also have a full room of pool tables if you're in to that sort of thing.  I head straight to the arcade to play one of the following: big buck safari hunt, pop-a-shot (basketball), ski ball, air hockey, and maybe a racing game.  All of their games are nice and new and they rarely have games that are out of order.  The service here is usually pretty slow so you'll probably have to wait around for a bit if you have any questions or need anything.  Fortunately you can grab a playing card from an automated machine without having to deal with anyone."}
{"text":"My service here was amazing!! The pretzel dogs and sliders were extremely tasty. While I was there my asshole friend threw a tomato in my drink and spilled my delicious snow cone!!!!! My drink spilled EVERYWHERE!!! The amazing manager rob came over and took care of us and bought me a new drink :)! Had an Amazing experience!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Very deceiving practices and a major disappointment.  They are basically thrives and overcharge for everything - charging gratuity fees for using an arcade. Definitely don't recommend supporting such business practices"}
{"text":"Food was great and the ambience was awsome. I was here for new years and i gotta say it exceeded my expectations it might have been a little up there in price but HEATHER made it the best new years in a while. If you are considering going here you must ask for HEATHER. Best service and great attitude."}
{"text":"Came here with a group on a weekday afternoon. The games are pretty standard, and it was empty when we were there, so those went well. The food, though, was pretty bad. The place was barren - totally empty. Yet we still had a pretty long wait between getting our orders taken/getting our food/getting refills/etc. If you look at the menu, you know the kind of food you're going to get. Everything is SUPER unhealthy, which usually translates as good, right? I mean, they stuff sandwiches with mac and cheese, how can it not be delicious? The food wasn't good, though. No one got sick, but it wasn't great. I ordered a steak. The server never asked how I wanted it cooked, and it showed up as tough as leather. My friends got things that were much more interesting, all fried and cheesy and covered in barbeque sauce, but no one really enjoyed the food.   I'd come back for the games, but that's about it. It's a shame, too, because half of that whole place is nothing but a bar/restaurant. If you're going to drive away your entire dining business, you might as well use that space for more games."}
{"text":"We went last Saturday. The ads say this is amusement for adults. The line to get in was long. Once seated, drinks took forever to come. The bar was much slower than the restaurant part. The food was average. Mostly fried stuff. There were so many little kids, not teens. It felt more like a Chucky Cheese. Not what I expected. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Location 5/5:  Love Tempe Marketplace and it is a wise idea to have a concept like this in the area.  Between ASU, Families, and Tourists this place must consistently be busy.  I was able to play some games, and then do some shopping.  Concept/Games 4.5/5:   Super jealous we do not have one of these in Vegas.  It seems like a perfect fit.  I loved the mix of arcade and carnival games.  If you are a huge gamer you may not be in love with the selection of games, but I could have spent all day trying to earn virtual tickets.  Sure most of the prizes are your basic stuffed animals and branded merchandise, but it is still fun trying to each the goal.  Also tons of tv's with sports.  Come football season or the World Series I may need to visit.  Food/Drink 1.5/5  This for me was the only real low point of my visit.  I order the Goldfingers as part of the Eat and Play Combo. The chicken was the rubberiest thing I have ever tried to have eaten.  It was essentially inedible.  I can see why they can afford to charge so little for them as part of the combo.  I loved my watermelon shaved ice drink, but will need to try something different next time or just stick to drinks and games.  Price 4/5: I found the prices to be reasonable.  At the end of the day your are paying for the concept, and the chance to win prizes.  I could see where some of the games could been seen as slightly overpriced, but all in all worth the money.  Overall 4/5:  Loved hanging out here.  Plan on coming back.  I just may choose to eat at one of the other restaurants in Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"This was a very fun experience here at good ole Dave and Busters. They have alot of new games and they also actually have decent prizes that are within reach in one visit or one card payment of either $25 or $35. We ended up with 689 tickets after spending $35 and we left with two real coffee mugs emblazed with the D and B logo. The basketball hoops and football toss and skeeball are still classics, while the other skill games with the flashing lights are also fun. The Wheel of Fortune is really tough, but the Trivial pursuit does contain some easy questions. We also enjoyed the giant Ms. Pac-Man game, but skip the four pronged air hockey contest. My new favorite was the crane game with the mini candy bars. Not only do you have to snag a candy bar, but it also has an element of sliding other candy bars into the box for multiple treats. Somehow, it is the cheapest game, but we had quite a nice snack from two big wins. Very nice staff also as we got some freebies along the way and one employee challenged us to pac-man with us getting a free game if we won. Bonus was not alot of kids for some reason on this night."}
{"text":"Fun!! I want to have my party here. The food was good and the games were fun. I like being money less and not having to touch coins, yay for plastic money! It's like the kid version of vegas here! Or the adult version of chuck e. cheese! Ill be back to watch a sports game and play video games."}
{"text":"I have only been to Dave and Busters once when they first opened there location in Orange County but I remember it was clean and kid free.  So when we went in to the Dave and Busters in the Tempe Marketplace I was really surprised to see kids running around everywhere! I don't think that after 5pm kids should be allowed in to Dave & Busters because for one thing there not being properly supervised by their parents and some pervert could run off with one of them! I also feel kids shouldn't be hanging out with a bunch of drunken adults, it's totally inappropriate!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to watch a sporting event as there were big screen everywhere. Menu offers a lot of bar food selections. Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"I love coming here to grab a beer but the food is disappointing every time. The choices on the menu are abundant, but just always seem to let me down. I think I'm sticking to grabbing a beer and playing the games. That hasn't let me down so far. Will definitely come back for the atmosphere, games, and beer. Not the food!"}
{"text":"Food: I don't know why anyone would expect good food here.  It's like pub/bar food.  Anyhow, I wouldn't eat here unless I'm super hungry.  Drinks: It's crazy busy here, especially when you are in the arcade area.  They must make so much money off of this.  Games: They have a great collection here, in my opinion it is better than Playdium.  The only downfall is that half the machines are broken lols.  Like damn it, just fix the machines.  Not only is it packed on a Saturday night, but now I have to wait until the next morning?  Anyhow, I always enjoy coming here to have fun and I'm delighted when they add new games.  Just come in with an open mind =p"}
{"text":"This place is FLOODED with children.  My ultimate pet peeve. Children should not be anywhere near alcohol, anywhere. The bar area is obviously renovated and to get a drink you have to shout out to a waiter to get one. The dozy Chinese waitress who was ignoring us was obviously high on some sort of narcotic, visibly. She ignored myself and my boyfriend for a full 10 minutes until we called upon another server who \"felt bad\" and then fetched us our drinks.   The Shock Top is off. Turned me off of beer conpletely, maybe even for life. Now I must say the only reason I give a 2 star intead of 1 is because of a drink that Angus, another Chinese server made for us....The Caribbean...oh my God the most delicious drink on this earth!!! Heaven in a glass. We ordered 2 then left then came back for another 2! Unfortunately the fat ditzy blonde waitress who made them didn't make it the same so I complained and they gave us a shot of tequila to put in then it was the same taste we craved.  Needless to say today we are going to the lcbo to purchase the ingredients so we can make it at home and never go back!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE, DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT GOING OR BRINGING YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY HERE. SERVICE IS THE MOST ATROCIOUS THING ABOUT THIS PLACE! ZERO STARS IF I WAS ALLOWED.   I've been here before with a group of friends who are younger than me and definitely do look younger than me and we were able to walk in freely, not being ID'd or anything. We are not drinkers anyways. We just wanted food and to play arcade games. That experience was alright, except the server service was super slow on an evening and the food was barely average.  HOWEVER. I CAME HERE ON ANOTHER OCCASION AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY I'D NEVER GO BACK.  I came here around an early Friday Evening, with significantly older looking people, my age. As soon as I walked in, I didn't even take 5 steps into the place when the receptionist called me over in a very rude way. She didn't say hi or greet me or anything. She demanded, YES, DEMANDED for my ID. When she saw that I wasn't legal drinking age, BUT 18, she rudely said aloud how she cannot let me in. Let me refresh, on their website, of \"House Rules\", you have to be \"18 to enter the premises\" (Dave and Busters Inc, 2018). For identification, \"in order   to consume alcoholic beverages, you must establish that you are at least 21 years of age.\" [which I still think is ridiculous] (Dave and Busters Inc, 2018).  Again, I was 18 when I came here on this occasion.   The receptionist had cut eye and demanded I leave the premise because I was not of age and I will not be allowed in. I told her how I am not drinking and I just wanted to play the games. She interrupted me while I was trying to explain this and told me to leave and I am not allowed in.  First of all, what type of receptionist is this?!?! Doesn't greet you and before you can even walk up to the desk, she calls you out for ID? How unprofessional. Secondly, she needs to be educated on the House Rules, because clearly she isn't. I have only been here once, from a previous time and I already knew you need to be at least 18 to enter without an adult. So calling me out and saying I'm not allowed in? And thirdly, you don't have to be so hostile and rude. If someone isn't allowed in, you can tell them calmly or alternative ways for them to be allowed in. Not just yelling out that someone cannot enter if they are not causing you any trouble.   At this time, I didn't even want to talk to a manager because she was completely unreasonable and rude. This has never happened to my friends or family and they are DEFINITELY younger than 18 without an adult. So for a receptionist to look at my ID, which I was 18, and then demanded I leave the premise, that was completely uncalled for. I understand making sure kids don't sneak in for drinks but ID was checked and under house policies, I shouldn't have been denied entry.  I know others have had decent or good experiences, but this was mine.  I have included the house policies below also.  https://www.daveandbusters.com/house-policies"}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible attitude of workers. Traveled from Reno to come here and was horribly disappointed on my boyfriend's birthday. Left before we even got our food they were so rude"}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like D&B is an excuse for adults to play games that they are way too old for, and it's still acceptable since everyone else around you is doing it. I do have to admit that it is a lot of fun.   A huge area with tons to do. From your classic arcade games like skeeball, to games you never even considered like Kung Fu Panda. Just choose what you play carefully, as it now seems you can play giant versions of games you can download on your phone. Unfortunately, you cannot be watching your wallet and playing, since you wouldn't get to do much.   Getting credits to play is quite expensive, so if you're going, just dive all in and have fun. They have recently changed their ticket system, where any tickets you win are automatically put on your card. While it may be convenient, I no longer have that satisfaction of holding a huge bucket of tickets that I've won.   Prizes are still unreasonably out of reach, but I believe you can now exchange tickets for food, which is an amazing new realization for me! Will definitely be doing that next time, since I have so many tickets saved up anyways.   The food here is reminiscent of your typical pub food, but always great with a bunch of a friends and while you're having fun.   Not the cheapest entertainment alternative, but a great choice to relive your childhood and spend some time with friends. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible! Ill never go back. The food took over an hour to be brought out, and wasn't even good. The games are way over priced. The men's bathroom was absolutely DISGUSTING! I even told them more than 5 times about the bathroom being under satisfactory and they didn't even care. Theres also trash on the floor everywhere. The employees seem to just be there to get a paycheck, and don't give a shit about anything. Ill never go back. The D and B in Jacksonville FL is SOOOO much better and friendly service and clean with amazing food!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their games. I have been to the Roseville location before and by far they have way more games compared to the Las Vegas location. However, I do like their rule about 18+ to enter in without an adult since Roseville requires 21+.  I'm sad to see they are missing a lot of fun games like the miner derby game where you roll the ball into different color holes.  There's still room for improvement but the location is still new. I definitely recommend signing up for their newsletter and membership because they always send coupons like spend $20 and get $20 free.  Go on a Wednesday because it's half price games that day!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I came here just for the arcade and it seemed very limited if you compare it to Castles & Coasters.   One machine also ate a lot of our credit and we reported it but the technician never arrived. Whenever a machine doesn't work properly at C&C and you report it, they're on it ASAP. In addition to that, the multiplayer game mode on some machines was not programmed so games where you could play multiplayer on normally like at C&C was not programmed properly here.   D&B also has pool tables in the back on the 2nd floor and a restaurant on the 1st floor. A bar with the arcade is on the 2nd floor and I believe you can order food there as well.   It was a mediocre experience. I would much rather have eaten dinner somewhere else and then have gone to Castles & Coasters. I actually will do that next time. And probably do mini golf too.  I mean if you're a fan of pool and like beer and have kids this is probably the place for you. If you like the arcade and want to spend most of your time there, go to C&C."}
{"text":"We took about five or six people here on a Friday night. It was fairly crowded at the bar but not so much in the restaurant part. We grabbed a quick drink and went to play some games. Some of the games were not working, but luckily a staff member was able to fix a few games that I tried to play that took my money.  The prizes are more or less for kids but you have to have a ridiculous amount to win. I would say go on a Wednesday if you can and make it worth the money !"}
{"text":"The bar is larger than the other locations but there's no shuffleboard at this location. :("}
{"text":"Upbeat and fun! I was looking for a fun place to spend time with my teenage son. We had outgrown some of the other amusement joints like PPP and Chuck E. Cheese's.   The WELCOME: D&B's a grown up version of the food and arcade business. It has a nice bar, happening arcade that almost looks like a casino and wide range of prizes.  Not So Cool #1: Inattentive hostesses did not direct us to where we were supposed to sit to eat. So we ended up seating ourselves where they were having a private birthday party and getting stared down.  The NOSH: We sat down and ordered one of the play and eat combos. Son ended with with a delicious medium well thick burger with well seasoned fries. \"Better than McDonald's fries!\" High praise from my son who loves fries. We got a great deal for credits on our Power Card. $18 for 120 credits.  Because it was Sunday, I got the Huddle Nachos for $5. The beefy nacho sauce, jalapenos, delicious fresh guacamole, sour cream, black beans and diced tomatoes were a winning combination over warm chips.   Not So Cool #2: The kitchen did not put enough sauce to chip ratio. However our server remedied it by bringing nice and warm extra sauce to finish my chips with. Way to go!  The GAMEPLAY: Everything looked so inviting. We were particularly attracted to the Luigi Mansion ghost-vacuuming game and Big Buck Hunter. We also played Jurassic Park which was very exciting. The best value for play was Big Buck Hunter: 3 Trek single player was 6.8 credits. We had a blast for a long time with that game. Luigi's Mansion was fun but you had to be good at it in order to play longer, same with Jurassic Park.  Not So Cool #3: 1 out of 2 Big Buck Hunter Machines were out of order. The Luigi Mansion and Jurassic Park cabins were littered with candy wrappers.  The Amenities: I had to visit the washroom.  Not So Cool #4: The ladies' bathroom was out of soap on one side of the bathroom, and I had to move to the other set of sinks. The toilets also stank of a combination of urine and cleaner fluid.  Overall, we had a great time. We signed up for their Rewards Program and will be back to play Big Buck Hunter. Maybe this might be a Sunday tradition."}
{"text":"Our grandchildren were visiting for the weekend so we wanted to go someplace fun. First, if you've never, it's kind of difficult to figure out WHERE is the ENTRANCE. From the north parking lot, there is A sign on the back of the building pointing east. However, as you approach the stage area, there is a staircase but, no sign or indication as to what is upstairs. So... Walk around the stage (& audience waiting for the band to begin) to find the entrance closer to the WEST side of the building. For a handicapped person this could prove difficult. I highly recommend a better sign/directions from the parking lot AND online. When you enter, you don't know what to do, as there are what appear to be 2 host/hostess stations, not labeled in any way so of course I approach the wrong one. A sign on the walls behind the stations would help. We were disappointed in the LACK of seating upstairs. There is additional seating outside but, it was still hot out & besides, on this particular night, there was a private party on the balcony patio. So, we went back downstairs, ordered & then my husband took the kid's to play while I waited for the food. Our server, Stephanie, was quite good: prompt & attentive. The food was good although, the mild wing sauce was a bit sweet. The pretzel dogs our grandchildren ordered were delicious, as were the loaded tater tots. My only disappointment here was the lack of CHILD size drinks: neither drank the whole, adult size drink. The play area is as expected game wise. I was very pleasantly surprised by the redemption \"store\". We're all used to seeing the \"prizes\" inside of a glass display case & on the wall behind the display case. At Dave & Busters, you can go into the area & actually pick up & look at the items you are interested in. The ONLY negative to this are the people breaking items &/or dropping them on the floor & leaving them for someone else to pick up or step on. At any rate, this prize \"store\" is a great idea!! I do, however, wish they would find a way to have more seating so a family doesn't have to be separated from each other as we were."}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was going to be all that great,  but it was pretty delicious. My husband and I usually go during happy hour (9pm-close) i just wish it was kid free at night."}
{"text":"It COULD be a great place....however, sit at their bar, and wait and wait and wait for service.....they have a late night happy hour....their PREMIUM margarita is 5 bucks.....yeah, premium with a tiny smidgon of tequilla. Even the couple next to us was complaining and saying they didn't taste like they have alcohol. And the head bartender says it's normal , 1 1/4 oz of alcohol, meaning sweet, sweet sweet yukkiness. And aside from the horrid amount of time waiting to order a drink, or another one (yeah youre still thursty after one or two, and you don't got anywhere to go) you ask the bartender lady how much is a beer, and she won't give you a straight answer, her answer, $1.00 Off, well $1.00 off what? Its a big secret, obviously trained to not answer, just the same as the reason they put in EXACTLY 1/14 OZ. of alcohol, thats the way it is nowadays, need to maximize profit, put in 30 cents worth of booze instead of 50 cents, but gotta make that money, but people like me, we won't come back, and neither will the couple that sat next to us, and I'm sure more....the place could be a rocking place, just another cheap establishment."}

{"text":"Over a week we visited d&b three times (mon, wed, & sat) while we stayed at the Marriott resort down the street. Kids (9 and 11) loved it as we only visit once every 2 months normally. Place was bigger than the ones we have visited on the east coast, though this is due to more dining spaces, special party rooms, platinum bar, patio dining.  Games were about the same. Except half price Wednesday,  the crowd was about the same. One thing, the ticket redemption center had fewer prizes, less variety and poorer quality than othrr d&b sites.  Had a beer and a couple of sodas, while we dined at many of the restaurants located in the square around d&b, like smashburger, nori sushi, slices pizza and coldstone creamery, which all offered better food."}
{"text":"Visited here for a company Christmas party. Have never been to a place like this before. No kids, so never a need to go. Being a company Christmas party I was hoping to not be bored. I was NEVER bored here. Outside on the District Stage was  SNOW falling. Well the appearance of snow falling. Inside was true fun. The food I will rate as a 3, servers a 5 and the entertainment a 5. The food gets a three because I gave the salad a true 5! The spinach and mixed greens were fresh and tasty. The mozzarella in salad was fresh as well. The candied pecans were delicious and fresh as well!! The salad could have been chopped smaller, but that is just my preference. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The potatoes were just ok. The rolls were very generic. Now onto the real winner of this party. All the games!!! There was skeet ball, video games, trivia games, shooting games, huge Pac-Man games, etc. This place was amazing. We each had $30 on a card and were alerted to all virtual games were unlimited play.  We played all night long. Won a new toy for the pooch and went home happy. Great company party!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Someone should shut down this place once for all...!!!  Very rude staff ( front desk) at the restaurant ( the main one near the parking entrance) Freaking rude.  Short african American dude with no glasses on. Did not get his name tho. So rude.  He claimed that they have over 4000 people coming to that place ... Bla bla.  Sat is their busiest time... Bla bla.  Well... My question was... Why is the half of the tables empty then why do you get us a freaking table!!! He said again... It is what it is and told me to have a good day then looked at me like I am five years old ( what u gonna do about it... Look). Omg I was so pissed off at this point.   When did we get a table? We waited 1 hr and 15 min for a table of six.  But a half of tables there were empty Again.  What were they doing.  What took forever?    It took forever to get out food.  Nasty food.  My god.  Is this hell? It is not hell but it was pretty close.  We are not coming back here ever again.     Never!!!!  Restrooms were nasty.  What happened to the mgmt here? Nasty sinks ...dirty very nasty dirty."}
{"text":"The food here is awful.  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront.  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.  I only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table's food.  I was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  All I have to say is no thanks."}
{"text":"Awful service! We sat here for at least a half hour before he even took our drink orders. When we did order our drinks we waited another hour for our drinks to get here. Apparently the bartender had to go to wine and spirits to get more margarita mix! Then we waited another hour for the food. I ordered the mushroom & veggie burger with fries. They brought out my burger but not the fries. I was with a group of 12 and 3 of us did not receive our fries or sides until another 30 minutes later. We are cashing out and some people still have not received their whole meal! The service was awful, I will never EVER come to this place again. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"Oh for Christ's Sake what the hell? We went in to the restaurant and there was 3 tables seated in the whole restaurant. We were seated and we waited and waited and waited. 25 minutes later my son in law went up to the hostess station to ask for a server. 5 minutes later a server comes over and puts down crumpled napkins. Takes our drink order and then says\" I will give this to your regular server I think it is Maria\". OK?? So then she returns about 5 minutes later with half our drinks the rest come a few minutes later. Then she comes back and says I guess I will be serving you. Appetizers were ok. Main entrees...LOL 2 come out we wait on 3 more. 1 entrée the steak is well done and it was ordered medium. 10 minutes later 3rd entrée shows up. 15 minutes after that the final entrée arrives. I am stating actual time not we are hungry so 10 minutes becomes 30 time. These are real times. All the entrees were mediocre at best. I am being nice to say mediocre. The games were fine. The food and service in the restaurant need to be 100% overhauled. Service especially. Management take note."}
{"text":"After receiving $35 in game cards for Dave and Buster's from my workplace for winning a contest, I invited my boyfriend to come with me last night for dinner and games. The dinner part was a mistake.  We first approached the hostess stand to try and get a table in the main dining area (not the bar). The hostess seemed really clueless when we asked her how long it would be. She just said \"ummmmm.....\" and turned around to stare at the dining room (for about 5 minutes). There were clearly a few dirty tables and some empty ones that were clean, but she told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So, we tried looking for a table in the bar area and found one immediately that another couple had just gotten up from. I hailed the bartender to ask if he could send someone over to clean the table. After waiting another 5-10 minutes or so, our waitress finally came over and cleaned the table for us.   The service was fine; nothing to write home about, but I do understand that a) It was a very busy saturday night, and b) we were sitting in the bar area and not drinking, so I wasn't expecting stellar service. We did get everything we needed within a pretty reasonable amount of time, considering the previous factors.   The food, on the other hand, was completely underwhelming. I felt like I wasted $40 on that dinner, to be honest. I ordered some kind of seafood and steak 'trifecta', and it was anything but that. It was kind of lukewarm, the steak was super tough and well done even though I asked for medium rare. Although they were small pieces on skewers and I do understand it's harder to cook those to a specified temperature, they were decidedly overcooked. I thought the shrimp were supposed to be in some kind of sauce and grilled, but they just looked like plain pink cocktail shrimp somebody had stuck on a skewer popped in the microwave for a few seconds. The best part of the meal was the rice pilaf it was all served over. My boyfriend got a chicken parmesan sandwich which he was pretty happy with, but I tasted it and thought it was kind of gross too. We skipped dessert and went on to play some games.  The games were great, no complaints there! At the end of the night we earned 1450 tickets which got me one pretty awesome stuffed elephant and a shot glass for both myself and my boyfriend.  Bottom line: Go for the games (and maybe booze); get the dinner somewhere else. There are way too many good options nearby to waste your money here on subpar food."}
{"text":"Literally been here twice && this place is a shit show. All we wanted to do was eat, their were no tables available and the wait was 45 minutes. In order to make a reservation for a table,  I was told that there was a minimum dollar amount that we would have to spend (which, only being 2 people that would be insane.) Service was shit, waitress' had an attitude and most of the time we had to hunt her down in the sea of insanity in order to receive service. Gave this place a second chance because I do love the food, and was told that it was open seating, meaning, once a seat opens up, whoever sat down first got it. So.... There was awkwardly groups of people staring at everyone eating for a chance to be the first one to the table when it cleared... where the hell do they do that shit at? I've been to many Dave && Busters' outside of Las vegas, I've never seen anything like this. Never again will I eat here, or attempt to. They need to get their shit together."}
{"text":"I love their chicken tender meal! They have good drinks and a fun atmosphere. I've been to a few Dave & Buster's before and this is one of my favorite locations."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time in regards to football Sunday. I understand it's busy during football. We came during prime time and our server Sara was amazing. We ordered the side car shots... mine was full and my sisters was at a quarter full...weird? The tomato basil soup was marinara sauce heated up in the microwave. We had a great time due to our server Sara who was always on top of anything we needed, but the food quality and management was below mediocre."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party at Desert Ridge Location.   Service was ok for the small party.  Didn't spend all the security deposit.    Wanted the balance placed back on the card.   D&b makes that such a hassle that the almost force you to get it in store credit."}
{"text":"We went to Dave n Busters in Hawaii and loved it so we were happy and excited to know one was opening here.  We finally decided to take the family  here but wasn't pleased  or impress with this place.  Some of the games  when swiping the card said card accepted and enjoy but then immediately said card error which then we had to swipe again and wasted credits?!!  The place is SMALL not much gaming or dining area like Hawaii.  I was expecting Vegas to be better than Hawaii, but I guess not.... it didn't wow any of us nor do we look forward to coming back.  I'd  rather make the extra drive to Gameworks!"}
{"text":"41 years of age and wound not serve me a drink! My license was expired and they would not take my federal ID!!"}
{"text":"I recently went here and I had a blast. The service was great, all the games worked, and the drinks and food were amazing. I had spinach dip, a lemon drop, and strawberry watermelon margarita. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with four games and drinks you can't!! On the menu items are delicious of tried several different ones of me and my family, bring the kids along play a game and food options for them also. Happy our offer some really great drinks at half-price, try the original snowcone it's one of my favorites! Definitely will be back here like visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"The games were fun and my daughter loved it but the service in the restaurant was horrible and the food not great. (How do you mess up chicken tenders and a cheeseburger?) We were seated and waited over 35 minutes (in a restaurant that wasn't half full) for a server and the only reason we got one was because we stopped the manager who only made excuses instead of just rectifying the problem. I don't care why we didn't have a server, just get me one.   Her chicken tenders had a weird flavor, my cheeseburger was medium inside (which I ordered) but the outside was burnt. The only way this happens is by having your grill up too high. I also ordered a side Caesar salad that was very poorly dressed. The dressing was in a huge clump instead of being properly tossed. If I come back, it won't be for quite some time and hopefully they can get it together."}
{"text":"Literally the worst dining experience ever!  Came for our daughters 15th birthday 9 of us total in the group.  We ordered nothing complicated and 4 of us including the birthday girl ordered the Sunday special of wings.  Everyone was served about 30 min later, except those who ordered the special of the day.  The food that was served was incorrect and it undercooked.  We were given no utensils, napkins( had to ask another server for them), no condiments (had to ask yet another server for them). 40 minutes later I went and requested a manager since 4 of us still hadn't been served, he came over said he'd get food out to them.  We waited.. and waited.. our actual server came by a couple times to let us know she had no clue what was going on.  Food finally came out and wouldn't you know it, they forgot the birthday girls order..another 15  min later after the manager comes back we let him know that she still hadn't been served and how frustrated we were.  His response.. what do you want me to do about it?!  We responded \"get our kid the food she ordered!\"  And in jest we said and we want all of this for free.  He looked at us for a minute said he could do that and disappeared.  Our kid eventually got her food, we never saw another server for the hour we sat there watching the end of the football game.  No apologies, no clearing of plates, no water nada.  Game over, we got up and walked out."}
{"text":"First time at a DAndB and we will be back. Large menu. Reasonable prices and LOTS of games. Service was good also. Very impressed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. The food was average and a little overpriced.  I feel that they could have a better array of games.  We went on a Saturday around 1:30PM. It was busy and a few birthday parties was going on as well.  Overall, I seriously doubt that I would return to this location.  I could have had more fun at home playing PS4."}
{"text":"I don't want to give 2 stars, because it was a Saturday night and our waiter appeared to be running around doing his best. But I feel like we had a 2 star experience dining for dessert here, which is all we came to do really. We are not Dave & Buster regulars, on this particular evening we were searching for a big dessert to share, so we gave them a shot. We didn't know it was open seating, being newbies, and there were a few staff members who passed us and surely noticed us, but maybe they missed our confused expressions? We were waiting for a hostess, before realizing there were none. So we grabbed the first open dirty table we saw, there were no clean tables. We waited just under 10 minutes to get our drinks ordered, another 6 or 7 minutes to get out drinks delivered. We ordered our dessert, which unfortunately took an hour until it was brought to our table. Although delicious, there were too many signs telling me to avoid simple dining at Dave & Busters on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Okay, where to start.....  I LOVE DAVE & BUSTERS!!!  We had such a blast here!! It's where adults can be kids again! We decided we were going to come back here a few more times before we leave back to Alaska.   The service was great. Kyle was our bartender/server and he was very nice and when our drinks were low he was there asking if we wanted another. The service was quick and the staff was friendly.  The food was delicious too. I love french fries and thiers are so scrumptious! I ordered the Bar Chicks which is the chicken tenders top coated with thier buffalo sauce, tomatoes, lettuce and blue cheese on mini buns. It was very good but a little hard to eat cause the chicken wasn't flat. It was thick in some places thin in others. I would recommend cutting your own chicken pieces and adding a little more buffalo sauce.  My fiance ordered the quesadillas and said they were really delicious although it's not sitting well in his stomach right now :-(  We both enjoyed this place and it's well needed fun!! This will be staple restaurant for us once we are settled here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Dude, you MUST get drunk here for happy hour at least once. It's an absolute shit show, from the consumables to the ambiance. Drinks are erroneously cheap, which is amazing and they have a decent liquor selection for whatever your tastes are. They have what they call food, about three choices for HH. Those offerings, and everything else on the menu, is targeted toward people who love Applebees, Nascar, Pizza Hut's newest abomination, vintage Disney and Warner Bros clothes - you get the idea. The act of getting blitzed in their bar is not super horrible at first, as long as you're not hungry. It's the random children running through the bar that offer a stark call back to reality. They cause you to drift your eyes past the blind Tinder dates and CPS violations. Eventually, you'll need to pee, that's when the real magic happens. Stumbling past the video games and future leaders of America is an achievement onto itself. Seriously, they should give out an award for dodging the kids and machines without incident. Onto the restrooms, but only the Men's bathroom. (The temptation to ask about the women's bathroom was overshadowed by the fear of being branded a sexual predator. Seriously, not joking.)  The Men's has the typical urinals and toilets with doors. There are four sinks, in sets of two at either side of the entrance. All sinks were manned by two tuxed-out sink attendants, at 5:30pm on a Wednesday. One man per two sinks, that's right - there's no getting away. They were nice enough, displaying a solid selection of bootleg Drakkar and the like. As I was walking out I began to wonder, do the kids tip in tokens? What type of reaction would occur if a 10 year old grabbed a cigarette, a splash of imitation Armani cologne and dropped a 5-spot in the tip jar? These are questions I pose to you, oh great Yelp reader. If this post teaches you anything, it's that sometimes when life brings you what looks like boneless chicken wings, you take another shot of Jameson (on special)."}
{"text":"I remember when I first came here when I was about 17. It was like a rite of passage into adulthood back then, no more crappy broken down mall arcades for me, where everything was sticky with the children's snot and the broken dreams of the game operator. Nope! This was the closest you could get to a casino in Cleveland at the time, so for someone who has a knack for games of chance, this was as good as it was going to get.   The decor feels very man cave-y to me. Stain glass lamps, dark wood, dim lighting, cherry pleather trim; which is fine. Doesn't really bother me.   The food is ok, albeit over priced for what it is. Burgers, fries, chicken tenders, steak, ribs. Honestly, once you've had Applebees, all that food just starts to taste the same. Again, its good, nothing special. The service here is actually much better than expected. I've never had a bad server or bartender here. Attentive, friendly, spot on.   But who really comes here for the food right? Lets get to the real pull here. I really like how they switch up their games so often. Yeah, they have their usual coin drop machines and skeeball... but almost every time we go (which is maybe once every other month) there's a new game for us to beat to death. I do have fun every time we visit. Expensive? Yes. But I do feel that it is worth it,   Here's the catch. While we do have fun whenever we go, we do not go when everyone else goes. Thanks to our work schedules, we have most mornings and afternoons free while working in the evening and at night. So, weekday mornings are PERFECT. We have the whole place to ourselves. No lines for games, no screaming brats, no moody teenagers, just me and my games. Go on Wednesdays for half price games too! Its SO much better than weekends."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Got there at 5. Waited over an hour for a table and then waited another hour for our food to arrive. About 30 minutes into the wait, the waitress announced to us that she didn't know if the hostess told us, but the kitchen is backed up because it's understaffed. When the food finally arrived, it was very poorly prepared (think raw burgers). One of our party never even got her food. We talked to the manager and he really didn't care. He promised my friend that her hummus would come out in 5-7 minutes. We never saw it or him again. My first time at Dave and Busters will be my last."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the restaurant portion of D&B. The staff was very unorganized and did not know who they were seating and where.  Waited 10 mins before anyone even knew we were waiting to be seated.  We took our $100 potential bill down to the food court and saved $65.  The games area is great, but the restaurant area needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Horrible service, first time here and the service was horrible from the moment we got there, we had a birthday party for family birthday when we got there we had to wait  over 20 min because the ladie on the front desk didn't want to do her job and had to wait for someone who did, so they can show us where the room was, after they take us there the food wasn't ready even that we make sure to let them know what time we will be there, then we went to play on the video games and were told that  we can leave our stuff there due that it was a private room and only staff member had access, well at the end of the day a present that we give to the birthday boy was gone and it was an iPhone, after we call the manager to tell him what was going on they start accusing us for living our staff there instead of helping us to look for it, will never come back to this place or recommend it to anyone even after we spend almost 1000.00 they just treat us like we were getting service for free."}
{"text":"Dave and Busters is a fun place to go spend a couple hours, watch a game, grab a beer and some food, and play a few arcade games."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience today. My son is here visiting from Wa State. The closest D&B  to him is 3 hour's. One of the places he wanted to go while he was here was D&B. I've never been to one either so thought it would be fun. We walked in and not one employee said hello. Although there was a guy at the front desk. We went to the bar area to look for a table and every single table on both sides of the bar were filthy dirty with cups, plates, and trash. Not one clean table. The place was dead. There was maybe 10 people in there. So it wasn't because they were busy. So we went to sit at the bar. Seat and bar were so sticky. No bartender in sight. We waited a few minutes but no one ever came. So we moved to the other side of the bar thinking maybe the bartender was over there. Sat down and nothing. So we looked for a table in a different section. All of the smaller tables in that section also dirty. I saw one employee standing there on his phone. A server passed us so I stopped her and asked if they could clean one table for us. She said it would be a min because she was the only server. I felt bad for her until she then disappeared never to return during the next 15 mins we waited. So we left. Very disappointing for my son and I. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very rude an unprofessional.  The place is a pig sty an with no cleaning staff in sight.  Also was not welcome to dine in was told to find open seating after I told the lady I would wait 45 minutes she wouldn't add my name to list as if I'm not welcomed reported to manager who didn't seem to believe me or care.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I have ever had in all my years of dining out. Bartenders can't handle the bar. Waited for refills and had to ask more than once before finally getting them. They brought my wife the wrong salad and then it took at least a half hour to get the correct one. Everyone sitting around us at the bar had the same complaint.  Gerry the bartender, get a job as a greeter at walmart."}
{"text":"Had the new menu item \"bowl of bones\" described as ribs these things came out of the kitchen as dry as your wife after three years into marriage. I don't know of they were kept under a heat lamp or the sun its self but it reminded me of sparky eating Christmas dinner in national lampoons Christmas vacation. I still love this place just stay away from the ribs"}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of D&B's food. Typically if I'm here it's to have a couple beers and remind my husband how good I am at ski-ball. Overall, it's a cool vibe with many different games to play. The drinks are affordable and you can't beat the location (Tempe Marketplace.)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Girl was just standing around talking to the other waiters as we waited for our drinks to be refilled. Which never happened btw. Never checked on us and had to ask someone else for extra condiments because our waiter was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time here with my hubby the food was amazing but the games cost so much an the prizes where ok but all in all a good time I'll be bring the kids with next time"}
{"text":"I wish I can give zero. Our waitress trash slow and didn't even acknowledge us it's cool though this the last time this bullshit ass place get my money they can kick rocks and a dick.  They don't like serving blacks in here let me guess only in the back"}
{"text":"Four stars just for the happy hour drink deals. Not much else going on here though...pretty dead for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"This has quite a bit of entertainment. While you're playing the games, the bar is always open for a drink and also they have a food menu if you're feeling a bit famished. The prices are what you expect for an adult arcade kind of style."}
{"text":"I was not happy with the service but their food was good, cold, but good. I can only imagine how great it would have been if it wasn't so cold.   Our food took forever to come out, once we received our food it was cold. The drink I originally ordered was not what I ordered at all, I let the server know but due to how long it took to receive it I decided to just drink it, I didn't like it at all so literally took two sips and ended up ordering something different (was still charged for a drink I didn't even order or drink). Now it was time to pay, I was charged for the wrong amount and my friend that was with me was not only charged for the wrong amount ($72) but charged TWICE! We then had to get refunded (wait 3-5 business days to receive our wrong amounts). Not ONE SINGLE MANAGER came to talk with us until I hunted one down and he said oh yeah I already fixed it. REALLY THATS IT?? No apology?"}
{"text":"The food was good, nothing too outstanding but it wasn't bad.  We only had apps...we got calamari, fried pickles and nachos.    Also got a strawberry watermelon margarita which was way too sweet and syrupy.  I had to water it down with some ice water to finish it.  It's always a good place to come have fun and play lots of different games.  Love the fact I can have an alcoholic beverage while playing games lol"}
{"text":"Probably would be a fun place except the local thug/ghetto trash that congregate there.  Will NEVER come back there with my kids.  Clean the restrooms once in a while.  I get the food is not gourmet and the wait staff is lacking(it is a place for fun), but the indigenous scumbags make it even filthier than it is."}
{"text":"We were told about a buffet deal that includes a $10 of gameplay. And I asked the front desk if it was worth it. He said it was and we agreed to do it. We went to the show room and purchased our tickets for $20 per person. Once we entered the show room  and we started grabbing plates, they told us we could only serve ourselves once. And I said \"so it isn't really a buffet\" to which a server replied \"it is a buffet just not all you can eat\".. but when do you ever go to a buffet that isn't all you can eat? I felt really deceived, honestly. And no option of choosing to cancel the order and just go to the restaurant. I know money has to be made, but it's not cool to get \"tricked\" in such a way and not have the option to opt out. It would've been nice to get some of the staff to be nicer and offer a refund considering we hadn't grabbed food yet. Or at least clarify this BEFORE you pay. Like come on. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"0.5 Stars  I can be 18 to buy a gun, serve in the military, and vote.  I can be 21 to buy alcohol and legally in some states buy marijuana   At 25 I am finally able to take my young cousin into Dave and Busters  I'm 21 now and thought there were no more ages to look forward too. However now when I turn 25 Dave and Busters now deems me an adult!!I'm so excited to finally be an adult in Dave and Busters eyes."}
{"text":"The Husband visited here on Monday for the first time. We drove from Roanoke, VA to have the experience and spend a night away from home. Our time here was quite fun. The time of day we visited worked out great. The crowd was minimal. We had dinner and loved it. The pretzel pizza bites are awesome. Then we spent several hours playing games and had a few adult beverages, which were spot on. The service we received from staff was appropriate. Overall, we enjoyed and would definitely make a trip back."}
{"text":"Fun time for all ages. The tokens aren't very cheap, but for a couple hours of fun, it's not bad.  The prizes are pretty unattainable unless you want dollar store junk. All that aside, I will continue coming since I always have a fun time."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Serve was good but we ordered two green shots and after ten mins the server came over and asked how to make it so I told her how to, which any normal bartender knows how to make but anyways we waited a good 30mins for our shots so I went to the bar to try to Order two shots and no one comes to me. There was five people st the bar with two bartenders a manager and a sever. No one came to me so I went back to my table and still no shots but I already received my drinks I ordered after the shots before. I called the manager over prior to all this and after a half hour on the shots he said they were coming but the drinks I ordered ten mins ago came out were out before the shots I ordered a half hour ago. I work in the business so I know how it operates. The fact that I can sit at the bar for half hour and recommend someone to my place of employment is really sad especially after it's their first time there is really sad. I'm more happy with the service I received from the game room bar than everything relate. Exactly why we received he received a better tip than anyone from there. I will never go back their for dinner or drinks. Games are okay."}
{"text":"I've always loved Dave & Busters but yesterday I went there for a few drinks and games after a stressful two days trying to fly into Europe and after two days of airport life , canceled flights, and unfortunate events. I definitely needed a drink and I was excited to try all the cool selections you guys had but I was completely taken back by the friendliness and just awesome bartender upstairs. It was a younger guy and he gave us a drink on the house and although it is a small gesture it seriously made my night after the worst few days ever! So thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't count how many Wednesday's I've been here. Why Wednesday well games are 1/2 off so my credits go longer. Kilt Lifter & Lagunitas IPA on Tap. The games are modern as well as a few old school. The 4 way air hockey is a blast.   I can't wait for the one at West Gate to open it will save me some driving time. If you didn't collect enough tickets for something good save them for next time. You can accumulate them in your card."}
{"text":"First time at D&B. After watching some of the YouTube videos I had high expectations. You see these establishments with 3 floors with bowling ally's and large dinning. Well not the location in LV. It was cramped. It's the same size as a crummy C Cheese.   We finally got a table that seats 4 that they tried to cram 7 of us in. Not to good there. Two people had to stand at all times.   The games were fun but I think they need a better/wider selection of prizes. I've been to the Johns Incredible Pizza that opened up not to long ago and they have three times the seating and the pretty much have the same games but they also have rides.   Guess I'll save the 600+ points I still have for another time. I'll give them another go to see if it changes my 2 star review. If not I'll go to the Peter Piper Pizza they are building and give them a try. Otherwise it's back to Johns."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. We had a group of 4 adults and 2 kids, all of us left disappointed. My husband asked an employee where to buy the playing cards, the young lady first felt the need to roll her eyes then respond. Upon reviewing the menu all the food sounded and looked good. The food was absolutely terrible. I had a burger which I ordered cooked to medium. It ended up being well done and super dry. My fries were salty they were just inedible. My husband had some regular wings, the sauce was decent but the wings had no crispness to them. So they were basically heated in a microwave. The other couple ordered the nachos, and were also disappointed with the meat sauce on top. Westgate has some great restaurants I literally could have eaten any where else and enjoyed my meal. Unless it's strictly to play games and have a drink I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Terrible experiance at Dave and Busters last night. Went to celebrate a birthday and went to the game room first. First game we play is the Jurassic park game. We sit down and swipe our cards and the game begins or so we thought. The screen goes red and our health goes away and we lose...but why was the screen just red? I ran all over the place to find a game attendant and resorted grabbing a waiter. He said he would call someone and to wait by the game. After 10mins of waiting we cut our loses and continued our night. We walked around to scope the place out and close to 50% of the games were out of order. Very disappointing when the place is packed on a Saturday night. We decide to go grab dinner. What a terrible experience.  We get seated right away and are given menus. After sitting there for 10mins we are greeted (waitress looked pissed off). She takes our drink orders and disappears for 20mins and finally comes back. We ordered a couple starters and our dinner. She tells us 10mins tops for the starters. I timed it just to see how long it would take - 30mins! Our food finally comes and for the most part the food was pretty good, however one of us got the fish and chips and received ice cold fries. Searching for our waitress who could not be found I manage to flag down a manager (in a red shirt) and tell him what happened. Instead of saying sorry right away like any other manager he gave attitude and said \"so you want me to get you new ones?' Of course we do!  After eating our meal we asked for the bill and because of how the night was going I checked the time it took for the bill. Another 20mins and she walked by multiple times. Before coming back with the bill she tried to serve us refills that we didn't ask for and when we said no she insisted and left them on our table. As soon as the bill came, fearing we would be waiting a long time to pay, we immediately paid and left.  In total dinner for 5 people (2 starters, 4 meals, and a side of fries) took 2.5hours. This is the reason why I didn't spend more money in the arcade. If I could I would rate this experience a zero."}
{"text":"Didn't experience the game room yet, but the bartender took care of us before going to the Fiesta Bowl."}
{"text":"Chilling with Kimberly Vasil, Mikey & Big Bob for the 96.1 Kiss FM Listener Appreciation Party.  Kiss really knows how to throw a bash- $10 power cards, free t-shirts, megaphones & basketballs, appetizers & n/a beverages...  Apps are flowing & delicious, everybody is happy...  Nice Bash Kiss FM...!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot, but got less...The food was not up to bar...Golden tenders were tough and chewy and the drink I got was ALL ICE for an $8 cocktail...really expected more for all the hype...the games were ok, but there wasn't anything special. The prices had a wide selection, but again were nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is good to come with friends once in a long while. The arcade is fun but it is a bit expensive. Altogether this place is worth it for fun with friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is great it's like a Chucky cheese for adults,  good food.  Our hostess was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I hate to say anything negative early on in this establishment's career in Pineville , but the experience deserves noting. We all had to take all  our drinks off the server's tray ourselves, including 10 & 13 yr olds.  We asked about the\"local brews\" advertised on the menu & she spouted off the normal beers on tap so we had to head to bar to figure that out for ourselves.  Server complained about having to go to the other side to the \"restaurant\" to get our local beer after the bar ran out. She asked us to put our silverware in a cup, which fell over & then our 16 yr old said \"do you want me to put it in the bucket?\"  Also asked to pile up our plates & had to ask 3 times for our bill. She was sweet, but sorely uneducated as a server. I am not a high maintenance customer, but we were asked to do most of the job for her."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars but you can't. Service was terrible and so was the food. Normally we have no issues with the food and service. Tina tried to accommodate us for the food by giving us 20% off, which is the military discount but we should have got the entire meal for free since it was that bad."}
{"text":"So decided to try this place for the first time for husbands birthday and I must say it was pretty cool. We decided to invite some friends and make it a no kids night.   They had no problem arranging tables to seat 7 people. The waiter was super friendly and helpful. We went on a Wednesday night and got to enjoy their happy hour and half off their games. They changed the tv closest to our table to the hockey game we requested.  The food was amazing . Once it hit 7 , our waiter showed up few and far between, so the on point service kind of fell off.buts a good thing it was so great to start.   When you eat, you get to enjoy eat, play combos and there are a lot of cool games to enjoy, giant PAC man, giant connect four, there's a roller coaster game that blows air on you, price is right, monopoly, no deal, and plenty more and the tickets seem pretty reasonable. We made out with 3,000 tickets between 3 of us and only used what we had from the way and play combo loads.   I will say I had a coupon in my email for signing up for the rewards for $10 , and they said they don't do any coupons on Wednesday because everything's already discounted. The coupon doesn't say that and our waiter had said I could do it. It discussed that with the manager and he was excellent at accommodating us with gameplay but still couldn't honor our coupon.  Overall my husband had a great birthday and we will definetly  be back again.   Oh and the prizes are reasonably priced. We made out with some good stuff."}
{"text":"The server was nice but slow, the food was stone cold, I usually don't like my food so hot I burn my mouth but this was like they pulled it straight out of a refrigerator, both kids and myself had very upset stomach's and we ended up leaving without even playing many games, I would never eat there again. Honestly the worst meal I have had in a very long time. The games we did play were average but expensive."}
{"text":"Go for the games and only for the games. I highly recommend you stay away from any food service. Horrible standards. Management is a joke."}
{"text":"I went there on 03/14/2014 and had dinner with my family. We also played but later that night around 11PM my son began throwing up bad!! he was sick non stop all night and slept on the bathroom floor with me ( I stayed with him). The following day at 1:00 I took him to Urgent Care to find out he had food poisoning and a bad case of it too! He was sick for a week. Then I went home and called I spoke to a manager by the Name of Nate and I asked for my money back. He said he would just send us some stuff that would make up for it, I said ok but guess what it is not April 3,2014 and nothing I live close so it should have come no problem. I am not going to contact the corporate offices and then a lawyer. My child got sick from chicken strips, I am not being unreasonable but I had medial bills and time off work. I feel that refunding my food cost is reasonable. I am highly disappointed, not only cause he got sick but because the ethics carried in the situation was none at all by the staff at this company."}
{"text":"Came in the first time and was told that we could purchase a game package for me and my daughter and they would split the tickets on two cards.  Makes sense; I am paying for one family together.  Then a few weeks later came back and was told that has never been allowed and we had to buy separate packages for all family members who wanted a card.  Someone needs to get the staff consistent on this.  It's also extremely family unfriendly to make us use one card for everyone or purchase separate packages.  Don't understand the logic."}
{"text":"If I could give this place is 0 Stars I absolutely would. Nothing is disheartening as a customer who calls in letting them know they're going to have a huge party and they want to spend money in their place, and having a very inexperienced managerial staff explain to them why they can be accommodated. That being said we've never really had good service here, but I was willing to let that slide if they would accommodate us for the Thursday night football game, which when I called it seems like nobody had a clue of how to set us up on a table with reservations for a private party which they do normally. I was put on hold at least four times, and all of those times I waited at least 15 to 20 minutes with no one coming back to the line so I hung up. I even explained it to the \"senior manager\" which was all of 21 years old, and she explained to me why she didn't understand or wasn't able to reserve a table for a private party, again other Dave and Buster's do it all the time. I asked for the district managers information which she was not able to provide other than any mail, and when I emailed the district manager I got no response even though I left my direct contact information. This just goes to show that in the mind of this particular restaurant, customer service really doesn't matter, that is the reason that the reviews are what they are. There are a multitude of other choices here at Westgate, which some are really fantastic and you should really check out, but by all means stay away from this one. Don't spend a dollar here. The low and negative reviews are very accurate."}
{"text":"We have never had anything but a good experience here. The staff is always helpful and willing to answer whatever question i have. The drinks are tasty and strong. There game play cards are on par as well. You can add a game card to select meals and you get double the game play points. The food is good as well."}
{"text":"Not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here.  But it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out.  I ate dinner here and the food was great i also played pool and the arcade games."}
{"text":"Met my family here for lunch before catching a spring training game. Two people ordered the chicken salad but it was delivered WITHOUT chicken. When it was pointed out to the waitress she insisted it was in there, \"um no, that's cabbage\". She finally succumbed and agreed to return them to the kitchen.  I ordered lettuce wraps which came out MISSING the dressing. I chose not to say anything because of the attitude with the chicken.  Later, when taking my first bite of soup I found a HAIR dangling from my spoon.   The thing that really bothered me was the response we received. Everything was just blown off without an apology of any kind! Our party was highly disappointed and living in an area with SO many other great choices... there are NO plans to return!"}
{"text":"Honestly I've been here so many times and every time we have to wait for the waiter or waitress forever to ask us for drinks then you'll get the food an hour later, seriously very bad service, whoever is in charge of this branch take care of it asap because it's really bad, plus the waiters and waitresses look like they just started without any training. It's not like the place is cheap! At least we spend $70+  every time we go there for a bad service!"}
{"text":"The arcade is fun with games that take you back and a good place to kick back with friends and unwind.   However food quality is very poor in quality and taste,  which for Vegas is unheard of.   Recommend to go there before or after dinner do not eat here as you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite Dave&Busters. From Cali to GA, this is our favorite one. So many great memories here. The staff is wonderful and Dave A. is Da Man!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for dinner on a Friday night.    There was a great vibe in the air and we really enjoyed ourselves.  We watched a game and had a few drinks and dinner.   Our server was very nice and had great customer service his name was Prince!  He was joking around with ya all night!  We had double chicken breast Alfredo and philly cheesesteak for dinner.   The chicken was delicious,  perfectly moist and juicy the sauce was not to my taste.   It was a bit sour in my opinion.   The phillycheesesteak was a hit!  The portion was huge and the steak was tasty.    Overall if you are looking for a chill and fun environment to hang out and watch the game check out dave and busters"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone's so mad about....Iol. I just went their Friday night and had a great experience. The food was on point. The little cheeseburgers tasted just like White Castle burgers and the wings were tasty too. I will be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Games, food, drinks.....its all in one!  There are tons of games for all ages. Racing game, arcade games, basketball, 4 way ice hockey....name it.    Food not so good but I highly doubt people go there for the food. Drinks! Well they have a bar so for those adults who like to enjoy an adult beverage here and there...they got you!"}
{"text":"Visited this spot the other day with my family. We were trying to find something fun for the kids that wasnt in the AZ heat. We had some lunch and then played some games. It is a great spot for some fun and games for everyone in the family. The kid in me loves going for some fun. The games we play on our cells are now larger, more interactive and a lot more fun. Games we would play with regular household items are now score keeping and setup just for us. Kids will have a blast, my son always does. There is tons to do and play to keep kids occupied and happy for a few hours.   The place has food, drinks and games galore so its great for a night out with some friends or a nice, cool spot to take the kids. The one at desert ridge has a bowling alley and area for parties. Great place for company get togethers and social mixers.   Only downfall was the super slow service at the restaurant. We got there and there was only two tables sat but we waited almost 30 min for a salad and pretzel dogs. We had to ask about it twice before our food finally came. If it was busy thats one thing but with only 2 tables before us it shouldn't take 30 min to get out an app salad and 3 mini pretzel dogs."}
{"text":"I love Dave and Busters. Fun for all ages, bar food. I prefer this location because it has bowling, arcade and billiards! It's fun for families, it's fun for big groups and there's a bar! Go play!"}
{"text":"My drink was good. All of the games were working and the place was clean. It's very loud here even when its not super busy. I can't comment on the food since I didn't try any. I didn't c anything to complain about here."}
{"text":"Worst place for food/service I have ever been even around closing!  They claim to have last call for food/beverage at 12:30.  They close at 1:00am.  We ordered Nacho's at 12:25 and 20 minutes later still did not have them.  Where we sat down at the bar still had old used glasses, a check, and tip still sitting there.  At one point one of the bartenders looked straight at me and never even acknowledged there was a dirty bar and used glasswear in front of me where we were about to consume food.  They were more worried about cleaning and eating their snacks behind the bar then the customers still sitting at the bar.  Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"My 1st time here tonight was a bust.  Got charged a $10 cover charge. I wish I knew the fight was on tonight cause I would've went elsewhere. Anyway they have sooo many workers standing around not doing anything or confused about what to do. The dining area is about the same size as gameworks. So we asked for seating. They said it was reserved but then another person said oh you have to wait 5 mins until we clean a table. Like which one is it. It's 4 females standing there at the booth but I have to speak to you first. Moving on I go to the open seating area and we wait and nobody comes over. It was like 10 ppl in the counter chillin and one had to be a mgr cause he had an ear piece. I go get someone and he is acting shocked nobody comes over and he said oh I'll go get y'all some water and he never comes back. . Anyway later on my daughter tries to come in and they wouldn't let her. Like help me understand why ppl are guarding the door and teens can't come in by themselves but they can walk throughout the game area by themselves or even the open seating area which is right next to the bar area.  If Vegas D&B was my 1st experience I wouldn't step foot in another one but I'll go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Our poor server was overwhelmed and overworked!  Our drinks came out after we were nearly done with our meal.  The noise in this place is seizure inducing!"}
{"text":"Good food and games, how can you say no to that? When we sat down, we were offered a dinner and game play card deal, which I would recommend if you plan on playing games for at least for an hour.   I ordered the salmon that came with spinach. The fish was well cooked and tasty. Food wise, it was pretty good. The selection of game is pretty impressive. There's a wide arrange of arcade games in over a large area. Plenty of fun shooting and driving games. They replaced the traditional system of winning tickets with electronic points in your play card. It loses the magic, but it makes it more convenient. In terms of prizes, you don't get a lot and the amount you need to win prizes is pretty high. Just go and have fun :)"}
{"text":"Really fun place to go and play games or eat and watch sports . Lots of opportunities for either.  The games are plentiful and the bar area for sports has plenty of seating and Large screen TVs to watch.  The menu had typical burger & fries kinda options with other choices as well ... from steak to salmon they had a nice variety.  I came in for a trial run and ordered a cheeseburger & fries with coffee & water.  The service was prompt and considering the room was full I got my food in a timely manner.  The burger was larger than I expected and was done just right. The fries were hot and the coffee was fresh.  My best guess is they'll do just fine here ! My team won so it was an excellent visit!  Thanks Dave & Buster!  Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"One day they're going to get the management together at this point they should just start over with all new people. This was once a great place when they first opened. Love the games... wish they had days for adults only"}
{"text":"I went to Dave & Buster's on a Wednesday with three other friends. We went on a Wednesday because all games were half price :) !   We all got the power play combo- meal plus a $20 card. My double cheese burger with friends and a $20 Games Card cost me $28.99 before taxes.  The food was mediocre, I was expecting bigger pieces of patties because of the picture on the menu. The buns were just as big but the patties were smaller so I was a bit disappointed. The burger itself tasted fairly bad until I asked for BBQ sauce which made it much better.   We then shared desserts; a chocolate fondue and brownie sundae. The chocolate fondue had a lot of dippable food , but very little dip! We quickly ran out of fondue dip but had a lot of the other food left ( brownies, pound cake , graham crackers , bananas, and strawberries). I had a bite of the brownie sundae and was instantly disappointed. The brownie didn't taste that good and the ice cream I thought was bad.  Games: There were a good selection of games, but I couldn't get over how out dated the games were. This is typical of arcades now, they aren't keeping up with the new technology of gaming. My ps3 looked better than more than 90% of the games.   Many of the games were broken which was disappointed as well. I really wanted to play the 4 player air hockey game :(.  Since it was half price games - I found it difficult to use up my entire $20 games card. There were a lot of games , but only a select few I really enjoyed. In the end I just end up playing games like wheel of fortune to use up my points.  The actual store was fairly expensive. After the $20 cards I won 450 tickets, my friends won 1050, 1000, and 350). If you have less than 1000, you can't really get anything decent.  It was still a good time because I was with my friends. We enjoyed ours playing the games together. However, I don't plan on coming back here for a while: maybe once every few years. The games are too outdated for me.   I'd recommend only coming here on Wednesday. I would've given this place a 2 if it wasn't half off for games."}
{"text":"Fun for kids, friendly staff, somewhat pricy, mediocre food; but let's be honest, we're not here for the food.  My kids were able to play for 90 minutes on $50 each, including playing on the crane and winning several plush toys.  Our order got mixed up, it happens. The waitress was quick to correct it and apologetic; however we got charged for the replacement item that was for the mixup ($20) and were also overcharged for an appetizer. They begrudgingly fixed it on the bill and pointed out they did not charge for two sodas on the first bill (as an apology for the first mixup). I was friendly over the situation, but noted I'd just spent $100 on game tokens and the nitpicking about free sodas is sort of petty. I still tipped 15% as the overall experience was fun and no harm, no foul. We paid fairly for what we ordered.  It's a fun place, but don't expect to get out cheaply, and to be sure, maybe double-check your bill at the end ;)"}
{"text":"The usual fun center.  You can play games using a play card which you purchase there.  Game prices can be confusing- - -  2.3, 5.7, 9.9 credits, etc.  The arcade can be fun if you bring some friends.    I didn't eat there, so I can't rate the restaurant part of Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"My husband, one of our friends, and I came to Dave and Busters to have a fun time bowling. Well we decided to bowl for an hour and I'm glad it was only an hour it was the worst experience of bowling ever. I cannot even describe but I will try. When you first walk in it seems like oh this will be fun. WRONG. The 2nd frame the machine glitched and would only have 2 pins. Finally they reset it. Then it glitched again so they moved out lane and said that happens sometimes. Well then new lane it wouldn't put the pins down. The machine also ate all of our balls which is bad when you're sharing...The employee working was obviously getting annoyed too. So I've learned if you bowl for an hour you get about 30 mins bowling. I won't be back. The only good thing that happened was the employee comped our shoes."}
{"text":"Never been here before, my boyfriend took me for the first time and I couldn't be more impressed!  Our sever was fabulous (Krystal) very knowledgeable about the menu, the manager came to check on our service as well which was really great. The food came out hot & plated quite aesthetically. We will definitely be back & with friends!! Games worked well only 2 we saw had issues. Overall you can see the effort they put into guest experience. We will be back"}
{"text":"Note to all: make sure to bring your ID if coming at a later hour! They have a really strict policy and won't allow anyone in without a valid ID.   The place is huge and the atmosphere is awesome. I liked my experience here much more than when I went to the one in the States.  Don't get hooked on the ticket games, because those drain your credits. I recommend sticking to the arcade type of games.   One star off because the price is pretty steep, and the wait for the basketball games, mario kart, those ticket wheel games and the 4-d haunted house thing.   There's tons of sitting space, but come a bit early if you're planning to dine in because the place gets really packed.  The staff is really nice and welcoming.  I recommend this place for dates, and for gatherings"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, so it was busy, but this place was extraordinarily loud. We got a booth at the bar and ordered food.  The food took quite a while to come out and while it was good, it was nothing special.  As far as the games go, they have a nice selection and things were pretty clean.  We had to wait to play some of the games, but for the most part it was walk up and play.  This can be a fun place, but the noise level is problematic.  I've been to another D&B that was not this loud and it makes quite a difference."}
{"text":"We did not have the best experience here, especially for me since it was my first time coming to a Dave & Buster's. The arcade part of the place was fine. Our group found a lot of the games fun and interesting and it's a really great way to keep busy until you're seated for dinner. We ended up killing time for about an hour before we got to sit down and eat.  I ordered the South Philly burger, which didn't come out looking as good as I expected. It was missing the peppers, onions, and mushrooms advertised on the menu. The meat was really dry, came out well done when I asked for medium. And it looked like it was sitting there for a while, which is not surprising because it took almost half an hour for our food to arrive, except for my wife's - hers took a total of almost 1 hour from the time we ordered. The french fries were okay. It came with the silver cup laying on the side, so I'm not sure what the point of it was. Presentation wasn't great, taste and flavor was completely lacking.   Not very impressed with the food. The manager comped our meals due to the bad experience, which we appreciated. We kept busy afterwards in the arcade, which is the only thing interesting about that place right now for me."}
{"text":"So I took a trip to none other than Dave & Buster's this weekend! Best and most expensive decision of the week. My companion and I paid $60 for 300-something game coins, which lasted us like two or three hours. I won the jackpot on a pirate wheel a couple times and felt pretty damn good about myself. Then I failed at skeeball... however your time goes, I think anyone can enjoy the different fun to be had here.  There's booze for the adults, games for people of all ages, and a dining extravaganza for the hungry! I'm definitely visiting Dave & Buster's for my 21st birthday this year. Gonna get drunk, eat bar food and play some more skeeball. Join me in my quest for ULTIMATE FUN."}
{"text":"I prefer to attend this place at night when there aren't many unruly and disrespectful rugrats. I don't mind little people but I rather spend time playing without them running around and bumping into everyone.  My favorite game is the trivia game.  I'm also addicted to the Monopoly game.  Wednesdays are 1/2 off, so anyone looking to have fun for a cheaper rate I would recommend Wednesdays.  If you don't mind playing at the regulate rate I would recommend coming on the weekends for late night. Maybe you'll catch me at the Mario Kart game handing out a fresh whooping!"}
{"text":"We went here Sunday to watch the football games, eat, play some games, and get our drink on. We sat up at the bar. Ryan, our bartender, was lovely. He was totally adorable and took care of us. We ordered the food and game deal, which I think is really cool. I got the Philly and a $10 game card for like $15. They also have happy hour during games. Blue Moons were like $4. After drinking heavily, we hit the game room and had a blast. The best game to win lots of tickets is the Nascar game. After playing so many games our heads hurt and giggling like fools, we stumbled into the store to exchange our tickets for awesome prices. I ended up with a Patrick stuffed animal and a pixy stix and I was extremely happy. No one bugged us and let us enjoy ourselves. I look forward to going back on Wednesday nights for half-priced games."}
{"text":"I went for the first time ever on Tuesday night with a group of friends. We sat down to order food and drinks. It wasn't a particularly busy night, and workers were just standing around and goofing off. We sat at a table and the server did not seem excited in anyway to take our order. I ordered a beer that took over 5 minutes to get to me. There is no reason it should have taken so long. She also was slow at getting us more drinks when we were low. Our food arrived pretty quickly though and we chowed down. We were ready to play some games after the beer and food, but we ended up waiting and waiting for the server to come by. She never did so we ended up having to grab a manager to get our tab. BOOOO, BAD SERVICE. I was not impressed.  The games were a lot of fun, and the happy hour is a tremendous deal. I'm severely disappointed the service wasn't better, otherwise this review would have been 4 stars."}
{"text":"Um.... Okay?  That pretty much sums up my experience with Dave and Busters.  I would not recommend this place unless you are into playing arcade games.    I went with some coworkers and their spouses.  We chose D&B because we thought it would a fun way to bond as a team.  We started off with dinner. The menu looked promising for American style food.... and then it came out.  Nothing was tasty, not even the French fries, who screws up French fries?  Okay, so we didn't go there for the food we went there for the games and such.  We were told that it was an adult atmosphere, and by adults,  I can only assume they meant over  13?  The only activities centered towards adults were the pool tables which had a 3 hour wait.  Also the whole upstairs was shut down for a private party.  We played a few arcade games to use up our $20 of purchased tickets while drinking a watered down rum and coke and then headed to Cadillac ranch."}
{"text":"Go for the games- not the food.   I'm a gluten-free vegan so finding food at chain restaurants is extremely challenging, especially with celiac which means cross contamination is an issue. However, they did have some guacamole and chips I was able to order. And they were very careful (even putting a shield over the tray upon delivery) with my guacamole to avoid any dairy contamination (also and allergy). That part of the service I was grateful for. The chips, guacamole and salsa were all really good as well as the two drinks I ordered (Walk the Plank), also great.   The rest of the service however was super, super slow. Everything was a wait, from placing an order to receiving food/drink.  I'm not sure if they were super busy and short staffed (it was Saturday night) and we had eight in our party, but even the water took about 20mins to get. At some point there was a statement that desert should have been ordered \"an hour ago\" so the rest of my party would have had it after their dinner. The arcade was cool, but if I'd known what I know now I'd have suggested dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Dave & Buster's before this past weekend.  it was my Girlfriend's birthday weekend, and we were looking for somewhere to visit and have fun after a night of failed attempts.  We decided to visit Dave & busters.  My review is based on my visit only.  It could have had 5 stars, but these items would need to be improved upon:  *  One two playing card kiosks were working, the other's were out of order and no one made any attempt to fix them  *  The mountain of Nacho's had zero cheese at all!  *  The counters were a little dirty at the bar  *  The staff at the ticket redemption/gift shop need to be more attentive.  They were a little to busy talking to each other  *  The games need to be regularly checked for working conditions, many of them weren't working correctly (Needing several swipes of the card)  *  Maybe have floor staff, in the gaming area, walking around as hosts and greeters.  it was almost impossible to find anyone if you needed help with a game"}
{"text":"My fries were cold !!! My sliders were made wrong the first the time because I asked for only cheese and meat no tomato or pickles and they gave me no cheese with pickles then the second time there was mayo tomatoes and pickles"}
{"text":"My son and I just visited this location yesterday for dinner. We sat in the bar area and had great service. I had a special drink request, and the bartender had no problems with it. We asked to share an entree and it came that way to the table. When my son wasn't ready to eat it when it came, they offered to put it back under the lamps to keep it warm. When my son finally returned (from playing games) the waiter said that the manager didn't like the appearance of his entree, so they prepared him a brand new one. Now, that's service. We had a chicken w/shrimp dish. We got a $20 power play card and entree for $25.  My only disappointment was that they got rid of the \"Deal or No Deal\" game!"}
{"text":"2nd time here, food is good, service confusing, to many different servers, couldn't get manager to change TV screen to football game, but they did have 6 screens on horse racing, 5 on the same college football, 5 more on the same NFL game, 4 more on local news.  Not a place to watch football. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This location gets two stars only because they have a lot of great games and Wednesday is half of games and drinks night.  However, in terms of food and service they have earned nothing. The food is horrible. I unfortunately had too many friends who wanted a birthday dinners here. Each time i said I'll give it another chance. Each time i was disappointed. Overpriced food that is not worth having a bad meal/ getting sick.  They just got renovated and i must say it looks really great! Unfortunately they skipped right over the women's(i can't speak for the men's) restroom. It has always looked warn down, horrible paint job and weird stalls. A place that looks so nice and new with bathrooms that make me want to just go to the malls bathroom.  So do what we do. On a Wednesday, go eat at one of the many restaurants around, then go enjoy half off games and drinks at Dave & Buster's."}
{"text":"Dave and Buster's is starting to suck. Their food quality is going down just in the last couple of years. The games are still pretty good. The overall value is heading south. The best meal to eat at D&B is the meal you have BEFORE you arrive. Eat somewhere else and let some other sucker eat this over-priced vending machine fare."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Dave and Buster's and we had a lot of fun. We didn't come here for food but just to play some games. We bought the ticket package that was $23, I think it was around 150ish tickets.  I thought that we would need more, but I am glad we got this package because that was still a lot of games for us to play. I felt like a kid again going from game to game and then of course picking out my prize at the end. I would have to say my only complaint is that there were so many kids. I guess I had always thought that it was for adults only. Not that it would stop me from going to one again."}
{"text":"Good luck finding help when a broken game takes your money."}
{"text":"Emmanuel was one of the best bartenders I had such an amazing guy great service will be back to see my new friend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for the fun factory, games, and all around experience, but 2 stars for the disgusting food and horrible service!  I was SO excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday. Its always fun to play games, win tickets, and have fun with friends/family. We decided to eat here before we played. I keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldn't be bad right? Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that's hard to mess up.   First off, service was horrible. I didn't feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren't bad but they weren't the best. My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldn't finish it. Was SO salty and just not good. For the price of everything, it was not worth it all. Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You'll save $$, time, and frustration!   I guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your tickets. Everything was pretty picked over, which kinda sucked. Overall it was still fun, and I am sure I will be back to play some more games!"}
{"text":"Went to have some family fun time today. They did not have enough people working to accommodate the guests. We were told it would be about 20 minutes to get a seat in the nearly empty dining room but the bar is open seating. We went with open seating. 15 minutes before the waiter came over to take our drink order. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time 1:50 pm. Our food came out 2:45 pm. The sandwiches were warm the fries were room temp and soggy like they sat for a long time. The burger was forgotten. The salad was pathetic and wilted and the soup was lukewarm. We were assured the burger was coming right out. 10 minutes later it did. I sent my soup back because I like hot soup. The manager brought it back and I asked if it was hot this time. He said well they just took it out of the pot. It wasn't hot but it was better than the first one. Honestly the waiter couldn't have been nicer. He was attentive and he was really busy. The management and the rest of the staff left little to be desired. And yes, they charged me for everything. I spoke to the waiter and he went and found a manager and had the soup removed. Kudos to the waiter but a big thumbs down to the rest of the staff. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"After going to my first NFL game with my brother to witness the Browns surprisingly dominate the Patriots, since this place was only 10 miles away from Cleveland, I suggested we head here to check out the Eagles (our fav team as a Philly fam) take out the Colts. I was surprised how big it was inside in the eating area. Granted it was a Sunday evening, but there was hardly anyone sitting at the bar watching NFL games on the TVs. The bartender was very friendly and the food was surprisingly delicious. Got a couple of the Power Combos that come with game cards. I was sad to see that the Walk the Planks are no longer made with Bacardi 151...they were delicious and would knock you on yo a$$. Now they're just delicious but girly. Ah well, they still have TNTs at least. I guess the 151 drinks brought too many lawsuits. DnB is a chill and cool place to watch sports events, but I've come to realize what a ripoff the game area is. I only really like the Bball shootout and Trivia game anyway. It'd be a great date place but otherwise I think I'll stick to the bar area. If you've never been here before, you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"It's a good place to take some older kids- or if you're an adult looking for some grown up fun too.    We save our cards and just buy credits in bulk... we end up coming here often enough that it makes the purchase worth it."}
{"text":"Whoever manages the TVs needs to be fired. Showing boxing and the local news during prime time opening week of college football is retarded. Sorry but when 99% of your patrons are here for a college game next door, no one cares about a week old nfl preseason game"}
{"text":"Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food."}
{"text":"Some economists have been predicting the collapse of the world economy. Currencies will be worth nothing and there will be pandemonium in the streets. I, however, will be able to weather this catastrophe for one reason and one reason only. Because in the end times I will be left holding the one asset and currency that will still be worth something....the Dave and Buster's prize ticket.  In case you have been living in the Batcave for years watching John Candy films, which sounds like an incredible life, let me explain how the ticket system works. Anytime you play a game here you have the possibility to win tickets. The more tickets you earn the more stuffed animals, candy dispensers, plastic balls, and crappy toys you can acquire. And who doesn't love crappy toys? Answer? No one. Everyone hates crappy toys. When I was little I used to make fun of this kid because his parents were poor and all he got was knockoff toys. I got Transformers he got Go-Bots. I got Robocop he got Robot Cop. I got a lightsaber and he got a laser sword. I got Pirates of the Carribean. He got Pirates of the High Seas.   What's also cool about Dave and Busters are the legendary skee ball tournaments I put together as soon as I get there. Typically I'll corner off the three lanes on the right and start waging war on innocent seven year olds. Tip; if they start beating you grab one of their balls when they aren't looking so you have one more chance to hit that elusive and legendary 100 point cup.   Bottom line if you want to drop $100 to acquire enough tickets for a Dora the Explorer glow in the dark pen then this joint is your spot."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if I could. We had to ask to be seated for dinner after waiting for 10 for to even acknowledge us. The manager seated us then took our order. We waited another 29 minutes for our cold crappy food. Our server came to our table 2 times and both time started his sentence with 'I'm sorry'. Should have just given me check but nooooooo had to wait for him to bring that. All in all there 1 hour just to eat and there were only 4 other customers. Then we tried to get tickets for games and they would not honor our app holiday coupon for 20$. It was for online we were told. Who plays DnB games online LOl. Contact me dnb and I will tell you where to send my funds back to me. Horrible experience and should avoid them. Was not even mediocre. Poor"}
{"text":"I would like to make it clear that this dave and busters was at one time my favorite place to come and hang out grab a drink with friends and let me tell you I spend more than $50 every time I come. But after Saturday night visit around 11pm ish I just wasn't happy with the service. For one I get there with my guest and the bartender sees that we just got there  and doesn't even ACKNOWLEDGE. Instead he walks towards some other customers and started to have a conversation( you kidding me right, was it because I'm Mexican and they where white, because that's how you made me feel). Like seriously, anyways and to top it off the bar was dirty and NO you guys were NOT BUSY. So please Manager tell your bartenders to ACKNOWLEDGE every customer more and don't make them feel some type of way!!!!"}
{"text":"1-star for the games 1-star for the great happy hour  I'm from California and I've been going to Dave and Buster ever since I can remember. Hearing that they were opening one in Vegas definitely got me very excited, so you could only imagine my disappointment. My boyfriend and I arrived around 830PM, a bit before happy hour so we could find parking and check the place out before the rest of our group arrived. The games are extremely fun! The variety is enormous, theres pretty much every type of game out there(just like I remembered)! My friend put his name down for a party of 12 and we were quoted 30 mins. I also work in food service so I understand that sometimes quote times aren't correct. But if you're under quoting by over an hour, then as a courtesy the hostesses should've let us know that it was longer than expected. Aside from that, our service was average throughout our meal. However, the quality of my entree was unacceptable. I ordered the tenderloin pasta with bacon wrapped shrimp. An $18 dish that tasted like it was only worth $5. It was also served to me less than room temperature. I understand that they were closer towards closing, but that doesn't justify them to serve cold dishes. Overall, if it wasn't for the fun games and atmosphere, this place would circle down the drain in no time.  PS: The bar is VERY busy. But it's expected, all the drinks we ordered were delicious EXCEPT the mango margarita. That was so bad I had to have it taken back and taken off my bill."}
{"text":"I will never go to Dave & Buster's again.  I was visiting Charlotte and friends asked me to meet them there for dinner and drinks.  Issue #1 - we were not given an actual table, we had to eat on a covered up pool table. Issue #2 - The server didn't know how to do his job.  He took forever to just get us drinks. Yes, it was a Saturday, and yes, it was crowded, but as a former server that was no excuse for him not knowing how to work his section. Issue #3 - the food was horrible.  The onion rings I ordered tasted like they were cooked in old grease.  I have never seen the appeal of this adult Chuck E. Cheese franchise, but I know I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I give it three stars. The restrooms are NOT clean. The staff are ok they kind a friendly...you have to watch them because you can be playing a game and they will unplug it. I don't know why this is but they give u free turns on other games should this happen."}
{"text":"Definitely a chain... So I came to experience it for myself and it was loud loud & loud.   Pick the appropriate seating if you don't want to hear children running around. That was my fault! The drink menu is mostly mixed drinks and light beers.   Great place for a kids birthday party!"}
{"text":"The service was awful,  first the hostess was not helpful at all, we asked for a table and she said \"we are doing shift turnover\" so she couldn't seat us so she just sent us to the bar area, we waited there for about 15 min and nobody serve us, after we came back and talk to her again and finally she gave us a table, waited another 15 min for a server."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my birthday with some of my friends. It was Saturday night so it was pretty busy. Luckily when we got there, it was seat yourself. The food here was pretty good. The Bucket of Bones was delicious. The pasta with the tenderloins and bacon wrapped shrimp was great. Service I wouldn't say was the absolute greatest. Our waitress could've come around more. A lot of what we asked her about different drinks or food, she didn't really have answers for. The food is a bit pricey and the drinks are overpriced too. I think our bill was like $300 for 6 of us. But overall, we had a great time. Not sure how often I would eat and have drinks here, maybe come back during happy hour, but I'd definitely go back to play some games."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I should've listened to the previous reviews. Service was terrible chicken was raw had to send back twice. Needless to say I left hungry. Broken beer bottles all over the bathroom with an employee just walking by. Very disappointed drove two hours to get there   Never again."}
{"text":"Lotsa Loaded Tots were crispy potato tots loaded with hot queso, crispy bacon and green onions, and served with Sriracha ketchup. I was not expecting the food at Dave & Buster's to be so delicious and great. These crispy potato tots were indeed fried perfectly to a crisp on the exterior but yet on the inside, it contained texture similar to a hash brown. The hot queso (cheese sauce) perfect PERFECT. We are both cheese sauce fans and this was so finger-licking delicious. The crispy bacon bits and green onions were the perfect combination to this crispy appetizer. The slightly spicy Sriracha ketchup kicked this appetizer up another notch too. I was just blown away with how amazing this appetizer was!"}
{"text":"The sever was very Nice! We were a large group and he did very good at serving the table.  The food however was not good. I ordered the BBQ pulled Pork sandwich. Terrible. The fries were ok. Overall the food was so much that I would not come back. Not even for the games. This location does not have the bowling alley. Very nice place however."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you really need to be in the mood for, but when you are it's a blast. The games part of it (and that's why you are going) get's the 4 stars, as does the bar on the inside of the game zone. There is something for everyone, trivia, racing, shooting, etc etc and the bar inside serves up a deliciously stiff margarita.   The restaurant I would give 2 stars. The service was not great and the sliders I got were made with a skinny little burger cut into 4 pieces. It was kind of pathetic. Also I ordered the same drink at the restaurant as in the bar in the game zone and it tasted nothing alike."}
{"text":"I preface this by saying that I am not really a video game person. At least not to the extent that my husband and son are. That having been said, I had a total blast at D&B. There is something there for everyone, in every skill level. A big group of us went to have some fun for my hubby's birthday. Love the prize options to purchase with your game tickets. Love that the games are pretty generous in giving out tickets---or I'm better than I think I am at video games.   I had a great time and I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Dave and busters and I must say the food and service was terrible.  I ordered a philly cheese steak and for one it was cold, cheese unmelted, vegetables soggy, the meat was like a steakum I could have made better at home, the waiter was a cocky smart ass...i can honestly say I'd probably never eat here or recommend this place.."}
{"text":"This is a great place for all ages. They have a dance floor, fun games, good food and drinks and is a family oriented place. I went with my friends tonight to change things up. We had a great time and we would definitely  come back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here at this location. The usual bartenders that we have are always on the ball to the customers. Yes I know that's their job but ive been to places where those were things you dreamed off."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning  I was there with my family yesterday and got the grilled salmon. That was the only meal I ate all day. Aside from the salmon being super salty, I had this uncomfortable, unsettled feeling all day. Went home, took down the Christmas lights to keep active thinking I might feel better. NOPE. I had developed a headache, took Exedrin,  and then finally tried Pepto. I have not thrown-up in a long time but last night's experience made up for it. That is still very fresh in my mind right now. Even though the server was nice, I can't get over my horrible day after eating there. And since that was the only food I ate yesterday, I am pretty confident in leaving this review. I felt instantly better after I threw up."}
{"text":"I love that every year there are new games added! Some are geared towards older kids or adults and others are more for those little kiddos who are familiar with an iPhone or android game."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time and last time I will ever eat at Dave and Busters. A group of 4 of us thought we would try the Fives all around appetizers and the Hawg-a-saurus cheese fries due it being the first time going to Dave and Busters. The Fives all around appetizers were terrible it all tasted the same, it was like they cooked the pretzel dog and pull apart pizza and the quesadilla and the same greasy add grill cause it all tasted the same the chicken wings were cold and tasted like the other crap, the only thing was good on that dish was the tater tots... who can mess them up... now to the hawg fries, it was supposed to come with pulled pork, but we couldn't even tell what kind of meat it was, it was terrible...  The service was TERRIBLE  aslo it took over a half hour to get service and then it took over a hour to get our food, once we got our food they only check on us once the whole time we where there eating our food.   We will never go back to Dave and Busters again.... This place is definitely off our list!!! And don't know how this place stays in business!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. the first time i let the bad service slip. second time, i went on my birthday and got horrible service again.I sat at the bar area both times. waited forever for service. There is a huge group of workers who hang around and don't help at all. A new manager is needed or a whole new staff. Worst service here. Wont be here again."}
{"text":"I like the fact that you can GAMBLE at this place.  I mean, who DOESN'T want to gamble with their points to earn tickets to get that piece of candy in the shop for 55 million tickets???  I say that sarcastically, but it's actually pretty fun.  I like the trivia, I like the bar downstairs, I like the bar upstairs, I like the bowling alley... what I love is that you can drink while playing arcade games.  It's just a blast."}
{"text":"I love playing their games and foods are not bad at all! It does take some time for it to come out tho..  but still decent~good for an arcade place.   Philly cheese steak sandwich - so yumz! Kind of oily but was definitely a good choice. 4 Cocktails are well made too. 4 Deep fried shrimp - was much larger portion than expected, is good to share with 2-3 ppl. 3"}
{"text":"Be prepared to feel like a kid again, but surrounded by drunken adults or crazy ticket collecting people.   When we got there on a Saturday night at 10pm it felt like we were entering a large sports bar. Granted, there was a fight going on, and people apparently like to come here to watch it, while occasionally sprawled on some games that people would want to play.   We lined up and showed our id (20+ only). Coat check is $1.00.  To play the games you need a powercard or D&B Membership rewards (which keeps track of how much you've spent, and you can get discounts eventually if you spent 1200 credits).   Tip: go to their website and sign up for $10 powercard. it's free money!  All I remember about the pay scale was $25 for 150 credits. Add  $3 for 20 more credits. We got the 4 pack which meant $25 for 170 credits, as long as each person buys $25. Essentially you're saving $3 each.   Each game ranges from 3.5 to 7 credits on average. Some are 11.   For the whole night I used 100 credits and had 100 left over.   So you have your video games and then you have your ticket producing games. Indulge your self, but like in gambling know when you stop.   You can redeem your tickets at the shop at the back.  They measure your tickets by weight, and the guy who works there needs to be nicer.   The store seems to be full of things no one really wants, or old stuffed toys. I did get something decent here once, a glass board game (chess, backgammon, checkers) set.  I would suggest if you see nothing here, save your tickets and come back another time.  And don't be surprised if by the end of the night, the store looks like it got robbed. I don't think anyone cleans up the place.   We had a lot of fun despite the huge crowds."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I can't believe we just spent almost $300 in this place. First off we had no clue that getting a card first would benefit us. So we bought cocktails and got on the waiting list for a table for dinner. Waited about an hour btw.. So we then proceed to the front and ask about the place since no one greeted us at the door and told us anything about the place. There was 4 of us adults and we were under the impression this was a fun place for ADULTS! Uh yeah NO. There were little kids running around and screaming everywhere like we were at one of those children pizza places and a bunch of teens being loud and obnoxious.  In the restaurant area we ordered a full rack of ribs, the calamari and totts with bacon and other toppings. The RIBS WERE AWFUL and overcooked! THAT CALAMARI WAS THE WORSE I've ever had, dry and overcooked and hardly any on the plate, they substituted some of the calamari rings with banana pepper rings. Just awful!  My friends ordered the philly sandwich and a Salad (I think the lawnmower) which was ok. We treated our friends and it was a waste of our money! Geez!  Ok now those games. Wow, what a selection......its way smaller there then I had imagined. Kids were bumping and running into us, we couldn't even play a game without a line of people behind us or someone bumping us. This place is just down right awful!  It blows that I still have a lot of \"chips\" on my card because we only played 3 games! But I will give it to some kid to use because no one in my party enjoyed this place and we will not return! Do not waste your time or money here if you're looking for good food or an adult night out!"}
{"text":"Best philly ive had so far! So delicious! We will be returning! Drinks were mixed well and they were not shady with the liquor!"}
{"text":"The one thing I love about D&B is that at a certain time in the evening its an all adult affair. No coins at all you have your own personal card to apply money on so you just slide & go. The food is ok it just depends on who the cook is once you arrive. Catfish or Burgers & fries you can't go wrong with that. I always get that. The games are ok enough. I give it four stars."}
{"text":"We love visiting this place.  My children would play games here for the entire day if we would allow it.  Friendly staff has always been helpful and we look forward to going again sometime soon."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Our server was a little absent-minded. I met my two sisters and one of their boyfriends and we ate dinner and the played some games. The games part was fun, but at dinner, the waiter split the check in two.. as if I were there with my sister as a date. He just assumed we were together, which is not cool. Food was good. I'll be back for the games, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Haven't been to one of these in a long time. It's good to play like a kid again.  Good staff, very clean place, very spacious.  Good for large groups. We had about 350 people there.   Catered food was pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"Went to Dave & Busters tonight and had a great time. We started with the appetizer (which was huge!), then ordered the nachos and a dessert. The dessert was a brownie sunday which was so tall it was held upright with a shish kabob stick. Everything tasted great but its definitely not the kind of place you go if you are looking for healthy options, you are going to eat a lot of calories with the food available here. We didn't end up playing any of the games but the arcade section was pretty full and it looked like everyone was having a good time."}
{"text":"Dave and Buster's is a cool place.  I had the sliders. (good) 2 cocktails (okay) The staff (awesome)  The games I didn't play.  I tried to buy tokens or cards or whatever you get, but I didn't want to pay $25 dollars for the cheapest credit.  I just wanted to play the jump rope game.  Geeze man.  One game, that's all I wanted to play.  There must be another way.  I will return when I have $25 dollars to throw away on arcade games."}
{"text":"The food was all very good, as per usual.  We opted for the slider app basket and the sliders were so good we got the slider meal as well.. The selection of games available are always changing and there's always something new and awesome to play that wasn't there the last time you were. The problem lies within the machines and/or credit network itself. We lost a countless amount of credits Saturday on machines that would deduct from the card but fail to deliver the game play we paid for.  Try to play a 2 player game together: one player may receive their game credits and the other was left standing there like an idiot. Not good DNB, not good. Handfuls of employees walking by with no solutions. May be quite a while before we attempt to come back, can't see the point in \"buy 20 get 20\" deals when you take back the \"free\" 20 in credits. Is this a scheme ran by DNB, or simply a case of half the machines being inoperable?"}
{"text":"Played some games, had a beer and got the fish n chips.  The machines kind of had an affinity for stealing my credits but I didn't want to spend my night trying to chase an employee down to try and get them added back.  One of the games said I should have won 200 tickets but it never credited them.  Again, I didn't want to expend the energy to get enough coupons for a pack of candy.  Fish and chips was good.  I didn't actually expect homemade potato chips - but I didn't like them.  I was told afterwards the menu said it was served with chips so that's totally my fault for not looking.  I would recommend substituting fries or tator tots.    But on the bright side, it's a fun place - plenty of space to watch sports and play games with the family.  Had a great time."}
{"text":"Fantastic time!  Way better then going chucky cheese for the games. Food wasn't bad either. Will return for sure"}
{"text":"the mountain of nachos! it's gargantuan! cheese, meat, guacamole, sour cream, black bean, tomato, pickled jalapenos and tortilla chips for days! come watch #ufc! grab a #vegasstrong alcoholic beverages! there are televisions everywhere! there's gaming! there's fun! promos and offers get on the email list!        the place was packed and we got served in less than a half hour! staff is friendly! they got happy hours! bargains!"}
{"text":"Service was ok, food is good.  The games are great and the biggest reason we go.  Wednesday is the day to go as games are half price."}
{"text":"Any stars given is solely for our server who did everything he could to give us great service. But his great service unfortunately doesn't make up for the terrible food or the fact that 4 out of 5 us were practically finished eating before the 5th person in our party received his simple order of mac n cheese. And lighting sucks."}
{"text":"Great food, but the gaming experience was not the same. Many games just ate the points up off our cards and read \"Game over\" before we could even begin playing. With most of the games costing at least a dollar, this can get annoying fairly quickly. The staff didn't seem too phased by this issue, nor too eager to resolve it."}
{"text":"A blonde short haired female security was extremely rude as to not accommodate to my girlfriend and I who are both 18. They could have been much nicer given that only one of us had an ID. It is inconvenient how Dave and busters does not except 18 year Olds yet have a huge arcade. We should be allowed to utilize the arcade at the least. It's not like we are going to get drunk at the bar or even be permitted to do so before being carded.It's ridiculous and embarrassing for the establishment to have hired individuals who lack manners and sincerity."}
{"text":"Poor bar service, 4 bartenders and not one could offer us a drink until 15 minutes after waiting and then we still didn't get any service , so we finally walked away.. ridiculous.  Then the price of the games are way over priced.. you don't see the actual price of games because you pay for it in a card.  Not worth it.  Total chaos there, no organization,half the games are broke."}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE! Every aspect of the location, our server was horrendous and we were the only table in her section, took 20 minutes to bring us drinks. Then when we got our food it was all uncooked and/or cold! Fries were still soggy and uncooked and freezing cold. Philly cheesesteaks still cold in the center. And I don't mean \"just not hot\", it was all as a cold as though it was just taken out of refridgerator. Like chilled. Everything was disgusting. Onion rings not cooked either. Waitress was less than willing to do her job.   Then the bar in the game area, the bartenders had no sense of urgency, took 15minutes to receive two bottles of bud light ( at an empty bar)   Was extremely disappointed, hoping it was just this location. Because I have never had this experience else where."}
{"text":"Had fun playing games and drinking here! Lots of games and prizes. Great atmosphere including a DJ!  On a side note, some creepy middle aged man came up to me and my wife asking if he gets us a certain amount of tickets on a game (which we had to pay for) then we buy him an alcoholic beverage. What in the world is wrong with this man?!?! Couldn't find any management workers to advise so we just walked away and avoided him for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Everything was going pretty smooth so far as we got there. If was our first time so we didn't know how it worked but the doorman explained it to us a little, unlike the girls at the front desk who just kept giggling and gossiping and not even bat an eye in our direction. We had a had  time trying to figure out the whole coin buying thing and when we went back around to ask the girls at the front they just told us there was machines in the back and to buy them there. OKAY. After that we pretty good time and got a good amount of tickets, but not enough for what my baby sister wanted, we were just about 50 short so I asked the girl at the ticket stand if we could buy tickets, pretty sure her name was Arielle and she just looked at us like we were stupid and rolled her eyes. I didn't know how it worked since it was our first time, just wanted some help and she just gave us a dirty look. She probably ruined the night for us and we left right after."}
{"text":"Second day it's open and things are already great! Lots of fun games and tasty cocktails too!! Drake was a great bartender and made a delicious recommendation with the Strawberry Watermelon Margherita! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came to this Dave & Busters location yesterday night to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and was unpleasantly surprised. It was the most disorganized establishment I've ever been to! Considering the holiday and the grandeous size of the eatery you'd expect more than just a few staff working. It took 30-40 minutes after the waitress had taken our drink orders to receive our drinks and then after that another 30 minutes for her to come over and check on our table so we could order our mains. The food took around an hour to an hour and a half to arrive and about 90% of our table had received their food, except for 3 people, including myself. The waitress did not even check on our table and we had to flag her down to ask her about the whereabouts of our meals... she seemed shocked and went to the kitchen. The burger I ordered was disgusting!!!!!! It looked nothing like the one pictured on the menu, was dry and burnt and just all around disgusting! I couldn't believe what I received?? My sisters burger was also fully burnt and rubbery and the other person who had been waiting for their meal decided to cancel their order altogether after being initially served the wrong dish and then being served the correct dish except it being ice cold and just unappetizing! I couldn't believe after waiting more than an hour for our food they would serve us something of this caliber. After my mom addressed the state of the burgers with the waitress she apologized and decided to offer us drinks as an act of compensation. Now I've worked in the service industry before and this is not the way in which situations such as this are dealt with... It was just completely unprofessional! Of course my sister and I did not finish our meals. Also to mention, throughout the entire course of the dinner the waitress did not clear any of our dishes. From the moment we left the remnants of our dinner were left on our table! Cups on cups and dishes on dishes! The mixture of smells at the table was nauseating! Minutes after getting home I was met with an unquenchable thirst. I drank and drank and drank water! I could not quench my thirst. I immediately began to feel bloated and was sick for the rest of the night till the morning! I believe I had food poisoning because of the way in which the meat was cooked! I WILL NEVER COME TO THIS CHAIN OR ANY OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS AGAIN! It's a complete money grab, over priced food that is cold, disgustingly made and will make you sick! I could not believe that in this day and age something like this exists! Do not waste your money! Go somewhere good and the majority of horrible Yelp reviews will back up my equally horrible experience! Not satisfied in the least!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Like chicly cheese for adults! Super cool concept. Food was good as well. Overall 5 stars"}
{"text":"Tried to love it bit wayyy too many kids for an adult location. Isn't Dave and Busters supposed to be the adult arcade?"}
{"text":"Very entertaining for kids and adults. They also serve alcohol beverages, have tons of games to play and you can collect tickets to redeem a prize at the end."}
{"text":"So where do I begin? First let me say this Dave and Busters is really small compared to the other locations in Arizona...so me and my friends went in to get drinks and food on Friday night we ordered the tower beer 100 oz and the beer tasted watered down second the price on the food didn't match the quantity u get I ordered a 9.99 chicken quesadilla and got 5 mini slider looking quesadilla...our server Alex was a complete fuck up and he doesn't care about his job..he screwed up our order and the order of the people behind us...the people who brought out our food confirmed that when they had made a comment \"That dude (Alex) always fucks up, and now we're going to get blamed for it!\" Nice job Alex! He works in the bar area so maybe try and avoid that area altogether...seems I'm not the only one who has complained about this lazy POS ...next time I'll drive the extra 15 miles and go to the other Dave and Busters...Westgate Sucks!!"}
{"text":"We had fun here and won awesome prizes for our little girl! The manager was awesome! Very up beat and got us cards set up and had a very good attitude and personality! I believe his name was Sam!   I gave this D&B 3 stars because although the manager was awesome and the games were fun, our waitress was not personable at all. She barely took our order. We got the triple play, she didn't ask what we wanted on that or about our wings at all. She also took forever and I don't think she smiled one time. The boneless wings were all bread and about the size of a quarter. They were awful.   The front desk lady or hostess, was not nice at all. She had the worst attitude for someone to be working at the front desk of what's supposed to be a fun and happy place! Hopefully it was just an off day for them and they bounce back because acting like that will not allow this business to go far...'"}
{"text":"Sent my daughter here with a friend yesterday , it was so hot she was dripping sweat . To me that kinda sucks I sent her there to get our of heat! With 200$ not ok with this I just don't think we will be coming to his establishment anymore."}
{"text":"One of the worst places to go if you expect good customer service and an actual meal. My girlfriend and I received some of the worst customer service we have ever had. First the waitress brought me the wrong beer and proceeded to argue with me saying that it wasn't the wrong one. Then we waited for over an hour for our food. The whole time our waitress stopped by and asked if we were ok twice. She never offered a reason to why it was taking so long. After her stopping by to ask if we needed anything else, we told her we never even received our food. She went back and said that they were still making it. We had to flag her down to tell her that we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. She then took more of our time to get the check processed. We still ended up paying for our drinks and the floor leader never once stopped by to apologize for the wait. She \"comped\" us with game cards for the video games. We turned those in to the front desk and the girl at the front was no better. When we said we were not coming back because of the terrible service she just said ok. I'd say save your money and go to a location that actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"I came here with few friends for a show by Bobby Motta (mentalist) and Bill Abbott (magician). Show was $20 per person and they threw in free play cards (play all arcade games for free) and a buy $20 get $20 credit coupon for free. An awesome deal if you ask me.  Bobby started off with simple mentalist tricks then moved on to do the infamous phantom touch trick. Bill's tricks were cool but keep in mind that seats were preassigned and that he hand picked all his \"volunteers\" which makes it obvious that he was using stooges (with the exception of few actual volunteers). Both were fun entertainers but they were surely over hyped. Still it was worth the money.  Afterwards we went to the arcades and took advantage of our free play cards. Mario kart was the best hands down. Games ranged from arcade classics to virtual reality simulations. We also used our credit coupons to play non arcade games that gives out tickets. Overall it was a great night."}
{"text":"A great place to kill time if you're waiting for Gen that opened up nearby. I feel like the whole bar staff knows to make their drinks super stiff because I've never had a mixed drink that didn't surprise me. The prices aren't crazy expensive but again the drinks make up for it. They have like a salsa night upstairs on Wednesdays which I don't really attend but on occasion I've gone up to check it up and looks fun. Its located at Tempe marketplace so depending on the day parking can either be a breeze or a nightmare."}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun spoiling nieces here.  We played hard and won lots of tickets.     Great games.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Terrible customer service. Took about a cool 20 minutes for a server to come up to my table before getting asked what we want to order, and then getting told he won't be our server and doesn't know who will serve us. Although he was respectful and told us to not hesitate to ask anyone for help or questions. All the servers we saw gathered up in the corner and stayed chatting to themselves. The refill lemonade my husband got was way too watered down. It was quite annoying seeing servers and workers in general not doing they're job, considering this is the only Dave & Busters in Vegas  AND in Summerlin, you would think they'd have a great staff or at least meet the guests expectat.. Other than the service and food we had the games were fun & highly entertaining.... STEP YOUR GAME UP D&B PLEASE."}
{"text":"We went to Dave N Busters on a late Saturday afternoon to meet some people from out of town to watch some college football. Having been to other locations in California, I knew they had a large bar area with multiple TVs to watch different games going on that afternoon. While DNB's did have a lovely bar scene with lots of TVs and action going on, their service left something to be desired.  Once getting a seat right away in the bar area, we were greeted by the first waitress. In all fairness, she did state that they were in the middle of a shift change and another waitress would probably be helping us towards the end of our meal. The first waitress was great, got our drinks quickly and when the rest of our party arrived, got theirs as well. We also ordered an appetizer (cheese and spinach dip)  with the first waitress that was delivered piping hot and quite fast.  The second waitress was another story. She took our dinner order with no pen or pad, which was concerning just because she asked us to repeat several times and recited our order back wrong to begin with. We ordered another round of drinks with our dinner order. Then.... Nothing! She must have gotten busy or overwhelmed, but a set of waiters tried to deliver our food and our guests got their food, but they didn't have ours (actually, we later found out she put another table's order under ours and it just so happened the first two items were the same as our guest ordered).  We still had not received our drinks and we had 2 beers and a margarita. She came to the table and started blaming the kitchen and the bar for being busy when other tables around us were fine. At this point we were still waiting over 30 minutes for the rest of our food and our drinks. A manager came and asked where our food was, when we told him we hadn't received it, he seemed upset and went to find out what happened. He kept asking if we ordered together or separate and we told him we ordered together. He brought out some of the food we ordered, but forgot our drinks and basket of chips we had ordered with our dinner (and at the same time). The waitress came back after with 2 of our beers and then made some excuse why we were still waiting for our maragarita. We literally waited yet another 10 minutes after all that time to get the margarita, which was delivered by someone else. A little bit after, our waitress came with another margarita and said they made an extra so he could have it. It was just really bad. Still no chips. We would have ordered at least another round and some more wings, which was the intention, but it was such a mess, we decided to leave at half time and go somewhere else. We still spent well over $150 for the 4 of us.  I understand this place is new, but the difference in service from the first to second waitress was night and day. With all the noise and commotion going on in this place, I'm sure it's hard to concentrate all the time. My suggestion would be to make sure the staff writes down their order and are tested on the menu and table numbers to avoid these types of situations. Also, there were quite a few managers that circled this place, but none were really touching the tables to make sure everything was ok. The one that did visit our table was only concerned with getting out one of the multiple items we were missing and never came and checked again.  It's also a true annoyance when a server blames everyone else but themselves to take responsibility for a mistake. Everyone gets behind, but when you're at our table being very unprofessional speaking about a bar that is obviously getting everyone else's drink out (we were right in front of the bar and multiple people were in and out of there while we waited and waited) and kitchen that is able to make every other table's food, maybe it's time to take responsibility and at least I would have more respect for your troubles."}
{"text":"Where to begin...  I went to Dave & Busters for the first time last night. The experience with the gaming side, fantastic, the gentleman at the front was very helpful. We had a great time playing the games. I had left my cell phone on a game and someone had turned it in and an employee was able to recover it quickly for me. I was very happy at this point.  We went to eat and that is where it went DOWN HILL. Our waitress, Jasmine, was the worst server (Jasmine) I've ever had at any restaurant, from Florida, to Iowa, California, Thailand and all over the world. This waitress (Jasmine) was incompetent of doing her job. Jasmine was slightly rude, but the biggest issues was she was dealing with the public, when I would only allow her to be a dish washer, or table busser.   Jasmine NEVER asked any one at our table if we wanted refills, checked on how the food was, or seemed to give a rats behind about anything.   I ordered a boneless hot wing meal with fries. Then Jasmine told me the happy hour specials which they had half off boneless wing appetizer. So i decided to order that way instead since it is cheaper. Jasmine didn't offer when I said I wanted boneless wings so that was irritating she wasn't trying to HELP.   I told Jasmine I wanted 2 orders, because it's a happy hour special and considered an appetizer, I wanted to get one early since I knew it would take 45 minuets to get the food. I would take the fries with the second order.   Jasmine brings the food, and I ask her about the fries, she first tells me she put them with the second order (which is what we talked about) then tells me she decided not to put the second order in yet because she got busy. Well so glad you decide to do what you would like with MY order. I asked her how long it would take for the second order, and she said 7 minuets (that would of been wrong) and I said don't worry about it. I was already irritated and not going to wait another 30 minuets. Jasmine ask if I still want the fries and I said sure, she said it would take 5 minuets. 20 minuets later I flag her down and tell her to not worry about the fries.  Jasmine then tells me the reason the fries didn't come out with the first order (we didn't order it that way I'm now thinking she's on drugs) because she ordered it with the second order.  WRONG, YOU ALREADY TOLD ME YOU DECIDED TO NOT PUT THE ORDER IN BECAUSE YOU WERE BUSY AND FORGOT. So now Jasmine lied to me and tried to blame someone else when she already admitted she did wrong.  Two of us ask for the bill, Jasmine brings his, not mine, takes his and brings it back and leaves. Finally brings my check to me. Charging me for 1 order of wings, and a order of fries. I give her my card and ask her to fix this.  Jasmine comes back 10 minuets later with the updated check (fries cost $1.88 and comps me $1.29) this makes no sense. I notice she didn't bring me a ticket to sign and put the total on.   I can't take it anymore, this girl was slow, incompetent, rude, and didn't give a crap that she was turning away first time customers of this place of business.  I see another waiter and ask for the manager. She comes over, I tell her the story, and she apologized and didn't charge me for the 1 order of happy wings I had, and I paid for the 1 beer (would of had more but the waitress never offered or asked). I told her I would be happy to tip a buss person as I am not cheap nor trying to get out of paying, but this girl would received a $0.00 tip. She said they tip out at the end of the night.  You are only as good as the people you work with.I offered to tip the busser, but the manager let me know the wait staff tips out. I paid my exact bill $6 and some change for the beer.   I will NEVER return to this place, my coworkers who were with me will not return as she was rude to them, and I hope this girl is not a waitress at any place I visit. If Jasmine is, I'll leave.  Unhappy customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this location about once a month this time we went to this location at 8pm on a Wednesday we completely understood it was half price game day so we expected a little bit of a crowd. We decided to eat first and play after. We sat in the \"open\" seating. It took me a few minutes to decide what to eat so we placed our order around 8:20pm at that time I also ordered one of their \"sea monster\" drinks honestly mostly because I wanted the monster. Our sever returned with the drink with out the monster and said sorry were out. Ok I understand it does say while supplies last but why wouldn't she come over first and let us know. Anyways I accepted the drink and took one sip and it was so watered down it tasted like water with a hint of mango.. Our server never came back to check on us to see how the drink was or to see if we needed refills on our other drinks 30 minutes later after being ignored my husband and I walked to the hostess stand and told her we were leaving. She said okay not to worry about the soda and she apologized. As we were walking out our server magically appeared and said the would cash us out for our drinks. She brought the bill and my husband informed her about the aweful drink and that we would not be paying for it being I took one sip out of it she said \" Well I'm not the bartender\". After we payed we left we will and we will not be back."}
{"text":"We came here with another couple and our kids with ages ranging from 4 to 7.  We had a great time!  The food could be better but it does the job for what it is intended to be.  It is mostly bar food and lots of colorful drinks.  With a full bar you can ask them to make something less sugary or stick to beer and wine.  We took turns eating and playing video games.  Nice entertainment option for a rainy day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love bringing our 7 year old here. She gets the biggest kick out of the games and spending time having fun.  And we love that the food is of a really high quality and e know she is going to eat something better than icky pizza or tired chicken nuggets.   Plus we like sitting and having a nice meal before we go running after her for an hour or so."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try it out and see about having my daughters birthday party there. The minimum was \"was\" $250 for 10-20 people, which I thought was perfect. I had no problem paying more if we went over, just because my daughter wanted to have it there. The food is okay at best and they are small portions for the money. Wait staff is constantly up selling the the power cards for the video games, which is annoying, (just get me another beer or refill on a soda). The video games are great, that is the only upside to this place. After about a 2 weeks of constant badgering with phone calls and emails to try book the party, we finally made contact. Key word is, \"we\" made contact. We spoke with a person by the name of Veronica, who said, the price is now $1,200! WTF? A $950 increase! I hope to get a response from management, they have yet to call me! #daveandbusters"}
{"text":"Food was alright, portions were perfect, service was nice. Overall good experience. The arcade atmosphere was wonderful I had pretty great time. Would probably come here again!"}
{"text":"Have been here for 45 minutes thus far and have only managed to get our drink order in. What's even more sad is that we were seated within the first 20 seconds of walking in and it's not even really busy. Food variety looks and sounds great, but not sure I'll be able to wait long enough to try any of it because even though it's 1:00, it's a Sunday and my kids will have to eventually go to bed for school in the morning. At this pace we'd be eating by 6:30 at the earliest. When I asked where our server is/was at the bar, I merely got a weird look and then finally an acknowledgment after a long, awkward hesitation"}
{"text":"We were there Sat night w/ kids had placed order & sent kids off to play while we watched football, after waiting way too long we were informed there was a computer glitch & our order & 40 others got erased- Here is why 5 stars- Trent Averhoff the manager did Everything he could to correct, & make us feel special! The direct tv even went down during all of it but he kept staff & customers happy! We will definitely be back! Thank you Trent for caring!!!"}
{"text":"I only gave 2 stars. 1 Star for the games and 1 Star for our server, who was great. This review is by no means a reflection on our server. She did the best she could with what she had to work with.  The food was terrible. $130 down the drain. I would have enjoyed taking the money out of my bank and setting it on fire more than attempting to eat that food. You can tell it's all very old and been sitting in the freezer a good long while. The salmon was so over cooked I couldn't even chew it. The rice and salmon were both over seasoned so much it brought a tear to my eye. The pizza pull apart bread was so oily one child refused to eat anymore after one bite. The burger was so tough the other kid was unable to bite through it. The bang bang pasta was ok. Just ok. Very greasy and later made my son's stomach hurt. The steak was so tough my husband gave up after a few bites, and it was medium and tough. They offered not to charge me for the pizza pull apart but wouldn't waive anything else.   Most of the games were fun and I'll take he kids back. Some of them are broken though or have trouble reading the cards. It's mostly about going slow and leaving the card in for a second before pulling it out.   One thing is for sure... I will never eat there again. Also most of the tables were filthy and filled with dirty dishes. It was difficult finding a place to sit down that wasn't absolutely gross."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the arcade here.  The games are a bit expensive, but they have a wide variety of games and prizes to choose from."}
{"text":"This is exactly what one should expect coming to a family game/sports venue. Loud, busy and a little pricey. We stared with the calamari...DELICIOUS!  I had the CALIFORNIA SMOKED TURKEY MELT. I could not have asked for  a better sandwich. It was fresh with a good grill on the bread. Kind of like Goldilocks: not too hard, not too soft but just right!  Son had the Caveman. He had enough for leftovers. Says the sauce on the ribs was perfectly spicy. Daughter had the Short Rib & Cheesy Mac Stack....another that had enough for leftovers.  I recommend the place highly unless you want quiet. Ain't gonna happen here."}
{"text":"I just wish the place was bigger but my son enjoys it here so I can't complain. They have a restaurant and bar so I can enjoy myself while my son is doing his thing."}
{"text":"We have had several business meetings and lunches here over the last three years and this D&B is very consistent in its excellent food and service. Rachelle, their event coordinator, is great to work with. They are very accommodating, we always leave with a great experience and that's why they are always among our top choices."}
{"text":"If you have coupons, get the points on your card and come back on Wednesdays for half price day. Then its a decent price. You can sign up for their email club to get coupons. The food however, is just outrageously expensive for what you get. The nachos and fondue tray are good and an okay price though so sometimes we get them as a snack, but mainly we eat dinner elsewhere. The staff is always really good at replacing points if a machine is broken. They have some pretty decent prizes. My daughter prefers here over Chuck E Cheese."}
{"text":"Got fish and chips  it was terrible. The fish is like rubber the breading was blackened in places and the fish had shrunken inside the breading so there was more than an inch of space on either end.  The games were decently fun but not worth the $50 we spent"}
{"text":"You want to know what? The food here was pretty good. There was six of us and everything we ordered went down without any complaints. We had the lunch deals that gave us a 20$ play card for what amounted to 4$ or so. Good deal but it doesn't last long. The arcade is an absolute money pit."}
{"text":"I have been twice and both times I have not been inside because the service is so bad I can't get past it. Going back a second time was hard to do to give them a second chance but I like to support downtown Summerlin but talk about disgusting dirty location and when I complain about having a clean place to sit they get upset, so I walk out"}
{"text":"How is this still in business? The service was not good. Not going to write servers name because I don't want her to get in trouble. Everything is over priced and misrepresented. I ordered a Grape Chill. It come out in a knockoff coke cup at full price! Plenty of other options."}
{"text":"You can't take the kid out of anyone - especially if you come here!!  What's better than an arcade? An arcade for adults with alcohol and food! There's not much to say, than that because it speaks for itself.   Grab a bunch of friends, drive up to Dave and Busters, play some games and have a few drinks! Never a dull moment here!"}
{"text":"This place is huge! It's massive in size and packed with tons of arcade games with a full bar & kitchen to keep the fun times rolling!  They staff was short when we were there.. And they were hard to find to order food/drinks when needed. But over al I was happy with the service."}
{"text":"I've gone to many Dave & Buster's in california and fell in love with the business because of the fun atmosphere, the great drinks, and the games that they all carried... But I am sadly to say that this Dave & Buster's will need to do a lot of work with their management and service regarding their restaurant. Me and group of friends had arrived at DnB around 8:45 PM excited to check out the new Las Vegas location. Going into the bar we had ordered 10+ drinks from our bartender named Albert which took roughly about 20 to 30 minutes to get all of our drinks, but I totally understand that it was a busy day for them since it was their first \"half off games\" day, along with their drink and food happy hour. The drinks were great tasting and didn't feel like there was too much alcohol or too little alcohol in which I appreciate our bartenders service because he did try his best to accommodate to us and everyone else around us.   Now around I would say 9:30 PM, we were thinking about whether or not we should get a table to eat at their restaurant because one other friend had told us that there would be a 2 to 3 hour wait for a table. But instead we went ahead and gave it a try just because we were pretty hungry and see if anything changed. We were quoted that we would get a tablet at about 25 to 30 minutes in which we were cool about because it gave us some time to go play some games and hangout a little before getting sat and try their food... It took them an hour and a half to get us a table, in which we had to check in with the host stand a couple times before getting a definite answer on what was going on.   Now going into dinner our server greeted us with a welcoming greeting and offered us to take our appetizer order and drink order. Luckily we had made it during their appetizer happy hour. Upon taking our appetizer order our server had taken our drink order also. We asked for a beer tower and a few cocktails that we really liked from when we had ordered from the bar when we first came in along with a few other cocktails we wanted to try. Our server had asked for our ID's in which we all handed our drivers license to her. Now all of my friends that had shown their ID's were clearly over the age of 21 especially me. She then had told us that she would have to have her manager check our Drivers license to her. Now in Nevada, if you had acquired your drivers license before the age of 18 you would have a vertical license. On the day you turn 21 is when you would have to renew your drivers license in which you would have to go in a few days early just before the expiration date so that you wouldn't be driving with an expired drivers license. There were 3 vertical license that we had given to her in which the manager themselves came out to our tablet and had to look at us, NOT THE PRINTED DRIVERS LICENSE DATE OF BIRTH ON OUR LICENSE, but just looked at us. After the servers manager gave her the \"okay\" to serve us alcohol. Upon returning our ID's our server was having a hard time figuring out which person was which in which she had almost given the wrong ID to the wrong person and made a remark in which I quote, \" You guys all look the same.\" Now as a customer I have never had anyone make that kind remark about me or my friends just because we are all Asian American in which i had found offensive because not one of us had looked alike what so ever.   Moving onto finishing up our meal and just enjoying everyone's company it was just about 12 o'clock and we had just gotten our checks, but we still had a few alcoholic drinks and had just about 20 more ounces of beer left in the beer tower we had ordered. A large man, who had dreads, wearing a purple shirt under a black sweater vest and glasses told us that they are now closed and that we had to go. In which I had found very rude and inconsiderate with the fact that we were still waiting on the checks with our credit cards in. What had also bothered me was that we were still finishing up our alcohol that we had ordered and the fact that there was another party in a separate room hanging out still and was not told whatsoever that they had to leave by my presumption because I was within view of that separate room perfectly fine. Now I understand that you guys are closed, but you DO NOT tell your paying customers to leave. If he had told us that before we even got our checks or anyone else in that matter, anyone could of just dine and dashed because they had told us to \"We are closed now, so I have to ask you to leave.\" We didn't even get to finish our alcohol because of him. By no means should a restaurant do that under any circumstances unless it is an emergency, which I believe there was no emergency at all.   Sorry D&B but you guys have a lot of work to do with your management team in the restaurant. I don't know how you can tell paying customers to get out just because you closed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by my experience tonight at D & B.  Started the evening with having an appetizer and two beverages.  The service was so slow that it took 2 1/2 hours.  We had to ask for silverware twice, napkins twice, and oranges three times for our tower of blue moon.  When we discussed our concerns with the manage, he introduced me to Avery at the front counter and told me he would take care of our party.  Avery NEVER did anything!! Horrible experience and I am not shocked that Dave and Busters in Summerlin has such a poor rating."}
{"text":"This place was truly built for all ages.  From the epic display of a plethora of TVs by the bar to the multiple basketball shooting bays, whatever your gaming vice is to blow off some steam D&B has it all.  The only thing missing is some e-gaming offerings but I'm not entirely sure I want to sit around and watch my kid play computer games in front of strangers when I can just give him his iBrainEater at home.  We come here about once a month to entertain and unwind for an hour or two and have the occasional bday party hosted here. Everyone always has a good time and an even better time when their are drink tickets involved. From date night to lazy Sunday this place is perfect."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but my husband and I like to come in a couples times a month to play games. The staff is over all pretty great, I haven't had any issues with service. The referee/game machine monitors are usually pretty quick to fix machines and issue tickets if the machines are out. The bar tenders are pretty friendly and I appreciate them not laughing when I order a Shirley Temple.   I try to avoid this place until after the mall closes, I get a little overwhelmed with kids running around but it's not too bad even then. They have a discounted game playing hour or two on Wednesday afternoon; but I've never made it in for the special, so I can't speak as to how crowded it is."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a friend of a friends birthday worst customer service ever they sat us down, then we waited 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders. Our waitress she had a attitude with us the whole night (I get it you might've had a shitty night) but why take it out on us. When she came back to get our orders she had only brought us 2 menus there was 6 of us at the table we asked her for more menus then processed to roll her eyes at us. Our food came to our table finally after a 20 minute wait  nobody liked there food, one of my friends his pasta he had ordered was cold  then proceed to talk to the manager. Don't bother eating here just come for the games honestly"}
{"text":"....Where do I even start???!!!  SUPER LOUD!!  I get it, games everywhere, lots of people...  Not really a complaint, just didn't expect the sound to be so amplified.  It was like being in a club on the strip type loud.  Food was ok, but a long wait..like 45mins+.  Again, I get it, big venue, plenty people, no prob.  Our server, \"Yaya\", I didn't get her real name, was very nice.  But didn't pay us too much attention after we finally received our food.  Never received refills on our drinks and she pretty much didn't come back til we needed our check.  And wow, that took awhile too.  Like 20mins+.  Now here's the kicker...  I came in on 9/3.  My meal was only supposed to be like $24 and some change.  My gf and I only ordered two things, the Short Rib cheesy mac stack ($12.99) and the Original Bar Burgers ($11+) and water (free,lol).  Ran my card, didn't leave a tip on the check, but left a cash tip on the table.  Fast forward to 9/8, I go to check my account, like I do EVERY WEEK and notice I have a charge from Dave & Busters for $55.55!!  I call them immediately and finally get in touch with someone in the back, Brianna.  I tell her the situation, she tries to find my original transaction, but can't come up with anything.  Instead of me holding she tells me she will call me back when she comes up with something.  I get a call about 15 mins later and says she spoke with her management and they are just going to refund the entire amount!  Awesome, even though I told her that's not necessary, she proceeds to tell me \"they told me $55.55 was really nothing and would be more trouble trying to find the actual receipt and doing a partial refund, so they just said refund the whole ticket\".  Again, I wasn't looking for a whole refund, just wanted them to fix it, but hey whatever they say.  So she takes my card number and says it should take a MAX of 10 days to see the refund and if I didn't see anything by the tenth day (which would have been 9/18) to call back.  Cool, solved.  Fast forward, again, to TODAY 9/23, here I am doing my weekly check up on my account...  NO REFUND IN SIGHT!!!  I call them immediately...  To my surprise, the person I need to speak with picks up the phone.  NOT Brianna, but the Senior Manager, TJ.  I tell him the situation, never received my refund, blah blah..  Again, he can't find ANYTHING!  No record of my original receipt or my card info for the refund that Brianna wrote down and was supposed to submit.  He then says to me, \"I will take care of this, just need your card info\"..  UMMMMM, NO!!  WTF?!!  Now my damn card info is just floating around in your back room somewhere??!!  He says \"maam, there are a lot of papers back here everywhere, I'm sure its back here, but I just didn't want you to wait on hold\"..  UMMMMM, NO, AGAIN!!!  I told him \"THATS MY CARD INFO!!!\"  \"YOU NEED TO FIND IT!!\"  After a few minutes of fumbling around he finds my card info, IT WAS NEVER SENT OFF!!  And of course I have to wait another 10 damn days!!  Now, it will be over a MONTH til' I get my refund!!  TJ was nice, but I just feel like the management and staff are lacking professionalism.  I mean seriously, read the most recent reviews on this place, its pretty scary.  And no representative from the company or this branch has responded to any comments.  Servers short-changing checks, rude staff members, the list goes on and on.  Please be careful going here, I don't recommend it at all.  I definitely WON'T be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, waitresses are impatient when we asked where our food is. We have been waiting for over an hour. This is so ridiculous."}
{"text":"Slow service even during the week and they don't have many dishes that don't involve meat but the games are fun and there is a full bar."}
{"text":"Wow, what a horrible experience.   I went with my boyfriend and our two siblings on March 25th, 2018 and we were very disappointed.   As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Jacob who rudely asked \"what do you want\" as we were browsing the token menu. I was shocked at the attitude, but it got even worse when I asked if it was possible to split the tokens between two cards and the response was, \"under no circumstances\". I was with my eight year old little sister, I feel like individuals with such attitude should not be working in an environment where children come to play arcade games.   I decided to talk to a Manager, because I was still stunned by this Jacob individual and the manager said he understood and would have a talk with him. I hope he did."}
{"text":"FINALLY... Dave and busters has come back to... Las Vegassss (in The Rock's voice)  During the first week of operations in their first store in Nevada, I went twice and was pleased with both experienced.   The games: the selection of games is similar to what you would expect in any major arcade. Basketball hoops, racing games, old school arcade games, just all that you would hope. There is about 100 total different games and the prices are fair. On Wednesday (half price games) me and my pops spent an hour and half there for $14 each. On Thursday for $12 I was there for about 1 hour.   Customer service: I was quite surprised with how many employees were here both days. I am not sure if this was just for the first week or if this is for the future, but since they were staffed very well the customer service was great.   It's a fun place and I am happy they are in my town."}
{"text":"A fun place to have food, drinks and play games!  Also there are TV's everywhere so if you are looking for a game to watch, chances are they have it playing.  Be sure to visit on Wednesday's at it is half price games!"}
{"text":"Customer service  sucks , we order food and a appetizers all at the same time it. It took 30 mins and the appetizers  showed  up the same time as our  food. Our drinks arrived right before  our food did . Service is horrible  we asked to speak to a manager  he never came  he just sent the waitress  over and said oh he'll just take the appetizers  off. The food is lackluster no seasoning nothing. Wont be coimg back here again. No one refilled our drinks. Never  again ."}
{"text":"The chicken and shrimp Mac and cheese was very good. I only wish it had more shrimp. The server was attentive and very helpful with the ordering process. The only down side was that it took several minutes for the food to come out and it was not all together but in batches. The arcade was fun and is better with a group. I will go again, and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Second time around was sooo much better! Came here for my friends birthday and service was awesome, we had a room rented out and the hostess for us was attentive and friendly. The food was great & games were so fun. Bartenders were friendly! The bathrooms were really clean too!  awesome second impression! Will be back again"}
{"text":"Soooooo... we brought my husband's 16 year-old son here for his birthday.  Though I'm a fan of fine dining I knew to expect bar food here.  The allure is the gaming and the multiple TVs showing sports.  We asked our son to invite a friend but he wanted to go stag.    What a fun place!  They are presently (05/2016) under construction and we were seated at a horseshoe-shaped booth that faced all of the TVs.  We ordered apps and our son ran to the arcade to play.  I found one of my favorite Merlots on the menu... hubby - beer, son - root beer.  We ordered normal bar-fare as appetizers and were surprised at the quality.  Our apps were amazing and our dinners were even better!  Pretzel Dogs (thanks fellow yelpers!), Calamari (crispy 'n spicy), bar burgers, wings, the Hottie Burger!  Need I go on?  I would like to interject that other than a few times when our son was drinking root beer or inhaling bites of dinner he was absent from the table (i.e. gaming in the other room).  He seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself (and my hubby and I snagged a little \"alone time\").    My husband - being a HUGE GALLAGA fan from the 1980s (who knew?) played several games and then dominated me when he suggested that I play against him.  My game of choice is Cross Bow so I was out of luck.  Skee Ball (total LOVE!), Air Hockey, Pac Man and Centipede rounded out my 1980s Atari/Arcade reverie.      Small children were waiting in line to play Skee Ball with their parents so I didn't partake.  We did watch our son play a Wii like football camp game before heading 30 miles south to our home.  It was a nice day, a great experience and a good meal!"}
{"text":"They've recently renovated and they look new and awesome. But... The food quality is pretty bad if you're getting anything other than a burger, nachos, or chicken fingers. To be fair, we didn't necessarily expect D&B's to have amazing sirloin but we definitely expected better. Our server was absolutely amazing, however. If I was to rate her independently from the establishment, I'd give her a 5 star for so much patience and knowledge. But unfortunately I'm rating the entire establishment, and I give it 2/5 in terms of dining experience. I believe if you come just for the bar or just for the midway for kids it's a lot of fun. They got many new games and they're all very new, shiny, and fun. But the winners circle (pictured) looks like it got robbed! There are empty shelves everywhere and everything seems overpriced in terms of ticket value. My nephews have to play hundreds of games and win thousands of tickets just to get a glowing mood light that I can find at the dollar store, and if you don't have that many you are forced to settle on hoarding a bunch of candies and stuff for 10-25 tickets each. This place USED TO BE awesome! But their quality level has dropped drastically and they must tighten their belt if they want people to start coming back."}
{"text":"First impression: understaffed and slow. I came in looking for an explanation of what I should be buying for my group of 4, and the lady staffing the front desk, as she was busy with another customer, said something about if we wanted to eat and play to go sit down in the restaurant. So we waited for a while to be seated, and when that did occur, we were escorted through a wasteland of tables covered in dirty dishes.  The food is fair if you're only expecting bar food, the service reasonable, the drinks have a wide variety to choose from.  After ordering said snacks, I purchased a 4-pack of \"power cards\", received a survey request on my receipt, which, as it turns out is impossible to complete, as it asks for a 15 digit code, and only a 17 digit code is on the receipt. This wouldn't have bothered me that much, except that when I wanted some help figuring it out, nobody had any clue what to do. A pity, since the reward for completing the survey would have inspired me to spend more money. Your loss Dave (and/or Buster).  The biggest surprise was that while nobody was interested in telling us what the food specials and gaming offers were for today, they did have great signs telling us all about them - IN THE BATHROOM. Seriously people, at least tell me to go to the bathroom for the low-down!  The machines are mostly in good repair, except for a few of the ticket generating ones, that did not issue tickets as promised. Overall, we had a pretty good time, but I'll be comparing my experience to the Dave & Busters in Livonia, MI to see if this is an isolated incident or endemic to the franchise."}
{"text":"I went to Dave and Busters for my birthday and had a great time! The bartenders were attentive and efficient- servers and managers were friendly. The layout of the place keeps it from being congested when busy. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because there were a lot of machines that were broken throughout the night.  They have also removed the button where you can call an attendant to the game you're at, so if there is an issue, you have to go find them yourself.  With that being said,  there weren't attendants walking the game floor looking to help people so you had to go find a server to call someone to the game."}
{"text":"Very attentive with my kids nut allergy...bonus 1 Star just for that.   Food...basically, no different than any other franchised burger joint...nothing special but lots of it.  Power credits were hard to follow...6.2 ... 6.8...  why not just 1 credit for 1 game for $1."}
{"text":"Food is god awful. We ordered burgers thinking we couldn't go wrong ... the meat was so weird it had to be fake.  Everything was so salty and acidic. The manager and server were nice but the quality of the food is below what it should be even considering it's save and busters"}
{"text":"Fell asleep last night before I got a chance to do my review this place is pretty cool it's just an arcade with a bunch of games they have a bar & u can order food as well the prizes have gotten better however there a few games that weren't working"}
{"text":"We got the triple play. It was enough for two. The tots were yummy. I also got the watermelon sno come which was delicious as well. Good service."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night for a get together for the Hubby's work place. Place was pretty packed but his coworkers were already there with a table. Got some mai tais to start. I was hoping this place was something like the Hawaii location because I used to be there all the time.  I thought Vegas would be bigger and better, but it's pretty small. Anyway, food was pretty good and pretty pricey. Maybe I'll check them out on Wednesday when drinks are 1/2 off."}
{"text":"We ate nachos, Caesar salad and the mini burger app and the food was good but the service was not very good. We did not get greeted by the 5 people at the entrance or the 3 hosts at the host stand, they were all too busy with phones and conversation for the guests.  No one on the staff at Dave and busters from food to bar to games cares enough to talk or help any of the guests. Management needs to fix this problem."}
{"text":"I've loved coming here since it first opened as part of the Waterfront shopping development, and I'm always up for a game of skee-ball!  The Pittsburgh D&B location is recently remodeled, so if you haven't been there in a while, do yourself a favor and check it out.  They've expanded the dining areas and added new, modern furniture, there are more TVs than you can shake a stick at, a menu with something for everyone, and of course... games!  They also recently opened a new show in their theater room -- Pittsburgh magician Lee Terbosic will be performing 2 shows every Friday and Saturday night.  You can even order drinks and food off the menu while you take in the show!  I went to the opening show this past Friday night, and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a \"sno-cone\" (hint: this drink isn't one for the kiddos!) to wash it down with.  Both were great -- the sno-cone flavors were just like an ICEE I would get on a childhood shopping trip with mom and dad, but with that added kick of booze.  Hey, I'm not one to complain.  Speaking of added kicks, the quesadilla has jalapenos in it, which I loved!! I love spicy foods and most places just serve a little cup of jalapenos on the side.  These were actually cooked into the fillings and I loved every bite.  The show itself was highly entertaining and the crowd seemed to agree -- Lee kept everyone on their toes for the entire 60 minutes.  I can't wait to check out more shows here and flex my skee-ball arm!"}
{"text":"This review is for the arcade portion only which I think 5 stars is in order because of the quantity and quality of the games. They have just about everything you can imagine including 21st century versions of classic 20th century games. For example giant Pac Man and a large modern version of Galaga, one of my all time favorites.  This place is extremely loud!  Sensory overload on the eardrums. With all the chatter of the patrons as well as all the sounds of the video machines the decibel level can compare to a concert venue.  We did not get to eat because we werr quoted a nearly 2 hour wait to get a table. I DON'T THINK SO! We made the reservation anyways but went somewhere else in DT Summerlin instead.  Our buzzer went off after about 45 minutes because I am sure everyone else said screw this wait. I did browse the menu and vegetarians beware there is not much for you to enjoy besides salad minus the meat or portobello mushroom burgers. The prices also seemed very $$ to $$$.   We had fun overall but the place was at capacity for a Friday night and at times a line for some games. With that amount of people I could see trouble brewing here very easily. This place needs some real security staff to make sure these problems don't arise and if they do, can be handled quickly.    Ahh my ears feel better now that it's quiet."}
{"text":"You don't come here for delicious food. You come here to play games. We have few venues in the GTA like this and thus it deserves a four star based on the fact that it is a midway/arcade/game zone that we lack.  Food isn't terrible here, service is ok, a bit absent minded and didn't come back after a long time to check if we were ready to order again after we told him we needed \"just one more minute\" to look at the menu.  They have good deals for game and food, a whole list of menu choices that you can pair with a $20 card (gives you around 220 points which you can supercharge for an additional $3).  This is a nostalgic place for me. Used to come here often to celebrate birthdays etc.  Lots of TVs from the gaming zone to the bar area so often DnB is very packed during any UFC and NBA/NHL/sports games.  They haven't done good upkeeping on the prize area, as when we went this past weekend, it was almost empty and sad looking. 600 points for a small bag of candy...? That's ok. You don't come here for the poor prizes. You came here for the satisfaction of winning those 1000 points on the spin a wheel!  Tip: After 10PM on Fridays/Saturdays, they check your IDs, if you don't have one then you will not be let in even if you were never planning to drink."}
{"text":"Service good but food lacked quality and presentation.  The pasta and beef was topped with fried spinach and not sautéed.  This was a waste of time.  The salmon was ok, but lacked flavor.  The jalapeño rice was too spicy  Thanks to the manage it was complimentary, but still won't be back."}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte for fun, food and games. And only 4 minutes from home. Not an inexpensive outing by any means, but you only live once.   Before 5 has better deals on food,  you can buy game credits and get a better price on your meal. I usually stick with Goldfingers (chicken fingers) , unless i'm feeling adventuresome. We don't drink, so I can't comment on the bar.   Plenty of TV's with sports on, if you're into that. I'm not. The games are fun if you're into that. I'm not. I watch my kid having a blast, and keep the card charged with enough credits to keep her playing. That's what it's all about for me."}
{"text":"I just came home from Dave and Busters in Glendale and I am really not happy and I want to share my experience.  We went there to celebrate my 9 year old nephew's birthday and there were 4 adults and 3 kids. We arrived at 3:30pm and were told we had to wait 45 mins for a table. This was a little surprising since we got there at such an odd hour, but it was fine. We used that time to play games on the floor.   This place is LOUD! My aspie son was overwhelmed a bit with the noise and the lights, so it might be something to consider when taking a child who has difficulties. Even the dining area is loud, so if you are planning to have an intimate conversation with someone, this is not the place.  When we were finally seated an hour later, we were greeted by the waitress right away. She took our drink and food order and everything was fine. But that's when things went south.  First off, I noticed that the table was a little sticky. I got something on my hand and had to wash up right away. But I figured once the plates arrived, it would cover up the stick, so I just let it go.  But then, it took at least 20 mins to get our food. I ordered the sirloin medium, and the second I tried to cut into it, I knew I was in trouble. I could barely cut the steak. It was so full of gristle! And it came with a side of loaded mashed potatoes. They were tasty, but unfortunately they were cold. This was an $18 meal, so I expected it to be good. I managed to eat about half the steak, but the rest I just gave up on. It was so tough, it was not edible.   I really didn't want to send the meal back because I was worried that someone would spit in my food. I'm not saying they do that here, I'm just saying I try to avoid doing things like that just in case.   Hubby ordered the rib/wing platter. He said the ribs were so full of fat and the wings were supposed to be jumbo. They were definitely not jumbo - they were barely regular. He also got a bowl of chili and he said that it was so small, he is thankful he didn't order the cup. It was definitely not worth $6.   We were seated right next to the wait staff area. There were about 4 or 5 servers there the entire time, all appearing to be just standing around and yapping. My SIL had to ask for ranch dressing 3 times before she got it. The servers were obviously not that busy, so we don't understand why it was so difficult to get a side of dressing.    Then we ordered desert. Hubby and I ordered the chocolate fondue, and the rest of the family got the donut holes.   We asked for extra plates so we could all share. The waitress came back with a stack of plates and every single one of them was dirty. I mean there was actually slimy stuff on them! I went through all of them as I passed them out, but every single plate had something stuck on it. I wasn't sure if they grabbed the wrong stack! I was so disgusted and I just couldn't hide it. The waitress asked if everything was okay, and I told her that all of the plates were dirty. So she went into the kitchen to get us some new ones.   Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't fondue supposed to be hot or at least warm? The chocolate fondue came served on top of a ceramic warming tray that I assumed was supposed to have a candle in it. But alas there was no candle, and the fondue was cold and watery. I still liked it and my son ate almost the entire thing. Maybe that warming tray is just for decoration.  The donut holes were actually really good and the best thing about the entire meal. The chocolate served with the donut holes was thicker than the chocolate fondue.   After the food, we went and played some more games for about 20 more minutes. I noticed that as we were leaving that they were just beginning to clean our table. No wonder we had to wait so long to be seated!   So overall, if you are looking for a fun, noisy place to drink and play games, it's totally fits the bill. But we will never eat here again. For the price of the food, we expected much better."}
{"text":"We decided to check out the bottomless wings and play credit for $20 this weekend and were underwhelmed. The food took FOREVER (1 hour +) and my $5 app nachos were cold. My husband ordered the wings and thought they tasted pretty good. The restaurant area wasn't full so we're not sure what took so long.  It was nice to get in quickly with a large group, watch all the football games playing on a Sunday afternoon, and have play credit to get a bit competitive with friends upstairs. Honestly, I probably won't be back for food of any sort, but I'd come back for a games + drinks for a date night or with friends."}
{"text":"Dave and Buster need to hire better bartenders. We waited 20 for the bar tender to take our order... There should be three bartenders at the midway bar. He also never asked if we wanted to order food. Speed up the service or higher more people."}
{"text":"FOOD ONLY! It was terrible. Firstly our waitress took 15 minutes to get our drinks. There was 7 of us and we ordered a few different drinks. She disappeared for about half an hour. It was a Saturday night and it was dead. A different waitress came and took our order. She was really nice. Our food came, my wife got a steak salad and it looked like they left it under a heat lamp for an hour. The lettuce was soggy and wilted. Her steak was cold and salty as hell. I ordered a turkey blt burger. They brought me a different burger and I sent it back. They never apologized for it until the second waitress came and said sorry. When I did get it (about 15 minutes later) it was dry and tasteless. Our original waitress then came back and asked if there was anything else she can do? She gave us our bill. I paid cash $45 and gave her a 50. She gave me my change and I went straight to our second waitress and gave her ten dollars. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Rude hostess, actually said \"that's not my fault\" for the 30 minutes we wasted there trying to find a waiter. Yes, it certainly WAS your fault. You seated us in a filthy area of your abandoned restaurant and everyone I saw was either long since done or still waiting to see a server. Bad job of the management, servers, and waitstaff. Congrats Dave & Busted!  If only negative stars were an option..."}
{"text":"Fun place to go on a date! Wednesday nights have half priced games and after 10pm they have a decent happy hour for drinks. If you're a night owl this is the place to be on a Wednesday night for an all around good time for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"There was a waiter there that sucked at his job. Other than that it was pretty fun. The food is the usual chain restaurant taste."}
{"text":"We came here the day after it opened and only played in the arcade.  I know how restaurants need to get the kinks worked out when they first opened so we avoided it on purpose.  From the loading of cards, to employees on the floor, everyone was very pleasant.  This place has a lot of cool games and since this place is new, they all work perfectly.  I opted to get the tickets put on the players card instead of carrying around tickets.  There are cups placed around the arcade to hold your tickets which is nice.  The little redemption center was nice because they actually have a mix of cheap dollar store items, and current name brand stuff.  Prizes are way overpriced, but it is to be expected.  When we went, the lowest credit game was regular skee ball at 2.8 credits I believe, most were 8-9.9 credits from what we played.  I guess they do the decimal systems so you don't feel so bad blowing through your money. :) I wish this place was closer, but I will schlep my boys over here to have some fun. I can't give this place five stars due to cost, three kids at the arcade is expensive, yo!  Plenty of parking and pretty easy to find, two thumbs up from me!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate!       This place has gone down hill.  I went on a Sunday evening so I wouldn't expect the moderate crowd to cause this kind of chaos.  The tile floor near the entrance was slimy and greasy.    When I stand I don't expect my feet to slide out from under me!    Gross!    The service at this bar was ok (Bar was about 30% full) but at least we got service.         My date and I decided to play some games and grab some food.   The bar/table area near the games was trashed.   Most of the tables were empty but still dirty.   The servers clearly did not care to great us or help.   We decided to belly up and order another drink at this bar (Again about 35% full) and place our order there.     After about 10 minutes of being ignored by the bartender we gave our regards to the unfortunate soul sitting near us (Also waiting) and left without being served.         At this point we decided to grab a drink at the first bar and play a few games prior to leaving for food elsewhere.         After sharing our thoughts about the place we realized that both bathrooms were trashed and this place probably hasn't been really cleaned in months.         This used to be a pretty well run place.     Hopefully they get it together."}
{"text":"It's alright, nothing fancy, and I so wish the food looked like it was in the menu.  The drinks are good but a bit overpriced.  I've been here twice and the first time the chicken on my pasta was burnt and then I tried the pulled pork sandwich which did not have much taste.  The games are alright for a night out, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people complain about the food and the service... But hey... It is Dave & Buster's. This one meets the expectation of mediocore food and subpar service. It's an adult Chuck E. Cheese. Video games, skeeball and booze = a good time for all. I would personally pass on the food and suggest sticking to beer (they can't really mess that up).   Go for the games, pool, and bowling. Sign up for their emails for free game play coupons or go on Wednesdays for 1/2 priced games. They also kick all the kiddos out at 11pm on the weekends to turn it into an adults only place."}
{"text":"I would rather have a full sized cow slither up my anus than spend one ungodly second at this god forsaken place."}
{"text":"This place was overly packed. We went to eat at the restaurant and was told there was a 90 minute wait. We ventured to the bar area and eventually found a seat. Once we ordered we waited a long time for the food. I ordered a salad but my meal came out before the salad did. The waitress apologized and said sorry the kitchen is backed up. We started eating and I bit into something hard in my burger. It was a white piece of plastic in my food!  The manager was called over and he said this looks like the plastic clip that holds the burger buns, we will refund you for this meal and then walked away. No customer service skills whatsoever. The games are extremely expensive as well. Would not recommend this place. Game Works has much better customer service. Will not be visiting Dave and busters with my family again."}
{"text":"I read all the other reviews and I think the issue is that they were not prepared for all the customers that would show up in the first few weeks but I think it has gotten a lot better since they have had a few weeks to get up to speed.  I'm 33 and I never play video game, but I really loved the arcade.  They had some cool physical, carnival games that I had never seen before that were a lot of fun and different  from anything I had tried.  I got $20 in arcade credits plus a burger and fries for $28 plus tip.  The burger and fries were delicious so I thought it was a great deal.  I will definitely be going back.  One reviewer says she thought it was racist that her black friend got carded and she didn't.  When I went there it seemed like half the employees were black so I really don't think there is any systemic racism going on."}
{"text":"Saturday night and they're busy. I get it. But the food is bottom of the barrel garbage. Fish and chips... Let's just say I've had better at Swiss Chalet. Have to get your own refills. Nice."}
{"text":"The last few visits were disappointing in the dining room.  The FOOD qulity has deff dropped, over cooked, un-seasoned and cold!  The SERVICE has gotten to be terrible! very slow, and orders forgotten, drinks take FOREVER to arrive! and over priced- for the recent quality!!  The GAMES are always fun! but many are broken, and it takes them forever to send someone over to help you with either receiving your coins, or credits back. the rugs are always dirty and unvacuumed...   PRIZE ROOM: is a total joke! always looks like they've been robbed! and the selections when there  are any; are terrible!!! (kids are always disappointed!!!  PLEASE D&B GO BACK TO THE WAY YOU WERE, GOOD STAFF, GREAT FOOD, FUN GAMES AND PRIZES! THE KIDS MISS IT!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening. It was not too busy. There is some construction going on at the moment so some areas are blocked off.  Happy Hour was from 10 to close. Ordered mojitos. They were very good. Staff was very friendly. Kids had fun playing games. Always a good time and always the same thing at all D & B's we've been to."}
{"text":"Have to admit my expectations were quite low after reading some of the reviews on here, but we went anyway. Drove 2.5 hours just to have this experience, our fingers were crossed. From the beginning where we were immediately greeted and promptly informed where to go for dining, to quickly being approached by our awesome server. He made jokes with our kids, made menu recommendations and also explained how the games worked and got us our game cards. The menu was extensive and our food was absolutely delicious! We expected  stale tasteless bar food but this was far from it! Mmm my sirloin, shrimp and lobster pasta dish was one of the best things I've had in a long time. My kids loved their kids meals and they never say that. Our cards were loaded and we were ready to play! The games were awesome! Not too badly priced to where I felt there was no value. Felt we played a good long time without breaking the bank. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because menu prices are pretty high and it was pretty crowded, but that wouldn't stop me from a return visit!"}
{"text":"Awful awful. Spent 150.00SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged. Really. The only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took AMAZING care of us......"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the menu sucked & that's where I should have been walking out but instead I decided to and give them a shot. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan Pasta hoping it'll look somewhat as good as it did in the photo on the menu. Once again I was wrong. The pasta of course was good I didn't see anyway they could've messed that up as far as the sauce that was good it probably came from a jar but the chicken was so over cooked I needed a steak knife to cut into it. After signaling the waitress to ask if it should be this way she had a manager come over and speak to me. For one the waitress was basically just doing her job so I can't put all the blame on her but once the got that resolved and removed it from the bill I ordered dessert, the Bananas Foster Pie. It looked so good but before I ordered I asked if it contained nuts since I have an allergy. This was the waitress EXACT WORDS as well as the same manger that came out \"It's not made with nuts it's just the crumble we sprinkle on top and the truffle sauce other then that it's fine but I can't guarantee it wasn't in the same factory as nuts we're so I'll leave it up to you\" with that I agreed and proceeded with my order. After 2 bites I find A NUT I WAS TOLD IT WAS ONLY IN THE CRUMBLE! Waitress comes back and asked if I was okay, I said yes but there are actually nuts in this pie and I even picked it out to show her. She takes it away and gets the check. I see the pasta was removed yet I was charged for the pie so I wait for her to come back and ask why am I paying for what I didn't eat. Her exact words \"Legally since we told you it may contain nuts we have to charge you.\" I advised her y'all said it was in the same facility and may have been near nuts and only stated the sauce and top crumble contained nuts. Not the inside of the pie! She then said \"I can get some to come over and talk to you if you like.\" I said no thank you and paid and left. Never ever EVER again will I eat at such a CARELESS place such as here again! They say never judge a book by its cover but for Dave & Buster's it's excluded from that rule! I recommend before you order ask questions, then ask questions again and then go ask questions again. I can guarantee you'll end up with two to three different stories."}
{"text":"im a fan  I went to this one October 2014. I was in town for my favorite nfl team the colts steelers game. I went to the game and had fun in the city.  I went on half off Wednesday. I really had fun with the games. im a young man and I like old Nintendo games. I like all kinds of games. the skee ball game acted up.  I had fun  I will go back. not to this one because of the miles to far I will go to the ohio one.  im a fan"}
{"text":"WORST SERVER!!!! We had a party of 5, told the server, Sammie we were celebrating a birthday. Had to ask repeatedly for refills, food was good and tasted good, he never cleared not one dirty plate. Kept asking me if i was ready for the check, after the third time i said yes, where was i going to fill it out? table was covered in dirty dishes! reminded him of my husbands birthday and he said he would sing to him. what a joke. All he was worried about was his tip and turning the table. biggest waste of $120.  game selection was ok, wish the place was bigger. the ones in cali are better."}
{"text":"Worst food and dining experience ever! I got two eat & play meals - 8 oz steak & mashed potatoes and philly & fries - and two surf and turf kids meal. All our meals were served lukewarm. Steak was dry and mashed potatoes   had the taste and texture of under cooked potatoes; surf & turf burgers looked like they had been stepped on, fries were stale, and fried shrimp was super salty; and the philly, actually, wasn't too bad, but fries were stale. Service was very, very slow...it took an hour plus for our food to be served and took kust as long to et the bill! I was so ready to go play the games with the cards I paid for with my meal. Arcade had a decwnt selection of games, but environment was run down and had a musty smell. I definitely don't plan on ever going to D&Bs again."}
{"text":"Our family was happy to hear D&B was opening, since we just moved here from San Diego. We loved the one out there. Our daughter has the best time.   Sign up for there e mail newsletter to receive coupons and information on deals, from games to food."}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun playing all the games a really nice place to spend time with your family ."}
{"text":"My friend and I both had Friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on Thursday night. We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)  The games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing.   I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.  Drinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give one star. Dave & Busters has been ruining my plans and events for years. Whether if it's a waitress whose just not having a good day or a prejudice manager you name it. Horrible service, same arcade games and filthy dining room tables."}
{"text":"The experience is getting worse. It's as if Dave and Buster just gave up.   We arrived to catch the Raps and upon entering the bar and front lounge was silent. Our hostess informed us a regular group using the enclosed private functions requested to mute all volume. No compromise was made. Equality gaps exists at this location, beware.   So had to sit in the midway where service was slow and tables are not cleaned. Ate the spinach dip and the chips were stale."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon with my 10 year old, today he chose Dave and Busters. $23 sure doesn't go very far in an arcade anymore. Always a fun time with your kids here, had some snack during our visit. Quesadilla's and sliders, nothing to write home about, quick easy bar food."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few years, decided to give it a go this weekend for a friends birthday. When our food came, most of the plates looked like they'd been half eaten. The menus pictures looked amazing, then all these sad plates arrived. Not only were they half portions, most of the items came out cold.   The drinks also seemed light -they were really watered down.   We didn't play the games after the disappointing food and drink experience. Decided to head over to hit up some bowling instead.  This place is fine if you're looking to have some fun game playing with your kids -I wouldn't recommend adult events here."}
{"text":"First time coming and we deliberately came during the week as the crowds have been crazy at the mall on the weekend.  The place is big and bright. Several seating areas and I really liked the incorporation of local imagery in one of the dining areas. We sat near the games so we could watch the kids play video games. The booth was huge and the seats comfortable. What I really liked were the high walls which created privacy.   The menu is expansive but here is where I started taking off points. The menus were so sticky and nasty that they made a sound when you pulled them open. Gross and a bad sign in my book. If you can't keep the menus clean, what else is lacking some good old soap and water? Food choices were typical bar/grill food/ wings, burgers, mozzarella sticks, pizza apps, chicken fingers, fries....we orders the big sampler and the hubby and kids enjoyed themselves. I wasn't hungry so my order was a watermelon margarita which had frozen watermelon ice cubes and green sugar on the rim. It was yummy (not strong at all) and refreshing.   Best parts of the visit, service was on point. Our waitress (starts with a T, can't remember whole name) was awesome. We even told her about the loud sticky menus and she was on it. We also like the free play during the week from approximately 5 to 7pm. The kids had a ball playing without swiping until the food came and a little afterwards. We'll be back as this is so close to home and a great week night family dinner spot.  Weird moment: seeing a guy on the dance dance revolution like game for the entire time we were there. Dude had a sweat towel wrapped around his hand and was going hard. I hope he's in a league and Dave and Busters sponsors him"}
{"text":"I was not impressed, I really wanted to love this place!   The games are great but the customer service is terrible! My sister and myself took our daughters who are 6 ice skating in downtown Summerlin, so after we decided go to D&B sit for dinner and let the kids play some games after! We sat down right away, but our server never came back so we had to go ahead and find our own menus, after about 15 minutes of waiting. Then manger I'm assuming came by took our order. The food runner and the waitress delivered it the food was low key nasty bar food , we ordered about 75$ worth of stuff I wasn't satisfied, but whatever that's expected I guess . Then we had to go up to the bar since no waitress ever came around to fix my daughters drink because they got it wrong. After we were ready to go we told someone please can we have our check after waiting and waiting no one ever came around with our check we got up!    The kids were so anxious so we decided  to go play and they could just come find us. Which they did and we gladly paid. What a mess! After we were done our girls were super thirsty so the same bar area where we ate we said let's run up and get some bottled water lmao that took a while we finally got someone and she said oh no kids here, there was a man standing right by us with his son. I totally get that but it's just water and we already we're not happy about earlier. She was so rude and nasty and said well you can sit and order it with a server, are you serious. I then proceeded to tell a manager he just said i can't hear you and didn't give a shit. She finally said I'll just comp it and handed us two bottles of water. Customer service is everything I'm so disappointed with what we experienced!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for ladies night and bragging rights...lol there's a ton of games,  new and old. There's food and drinks too. I enjoyed the air hockey, basketball, and the walking dead game. I paid $23 for 125 tokens, it came out to $25. They charge you for the card so you might as well keep it. It's super loud because of all the games,  but it's fun every where you turn."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a good friends birthday and overall the atmosphere of the game bar are is awesome. The games are super cool and that part is definitely 5 stars, this review is solely on the restaurant. The food overall is not that great I ordered the appetizer boneless buffalo wings with fries. Service was alright, nothing great. The worst part comes at the end. I'm a person who works in the service industry and understand how important tipping is and usually tip people well when they deserve it. I gave our server (who I didn't catch his name) a 15% tip on around a $7 bill. As my friends and I were leaving the restaurant area our server confronted us (a group of girls) and continued to say \" Hey you guys, just so you know you should really take care of your server/bartender in the future you know we work off of tips\" yada yada... I was SO taken aback by the comment and that he even said something to us and I just looked at him and said \"yeah I get it I work for tips too\" and walked away and continued to tell him manager how unprofessional, offputting, and rude his comment was. I still cannot believe that a server would think it's okay to say something like that to a guest. Wish I would've given him a $0 tip now. Dave and busters is a cool place but you guys really need to get better waiters who know what costumer service is."}
{"text":"WOW!! Service is weak! Server did not provide any information about the game cards. Food was tasty but slow to come out. Seems like all the fun was at the server station instead of at the tables or games!!"}
{"text":"Worst f@@@ bartender ever .... f&&&&'.....don't come when this one is here 5/8/17 .....sorry I came to d&b while in Vaughn"}
{"text":"The experience was okay just like any other typical D&B. Some of the games were broken. The food was okay but there was only one waiter working our area. The Waiter Ehsan was awesome he did his best to accommodate us plus 10 other tables. He was great."}
{"text":"Yes it's fun for drinks and games but we went here for dinner and the food could've been better but our waitress literally told us it was sitting waiting out for her to bring to our table. My pasta wasn't bad but my boyfriends burger was pretty stale and cold. It wasn't even rush hour either-it was pretty empty in the restaurant. I also ordered a drink from the bar and the waitress forgot it. By the time I got it, it was melted and wasn't that good. I would definitely recommend going to the bar-I've had nothing but positive experiences there but the restaurant part of this place is not good at all."}
{"text":"WTF was I thinking? it was a rainy day and wanted to take kids somewhere where we can all enjoy and have fun.  everything is 3x the price of Chucky Cheese.  and you get nothing much in return.  Drinks were good, but on top of playing it was too pricy.  NOT WORTH IT!! TURN AROUND AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"}
{"text":"Nope. Just plain nope. The staff here seems like they hate their job. The manager was rude. The hostess wouldn't sit us together even though there were plenty of open tables so 8 of our group sat at one table and 3 sat across the way. The food was AWFUL. I mean you obviously wouldn't come here for a steak but even the bar food was terrible. Their pizza...nope. It's a quesadilla with tomato sauce and crap cheese on top. The waitress didn't fill my water once. Awful. Don't bother.  Oh and the games...half were broken and expensive! No help walking around."}
{"text":"Friday - Check. Wellness day at work - Check. Free food and game card- Check, Check, check. Seriously how can this be a bad day when you are get to leave work and go eat and play games. The good thing about it was that it was early in the afternoon so it was not as packed with kids. Although there were a handful that were there that lead me to the question why the hell weren't ya'll in school?  At any rate, we had a grand ole time playing all the different games and trying to get as many tickets as possible. I was stuck on Fruit Ninja since I like to play that came on my Xoom. I swear it wore me out lol. Seriously though, it was great way to spend the afternoon with my crazy coworkers. I doubt if I will go on a Friday night, but during the week or early on the weekend, maybe."}
{"text":"This place has definitely downgraded.  Each game takes more points now.  It's ridiculous to what it was before. Also for a place that has a restaurant I would expect clean bathrooms. Bathrooms are absolutely filthy and 4 of them were clogged.  Overall it's a fun atmosphere & the food is pretty good at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I, along with three friends, went to this location on Saturday night. It was very busy, and there were lines, but they moved along pretty quickly. The Dining Host table gave us an estimate for the wait for a table, and they were pretty much on the mark! We played several of the MANY, many games until we received the text message that our table was ready. I was impressed with the menu!  Great selections, including beer and mixed drinks. The only reason that this review is not 5-star goes to food service. Let me be clear... the selection was great, and the food quality was great, but the service was struggling. We had a wonderful  waitress - very friendly and knowledgeable, but either she was overwhelmed, OR they aren't properly organized. I don't attribute that to her, but to food service management. We had a very good meal, but it took a long time. The waitress got her full tip, management got four stars instead of five. All that being said - go there!  It is so much fun! Everyone enjoyed the evening and we will return soon."}
{"text":"The restroom is sooo dirty, this people even know how to manage business? How can your brand new work like that? Also the games are not that new, nothing special just old games we all know"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Impromptu stop during a trip. Always get a slushie. They are small but strong and fruity. Food was fast. And the bartender was awesome. Paying attention to our every need. Didn't forget anything. We got to play 2 of the new games for free. The alien covenant and Mario. The shopping center it's in is awesome as well with a movie theater so explore."}
{"text":"i'd like to start by saying that their food is amazing... not the eat & play combos, the food from their man menu, its delicious! the ribs are fall of the bone! and the baked pasta was soooo good. I used to order the eat & play combos and didnt really enjoy the food especially the \"build your own fajitas/tacos\" dont try!   It's a great playground for adults, I've try every game here... fav would be the basketballs games, wheel of fortune, deal of no deal, all shooting arcade games... still trying to beat jumpin' jackpot!  the prizes arn't so great unless you collect them... to get something like an ipod..."}
{"text":"Great service from Lisa!  Ordered the buffalo wing burgers and friend shrimp and both were really good.  Still, we were sad to see that the pretzel bites were taken off the menu, those were my favorite!  All in all, Lisa made this a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Visit Date 9/30/2017 Dave & Busters is so over rated! The great thing is  they have games for ALL ages  and TV's on the wall.   FOOD: JUST AWFUL!! I had the Nachos, with all them chips (that tasted old by the way) I think I had about two tablespoons of cheese... I was like I thought Nachos was suppose to have cheese. My sons had the bacon hamburger they said it had no taste. My daughter had the BBQ sandwich and said it was nasty. My poor husband had order the loaded  fries, when looking at the menu the fries looked really good BUT WHEN WE GOT THEM IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT PHOTO!!!! I will add a photo of both, what they SUPPOSED to look like and what they looked like when got them. The first time they brought him the fries out it was with the sweet potato fries and then he got his real order and it looked like some cheese fries(you will see the difference in the photo). So I asked to talk to the manager and explained we don't expect our food to like just like the photo, but at least eye appealing. She gonna say \"I will take that off your tab would you like something else?\" My husband order chicken wings. So after a 1 hour and 15 mins my husband was finally able to eat. The manager should have taken off his chicken. Then I get the check and they had charged my for both fries (the first one they bought out that was WRONG and the second order), yes it was taking off BUT STILL WAY WAS THE SECOND EVEN PUT ON MY CHECK THEY MESSED UP NOT ME!!!!   Inside:  They redesigned D&B, one side is more like the sports side and the other is more not the restaurant. In the back is the game room and bowling alley. Nice design compared to how it used to look"}
{"text":"A large group of us went here for a friend's birthday party. I ordered an adult beverage and it was watered down and straight juice. I ordered one of their patron drinks, patron is not a subtle alcohol you'll definitely always taste it. I let my waiter know this and instead of just taking the drink back to the bar and letting them fix it. He said he would let the manager know, which would have been fine except a manager never came. They didn't offer to fix my drink or remedy the situation in any way. Extremely disappointed and will never come here for drinks again."}
{"text":"This was the one of the worst experiences. As a first timer, I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!! First our server was not attentive. We were one of 4 tables in the restaurant and based on our service you would've thought it was a packed house. He proceeded to take our order, we ordered an appetizer and I asked to substitute my fries for onions rings. 30 mins later our entrees came out, I didn't receive my onion rings..we received our appetizer once we were half way done with our entrees. One entree had a steak asked to me cooked medium rare and came out medium well. I notified them that I was suppose to have onion rings with my meal, onion rings came out at the same time as the appetizer. Our server never took responsibility for pretty much forgetting to put the appetizer in or the substitution. We were charged $3.99 for a side substitution which I was notified it was no charge to sub my fries out. The onion rings were greasy and tasted like they had been cooked in fryer oil that needed to be changed. On top of all of this, our server was seen getting his hair \"played\" with by a female coworker. Maybe if he wasn't being distracted he probably would've gotten our order correct. We did speak with a female manger who did show genuine concern about our issues, she did discount our full bill, which was appreciated. I asked for a to-go cup for my WATER and was told they don't have to-go cups  but I could walk around with my glass. Who doesn't have to-go cups?? Wasn't even offered a child's cup. To have food prices as high as they do you would expect better service and the food not be mediocre. This experience really messed up our fun day because we had planned to eat and stay to play but why spend anymore money in an establishment who started your first experience off to a terrible start! I most likely will not be back to this location. Maybe it's better service when it's super packed and busier but I'll never find out. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and today they refused our business because two us were 18 and I had a 17 year old brother with me. Came on a Wednesday morning and no one else was there except a large middle school who was allowed to be in there, but they didn't want to let us in. I completely understand that on a Friday or Saturday night, but on Wednesday morning? Are you kidding me? Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was a litttle slow and the food only slightly above average.  Even with things for kids to do there, not sure it is worth going to again."}
{"text":"Go for the combo deal! It is worth the money. Always a good time at D&B! Food and service is great and of course love to play the games!"}
{"text":"We just had our Christmas party here for work. The private rooms are great. We had a private waitress that did a good job. Food was good, bbq chicken.  Kids food was good too and a great option vs. Paying adult price for buffet. Very happy with the game cards and overall presentation of food and drinks in our room."}
{"text":"My sweet and kind wife and I ended something different in a Sunday so I had the crazy idea to try Dave and Busters.  We had always aren't is place but never have tried it.  Well it was great. The place so huge. It has video games, a small Bowling ally, pool tables and plenty of food and drinks. We played video game and had a great time. The place did not smell like a bar and it was clean and friendly.   We didn't have any food but I hear is is good. The games were all working  and well maintained. The selection is great and the pice was reasonable. I hear weds is the best day as it is half priced games.   We had a wonderful time. We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Had a really good time. Went on a Thursday and it wasn't too busy. The food was really good! Had boneless buffalo wings and spinach dip! Also two happy hour drinks! Price was under $20! The games were all working and really fun! A lot of fun for the whole family. Wish they had one in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is good for a drop in date. Although the prices seem to be a bit more than a typical arcade. The only time I try to reload my card is when I get the recharge for 20 and get 20 worth of play. Which is why I recommend the mobile app or the email list to take advantage of this. I really want to go on Wednesday's when it's half priced. There are plenty of fun games but your money can go fast if you're not paying attention to your tokens. I only come for the games each time I've tried the food here it's been mediocre. Like bad bar food. But the servers are always nice when I ask them for something to drink while I'm playing."}
{"text":"This place just recently opened in Las Vegas. I went to one in Michigan before, and that one I remember being a little bigger, and I felt like the games were very close together at this location! But overall it was still fun.   I was sent a coupon by downtown Summerlin where I got $20 free game play with $20 game play purchase. I literally spent all my time at the Star Wars game!   It's addicting! There were a few other games I played too but this one I got almost my entire party hooked!"}
{"text":"We had my cousin's Deployment Party at this location in late February and couldn't have been more pleased! Bethany was able to secure a space for our large party on the upstairs patio allowing us to decorate and celebrate in a private area. The room charge was reasonable and the food came out quickly! Our server was a rock star ensuring everyone was taken care of without ever an empty glass in the room. There were so many games to choose from and the kids had a blast! I personally loved the shrimp and steak linguine with a orange blossom beer on the side. Great place for a fun day and easy to work with for events. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The games are a lot of fun. And the food is actually very good.   We ordered the Philly cheese steak and ribs with Mac and cheese. The chefs in the back forgot that we requested no onions on the cheesesteak, so when they brought it back they brought it back with no veggies as well.   We didn't mind but our waiter noticed and he realized it and decided to take the extra step in getting some veggies for us. It was extremely thoughtful!   Our waiter was very good and he was fairly attentive. His name was Justin and he knew the items well and the best way to handle situations big or small.    The games were so much fun. We ended up with a ton of tickets.. Got a few of the items (not much to choose from) which wasn't too fun and then decided to give the rest away to some cute little kid. It was a great time and money and time well spent playing video games for tickets. Too bad it wasn't money lol."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for any occasion! My husband and I normally stop in for happy hour with a quick appetizer and some games. The facility is always clean and properly staffed for busy weekend nights. I'd suggest coming in before 5pm to take advantage of the eat and play combos that will definitely save you some money. They have dining tables, bar tables, bar stools and standing tables in the gaming area for whatever suits your needs. Be sure to hold on to your card to refill credits (or you have to buy another) and save your tickets for something cool. I'd recommend joining their email list- they normally send out buy $20 in games and get $20 free- what a deal!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Monday night and bought about 125 coins, they didn't go as fast as I was expecting for the two of us. Great location, and it wasn't at all crowded with it being Monday. We had a lot of fun and it made for a unique date night!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with friends, even if it's over priced.. It's the atmosphere. However, I don't like how it's overran by kids younger than 10yrs old. Most being under 5. It's almost midnight here, and someone is changing diapers.. I don't understand how there isn't a age limit last a certain time. It's still a sports bar atmosphere, which is what they're trying to market on tv right now.. So I guess it's a bad mix of letting your kids wander around free while you drink at the bar and somewhere fun to chill with you friends. It's not an adult atmosphere.. I'm sure they'd get more business if it were...... I shouldn't be running into 3yr olds this late at night."}
{"text":"I like that they finally have a location out here in Las Vegas, now I can finally redeem my tickets instead of driving back to Cali lol. I come here for happy hour, all the cocktails are half priced so it's nice to be able to try out the whole menu rather than paying $10 for each drink. And as far as the food on happy hour, I wished they had more... they have spinach dip, chicken quesadilla, wings and I forgot what else for only $5. On drinks, so far I've tried the watermelon coronita (good), island coconut coronita (didn't like), backwoods blueberry lemonade (would order again) they give a little shot glass on the side with strawberry moonshine. Next time I'll probably try the food and play some games"}
{"text":"This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.  Walking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.  Un-nerving actually.   Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.  As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.  But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.  And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.  Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.  Trust."}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy with the family. The food was great and the games were awesome!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant/bar.  I am not one to complain but this takes the cake.  25 minutes to get drinks, 45 minutes to place order for food.  Asked waitress questions, like have you entered the kids orders she looked confused, ask several times for place settings, got them half way trough meal.  Forgot one our kids meals.  Took an hour & 15 minutes to get food from the time we sat.  Waitress finally advised kitchen was behind, yet when we got our food it was cold.  Advised the Manager of the frustration & his answer was well we are sorry, there's nothing we can do now that it already happened.  Could've offered an ice cream for the kids or a little free play, after all we paid full price for hopefully decent food & service at best and they greatly failed at that.  Felt robbed of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"We had a good time but, There weren't enough servers and food was ok. The sliders i got were small and wings were really to hot to eat. Server didn't bring us kids menu's, and seem irritated that we were asking for drinks at all. Then we lost of of our cards, in one of the machines and it took them 20 min to get it all figured out, boy what a mess.  the whole reason we went was for my sons birthday (10) and we waited 15 min to get a drink and no bar tender available for longer. Manager comped our drinks, thas was nice.  I might go again, but I hope it will be better."}
{"text":"Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).  First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.  The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.  Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.  I will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first."}
{"text":"This is for the unprofessional bartenders despite the fact I enjoyed their game deal which is half off on Wednesdays. We ordered food and drinks. The drinks came fast but the wait on the food is quite long. Top of that he brought it out without acknowledging where's the food supposed to head to. Instead, he handed to those girls sitting next to us even though one of them TOLD him straight they didn't order that. But he said it's ok to those girl until we help him out by saying it's ours. I found its funny because if food was brought out. you know it has to be someone on this bar ordered it. Right? I coulda just be quite and ask about my food right after he hand my food to those girls. Lol. Other than that we had a fun night over the arcade section."}
{"text":"The food was good got plenty of it. Courtney was are waitress she was prompt to wipe are table take are drink order she did a great job. So you can go for the food. The gaming is the issue. I can't believe that they charge so much for the CARD! Games are over priced and many were breaking done when we were playing them as for the prizes when you spend 185.00 on The CARD and get 9785 points give the extra 215 so both grandkids can get a top prize."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service EVER. I guess that's what I get going out to eat with my 6 month old son! All the waiters commented on how cute he was, but I waited half an hour for a clean fork. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good and the drinks are decent. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is energetic. Lots of televisions for watching sports and tons of games for those who are not interested in watching the game."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's is the bomb dot com! Sure, you can spend a small fortune and only get a stuffed animal in return. But that is the American way people. Get with the program.  I have been to the Columbus location as well as this location. Lemme tell you, this location is leaps and bounds better in terms of size, amount and variety of games, restaurant size and parking. Whoever said size doesn't matter....has never been to D&B!  I love the updates they have made with decor. Much more modern and updated. They have moved the pool tables and went down to one shuffleboard game. But I like the new location of these games.  The midway is always clean and presentable and the games are in working order. I love the game selection and rarely have a long wait to play a game. I love the fact you can eat in the midway here. It makes it easy for families who want to let the kids play while the adults eat :)  3 negative things I have for this location would be the long line at the front desk and only one person running it. Frustrating to say the least. The same goes for the redemption counter in back....and the bathrooms could really use updated and cleaned. I am very sad these bathrooms weren't part of the updates. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the bathrooms...."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once just to play games and the second time to eat and play. Both times there was a good amount of people there, but because it is so big it is not an issue. They have happy hour pricing and on Wednesday do half price games.  THE FOOD: We came in and waited right at the front of the first visible dining area and waited about 10 minuets before we were told we could seat ourselves. At least from what we saw, nothing notified you about seating yourself until we asked someone up front. There is also a dining area where they seat you which I didn't find out until reading reviews. Right when we sat ourselves down someone came over and took our order and returned with our drinks promptly. We ordered two different burgers and both were actually pretty good. The only downside was it was a little pricier than what we expected and personally don't think I'd eat there again for my first choice. It is something to try once because most of their menu is over the top which is fun every once and a while. I would recommend checking their menu out online before coming in, and might even say just eat before coming in as dinner and the games add up quickly.   THE GAMES: Hands down the best part. There's a ton of different options and even if it's crowded there's so many games you can always find one open. You get a little card (like a debit card) that you load coins on so you can swipe and play the games. Your points are loaded onto your card after each game and never expire so you can come back and use it again. 200 or so coins lasted us about an hour and a half and we enjoyed every second. The games, based on what I earned, give an awesome amount of tickets. We even hit jackpot on 3 different games just on our last two visits, so the games are easy. The prizes are attainable and not just candy and plastic bracelets.  Go in on a Wednesday for half price games, load $30 onto your card and you will have hours of fun with whoever you are with. This is what we will be doing."}
{"text":"So we ordered our appetizers and they came out asked for silverware napkins and plates 15 minutes later still None finished our loaded tots still no napkins plates or silverware server came by our table reminded him twice finally got it Macaroni is extremely dry and cold Sever did apologize and was friendly"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has gotten such a negative reaction from some people.   Beer... and video games.  Sign me up!  In my opinion, this place knocks the socks off of Gameworks.  When I drink beer at Dave and Buster's, I don't have to go upstairs, drink, go downstairs, play, then go upstairs again.  The viscious cycle has been removed.  I can set my beer right next to the arcade.  Gameworks is fun, sure, but I think that little kids are gross.  They have boogers on their fingers.  There aren't any booger-fingery little bastards running around at D & B.    This place can be a little pricey, but it's not overly pricey.  These aren't dive bar prices.  The way I see it, I'm paying a little extra so as to remove myself from the threat of having a baby scream right next to me, right when I'm about to shoot a zombie.  Also, one time, I won enough tickets to get a Star Wars film cell.  Dorky?  You're damn right, it is.  Is that shit hanging up on a shelf at home, right now, as we speak?  You're damn right, it is."}
{"text":"Dont come here if your planning on visitng west gate for food and drinks and fun. Only if plan on eating here because if you bring out side food from the other restaurants thats in a to go box and then try to go in there for drinks and stuff they will kick you out! Seems like maybe they should had put thier building in another place by its self instead of sharing an entertainment property together espeacilly when you have guest that are from out town and can't just run out to their car &put the food away. the girl at the front desk thats a little  heavier set with glasses and brunette was very rude about it as well"}
{"text":"Had a blast, food was amazing, drinks were amazing and the games were bad ass. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"SHAUN E. is THE BEST SERVER ever. He has always made our experience wonderful. I had to write a review because of him. We really appreciate him going above and beyond for us. No other servers compare. Thank you Shaun for remembering us and treating us like VIP. my daughter loves coming here once a week and he so sweet to her. It's nice knowing we will get excellent service and fun games. We love half price Wednesday's!"}
{"text":"I am sorry but a group of us went here and the bartenders did not have good customer service. I understand it was busy but we had money to spend and we still tipped them great. All they had to do was say hey we will get to you when we can."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for their Eat and Play $15.99 dinner/game deal. Figure $10 worth of games we'd like to play anyway and a $6 meal. The reason they get 4 stars was the food. i figured the food would be an afterthought to a place like this, but it turned out to be quite good, and not just one plate. i went with the Double Stacked Chicken Parm and it was delish. The special lady friend went against her normal eating habits and got the Philly Cheesesteak and she was very satisfied with her choice.  As far as games, pretty standard affair. Played some air hockey, shot some wild game, shot some zombies, shot some basketballs.  They also had a beer special on Bud Light for like $2.39 when we were there.  Overall, surprisingly satisfied."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar, my margarita tasted like juice and my fiancé's beer had two inches of empty space at the top when he got it. My burger was over cooked. The bartenders were rude. Children everywhere and it was after 9 on a Sunday?"}
{"text":"I've never been to Dave & Buster's and I'm not much of a gamer so I wasn't sure what to expect but I actually had a great time.   We had a private work event here and the area we had reserved was so spacious with tons of seating and a buffet which included appetizers (chips and spinach, meatballs), dinner (salmon, mashed potatoes, cesar salad, veggies, pasta, meat), and dessert (chocolate mousse, fruit, and more). To drink i had two daiquiris -- one strawberry and one pineapple, both of which were delicious -- and the worst mojito I've ever tasted (tasted like a pre-made mixture mixed with rum).   Overall, the food was mediocre but what really makes this place is the large arcade! This is where all the fun really happens so I'd definitely go back for a date night or with a group of family/friends."}
{"text":"It had been about three years since we set foot in a Dave & Buster's, probably more like 6 years since we'd been to this particular location, so we decided to stop in on a recent Saturday night. Why? I'm still not entirely sure why we did it. Part reminiscing. Part self-immolation. Whatever the reason, what follows is a brief recap of our experience.   We arrived around 18:30 on a Saturday. The enormous parking lot, large enough to land a 737 in, was already starting to feel crowded. We parked the Soul away from the other cars. We, unlike most of America, are not afraid of walking.  Upon entering we headed straight back to the bar. It was still relatively empty. We took a couple of chairs and bellied up. Nothing has changed, at least not in this part of the building. Same dark wood, same slightly wobbly bar stools, even the same stale beer selection. Our bartender, Shelly, was perfect. It's rare that you find such genuine hospitality in the service industry anymore. I've become so accustomed to the banal indifference worn by most restaurant industry employees that I hardly find the energy to complain. I am, however, still impressed by good service. Well done, Shelly.  As we sipped our drinks, I languishing over a neutered vodka tonic the wife enjoying the college-remembrace known as the Long Island Iced Tea, we decided upon dinner. The food at Dave & Buster's is actually better than average. The offering, all American, is filled with chicken, ribs and steak. There are a few spots of originality scattered throughout like potato puffs and pretzel dogs. It's generally unhealthy food designed for maximum caloric impact but it's good for a treat.  Chicken Tortilla Soup - This D&B staple has been around since day one and it hasn't changed a bit. Packed with cheese, crunchy tortilla strips, cubes of white meat chicken and a tomato broth, it makes for a heartier than expected soup. Hints of cilantro and very low levels of heat make for a tasty starter.  Sweet Apple Pecan Salad - One word dominates this flavor profile: sweet. The mixed greens (a nice diversion from the land of Romaine) are tossed with paper-thin apple slices, sweet and crunchy candied pecans, crumbles of bleu cheese and raspberry vinaigrette. A little too much dressing for me but we had no problem finishing the entire thing.  Roasted Turkey Avocado BLT - My wife really enjoyed this sandwich. Roasted turkey, crispy bacon, tomato, creamy slices of avocado and mayo on whole-grain bread. The bread was soft, glutenous and chewy. The accompanying seasoned fries were cooked a perfect golden brown.  Fire-Grilled Salmon - This was a pleasant surprise. Ordering salmon at a place like Dave & Buster's? Am I crazy? The risk paid off. The salmon filet, chargrilled, was cooked perfectly. Tender, flaky and moist topped with peppercorn garlic butter. The sauteed spinach was very buttery and the sweet potato fries I got instead of the spicy rice were great.  After dinner we wandered back into the bowels midway for some gaming. Holy shit, there are a lot of kids here. I'm talking enough kids to make most sane people decide never to have them or those with kids not to have any more. This place makes Chuck E. Cheese look like a corner bar. I know, it was a Saturday night. That didn't help. We did our best to ignore the throngs and moved in.  Since we'd last been here this area has changed quite a bit. It's still extremely loud, extremely crowded and almost unbearably chaotic. There are now quite a few touch screen games. The exact same games on your iPad and smartphone, only bigger - Fruit Ninja, Doodlejump, Infinity Blade. There's also your ticket games if that's your thing. We hit Wheel of Fortune, some pirate shooter, trivia, and a few others before the sensory overload and overpopulation took their toll.  I don't think we'll every be back. This is not a place for us anymore. It was a place for us about 15 years ago. The kids, soccer moms, always annoyed teenagers and divorced dads with weekend visitation rights can have it. It's time to burn the torch of Dave & Buster's and remember them how they used to be, an after-work hangout, a playground for adults, a haven from the pre-pubescent."}
{"text":"Attended an event that was held here and was impressed with the service and food. I think it may have been the best non-homemade macaroni and cheese I have ever had. We played games after and we all enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Idk how many times I have to call just to make a reservation for my son's birthday for some to actually give a damn and call back. They are inconsiderate, and unprofessional. Even when the special events coordinator did call and I told her we were looking for a different venue she didn't even bother to ask why or rectify the issue. Just said well thank you anyway and hung up! They need to step their game up, guess I was excited about going there for nothing. I would never recommend anyone to book a party here."}
{"text":"As far as games and entertainment this place is amazing. Recently they have a few games you can play for free that are newer with certain restrictions. The only downside is the service in the bar area. Tables were very messy and service was extremely slow. I guess when you are in a area predominantly college students service may end up mediocre."}
{"text":"We had our work holiday party here (lunch). The service was good.  The person we had to help us though the lunch and the games package we ordered was fine.  Very energetic.  And kept the group together. The food was ok. Pretty standard.  Lots of food.   The games we played were fun. But after when we had some time to pick games ourselves, some of the machines were down. It was hard to find staff to help us with the money on the game card and the tickets. Some games were really quick (especially if you didn't know how the game worked).   The prize selection was good. They had a lot of different items on the shelves."}
{"text":"This d and b does a solid job. My kids always enjoy it and it keeps them entertained. The reason i have finally got around to writing a review now is that we held a bday party here. We had food done with dave an busters and i was pleasantly surprised. It was some solid bar good! Not the best i have had but good enough. Kids could run around and everyone was happy. Parents too ;)"}
{"text":"We came to the Westgate location today to have some fun as a family and stay out of the heat.  We were extremely disappointed to find that the air conditioning was either not on or was not working well, it was very uncomfortable !  We had planned on eating lunch there but it was too warm for us and we left and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am pretty happy we finally have a D&B in Vegas!! And Downtown Summerlin is a great location for it! Being a native of this city, I have only had the opportunity of visiting one other Dave & Buster's in St. Louis, MO. Other than this one being a lot smaller, I'd say they have the same set up pretty much everywhere.  I am personally a HUGE fan of places who cater to families, and not just ones with small children. I am a young mom with a 14 year old, and this place is perfect for a decent priced dinner, and safe entertainment for all ages, especially those older, hard to please young adults. (or parents who'd enjoy a cocktail while playing games) We recently had a work event here as, and it was a huge success. The event/catering staff were so helpful. From set up of our presentation, to lettings us borrow a cord when we didn't have one, down to the salmon, I was impressed!  Sure, you may not get the top of the line steak and seafood, but I don't think you come here expecting that either. I love the prizes they have in exchange for the game play. Shot glasses, and kitchen gadgets, HECK YES!  I would also like to point out that Metro is on property keeping people in line when needed. Their presence is appreciated, when its midnight, people are drinking and getting loud, and unfortunately do not always know how to act. I was pleased to see the police escorting out some obnoxious, disrespectful patrons with their pants down to their knees, a pacifier in their mouths, and loud uncalled for language. And do not be fooled, these were adults. Overall, I am extremely happy with what they have brought to the Downtown Summerlin community, and I welcome them with open arms!"}
{"text":"I'm used to the Dave and Busters in Cleveland Ohio which is the size of a small city  This Dave and Busters is much smaller than the Cleveland one, and it didn't have a lot of my favorite games  :(  Next time I'll just stick in my hood and go to Gameworks  Dave and Busters - Gameworks - Jillians = all the same!  THEY'RE THE SAME!  Just go to the one closest to your house.  Boo."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received in my entire life. Especially Sara, the bartender: rude, disrespectful, and mean. And Josh, the manager that works on Mondays. Worst service of all time. Never come here. Terrible place"}
{"text":"Dave and Busters was a blast last night!!  Yummy drinks and good customers service......it's def the place to go if you're a kid at heart"}
{"text":"This is another place that had the WOW factor when it opened and has gone down hill every since then. Right from the begging the game were over priced, so that has never changed.  But back in the day there was a doorman that added class and he would hand out tokens to the kids as they came in.  The Restaurant always seemed elegant and classy but the food has gone down hill.  It does seem that this place has a destiny to become a Chucky Cheese in the future.  I don't think I will be going back anymore, it's not convient to get too and blowing $150.00 for me and my family is just a little much!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of selecting this place to meet up with my family who were visiting from Florida.  Waited at bar for 20 minutes before be able to order a drink even though there were only 3 other people at the bar. Once the bartender did decide to wait on me, he was very short \"What will you have?\" and proceeded to give me a a receipt for the amount due before I could order 6 more drinks for the rest of our party??? We eventually left that bar after no one returned to our group sitting at the bar for the following 25 minutes.   We then moved onto the restaurant where we waited for 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Food was pretty good.  Moved onto gaming area where approximately 1 out of 5 games were not operating properly. This place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years. We will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"Probably a place to avoid. Never been to a D&Bs before and I was disappointed. Place is nice inside, food is average at best but the staff is poor. Stopped in to catch a game and grab lunch. The place ws pretty dead for a Saturday at noon. And even still it took a long time to get our order. Food took over 50 minutes to come and we ordered an appetizer that was delivered with the meal. I thought maybe it was just us but a couple next to us had to leave without getting their food.   Doubt I'd return with so many good places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch and games on a weekday. The food is just okay, the service is the same. We have been here on the weekend and it's a disaster. Terrible food, way too busy, and not the place for small children. The last time I went here a lot of the games weren't working and there were issues with the games also reading my cards. Pretty annoying."}
{"text":"It's pretty big. Service kind of stinks but hey, it's not a regular restaurant right?..."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever had in any establishment in westgate. Do not sit in Karla's area, she is not attentive to any of your needs. On multiple occasions I had to ask for a refill on our drinks. Then the management staff was slightly helpful and gave us a discount, but still charged us for food we didn't eat. This place failed on so many levels. Done with Dave and busters!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place just weirds me out. It's always being advertised as the Chuck E Cheese for adults, but it was still literally swarming with kids..... so I'm a little confused.   I went to D&B on a Saturday night to watch the Jones vs. Cormier UFC fight. We got there around 7pm and it was packed. I mean like \"wait 30 minutes to check your coat\" packed. I was not amused. My friend's insisted though that it would clear out by 10pm (when the fights started), so I didn't complain. I decided to just roll with it and got some game credits as we ventured to the back. First initial thought: \"holy hell its kid Vegas...\". This place was literally overrun by kids, neon lights, and drunk parents. You could barely move without almost stepping on a 5 year-old while simultaneously spilling their mom's neon blue Bacardi snowcone. Needless to say it made for a very strange atmosphere. We ended up leaving at 11:30pm before the big fight because who wants to watch guys beat this shit out of each other at the bar while kids run around with unicorn stuffed animals?  Moral of the story: steer clear of adult Chuck E Cheese."}
{"text":"Ok so who doesn't like a good time and a full belly?! It's awesome when you can get both in one spot. Dave and Busters has always been a go to favorite of mine! The newest one and only on thus far in Vegas is great! It's great for family night, friends night, or girls night! The food is delicious and the selection is ridiculous...i love it! The location is in beautiful Downtown Summerlin which is a plus because I just love the unrealistic scenic views of the mountains and clouds. This time I tried the Steak and Shrimp Linguini Pasta and Oh Boy let me tell you how AWESOMELY SATISFIED my taste buds were...im already feening for more! My husband had the Loaded Sweet Potatoe Fries that were very uniquely delish!! We even got a great deal on tokens with the \"EatAndPlay\" bundle...Go Check It Out!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place... cool vibe. Only rating a 3 because the bartender situation was horrible. Some chick names Jenn looked straght at us multiple times and kept helping people who walked up after us. Pretty embarassing. Her and another older bar back kept high fiving and talking about protein powder while there was a huge line. Saturday, fight night- you would expect a higher standard on such a busy night. Would give 5 stars but management should be aware. We finally got taken care of by another bartender named Matt. He was hella cool and fixed our experience. Big ups to those who actually work on the company's dime."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service first time around. There was no one at the host stand when we got here and we got scolded for sitting down at a table that seemed to be self seating in the bar area.  We put our name in and then waited 30 minutes for a table which is t unreasonable for a Friday night. However, we ordered drinks and one person got a beer rather than a hard cider. Waitress was very nice (the only pleasant part of the experience). Then we waited 30 minutes for an appetizer and the cascades was drowned in jalapeños and the wings were cold. The manager was very accommodating and comped our  meal."}
{"text":"We had a networking event at the Dave & Buster's in Desert Ridge on 11/1/17. The event coordinator Susan and her staff were awesome. Food and service was great. We had our event on the new patio that was recently added. Everyone enjoyed the event and the atmosphere. We highly recommend Dave & Buster's in Desert Ridge for any type of event."}
{"text":"My work had lunch and a meeting here and provided us with prepaid game cards. The catering for lunch was excellent, the food was very good, the meeting room was just fine for our large group, and we all enjoyed the many game options. The only negative: This place is in the HORRIBLE Tempe Marketplace. If it were anywhere else I could see me returning frequently with my grandchildren."}
{"text":"This is an adult/kid restaurant/gaming place. Sports on all the TV's, kids running everywhere. It's a large space and never felt overwhelmed by all the people. Food was decent, definitely not the place to just come to dinner. Come play and eat! It's loud and if you can stand the sports announcing, this is your place...."}
{"text":"This place is always fun to visit on any occasion!  Especially for the Hello Kitty prizes.  Always good to look forward to.  Features arcade gaming fun for kids and adults alike.  You have to check which ons actually give you tickets to redeem towards a prize.  There are also billiards tables, a bar and of course a restaurant dining experience.    Tried the food for the first time since visiting a few times already.    Middle of the day, service was surprisingly slow.  I can't even think of an excuse for this.    Anyway, I was having lunch and ordered a broccoli and cheese soup.  It was yummy, but very fattening indeed. I barely saw an broccoli.  It's good for munchies when your drunk I suppose.  Prices are ok, I think il just stocl to the gaming aspect, which is truly the reason why I visit at all."}
{"text":"Great place to come here for a fun filled evening with your S.O or group of friends. Had a great time with our friends and won lots of tickets! Wait time was a bit long at the bar, but we did get our shots...eventually. One of my favourite places to go however can get really busy on the weekend. Buy lots of credit so you can play everything!"}
{"text":"I hope the manager sees this!! If not, I'm going to submit my service survey online as well because this crap with this specific location needs to end. I don't spend my hard earned money to come to an establishment and get the worst possible service ever. Came in tonight for food and games. It took a waitress 10 minutes to come to our table to get our drink order. Took her another 10 minutes to bring the drinks and then another 10 to come back for our food order. After the food order went in I think we sat there for another 15 minutes for some kids mini sliders and a chicken and cheese quesadilla. The food wasn't great but I never expect it to be since it never has been, nor will it ever be.  After we ate we waited about 30 minutes before I had my friend go find the manager and ask for our bill. It was explained to the manager that the service was poor and we never knew where our waitress was when we needed something. It was also explained how long we'd been waiting. He didn't care. Made no effort to rectify the situation. I did notice that a few other tables had flagged down the same manger as well and I overheard them all say the same thing...waitress was MIA, service was poor and they just wanted to pay their bill and leave but she never came to bring it. Again, this manger could give two f**ks about the situation.  This location seems to get worse and worse each time I go and at this point, I think I'm done spending my money here."}
{"text":"Well after having lunch at Dave & Buster in the Cabo Chicken. Than coming back to try the BLT Turkey Burger for dinner; my judgement in food is top quality and value. Both entrees I had were well laid out to be visually appealing and very taste. I ordered the Turkey burger because most places tend to dry the turkey burger patty, here my patty was perfect not soggy or dry like a Las Vegas summer. The sweet potato fries stand the test of being warm and seasoned just right.      As for the rest of the experience our server was funny and attentive. For being extremely busy on the grand opening she kept the drinks filled and when the food was taking longer than normal she apologized and offered to let us go play the games while our food waited.       As for the decor and games, they are great."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever at a Dave and Busters. There was a meal/play card deal available. All four of us in my group did this. I ordered the blackened BBQ chicken. It came with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. We also got a $10 play card with the meal, meals being $16.99 (on the set I ordered from). I ended up getting 48 credits and played before eating and after eating. Food took about 20 min, nothing unusual. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the rest was awesome. The games were fun but I didn't realize there would be so many little kids! Haha I don't know why I thought kids wouldn't be there. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had my sons 8th birthday party and it was so perfect. It was real chill and cool and fun! I really enjoyed it and was amazed with such good food! Compared to other places like gameworks this food was sooooooo good! Garnett was my server and he was great, I mean as great as he could be, it was a Saturday evening. I enjoy this place every time I go though, and so do my kids, nieces, nephews, grandkids, other half, just everyone"}
{"text":"Very good place for games! A lot of games! Delicious food and drinks! People of different ages can play! Good places to relax with family and friends!))"}
{"text":"I love it because it has so many great games!! And great food and prizes! The little shop is so amazing and cute!(the prizes are also very very good and cute)"}
{"text":"My company recently had an employee + family event here.  We rented a room and had it catered.  They served us mexican food (tacos, chips, beans, rice, etc) and kid friendly food (chicken fingers, mini pizzas and mini burgers).  The food was really good.  My son, husband and I had a really great time playing all the games. The prize counter also has decent prizes.    I would go here again.  I think it's a great place for families during the day and for adults at night."}
{"text":"Ok.. so, this place doesn't deserve it's two star status. I think it's definitely a solid three \"A-OK\" stars.  The games are, of course, fun. That's the best part. The prizes are traditional arcade prizes i.e. I got a deck of cards and some random trinkets. BUT you can exchange tickets for various food items! Definitely come here just for a night of fun and games (the photobooth is a blast, though $5 cash only).   However, the service is pretty subpar. Waited 15 minutes for drinks and one never showed until we reminded the waitress. I had a salad that was OK, $6 so I wasn't complaining. The pretzel pull apart bread left something to be desired. I would've liked to try more but it's a little spendy.   All in all - if you want to play some arcade games in the West Valley, come here. Don't let \"negative Yelp reviews\" for an arcade keep you away. The prices for gaming is standard. Get food elsewhere first then come here for drinks!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I had dinner there. My daughters were with me as we met up with some of my family. First off, when I walked in, it seemed very open and spacious. I liked how there were tvs pretty much everywhere, especially as this was a football night. When we sat down, we were greeted promptly. We ordered a few drinks to start and were given menus. It seemed that it took her a bit longer than it should have to get the beverages. Once we finally decided what we were going to eat, we wanted to order but she was no where to be found. We actually had to wait for the waitress...haha.  When we got the chance, I ordered the turkey burger that came with bacon, lettuce, tomato on a whole wheat bun. I chose to get a side of steamed veggies instead of fries to be a bit healthier. My kids got a hamburger and grilled chicken with fries. My family got tacos and grilled salmon. I was throughly impressed with my burger and the rest of my family seemed to enjoy their food as well.  So overall, the food was not what I expected in a good way, the service was slow and lack luster, but I enjoyed the sporty ambiance with all the tvs. Not a bad place to be for some casual time."}
{"text":"This place seriously sucks. I can't believe how horrible the service is and how mean all the staff are. I brought my office employees here to celebrate for a going away party and I really regret it. Not only does no one here have any interest in trying to accommodate the guests, they all have the most unpleasant and disgruntled faces of any people in customer service that I have ever seen. We got shuttled back and forth between two desks trying to even PUT OUR NAMES ON A LIST! A list!  Seriously. We were told we couldn't even put our name on the list until 75% of the party was present. Then it turns out that the staff is totally misinformed. Not only could we have gotten our name on the waiting list with half of our party present, they even told us that we needed to find a table in a \"self service, first come first served\" area that the manager then came out to tell us was a reservation only area. I wished I could give zero stars, but after speaking to Tom, the manager, we ended up getting taken care of in a timely manner. Only because of Tom could I now upgrade this review to 2 stars. Expect poor service from this fresh and inadequately trained staff."}
{"text":"Food is over priced for the quality. Plus Service was ok. Not great . Games are always fun."}
{"text":"We had a blast! I joined my husbands youth basketball team for a team dinner. Food was good, but the drinks were kind of weak. The games were loads of fun. There are people there of all ages, which was a plus so that I didn't feel out of place since I am close to 40...lol. I'd definitely go back again when I visit Vegas. There's free valet parking if which I don't really understand..but who cares."}
{"text":"I will never spend my money at this establishment ever again! The way we were treated after we spent over $200 on food, beverage, and games...the manager needs to learn conflict resolution skills....it's a shame.."}
{"text":"Maybe originally living in California, I got spoiled from my Dave n' Busters in Orange, but this is just average. Sat at the bar, it wasn't crowded, which was nice. The prizes after winning tickets were not that great because I guess they consider it gambling like s casino so it is limited. Had a few issues with the games but problems got resolved."}
{"text":"Came here recently for dinner and hangout time with cousins. On a Wednesday night during the summer, it wasn't very busy and in fact it seemed we had the whole dining area to ourselves. We all ordered from the special menu which offered cards for $10 or $20 worth of game play with the purchase of certain menu items.  We ordered the steak with fettuccine and rosé sauce. Others in our party ordered the Philly cheesesteak with fries, as well as the grilled chicken with steamed broccoli. Although not the best pasta I've had in terms of texture (was a bit gluey and overcooked), the rosé sauce with sundried tomatoes was pretty flavourful. Our server was very attentive and fun.  This was not my first time at D&Bs but it had been a long time since my last visit. I had forgotten what a great hangout place it is for young and old alike. They have such a vast array of games and activities that everyone can find something to enjoy and bring out the inner kid in themselves.  (95/100)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, and great atmosphere!   Fun Fun Fun!  Great family safe environment!"}
{"text":"Went in for a short lunch with some co workers, tho we didn't get to eat there our waitress was very kind. We took the food to go and played a few games."}
{"text":"Great location and lots of fun for all ages.  First, location wise you couldn't ask for better. It is in the center of Tempe Marketplace, very easy to find and right next door to the outdoor stage area. This is a nice area to hang outside if you get claustrophobic or just need a break from arcade-land.   As far as the venue, it's a pretty massive area. Bar, billiards, televisions and restaurant are up front; games and Carnie prizes are towards the back. The games only accept credits by way of a \"Power Card\", which needs to be reloaded at various kiosks around the floor. It is disturbingly similar to a Casino... and if you aren't careful, you can blow thru money nearly as fast. I like to negotiate a predetermined amount with my kids before entering the field. Fail to do this, and suffer the eventual sugarcrash-neon-meltdown. You've been warned.  Regarding their party planning service. This is my favorite part of DnB. I have now had two birthday kids parties here with my son's and a few adult graduation/birthday events.  It is such a fantastic venue! The staff really takes care of you. Just book your time slot, confirm number of people and show up. The decor/food/entertainment is all taken care of. There are different packages for any budget and they are very accommodating. If desired, you can bring in outside cake or additional decor. The only challenge is herding the kids, for young birthday parties. I recommend only parties with children old enough to \"return to base\". There are also semi-private rooms with large televisions, perfect for an adult or team party. Plus, the booze. Duh.  Really, nothing negative to say..  a rarity."}
{"text":"The following review is from our 8 year old boy:  I really like d and b. The only thing I didn't like was that you might loose who you are with. I got lost while playing a game. I like the arcade and bowling, they are so much fun. Mozzarella sticks are our favorite dish. Birthdays there are awsome."}
{"text":"I read the negative reviews. I can't say the family's experience was a negative one. The kids had a great time! It wasn't overly crowded and we found a table rather quickly. Our server was friendly, attentive and I have no complaints. Our food order was taken and the food arrived in reasonable time.  It was a pleasant night for the 6 of us.  We will definitely return.  Having coupons for food and game play helped minimize the cost. The power cards can be recharged.  I found the price to be reasonable as well. You have to expect to pay to play and eat in an adult playground such as this.  Use the discounts that are available."}
{"text":"Wow has this place changed. I hadn't been here in almost 4 years and it's like a whole new place! They no longer have the actual tickets and coins as they did previously. Personally, I enjoy using the old school coins and getting tickets. I do like that not having the paper tickets is better for the environment but come on! It felt more like a casino, if I want a casino I'll go to a casino. I wanted to play games like at the pizza places when you're younger. Clean place though and a large variety of games."}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was adequate. The games kept my daughter busy but the place was horribly understaffed.  Everything took forever including waiting to be served, waiting for our food and drink and waiting to pay our bill.   To top it off they had signs everywhere advertising a Labatt promotion that we were told was over. When we asked a manager about it we were told it was miraculously back on. How that happens is beyond me.   At the end of it there was no apology for any of the waits so bottom line is this place is now off my list of things to do. Dropping over 50 bucks on games so my kid can get a fake nail kit was really just the topper."}
{"text":"Something to know about me: I like food. I like drinking. I like playing games. I don't like children. This place is A-OK by those standards as after 9pm minors aren't allowed in the building.  We started in the dining half and went with the Eat & Play combos including the Steak Sandwich, the Double Stacked Chicken Parmesan Sandwich, and the Make Your Own Tacos. All of these were pretty mediocre. The Chicken Parm seemed to be the winner of the bunch. We also ordered Cheese Sticks. These things were actually rather disgusting. They had what seemed like a Cheese String (those rubber cheese things you give to kids for school lunches) with a deep fried crust around it. When you bit into the cheese stick it literally had an elasticy snap to it. Beer selection is pretty mediocre but they at least had Stella on tap, which I have a feeling were pretty pricey pints though.   But in all honesty if you're just looking for a good meal, you probably wouldn't plan to come to this place anyways. You come to this place because of the games!  They've got pool tables in one area and then the rest of the building is like a Chuck E Cheese or Sega Playdium type vibe, but without any stupid little kids running around giving you a headache. They've got the classics like Skeeball and the Arcade Basketball, lots of other fun but slightly out of date games like Guitar Hero 3, Deal or No Deal and Nascar racing, and even a couple newer games like Fruit Ninja (with a fully motion activated sword for chopping fun). You play with pre-loaded game cards and each game charges different amounts of credits. Kick some ass on the games and win tickets which you can redeem for prizes. We collectively won enough tickets for 3 Dave n Busters shot glasses and a couple of candies. Not bad for an hour or so of game playing, and even if we had left empty handed it was a good time in general.  This is a good destination outing when looking for some good wholesome fun with a 19+ crowd. The one thing that sucks about this place is that its all the way out in Concord, so make sure you have a designated driver. I can't help but think that if this place was downtown it would clean up and I'd go a lot more often."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because a friend of mine was a server here, so we got a free game card.  It's basically a adult chuckee cheese. And by adult, they've just added liqour.  I'd probably come here again, but the food is just average. The nachos, though a huge portion, aren't that delicious.  I've had the boss chicken club, i really liked the \"Frazzled Onions\".  I found the mac and cheese to be super salty..  But I did really really love the Philly Rolls..  The arcade area can easily bite a hundred of more dollars out of your pocket.  Plus, it's really far from everything.  It's a great novelty place IMO.     15/15"}
{"text":"The service is pretty close to the worst I have ever seen at a restaurant. The server never came back and checked on us after taking the order. The food is good but not worth tolerating bad service. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and I especially loved their food. I wished there were more games and the area wasn't so crowded but overall it was a pleasant experience. I will be going again soon with my family."}
{"text":"17 for a macaroni and cheese They call it the Mac and cheese Bad bad and bad Only two pieces of chicken!!!! Food way over priced"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the bar/restaurant area...  I was so excited when I first found out that D&B was coming to Vegas. Locals used to be teased with the commercials on TV, when we didn't even have one here!  I never reviewed this place since my first visit because of the experiences I've had with the bar side. I've given this place so many chances to redeem themselves, but every time I come here, the same thing happens over and over. It's the main reason why I gave this joint a 3-star rating.  I understand if an eatery is busy and the staff may not always be on top of customer service, but even when it's slow? Eh... Whenever my group sits down at the open-seating area, we're always waiting. Always. Even if we sit right next to the bar, it's a waiting game.  The last time I came here to eat, I waited almost 20 minutes just to get drinks! Another 10 minutes to order food. However, the most recent visit here was much better. Our server and busser kept coming back to see if we needed anything else and how our food was. Their menu items are mostly bar-styled, but it's pretty good. No complaints there.  All in all, I don't expect much from a bar/restaurant that's connected to an arcade. I take into consideration the informality of the place, but improvements can be made. Playing the arcade games never fail though! They're just missing that horse/derby game that I see at every D&B. lol  Pro-Tips: -This place can get VERY busy on the weekends. Don't expect much when eating here on those days. You might be waiting for awhile. -Seating can be confusing. They have an open-seating area where you choose where to sit, and a secluded section where the staff leads you to a table."}
{"text":"Foods crap and the service is even worse. Happier hour is amazing though, can't beat those deals. Good for games and drinks just eat before hand and be prepared for mediocre service at the bar so get ready to wait for the bartender to stop pretending you don't exist. Cops are always there which is comforting and makes you uneasy at the same time. Place has potential, management just need to get employees who make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I like Dave and Buster's in small doses - as in a few times a year. I also make it a point to only go on Wednesdays when there are less kids, and the games are 1/2 price.  There isn't a whole lot to say about the food except it really isn't very good at all. And it's expensive. So we usually hit up the nearby In-n-Out before or one of the restaurants at Desert Ridge afterward instead. Their mixed drinks are just okay, in the end not worth what they cost.   Some of the games are fun depending on what you like. My boyfriend and I quite enjoy the Super Trivia game, skee ball, and the coin games."}
{"text":"First time at D&B, the games are amazing.  Definitely glad we came on Wednesday for 1/2 Price games.  The family had a blast!!  Food: 3 stars.. the pasta dishes were yummy: chicken Alfredo & the steak & shrimp Alfredo.  Appetizer: we ordered the buffalo wings, mozzarella stix & tater tots combo to share & that was delicious... especially the tots with the cheese, bacon & chive fixens.  The cheese could have been a little more melted instead of hard, may need to change the cheese to one that melts better.  Susannah our hostess was amazing, she took care of us!  I ordered the steak salad, although the greens & fixings were delicious, the steak could have been a better cut.  It had no flavor & was dry, even at medium, it was tough.  A flank steak would have been a better alternative (more tender, flavorful).  It is noisy from all the games that are in there but the bar is well stocked & plenty of HUGE tv screens to catch  games."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday with my wife and grandson. Was put in Chantell's area. Not sure if she is that incompetent, new, or the kitchen screwed up but ordered cheese sticks and pepperoni bread for starters and they never came until I re- ordered as we were leaving then they got it wrong. The meal was decent but had to ask for silverware and my wife's milkshake that didn't come. This place is going down hill"}
{"text":"Sorry I gotta do this to you but can't let this go unsaid. Come here all the time with my daughter. EVER single time your staff is smiling and holding open doors. So wonderful. It's unfortunate that one bad apple can ruin it for everyone that works so hard. Tonight, Shamikka (sp?) the cashier tonight was one of the most rude people I've come across in a while. Respond if you want specifics. She was also rude and argumentative with coworkers in front of guests. She should either be retrained or released. Only concerned because I pay good money to expect a good time. Not write bad comments in yelp."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday party.  Everything seem to come out all at one time, we had about 10 to 15 of us, and it all came in a timely manner. The waitress seemed a little frazzled, but she handled fine after I and my cousin lightened the mood for her a bit. The games I was impressed this time, life size rockem sockem robots, life size Pac man and space invaders as well quite impressed."}
{"text":"Dont ever go their for food or drinks or pool. Worst customer service ever. Dont know how they are still operating!"}
{"text":"Went here for a team building event with my job. So many things went wrong! Server brought out dirty dishes, a few orders were missed and brought out late, had to ask over and over for items. Just an awful dining experience with bad service and subpar food. We did have fun playing in the arcade so I would suggest stopping at Wolfgang's Pub for a bite before heading over to play games at D&B."}
{"text":"Compared to other D&Bs around the country, this one is pure crap.   Where most D&Bs have well planned, permanent eating areas (booths), this one has an empty area with a bunch of tables and chairs thrown in there. There is more comfort and ambiance at Chuck E Cheese!  The food and service here is also worse than any other D&Bs I've ever been to. I think they abducted their wait staff from McDonalds.   The games are standard, nothing special there. Overpriced as always.   I suppose if you're some drunk college kid who doesn't know any better, this place is heaven, but for the rest of us it's a waste of time and money.  P.S. I have to laugh at the dumbass who complained about the fact that there are children at an arcade! Oh the nerve!!! How dare parents bring children to an arcade!?!? Get a life snigglenuts!"}
{"text":"I've been to D&B a few times. Time before last was nice...despite lack of seating in the dining area. I had a burger, which was decent. We discovered they have Coronaritas. Now...they come in a small, non-fancy glass, but...they get the job done. Luckily I only needed one because I apparently got the last \"Coronarita lid\" so they couldn't sell any more after that. Maybe they should consider the special clips most places use. They're inexpensive and reusable. Just sayin'.  Anyway...this last Friday we went back for dinner, and some of that Coronarita action. This time we were able to get seated in the dining area. That sounds like a good thing right? Yeeeeeah...No.   We were seated in a creepy mirrored booth by an unfriendly hostess. Our menus were sticky and dirty...had to pry some of the pages apart like a high school boy's porno mag. Gross. Then...we sat. And we sat. And we watched servers walk by over and over...not even giving us a glance...for well over 10 minutes. We made our drink and dinner decisions...and nobody came to take an order. So...we finally just left and had a fabulous steak dinner at The Keg. :)    So...I generously give 2 stars because the first visit was okay. That second time though...only good thing about it was that we got to discover a very tasty steakhouse and try something new due to the lack of...well...anything besides being seated."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's seems to be one of those places that is a HIT or MISS! I unfortunately got the MISS this past weekend. I was excited for Las Vegas to finally get a location because it was so annoying to see the commercials on TV for a place that didn't even exist in my city ugh!  My godson wanted to have himself a \"big boy\" party here so of course we made that happen! The staff.. Wow what can I say I just have to say that the employee's you hire for your business play such a crucial roll and will help make or break your establishment. The staff here have to be some of the worst I've ever encountered in terms of one of these \"Eat & Play\" kind of places. I'm from California and have been to that location several times, never experienced the poor service we got this weekend. When I arrived to the party it was after it started and of course it was a madhouse in here. I stood at the front for at least 7 minutes while two of the hostess girls talked with what looked like was either a friend or an employee. Do that on your own time darling you are working. What made matters even worst was the fact they both looked at me and just kept on talking.. Oh okay.. Finally somebody from off the floor asked me \"Are you here for a birthday party\" I replied with the name of my godson and she says with an attitude \"Which one there's 3 by that name and what's his age\" I just walked off and decided to find the party myself.  Fast forward to the party area. The food that is offered is sorry as ever. My best friend was so disappointed with the amount of money that was spent for such low quality food. We would've been better buying some food from the frozen food aisle at the store heating it up, putting it in some foil and distributing it ourselves! These pizza bite things were gross and the chicken fingers were dry, burgers were I hope burger's lol list goes on. Just a fail. The server that worked our party poor thing, she wasn't even the original one that was assigned. We had another one who mysteriously just disappeared. Not sure if she just got overwhelmed with our large party size but seemed a bit unprofessional to just bounce like that with no word! After we paid they pretty much kicked us out of the table and gave us one of those \"You don't gotta go home, but you gotta get the hell up outta here\" speeches. NO problem. As we were leaving, well attempting to leave there was a lockdown on the place because of a missing child. They have a procedure where nobody can leave when a child is missing. Interesting I'd like to understand this concept because it's odd.  All in all it was borderline terrible. The only thing that was good was my \"Tres Patron\" drink from the bar. The adults ordered alcoholic beverages and my mom got the watermelon margarita which was pretty awesome because the ice cubes were actually watermelons! It's odd here that you pay for the drink before you even get to taste it but that's whatever. Hopefully when I try this place out on a different occasion I can update my review and provide a much better experience."}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience.It was all bad from the beginning. We get there and no tables are available.We agreed to wait. After an hour wait. My friend goes and ask if there are any tables.The girl finally places us on a table. The waiter takes our drink order and we wait for 20 minutes for just two cokes.An additional 30 minutes to get our actual plates.Waiter did not provide us with silverware. We had to request some. At this point I was so fed up. My friend had to get up to go ask for help to get us our checks.Worst customer service ever. The waiter made it clear she could careless.I would not recommend this place for dinning.Games were good but that was about it. Ruined my night!"}
{"text":"Not very good management.  You have a football game that could decide a national champion in LSU and Alabama. And all you have on is the fight  not everyone is a fight fan. You charge a cover but didn't post it or announce it. So sad."}
{"text":"Awful food , awful service , super loud! For starters I understand it's an arcade atmosphere but right where you're eating someone gets on the mic to call Those who have requested a pool table and it's just a lot. It would be better if this was done in another area. I ordered a simple soup and salad . Once my food came Out without a spoon I asked for  a spoon. I waited about 15 minutes for a spoon so my soup was called by then and I didn't even want it anymore.  My daughter ordered fries and pretzel dogs. They were super greasy and it looked like they just threw the fries on the plate.  I have been here before during a week day afternoon and it was much better. Maybe they just aren't good with heavier crowds."}
{"text":"I like how they have 10 pin bowling. Great drinks at the three different bars. Two restaurants. Lots of new video games. A pool table room that has shuffle board. Upstairs on the balcony you can smoke. Food is good. I like how you can get a 10-15 dollar meal or pay 24 for it and get a 20 buck play card.  Servers are all friendly. Why I only rated it a four star is they constantly forget food sides or whatnot. Actually every restaurant does. So I shouldn't complain. No restaurant is perfect. So actually gonna give them a five star as games, food, and drinks are awesome. It's a fun place to go with family, friends or on a first date."}
{"text":"Food is whatevers, drinks the same. However, this DnB compared to the one in Tempe is much better if your'e really just interested in getting some game time in. The on at Tempe Marketplace is crazy busy, like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy. When I go to an arcade and am already dropping 20+ bucks to play games I want that gaming experience to be nonstop. However, the drive is really far for someone that lives in Gilbert... so that's really the only reason why it gets a 4 star."}
{"text":"I use to go to Dave & Busters all the time and I literally mean all the time.  I've often grab lunch there and hit up their pool tables.  However I haven't been there in years and some of my friends apparently enjoy frequenting the place.  We decided to go there to hang out for the night and grab some drinks and play some games.  I admit a couple of the games were actually pretty fun, but most of them were really overpriced.  But that's not really what my review is based on.  My review is based on the bar service specifically.  My friend and I stood at the bar and waited for someone to look at us, acknowledge our existence or at least show you see us.  I've had this happen at plenty of bars and clubs before, I get it that you're busy and even if you see us you have to service those who came first.  I'm pretty okay waiting my turn, however after others were serviced two of the bartenders on our side walked away and started counting receipts and doing other random things.  There were two completely different bartenders that were way on the other side of the bar that looked at us and then looked at their two coworkers with a look on their face as if they wondered if anyone would help us or if they'd get stuck helping us and picking up their lazy coworkers slack.  I felt bad for the other two bartenders as you could see them running around like crazy doing the bulk of the work while the other two did get drinks but seemed to pick and choose who they serviced instead of first come first serve.  I only had 2 drinks and it took me a combined total of 30 minutes to get those two drinks with all the time I stood there.  That doesn't include when I was ready to cash out I had to wait an additional 10 minutes until a bartender that never helped me walked over completely annoyed.  Let me clarify she wasn't annoyed me with, but I could see her eyes burning holes into her coworkers heads.  It's really hard writing this review because I want to give the games a 3 star review, and I want to give the two bartenders that were doing a bulk of the work good reviews.  I even wanted to catch their names so I could write into the company and let them know how outstanding their two bartenders were and how great they were at carrying their lazier coworkers load on their backs.  It was so bad that their were receipts all over the counter tops.  They were wet and sticky everywhere.  It wasn't just me and my friend that had to wait forever because people standing next to us were upset at the wait as well, although they somehow received service before us.  I did see a few people move from the side we were on to the other side with the more attentive bartenders.  My only hope is that management reads this and talks to their employees about team work.  A great man once said, \"Very few burdens in life are heavy if everyone lifts.\"  It should never be a few people carrying the team and really everyone should be pulling together to get the job done."}
{"text":"It's ok. I went with a group recently and we waited an exceptionally long time, but I felt sufficient effort was made to leave us happy customers. It's a fun place to hang out when there's nothing else exciting going on in town or when you just want a low key evening. Great for kids during the day, but it's definitely for adults in the evening."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good and their really good at giving free credits when necessary it's not about how many negative experience but how they fixed them. Me and my son went and apparently the systems shut down and nothing worked but the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating I came back a week later and they everything right."}
{"text":"Going to this Dave and Busters on a Saturday night will be the biggest mistake you make... ever.   After being there last night (a Saturday) I have decided I will never return again. Besides it being very crowded, at a point the entire kitchen was down and not able to serve food for an event they had. Though that didn't effect me personally, it's just the beginning of the issue.   Firstly, 30 minutes to do coat check.   After paying $30 each person in my group of 6 for the promotion they had going on, we entered the game room to find line ups for the games.. this was because 60% of the machines were NOT WORKING. When I say 60% I am hardly exaggerating, so many of the games were out of order.   Next issue was the washrooms. From the moment I got there at around 9pm, the washrooms were in a very disgusting and sad state. No one went in there all night to check the cleanliness which is concerning when you are operating a restaurant. I was told by a male friend that he approached management regarding the men's washrooms, and the manager replied \"sorry, there's nothing I can do about it right now.\"  I believe when you have food in your establishment, the cleanliness of every aspect should be of utmost importance."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed and if I could give a zero star review I would. We had to ask our waiter for our drinks, refills for our drinks and talk to the manager to actually get our refills. Our waiter never came to check on us or give us our check. We had to ask someone else to get our check and then he had to have us help him figure out our check.  For the cost of what we paid ($82 plus tip), I find it unacceptable to have the service be so terrible. And the manager did not even apologize for the service. He gave my husband a free beer but did not correct the rest of the bad service. We will not be back here and I will tell everyone I know to not waste their time or money here. 2 1/2 hours of our day wasted on a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"worst service wver i asked for someone to come over 3 times and we sat at a table for 20 minutes while a whole swarm of servers were just walking around passing us. not to mention alllll the tables in the whole game room were dirty. even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us. drinks took forever too and it wasnt busy at all the bartenders didn't care much they stood there for awhile. we will still go here just not try to eat. they need some structure in the work atmosphere."}
{"text":"This last time we were here, was 3 months ago for my nieces birthday party with all her girlfriends. Started off in the bowling alley area, which is located on the lower level. My sister got bowling for the girls (12), endless amounts of pitchers of soda, hamburgers, chicken bites and french fries. I don't know if that is a package or not but i know they have other packages, see attached pdf i found. The was plenty of attention from the servers and very helpful with getting the bowling started. The girls had a really good time, i know my sister is really glad that she chose Dave & Busters. After the bowling the girls ran upstairs to use the coins we gave them. They had a blast and even more fun trying to decide what to get with all of their tickets they got.  4 stars because the cost of this place was nuts. They have a pretty good racket going on here, the kids love it! This place is great for groups of people, and lots of kids."}
{"text":"I went here a few times back when it was still Jillians. It's changed alot now that it's Dave and Busters. I've been to this location twice now that it's Dave and Busters.   December 2011 visit: We had an office work party on a Friday night this past December. We planned the event only a month beforehand, so our choices were limited where our table could be. It was either the bowling lanes downstairs or the table upstairs right in the heart of all the video gaming. If you plan to have an office party/event here, now I know that you plan a few months in advance. December gets to be a really busy time for holiday parties, so no procrastinating!   I didn't expect much from the food at a game place, but i was pleasantly surprised. You cannot go wrong with the make your own taco plate. They serve the taco plate - fajita style, so you get your flour/corn tortillas with separate toppings on a a platter. Since I ordered mine with shrimp, which come on a skewer, I didn't feel so over-bloated that I couldn't play games. The artichoke dip was a good appetizer. There's even an appetizer that combines beef sliders with hot wings so you don't have to make a choice between the two. The sliders aren't amazing, but they are good.   April 2012 visit: Although back in December, for the office holiday party, it wasn't too crowded around 7pm, when I returned for my husband's birthday (well the day after his birthday) on April 14th, on a Saturday, the place was super packed! When I called the restaurant beforehand to see if it was crowded on Saturday night, the hostess said it wouldn't be a problem to seat 6 of us around 7-ish, but boy was she wrong.We had to wait a whole hour after we got there at 7pm to get seated at the restaurant downstairs. After dinner (close to 9:30pm), there was a line wrapping all the way to the stairs just to get game cards. It was too crowded to move anywhere since there were kids running everywhere with their parents. It was sheer pandemonium! We still had fun, but expect huge crowds on Saturday nights. Maybe Friday is a better time to go? Even Thursday would be better if you don't have to work the next day..."}
{"text":"What can ya say about food, drinks, games, and prizes! Good things! I gave a three stars for the following reasons:  1.) Came into the dining room on the first floor with a party of 12 (mind you we called ahead), ordered drinks & appetizers that didn't take too long to come out. Nachos, calamari, and atrichoke dip... they were okay - average. Drinks... I ordered the Watermelon Coronita-Margarita drink which was pretty delicious, it is a definite must try. Comes with your own little bottle of Coronita flipped upsidedown in a Margarita. Also tried the Banana Split drink. This drink is DELISH!   2.) Ordered dinner.... Most of the entrees came out in a timely fashion. Except my Mom's. She ordered the Bacon-Wrapped Sirloin Medallions & Grilled Shrimp Skewer things - they took at least 10 minutes longer to come out, I had to go request for a Manager because the Waitress wasn't checking in with us about it at all. (She's another story...down the line.) Mom finally gets her order, asked for it medium-rare, and it comes out rare. I mean rare. I'm surprised it was cooked-looking on the outside! She sends it back, asks for medium. It comes back out another ten minutes later... it's well done. She takes a few bites. It's not good. She's had enough, over it. I send it back for her, ask for it to be removed from the bill.  3.) Waiting....waiting.... where's the waitress?? Have you seen her? For the beginning of our arrival, she was attentive. Towards the end, mind you the dining area is less busy than it was when we got there, she was just not around. Oh there she is, finally! Can we have our bill?....Wait another ten minutes... Okay we don't even want to look at it just take it, swipe it, lessgo play games... At least she was nice? Took a couple family pics for us!  4.) Games were fun. They have a new Star Wars pod that you MUST TRY. Most of the games were up and running. There were only a few that were down. Warning: the \"beer pong\" game is always breaking down. Just don't. Just. Don't.  Other than that it was a fun time!"}
{"text":"Found out that they have dancing on the roof top from a friend. A few days later, We grabbed a bite to eat at this location. Usually I find them too loud but that was not an issue. Great overall experience."}
{"text":"This was really not the experience I had hoped for.  We celebrated my daughter's birthday with the family.  We had the slowest service, and the food was cold.  None of our requests were followed and we had to ask again.  Philly burger was missing onions!  Cheap amount of fries, kids meals very chintzy on the fries and kids burger was a joke. Typical time for request to be met was 15 minutes.  Almost 5 dollars for an icee in a very small glass and no refills.  A clear rip off...don't bother.  Bathrooms were disgustingly dirty with toilet tissue and paper towels all over the floor and over flowing garbage cans.  I have been a server in my lifetime and never moved as slow as this girl did.  It was my first time here and it will definitely be my last!  While it is a unique experience I don't believe they value their clientele."}
{"text":"My review pertains mostly to the dining section of the venue.   It was bad. I had a big group of 16 and when trying to make reservations, we were told that they don't accept reservations and that it would be first come-first serve. To my surprise, when I walked in, I was told that the wait would be over an hour for a table of 16. What made it worse was that I looked into the dining room and both the bar and dining area was well below capacity and they could have definitely taken us right away. When we asked about the empty tables, the staff member simply told us that that section was not his responsibility and said there was nothing he could do about it. The customer service was horrible.   Two hours later, at nearly 10:30 (they close at midnight), we were finally served. We all ordered the eat and play deals - I had the Chicken and Shrimp Rockafeller (which was really good). Unfortunately, the satisfaction I got from my meal was overshadowed by the fact that by the time we were all finished our meals, it was already 11:30, which left us only 30 minutes to play in the arcade section.  Definitely not the experience I expected."}
{"text":"Zero stars this time.  Gave this trashey place a 2nd chance on my kids birthday.  Discovered on the app if I get a power card, I get 20.00 worth of free game tokens.  Well not this day.  I asked for a power card at the desk, he asked me how much I wanted to put on the card.  I replied, I wanted to do 20 to get the free 20 on the app.  He said ok, just pay here, then go on the app.  Liar!! I tried and he said it doesnt work that way.  I got upset, he rolled his little eyes and told 3 othet pointless employees to get a manager who never asked me ( as usual). Not any of the 3 employees.cared.  i was in the service buss for 15 yrs.  This place should cater to toddlers.  You employee morons who explain nothing and could care less about the customer.  Bartender was nice."}
{"text":"The food was awful. I understand I can't always expect what's pictured on the menu to actually show up at the table. But this was the biggest discrepancy from menu to table I've ever seen. You'd be better off sneaking in a pb&j and playing some games. The food was embarrassing and insulting."}
{"text":"I have a child with a severe dairy allergy, and eating out is always a challenge. Every time I have gone to D and B, the manager comes out with the meal to check and make sure that it is done to our specifications. That makes our experience so much better, and we are relaxed and having fun!  The gaming area is always clean. Our kids love it here."}
{"text":"I have had bad service in my time, but this place takes the cake. My friend and I were the ONLY 2 people at the bar at approx midnight, and the bartender looked at us 3 times without acknowledging, and still took over 7 minutes to come over to us. Now I know 7 minutes doesn't sound like a long time, but when you are the ONLY people at the bar COME ON. He actually had to intentionally ignore us to give that poor of service. The selection of games was very limited and boring. I would not recommend this establishment. Maybe if you have kids, but it advertises as a playground for adults. GO Figure"}
{"text":"My son and I came here for some Spring Break fun. Staff was helpful and when my son questioned the prize redeemer why we didn't receive 500 tickets, they called a manager. The manager clearly explained why we didnt We ate lunch and our server was friendly. We received our pizza quesadilla promptly. Thanks for the fun!"}
{"text":"Games = Fun & good for the kids. Nothing special. Cool games for the kids.  Service = Good. Smiles & quick service.  Food = Horrible. We ordered a bunch of appetizers - the calamari was terrible. It was like 25% calamari, 25% fried onions & 50% fried peppercinis. Honestly really bad food. Rest of the food was really plain. I wouldn't come back simply because of that. Not good."}
{"text":"It is really hard to rate this Dave & Buster's.I am going to rate it a 2 and that is because of the exceptional service of Trevor in the dining area.Trevor has a one of a kind personality and we truly enjoyed his energy and humor as our server.He is definitely a jewel in customer service!!  On the other hand,we came here to bowl and could not.There were three lanes not working and the rest were occupied.I can understand one lane but three lanes not operating is not acceptable,particularly for a business that is popular on a Saturday night.  The restroom!!Words cannot explain how disgusted I was with the upkeep of this area.Every single stall was disgusting for various reasons that I will not go into detail about,there were wet paper towels all over the floor by the sinks,the trash was piled high,and the counter top covered in water.In my mind I thought,geesh I know an employee or a manager had to have come in here by now to use the restroom because this condition can't be created in one hour.For the sake of business and sanitation,I hope management addresses this concern."}
{"text":"Can we get a maintenance man?  And a janitor?  And a manager?   No?  Ok...  I had a good time at Dave and Buster's, but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue.   We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn't find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.     All but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).     And we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).  Overall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I'd try a different location for sure."}
{"text":"An update to this review.  After all this happened, the event organizers complained to the corporate office.  Apparently, the follow up to this was that the manager who was leading the charge on doing this was fired.  Good riddance."}
{"text":"It's like Chuck-e-Cheeses, but with booze.  This place has a lot of fun things from arcade games to pool. I love this place and I'd like my birthday to be there...or a close friend!"}
{"text":"The games are fun! What I'm going to gripe about is the food. My boyfriend and I just moved down here and used to go to a Taco Tuesday up in Wa. Sometimes I'd go with my brother. They had $.50 tacos so we were able to stuff ourselves silly - I could even afford to buy dinner!   We were excited to see that D&B was having a Taco Tuesday, and then we got there, ordered 4 tacos @ $1.00 each, and they came out all on one plate. They offered no other plates, so we were essentially eating off a trough in the middle of the table. Waitress was like \"can I get you anything else?\" I thought, how about a couple little plates.  That's not all though. They literally had a mere pinch of cheese in each taco! WtF?!?!?! The meat didn't taste like it had any taco seasoning in it. The tacos were dripping grease, like it hadn't even been drained from the meat. I'm all for a greasy taco experience IF and only if there's enough stuff in the taco to make it worth all that grease. Otherwise? Gross!   This place gets one point for the games, one for having an upstairs bar (rather awesome), and one point for the chocolate fondue dish. This dessert (which we had on another night than Taco Tuesday) was truly yummy and we probably could've had it as our main course because it was so filling. Not entirely unhealthy, either as they had fruit along with the other stuff to dip in the chocolate.  For Taco Tuesday, we'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I believe we got served 'tainted alcohol', the same kind tourists in Mexican resorts were served.  We came here on a Thursday night and each ordered one drink.  I felt immediately bad after an hour and was feeling poisoned the next day.  My lover is of German ancestry and holds her liquor well.  However after one drink, she was feeling bad the next day.  This does not happen to her.  On another note, the games seem fun to play but were rather expensive.  The whole place seemed rather empty on Thursday night.  Maybe we should have taken a clue.  Update 12/10/2017: I received several message responses from other patrons who had similar experiences."}
{"text":"Go for the dinner and game special and add some extra points-they go fast. The food as always been pretty good(about the same as Fridays) I love killing vampires in the arcade. Wish they brought back The Shock Chair."}
{"text":"First time at D&Bs!!! Spent over $70 on the arcade. Perhaps that it's a Monday afternoon. The place is not packed with ppl and i felt so relaxed but excited at the same time. The staff are nice. Got some good prizes with 2000+ tickets. I would love to visit other D&Bs again!!!"}
{"text":"Its a newer location. I went on opening night. It was like a regular dave and busters. I thought since it was opening night they would of had some opening deals or discounts but they didnt. That sucks. Saw alot of kids here .. id prefer the location in concord mills. Much bigger. Nonetheless good customer service, clean, and good location..."}
{"text":"Love the mix of games here! Time crisis 5 is my new favorite, but I do love first person shooter games! They have games for kids and big kids like me! This is a great date spot!"}
{"text":"Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it.   Dining: 2 stars  I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait.   When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.  The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.  Bar: 1 Star  Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.  Arcade: 4 Stars  There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.   Overall: 3 Stars  If you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the very first time with my entire family... we didn't make a reservation but we were seated with no problems whatsoever. The food wasn't the absolute best, but they had deals on certain meals you order you can get a certain amount of points towards play. The server was sweet and she tended to all of our individual needs. When we came in it was very packed in the dining area and she was also a waitress for a group of 100. I think she did very well considering that fact.  The arcade area is absolutely great! My family usually goes to gameworks and buys the groupon deals... $20 for the cards. I think the gaming is better over here considering that they were all working and we didn't have issues. It's not as packed. Will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"A table for 16 please...   That is what I had to ask for and knew that D&B could accomodate.  I happen to be in the Homestead area for work.   I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the \"Shock and Awe\" they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.  When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.  We decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.  It is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.  The waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.  It was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.  My team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   They seemed pleased.  Service - very good Food - okay, not great.   My meal was $13 Ambiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&B  There are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close.  I would definitely recommend another in Squirrel Hill - I suggest you use Yelp to find you a better one (then come back and play! ;-) )"}
{"text":"My best friend decided to have his birthday here.  It was alright.  Didn't suck nor was it exceptional.  Nothing memorable.  Most likely will forget that I came here for my best friend's birthday.  Next year we will think \"Where the hell did we go last year?\"."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok there wings were really hot and I liked that but the people at the store were all grumpy and rude I will not be going there again"}
{"text":"Food and games great.  Service kind of slow or this place (for it's genre) could have been rated higher. The wife and I had a good time.  Drinks are $$$$"}
{"text":"The server here Dave and buster in AZ in glendale suck, the customer service is not so good. We are visiting  for California and service is not so good here. I wood not come here again. For the amount of money food . Cost me $25.00 each."}
{"text":"First off i work in a very nice restaurant full time    There needs to be a serious management change for this location.   4 servers for the whole restaurant is unacceptable. We waited 20 mins for a drink order. 20 mins to get the drinks I could see at the BAR \"we grabbed them from the bartender\" one drink order was not even put in to the bartender by our waiter   food was All cold, and the salad was warm after waiting 45 for the order to be delivered  The waiter didn't even ask how the meal was, only come back to drop our check off  Horrible experience overall!  Ended up paying there bartender and tipping her instead for being the most helpful."}
{"text":"I'm being pretty generous with my rating. Our experience at this DB was not ideal.  Our group of 4 had a one hour wait for dinner (Sunday, got there around 5pm) - which is completely fine because there's an arcade that can fill up the time. We were able to use the Facebook grand opening coupon, which allowed us 200 tickets for only $22 (good deal!). The game selections were also pretty fun, so it was a good way to kill time.  We were notified twice that our table was ready - 12 min apart. We were very appreciative that they even waited that long before giving our table away, so there's that! Service was average. Our server, Mikaela (?), was polite, friendly, and seemed to know the menu well.   I specifically ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp with lobster sauce & fire-grilled sirloin (menu description: seasoned, fire-grilled 5 oz. sirloin steak and large grilled shrimp wrapped with applewood smoked bacon served with garlic mashed potatoes, garlic green beans and creamy lobster sauce). Instead of mashed potatoes, I requested extra garlic green beans. Easy peasy!   We waited about 30 minutes before my husband and friends' food arrived (burgers and sliders). Sadly, my food took another 25 minutes to arrive - and the order wasn't quite correct. I was given a very dry piece of steak, on top of mashed potatoes, topped with crunchy spinach. What? I was too hungry to have it returned, so I ate the shrimp and steak, my husband ate the potatoes. It was completely disappointing. I didn't even get my soda refill - server took my glass to fill it, but never returned with my drink.    The manager, Ace (?), provided me with 4 game playing cards and comped our entire meal. We also received multiple apologies about the unacceptable service. We appreciated that, and I'm not bitter about it - I get that they were busy, but that was a complete screw up by kitchen staff. My husband and friends thought their food was dry, indicating they might have been sitting there for a while before being sent to our table.  Nonetheless, we're willing to give this place another chance mainly for the games and the prizes we need to redeem. We'll likely try this place to eat when it's not too busy, but come on - step up your game!"}
{"text":"This was the worst night ever.  My 10 year old son was treated rudely by a terrible costumer on the arcade floor (when he tried to kindly show the a nasty woman where the card comes out of the machine she said to the man with her: \"The kid thinks he can get my card.\"  I told my son that was rude and he shouldn't be quiet about such behavior. She pretended not to hear me. Then she took her time and played at least 5 more rounds. I have patience and we waited. My son played one round and then she came back with the man accompanying her. Pushed me away and said she wanted to play with my kid. That's creepy. I said he doesn't want to play with you, since you were rude to him.  Then she said: that's sexist! When someone doesn't know what sexist means, it's embarrassing. For them.  Then I said please allow him to play, since he waited for you to play several rounds. And I told her when you don't know when and where to use the term \"sexist\" don't use it. Then she said: \"Says the big fat lady.\" My son was so upset at the point and I went to the manager and told her she needs to deal with this much insult. The management did nothing to help.  She offered free points to my son. That's not how I deal with problems, and that's not how I want to teach the right behavior to my kid. I said no, and insisted on her taking care of the mess. She said I'll go talk to them. She didn't. She want intimidated or didn't want to or whatever her deal was. She stood next to me and tried to apologize for them! So she wouldn't have to go talk to nasty woman and the man accompanying her. I took out my phone to look up Dave and Buster's phone or anything on their website to file a complaint. I didn't have my glasses on and had to hold the phone farther. The man with her started taking pictures of me! I wasn't even facing them. I told her I don't want my pictures in his phone. She talked to him. He said I did it first. The manager believed him! Just beautiful! The Metro officers on the floor where useless. They told me this is the company's private property and they can't do anything! The manager said go to the other side of the floor so you don't see them! Seriously?!   Here is the great ending; I asked her if I'm not white enough to be treated equally and fairly. The she asked us to leave. The Metro officers said I had to leave since the manager asked me to. The entire time the sick nasty woman was playing and laughing at me and my son.  I won't let this go. That manager needs to see the consequences of such poor decisions.  If you have similar experiences please share."}
{"text":"It's a nice arcade... Good amount of video games and not selling out on redemption entirely. Food isn't great but TV coverage is good. Games are expensive but I guess so is the rent on the place   I will keep this 5 star review as long as you keep Pump it up!! haha"}
{"text":"Went here at the request of my son for his birthday. My youngest son has been dying to go to this since it opened. So, when his birthday rolled around, we decided we'd go. We purposely went in the middle of a Monday afternoon to avoid crowds.   This place is so overpriced for what you're actually getting. The food was awful. I got a burger that was shaped in a perfect circle, indicating it was simply a frozen patty that was heated up. It was the most bland burger I've ever had. The fries weren't bad. My husband and one of my sons had the Philly cheese steak sandwiches. They complained the cheese sauce was super salty. They would have preferred real cheese. My husband said it wasn't terrible but way overpriced for what it was. My daughter had chicken fingers and again, she said they were ok but not worth the price. The prices are steep for what amounts to bowling alley food.   The games are fun but the cards are pricey and you have to spend a lot to earn a substantial amount of tickets that earn you cheap crap. Everything in the store could be purchased somewhere else for much less. My kids each got $20 gaming cards and racked up some tickets. One of my kids spent all their tickets on an umbrella hat and some candy. So, $20 for an umbrella hat and candy. I can buy an umbrella hat for $5 on Amazon and the candy for like a $2 tops. So, we spent $20 for $7 worth of junk. You could argue there is value in the fun that was had from playing the games. But there are several arcades around the valley that offer that kind of entertainment for a much better price.   My son is happy that he got to check it out. It was fine one time. But I seriously do not see us returning.  I gave two stars because the staff was very friendly and our waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"We had a great time here! Food was above average, service was decent, and the restaurant was clean. After some drinks and food we took the kids up stairs to play some games  and they went nuts. They have games for all ages, and do the whole ticket thing that the kids love so they can get their little toys at the end.  The bowling ally down stairs is nice. It kind of has a constant cosmic bowl thing going on. The bar area by the bowling ally looks well stocked and has a cool 50's theme going on. If you get there in time for happy hour mixed drinks were half price.  Games = Happy kids Half off mixed drinks = Happy wife Cold Beer and Sports on TV = Happy ME  It just had something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Yay, I'm fan only of the arcade section. DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU LIKE CARDBOARD FOOD...IKEA IS NEXT DOOR BETTER OPTIONS/PRICING. Okay so now we cleared that up back to my games area review. this place has ALOT of games to get the best gaming experience go on Wednesdays for Half Price All day. I noticed on this day only more games are in working order. My favorite games is the SpongeBob coin toss and the Star Trek Rapid Fire Coin Toss. Between these two games they are fun and get you collecting some cards for a chance to win thousands of tickets for prizes. Other games worth mentioning are Mario Kartz drive, shooting 3d games, throw ball, basketball games. You can definitely have fun here. Get one of the special tier cards $56 power play for best value, Be aware you have to pay tax on top which i think is stupid but it is what it is. Overall you will have a good time."}
{"text":"I had no idea you could host kids parties here, but that's awesome.   Why?   Because it's better than the punishment that is Chuck-e whats-his-name. They have a bar and adult things to keep you busy. They also have private rooms you can rent out and they'll stream Cartoon Network on the big screen--it will make your kids literally loose their minds.   I'm not sure how much the food costs, especially for a larger party in a private room, but it seems pretty standard. You know, big-chain frozen foods prettied up to look fresh. Meh. But if you go there to play games with the kids, like we did, this place is money.   Speaking of, you seem to get more for your money with their charge cards. The idea is to find the games that give you the most tickets. That way your kiddo can grab something cool from the shop when it's time to go.   Overall, this isn't a place I'd seek out to spend time at with adults, but for a group of kids it seems like a great deal. And if you have a few beers, you won't feel the big-box monster eating your soul."}
{"text":"Food and service were totally sub-par. For an establishment this size they should have a full staff of competent servers, rather than a staff full of high school students who could care less about their jobs. Waited 40 minutes for soggy nachos. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place it's so much fun! I'm guessing they have over 200+ games to choose from.  Always have weekday specials & you get the inside scoop when you sign up for their emails.  The first time you  sign up for their emails you'll get $10 on your next visit ! Which is pretty cool.    Taco Tuesday's are delicious & fun $2 tacos chicken or beef  $2 corona & corona light   The tacos are actually really yummy ! Who would have thought !   I enjoy being my boys here because mom can play too & maybe if in the mood have an adult snow cone or their signature purple people eater which is layered with Stoli Ohranj, HYPNOTIQ, island pucker & cranberry juice !! Yum   Remember to bring your play card to load chips on if not it'll cost you an extra $2   Wednesday's are half price bowling & 1/2 price games  Enjoy gaming fellow YELPERS"}
{"text":"yay for dave and busters.   my wife took me here for a \"pre\" birthday celebration. we only intended to stay an hour or so...because if you're not careful, the spending can rack up at D&B's before you know it.  fast forward 3 hours later and we had to pull ourselves away from some skeeball.  the happy hour specials brought us in. they actually have some pretty good drink specials from 4-7pm for happy hour. i had 2 million dollar margaritas. they were very refreshing and weren't at all soppy sweet mixy tasting. i thought they jipped me on the tequila until i started my second one and i could feel the delicious tequila buzz hitting my fingertips.   we split the make your own shrimp soft taco plate. a hearty meal with 4 tortillas and an assortment of fixins...black beans, rice, guac, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, salsa, and shrimp. i thought they were darn tasty.   then off to the arcade where we played video games...something we only do at D&B's, thus we lose quite quickly and quite often. i love the zombie shoot em ups, the race cars and the air hockey. my gal loves skee ball probably because i suck at it. oh and whack-a-mole...scored serious tickets on that.   there are numerous shoot em up games, basketball, and tons of those fair games where you try to roll a token into an impossibly difficult contraption in order to knock more tokens into a slot to get more tokens...argh, it's too difficult to explain. in the end, you spend about 40 dollars to get tickets in exchange for a glass you could've simply bought at the store for 50cents.   but that's no fun, however, Dave and Busters IS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday night and the whole place was understaffed. 1 bartender for each bar and 1 barback for both bars. Manager just walking around not doing crap while the bartender was so weeded that it took me 27 minutes to get a second round .... yes I counted. Place would be awesome if it was ran right."}
{"text":"Never and I mean NEVER come here during golden knights game days! The EMPLOYEES DO NOT KNOW HOW TO WORK WHILE CUSTOMERS WANT TO DINE AND RELAX WATCHING THE GAME. The employees are to busy watching the game, food came out over cooked, most likely the cooks were busy watching the game too. This establishment was garbage! Will not be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I love the arcade games that Dave & Busters have, my first time being at the California locations. Knowing that one in Summerlin opened up, I was really excited to finally be able to go to D&B without having to vacay to Cali. The main reason why I am giving them a 1 star is because of their customer service, the main priority an establishment like this place should focus on.  My first night being at this location, I was really pumped! Drinks, food and arcade games. Where can you go wrong? Turns out, I was. The bar was straight up packed during happy hour (9pm-closing), and it took a while to get our drink orders in AND to get the drinks, roughly about 30 mins. But the bartender, Sean, was able to tend to multiple customers, including a small party of three of me and my two friends while everyone was shouting at him to get some drink orders in. Way to stay calm and cool, Sean. Four for you, Glenn Coco. After playing a couple of games and got some drinks, we decided to put our name on the waiting list for the restaurant to grab a small bite to eat before heading back on the floor. I don't remember our server's name but she was friendly. The only problem was she didn't know anything that was on happy hour and that there were certain appetizers that were on happy hour when we asked her these questions. That's something a server should definitely know to further better your guests experience. The food came at a timely manner. We ordered the sliders wings and fries appetizer platter and the nachos along with their $2 tacos but the food was ehhh. But it filled our stomachs up. After eating, we went back out on the floor and over the intercom, they give a shout saying its last call for games. Literally, it was last call. The minute it turns midnight, they shut them boys off like they lost electricity in the building. Had fun but the employees didn't make anything better except for our boy Sean.  Second night we came in, we came with a bigger party of roughly about 8 or 9 of us. It was a Wednesday and on Wednesdays, it's half price on the games the entire day. Half prices on games drinks and food? Yessir. So shout outs for that but whoever wants to come this day, prepare for it to be busy. We got to the bar roughly around 9pm exact just to get that happy hour price. Another bartender, Alfred, was up for the challenge.  It took him a while to get to us because of everyone constantly shouting drink orders. The time was now 930pm when he did get to us. We ordered roughly about 10+ drinks and it only came to about 50 bucks. That's deals. But the drinks did take another 15 minutes for them to reach us. So we lost 45 mins of playing time. We also decided to put our name on the waiting list because we wanted to get some food again, this time trying out different items and getting that happy hour pricing. They quoted our party about 20-30 mins. We were shocked that it was quoted so little, being a party of 9 and with how busy the entire D&B was. Every table was taken. So we were skeptical. Guess what? We were right. It took 2+ hours to finally get us a table AFTER checking in every 30 mins on the status for our table. So we couldn't even really get to enjoy playing games since we were expecting to be called soon and end up being seated at roughly 11pm. We were seated and our server was Daisy. For the most part, she was very friendly and nice. Wasn't overwhelmed with our party and was really calm when we placed our orders, having split checks and everything. When we ordered drinks from her though, she had to check our IDs. Normal protocol. But two of our friends had vertical IDs, one of them being a 23 year old and the other, freshly turned 21 for a couple weeks. She must of thought his ID was fake as Daisy had to double check with a manager to make sure the ID was legit because it was vertical. Hrmmmm. That's not right. Why not take both IDs then? Not just one. And in addition to that, when she took another 3 of our friends IDs, she said \" I don't know which one of you guys is which, you guys all look the same.\" Yes, we are all Asian. BUT NONE OF US LOOKED THE SAME ONE BIT. No relation to each other at all! And she came to me with the 3 IDs and was looking at all 3 of them while looking at me to see if I was one of the IDs. She didn't even take my ID. She checked it earlier and didn't take mine away. Fishy to me. Food came out and we were last called it being around 1130-1145 ish. Wouldn't have happened if we'd known we'd be seated so late. To top the night off, another employee who may have been the manager told us, \"I know you guys are having fun but unfortunately, we are closed and you guys have to leave.\" We didn't even finish our drinks and they were all full. AND when we got them so late. AND we didn't even get our cards back from paying the bill. Time for us to leave.   D&B. Please change your definition of great quality customer service."}
{"text":"We were here last night for date night. We had so so much fun! Our server (Jasmine?) was a delight and her drink recommendations were right on target. Our food was delicious and too much for one portion. We did the Eat and play passes, so after dinner we played games for a few hours and had a blast! The bartender, Myke, is a beast back there. We were impressed watching him keep up with the demand of the bar and the dining area. He customized my drink for me, because of my rum hatred... And it was fantastic. This was a fantastic date night, and we will be back for the fun again."}
{"text":"Wow.. The service here is deplorable, I don't know if I've ever been so disrespected  before at any bar. One of the bartenders spilled a bottle of jäger and doused me with some booze without so much as an apology. Not to mention it took maybe 12-15 minutes just to get a beer after sitting down at the bar.. The only thing that brings me back here is that I have no choice with the lack of arcades for the kids.. Once again, poor service from a poor location."}
{"text":"I went here for a company children's Christmas party and had the most AMAZING time. I arrived at 8:45 a.m. (apparently that's weird, I'm told by my friends. Don't care. I'm up early anyways). The breakfast was delicious and I'm not a breakfast person (eggs, sausage, fruits, omelette's, mini muffins, etc.) and the games were so fun! This is just like Chuck E Cheese but you don't need a \"child 8 y.o. or under\" to accompany you!!!!!!!!! I loved everything about this place, the layout, the games, the prizes, EVERYTHING. It was 1 pm and I didn't want to go home.  I got a hello kitty stuffy toy and my 3 nieces got puppies on a leash, gum ball machines, and other prizes. The skeeball game ticket dispenser was broken and a worker fixed it and probably  a good 200 tickets came out and he let my niece keep them! :D  I want to go here for my next birthday. LOL."}
{"text":"Had the best time on half price wednesdays. SUCH fun games towards the back, all the guns and target and shooting the monsters...Love the one with the RED guns where you can play in teams and you have to shake to reload...some of the others looked great but customers camped out inside the cars so I never got to try them...BUT I will be back on another Wednesday...nice hostesses also, and downstairs waitress nice too, all helpful and funny. Young staff but not the stupid kind, all knowledgeable and helpful staff here. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed the arcade without waiting in line or searching for something to do. It's bigger and less hectic than Playdium (I think playdium has more games) but the ambience is super fun. I haven't tried the food yet but would like to try next time :)"}
{"text":"We met another family here on a Sunday afternoon to hand out for a bit. Having been here a number of times, there are a number of areas to hang, such as the sports bar area, and restaurants including the one in the open area of the arcade. You will spend money here, but think about the massive square footage and costs to run the space. So for the games alone we spend about 46 for 60 tokens on one and 170 on the other. The token amounts appear random, some as high as 18 for a sit down shooter and fluctuating at the virtual coupon games.   Have to admit the majority of games are pretty mindless fun and shiney, such as Crossy road, monopoly and wheel if fortune. With fresh takes on vintage stylings of Packman and Soace Invaders. Hanging out and racing games are cool and a blast. Sure some games were not working, such as Rock Em Sock Em, but oh well no biggie.  Food here? Not sure that should be a first choice, but expect the usual fare. The group of us decided on a platter of items as pigz in a blanket, squished tater tots and chewy pretzel pizza things. Please don't ask how.much that was ($29,00). Oh well, sodium, carbz and fats go well with a flat beer and funky video games. At the end, if you have 500 tokens you can. Get a lollypop!   So bring the kids on a cold weekend after for a good time, but expect to spend about $100ish all in."}
{"text":"Games were fun but food was over priced and mediocre. They go extremely light on the sauces on their sandwiches so don't be drawn in by just the pictures. In my opinion, I would go have dinner somewhere else and then come here for the games separately. If you're going to eat, order off the \"Eat & Play\" menu only. I did win myself some pretty cool prizes, so it wasn't all bad! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Never come on a Thursday night .... Arrived at Dave n Busters around 7 waited 2 hours to be seated and about another hour and 45min for food! Food isn't that great, I guess the best thing about this place is the location and the things around it"}
{"text":"Games are okay. However, this place is highly unhygienic. they don't clean any silverwares, plates etc. Avoid eating or drinking anything here."}
{"text":"Had some really good drinks here, the bartenders were awesome and kept things moving. Went here with a group that was willing to wait 2 hours for a table...pretty ridiculous but whatever, I figured the arcade and drinks were enough to keep us occupied while we were waiting.  We ended up waiting way over 2 hours to finally get seated and by that time I was happy just to eat any kind of food. D&B's is cool, but I most likely wouldn't stay here to chill sober."}
{"text":"I've been to this Dave & Buster's before and frankly had no issues, but last night I took some friends to go see the show (Bobby Motta... fantastic, awesome show) and before the show suggested we get something to eat in the Dave & Buster's restaurant. What a mistake.  To begin with we stood at the front waiting (as the sign said) forever until someone finally showed up and seated us... kind of strange because the place wasn't very busy. The waitress was okay but when our food arrived it was cold... literally. I've been to a lot of places and I've never seen Nachos served cold. It was almost funny, because they double plated the dish (as if to protect from a hot dish) but the whole thing was cold (not even room temp). I immediately pointed this out to the waitress who just sort of looked perturbed and took the dish away saying she'd bring us another one. We waited a while and a new Nachos arrived. This one was a bit better... warm in spots (not hot) and cold in others. Even the beef was cool (about room temp). Since we had been waiting a very long time and had a show to go to we kept the nachos, but I immediately asked to speak to a manager.  After a while a gentleman arrived, identified himself as a manager but did not introduce himself. He looked pissed that we had bothered him... listened while I explained the issue... then proceeded to tell me that the nachos were not supposed to be \"hot\" but rather that they keep the meats in a warming table and they simply put the dish under a salamander for a few minutes to \"warm it up a bit\" then served the dish... that they don't bake them or anything like that... also, since they do so many, by the time they get to the table they probably wouldn't be that hot (his words not mine). I pointed out too him that this may be so, but that health department regulations require that meats be kept at certain minimum temps and that the dish I was served wouldn't have passed a health inspection and would have gotten their kitchen shut down. He sort of shrugged it off and said he'd look into it and left. Frankly his attitude was offensive and he clearly didn't give a damn about my comments.  As we were finishing our \"meals\" the \"manager\" returns to tell me that he had spoken to the kitchen staff and passed along my concerns (what about his concerns?)... further, that he had tested the temperatures in the heat table and that \"I was right\" they were below required levels so he had instructed that staff throw everything out and make fresh. Well that just made my stomach turn since I had just finished eating the product that he was now telling me had been improperly handled and they had thrown away. I couldn't believe the guy was that stupid not to realize what he was essentially saying to me... or how it would make me feel. He gives no appearance of being sorry for any of this, but instead almost seems proud that he had done something about my complaint... like I owed him.  Then he tells me that he has taken my nachos off the bill (as if he did me the biggest favour in the world) and he walks away. So for the rest of the evening I had to worry that I might get food poisoning from the crap they had served. Honestly I've never seen a more inept manager in my life... any other restaurant would have fallen over themselves to apologize for serving food that didn't meet health department standards.  I wasn't looking for a free meal... but given what went on they should have apologized and waived the entire bill (which wasn't much, a salad, 3 soft drinks and a desert)... instead he \"did me a favour and didn't charge me for the bad nachos... but he did leave me worrying about food poisoning all night. Thanks for that.  Anyway... needless to say I wouldn't eat at Dave & Buster's again if you paid me to do so. Be warned!  First call Monday will be the health department to file a complaint.   https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g499300-d981701-r457131162-Dave_and_Buster_s-Vaughan_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"Went here for my sons 15th birthday which the waiter was informed, waited about 35 minutes for our order. Food was cold and I ordered Salmon which was raw in the middle. The waiter asked if I wanted something else but the family had almost finished. The Manager came out and rudely stated, \"I understand that you food was not to your liking\" like it's my fault the fish was raw. The Manager removed my order from the bill and my table was ignored but he waiter for the remainder of the meal. Dessert was not offered for my son to celebrate his birthday just handed us the check and left. Thanks Dave and Buster's for ruining my sons 15 th birthday. Horrible customer service, games are fun but eat somewhere else and save yourself"}
{"text":"Being blatantly ignored by the bartender is pretty annoying. But what's more annoying than that were the several managers walking around (behind and around the bar) and not doing a thing. Nothing ! I could tell the bartender was visibly annoyed. I could be more understanding if the bar was packed. The most people at the bar at one time, during my visit, were 8 people. That's it. I don't expect fine dining by any means, but acknowledge your customers! We were far from high maintenance... I ordered a bottled beer and my boyfriend had a Jameson ginger. And we got ignored 90% of the time. And shame on the poor management!!! This place is a joke. And to end on a positive note I really enjoyed the games and I genuinely enjoyed my food. Next time I'll eat before and go somewhere locally to enjoy a drink after."}
{"text":"My review is for the bar.  HH until 7pm with all liquor for $3.  Unbelievable deal!  Bartenders are constantly filling your glass and pours are hearty.  Plenty of screens for sports and a nice bar area with only adults allowed.  I will be back for HH for sure."}
{"text":"Aside from the lady who loaded our cards being a complete and utter bitch to my husband and I, we had a great time.  She spoke to me like I was an incompetent idiot, when trying to use my coupon. And being that she was the first employee we encountered when we walked in she easily could have ruined our whole night and impression of the place.  However, all the other employees were very friendly and helpful.   The games are reasonably priced, and the prizes are reasonably priced for the tickets you earn.   We ate dinner here as well, the food was okay nothing to write home about except the chocolate fondue we had was delicious! And our waitress was very attentive and friendly!   Overall it was a very enjoyable date night!"}
{"text":"So my family and I went here earlier today for some dinner, drinks and a little fun. And couldn't be more excited.  I called ahead to reserve a table because on the site when you look them up says that is allowed. But when I called a young women answered and said they do not take reservations at all. So I thought to myself wells that's odd. So I then asked what the wait was then and she said about 20-30 minutes. Okay awesome that's fine.  So we left home finally got there 5 minutes later. (Literally) because we live right be hind west gate. Super close. We then asked for a seat and she then said the wait was an hour and a half. Humm. Not what you just told me. And so I told her I just called and she said no one got a call regarding wait time and reservations. So then that frustrated me because you are clearly lying.   That is the main reason why this place is only getting three stars because how rude and how much mean attitude these ladies had.  As for our server Ryan who likes water sports and food. Everything else was fantastic, just really packed with tons of kids and such. But that's okay. We still had fun.   Just watch out for those from desk hosts. Rude as hell. Won't be back for awhile to this location. Tempe will still be my goto."}
{"text":"Had my brothers bachelor party there. Service was great. Food was good and the drinks kept coming. The price was fair and expected for the size of our party. Our waitress Amy was awesome. My guests and brother had a great time."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for a drink after work. It was a great experience because the person who checked out ID was super sweet and we went in during happy hour so we paid $7 for two drinks. It was awesome! The drinks were sweet and very pleasant. I would recommend this place for locals and people from out of town during happy hour who are on a budget."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a beer and to check it out. First problem: it was 4:30, few people in, but it was over 5 minutes before we were acknowledged. After our drinks arrived, no one ever came to check on us despite no more customers arriving, and we had to wait for someone to show up to close our tab.  They need to work on customer service a lot or we won't be back."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, pick a table and wait( lil extensive) service good after... On to the food nachos app... No.. Tortilla soup. Yes. Caveman combo ribs need help... Mac n cheese child said \" it sucked\" baked   alfredo and steak linguini dishes ... Dont let them get cold.. One of the downfalls is very cold AC and very loud.. Should provide a filter earplug at the door...."}
{"text":"Melissa was amazing!!! And she wasn't even behind the bar!!!! I sat and waited 20-25mins for a drink as I sat at the bar patient!!!! You all really need a better bar staff!!!! Honestly just sad..... However Marisa was great and it's really sad that she has to share her tips with the sorry Saturday bar night staff!!!!  I'm a bartender for over 7yrs !!! Slow sad service!!!"}
{"text":"My previous experience with D&B is all East Coast, so I had some pre-conceived expectations prior to this visit. Those establishments were the size of small countries that I've visited in Europe! This one... not so much. I would actually rate this location a solid 2.5 stars, but since I wasn't overwhelmed, I rounded down.   I took a single-mom friend and her kids here for a night out. We went on a Thursday night, so it wasn't overly packed, but there was a nice crowd. Having experienced D&B food before (not that there is really anything wrong with it, just meh and way overpriced), we ate at the nummy Cheeseburger Cheeseburger down the way. Definitely a good choice.  Upon arrival we navigated the maze of tables to the \"card charging station\" and loaded up our plastic. The kids ran amok like junkies in a poppy field for about 45 minutes - tickets filling their little buckets. Mom and I trailed behind, people watching. This was by far the most interesting activity of the night. There was the scary man at the boxing game that had seen one too many steroids. His neck was two feet wide and the GUI boxer opponent had no choice but to pummel that huge target. My friend and I actually considered giving this one a try until we saw his display. His grunts and thrusts had us looking for cover for fear that he would turn on us and our laughter would definitely give away our location. There was the skeletal like goth-anorexic girl that had doubled her size by applying thick layers of black makeup. And there were the high school jocks that all walked with that inexplicable bounce that teen boys have. Like I said, for us it was all about the people watching.  The highlight of the evening happened at the jump rope simulation. We all discovered that jumping over an electronic eye posed far more of a challenge than anyone could imagine. Seriously this thing was way too funny (not so much for the jumper, but rather those watching the jumper contort and pounce).  Seventy-five minutes after entering, we were all out of money and selecting our \"prizes\" from the D&B store of crap. All in all we had a decent time. So why you may ask would I give this a 2 star rating? Well this little 75 minute trip into game land cost me $175 dollars and all I got to show for it was a bruise from when I was hiding from the roided dude on the boxing game. Yes there were 5 of us, but if I'm going to throw down this kind of money on games, I'm definitely going to Game Works!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. There's literally 10 people behind the bar chit chatting while I wait for someone to help. They take their time in everything they do and they all look miserable doing it. As for their food, it's decent. I would definitely eat somewhere else before coming here. This place is only good for their half off games on Wednesday cause it doesn't require dealing with their employees."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are looking for expensive games. If you have a couple kids get a loan to come here. Other than that it's a really nice place."}
{"text":"The food: * * The fun: * * * *  I went with the average of the two here. The food was nothing special... extremely generic, generally bland, and blatantly overpriced. The only things worse were the drink prices. I would only get something to eat here if you're doing the \"Eat and Play\" combo deal (or whatever it's called).   The games on the other hand are a pretty cool addition to a night of food and drinks. There's pretty much something for everyone, from the traditional skeeball to the more ornate virtual boxing. I have fun skipping around like a three year old from one game to another, collecting tickets along the way like I'm driving through Texas. Georgeann G and I tried the \"what your baby would look like\" machine and the kid looked like Mike TV from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, that was pretty memorable.   Don't forget your fun..."}
{"text":"I came to Dave and Busters because the hotel I'm staying at is right near it, but anyway I had so much fun honestly and I haven't had so much fun in a while. The games were great and not too expensive for credits, I enjoyed Pac-Man and managed to get the number 1 high score (yep I'm a pro) then the new tomb raider game I played after was really fun. I really like how they always update the games frequently, but one problem was the first game that caught my eyes Pop em Sock em, but the problem was it was out of order... I was so disappointed but I'm sure everything else I did made up for it. I'm still gonna give it a 5/5 because of how much fun I had."}
{"text":"Dave & Busters delivers on fun. We waited for a while for this location to open since it's closer to where I live.  There's lots of games, a dining area and bar with big screen tv's everywhere.  It is kid friendly,  but you have to be 21 and older after 9 p.m. to enter.   One option you can do is an Eat and Play combo. With these, you get a discount on your food when you get a game card with your dinner, but the menu is limited to certain items on that deal. I suggest this if you plan to eat and play. I was eating healthier that night and got salmon with wilted spinach and substituted the seasonal vegetables (broccoli) for the rice. My husband got a steak and shrimp noodle dish. For my food, everything is covered in butter. On the salmon, I enjoyed it along with the peppery seasoning. The spinach and broccoli were too buttery for me to enjoy. A manager stopped by to ask how everything was and I told him about the veggies which I already ate. He offered to cook more without butter, but I was full at that point. Now I know to order it without butter in the future. It was good food. Not the best salmon I ever had, but satisfying.  The games are a lot of fun. If you don't do Eat &Play, you can purchase game cards at the front or at a kiosk. Keep your card for future visits as there is an activation fee for new cards. It is really noisy though.  Even on busier nights, there's always something available to play. I appreciate this. There's classic games like skee ball and hoops. But there's a decent selection of arcade like games like Batman, Mariokart and a new Justice League game. Some games give you tickets you can exchange for prizes. And the prizes are decent from toys, candy, shot glasses and stuffed animals to DC Comics and Nintendo novelty items, headphones, Bluetooth speakers and more. I'm personally enjoying my Pac Man mug that illuminates dots and characters when hot drinks are added to the cup. And if you want to save up for something, the points stay on your card so you can come back and continue to add points.   There are deals on certain days. We enjoy half-price Wednesday.  All games and drinks are half price. Also, most receipts have a survey you can take to get a code for a free appetizer or Buy $10, Get $10 game card on a future visit. You can also get deals for signing up for their email and registering your card.   D&B's really has something for everyone."}
{"text":"I take my kid there, we are playing a game that you throw ping pong balls in fishbowls. If you score 1500 points you get 500 tickets. With 20 balls to throw total, we have 1450 points after 19 balls. Averaging 75 points(76.31) per ball thrown, I very easily could have got to 1500 points. when I explained this to the staff member, he said don't worry, the next game is on me. Now if getting 150 points was easy, no problem. But in this case I got -475 tickets this way. Thanks for listening D & B. Also fecal matter was smeared about one of the toilets. By who? Its a mystery ;-)"}
{"text":"Tons of fun games, bowling, and a really cool photo booth! Plus drinks and good food available! One of my favorite places to go! I wish I could go every week! Tons of fun and a good date night spot!"}
{"text":"Most of the games are broken and we had a bunch of credits just wasted on games that just stopped working as my daughter was playing. There was also trash everywhere. I get it that people are slobs but I didn't see one employee walking around the whole time we were there. Probably should have goes to Westgate"}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun there with another couple. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated at 7 pm on a Friday night, which was fine because we played video games to fill the time. The food and service were EXTREMELY average. My wife and I both had the sliders, which were cold, but my ribs and fries were pretty good. We'll definitely take our kids back to play the games. Not sure if we'll eat there again, though."}
{"text":"The host was very rude. I normally like being there, but her attitude was so horrible that I couldn't stand to be there more than 15 mins."}
{"text":"We do not generally come here, as it is somewhat of a hike from our home, but we decided to wander out this way today. Last time we were here, we were not pleased, but today, we had a much better experience.   They had a ton of new games, which is a bonus! All of them were working too.....double bonus! I think they are a bit expensive, but it was a treat to go, so we didn't mind spending a couple of extra bucks.  After playing out the credits on our card, we decided to have a late lunch. The menu is quite large, but has a great selection. Our server, Kiara, was wonderful! You could tell she was stressed out from her day, but she was very pleasant. We are pretty easy to take care of and you could almost hear the sigh of relief she gave when we told her to take her time and were ready to order when she was able to make it back from another table.  The restrooms were gross and the hostess stand was filled with confused girls who couldn't have cared less. The prize room was so empty of prizes, we decided to keep our points for our next visit.  We will be back, we will ask for Kiara to be our server, and hopefully we will be able to find prizes worth taking home!"}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner with my family! I had the New York Strip it was nice n juicy, mash potato n the onions excellent too...Had a taste of chicken Alfredo it was good just need more sauce!! We had a great time playing games with all kids n it was 1/2 price games on Wednesday yea"}
{"text":"This place not only offers fun and excitement for the variety of arcades, but also offers great food. The best dessert is the chocolate cake, so decadent and rich."}
{"text":"I will never come back here. If I could give them 0 stars I would. Service is so rude!!!!!!! Me and my friends who one of them is 20 could not go in because apparently you have to be 21 to play at this basically chuckee cheese joint. It's ridiculous!!! The people were very rude and food was horrible when I did go in but had to ditch my friend. Can you believe this?! Dave and busters is supposed to be a place for family fun but instead it breaks apart friendships. 0/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Five Star Wow the food choices are great. The prices are good as well. You get better deal if you buy promotional items because you get free tokens. Love that you don't actually need to insert tokens just swipe your card and if your running low you can upload more tokens at the kiosk or download their app an do it on your phone.  The have a nice selection of games to play .  A little noisy, but should be expected!  We will be back !!"}
{"text":"If I had the option to give them a 10 star I would. My family and I have been at Dave & Buster many times before and we always had a good time. This was our first time planning our sons 3rd birthday at Dave & Buster's and won't be the last.   Sara went through the option with us and we choose the board room which was perfect for our 40 guests. She was very pleasant, from the beginning she had a great customer service. Once we got there 30 before minutes before the party, the manager (forgot her name :( sorry, she has reddish hair, she was very nice and took us to the room and would frequently come by throughout the party to make sure we are doing okay and if we need anything). Once we got to the room Rebecca from the beginning started helping us, brought whatever we needed, and was hands on and was with us through out the whole time, she is amazing, honestly amazing and I wish her bright future bc of how humble and hard working she is.   Our waiter Luis and waitress, they were fast working, helpful and gave great service, our family and friends were very happy with everyone's service and received the greatest service which made my husband and I very happy.   The food and the entry's were great options and we're delicious and was enough for everyone.   Most important my son, his cousins and friends had an amazing time. OVER ALL WE ARE VERY HAPPY AND WILL BE BACK SOON. Thank you for everyone for helping and making this birthday so much more special."}
{"text":"Not gunna lie, it's a good time, but that statement has a few conditions.   Overall, the place can be quite pricey, which is why half-priced Wednesdays is the way to go. Although, be prepared to line up for each game since that's also the most busy night.   The game selection is pretty good. They bring in new games quite frequently and switch the layout around pretty often which is fun.   Full Disclaimer though, the Yahtzee game is addicting!! Be prepared to use up all your game credits here!"}
{"text":"Meh food - should have eaten before going. Deafening noise level. Overpriced in my opinion. Will have to find another place to entertain the children."}
{"text":"My first time and it was so much fun! Family oriented placed and after a certain time it's definitely a place to drink and play. You'll need to get a card and load chips they have a selection for you to choose from. There was a lot of us so I took advantage of the 4 party pack. Once you have your card which they charge a $2 activation fee, you can so straight to playing! Make sure to keep your card to avoid future activation fee that you will be charge with for a new card. So may fun games for more than just 2 people than what you're normally used too.  If you're interested in eating because we did go on a Friday night be prepared to wait for hours, but you can always let time fly by playing and trust me it goes by quick. The food was good, although my man didn't really enjoy his chicken fingers, he liked the bone out chicken more. The French fries wasn't that great though so I don't recommend them. I haven't tried much besides the nachos and spinach Artichoke appetizers but they were great! I really like our server Analuisa I think was her name, not sure if I spelled it right. She was so sweet, friendly and accommodating. She said that they don't do anything special for birthdays and don't have candles for the dessert but she was able to find some and light it too! She really went out of her way to make our night special!  We will definitely come back here for more fun and supercharge our cards!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is a dumpster fire. Had a fun time there last nite. Kept kids busy while we watched football. Kids loved it.  Food is impressively bad. The soggy wings were the best thing we had. Wow is the food bad. But what really impressed me was the restroom. I had to hold my breath and I was in the Army using latrines in the middle of the desert. Bravo"}
{"text":"I've been to Dave and Busters on several occasions, the service has never really been impressive, but last night was embarrassingly horrible. It was extremely dead, the staff was definitely not overwhelmed. Yet, they were NOWHERE to be found. Or, if they were caught out in the open, very careful to walk briskly and not make eye contact. We moved tables 3 times in an attempt to be served. At the end of our long awaited meal, I noticed my son didn't get a portion of his ordered meal, 2 sliders. I mentioned it to our server, he disappeared and came back 20 seconds later with a scorching hot plate with 2 shriveled looking sliders on it. He'd obviously forgotten them under the warmer. For 45 minutes. Oh, there was a fruit fly in my pint, couldn't even be bothered to bring it to our servers attention. Not terribly anxious to EVER go back."}
{"text":"Food takes three times as long as it should to arrive. Don't expect many warm smiles from the employees , they all seem stressed out and under appreciated( with an exception from a few nice young ladies at the winners circle. Good job girls )  If you have questions about promotions , pricing , non working games ... don't expect quick answers or sometimes answers at all.  I've been coming to this location for almost 8 years . The only reason is because there are memories with my daughter at a very young age and wednesdays half priced games kind of became a tradition for our family. Otherwise, I'd take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fun place to play games but it costs a lot unless you buy the bogo $20 coupon and then it's a little better. On one game I hit the center of the circle like 10 times dead center but it only gave me the jackpot once. On another game I could make all my shots in the fish bowls but then after that hardly any of them.... sounds fishy huh? They need to give better prizes for what you spend but you can trade them in for some good appetizers at their restaurant!!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give zero stars, service sucks and management is as horrible. Have not seen much of the waitress and management is dumber than a box of rocks. After another waiter brought out our food and two of our plates of food got dumped on the ground cause he don't know what he is doing, the manager tried to offer cheese sticks or quesadilla. Tried to give us an appetizer for our entree that was dumped by their waiter. Never going there to eat again, maybe to play games but the service at the restaurant makes me want to not go back and spend money there for anything."}
{"text":"I'm not kidding when I say these were the best nachos I've ever had. Amazing chili flavor with the chicken, black beans, fresh chips. Just great.  Others at the table had THE MAC 'n Cheese and said it was pretty good as well.  I still don't understand how some of the \"games\" aren't considered straight-up gambling. There was a teenage girl sitting at a slot-machine that dispensed tickets. Yes, it isn't money, but still is just a little too close to a Vegas slot machine for my taste. And I have loose morals.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Huge menu, okay food, fun atmosphere.  I will compliment the service, as our server was very friendly and helpful.  Only complaint from a recent visit is that my meal was a little cold when served, presumable because it was sitting for a while in the kitchen.  This is not someplace you come for the food, but if you do eat, it's not bad."}
{"text":"It's like a glorified Chuck E Cheese with a dash of Buffalo Wild Wings thrown in. Service was spotty. Our server was sweet but tons of confusion on who was supposed to take our orders. Food was eh, definitely not my thing. The games were fun but if you come with a group wanting some \"friendly\" competition, there aren't a whole lot of games to play head to head."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. However, they need to fix their broken arcade machines. There were at least 5 machines that are put of order and some that are \"working\" are not swiping correctly where they took my tickets but the game won't start."}
{"text":"D&B is a great place for the family to go have some fun in doors playing video games, bowling, and shooting pool.  My 10 year old son really enjoys this place compared to the other places that have indoor games.  We like to compete on the driving, skiing and trivia games.  It's a good time if your into playing like a kid!!   We usually don't eat here for there are better options for dinning near by.  The service is usually very good.  We started a game that stopped mid-way through and one of the managers gave us credit for the game.  Then he gave us an extra game card with some credits as a token of his appreciation for coming to D&B! Wow a guy and what service!  The kiddo's like redeeming their tokens for toys and stuff in the gift shop.  Sure the options to choose from are cheesy, but the kids really enjoy picking out a new toy.  I recommend planning a head and going on a day they are running a special like on Wed they had 1/2 priced games.  Have some fun with your family and friends being a kid again!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out and we happened upon Happy Hour! $1 off wine & half off cocktails. However it being a work night, my friend and I decided to just grab a bite to eat. Our server, Katelin, was so amazing! She's so friendly & nice, and made sure we had everything we needed. I know we'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a must go to place for some family entertainment.   As far as the food it is garbage. Been here twice and both times I have sat at a table with plates with leftover food stuck the plate as other plates are piled on top of it. Tables have been greasy and filthy both times. Service is pretty garbage as well. No one seems to care about their work environment other than the fact that they are there to collect a paycheck.   All in all. Staff at the restaurant is horrible, food is horrible but the arcade side is awesome. Maybe it's time for some experience managers to come and train their staff."}
{"text":"Updating and lowering a star.  The last time we were in my burger was not cooked through and the time before the nachos were bad & had to be tossed out.  If I am paying $14.00 for a burger or nachos I don't want to toss them in the trash.  I couldn't even eat half of them.  They are hit and miss but when they are a hit they are great."}
{"text":"A few minutes ago my review would have been two stars but the Manager, Toby, just changed that. Came with the family for dinner and games. Wasn't busy at all when we arrived but still waited 15 minutes for drink orders. Waited 30 minutes for our appetizer which came 5 minutes before our meal. Food was good but cold. Toby, came by to ask how our meal was. We told him our issue but didn't need fresh food or any compensation and just giving a tip for future patrons to enjoy their time and meals there. He truly truly cared about our experience and he listened and promised to change things for the better. He took care of us. Toby has been a manager for only 2 months and already making a difference. We will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Downtown Summerlin today and this wasn't my first choice for lunch as I wanted outdoor experience to enjoy the beautiful day in Vegas.  Unfortunately, my first choice, the dim sum restaurant is now out of business.  Didn't realize that I hadn't been in the area in such a long time.  So since its been years since we've been to a D&B, my husband made the final decision.  Going to D&B is scary for me because I know how much my husband loves his video games.  The menu has changed quite a bit over the years. Per our waiter, the menu was updated this past February.  Choosing an entree was a little difficult for me, do I go with the fish and chips that I've been craving for a couple of days now, that short rib mac and cheese sandwich looks amazing, but so does the CA turkey melt and the Crispy Nashville-style hot Chicken.   Normally, my husband has me order first, but because I was so undecided, I was very pleased when he got the Short Rib Mac and Cheese sandwich. Better yet, it comes with TOTS!  My husband did enjoy his sandwich. With the kick bite I got from it, the bread is so buttery and nicely toasted. The short ribs, nice and tasty and sweet and with the sweetness from the ribs on the mac and cheese, it was Oh so good!.  And tots, was alright.  As for my fish and chips, it was alright, but really oily. The chips, were nice and crunchy. The dipping sauce for the fish was a little too malty for me.  We received great service. And because it was Sunday and busy, our service was a little slow.  As for the location for the bathroom, we were directed to what I guess is the only facility, next to the huge Connect 4.  All in all, it was a typical experience. We most certainly will be back with family and to win a few prices."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for my birthday dinner however we were told it was a two hour wait to get a table despite there being tables that were empty the entire time (and it wasn't due to them being reserved since they don't take reservations for small groups). As such we decided to cross the parking lot and head to Wendel Clark's restaurant then come back for some gaming.  We returned an couple of hours later, bought our power passes and headed out to play the various games we had heard about that excited us...  4 way air hockey - Out of Service Table Hockey - Out of service Simpson Soccer - Out of service Ball rolling horse race game - Only 4 seats actually worked Skeeball - Only two available and they had a huge line   I could go on and but the gist of it was at least 40% of the games had red out of service terminals.  Ok well that still leaves a lot of functioning games right? Sadly a good number of them wouldn't read your card (even after numerous attempts and various methods of insertion), or when they did start up the machine wouldn't register the points properly (the beer pong game was the most egregious), or you would be debited points but the game wouldn't start, or you'd be able to play but for some reason the points wouldn't get credited to your card.  The place has the potential to be a blast but the execution is just terrible. My group managed to have fun (mostly thanks to alcohol) but for what we all paid and the time it took us to get there from downtown Toronto we definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First of all, Jillian's is now a Dave and Busters which may have affected some of the services, but it was still fairly bad. I went with a  group of people to eat first and the \"Market Grill\" was awful! I had been to places with Mongolian grills before and this was hands-down pitiful. They have very little selection and often ran out of food, even while the seventeen managers were bumbling around.  The service stunk. The female cook would ALWAYS put a man's food on the grill first, even if you had been waiting there for 5-8 minutes before. It would be one thing if it happened once, but it happened 3 times in a row! It took me and two of my friends almost 20 minutes to get our food. The salad bar was just as bad. I could have gotten better in my own fridge.  After almost fainting from the bill ($18.93 for undercooked stir-fry and a salad!), we went bowling. It was totally overpriced and the system is so slow that it took 45 minutes to make it through one game. We wasted 15 minutes because we were told if we went over our hour we would be charged by the minute. No way.  Hoping to salvage the night, we went upstairs to get dessert and play a few games. Once again, disappointment. They could barely fit our party into a booth. The dessert were completely overpriced ($8 for a shallow ceramic dish of chocolate with graham crackers, marshmallows and strawberries! Are you kidding me? I have a better fondue set that I got for $10) and looked like it was thrown together. The prices for the games were also way too much. You have to pay to get their official card then pay to put tokens on the card to use to play games that were not as good as the ones we had at home. We ended up leaving, going home to play our own superior and free game systems. It was also weird that we were carded before we went in, but then we saw family after family with children from the age of 6 months to 10 years old. If it's for the whole family, why are you carding us? Why are you making this an \"adult\" place if basically it's just Chuckie Cheese with booze and without weird characters?"}
{"text":"Just tried Wednesday salsa night for the first time.  It was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"My review is only on the gaming experience as the food seemed overpriced to me. My daughter spent about forty minutes playing and she had a good time.  We both felt like the games were designed for quick gaming and we seemed to spend most of our time looking for games that lasted more than 15 seconds. We came with a discount card and it still seemed a little pricey. Kind of a bummer because the amount of sports televisions really had me looking forward to coming back for some Sunday football but fear that after some food, beverage, and gaming I will have spent a mortgage payment."}
{"text":"You know I'm not a fan of the basic burger joint.  They would typically get 1 star from me.  However D&B have some fresh food. The problem I have with the fresh food is how its bombarded with the less healthy stuff.  Course if you're looking for a burger joint, this is your place."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had a real good time. I've been to a few D&Bs but this one is really huge. This is the first time I've been to one with a bowling alley in it. It also had a section for pool tables to add to the arcade area.  Bowling (expensive imo $35 for an hour of bowling) was fun but they didn't have a rack with spare balls for you to choose from. So that means whatever lane you're in, you're stuck with the balls that's given to you unless you can find another lane who's kind enough to trade balls with you. This was an issue because my gf wanted a lighter ball but luckily the group next to us left so we were able to switch the balls out while the lane was vacant.   The arcade games were cool. Just $20 gave us enough game credits to play everything we were interested in.  All in all had a good time but probably won't come here if bowling is the main thing we're looking to do. As for bar food, drinks and gaming, it's great."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday evening. Fun games. Stayed for dinner. The restaurant wasn't busy. The food was actually very good. Customer service was not the best. Slow and not very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. If I had kids, they would not be allowed to step foot in there. The entire place smells terrible. The bathrooms are even worse and the service is utterly horrible. It took forever for someone to greet us, then took forever to bring drinks. While we were finally eating, all the servers were standing right next to our table talking to each other, completely ignoring our empty drinks and our struggle to eat wings with no napkins. So gross and bad service. I'm sure there's plenty of other Dave and Buster's in Charlotte that are worth going to but not this one."}
{"text":"Good for social events that need lots of space but that's really it.  The games here are mostly ticket games and generic gun shooters catered to American people. I guess that's why it's called Dave & Busters.  At least Gameworks have more variety of games. I can't believe I'm saying Dance Dance Revolution is variety but yes."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Extremely disrespectful bartender and manager. When I presented them with a valid Washington state ID the bartender (didn't get his name, young and douchey looking with a soul patch) left with it for over ten minutes, came back and blatantly lied saying its \"Arizona state law\" they can't take my kind of ID which I know is not true. Then proceeded to be an asshole about it. Definitely don't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"First time I came here, the service was so slow, I had to go to the bar to get my drinks. The second time I came here, the service was worse than the first. First and foremost, Dave and busters isn't known for awesome food nor are they known to be fancy, so with that being said, the service should be somewhat decent. Our server, Johana, seemed to be bothered by our existence. I get it, long day dealing with people or whatever the issue may be, but keep your problems to yourself and welcome to corporate America my friend. Fake a smile, pretend you like your job and be grateful you even have one. The service industry is tough, I understand that... But if your sole job is customer service, simple math calculations (cashiering) and serving and you can't do any of those qualifications that you were asked/expected of you, why did you apply for this job? We had a giant group that came in and she didn't want to put the tables together and expected us to stand around one small table. She then made a comment that we were mean cause we asked to move the tables together and we even offered to move them ourselves and put them back. Not sure how that was mean of us? We ordered a beer tower which took 30 minutes to get and the lady behind the counter gave it to us because Johanna didn't want to serve us the beer. She asked someone else for whatever reason. She didn't apologize for the wait nor did she apologize for the crummy attitude. She gave us the bill with no receipt and change only which seemed weird. We asked for the itemized receipt which she was hesitant to give us because she shorted us the change to keep as tip. When she got caught, she gave us the proper change and gave some lame excuse on why the change was wrong. Thanks Dave and busters for hiring thieves and incompetent people."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but dam the drink prices are straight up club prices. Won't be watching ufc here again $110 dollar tab for a shared entree is not worth it"}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place. We have to admit the food was great. The points the quality of the food gained the place was quickly lost by the poor service. It took so long to get our food out of the kitchen that we had to get a manager involved. Our server had warned us that the place was woefully understaffed.  Dinner took over 2 hours. We had mentioned that we were headed to their theater for a show.  Speaking of which,  we could not get waited on in the theater. We managed to arrive 15 minutes before show time. We were asked to find our own seats and couldn't find anyone to take a drink order.  You would think that a place that depends so heavily on pay as you go entertainment and alcohol sales would do a better job of it."}
{"text":"Very clean for a family fun center.  The food is delicous and the atmosphere is very well integrated between family fun and adult fine dinning.  This is no Chuck E. Cheese, but there are still tons of games for kids of all ages."}
{"text":"We made reservations at Dave and Busters for our wedding rehearsal dinner in late August 2017.  While the staff were very friendly and accomodating, unfortunately the orders took more than 45 minutes to make it to the table.  We were a table of just over 20, but we had reservations, so we couldn't understand what took so long, and no one really took the time to explain it.  To top it off, not all of the orders came at the same time, some guests waited another 20 minutes plus before receiving their meal. The food was ok, and the arcade games were fun - but the long wait took away from the experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good sports bar..we came primarily to watch the b-ball playoff game and were not disappointed...and they let us stay til game end. HUGE tv's with variety on but Warriors were on the big screens and we could hear the play calling.Typical bar food...not bad, not great but ok. Attentive waitress...she checked on us frequently and kept drinks filled. The game room looks like fun for another visit."}
{"text":"I would like to let the world know how terrible the management is at this place. They should not get any stars. I have no idea how they got their jobs but they should be fired today! Their names are Jillian and Amadh. They do not know how to handle their own establishment when there is an issue. We had bought tokens in advance online and the cards were not loaded when we got here. The managers could care less and did not try to accommodate at all. They wouldn't even offer us a free dessert or discount. They told us we had to buy more tokens here. I cannot stand horrible customer service! It is so simple to fix an issue by taking care of guests by a small gesture. They did nothing!!!!! Y'all suck!!!! I hope you guys lose business."}
{"text":"Big fan of Dave and Busters but this location in particular has terrible customer service. Waited for my food for a whole hour and a half just to get two entrees and when the ribs came out, they were burnt. No silverware or plates were handed out for appetizers, even after asking for them before the food came out. Hope it was just a bad experience and doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"Outclass food and service. It was a fun time to enjoy an extravagant fine dining experience, and playing everything of our choice. What more could be better than this on a weekend out with friends or family. Really enjoyed the crisp apple pecan salad, the lawnmower, Parmesan creamed corn, fire grilled salmon, spicy rice medley and French fries. It was a treat to eat.... in order to spoil ourselves a weekend night. Explicit menu and spot on service were the highlights. With your remarkable servers you can't go wrong. That's a must go location for me every fortnight."}
{"text":"ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B.   I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)  The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)  Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol.   The prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.  Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining.   I can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Enjoyed 1/2 price games on Wednesday. Lots of new games. Cut the rope, mario brothers and fish tank. Spent about 5 hours of fun and dining on rainy Fall break day. Good food and cocktails. Highly recommend teriyaki steak and mashed taters."}
{"text":"This is the second time we as a family have went to this location and have had horrible experience we go as a big family I'm a server at Olive garden and do big tables all the time this place can not handle big tables and the management is rude and not friendly they switched our server to Hanna and she was amazing but this was after our meal came out wrong and two hours in we will no longer be bringing our hard earned money here:("}
{"text":"This was a creative and unique experience!  I will break this review into two parts, food and entertainment. Let's begin with the food; the burger was well proportioned the fries were very tasty and seasoned well, however a lot of the food was very bland. The adult tasty beverages were well priced and tasty, feel free to enjoy a couple of them on happy hour. Second, the entertainment. This establishment is really geared for kids and young teens. It is full of video arcade games some of the games will give you tokens someone I'm not. It is extremely noisy and many of the games to play are very expensive. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the virtual reality ride with the dinosaurs. Sadly it was very expensive at five dollars a person for less than two minutes of entertainment. Over all, I would do this experience again. I don't suggest doing it at 5 PM at the height of dinner perhaps a little later if you were going with adults and perhaps a little earlier if you're going with small children."}
{"text":"I've been to this Dave and Busters twice now. We decided to opt in for some fun here last night for new years instead of freezing our buns off outside. I generally like this place, there are a ton of games and you can win tickets to redeem for prizes afterwards. You can tell which ones are the high winning games because there is always a line. They have a rule where if your under 19, you must be out by 10pm and believe me, it's best if you come later in the night anyway, because even though you always hear oh Dave and Busters is like chuck e cheese for adults, there's still a million kids, everywhere, hogging all the games. oyyi  My biggest pet peeve is people who hog games, honestly it's very frustrating, yes I get it, you're on a roll on one of the high earning games, but there are people behind you waiting for their turn. I honestly had this one couple last night play the same game probably 30 times. After about 10 minutes of me standing behind them, they turned around and said, Oh you want a turn? Yes I replied, oh okay. Then they proceeded to play 10 more times before I got a turn.  The games quite frequently will run out of tickets, so you'll have to flag down an attendant to either a)un jam the tickets or b)refill the tickets.  The prizes are mediocre, most of it dollar store quality, however we always redeem our tickets for candy lol.  On to the bar! After an exhausting 2 hours of playing we had some dessert and drinks at the bar. We all shared the chocolate fondue platter which was DELICIOUS! My sister and I both got the Strawberry Watermelon Margarita which was very tasty, a bit too sugary and ALOT of alcohol in it. Definitely went straight to my head lol  Overall I like dave and busters, but people really need to learn how to share, and when I say that I mean grown adults."}
{"text":"Let's face it.. Dave & Busters is one of those places where even if you receive extremely poor service, you will go back because of the genius concept of games, food, and cheap alcohol, all in one place.  That's exactly what happened here.   Despite the great concept, I had to give this location 3 stars due to the inconsistent service & lack of management. However, I understand it's only been open for 4 days.   Great job on the door-men who open the door and greet you as well as the main helpful \"front desk\" women who held it down with the dozens of lost people in line. Second, Alfred/Alfredo, our bartender was very friendly despite the busyness there was at the one bar. Side note- build a second bar? Third, the hostesses were giving different quote times for my friends & I. When we decided to check in for a table, they quoted us 30 mins. About 55 minutes later, we finally got seated. Next, our server Daisy took care of our party fairly smoothly. The only issue we had was the offensive remark she made in regards to saying all 3 of my male Asian friends look the same. Keep in mind all 3 people had no common features in height, weight, skin tone, hair, smile, eyes, or eyewear. This was after she tried taking my friend's vertical ID to her manager. I'm 23 & also have a vertical ID. Why did she disregard mine? Nevada photo IDs are good for 8 years, therefore if someone receives their license at the age of 16, then of course it'll still be vertical after they turn 21. Lastly, the taller gentleman with the headset who was in charge of the very back table area told us they were closed & we had to go. We got our appetizers, drinks, then dessert before the dinner food, then dinner food, then second round of drinks & then checks before this happened. However, we were still waiting to get our credit card back & finishing up drinks. If you ask me, that's not common courtesy at all. Don't kick someone out when it's your staff that we're waiting for. Maybe if we got sat within the expected time frame, we would've left earlier so your staff could go home.   Thanks Dave & Busters for your great concept & nice venue for Vegas, but please enforce a better system. I hope to give a better updated review in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place always my favorite. Great service always. The drinks are great also. I am a big kid at heart."}
{"text":"I arrived on a Wednesday night at 10:30 pm at the Platinum lounge for country dancing, but nobody was there. Dancing must have stopped at 10 or earlier. Supposedly free lessons were given at 7 but nobody hung around very long.  The dance area is large (that is the one good thing about it!). Most of the area is cement tile and a portion is linoleum that looks like fake wood. It's very cheesy to say the least to have two different surfaces. Was the linoleum too expensive? The dance floor is in front of the bar so when it's crowded people who are walking around will get in the way of dancers.   I doubt serious dancers will frequent the Platinum room very often because the room layout is too hazardous and the hard sticky floors will cause injuries.   My guess is that hip hop and freestyle dancing to rock music will dominate. It's definitely oriented to youngsters that want to party and to do freestyle dancing.  The spacious billiard room has a good wood floor. Go figure!  This review is only for the Platinum Lounge at D&B and with dancing in mind. See other reviews for the rest of this very large club. I will update this review when I go dancing there."}
{"text":"I came on Wednesday Havana Nights on their roof top patio, so I cannot speak for any other parts of this big place. There is no cover and the dance lessons are free.  Dance lessons were held from 7 pm - 8:30. Two Latin dances are taught -- the night I was there it was merengue and chacha. The lady instructor was fairly good.  Since the dance area is on the rooftop, this is a venue that is only as pleasant as the outside weather. I have been told that summer dancing is intolerable (the tile floor must get hot enough to burn feet).  The dance floor is sizable but unfortunately is made of a glazed tile. So, don't come there with real dance shoes. It seems that the architects of this place never imagined that people really like to dance. Duh!  Most of the dances that night are salsa but there is also a generous amount of bachata, chacha, and merengue. Fortunately there was almost no free style (without a partner) dance being done. This is a place for partner dancing. Music is done by a DJ and as you might guess is almost entirely Latin.   The crowd was large and at times the floor was very crowded. Ability ranged from total beginner to advanced.   There were all ages but most tended to be in the 20-30 age range. I liked the young ladies because they dressed in skimpy hot pants, short skirts, and high heels. Ooooooooo! La! La!  Drinks were half priced and yet they were very boozy. Can't complain about that!  Unfortunately dancing stops at 11:30. The dance floor was full so I'm puzzled why they stop so early.   Overall this venue is a good salsa scene but I can't give it more than a 3 star because it has serious weaknesses. It seems as though dancing at DB was an afterthought after it was built -- either that or whomever designed it knew nothing about the needs of dancers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here Wednesday night and had a pretty good experience, fun little date night because we just got to feel like kids for a little bit. It wasn't crowded which made our experience a little bit better as well.  We first ate and I liked that they had deals to where certain meals you choose can give you a certain amount of points. Food wasn't terrible but it also wasn't 5-star dining. We got great, fast and friendly service. I like that they have a huge variety of food and drinks on their menu, we also caught them at Happy Hour. I didn't give that 5th star for the quality of the food and prices. Again, food wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing either. It can get a little pricey, two drinks, two meals, an appetizer plus  a little over 250 points added to our players card came out to almost $100.  Your points go by pretty quickly! Loved all the variety of different games but you just keep swiping your card to play to the next minute being out of points which is where it starts to get pricey again. They do have a big variety of prizes that you can cash in for which was a plus as well.  I'll definitely be back. Fun experience overall"}
{"text":"Games are fun but alot of people just sit around and hog them.  The food was not good. Chicken was dry and rubbery and the dipping sauces were salty. I would come for the games if you can get the people who just hang out at them to move."}
{"text":"I give this business a positive review, although I am so uncoordinated and slow that I stink at playing most of their games. Not their fault! The prices per play can be a little high, but once I found a game that I was good at, out came the thousands of tickets. The employees were nice, and there were many games available to play.   2015 update: My previous review is still accurate. I have since then visited this location several times. I tried their food once for dinner and give it 3 stars. I would like for them to offer better prizes, because I have yet to find something that I want to spend my tickets on. During my most recent visit, an employee was on her phone, and we had to loudly said, \"Hello!\" in order to get her attention to serve us."}
{"text":"I like Dave and Buster's it's the only \"adult\" arcade in the area but there's some problems.   I came here recently for my 21st birthday and while I had a good time like always there were some issues:   I came here for lunch and the service was terrible. I was sitting at a booth in the Midway and was there for a good 15 minutes before a server finally acknowledged me. She was incredibly slow at getting our drinks, first I order a Guinness, which is listed on the menu as one of their draught beers.   She leaves for about 5-10 minutes and informs me that they are out of Guinness. Incredibly unprofessional, this was the first time I've been to a restaurant where they were actually out of a beer listed on their drink menu. I then settled for an Alexander Keith's. She was so slow at pouring our beers that our food actually came out BEFORE we received our drinks!  The food, as always was amazing, I got the famous Philly Cheesesteak and fries. The service really ruined the experience though.   The server apologized but could tell that she was indifferent and was rude.   I then went to play the games and noticed that there were a LOT of games that were out of order, more than there should be in my opinion.   Having that many out of order games on the floor is pretty embarrassing.  Lastly, the prizes, I'm a big fan of the ticket games because I like redeeming for prizes.   I go to the \"Winner's Circle\" area with prizes and was very disappointed. The shelves were mostly bare with hardly and good prizes. The ones I was interested in were ridiculously over-valued, like 50,000 tickets for Rock Em Sock Em robots, which are worth about $15.   I like coming to Dave and Buster's on occasion but they really need to improve on their service, prizes and maintaining the games on the floor."}
{"text":"Blah. Mediocre, if it was free. Expensive food and not that good. Games were ok. I would not recommend compared to other arcades"}
{"text":"Way Cool Games!!! I feel like a kid again whenever I go to a Dave and Buster's! PacMan, Space Invaders, Galaga....what year is it? They have quite a few classic games on steroids plus tons of newer games to play. We didn't eat here but the food smelled good."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak, shrimp and lobster linguine with green chimichurri sauce on the side. I requested the  steak to be cooked medium rare. Unfortunately, it took a butcher's knife and alot of elbow grease to properly cut this. Flavour was good but the tough chewy texture of the steak ruined the whole entree.  What's worse, I had already sent back the tomato bisque soup.  It tasted worse than if it had come from an expired Campbell's soup can, with bits of tomato & who knows what floating all over the place.  My mate's quesadilla looked really horrid as well - texture & presentation similar to that of prepackaged slices of cheese glued to cardboard.   Even worse,  there were four lady bartenders and they were agonizingly behind on allll the drink orders. I did,  however, enjoy the drinks but, be warned, that many are just watered down, sugared up & made with little alcohol. I do love their signature pineapple upside down shots tho! They definitely have a kick to them!    Well, what can I say... service was okay.  I'd be back to watch sports on the big screens,  try some different drinks/meals, and definitely play the arcade! I have a soft spot for Dave & busters already.  I think I'll just have to be a little bit more forward with the waitress next time e. g. \"I'd really like the steak done medium rare because in the past it's come out a little tough... really appreciate it if you'd check on that, mmmkay!!!!\" (shoutout to office space & south Park lovers!)  On the plus side:   1 - Margaritas are good.  a little on the weak,  sugary side. I'd recommend you make it a double :) The upside down pineapple shooters are sweet & strong so give them a try too!   2 - Ordered dessert to go. Enjoyed the butterscotch brownie cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Really enjoying this place.  My son's was invited to a birthday party.  The food was great with tons of options from mega burgers to many different salad's.   Recommend for nice hangout while kids have a blast."}
{"text":"First time at Dave & Buster's and although I didn't go for the games, I was slightly disappointed. I went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks. The service was slow but the food was decent. The portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain.         We went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kids there on a Friday night. I do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9."}
{"text":"This place was fun aside from the bartender. Being a bartender myself I know my liquors. I asked for a Patron reposado and received a patron blanco. When I asked our bartender Lauren if she was sure this was correct she assured me it was reposado even though anyone with eyes could see it was not. Later on my husband ordered a sea monster drink solely for the purpose of getting the sea monster that comes with it. He got it and the sea monster was broken. When he asked if he could have one that was not broken he was told \"just super glue it\". I'm sorry but this is just being plain lazy. I understand this bartender was pregnant, but lying to your customers about what you're pouring and giving defective products is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ima come clean I don't fuck with the lighting but I guess it could be a slave ship word da mommy  so ya juss gotta smile and that's word to my Dawg Juan chick"}
{"text":"The bartenders at this place are extremely rude. Came here and by far had the worst service, almost seemed as they wanted to avoid helping out our party."}
{"text":"Had our daughters birthday here. They were very organized with all details. Our server Kiki (keekee?) was super nice and friendly. I ordered the sampler plates for the table which were good. I ordered the nachos for myself which were awful. Everyone had a good time. It's a fun place."}
{"text":"One star is a major exaggeration--the service and quality of the food was much worse than this. The food is wretched--I mean, when you take an 11-year old, and he says the food is disgusting, you know you've hit the culinary bottom. We asked for nutrition information, and the answer we received was, \"no, we don't have that, and we cannot guarantee what's in the food.\" Is that even legal in this day and age? The server seemed overwhelmed with the many (3) tables he had, and sighed and shambled about any time we asked for anything (like, lemons and plates). Save yourself the trip and the tip--eat a Lean Cuisine. Those are terrible as well, but at least your expectation is low going in. And for the cost, the food should've been at least edible."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential to be 5 Star, they have completely gone down hill over the past few years. Watered down drinks, cold food, and mediocre to non-existent service. The games are always fun for an hour or so -although the arcade area is always full chaos. The food and drinks don't make up for the chaos headache that hits 15-20 minutes in."}
{"text":"Great drinks, amazing staff, but these are the saddest nachos I've ever eaten... menu nachos looked waaaay better and said served 3-4... no way in hell."}
{"text":"Still one of the best places to go when you want to enjoy a great time with friends, family or both. They have something for everyone and even a new VR Jurassic World motion ride & first person shooter game."}
{"text":"My first time here and my husband and I sat at the bar and our bartender Lexi WAS HORRIBLE. Point blank period. I sat at the bar for a good 10 minuets before she even asked what I wanted to drink. Seemed as if she had better things to do, hardly catered to us, too busy flirting with the male patrons which is fine and all but don't forget the rest of your customers. Took her over 20 minuets to get us just RANCH claimed she \"tried\" by telling others to get it for her but ran to the back when the male patrons asked for barbecue sauce. The male bartender that covered her break or whatever was freaking AMAZING and didn't even serve me a drink and he still catered to my husbands and i needs didn't get his name though. Food was awesome (:"}
{"text":"We came here not really knowing what to expect as far as a sports bar. We were pleasantly surprised. KEVA our bartender made us feel so welcome. We loved our experience. KEVA went the extra mile for us.  Our service was outstanding. This is our football headquarters."}
{"text":"D & B is a great date night.  This location has a nice big bar and speedy service. They have a lot of extravagant looking cocktails. For example an frozen drink with barefoot rosé upside down in it... I know....  barefoot.. not worth the headache. I stuck with a vodka tonic which perfect.  Food is average bar food. Don't come expecting the moon.  Remember the good ol' days when you could play for hours at Peter piper if your mom forked out a five. Times have changed. To get a solid hour of play time here you'll need at least $20. I'm on their emailing list and they frequently offer buy 20 get 20 for game points which is the way to go.  They have so many cool new games! Including a virtual reality Jurassic Park game. You literally wear the cool thing that goes around your head and everything. Other game highlights are Mario kart & giant pac man.  Sure it's expensive, but it's not the 90s anymore and playing games here with vodka tonics is way more fun than mediocre games at cheaper spots."}
{"text":"ZERO stars if there was an option for that. We walk in at 2 PM today, Saturday. Area near the TVs was half empty tables. We sat for 5 minutes and were not acknowledged once. Three of their servers walked by us and just looked at us, not a word or a smile. We walked out, we would rather spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd D&B I ever been and finding one in charlotte when I went to visit was a must go for me. This was really big compared to the pass one that I went to. They had a bowling alley, billiard area, arcade, a eating area in the game room and a pretty good size restaurant. The service was great and the food was way better than I had remembered. I order the Philly steak and it had so much flavor and they give you a good amount of fries.   We ordered dessert I forgot what it was called but it was pretty average to me everybody else loved it. I will surely go here again if we go to charlotte."}
{"text":"So my friends and I came here expecting a good time.  We had heard many good things about it from the place in Kansas City, and being a chain, I assumed some level of quality. Well, ya know what happens when you assume.  Sure we showed up and the downstairs looked gorgeous.  Wood panelling and decor worthy of a nice place to eat.  I was impressed.  Then we chose to go upstairs where the games were. I can deal with the kids and the carnival style atmosphere.  It's what one would expect.  We belly up to the bar where we are greeted by a bartender that was very busy running an understaffed upper deck.  I understood when she took a minute to get to us and get our drink order.  Then I found out they had to change the guinness keg mid pour.  In nearly every bar I've been to, they pour out the guinness, get you a new glass and get you a fresh glass and fresh guinness.  What happened was that she finished topping off my glass and put it infront of me.  Sure, it's fine, I've drank bottom keg beer before, and even enjoy the unique flavor that they provide.  However this one I couldn't even touch.  In the process of the keg blow out, some crusty substance came out into my glass.  The bartender didn't catch it, and I had a crusty brown-yellow glob at the top of the glass.  I had to wait for her to get time to check on us.  When she finally came around, she had no problems replacing it.  Sensing issues, I requested a water as well.  The first drink of my beverage told me I needed it.  The guinness tasted old, even with a new keg.  I was sure I was drinking the old beer of many pours ago.    That being said, I went to my water.  It was poured out of the same tap several drinks were poured out of as well, which is common place in the bar industry.  What wasn't common place was the nasty flavor I got from it as well.  It was moldy flavored.  By this time we had ordered our food, so I waited for my steak to show up.  The lemon pepper 8oz.    So I ate it.  Thank goodness for a saving grace.  The steak was delicious.  I had no complaints and ate even the sides.  This is a rarity in my world, as usually I eat like a bird. My friend, who is usually hypercritical, ordered the Teriyaki steak and said his was not up to par.  So, bad beverages, good steak.  A disappointing outing for someone hosting his friends from out of town.   Hoping to save something from this, we went to see if we could play games.  I went to the booth, hoping to be able to buy tokens with cash, only to find that I would have to purchase a membership card, pay a 2 dollar signup fee and then I could put a minimum of 10 dollars on my card.  Unsure that I ever wanted to visit again, I left.  Had the place had better beer care and better care of their nozzles, I might have thought about it.  Since I didn't have a good customer experience, I will probably not be back.  Hopefully they can clean their nozzles and beer taps.  From seeing other reviews, others have had good experiences here.  For the health and safety of everyone, I hope they do and others have a better experience.  Mine was poor."}
{"text":"Spent MLK Day here with my teenage sons.  Food was good, not great.  Fairly priced.  Games were fine.  Service was excellent, very nice people.  Overall, good place to spend your time in money if you want to be indoors."}
{"text":"Went there last night and the food was mediocre. I found the game room quite mediocre also. It was quite crowded and even started to get a little warm inside. Besides being loud which I did expect being a gaming place, the restroom smelled horrible! Also, the paper towels were not on a roll but sitting on the very wet counter. As I walked out I passed two 11 yr. olds who were holding the nose while walking in."}
{"text":"My review is solely based on the arcade.   I really liked this Dave & Buster's location. It was very clean, big and there were plenty of arcade games.   It's located in Downtown Summerlin so it's a great place to go to after lunch, dinner or shopping. There's a lot of parking available. You might have to walk a bit though.   Overall I really enjoyed going to Dave & Buster's. I suggest going here if you're looking for a place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the waterfront, Dave & Buster's is definitely a household name loved by people of all ages. Tons of games, huge bars and dining. The food is awesome and service is great. Weekends are crazy busy so if you're just craving the food and a few drinks, I recommend coming in on a weeknight"}
{"text":"The games are pretty good, but the food tops out at mediocre. Everyone in our party who had vegetables received stone-cold portions. My chicken entree exhibited the same annoying flaw exhibited by chicken at many chain eateries, being bone-dry, cold, tough, and tasteless except for an overabundance of salt. The chicken had clearly been cooked at some point in the past, stored, and microwaved before serving. The service was very good and the beer selections nice. But the poor-to-mediocre food could not be overcome by these redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"If you want to spend a ton of money on food where they argue over who your waitress is going to be,  they can't provide silver ware due to people quitting this is the place for you.   Then,  to go to the arcade and spend more time finding workers to credit your card back for non functioning games is extremely frustrating.   It was so bad I eventually asked the manager just to refund my card because it had gotten so ridiculous.   Over 20 minutes waiting for a credit for a broken game.   Horrible experience.   Stay home eat take out and play PS4.  The manager John wonders around like he's herding cats because the chaos is overwhelming."}
{"text":"Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!"}
{"text":"This place is a MESS. It seems incredibly disorganized, like no one know's what they're doing or what's going on. The restaurant was completely empty yet we were told it was an hour and a half to two hour wait. I'm not exaggerating, there was one table in the area they were referring to that we couldn't be seated. There were also an incredible amount of employees just standing around.  They had a looong line to buy tickets, and when you get to the front the man working would conveniently tell you at that time that the line was for cash only, no debit. You think they could tell you before you spend all that time in that long line, to be referred to another longer line.  The food was OK (I'm being nice here), their mac and cheese barely tasted like cheese. The tater tots were good, but its kind of hard to screw that up. Very basic, overpriced frozen food. Nothing even close to special or even close to being worth the money.  The only thing worth mentioning was the bartender, and I wish I got her name. She was an older lady with glasses, but she was amazing. Sweet, friendly, and attentive despite it being busy around her. I asked if they had vanilla coke and she said no, but would try to make me one - and made an amazing one at that.   You can tell she really cares about her job, her guests, and about her service. If it wasn't for her, this place wouldn't have deserved a star. She deserves five stars, everything else deserves nothing."}
{"text":"Lunchtime at westgate and heard this location recently opened . One of there signature meals was recommended and being that I love Mac n cheese went with my gut instinct. This Mac n cheese has its own ingredients of bacon, steak and chicken pieces. The meal came out quickly and the flavors on top of the Mac n cheese were very crispy and just how I like it ."}
{"text":"After this first time visit I decided that I need to start doing these reviews, a lot.  First off, the building and the interior is great, inviting, and great for a sports bar type setting with some great looking games in the back and our waitress was bomb (I forgot her name but she had lined tats on the right arm, facial piercings, and a purple streak in her hair. She is awesome, tip her well), the rest goes straight down the toilet as fast as drinking beer then eating taco bell.  I will start with the food. Bruh, the food is expensive and basic. We started with the burger sliders deal and I kid you not it looked like they went out and got some frozen White Castle burgers and then charged you $12 because they put a toothpick in the top with a cherry tomato and a pickle. This can't be White Castle though because White castle is actually good. We had a large group and ordered a ton of other food to which they all thought it was pretty basic for half the price, and downright nasty for the price.   I like my booze so I went to the bar to get a double Jack and coke, the bartender who was clearly ready to get out of there and totally snooty told me that they are not allowed to sell doubles...In Wisconsin, in freaking Wisconsin they are not allowed to sell doubles so I asked for a large glass, ordered two singles and dumped them into the larger cup. The prices aren't that bad though but there is a reason for that, so that you get hammered enough to not see how your wallet is getting destroyed by the stupidly expensive games.  The games: Couple of good shooters, the 4D horror game is cool, the rest is pretty much standard Chuck E Cheese except you buy a \"Power Card\" for a couple bucks and then buy chips to use for the games. We were there with a lot of children in our group and they all got $20 put on their cards. I am not joking when I say that within under ten minutes they all needed a refill LOL and we didn't believe them until we saw they were broke. The games are stupid, stupid expensive and when they see you are doing well, such as the shooter games, they basically say \"LOL, bruh, time for some cheap shots cause we needs all yo money\"...and you are dead so you need to reinsert their robbery card again.  If you want a cool sports bar with good food then don't go here, don't take your kids here because they will ruin your nest egg in minutes because of how expensive it is. I suggest you move on just like this place will in a year."}
{"text":"So disgusting!!  Restaurant service was horrible! Grizzle on our taco meat.  Wilty and brown lettuce on our Caesar salad.  Hard to get refills.  Horrible customer service!  Will NEVER eat here again!!"}
{"text":"No paper towels, toilet paper, or soap in the women's bathroom. Place seems a bit dirty. This place needs better management."}
{"text":"We had a large group here and were served appetizer type food (wings) while people went off to play games. The games were interesting in some areas, for about five minutes. The food? Well, think about this. You are TOUCHING surfaces that are coated with about 100 layers of kiddy snot, and when was the last time you noticed a kid (or a 18 yr old for that matter) wash their hands after using the lavatory? You haven't and they didn't, so anything you touch is contaminated with a veritable petri dish of bacterial pathogens. Then you are going to eat FINGER FOOD? Bad idea....so I didn't eat and guess what? I was fine the next day, which I could not say for a number of our party who did not study biology in college as I did.  They didn't feel so good. . Just DON'T EAT and you'll be find. And don't touch your face...carry handwipes. You get the picture."}
{"text":"Expensive but good food and environment.  Games are cool as well but VERY pricey.  I would recommend it  if you just got paid."}
{"text":"This place is a good time. It's like a big carnival for grownups...games and beer and big televisions and yummy greasy bar fries. It's not really the kind of place where I'd go on my own, but it's nice when you are out with a few couples. Men like to play games. Women like to make fun of men playing games. It's interesting.  I've been having a little issue with hot fudge sundaes lately. (I wonder if there's a 12 step group for this problem?) Dave and Busters has a fantastic one on the dessert menu that features a chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"This place is super fun! Great place to hang out after shopping or dining at Downtown Summerlin.  It's obviously catered more for adults, but kids & toddlers have a great time as well =)"}
{"text":"I must have come here at least half a dozen times in my life and I never have a bad time at D&B.  This past weekend we came for a party and they had a deal with a magic show and all you can play for $20!!!. The show was entertaining and the games are as fun as ever.   Now the food is mediocre and there was even a fire that started in the arcade, but with all that I still had a blast.  I hope this place never closes"}
{"text":"Came here for my son's birthday. Waited 20 minutes for our drinks and an additional 49 minutes for our food. The waitstaff really didn't appreciate having to take breaks from their cellphones to seat/serve us. Had to ask over and over for drinks, water, silverware....etc. I could understand if they were busy, but it wasn't at all.   I ordered the sirloin, which was poorly kept/cooked. The food wasn't very good at all.   Games were fun...as always. Eat before you come to play!"}
{"text":"This place has been a nostalgic go to. Today I made the mistake of taking my 3 young boys here. No joke, 1 in 3 games was out of order. We spent $40 and actually left with $10 in credit. I remember going here regularly 5-10 years ago and it was awesome. Today, it legit felt like it was going out of business."}
{"text":"It's an arcade that also has a bar, and food. It's also got a TON of hype, and quite a cost to go along with it.  It's cool to come and spend $10 - $20 on arcade games to pass some time with friends. Not something to do all the time, as it could get old quick. The prizes aren't anything crazy cool or out of the ordinary from your usual upscale arcade, and for the amount of money you need to spend to win the amount of tickets for the large prizes is absurd, of course that goes without say though. They have to make money somehow.  The food is delicious! Absolutely! Though it is quite expensive for some higher-end-like bar food. The specialty alcoholic beverages are pretty cool, too, though again... the cost isn't something that's at all appetizing.  Over-hyped. Still fun."}
{"text":"I have not been here for a LONG time.  We had some time to kill so us three \"adult\" kids went to have some fun.  We went upstairs and there are tons of kid games.  It is like Vegas for kids.  Everything dings and makes sounds.  You win tickets...to get prizes.  I played the throwing balls at these clown like pop up dolls.  My max was 300 point, can't get over the hump.  We played some basketballs hoops, I suck!  Shutting off lights, I am slow...  Then racing car games.  It was fun to be a kid for a couple of hours.  We went to the bar to get a drink.  Not one staff was tending the bar.  But a tons of managers, assistant managers, servers, etc.  No bartender.  After a 5 min wait, she showed up but she was already busy.  After 5 to 7 mins pass by, then finally she came over.  We ordered and she got our drinks without a smile or anything.  Geez... It is the service industry... Hello and a smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"Came here recently for a party. Why people come here to eat food is beyond me. The food was below average at best. The fries were way underdone and raw. The chips were stale. The burger was ok. The brownie explosion desert was decent, but the ice cream was old and icy. It was probably the worst ice cream I have had a restaurant/bar. The games are all ok, but half of them don't work and the card readers are so trash, you have to insert your card a few times for the machines to recognize your card. I would never come to this place if I have to pay. Maybe play pool, but skip everything else."}
{"text":"Last day in Arizona before heading back to Vegas..stopped here to have dinner with our friends and their 2 grandbabies..1st off, our waiter was very nice..but not so attentive. Waited almost an hour for our food when other tables waited on by him got their food in 15 minutes..drinks weren't filled and when asked for refills it took another 10 minutes before we got them..so finally our food comes and by this time the kids are getting restless..every single plate of ours was COLD..not even luke warm..not to mention he forgot one of the kids plate, and all we ordered was hot dogs!  No one enjoyed their meal and when asked \"how was your dinner?\", we'll I couldn't lie! All the hostess could say was \"oh, I'm sorry\"! Very dissatisfied and disappointed in this place! I can honestly say..Las Vegas has the BEST service hands down!"}
{"text":"Compared to other Dave and busters this may not be the greatest arcade/pub but they do price there games 1/2 off every Wednesday so if you don't want children running around unsupervised then I would suggest going at that time on a school day. The thing I would have to complain the most about is there low ticket jackpots compared to other arcades I've been to."}
{"text":"D&B's FINALLY makes it Vegas debut and luckily, it's not on The Strip. Love that it's in a local neighborhood!   Came on opening night, which was obviously busy. But not too busy where we could quickly sit at the bar for some drinks.  It was happy hour to $1 off wines and draft beers. Also half off liquor! Chachiiiiiiing*****  I wasn't hungry but ordered wine and the roomies ordered draft beers. The beers came in big glasses and I swear there were 10 bartenders at the bar! lol at least 2 different bartenders were asking us if we needed help.  Although we didn't eat, the BBQ ribs the guy next to us was eating smelled hella bomb.   There were numerous, and I DO MEAN NUMEROUS --- maybe 8 to be exact --- tvs at the bar, along with on the restaurant walls. Almost felt like I was at a sports book. We watched a few rounds of Olympics water polo matches before playing some games.   I got an email from DT Summerlin for their opening earlier in the day which gave a coupon for $20 worth of gaming with $20 card purchase.  We redeemed that and paid an extra $2 for the card itself.  All the workers are still learning so that whole card purchase took some time.  She also mentioned for an extra $6, we could get 50 extra chips/play in our card -- ok, sure; why not.   All in all the boys played few rounds of basketball, skeeball, and air hockey. There were so much of each game that the wait, if any, wasn't too long.   Excited to have D&Bs here and can't wait to try the food next time."}
{"text":"2 stars. Don't get me wrong the deals of the week are great, the games are FUN & the food is yummy... BUT THE SERVICE!! Oh don't even get me started. I've been here 2 times in the past week and there service is all around DISORGANIZED! It took 25 min for someone just to come and get our drink orders! Seriously...after getting our drinks another 20 min for someone to come and order our food. I don't understand why they would have a whole section open to just ONE server?! Especially when you know Happy Hour is gonna be busy. I recommend anyone coming to find somewhere else to eat because you'll be spending half your time here waiting for someone to help you."}
{"text":"The waiters are so uninterested in what you want and aren't willing to sub with any flexibility of the combo platters -which are terrible in pairing to begin with. Don't get a blended drink. They're all ice and you can't even drink it through a straw-not even an hour later when it was melting.   We got instead of a combo platter, boneless wings and the spinach dip. Both were decent. Like everyone says the food here is honestly worse than Denny's. I don't get it. For the price and no good deals, especially for being Father's Day....   I didn't mind the açaí drink. It was pretty cool instead of my frozen ice cubed mango daiquiri. The three frozen ice cubes took up my whole drink. I honestly don't think they use liquor here."}
{"text":"3 stars for the following reasons: We do love the location, the games and the 2 floors with bowling and dining downstairs and the gaming upstairs.  The drinks are hit or miss. They had a really great bartender that ended up going to the westgate location so they will have the best drinks from my opinion. The food is ok. We used to love the Calamari and then they got cheap and I can basically count how much is on the plate. You get onions galore though. The only food I suggest are the wings and the sliders.  Last night 1-28-17 my fiance and I went here for my b-day and he had the sirloin tips and I had the bacon wrapped shrimp with steak. The food was horrible! His meat was edible but not flavorful. My meat was rubber. I ordered it medium and i couldn't even finish it. I had about 4 bites and I was done even trying to eat it. My shrimp was rough as well. Only thing I enjoyed was my corn and mashed potatoes. My drink was super sweet but I drank it.  As far as the staff, the bartender was ok. My finances drink took 10 min because they were waiting for a glass to be washed so he could get his drink.  The 3 stars is for the drinks that are ok sometimes, the sliders which i do enjoy when I order them and the games."}
{"text":"Came here for a UFC fight and was completely disappointed. They were only showing it in two areas, one was a room with a bad screen and uncomfortable chairs lined up the other was upstairs in an outside seating area. The outside seating area had no sound and they served only appetizers. Sad! Oh and the other room had no food allowed. Will never go there for a fight again. Desert Ridge D&B is 1000 times better.  They get the two stars for their Coronaritas, delicious, saved the fight night."}
{"text":"Went with about 10 people (no kids) for a birthday.  3 of us stayed at the table with their beers, and the rest had fun playing the games.  It's not quite as lame as some may say it is.  You can really have some fun playing the games and winning tickets.  But I'll admit it won't please everyone.  I'd go back.....but would hand-pick the people I invite....."}
{"text":"I don't know- I don't know- who can think amidst the loud clanking noises and flashing lights?!  Plus, trying to figure out the pricing of cost of $ vs the # of points u get vs the meal package that comes with a power card plus the cost of super charge. Get me a drink already!  Maybe this is their ploy all along. LOL.  I got a little dizzy from trying to figure it all out. In the end, I opted for the $25 card buy 4 and get 175 points. You supposedly get 25% more play. Not sure if that matters since each game takes a different amount (not posted on the machines) so it's not like you can plan your play. And $25 worth of play goes quick. In about an hour in fact.  The food is good, better than typical arcade food. There is a bowling alley. The y also have 1/2 price play on Wed. and HH.  Place is fun for both kids and big kids who are mistakenly called grown ups. It's a fun place but if you are sitting upstairs don't expect to have a conversation with screaming to be heard amidst all the noise!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that the food was terrible.  My husband had gone several months ago with people from work & said his hamburger was good. I'd equate it to the stuff you find at Circle K.  All three of us had bad food. But that is not what caused my stomach to do flip flops. After we placed our order, our waitress bussed the booth behind us.  She swept a broom across the table, then the booths.  She followed that up with a damp cloth.  I am certain that this was not some special broom used only to clean tables.  The reason?  She brought it to the table along with the long handled matching dustpan. I've never seen such a filthy practice.  These people need sanitation handling!"}
{"text":"I witnessed something I'd never seen before.  Our waitress \"cleaned up\" the table behind us by sweeping a broom over it, as well as the booth seats.  I know it was the same broom used on the floor because she brought it to the table with the matching handled dust pan.  This is clearly an extremely unsafe practice.  She followed it up with a wet rag. My stomach did flip flops, and I wanted to leave but we had already ordered and my husband had a plane to catch. Food was mediocre and equivalent to buying processed junk at Circle K.  My Thai salad was clearly salad straight from the bag with tiny nuggets of chicken about the size you'd give to a very small dog.  No peanuts and dressing was non-existent.  My husband's turkey sandwich was simply a few pieces of lunchmeat rolled up and slathered with mayo.  My kid's chicken fingers were small pieces of chicken encased in a lot of breading.  One of the worst dining experiences ever!  Amazing too because my husband said he had a really good burger here when he went with coworkers when they were considering D&B for an office party."}
{"text":"Out family loves it! We don't eat the food but we bowl and play games on Wednesday. All the games and bowling are half off on Wednesdays!!!"}
{"text":"The reason they got 1 star is because the lights were on and the doors were open. What a complete waste of our time as we tried to watch some NFL games. The bartenders downstairs ignored us for 15 minutes.. we asked if the Raider game was on and the GM told me he couldn't get that game. Mind you it was on CBS. Then we finally got the game on and was told we needed to move to restaurant side to watch it. We then waiting 35 minutes just to get a menu and the waiter ( who was clueless) never came back. Don't waste your time at this place. Managers were worse than the minimum wage employees!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but we asked a waiter to help one of our friends that had just shown up, his comment was \"do you have a tab at the bar? I can't help you\" and then he walked away. Our friend had no tab at the bar. When we told the manager he said \"sorry about that.\" Our second waiter was really nice though."}
{"text":"3 words.....understaffed, unwelcoming and slow service. Ok 4 words...but none good.....We will NOT be coming back until that has been resolved! Waited almost 2 hours for a table, yes we had a big party, but for such a big place and on a Saturday night they should have been more prepared. Then we ordered, drinks first then food, we waited 25 minutes for our drinks, when we asked why it was taking so long our server apologized and said they were behind in making the drinks, I said making them, half of them our coronas???!!!!! Next the food was all brought out 1 @ a time, my sister received her appetizer and entree all @ once, while the rest of us sat and waited. If it wasn't for our great company and for our families way of making fun of this service we were receiving, we never would have stayed, but we made it through, but will NOT be coming back! IF MANAGEMENT, OWNER OR ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT WORKING HERE, READS THIS PLEASE GET BETTER SERVERS, HOSTS,BARTENDERS, DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND FIX THIS PLACE! IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL, BUT NEEDS HELP!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding party meet up there and they sat and served us with no worries. Food was great and quick. We all enjoyed the game room and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is the first Dave & Buster's I've been too and my friends and I had a lot of fun here. We arrived around 8pm and stayed for about  2 hours. The staff was pretty busy since a UFC fight was going on and the place was packed. We signed up for their card and put about $12 bucks on the cards which lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. We ordered some drinks from the bar in the back and they were pretty good. I had a berry red bull drink that was just the right amount of alcohol to make the night that much more enjoyable. I enjoyed a variety of games and liked that they had newer stuff out there (new Jurassic Park game was awesome). Overall, it was fun and relaxing. I will definitely check out some of the Dave & Busters in my own area back here in CA soon!"}
{"text":"Went in with my two adult sons. It was busy but not the bar. So we sat at the bar and we're served our beer quickly. But that was the last time we were noticed by the bartender. Had to get up and get my own menus. We decided what we wanted but could not get the bartender...bar only had 6 people sitting. So we moved to the restaurant and had lunch...After lunch we hit the game room which was a mistake. The three of us got the lunch special with the game card....Every game we played was  miscalibrated...Aim was off on all the games.. basketballs all needed air. Missing skeeballs....I thought Dave and Busters was supposed to cater more to adults...but it just looked like chunky cheese. Way to many kids running around without parents..."}
{"text":"Best Dave n' Busters I have been to. The food was actually really good. We had delicious drinks for happy hour and it was really well priced. The arcades were great also. Well kept. Will definitely be coming here again with friends!"}
{"text":"This week I took over 30 Beta Club students to D & B. My students had a great time. We had an eat and play package and had a blast.  Students were served a buffet of mini cheese pizzas, French fries, cheese burger sliders, Mac n cheese, and chicken strips. Food and service were both excellent.   Students got a game Card with a $20 credit. Students can play all \"blue\" games free. Green games cost money on the card.  All in all a great place for fun and games."}
{"text":"The arcade area is the best part. It's a good place to bring some friends and play. But the service in the restaurant area is so slow!!! Eat in somewhere else before come here if you are hungry or thirsty. Or sit in the bar."}
{"text":"To be honest, this place is way too much fun and looks way to good and up to date to have such bad service.  Went to D&B last week, requested a table from the host. He told us there were no tables available and to sit at a table in the game room and see if a server would come around and serve us there.  I walked around the dining area and found three available tables and went back to the host who then seated us, grudgingly so.  When we sat the person who came to serve us said that they were just covering someone else and that he would not be our server, but proceeded to take our drink and food order.   Our drinks came immediately but our appetizer came about twenty minutes later which was standard. We were not given any utensils, plates or even ketchup and there was no server around to ask so I literally had to get up myself and take these things from another table.  No exaggeration, our main entrees did not come for at least another 30 minutes, and only came when I physically walked up to another server and asked if she knew where our food was. Our food (footlong & philly cheese sandwich) finally came out, COLD. AND on top of that, the fries were missing! We waited another 15 minutes just in case it was on it's way and it never came! Flagged down a server, who didn't even apologize just said \"That's weird\". The sides finally came, again, COLD.  Needless to say, we weren't very happy and I promise you I am not the type of person to make a big fuss over things so we didn't even say anything just paid for our bill, didn't leave a tip, and left.  The game room seems to be the only redeeming factor to this place which is a HUGE shame because otherwise this place would've been perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here and it has been decent and good at times. Took a group vote and went here on a Sunday afternoon. I went to the bar first and got a shot, but kind of took a minute for them to get it to us. Well, after that everyone showed up and we got seated quickly. Our waiter's name was Kendal and dude was nice, polite, and professional. I didn't have to wait long for my drink to get filled up so that's a PLUS!    For food,  I ordered the ribs and wings. Wings were alright, nothing over the top. The ribs on the other hand was very moist and juicy with every bite, I was pleasantly surprised by that. After that we went into the arcade. Played some basketball. They also had a sand board game which was cool and little pool hall next to it. So, its a nice place to come and play some games and just relax with good company!"}
{"text":"So the game selection is awesome, but it's clear that the staff is all brand new. We tried a huge portion of the cocktail list and nothing on it was good. The food was okay? Not good. The staff was nice, but we had to wait two hours before anything was bussed (3+ for the unattended tables around us). Our server was nice, but we had multiple issues including her telling us that the manager was not allowing us to take the \"sea monster\" figures in the tiki drinks despite it saying that these were included on the website AND the menu.  Also, 10 minutes before closing there was a \"last call\" for games and despite the fact that some games (that you paid for as a patron) lasted more than ten minutes there were police officers and staff that stood behind you with folded arms (do they pay you extra for that?)  Anyway, I'd take Gamework's customer service and drink selection over Dave and Buster's any day. Unfortunately I still have credits on my Dave and Buster's card... Does any one want it? Selling for cheap."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't eat here. Service is horrible. Food is terrible.  Came here with a group of 10 and waited 2 hours before the food came out! Totally unacceptable. Worst part was that the server continuously told us that the food was on its way. Our group intended to play anyways, she at least could have been truthful and have us play during those 2 hours and give us a call when the food came. Nope.   I ordered the chicken Ceasar salad. Literally romaine lettuce with a frozen chicken breast on top, yet it costs $20.  Will never come back here again to the dining area."}
{"text":"Apparently you Must get a reservation. Tried this place a 2nd time. It was around 3 pm and it was only half as busy as the first time we went, there were at least 4-6 empty booths in the restaurant and we were still quoted a 2 hour wait. I can understand that for the huge table in the middle that was reserved for a party, but not having all those tables sitting empty while people are standing there waiting. Seems very much like a ploy to get you to play games while you wait, but we just left. Might give them one more typical down the road but if it's just like the first two times we'll be done with them."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Dave and Buster's for a date night on a Friday.  I anticipated the place being full of obnoxious kids running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but luckily, that was not the case.  We got a card and loaded it with $20, got a couple of beers (only one local beer on tap-Kiltlifter) and proceeded to play the night away.  I am a total trivia buff so I loved playing the trivia game (and beating everyone who sat down at the game with me.)  I also loved the ski ball game and the basketball game.  We played a couple of games of air hockey too.  We especially loved that a girl that worked there kept coming around and giving us tokens to play a coin game where you can win a lot of tickets.  We called her \"The Coin Fairy.\"  She visited us a couple of times and gifted us with tokens, which made my husband very happy."}
{"text":"Our server was horrible, but after talking to manager he was able to fix everything. Shameka and Vanessa were very helpful at the front with tickets and games. What turned out to be a horrible experience at first with getting charged additional drinks and getting no appetizer turned out to be great after all at the end."}
{"text":"I'm not planning to ever go back to this place. It is insanely overpriced. $20 worth of credits will last one person literally 7 minutes!. Even the more fun action games last less than a minute without you adding more credits. Yes I know most arcades are that way but usually kids can get enough tokens to kill at least a half hour to 45 minutes! Years ago D&B used to have virtual reality type attractions in addition to the games and those were more adult oriented and fun. That's what I expected this time instead of a bunch of claw machines and roulette type games.  Although they advertise games and suggest it as a place for all ages, it's really more of a teens and 20's date night kind of thing. On the other hand, what teen has enough money to keep their date entertained at those prices? The prizes, yes I realize they are typically cheap in an arcade type place, but these were so cheap that kids couldn't even find a couple trinkets and an adult would find nothing at all since even the candy is too too many tickets. Hundreds of tickets for one, very small, piece of candy, holy cow!  It's not for kids because of the prices. It's not for teens because of the prices and it's not for older adults, who could afford it, because of the games, so I guess it's for 20 somethings with a lot of money? Personally, I would spend $60 or so and buy a new video game rather than blow that much in a half hour (excluding food) at D&B and have nothing to show for it, but a not memorable memory. I wasn't even inclined to buy the food, since my credits didn't last long enough to stay for food. I was only there for 30 minutes or so!  If I EVER went back it would be to try the food and drinks, sans the games, but since they don't have any kind of food reputation, why would I?"}
{"text":"Food was great - lots of selection.  Happy hour menu wasn't worth it, it's just a mini/single individual portion (like tapas), it was tasty though.  We ordered one of each - tacos, shrimp, sliders, bang bang chicken, etc.  I would only order the chicken, tacos and the artichoke dip again, the rest I would order from the regular menu.  Drinks were great - happy hour 1/2 off cocktails.  It was Monday night football so they had the game on the many large screens they have. It was viewable from any location.  It was self-seating, so hard for the server to determine who was already seated and who just sat. As a result, I sat for awhile before finally flagging down a server.  That could use improvement.  Once getting service, he did his best to provide great service. I don't think it was him but it was slow between when he could help us.    The powercard and all the different offers became confusing - from the online sign-up offer, to the food/card combo, to credits from purchasing food, to getting a card... I finally figured it out with the help of a few other customers and the information desk.  The game play area is dark and a bit noisy (could be with age that it bugs me now).  My daughter loved it - an upgrade from Chuck E Cheese, but way more expensive.  I would recommend going on Wednesdays when games are 1/2 off. They get you since you buy credits and games cost credits instead of $$ so you don't realize the game could be $1.75 to play."}
{"text":"Horrible service , most of the games didn't work awful experience for my first time here. Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"I came here today with some friends to unwind. I love how you have the option to order food and drinks in a relaxed location that has so much to do. I haven't played arcade games in years (and I was terrible at it) but I had a blast. The food was great and the portions were huge!!! Everything was very reasonably priced as well. I'm not a huge sports person but they have lots of tvs up with various sports playing if that's your thing. I also very much enjoyed the fact that even though they had music playing it wasn't super loud and I could still carry on a conversation. I know that makes me sound old but it was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Hits a grate place many things to do  Kids play food bars really nice  There customer service is great  You can pick a table with no problem  Love it ::::::::)))))))))))))))))))))"}
{"text":"I bring my daughter here on wednesdays since it's half off games. We easily spend 4 hours here at a given time. That way momma gets a cocktail and kids have a blast. I can be pretty competitive at ski ball so I will take on anyone. The food is comfort food and is always great! Nations are HUGE!!!  I've done bowling a couple times and I must say, either I suck or the lanes are crooked. I'm going with the crooked lane theory!"}
{"text":"\"happy hour drinks is bomb!!!!!!!\" happy hour food not so much!"}
{"text":"Dave and Busters is a great place to go and have some food and kill some time playing video games.  their food is pretty good - typical Americana fare.  their burgers are good and the service is pretty good.  I don't go here expecting a gourmet meal but I am never let down.  Their selection of video games isn't huge but you will be able to find a couple games you like.  They run great deals and you can get an Eat and Play deal for $15 which includes $10 in games - not bad!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced on games and food. Had a $20 free gameplay and still paid $26 and took no time to redeem them. And wasn't busy at all yet we didn't get refills on my water. It would be nicer if didn't need to speed over $100 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Really great place to have drinks and get together with friends! I have had a work party here and ever since I thought it was a great place to have fun... The deals with the food and game tokens are great. You can spend $50 and play for hours, it's a great date place or double date for that matter.  The prizes to pick from are alright, the shot glasses are cute, but I'd save and get something big!  Overall, really like D&B, you guys should too!   ps. Sign up on their website and get $10 in free game tickets!"}
{"text":"This review is solely about the food portion of this location and not the arcade as they have one of the best arcades next to Gameworks in the valley.  I used to go to DB's all the time when I lived in Honolulu,Hawaii and the food was very very good and I could never get enough.When I visited the DB's in Boise,Idaho the food was very good as well but it was a great experience too.  Last night I went to DB's in Summerlin,Nevada and it was a huge nightmare. The tortilla chips they served us to dip in the artichoke dip were STALE! The brought out another set of chips and a few of them were fresh and good but the rest again were STALE!I ordered the Pepperoni Pretzel Bites and those were dry and might be the worst appetizer I have ever had in my life. The Marinara sauce was cold and not good at all. We tried this pizzadilla item and they brought it out and it was dry and disgusting. We asked for a manager and he made us a new one with more sauce but the sauce was cold and didn't make this pizzadilla item any better. The service was horrible too and as quickly as possible we just got our check and paid and left."}
{"text":"Great place, games are a lot of fun and on Wednesday it's half price games!! The food is bar food, great place for some dessert, but it is what it is a very fun place!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the soft opening and it was AMAZING! I signed up a few weeks ago to preview this location an I was glad I did! They offered a full buffet of their catering menu and desserts. Everything I tried was great. They offered salad, slaw, chips and dip, meatballs, jalapeño poppers, grilled shrimp skewers, burger sliders, grilled chicken, and steak along with a huge variety of steaks. They also offered $10 in tokens for games and two signature drinks to try as well. The staff was super friendly and attentive for this event. It's a Dave and Busters, so of course they have a ton of games and TVs. The restaurant isn't open yet, so of course it was really clean. I'll definitely be going back to update my review with the standard customer experience as well."}
{"text":"Very poor service. The bartender Auriel would rather do anything than actually serve someone a drink. We waited for 10 minutes for our 1st drink, and we were the only people at the bar. And for our 2nd drink we waited 15 minutes while she talked to a fellow employee and ignored us, I'm assuming hoping that we'd just go away.   Overall I love the games and the concept of the place, but our service is just absolutely horrible. If you hate your job that much, get a ne"}
{"text":"3.5 I'm honestly not sure what I was expecting since it was a D&B but here we go.   Service: The hostess was a bit absent minded. She sent us upstairs (with a baby in a stroller mind you) to go to a table that was available but we get up there were none available. So back down we go. Our friends with the baby were obviously quite annoyed. We get seated and our server is also really slow but nice. He even offered to split mine and my bfs meal on two plates since we were sharing, which was a nice touch.   Food: We ordered apps. Pretzels were just ok, but my friends loved the potato poppers (& $1 to make a wish left a good warm feeling). I also got the tortilla soup which was yummy. Now my steak, which as previously mentioned they split for free and separated for us (very nice), was unfortunately cold, really rare (asked for med rare) and so gristley I could hardly eat it.   Drinks: I ordered some cherry adult beverage (cherry mojito?) that was really good.   Games: The usual, but they weigh the tickets instead of count them and that may be cheating... Tickets are worth 2 so I hope they double the weight!"}
{"text":"My family and I meet for a fun Sunday early dinner with my Aunt and Uncle and there family.  It was the perfect half way point for everyone. There was 11 of us total 6 adulta 5 kids.  At 4:45 we got put on a waiting list. They said 30 minutes. We finally got seated a hour later.  Our waitress seemed inexperienced.  The way she took our order was just odd.  Many people had to yell across the table. We waited about 30 minutes and then our food came out slowly. 5 meals came out. First mistake was one of the burgers which was suppose to have bbq sause on it did not have any one it.  Ok no big deal.  Our waitress is no were to be found. About 10 minutes goes by and finally the rest of the food comes out. My Aunts steak salad was suppose to be medium well. It was rare and bloody. I got the philly cheese steak with no mushrooms.  It come out with nothing but meat and bun.  We sent both meals back.  About 5 minutes later the food came back. My Aunts steak had been taken off the salad and put back on the grill.  The put back on here salad.  My cheese steak got some cold onions and green peppers thrown on top. Again I went looking for our waitress who was no wear to be found.  So I found a manager.   After explaining everything to him he disappeared for a while.  Finally our waitress came back and told me what he was going to do. Mind you everyone was done eatting at this point.  They wanted to remake meal for me. I said no just take it off my bill so they did and gave everyone 20% off which we would have gotten either way since my husband was in the military and they give a 20% discount.  Then the manager came back over and said he was giving us unlimited play for the rest of the night which he failed to mention it was on non ticket games.  Needless to say if you are a party of 5 dont bother going to eat here. I do understand things happen especially in bigger groups but service was horrible our waitress blamed the cooks and never omce checked up on us."}
{"text":"I'm ADDICTED! Vegas needs MORE!!!  Concept is great.  You purchase a card that you can reload anytime and that is what you use for the games. Your tickets are automatically stored on there. Great idea.  Games are AMAZING. Favorite is monopoly and jurassic park. My son LOVES it. My siblings and I (all 21+) LOVE IT.  An hour and a half felt like 15 minutes!  Food: Not the best food ever but the potato chips are SPECTACULAR. Fresh and house made. Great seasoning. Not too salty, right amount of flavor and crunch."}
{"text":"Food is okay . if you sit at the bar to eat prepare for some poor service. They do not care about you if you aren't drinking. When there is no seats left I dread sitting at the bar, they could care less about refilling your drinks if it isn't alcohol."}
{"text":"Too bad we don't have one of these in Tucson.  The games were pretty fun.  I think they have something for everyone.  I just wish the food tasted a little better.  I ordered the Philly cheesesteak.  It was average.  I thought there were too many green peppers."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night prepared for the game room to be crowded and the dinner wait to be an hour or more.  The game room was pretty crowded, but not as crowded as I expected. However, there were a lot of games that were out of order. And one of the games ate our tokens. Also the card readers never worked the first time and we kept having to insert the card multiple times in different directions and at different speeds until it worked. It sure why that was happening, it could have just been my card because it is a few years old. Overall, it was acceptable, we had fun, but we did get annoyed a few times. The dinner portion was below our expectations, we had a coupon and I'm glad we did. The food was fine, but definitely overpriced. I'm glad we had a coupon because I would not have paid full price for what we got. The server told us the wait would be 30 minutes but we ended up waiting an hour. Whatever estimate they give you I'd say double it and that's what you will really wait. This is based on our experience but also the experience of larger parties that were also waiting. It seems like the reason why the wait is so long is because there is a delay in bussing and cleaning tables. The service is slow but our server was very nice.  Overall, I would come back here to use my other coupon, and maybe play a few games. But it is overcrowded and overpriced. If you can deal with that you will probably enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Wednesday night. No hostess at the booth. Macaroni was just pasta. No cheese. no sauce. My mashed potatoes tasted off as well, like bleu cheese. Sticky tables. Very unsatisfied with the food."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and received wonderful service,I never ordered food here before but to night we did ribs and burger,apps so freaking good and my kids had a great time thank you your awsawsome ?"}
{"text":"Not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...  Pool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour (I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)  Mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location. The food is crap.  The games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).  That is all.  :)  (the pricing is based on my recent trip. We shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60"}
{"text":"Great place for family fun. I wouldn't take the family here to eat a meal because it adds up. The kids meals are a little pricey and does not include their drinks. The best day to come is on Wednesdays for their half priced games. Also, make sure to sign up for their emails. You will be sent deals that you spend $20 and receive $40 in game play."}
{"text":"I always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks .never had a problem with the food or drink.sometimes i will play games there sometimes.the girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy Brett is also nice.he works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there . even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink. Although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's has a rooftop patio? Who knew? I'll have to check it out the next time I am there.  I was there last night with friends. I ordered the trifecta something or another; skewers of shrimp, beef and chicken served over a bed of rice. Not bad.  I was pleased to find the machines have been upgraded. Now many of them are more like the interactive video games I enjoy. I liked the game that required me to swipe the screen with my hand, trying to slice the fruit with a sword. I also enjoyed the virtual jump roping and the motorcycle racing. I gave the masses of tickets I had won to random players. Maybe someday I will learn how to do the dance stomp successfully. Directions on all of the machines would be VERY helpful!  After D&B we walked next door to San Felipe's for some serious elbow dancing."}
{"text":"Having been to Dave & Buster's in California, I was pleased to see one nearby in Phoenix.  Our family enjoys the games and food offered at D&B's.

{"text":"Staffing has failed Sarah. There is literally more managers and then there are bartenders and while Sarah is doing an amazing job she has no help. Coming from someone in the service industry, it's a miracle that she hasn't left mid shift. The rating I have selected is based on your management and short staff. With all due respect, what are you paying your managers for? I will come back and See Sarah because she has been beyond apologetic when it is really not her fault. It is also not fair that she has to deal with the repercussions because she is one person and can't tend to everyone."}
{"text":"This place had its highs and lows.  Wait time, lineup,  and quality of food is on the low side. The games and free sports on TV is more of the benefit of coming here.  If you are coming here for a great meal, go somewhere else. If you are coming here for the games, and the meals are just an added extra, then this is the place for you.  It is rare to be able to find an arcade anymore, so this is one of the only placed you will be able to find one.  Good selection of games, but they can get boring after a few visits.   Making a great meal at home and playing xbox might be more entertaining."}
{"text":"Dave & Busters is always a fun place to go but their restaurant service could use some improvement. Weekends are extremely crowded so I was surprised that our food came out within a decent amount of time. However, my order came out completely wrong. Luckily the managers were nice and gave us a free game card for the trouble we experienced."}
{"text":"My husband and I (both in our late 20s) have been to D&B before for work parties and enjoyed ourselves in the arcade.  The food was never very good... but the entertainment is.  So when trying to figure out a good holiday gift for our 4 nieces & nephews under the age of 10 who live overseas (and thus, can't haul back big piles of presents), Dave & Busters was a go-to.  Definitely better than Chuck E Cheese.  We had recently gone from two incomes to one, so we were on a bit of a tight budget.  The last time we were there, $20 went really far for us- and our server also talked about getting $10 free coupons when signing up on-line.  So we opted to give each of the kids $15 power cards and used our free coupons.  The person they had at the register had to have an IQ of about 3.  Her name was Mariah or Sariah or something.  She had no clue what she was doing.  How can your total be SEVENTY dollars when you only wanted four $15 power cards?  15+15+15+15=60 in my world.  Then we also had the buy $10 get $10 free coupons for myself and my husband.  So we went in expecting to spend about $40.  We asked her for a breakdown of the charges, and she got really defensive when we questioned why our total was so much.  She then threatened to make us pay some sort of 'activation' charge for each of the cards.  What?  After arguing with her for 5-10 minutes with her not listening AT ALL to what we were saying- she simply kept telling us the same thing over and over... the kids started to run amok from the waiting, and seeing the line piling up behind us - we just paid it so we could move on.  We were hoping to speak with a manager about the over-charge before we left but the little ones were getting to be a bit fussy and we didn't want them to have to wait another 10 or 15 minutes while we sorted the whole thing out.  The reason some of them were fussy?  Because this genius cashier gave us two $15 cards and two $25 cards.  She added the extra $10 play on, instead of divvy-ing it up like we asked.  Try to explain to a 5 year old and 4 year old why their cards were uneven and why one of them got to play a lot more games.  Not fun.  I had hoped for a better experience.  Next time I guess we will just go back to Chuck E Cheeses, since at least we can see and control how many tokens everyone has.  Really, really disappointed at the poor service and communication from the people there."}
{"text":"It is a cool and fun place to be with friends or with your date.. D & B is really hhhhuggggee! Very nice bar area with so many booze to choose from..Tv's all over the place, pool area and never forget to play at the arcade-the most fun part!!  Went there for late dinner, they restaurant closes at midnight I think coz by 11pm, it's already dead! Servers are friendly but a bit slow to serve the food and doesn't provide you napkins and cutleries right away, and they won't even come unless you call them..The food??...SO-SO"}
{"text":"Not great.  That's what sums up my entire first experience at Dave and Busters in Vaughan.   I'd seen the commercials while staying with friends in America. The place looked loaded. People having so much fun they could barely contain themselves. But this wasn't what happened on my visit.  We arrived and decided that food was the first thing that needed to happen. The dining room is HUGE. It's a basketball court. Not literally, but it's the size of one. There's a sign by the hostess counter asking you to wait to be seated, so we wait. And wait. And wait. After about 10-15 minutes (for a largely empty dining hall) we are approached and asked if we have a reservation. We say we don't, so the server says she'll seat us right away. She seems friendly. We look over the menu and after another 10 minutes or so our server returns and asks us if we wanted drinks. We order drinks, and they take about 10 minutes, too. This seems to be a recurring theme. We then order the food.....which takes 20-25 minutes to arrive. It may have been 30 minutes. The food doesn't look anything like the pictures on the menu and is barely lukewarm. My pizza is bland with little to no sauce, my friends pasta is flavor-deprived, and the tater-tots are boring and have hardly any bacon or green onion on them. The only dish that was acceptable is the fish and chips, which is still only so-so as the chips are house made potato chips and are dry and plain. We ask for refills on the sodas which take another 10 minutes. The server is friendly enough, but if these things take this long to do you should give your guests fair warning. And soda should NEVER take 10-15 minutes to bring to the table or refill.  The games section is okay. A lot of games are broken and don't have any prizes attached to them. It feels like a challenge to use up all your funds on your card.  Went for a friends birthday and won't go back unless it's at the insistence of someone else"}
{"text":"Great place and location with an awful  staff and horrendous service. I expect D&B to be an electrifying fun place with a high energy, friendly staff, especially at its location in the Westgate entertainment district. I know this is a new location and maybe it was the pressure of a grand opening deadline that forced them to take anyone with a pulse to fill positions. We all hope the unqualified, non-customer service staff members are weeded out and replaced by quality, hardworking, friendly and honest individuals. JT was our waiter and he was terrible!! When you're in a profession that customarily rewards service with tips that reflect the level of quality, it's amazing that customer service is a problem. Many people are willing to pay for good service. A large part of the blame belongs to management. Lack of training, engagement and awareness of what's happening in their establishment is reflected on the staffs low-level performance. With the Westgate area build-up, service and hospitality will be the difference in the competition with the east valley."}
{"text":"My son loves this place. We always get great service. The games are  Always being switched out for new technology. We never get bored with all  Choices."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there for the happy hours- Sunday to Thursday 4-7 pm, you can get $10 per person for game play for 1 hour.   At first we got our card but the cards wasn't working. Turns out it's because they were not activated and we had to go back to the front desk to activate. Also there was many time where my card didn't work properly, I had to insert few times on every machine to get it working.   The limitation for this deal is that you can't play any games that spits out tickets, which is majority of the games thats there. It's only good for racing or shooting games so it gets boring real quick. Also all games runs for like 1 minute, the game ends so fast before you realize it.   I'd probably not go back, unless I was in the area and it happens to be a Wednesday.  P.s: Wednesday is half priced for game tokens."}
{"text":"I give the games a five and the restaurant a three so it evens out at a four. I went on a day there weren't any big games on as I assumed they would be busy. But still service was at best lacking. The drink took about ten minutes to make it to the table. The food another half hour. And all the while we saw the server maybe three times in the whole hour and a half we were at the table. Pretty frustrating. The games though were fun and the atmosphere of the place in general is good."}
{"text":"Honestly not even a one star.   I came in from out of town celebrating a friends pregnancy and have never been to a Dave and busters. We walked in and were politely sat and our waitress took our drinks.   20 mins later roughly we finally got our drinks. Mind you we were not even given water or anything at that matter. We knew what appetizers we wanted and we knew our dinner choices also.   We all ordered the TNT drink, after we finished our drink we were told that we could only have one drink per hour!! Ou of confusion we were like etc what are you talking about this is also a bar and if we had limited drinks we should if definitely been told before hand.   We got our food, the service was absolutely the worst and like any customer we sat there discussing over dinner how long it took and how awful it was too be out of specific key items that would've made our dinner much more enjoyable ( for example: I got chips and Queso with guac, I was almost always out of the queso and guac or the chips and had to constantly ask for more which in all matter took about 15 minutes. There was no one else in the restaurant).  We had multiple conversations with the manager about how it was taking forever for our food to arrive and also with our drinks. After about 20 Minutes of absolutely no service the manager comes back and asks us to leave for \"cursing at the waitress\"... we never cursed at the waitress and we're always very polite even when we're absolutely dissatisfied with he service that was provided.   The point of the matter is the waitress must of been on the other side of the booth listening about everything we were saying.. then complained to the manager about our judgements about her service, said we were cursing at her and treated her poorly. We got kicked out and they put 6 extra drinks on our tab and asked us to leave, we never got those drinks and actually had to semi cause a scene to have them removed. We ended settling our bill and leaving but the feelings towards Dave and busters management and service/waitresses is absolutely a -20 haha I've never had this bad of service in my life.   *side note... we were basically kicked out for what we were talking about in a \"private booth\" which means our waitress was on the other side just hanging out eves dropping. Get a job/ life."}
{"text":"My wife and I like to go to D&B because we signed up for the online mailer and get lots of coupons. We always have a good time.  Their happy hour specials are good, and half-price Wednesday is a great value (but take note: they don't take their coupons on Wednesdays)  I have fond memories of the arcade from when I was young, and now there is an arcade for grownups that serves beer!  There are still kids running about, but establishment policy is pretty strict about unattended minors, and there is an adults-only curfew at about 10pm I think."}
{"text":"An arcade for adults.  Sounds pretty appealing, huh?  Well, we thought so too when my sister wanted to go there for her birthday party on Saturday, February 11th.  Her boyfriend called to make reservations and they would not allow him to make reservations even if he offered to give them a credit card to hold some lanes for bowling.    Four of us arrived eager to check this place only to walk into a madhouse.  There were lines and clusters of people everywhere.  There was a massive wait for the restaurant.  Groups of kids and random people everywhere about the arcade.  My impression: ghetto redneck population for sure.  Disorganized \"lines\" around the counter to bowl and occasional shouting over the loud speaker which was muffled and was hardly understandable.  There were empty lanes in the bowling area, but no one actually using them.  The woman in front of us had been waiting for some time, but we waited patiently behind her only to be told there was a TWO to FOUR and a half hour wait!  Are you kidding me?!?    We still decided to put our names on the list, but questioned why there were empty lanes.  The man behind the counter told us that they were reserved by corportate with a credit card and they don't care whether there are people there are not because their credit card is still being charged.  I asked how we were supposed to know when it was our turn and he said he would announce it over the loud speaker.  I said that you couldn't understand the loud speaker and he replied, in a very smartass tone, \"well, we'll do our best!\" more or less conveying that \"we don't give a damn whether you hear us or not.\"  I told him that it doesn't matter if you do your best if the equipment is static and hard to hear over all the masses of people and we were really disappointed.  He just walked away while we stood there trying to figure out what to do next.  Next was, of course, finding somewhere else better to go to fast."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We came on a THURSDAY morning right at 11:00 but we're told to leave and wait until 11:30. They were doing construction in the bar area so the reason to ask us to leave was for our safety. Fast forward at 11:30, we came in like Suckers. Had to wait 2 hrs for our food. Was told by our sever that they were short staffed. I did not see the acting manager assisting this poor guy who was trying to deliver 11-12 families their drinks/food. I was not impressed with my food at all. One member of our group ordered an appetizer and it was never delivered. She walked out. Don't eat here. Just stick to the games and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The employees are rude and act as if they do not want customers. There was a 1hr wait time. Not accommodating at all. Bowl elsewhere. It's a shame because it's a really nice Dave and busters. Just poor management."}
{"text":"Yesterday, in Afghanistan the US dropped \"the mother of all bombs\" and after experiencing my first visit ever to Dave & Buster's, I can honestly say that the bomb made less noise than the loud, obnoxious, overbearing ear-piercing noise that was Dave & Buster's. While I knew in advance what the experience would become, I never thought I would ever enter a place that made me want to turn around and walk out quicker. Knowing also that it was not my demographic, I attended a corporate event that was held in a separate room that was far from sound-proof. The food that was served was unidentifiable. It was fried something, deeply battered and unrecognizable as edible. If you want to lose your hearing, taste buds and sanity, then Dave & Buster's is definitely for you."}
{"text":"This is a new location that just opened. The bathrooms weren't flushing and smelled. Our burger order didn't come with garnishments such as lettuce or tomatoes. Our server had his elbow on our table slouching down and leaning on our table while asking for our order, not professional.  The kids enjoyed playing the games. However the service here sucks. Very surprising being that it's located in Westgate- the heart of all entertainment!"}
{"text":"Ordered the banana split cocktail, which was basically equivalent to a $7 milkshake. I seriously think the bartender (with her sparkling personality...NOT) forgot to add the alcohol.  Atmosphere was very low class, felt like a trailer park convention.  Refused to give me the eat and play combo because it was Friday. Left and watched a movie at home."}
{"text":"I can't believe how friendly the STAFF was. It was nothing but an amazing experience. Everybody was so helpful and courteous in assisting us. I was so amazed at how we were treated. I want to thank DANIEL at the ticket stand for playing a few extra games with my son so he could win more tickets. I also want to thank Monika at the card stand helping me get more bang for my buck with all the different discounts offered. The happy hour drinks were unbelievable a $4.50 greygoose and the menu was full of a variety of foods. Our waiter was helpful and no matter how busy it was he didn't skip a beat. My son enjoyed his 12th Birthday there and we will 100% be back. Keep it up Staff"}
{"text":"Gosh, I want to like this place more than I did. Of course it beats Chuck E Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza, but the food is pricey and not great. The game room is pretty great, though, and while the servers are plenty nice, they are also quite slow. I have to give it three stars because my son said it deserves 5/5, and as a eight year old boy he is the target audience."}
{"text":"The fountain sodas are over $3.00. Dead serious! What a rip job!  It's a cute place for a get together but prices are very over-priced!  I took my daughter here for her birthday and when we were bowling we ordered two fountain drinks and it was 6 dollars and change for two sodas! Pissed me off!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately decided to take my boyfriend here for his 22nd birthday. We had never been to Dave and Busters and do not plan on going back. First we call ahead to make sure it's not going to be busy and to see if they do anything for birthdays, they told me it would be slow and they would do a dessert. Get there and it is nice and slow, they tell us to sit at the bar area all the way in the back past the arcade, get back there and can't find any kind of server but once we do they tell us to go sit in the lounge up front. They tell us our server will be with us soon, 10 or more minutes pass, no one at all, barely any tables but 5 or 6 servers are standing near by all chatting and just staring at us, two workers were evening cuddling and kissing each other! Our server greets us and I explain it's my boyfriends birthday, doesn't even say happy birthday just seems annoyed. Was grumpy the entire meal with us and I asked him twice for a dessert and then also asked who I figured was a manager for the dessert they had told us my boyfriend would get for his birthday. Finally after sitting forever after our meal wanting to be playing games not sitting, it finally comes. Then we go play games where multiple we're not working and were taking our money and then malfunction, went to the front to claim the free rewards I had in my email and the worker gave me attitude. Just all in all an overall crappy experience."}
{"text":"Peter Piper for grown-ups.   I knew we were in for an expensive evening here, but we wanted to do something \"interactive and fun\" (my friend's words) for a couples' date. For a grand total of about $175 for two, there were soooo many other things we could have done which would have included better-tasting food, better service, cheaper drinks, and better comedy. We had a great time with our friends, but we would have fun with them anywhere. At least the Super Trivia game paid off enough in tickets to bring home Fun Dip for my kids."}
{"text":"Well, we had an unexpectedly positive experience at Dave & Buster's today for lunch after setting the bar pretty low based on reviews here and what seems to be the \"scam\" of chain restaurants these days (high prices, poor service, mediocre food, you know the drill).  It looked to be yet another average to below average experience when nothing on the menu blew us away and then the long wait for the food.  Less than perfect experiences at any restaurants seems to be the norm so we've gotten used to settling in with our phones and trying to roll with the punches.  When our food did finally arrive, the waitress said something to the effect of our meals would be taken care of due to the long wait and perhaps that the items we ordered should have come quick -- we're unsure because the restaurant was quite loud.  Anyway, getting any reduction in the bill is always a nice thing to hear and we were actually impressed with our meals.  I ordered the turkey melt and wasn't expecting much but something in it (maybe the peppers) really brought it to life!  Hubby had the Thai salad which was a low-calorie item and was pleased.  We finished then prepared for the long wait for the check expecting we would owe at least the beverage I got with my entree or maybe we were only getting one entree comped.  The waitress eventually came by and told us our check was taken care of and we were free to go!!  We were shocked as nothing like this has ever happened.  We pulled out a $10 cash tip for her because her service was great and of course we were quite happy getting a free meal.  I'm only taking a star off because it was loud, but I also understand that is what Dave & Buster's \"is\" and the hostess wasn't very enthusiastic about helping us, seemingly to just want us to seat ourselves in the bar vs taking us to a table away from the chaos of the arcade.  Great job Dave & Buster's for caring about your customers.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so much fun! Although we don't really come here for the food, it doesn't taste all that great and it's expensive. We just come for the games and drinks! They have a great bar and they can literally make any drinks. Games are a blast! And they also have a very good collection of prizes in their shop too! They have lots of stuffed animals and all things for everyone. Great for a date!! Will come again!"}
{"text":"Below I will give you some great advice on why and when to come here.  This will not be a food or service review.  Why? Because it's an arcade.  Regardless of their availabality or eatability of their food, I will come here for two things only, give or take:  \"House of the Dead\" and \"Aliens\".  My friends and I have burned through $100 of gametime on the \"Aliens\" game.  I saw that movie when it was released in theaters in the 80s. It was my first sci-fi movie, the scariest movie I had ever seen, and it had the most incredible machine guns...but they were more than my feeble brain could comprehend.  it still can't wrap itself around these futuristic man-toys - but now I can hold one and shoot nasty, scary Aliens with them, too.  I feel just like Sigourney Weaver with fatigues.  But I digress...Come here with the intent of spending hours on the Arcade games.  Don't come here for the food, don't come here for the \"Eat and Play\" combo.  Yeah, it's $15.99, and it gets you an entree and a $10 game card, but your choices will be BAR FOOD. burger, sandwhiches, dips, wings, nachos, yada yada.  If you come here with the intention of gettin plowed with your friends, then sucking at the Arcade Games because you can't focus...here are the best times for doing so: Happy Hour: Mon-Fri, 1/2 price cocktails, beer and wine specials -  4:30-7p Late Nite Happy Hour: Sun-Thurs, same specials as happy hour  however, i personally can do both simultaenously. and quite well. so happy hour here is a no brainer, as it is also \"power hour!\"  If you are like me and can spend 2-3 hours here, easy, on one or two games, the following are for you: POWER HOUR: Mon-Fri 4:30-7:00, 60min. for $10 (cheap date? half off cocktails and $10 game play in one hour?) WEDNESDAY: 1/2 off all games  other games i will play on 1/2 off game days: feel like i am on jeopardy by playing the super awesome \"Super Trivia\" (oh yes, i believe there is room for four other competitors, and you win tickets) jump into the driver's seat of a nascar in \"Daytona USA\" sweat like a maniac in \"dance dance revolution\"  Finally, if you are a ticket game person and think you will walk out of there with a new stereo because you kick ass at SkiBall, think again.  Three of us played for three hours, had thousands of tickets, and walked out of there with a shotglass, some jelly bellies, and a fart machine.  Expect to spend hundreds, if not more - in order to get something half way decent."}
{"text":"Hosted a work party at Daves's and had a great experience. From the event manager to the server they made hosting the event fun and easy!  I had 15 people, food all came out at the same time and everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Matt and Heather were so helpful. They helped us get our points on a new card so we didn't have to drive 30 min back home. He explained everything and even talked us into eating to get more chips. We love dave and busters but this has been the best service ever! We also had a meal remade because somebody threw away our to go box . and at the rewards station they covered a portion of what we didn't have enough for to help with us get our prize we really wanted. They definitely got a 20 out of 10 for customer service tonight. I was so impressed with everyone we talked to. It feels good to be appreciated as a customer because its hard to come by these days."}
{"text":"I'm hoping this is a case of a new restaurant struggling to find a good staff. We were told it was a 20 min wait for a regular table but there were open tables in the bar. We stood by a table for about 10 mins before someone came by and cleared a table from lunch--this was at 4:30. Many servers were just hanging out having a chat behind the bar area--very visible. Our order took quite a while to come when it was finally taken. My wife said the first 3 stalls in the restroom were completely out of TP and it was filthy.  Food was fine once it came, but it took so long from entering to eating, we didn't want to stay and play games. I will go back eventually because I liked the one in Chicago, but it might not be for a while."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to visit when I'm in Phoenix!  I love the food, the service and the games. The prices are decent, nothing way overpriced. Unlike other video game places they keep all their games well maintained, only one game in the entire place was out of service. The jackpots are easy to get and they are not cheap with their tickets. I can't wait for this franchise to open in Utah!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this Establishment, other then please do not eat or get drinks here. If you want to come down to play games, then sure. However, the restaurant food is bad quality, over priced, and the service is abysmal. Staff took much to long bringing out everything, especially considering the service area was almost entirely empty. The waitresses herself was rude, looked as if she had recently consumed drugs, and had to ask her co workers about our basic questions in regards to the menu. Complained to the manager about the poor service, and was told that if we do not like it, we can leave. Ridiculous. Never eat food or get drinks here. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else in the waterfront. Rock Bottom is right across the street. Drink/Eat there then buy a game card if you must come here. Place sucks"}
{"text":"Have a beer, play some pacman, and eat cheese fries.  Sounds pretty grand to me, I really like hanging out with a group of guy friends here and just kicking it for a couple of hours.  You have to watch out for drunken game hogs that take over certain games for hours at a time, blowing dollar after dollar, while others sit and wait in line.  That is what happened the last time we were here.  My friend and I waited on a game for like twenty minutes before this middle aged drunk backed off, and I am pretty sure that he was about to pee himself.  Besides that, it is a great place for bdays and guy's night out."}
{"text":"Ive been to several Dave and Busters and this one is pretty good. The staff was very friendly, games and restaurant was clean and it wasn't over crowded. They had some fun game like candy crush, red cup challenge (beer pong), basketball and wheel of fortune. We through the kids about noon and it was age appropriate, it started filing up with the 20s crowd around 4 but we still had a blast!"}
{"text":"I have never been so bummed! My husband and I were really looking forward to a fun time after typical hours. We arrived at 11:00 pm on a Saturday night only to have the staff continually ignore us when we wanted a table. I understand that it is busy on a Saturday night, but we called ahead to make sure that it wasn't too late to get food. For a place that is open until 2 am...it is absurd to be shutting everything down at 11 pm and only cater to the people already seated. I brought it to the attention of the manager and she refused to do anything about it except refund the money we had already prepaid for the game room. Talk about frustrating!  Also, this happened on a different date, I thought I had pushed send for the review but it sat in limbo for a while. This happened April 23, 2016."}
{"text":"My family visited this Glendale location on October 26th for the first and the LAST time. The location had two staff members attending to three tables if you could even say that because the young waitress was the only one we saw actually working while the other waiter by the name of Jeff, tall guy, was too busy mingling with other workers to do anything else. We were there as a group for a child's birthday and we wanted to order some food so we attempted to waive \"Jeff\" down but he proceeded to ROLL HIS EYES, TURN AROUND AND WALK IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. The young woman finally came over and took our order. Unfortunately everyone, except my father, received their order. FIFTY-FIVE minutes later everyone finished eating and still my fathers food was missing. Once again we waved down the waitress and she told us it had to be remade because it had been left out and gotten cold since no staff member had delivered it to our table. This whole time Jeff looked to be having a great time playing around with his coworkers as he ignored our group.  After complaining to the manager, who as it turns out was one of the people too busy mingling with Jeff to do their job, they didn't charge my father for his food but they charged him for things like tokens and macaroni we didn't even order. Too frustrated to complain to a manager that can't \"manage\" his staff much less this location we paid and left. We will make sure to spread the bad word of the disrespect and lack of service Dave & Busters at Glendale offers."}
{"text":"I had the worst service experience recently with @DaveandBusters. We proceeded to call in to ask if the could take a party of 20. They mentioned they don't take reservations, but they will put us on a wait list (1 hour wait). We arrived there 45 minutes in and checked to see where we were in the wait. Turns out we were not even on the wait list. I spoke to a manager who proceeded to tell me that they don't take waits over the phone and said nothing else. Not sure if he was saying we were liars or just saying his staff don't know what they were doing. Either way he did not really even care as he gave me a blank stare. So we finally got on the wait list, and the hostess was telling us 10 minutes as a seated group had just received their dessert, and they would page is when the table is available. So everyone decided to go to the bar or the games area to kill a bit of time. We came back half an hour later and still no table. That group of guests were gone but the table was not cleaned, just like many of the other tables. There were large booths that were available and they were not seating us in. The wait was so long people in my group started to leave. I was irritated and was not interested in staying for more horrible service. Who knows? If we ordered food, might be an hour before we received it. Btw their restaurant was disgusting, tables not bussed and there was dirty dishes and garbage on the ledge of their hallway. (See picture on Yelp) I will never return to Dave and Busters for their food. They should just stick to games. Pretty much all they are good for. Jimstar out!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty amazing.  Great selection if you want to sample quick bites or eat a solid meal.  Drinks on happy hour are a fair price.  We had great service while it was busy and watching a playoff game.  Catch the Golden Knights games here as well."}
{"text":"Jasmine was our waiter for a party of 10 on 1/25/17 She took our cards to charge us. It took her a long time to return with our cards (so she can copy all of our credit card information). The next day while I am at work i get fraud alerts from the credit card i used at dave and busters stating i purchased $200+ worth of stuff at albertson and $160+ at home depot. She was the only one who handle my card out of my sight. I contacted the rest of my party to see if I was the only one who got my credit card information stolen and three others in my party are also victims of identity theft. Beware of this place of business. Do NOT use credit cards especially if your waitress is JASMINE. She will steal your information and shop at home depot. I called dave and busters on 1/29/17 to speak to a manager. I spoke to the service manager name jamie, she said she would notify the general manager and i will be getting a call on 1/30/17. Today is now the 31st and still no call back. I hope this isn't a dave and busters employee group activity, to steal peoples credit card information."}
{"text":"I usually come here only for the games after dining somewhere else.  I think the prices of the games are comparable with other large arcade centers; a bit more than an arcade, but you can put $20 on a card and have some fun at like 10-15 games, which isn't bad at all.   The games are switched out quite often with the newest and greatest options. I like that I can have a new experience every time!  The Midway was clean and there weren't empty glasses or trash on the tables. I only saw one car racing game out of order, and it was one of four, so it wasn't that big of a deal.   We didn't visit the prize redemption so I'm not sure what the prizes were all about, though I saw other people with candy and some shot glasses. I'm sure it's a mix of child's and adult items."}
{"text":"We took a very large group (22) of adults, tweens, and teens when we were in Pittsburgh for the kids' sports event.  I didn't take an extraordinarily long time to get us seated even though they don't do reservations or call-ahead.  They asked that we let them know when 75% of our party was there and, after that, it was maybe 20 minutes.  We (the grown-ups) had one drink at the bar while we waited.  The bartender was friendly, efficient, accurate and then gone -- pretty much what you want at a place like that.  The drinks were the right mixer/liquor ratio.  At dinner, the server (Kristine, I think) was friendly and attentive.  She got zero orders wrong and the food also came out in what I think was a reasonable time for the size of our group.  (The only mistake was one person never got the steak knife they asked for and ended up having to use a butter knife on his steak.)  As a server in my high school/college life, I can definitely attest that it's hard to get zero things wrong, from the server to the kitchen, with that large a group.  I'd qualify the food as \"pretty good\" and definitely better than one might expect at the grown-up version of Chuck E. Cheese.  I had salmon and it was cooked nearly perfectly (a hard feat to pull off).  And the salmon came with sauteed spinach which I love!  The gaming area was TONS of fun, of course.  The tokens-per-game cost was about what I would expect (high-ish).  Using the card instead of paper tickets is definitely the way to go.  The prize selection was huge but, of course, is right in line with what you'd expect...a ton of tickets for anything decent.  (My daughter's 800-ticket - I think - water bottle was dropped on the carpet the next day and busted, soaking the carpet and disappointing her.)  We go into any D&B expecting to spend about $50/person and to have a great time.  That's what we got."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was with a group of friends. It was pretty crowded which was normal considering it was a Saturday. What really threw me off was that most of our orders took about more than an hour to get to our table. One of my friends didn't get his until another 25 minutes after we were done eating. The second time I went to this place it was just me and my boyfriend on a Wednesday night,which was not that crowded. They gave us a buzzer and told us it would be 10 min to seat us, yet there was more than 15 tables open. She was just talking to a waitress and sat us when she was done talking. She sat us at a big round table which had 8 seats which was odd because there were booths open. Then nobody came to asks what drinks we wanted and there was just a lot of workers just messing around as if they didn't have a job. After 15 minutes we left."}
{"text":"Four words: Video Games And Beer!  I was broke that night so I was rocking a sucktastic Coor's Light in a mug the size of a small grain silo that cost me less than six bucks before tip.  The games are all run on these rechargable cards.  They have tons of video games, and of course skee ball and those silly basketball hoops.  Bring friends, get silly, and play some games.  You're not likely to meet a girl here unless she's working.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother the help unless you're just so fabulous that they cannot resist you.  In which case, you and I can be the two exceptions.  Or you could be daring and lure a girl here.  Come on, video games are almost cool now!  Ladies, if you're looking for an eligible geeky guy who's possibly socially challenged but likely trainable, this would be a prime spot.  When I was there it wasn't all that busy (Monday night) but the staff seemed friendly and eager to please.  There was a slight incident with an overly friendly guy who wanted to be our personal trainer on this game that resembles DDR but is too hard for words because of all the hopping skipping and jumping in different directions.  Anyways, I'm pretty certain by the lack of uniform that he was not working there, just trying to be friendly.  A little too friendly.  But back to the game itself.  Man it was hard!  But hey, if you don't mind looking retarded in public,  which I don't, -especially when playing video games - it's great cardio.  Play Time Crisis 4 at least once.  Tell them I made you.  Edit:  I hear what Max is saying.  There were no kids there when I was there.  I suggest you go later and drink more."}
{"text":"It saddens me to see so many bad reviews about this place because it's a cool place to hangout but obviously they have a customer service issue that needs to be fixed. I enjoy coming here with my friends and playing the games. They have all of the latest arcade titles and they are all in brand new condition. If you want to get more games for your buck, come on Wednesdays. The games are half priced so you get more play time for your money. One thing that kind of sucks is the parking on certain days. When there is a coyotes game or an even at the arena, forget about parking. We always have to park at the Tanger Outlets and walk all the way to D&B, otherwise you have to pay $15 to park on one of the lots. However, I enjoy this location more than the Tempe or Desert Ridge Marketplace locations."}
{"text":"Dave and Busters was insanely busy. We were told it'd be a 45 minute wait but it ended up being over an hour. When we checked back in with the hostess, she had an attitude and said \"I called you 4 minutes ago.\" We never received a text notification and they never called our name, as we were at the bar right beside the hostess stand for 50 minutes and then moved over at the hostess stand approximately 10 minutes before we spoke with her. Once we were seated, our waitress was very polite and the food was amazing. However, the floors were disgusting and covered with food and other debris, as was the bar top when we sat there. At one point, our waitress handed us a ketchup bottle that was covered in ranch dressing and mustard and didn't think twice about it! We had to ask another waitress to clean it up. Again, the food was great, but for the price we paid for a few drinks, an appetizer and two meals, I expected MUCH better service. We did enjoy the games and such, but it was too crowded as well. If we ever go back, we will avoid the dining room at all costs and eat back in the game room."}
{"text":"I give 5 Stars to the Banana's Foster dessert and 1 star to the loaded nachos.  The bananas foster has always been fresh and very very good.  The nachos on the other hand lack quality cheese and have had very small portions of beans to make them worth the 13.00 cost.  I will definitely buy the desert again and never buy the nachos again."}
{"text":"We went here today, to celebrate my granddaughter's 16th birthday! Even though her parents were there an hour before the party was to begin, the table wasn't ready until Almost an hour past the time the party was to start!      After we were seated, and the obviously inexperienced waitress took our orders, it took forever for the food to come out! Several of the orders were wrong, and one order didn't come out until everyone else was finished with their meals. The price of the food was HIGH! On a positive note, everyone said their food was very good, once it finally came out!    The atmosphere would probably be fun for tweens and teens, but for the rest of us, it was SO LOUD, I was actually afraid it would damage our hearing. To be fair, my grandchildren had a great time, and enjoyed all the games!    I hope this review is helpful!"}
{"text":"Went to Dave and busters to eat.... NO FOOD. Went to Dave and busters to play.. NO GAMES. Then I thought I'd wet my whistle with a cool glass of H2O..they even RAN OUT OF WATER... Some lady even yelled at me in line to purchase game tickets accusing me of cutting line. SUCH HOSTILITY. dave and busters? More like BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD. SMH"}
{"text":"They fucking suck  They cheat you out of tickets on technicalities say you have a certain cards and you need another type that you don't have.."}
{"text":"Sad, just sad.  Wait forever with sticky unclean tables.  Order messed up.  Then get dirty looks because they have to fix it.  Yes you with green hair.  Won't be eating here ever again because of you."}
{"text":"Game area and game area staff is good. Food area staff is horrible. Was told it was self seating and someone would be with us. A server came to our table twice and told us would be with us in A moment 15 mins later we left without as much as a drink served to us"}
{"text":"The food is great but the customer service was horrible , bad service , waiters and servers had attitude and didn't pay attention to guest"}
{"text":"A great place to bring big groups. Their food menu is pretty standard, very much like your typical Jack Astors or Moxies menu. However, they are a little pricier. The Midway is the best part, though, especially on Wednesday's with half price games. A lot of fun for a decent price!"}
{"text":"Cold fries every time we come here and I always order a side salad dressing on side and EVERY time they toss it. This time salad came out after dinner. I decided to complain about the fries so they took them back and came right back with a few warm fries on top. Server is in need of training. I find it ridiculous that a server is unable to answer questions about food on the menu. Eating prior to coming here is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"Great fun for me and my son. Good game variety. Food is mediocre at best and the service is poor. Waitress was clueless as to drink prices. And she also didn't think the fish and chips came with tartar sauce...really? It's supposedly a best seller."}
{"text":"Good: games are great if you like video and carnival type games  Bad: Food was not good  Recommendation: Eat somewhere else first and finish the night here!"}
{"text":"Tried calling ahead to reserve a table for 10 48 hours in advance, and I was laughed at and told they don't ever reserve tables. Rude place, needs to get with 2017 and reserve tables."}
{"text":"Stay away!! WAY too expensive. Poor quantity of food. Managers don't seem to care much. Yes... The game room seems cool w all the lights & sounds but seriously D&B, $14 to play Air Hockey?!   Sorry D&B... You'll never get back in my wallet!"}
{"text":"Great place for some fun. Especially on Wednesday, since they have half off games.   Actually never ate food here. Mostly because natural breaded foods that come with arcade restaurants  Never a dull moment. If there is inconveniences, I always am understanding"}
{"text":"WAY OVERPRICED!! Managers are rude. Bartenders on the other hand are very friendly!! But unfortunately I cannot recommend this place. It is dirty and Overpriced. The food is expensive and just so-so."}
{"text":"D&B is just a solid spot for fun. You can bring kids, a date, grandparents, your crazy aunt PatPat, and you'll have a blast. The alcohol is moderately priced, the prize shop is full of crap, but there's no cover fee, no lame dress code, and there's guaranteed fun. - Fun fact from our bartender. They order the UFC fights & show them in the conference room. There's no fee to get in, but once seated, there's a minimum $20 per table which is the best deal I've ever heard for fight night."}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us walked into Dave and Busters tonight for dinner and a little game play. I was happy to see that the dining room wasn't crowded with only one couple at a booth. We were greeted by an employee and in a less than charming voice she said, \"it's open seating.\" We proceeded to enter the dining room and there was no visible seating for groups larger than 4, so we started to move and pull tables together while the staff did nothing to help. After all, they must have been very busy with that one table full of two people!   The waitress came around and took our drink orders. I was thrilled  to have learned that happy hour was until 7:30. I ordered a half priced very berry mojito. The drinks came, I didn't quite care for my drink, it was very very sweet. Almost like drinking koolaid. I was still in the drinking mood and was up for trying another half priced drink before happy hour was over, but our drink glasses sat empty for a long time with no waitress in sight. Our waitress finally returns from the abyss, asks two people at our table if they would like refills, and ignores the remaining 6 people. Really?! I was thinking this surely must be one of those 'What Would You Do?\" shows, but unfortunately it wasn't and the lack luster service went on throughout the meal.   Speaking of our meal. We waited for what seemed to be an eternity for our food to arrive and when it did only half of us received our meals. The waitress got lost once again in the abyss during this time and drink glasses remained empty. Too bad because there would have been a lot more alcohol consumption.  I tried to be gracious and wait till my buddies got their food, but  I was starving by this point and dug in.    I got the jack daniels chicken/power card combo. I asked to have the green beans, but was informed that they no longer served the green beans. Last time I visited, I had the green beans and they were well seasoned with just the right amount of crunch, tonight I was served a few different pitiful looking pieces of broccoli and carrots. The chicken was two paper thin pieces. I'm not exaggerating, paper thin! The mash potatoes were like wall paper paste! And they messed up two of the steak orders at the table. They were served very well done when the order was for medium rare. Also, I overheard  my friend comment that his steak tasted like saw dust. There were various mistakes with the other orders as well...wrong sides, etc.   After the meal, we went to play the games. The games were fun and I thought of it as Dave and Buster's very clever way to have me forget about the gawd awful service and food I just endured. But all in all it wasn't fun enough to make me forget to post on yelp and warn my fellow yelpers! Eat somewhere else and visit here to  play the games after! You have been warned!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross!   Our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.     The manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free."}
{"text":"I'm being a little harsh here, but honestly this is up for grabs as far as stars goes. Here's the break down...  Service- 4/5- I say this because it was a busy Saturday night and our waiter was slammed in the bar area, but still made sure we were somewhat taken care of. I came with one other, so our ticket wasn't going to be too high, so I can understand paying attention to bigger tables.  Games 4/5- the games were decent, most worked as supposed to. The only bummer was for the DDR game, two guys played it for a hour straight. They were sweating profusely all over the game, and set up a water station with them. They didn't rotate out for others to play, little annoying.  Food 2/5- Ok, as a chef I get it, it's a busy Saturday night, tables are packed. That's no excuse though for cold pizza bites, Luke warm chicken tenders. I understand most of the food is microwaved or thrown under a salamander to brown. But for it to come out cold like that is inexcusable. I was really upset to spend 30 bucks for cold food.   Overall- avoid high periods of activity. You'll get cold food, sweaty people taking over games."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend. Drank beer and played videos games, didn't actually have any food. It was a lot of fun.   The reason for the 3 stars: Set my beer and coat down on the bar, asked the bartenders if we could set this stuff here, they said yes, and then bussed my beer. There was about a third of a glass left. Okay, no big deal maybe they were confused. I get another beer, a bit later I go to cash out, set my beer down to settle my tab, and the bar tender busses my beer again! Granted there was only a couple of sips left but come on."}
{"text":"Not really sure why it would take ten minutes to get a waitress to come to your table to get drunk orders, but it did. Five minutes later we get the wrong drinks so she turns around and we wait. Five more minutes and someone else asks us whether we've been waited on and we tell them what has happened they apologize and leave to check on our drinks. Ten minutes later, yes a full half hour after being seated we are asked again if we've been helped. We decided to leave. On our way out we get berated for leaving. This is the type of place that just needs to get rid of food and just do games."}
{"text":"Main dinning room is dated and feels dirty..  the food :  appetizer cheesey dip looks to be tostinos dip you can buy at the store and heated up.. we had stale chips to go along with it..  the kids meals looked to be frozen and heated up in the microwave.. My turkey melt was just unpleasant .. no other words for that...  wife said her salad was ok..  my draft Dort beer came to me semi flat and expensive..  wife enjoyed her margaritas..  best part of the meal were the fries... but trust me.. thats not saying much...  just completely over priced..   Server was very nice though.... Actually gaming room was fine .. but of course you blow through the cash quickly..   Bathrooms smelled like Old muni stadium..  Overall I couldn't wait to get the hell out of this place..  I'm going to do everything in my power not to go back there again... but of course the kids enjoyed it because they were able to purchase and win some cheap stuffed animals.. :("}
{"text":"I usually come here because I get the email for a free $20 extra of game play when I purchase $20 is game play, so really I am getting $40 worth!   It isn't too packed whenever I visit, but I tend to avoid peak hours. Drinks in here are a little expensive but they're good. Good luck waving down a bartender when it's busy. It is harder than some of these video games!  The food is alright, but who really goes to Dave and Busters to eat? Well, this is Yelp which relates to food so unfortunately I have to factor that into my star count....  Games are a blast. I wish there was more selection. They let you bring the drinks to the games as well. Make sure you sign up for their email list. Yes, you will get annoying emails, but it's great value if you actually want to come here and play some games because it's basically $40 for $20! 2 for 1! Sweet deal"}
{"text":"Just like the one back in my hometown of Cleveland.  Their \"prize\" room was emptied out though.  A little disappointed in that though."}
{"text":"The games are fun, it is expensive to take a family of 4 but the kids like the games.  Years ago, the food was top notch and chef quality.  The past few times we have gone the food has become a lot like getting a meal at TGI Fridays and sometimes Dennys'.  Our recent dining experience was not great.  One manager came over almost immediately after we received our food, and asked how things were, we told him fine.  Another manager came over after we were eating about 15 minutes and asked again, things were fine.  I have slow eaters that discovered their ribs tasted burnt, the noodles were slimy and they did not eat them.  The waitress brought the check and asked us why we didn't want boxes, so I felt I should be honest and tell her the kids did not like the meal, tasted bad.  She had the manager come over again and he said, \"why didn't you say something, this is why I asked you\".  I was a bit taken aback and  said, well, to be honest when you came over, they hadn't even got to those areas on their plates...\"  I was quite offended by this and from now on we can play games at D&B but skip the meals...if your going to pay 18.00 for a plate of chicken wings/ribs and fries....just go have a nice meal at a better restaurant and get better quality for your money."}
{"text":"My Army buddies and I would frequent D&B Waikiki while stationed on Oahu. I was nostalgic for the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, so I decided to take my kids to the new Summerlin location last night. From the get go, the whole staff was chipper and bubbly, even under so much noise and so many people! We got to our table and Bill was our server, he's from back home in SoCal, so right away we clicked with him. I was disappointed to see that my favorite pasta was no longer on the menu. To my surprise the Chefs went above and beyond and made my dish. Thank you for a wonderful evening! My kids even remembered Bill's name, he was very nice to them, that goes a long way with me!!! Being in this industry and always going that extra mile for my guests, it was a wonderful experience and a great gesture by the staff to make a special entree just for me. We've already planned our next visit."}
{"text":"This arcade was so big!!! The vibe is super fun. There are machines everywhere to re load your card. You do have to wait in a initial line to get your card. The bar is also big so there is no worry about having to wait forever or fight a huge crowd for a drink. I'll have to come back and try the food! A fun place for all ages"}
{"text":"After playing through the game selection at Sports Connection in Ballantyne, my man and I thought Dave and Buster's would give us our arcade fix. We were sorely disappointed.   To start, the place is huge. Acres of games and dining. The gaming selection is extensive, and arranged in a way that's reminiscent of casino games.   The problem is that many of the games are out of order in one way or another. One of the Super Shot basketball games had no basketballs in it -- which we only discovered after swiping our card -- and none of the hoops moved, even though the game still asks you to select whether or not the hoop pushes back as you play. There's only one air hockey table -- for four players? -- and it was out of order. Several other games flashed red across the floor, with no attendants servicing them.   Just as bad as non-functioning games are those that don't accept your card on the first, second, or third swipes. This may not be a big deal for Skee-Ball, but when you're playing a game like Jurassic Park or Deadstorm Pirates, you can run out of time to continue the game if the card isn't accepted. I'm already stressed about the T-Rex chasing my Jeep; I don't need the additional anxiety of not having my credits read correctly.   Oh, and the gaming credit system is confusing AF. You load your card with the amount you'd like to spend, but the value per credit increases based on how many you purchase at one time. Each game tells you how many credits it costs, but there's no simple way to determine how much you're actually spending per play.  The dining menu is lengthy but uninspired. Just because I want to play Whack-a-Mole, that doesn't mean I'm satisfied with chicken fingers or a \"pizzadilla.\" And I shouldn't be surprised by this, but the GF offering is nearly nonexistent.   The only thing keeping my review from being one star is that Dave and Buster's does seem to have a handful of games not found elsewhere in Charlotte. That's likely not enough to keep me coming back, however.   In short, there's a considerable amount of room for improvement. We'll get our Galaga fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fun place, decent food. Expensive for what you get.  Best value is half priced Wednesdays or eat & play combos."}
{"text":"At heart we may be adults but when one steps I to an establishment like this we are all kids again. My twins decided this is where we wanted to eat when I let them select the place. Bravo twin powers win again! We opted to buy two $50 game play cards since it seemed the best value. The cashier ended up giving us 2 bonus $20 cards for spending over $100, not a bad deal. We signed up at the kiosk registering the cards and for that we will get a coupon for a free $10 card when one spends $10.   The staff was very friendly and helpful guiding the store and how much each card gets with questions we asked. The game floor is amazing and I believe that we lost time in here since when we came in it was light outside then dark when we departed. We enjoy playing the games with tickets since then one can redeem for prizes.   We did not eat here, but there is a bar. I ordered a vodka tonic and it was ok, but people do not come here for the drinks. If one does want to get drunk here drink beer instead. When redeemed our tickets there is a store area where patrons feed them to a machine or one can have the cashiers add them manually. The prizes here are so cool and attainable too. The twins walked away with a bag full of fun and joy, mission of fun and being young accomplished."}
{"text":"Yep I'm giving Dave & Buster's a five star rating because they deserve it!! I had my daughter's birthday party here and I have to say it was the best birthday party we've ever had (yep I said it).  Charles and Selena were exception hosts and my daughter, her friends and my friends gad a fantastic time!! I would most definitely recommend hiring D&B for your next party!"}
{"text":"Terrible staff and food did not impress. The hostess told us we could sit in the bar area. After waiting 10 min. in the bar without any wait staff addressing us, we asked the hostess if we were sitting in the right area. She said we were fine there, but did not apologize for the neglect nor did she notify a wait staff of our unattended table. After another ten minutes, we returned to the hostess stand and said we would sit in the dining area since we still had not been served. Again, no apology, but seated us in the dining area. Our waitress was nice enough, but our food arrived before our drinks from the bar. The was nothing to write home about.  Game floor was clean. TONS of staff members around, but only one greeted us the entire time we played games. Gal at ticket exchange counter was on her phone and took a few minutes to notice we were waiting in line."}
{"text":"This place could be good but the service was by far some of the worst I have ever received. Our server Samuel was the furthest thing from attentive. We had empty glasses sitting on our table for 10 minutes before he came around to ask if we wanted refills. Then when asking about the food he flat out told us it wasn't good, and that we should only order certain things and then proceeded to name about 3 things that he said were good. Being a server I'm all for suggestions but don't tell a table that the food here is terrible. We knew what to expect when choosing to go to Dave and busters. We order the crispy potato cakes which were actually however we had to ask him multiple times so but the time he brought them to us the food was still barely warm. I understand when a server is busy that they may not be able to get you everything you need as quick as you would ideally like it but when I see you standing around chit chatting with co workers instead of getting things we asked for that's when I get upset. Needless to say our server made our experience terrible."}

{"text":"Finally got to go to Dave & Buster's for the first time over the holidays as part of my company's holiday celebration.  We were a group of 20-something people and they had set up a lunch buffet for us downstairs with a few choices. The tables were also set up nicely and everyone had a great time. Food was ok, chicken breast and some pasta type dish, bread rolls, butter, salad. All in all a little bland, nothing too exciting.  After lunch we headed upstairs where they have all the fun games. There are a couple of bar areas, I saw one downstairs and one upstairs.  The games are great, they probably have anything you can think of, from earthquake simulators to fruit ninja.  At the end I ordered wings to go for my husband, which took a while to show up, but hubby liked them so it was worth the wait I guess."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to feel like a kid again. Very young crowd. Fun games and average food."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's usually doesn't need an introduction because they're found all over.  But it's new here and some type of brief introduction is needed.  Best way to describe a Dave & Buster's....it's a Chuck E' Cheese for kids and adults.  I don't have little one anymore.  She's now an adult.  But when she was a child, she loved Dave & Busters.  Her competitive juices would flow, she would play games just for the tickets, and later hit up the gift shop.  I was that proud dad that would spend over $50 on games to win a $10 toy.  Yup, as long as my princess was happy, I was happy.   Times have change and I no longer find D&B as fun as it used to be. It's loud and this location's no different. This location is the smallest D&B that I have ever been to.  The games are newer and cost a grip to play.  Is it me or are the games that win tickets just getting harder and harder to win at?  As for the food, I haven't tried a lot here. The only items that I tried was their burger, the sliders, the fries, the ribs, the salmon, the wings, the chicken breast, the tenders, the onion rings, the onion strings, the pretzel dogs, the nachos, the pizza, and tots.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  I also had their calamari, the quesadilla, spinach dip, cheese sticks, NY steak, BBQ chicken, and mac & cheese.  Other than that, I really haven't tried much of their food.  The only item that really stands out is their ribs and BBQ chicken.  Now, those are pretty damn good.   I have also been here for a meeting.  Having a meeting here is pretty cool. D&B set us up in a private room with a few lunch options from the menu.  After the meeting, a D&B employee set us up on a scavenger hunt.  This was fun and I highly recommend.  D&B gave prizes and swag to the winners.  And by the way, my team won.    The last time I was here was with my girlfriend, our friend, and our friend's son. My girlfriend and friend played the giant sized Pac-Man, while I spent time with our friend's son playing video games.  He loved all the games, PR'd a few of them, and had a smile from ear to ear.  That's enough to put a smile on face too.  If he's a fan, then I'm a fan.  4 Stars!!!   2017 Yelp Review #22"}
{"text":"Went here for food. The food was disgusting. Over price and bland and tasteless. Also all the silverware we got was dirty."}
{"text":"Don't have another Dave and busters to compare it to. But it's a good start from all the hype I hear from this place. Bar is a little crowded. But the games are great! Absolutely worth your $$. We had a birthday party here and everyone was able to jump on their games without too much of a wait on a Saturday. Lots of fun can't wait to go back and use the rockem sockem robots. It was out of order when we went on Saturday."}
{"text":"Tonight 6 of my friends and I came here. We do often. We sat on the roof top for the first time. We had Megan as a server. We were very disappointed orders were not put in we spent about an extra hour and a half waiting for our friends to get and eat there food although we were all done.  An awesome server \"Will\" and manager \"Omar\" took care of us for the remainder and made our visit as good as it could be at that point! We are very appreciative to them."}
{"text":"What's the point of telling them your name when people that came after you get seated before you?! Then they going to ask \"are you waiting for something?\" Yeah to be seated!"}
{"text":"There were nine adults and four children and the waitress did an excellent job Fry's are fantastic the ribs were really good to sliders fantastic we wanted them without cheese they brought him out without cheese they substituted some of the things like fries for another item on the list fantastic place to go"}
{"text":"Fun place and the food is decent.  However, the service and friendliness of the staff on our last visit was a bit lacking.  My chief complaint is that the rewards program sign-up and getting your initial purchase added to the rewards account is not as simple as just making a purchase and giving them your info.  Instead, it's a major runaround that nobody at D&B seemed to have a handle on."}
{"text":"There is a counter as soon as you walk in where guests can purchase their game cards. We asked the cashier if there were any specials and the cashier was rude and only focused on the game cards. So we purchased three $29 cards for our kids and let them go. As we met our baseball team at the table, our friends told us about the food/ game card combo (includes unlimited games and a meal for $4 leas than what we paid per card for just 170 credits worth of games). Long story shortened, Jillian the manager refunded our original cards even tho our kids spent some of the credits, and then set us up with with 3 of the game/ food combos. She was very professional and apologetic that the original cashier was rude and did not offer the combo even tho we had asked. What started off as a 2 star review ended with a 5. A great deal for $26 to get a meal and unlimited play after first 120 credits are depleted. The second cashier we spoke with was very helpful as well. Thanks again Jillian!"}
{"text":"I've never been to one so I went in for my birthday. The price of the games are normal for larger arcades but the selection is a bit odd. I understand that it's originally geared towards adults but having a TON of casino-style machines (where you play chance with tokens or for tickets without any real skill involved) and only about 30-40% playable games is annoying. If I wanted to play games for coin, I'd go to an actual casino. They had some games that were free (limited time, I'm sure) and a few of the classics but overall, the choices are rather limited.   After a bit of game, we decided to eat here as well. Got The Boss Chicken Club ( grilled chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, creamy garlic-herb cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado/mayo spread and fried onions on a toasted whole-wheat bun) with fries which was really good. Also, they have Angry Orchard (the best domestic hard cider I've tried) on tap (with two different oz. sizes) which is definitely worth some bonus points in my book.  Also, the guy gave us a free brownie with a candle for my birthday without making a big deal about it which was awesome.   A major thing thing that annoyed me what the distribution of staff. I hope a game doesn't break on you because it's practically impossible to find someone to help. The photobooth ate our photos so I went up to the front counter to ask for someone with keys to open it up. There was a short line but the guy didn't even acknowledge me - a simple \"Just a moment.\" would have been more than appreciated instead of just ignoring my existence. What I assume was the manager finally looked away from the TV controller after about 5 -10 minutes of me standing there to ask if I needed something. They need more people operating the floor instead of the staff being mostly wait staff in the food area. There was also a missing puck in the air hockey game but since there was no one around to help, we couldn't be bothered again and shrugged it off as a loss.  Overall, come for a nice dinner if you don't mind the noise and want to play some games - but if you're here for the arcade, definitely go to Gameworks or (for the pinball aficionados like myself) Castles and Coasters instead. Way better selections there.  3 stars for good food quality and fair prices but with poor game selection and service."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and played games. I had the chicken, my son had steak, we also had a nacho appetizer. We have no complaints regarding the food or waitress. We are seated quickly, our waitress was attentive and everything was served in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that we didn't visit to play in the arcade, watch a sporting event, or pick up anyone...it was just 3 friends out for a dinner. We opted for the dining room....it was well laid out and comfortable, despite having wooden chairs for seating. The staff were amazingly good...friendly, engaging and checked on us frequently. I had the Mac n Cheese.......it was pasta tossed in a cheese sauce with panko breadcrumbs,  chunks of chicken and Applewood bacon. Now in my books, bacon makes everything delish....and it was. I thought it crass to lift the bowl and lick every last trace of the meal, so I left a few token bits of cheese in the bowl...however if the waitress hadn't stopped by, I may have tried to get those morsels as well. A friend had the Tater Tots covered in cheese and a spicy sauce. It was so much food she couldn't finish it all but she enjoyed it. 3rd friend had a pasts dish with chicken. She said it was good but she added her own scotch bonnet (that she carries with her) to the dish to give it an edge. She enjoyed it. All in all, a great meal that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Next time, I'll try the arcade."}
{"text":"I was actually really disappointed. I grew up going to D&B in Texas when I'd visit my family there and absolutely loved the place, but the locale at Tempe Marketplace would kind of a let down. I definitely wouldn't grade their food an A, it was decent but I mean it's 'playground' for kids and big kids alike I suppose, so you're not necessarily going for the food.  But the cleanliness was horrible. I walked into the womans bathroom and almost every stall was clogged/or cluttered as if it had been TP'd by a bunch of children.  Our waiter was a great help and super nice, but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was, \"Don't worry about it we have someone on it\" . I was seriously a bit taken back at his response and it rubbed me the wrong way. Don't think I'll be making another trip back, anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch today with my wife and 2 kids. Server was prompt getting to the table, took our order and then disappeared. Our food took 25 minutes yet there was only 4 table with people who were dining. Grilled cheese, salad and a quesadilla shouldn't take that long. Games were fine. Mens room didn't have any paper towels to dry hands with. Huge fail for this type of venue."}
{"text":"Games- great. Game prices- decent. Food- Edible, but nothing to write home about. Food prices- WAY too high for the quality. Bar- Weird. The 1st bar Ive heard of that doesnt carry Baileys or some type of Irish cream liqueur. Drinks- Meh, stick w/ beer. Service- Also weird. Ive had the best service here when its crazy busy and the absolute worst when my friends and I are the only people to be waited on.  A good time, if youre going for games and basic drinks."}
{"text":"I love the concept. But this location is absolutely filthy. Went on a Saturday night and felt like I was at a nightclub in Mexico. Crates and crates of dirty dishes everwhere, glasses, food, trash. I almost didn't want to drink... Almost. I had a couple that were very good but pricey. One of the bartenders was very rude. I did not want food I was too grossed out by the filth. The tables weren't cleared after people left, they just left the plates there to smell. I do not recommend allowing your teens or children here without supervision. It is very easy for them to access alcohol.  The restrooms were a disaster! Bloody pads on the floor, soiled toilet paper, half the stalls were clogged and the doors didn't work. I hope this was an off night because I can see myself going back, just not to this location. Should mention that this was upstairs."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night to have an hour of family fun but we were immediately greeted and serviced by Meka. She was so rude to the customer in front of us and to us that I had to ask to speak to the manager. I told him she should not be working the front counter because of her awful attitude and that I was concerned her eyes were going to fall out of her head because she was rolling them back the entire time she was helping the customers. When we left she was still at the counter.  Clearly the manager DOES NOT care about customer service because a woman with that much attitude needed to go home for the day not continue servicing customers who are walking into have a good time. The manager also mentioned this was a reoccurring problem and that I wasn't the first to complain about her. Shame on the manager for ruining paying customer's evenings!!!  For the first time games weren't working and they didn't have enough service employees on the floor.  Hope this isn't how it's going to be from now because we love coming to play the games.  We WILL NOT be coming back if we're going to be treated like garbage because the manager can't train his team members!"}
{"text":"Went out with some friends for a \"Girls Night\" a few weeks ago and had a blast. I would definitely recommend this location to my friends."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party here (which they don't take reservations for) and we came in early trying to get a table together. Both the manager and hostess were rude and said they never received a phone call for  the party after the manager proceeded to tell me they don't do reservations ??? He said he needed to know the EXACT number when I gave him an estimate and said it would take them a while to get everything together for us. Mind you half of the place was empty... they seated us but did not put any tables together so me and my friend both being servers took it upon our selves and put them together.. our server was amazing but the managers and everyone else were beyond rude. We then went to the bar, sat down for at least 10 minutes and 3 bartenders walked past us, did not greet us or even acknowledged us until I waved my hand and someone rudely said they would be right w us. Some lady bartender came over, stood in front of us and stared at us and said \"what can i get you\" we ordered our drinks, she asked for IDs which mine was in my purse on the other side of the restaurant so I said I'll be right back and my friend said that she'll take her drink and once again very rudely she said I'll wait until she gets back and make them together. After I get back w my ID they greet about 3 other couples after us and make their drinks before ours are even made. So probably about 20-25 min we finally get our TWO margaritas. So then we decide to eat dinner here. 2 kids 2 adults. We seat ourselves bc nobody was around and we didn't get a server until about 10 min, we ordered drinks and a gummy drink for the 5 year old bday boy... had to ask twice for her to get his drink... our food comes out (i order a medium steak salad, it comes out extra well, so tough i couldn't even cut into it) i tell another server but tell them to just make it medium rare bc i don't feel like waiting another 30-40 min and btw still no drink so we asked again.... we finish the food and the birthday boy was almost in tears because he really wanted this gummy bear drink so of course we ask a forth time and finally after an hour we get the drink.. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. inside is nice and really has potential but they need to hire real servers and bartenders. Also no manager in site the whole time this was going on, not even a walk by or nothing. Took us forever to get the bill and when she brings the bill we are still charged for the gummy drink that arrived AFTER we were done eating. We called a manager over and they ended up taking it off the bill. Probably won't ever eat/drink here again which is sad bc I live right down the street. They need to get their management together as well!! Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Thursday night, no children and not many people here. There was only one bar open, it was the middle bar. The waiter sucked, he sat a punched numbers in screen while we waited for drinks. It seemed like he was on drugs. It's 2017, and most bar tenders are junkies! Then went to the bathroom and it was filthy. I'll go else where next time. Not work it! This place has gone down hill hence the reviews. I'll stay in south end where customer service and staying clean is of importance."}
{"text":"We did not eat here, we merely played video games.  The games are decent, but kind of expensive. There was a line at several of the more interesting and popular games, and im not a fan of lines. It was noisy, a little overcrowded, and had lots of kiddos running around which isnt great if you are carrying a beer.  Overall a fun date night, but we wont be back on a weekend night due to the overcrowding."}
{"text":"This concept obviously has great potential and works- food, drinks, games, TVs. It should be a guaranteed win. However, the Concord location falls short. We brought in a large party (16 people) on a Wednesday, for a birthday. The service was horrible, inattentive, slow, and you could tell he'd rather be doing anything but waiting on us. The silly thing is, we were all there to spend money. The time between drinks was way too long (it shouldn't take 10 mins to get another beer, refills on sodas and waters should happen without asking). People in my party were \"skipped\" over and sat empty handed. When the food arrived, it was okay...burger was lukewarm, but I wasn't about to say anything because I was hungry. The kids' food arrived in waves, which left two kids eating while the other three watched. Kids should always be the priority...keep them busy and fed. By the time our dining experience was finished, we were quite irritated as our server, instead of cashing us out, asked one of our party attendees for a cigarette.  The games were fun, lots of variety, lots of chances to win tickets for underwhelming prizes. But, it was family fun. I'd come again with people, but would eat before hand and order my drinks from the bar as I played games."}
{"text":"I've been to several Dave n Busters in various places/states.  This one was the best.  The food was AMAZING.  The atmosphere was great.  Games were fun."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better rating. But I won't for a few reasons. Some of them are similar to other people's experiences with this place.   Positives- I really loved the TV's in the restaurant area and even in the Midway! It was nice to be able to watch the game no matter where we were in the building.  The games were also pretty diverse and fun. They have a decent variety of prizes at a fair rate for tickets, in my opinion.  The bartender was awesome in the midway and seemed like he knew his stuff. Great drinks! I love the strawberry watermelon marg. Didn't have to wait long to be served.   Negatives- Not entirely sure why I felt this way but this place gave me a \"sh*t show\" kind of vibe.  I came with a group of work people for a work outing and we wanted to use these coupons that were BOGO on game play. Well the manager couldn't find our coupon code in his system and at first didn't want to honor the discount despite the fact that their exact address and a valid date was on the coupon. It wasn't a fake manufactured one and I'm not sure how I would even do that on an app on my phone? He was stubborn to help us at first so it kind of started us off with a negative impression of the place. In the restaurant, the server was struggling to keep up with her tables and gave me the impression she was on her own for the whole restaurant. But it was a very dead Sunday night so I really don't know what was going on for the serving staff. It didn't really make sense. It took forever for us to get greeted and to place our order. The food was subpar. I have a little bit of a sour stomach now writing this a few hours later. Maybe too much grease?  I found that a few of the games on more than one occasion took more credit from my game play card than it should have. The game would glitch and say I didn't pay and I had to keep inputting the card but it wouldn't work. So then I would click 'play again' for it to finally work but it would take more credit off of my game play card :( also felt like some of the games were rigged to make you lose (call me a conspiracy theorist)  Lastly...You guys seriously have to get it together with the restrooms. They were absolutely gross. Very unclean in the women's restroom.   I wouldn't go out of my way to ever come back to this location. I live all the way in the North Canton/Akron area so it's definitely a hike getting here. Not worth it to me. I'll wait for the North Canton location to open before I would ever go to this one again. Not very impressed with the staff. Except for the awesome bartender in the Midway!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today and it was a great experience!  I took my daughter to a birthday party, and I was very impressed with how well everything was handled.  She has a food allergy, and the manager provided me with an allergy friendly menu, and personally made sure her order was taken care of.  While the kids were eating, the manager also came to check to see how everyone was doing. The waitstaff assigned to the party could not have been more pleasant and helpful as well.  The food was delicious, and the amount of food the kids got was great.  Each child at the party received pre-loaded cards, and they loved running from game to game.  While my daughter was playing a game, an employee came over and handled her 100 tickets, and told her to have a great day.   Each employee we encountered was equally friendly.  It was a great first experience and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Lesson from this review: Terrible management on the game floor! 1 star cause I'm forced to give a star and the restaurant earned it. Why -4 stars?? I ALMOST twisted my ankle while playing a game because it was built badly. I told the manager to fix it and to prevent any more injuries, NICELY. The manager of amusement, Jose, said he can't fix the Pump It Up Prime machine because it is \"standard\" and built by \"professionals\". The ones in California are completely different and are SAFE to play on. My group of friends and I suggested to raise it so it is safer and giving the game a longer life span, instead of having people break it within a few months due to constant stomping cause it's too low. The manager refused to fix it and threaten us that he may remove the game and we could ruin it for all other players. He said EXACT \"If they don't want to play, other people can play, we don't need their money\" right in front of us. Well since they don't need MY money, maybe they will be okay without YOUR money too. I REALLY wanted to like Dave & Busters because it's closer to my place and because I love arcades. Maybe this is a sign to stick to Gameworks or Round 1 in Industry City to play video games. It was their first day opening to the public. The fact that management is willing to treat their customers with such little respect, shows they do not care about the company or customers who come in. Please avoid this, or go.. Since I already spoke to a manager and they are not willing to fix it, you can sue because the manager won't do anything about it even AFTER the issue was addressed.  The bar and restaurant were great though!! The waiter, Samuel, was attentive and got everything we needed. We had two managers check up on us and made sure everything was spectacular. *sigh* if only the game floor had the same customer service skills then this review would be a 5 Star. Since Dave & Busters isn't a go to play to eat, I wouldn't come back. Don't lean on the machines or they get mad and you must be over 18 to enter or be accompanied by someone over 25 AT ALL TIMES. No outside food or drinks even though it's not posted (not posted means they LEGALLY can't ban outside food/drinks), outside drinks including water bottles like arrowhead and Dasani. Guess they want you to get their FREE tap water?? I already spent $100 and I regret it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to Dave & busters with a group of friends but when we got there it was super crowded and a lot of kids which was not any of our expectations at all. I thought this place was only for adults which is what we were looking forward to. I think Dave and busters should be adults only."}
{"text":"Three games weren't working, left side of Walking Dead wouldn't fire half the time, four player air hockey took our puck left our time rolling had to walk away, a third took credits never started. Smaller game area to me than others. Nashville size so much bigger and separate eating always open. No bowling. Didn't check out the pool tables. Good decent. BBQ pork had more fried onions than pork though come on."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us visited this location last night and had a less than pleasant experience. We began by playing and ordering drinks at the bar. They called in a manager to verify my id and he was very rude to the rest of our group when they tried to hand him their ids. We then went into the restaurant to eat in a more quiet area. We waited over 20 minutes before the hostess came to our table and said \"I'm sorry I'm not a server I really don't know what I'm doing but can I please get you something to drink?\" Our food came out and the man who delivered it took two plates off of one side of the tray and the weight of the other half caused the tray to fall on the floor. His response was \"surprisingly that's only the fourth time that's happened to me.\" FOUR? Once is an accident and a lesson. He then had my salad \"remade\" which was supposed to be a Caesar kale chicken salad with tomatoes, Parmesan and cilantro. It came out with ice berg lettuce, literally four pieces of chicken that were cold, and maybe ten pieces of tomato. I asked for a manager who assured me that he would remake my salad (for the third time) himself. So while the rest of my group was already done with their meals I hadn't even began mine. Out of respect they all sat there with me while I finished when they could have been playing. I asked for free play or something since they were waiting for me and was laughed at. The waitress came at the end of our meal to verify how the check would be split then came back and said \"I didn't get your drinks so I don't know what check they go on\" when our checks arrived they were incorrect. They did however remove my salad from our bill. Altogether this place is extremely overpriced. My fiancé and I spent $50 with $30 free play for less than 500 play tokens and ended with around 2,000 tickets which warranted 2 coffee mugs, an infuser cup and a travel coffee cup! He got Philly cheesesteak sliders with fries (all cold) and a coke and the bill was $20. Also, our bar tab for a bud light and a frose was $15. Bad service, rude people, overpriced, gross food... we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is awful. The restaurant was at approximately 60% capacity, it took 40 minutes (because they were so busy) to get a double burger, a kids burger and kids chicken tenders. All were overcooked, the chicken was luke warm. The kids enjoyed the games. Do yourself a favor, Eat somewhere else beforehand."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot and frequent it however, there is a guy \"REMI\" or \"REMY\", who gets to wear a 'MANAGER' \"suit\" but has no idea how to manage himself!!! He is absolutely miserable and rude. He is rude to the servers and has no problem literally pushing himself between them and the register, all with a sour attitude. He is rude to customers, rolling his eyes if they have a legit complaint or question, and, he apparently doesn't like to honor the company policy of military discount without snyde comments. What's this jerks name you may ask again? It's Remy or Remi, however he chooses to spell it. He needs to be put in the back of the kitchen, making french fries, because he does not know how to be respectful to those workers that are making him look good and receive the \"brownie points\". What a disgrace he is to this establishment! Get better managers D&B! If I was a server there, he'd never be able to push me around with his rolie polie olie short self! Then again, I refuse to work for jerks.  I feel sorry for the wait staff that has to work under him. PLEASE CORPORATE, I know I am NOT the only one who has witnessed his offensive behavior and comments. Please address this \"problem child\" you have.  I'd give more stars but he's squashed that for you."}
{"text":"Went there last night and had a lot of fun playing the games. It was even half price token night which was really cool. They have a great selection of video, ticket and carnival games. Very innovative games and alot of stuff that I've never seen before. Then we went to get food...... first let me say that the wife and I both work in restaurants on the strip but try not to be super critical because we realize that the casinos are more strict about the customer service aspect of the job. We walked up to the hostess(Danielle) and asked her if kids were allowed on the dining side to which she answered with a very short yeah and then just kinda looked at us. I said \"three\" because I felt it was my responsibility to break the awkward silence. She then walked us to the table and set the menus down and walked away without saying anything. We thought maybe she was just having a bad night but the longer we sat there we noticed her turning around to glare at us on several occasions and even saw her walk a couple to their table while literally looking up at the ceiling rolling her eyes. She looked very unfriendly to say the least. After that the server came over and was really nice. Her name was Jasmine. We ordered the pretzel dogs and the rib,chicken and shrimp platter. Everything was awesome! The ribs were delicious. We finished everything and decided to order the regular order of ribs but wanted to sub out the honey bourbon barbeque for the sweet chili sauce we had already gotten because my wife is allergic to alcohol and we really like the first set of ribs. Any way long story short the ribs came out with the bourbon bbq sauce and not the sweet chili soy that we requested. We told our server and she said she would fix the problem and bring them back for us. Then the manager came to the table and asked what the issue was with the ribs. We told him we just wanted the honey chili soy sauce instead of the bourbon bbq to which he rudely replied \"did you even try the sauce? Because i did and those ribs had the chili sauce on them.\" I explained that we just got the trio and the sauce that came on the 2nd ribs was absolutely not the same as the 1st set from the trio. The sauce was darker and looked more like bbq sauce than the 1st set from the trio. The manager seemed annoyed so we got upset and just cancelled the ribs and left. So all in all the gaming arcade aspect was amazing! Restaurant side was mediocre.....I left feeling very annoyed about the manager arguing with me even though he was the one who didn't know what he was talking about. I thought management was supposed to make the situation better not worse."}
{"text":"Don't buy the dealchicken!! We got there tonight, (Friday night) and attempted to use the 4 dealchicken.com coupons we purchased to have a fun night. First off, the hostess was rude and impatient in explaining the deal to us. It says all non ticket games are unlimited but let me tell you that 90% of the games have tickets and the ones that don't have lines. Not to mention that a roll of sweet tarts cost over 200 tickets in the store. I wouldn't waste my time or $ again. Tried to order an appetizer but waited forever and ended up leaving and going to get fast good.  Had issues with the card too. Had to have the tech's come over and fix games... Buyers beware!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered:  Fish and Chips: I'd give it a 2/10, it was that bad. was overpriced considering it was one piece of fish that tasted like it was microwaved. Coronarita drink: Surprisingly good, so 8/10, will most likely come back for drinks at least. Hottie Burger: Slightly better than the Fish/chips, but not by much. Not as low as McDonalds, but should have been much better considering the price. 3/10  Overall, a sticky and overpriced experience, from the menus to the seats and the table. Too scared to try more food, unless I ask others beforehand what for sure tastes good so that I'm not disappointed again."}
{"text":"Met up with friends on a Saturday night, so it was packed. Later in the night the number of children dropped. For something out of the ordinary, it's a good time but a but a bit expensive."}
{"text":"I have been to Dave and Buster's a few times over the years. Last night was the first time I had been upstairs to the outside deck. It was pretty nice actually. We got prime seating over at the end of the deck, away from all of the noise from the other parties. It was perfect temp for being outside and having some drinks with friends. Live music was playing below which was a nice touch but it was a little too loud at times, the band was just okay.   I did not have any food on this visit but my friends had ordered some nachos which were covered in way too much guacamole making them soggy very quickly. My other experiences with food here have been not the best so they lose a couple of stars here. The drinks were pretty good. I just had wine so I can't say to many bad things about wine but a couple of my girlfriends had fruity cocktails which they said tasted like sugar water, yuck. My guy friends had blue moon and bud draft which was good. Overall drinks and food are just mediocre.  We did not play games on this recent trip but that is always a good time especially after some drinks. It looks as if they have added some new games recently so I might be back in a few weeks to give them a spin."}
{"text":"Ghetto, the server kept calling me baby all night. Staff is rude. Half the games don't work. The food is the only good thing this place has because it's somewhat unique. I did a survey that was on my receipt and gave my negative experience and it said a a manger would be in touch based on my answers and it's been a week and no call. What a joke."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Drinks are fun and exciting ! Video   Game selection is great !!!!! It's finally in vegas :) I could be here everyday ! I don't understand the low star reviews ! It's a place to be an adult and act like a kid ! Just fun !"}
{"text":"My family and I went to our to have a game night and dinner we have a 1-1/2 year old we ordered or food and they forgot all about us and our order, we waisted about an hour before anyone talked to us again. Pretty much waisted our whole night out."}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday night and it was busy, as expected. We sat at the bar and the service was terribly slow. It's a bug bar and they are busy and they need more than 3 bartenders.  The food was delicious. I got a side cesar salad which was awesomely big and delicious. Our drink were perfect the first round and too strong the 2nd.  We played some games and I love that you no longer have to carry around tickets. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"I rarely give bad reviews but this was one of the top 10 worst restaurants that my friends and I have ever eaten in. We were all starving so we ordered appetizers which promptly came out with our food even though we ordered our food over 20 minutes after ordering appetizers. Our food was all cold and none of it was anything that we would ever order again. My brother got skewers. They were all cold and the shrimp was way overcooked. My husband got a salad with steak on it and it was cold overcooked steak. The drinks are OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced. I paid $12 for an 8oz Margarita!!! Ridiculous!!! Our waiter tried to charge me for multiple things that we ordered but never received. Our waiter never refilled our glasses once. He had to come over to the table 4 times to try and straighten out our bill even after we went line by line reviewing it with him, and it took like 25 minutes for him to come back the last time. We felt like we were held hostage by a horrible waiter in a HORRIBLE RESTAURANT. My friends and I will NEVER step foot back in that place again. It was a horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Your run of the mill Dave and Busters. Nothing special, food mediocre. Games are pretty pricey but the family enjoyed. The quesadilla was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great place to go play games but I don't  advise eating there EVER!! The food was NOT good, and, by not good..I mean leaving there not cashing in our tickets to run to the nearest toilet. Not just me but my entire party. Ugh. I had higher hopes."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a long time and was very disappointed from the time we sat down. They sat us where there wasn't a waiter on yet, but at least the hostess asked for our drinks. We ordered fountain drinks and then we were told the machine was out of carbonation so we settled for water. We then ordered the loaded tator tots, only to be told that they were out of tots already and it was 2:30! I guess people don't come here for the food, just games."}
{"text":"The food is actually really good. Like alot of people said on here, I was really surprised! Been back once a week since!  Plus, you can't really beat the Happy Hour! And Salsa dancing."}
{"text":"All my party's Food came out cold. For this price could of went Texas Roadhouse for a decent warm meal. The menus were sticky and disgusting. I didn't want to touch the menu. Be awhile before I come back here"}
{"text":"7 min before a server came to our table ...ill update once I actually get my food ...if I ever do"}
{"text":"If you like chaos, this is the place for you! While I had a lot of fun, it was definitely an overwhelming experience due to all the game options. There is so much going on here and when there's a crowd, it seems like mayhem. When we went, it was very crowded and we had to wait for a lot of the games, but other than that, it was really fun. We were able to load money onto Power Cards which was easier than expected. Once you have money on your Power Card, you use this card to pay for games. As you win games, you get tickets that are uploaded to your Power Card and then you can cash out your tickets for prizes at then end. The prizes are typical arcade/carnival prizes, but the more tickets you win, the better the prize. I went with a group and we were able to pool our tickets together to get one of the nicer prizes. The bar was nice, but drinks were a little expensive, especially the signature cocktails. We didn't eat here, but everything smelled good. Keep in mind that this is a big place, so if you're with a big group, you'll probably get separated. The crowd was a 50/50 mix of young children and older people looking to drink and play games. Overall, it was a fun time."}
{"text":"I encountered no issues today, and it was only the second day open. Usually there are some things that come up, but not today. The service was great, our server was very friendly and attentive. Our appetizers and main dishes wrer great tasting, and in presentation. The atmosphere was fun and energetic, and the aircon was arctic! A overall great experience.  Will travel across town to go again."}
{"text":"We came here on a holiday Saturday night because  we thought it would be an easy place to grab a drink.   Parking was easy and close and convenient.   Service - no one really attended to us - we sat at a table and then maybe 10 min later after looking around and asking someone finally came to give us menus, and then 10 min later they took our order. Service was super slow all around at the seated tables. My guess is it's probably better to just grab a drink at the bar instead it waiting so long.  The games were fun - we spent a couple hours playing and enjoyed it: the points added up to pretty crazy prizes though so I would say don't let a prize be your primary motivation for coming here:   Lastly the bathrooms were absolutely filthy and disgusting. In the ladies bathroom 3/4 of the stalls were out of order, it smelled bad and looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly in a long time.  Highly doubt we will ever come here again: drinks were average, mojito was like drinking sugar syrup and the tequila shots were harsh and disgusting!"}
{"text":"Not quite a fan. It is nice place. You can get drinks and food. It is pretty chill.  I have noticed there are pool tables on the way in. But I have only played in the arcade and games. They have nice collection, but it misses all the ones I like, it would not hurt to have a gundam or more rhythm games. =p My cousin likes the Jurassic Park game, it is old school and even better, you can play together."}
{"text":"Well service sucked I had a group of people took 10min for some one to get to are table I had to get management to get involved not a good experience"}
{"text":"Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"The games are ok. They are kind of expensive for what you get but you can have a little fun. Kids of course have the most fun..  The bar... $12 for a drink with little to no alcohol. The bar itself is nice but not worth the money Bathrooms... atrocious... they stink (pee and mildew), walls are falling apart, out of order (photos attached)..."}
{"text":"First time at Dave and Buster's, now that one finally reached Las Vegas. I enjoyed the atmosphere to be a grown kid again playing the games.  I ordered a sirloin steak with mashed potatoes in a lobster sauce with bacon wrapped shrimp. My food was good and I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp.....they were very flavorful.  We had a few rounds of drinks and shots, the long beaches were tasty and strong, had green apple shots that were to die for and you could keep the shot glass it came, and the Scooby shot. The Scooby shot was ok, but I enjoyed the other drinks.  My overall experience was good and I plan on returning, the only complaint is the waitress that we had was slow to approach us when we first seated ourselves."}
{"text":"Horrible service, lukewarm food. Save your money & go elsewhere! Ordered wings & ribs. The wings were soggy like if they've been sitting for a while. The ribs were very fatty & also tasted as if they've been sitting. Not impressed one bit. Waitress kept forgetting about us. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Took my daughters out of school so we could have a father/daughter day of lunch and games! The front desk was helpful and informative, told us about the game cards and the eat and play special. We set at the open seating area by one of the bars, and our server Madison greeted us quickly and was very friendly. The service time was great, food was great for what is offered, the only change I would make is maybe offer a few kid friendly choices for the eat andnplay promotion. I would suggest our server Madison to anyone that wants to enjoy a meal served by a  friendly, upbeat, personable, and tenative server. I know we will be asking to sit in her section we ever we return for another visit!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. This place has gone down hill.  Hadn't been here in years (since it opened) and to say I was disappointed is an understatement.   The drinks we ordered were okay, my boyfriend thought it was to syrupy.   We ordered edamame... Only we never received it.   For our entree I ordered burger sliders, that were decent. My boyfriend ordered a burger as well (the hottie).  We received our food, and come to find out his burger was microwaved...... Terrible.   The service was slow, the drinks were mediocre, and the food was eh.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is great but I got the chocolate fondu plate and it was cold chocolate. Got bad brownies and wasn't impressive. My waiter was awesome just not the dessert"}
{"text":"Thank you to everyone who helped and offered help last night at my sons 1st birthday ! birthday boy had a blast! Thank you for everything ! Food was fast and great! Service was outstanding! Thank you to our waiters for keeping our drinks filled and making sure everyone was happy !"}
{"text":"Two stars: 1 for our server and 1 for the games.   Our server was super nice and very attentive. So sorry I didn't get her name, but nice girl with short black hair with a fade. She was awesome!   The games were expensive, yes, but that is to be expected. It was worth the money to get some fun, vibrant, LED games. We had a blast!   The 3 stars it is lacking comes with the restaurant hostess staff, the game redemption staff and the food. We had never been there before and I had my underage daughter with me. We walk up to the front of the restaurant, 3 feet from them, and they act like they don't see us. But we're making eye contact. No one speaks. Finally, I speak up forcing them to address me. I simply wanted to know \"Where can I sit with her to eat?\"  I was told \"anywhere\". Um, okay. Wow.   We sit to in the restaurant to eat some food. The menus make the food look awesome.....it's a lie. The food was close to inedible. I didn't complain, because I was afraid they would bring me more disgusting food. I had the burger. It tasted like bad meat and was very fishy. The cheese was burnt too. It was horrible. My stomach turned trying to eat it. The fries were okay. Some kind of seasoning makes them weird too. I ask for ranch. That's safe, right? Wrong. Even the ranch tastes like rosemary or something strange in it. Yuck.   My daughter had the little pretzel dogs. Basically, pigs in a blanket. The wieners tasted and looked like beef jerky and the crescent rolls seemed raw. I didn't say anything to her about my food. She says \"Mommy, this is gross.\" So there you have it.   Fast forward to after we ate and played games. The two very young girls running the prize area were very nice but just need some training on what to talk about and not talk about in front of customers. I'm not a prude, I could care less. I just imagine some people might not like the awkwardness. I walked up with my daughter and the girl says very loudly to me \"Yeah, this day is going to totally SUCK.\"  Lovely. She was nice just needs to chill with that to customers.   All in all, I would go back for some games, maybe. But eat before you go and don't go if you don't want the loudest experience of your life next to a concert."}
{"text":"It's safe to say I will never be coming back here! Invited all my friends on my bday bc I had never been and thought it'd be fun. The bartenders were so rude right from the beginning and they wasted so much of our time we had barely any time to play games even tho we showed up 2 hours before close. + they shut the games off early. I saw numerous other customers complain about the bartenders and when I complained to the manager he was just as rude and only said sorry and did nothing to make it right. I will most likely be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH! I get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place. On top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day. The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line. Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less.  I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it.  After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything.  All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!! Cam here for a friends bday to watch the fights and celebrate on a Saturday night. i feel like this place has changed ALOT and taken a 180 since i was a kid. I mean FUN ON TAP (SEE MY PHOTO), DJ AT 9PM UNTIL CLOSE, GAMES LIKE YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE. This place was super fun and defintely the spot to be at. no cover charge to watch the fights. probably one of the only places not to charge a cover. good food, great prices!"}
{"text":"While I wouldn't go here for an Indie-Rock Night-Out (TM), there are certainly worse places to go for those very special nights out after work, like someone's last day, you met your speeding ticket quota for the month, etc. The food is decent, beer selection OK, and the video-game choices are pretty good. It was the first time I spent more than five dollars on video games since I was 12. My Street Fighter skills have seen better days.  Like someone else said, this is like Vegas without the sex and gambling. Wait, maybe that's Branson..."}
{"text":"The adult Chuck E. Cheese! Good food and good drinks. Took my son here for his birthday and he had a great time. This is a great place for older kids and their parents to be. Also makes for a great date place. Would come here again for sure!"}
{"text":"This location sucks to put it bluntly... just something strange and uncomfortable about it and the workers, supposed to be a sports game place yet the sound was so low could barely hear ufc and its saturday... boring atmosphere asked twice to turn up sound straining to hear, totally lame, didnt even want to order anything because we couldnt wait to leave wont be returning."}
{"text":"I have been trying to speak to someone from there over the telephone: operator picks up phone, \"Thank for calling Dave & Buster's, Please hold\"  And she has done this about 5X in a row tonight, before I could even respond \"ok\" or \"sure!\" You may put me on hold.  Very very unprofessional!!!! . Do you guys want my business or not???!! I am trying to inquire and book a kid's party for 20+ kids plus parents, a total of about 40 people!! You just lost a potential booking!!!! Your people need proper phone etiquette and PEOPLE SKILLS. PERIOD!!!"}

The state of repair on the games made this a voyage of discovery, e.g, with a 2 hour unlimited card I could work out which machines actually worked:)   .I'd rather have a downed machine than something that is unplayable but maybe I'm just unlucky that I hit the 4/5 games with issues in my first plays.

{"text":"Aman needs to be fired. Simple as that. I've been in the service industry for 15 years and have never been so disrespected at any establishment in my life. Seeing as how I'm in the same line of work, I am very understanding and forgiving. However, I will never tolerate someone that is rude and disrespectful, especially someone in a managerial position. You literally have one job, which is to ensure that your staff is providing excellent customer service and if service is falling short it is your responsibility to correct the problem at hand. Aman, you failed at this with flying colors. The bar staff was very friendly and apologetic, though service was very lacking. Showed up to the established around 10:15, bar closes at 12. Ordered a round of drinks, one drink came out incorrectly but was consumed nonetheless, no big deal. Attempted to order food, pretzel dogs and loaded tots, waited about 20 minutes before inquiring about our food which we soon came to realize was never ordered due to miscommunication between the bar back and bartender. No big deal, ordered another drink and the food was apparently put in this time around. Food finally came out about 20 minutes later but the order was wrong, we were delivered some sort of pizza bites tho 2 of us don't eat cheese and specified the cheese to be on the side for the tater tots anyways. Then we were told the kitchen was closing so we said no bid deal we will survive without it but were convinced it was no big deal and we could get the proper order with no issues. The proper item was delivered after another 20 minutes and another slow round of drinks later (it's been over an hour now, mind you). But the food showed up nonetheless and it was good after all. However, after all is said and done the bill was dropped and the original incorrect item was on the bill. When acquiring why the original charge was still on the bill, we were informed that it was because both items were the same price. However, after waiting over an hour to get a proper item delivered, it was obviously ludicrous to be paying full price for the staffs mistakes as well as their  lack of sympathy. That is when we asked to speak to a manager. This is when Aman stepped up to the plate to disappoint us further. Aman instantly came over with an attitude, he made it very clear right off the bat that he had no interest in hearing the problem at hand. His first instinct was to assume we were just trying to get a free hand out, which was not the case at all. We had already ordered 10 drinks and 2 food items within the hour and a half we were there and money was no issue. It was the lack of communication and management that was the problem. Though Aman showed no interest in hearing what we had to say, I proceeded to tell him the issues we experienced. He instantly got defensive with us and I explained that if a food item is refired for any reason, it is his responsibility (as the manager on duty) to be aware he f the issue and correct it. He apparently had zero insight that there was even an issue in the first place, which is a major problem. He instantly accused us of trying to get a free item since we \"ate the whole thing\" mind you we waited over an hour for said item and that's after it was negligently never put into the computer and then ordered incorrectly after the fact. He then decided the best way to solve said problem was to tell the customer (aka me and my two coworkers) that he WAS going to help us, but now we can pay full price. He clearly didn't like my 2 cents on how he was failing to do his job. Very mature coming from a grown man in a managerial position. Like I said, I've been in the industry for over a decade, I know how to properly solve guest issues and I have had many managers who know how to do their job. Aman is a disgrace to the industry and if he remains in management, he will run this business into the ground. Simple as that. If you wonder why you have a 3 star rating, you should probably start by shopping your horrible staff."}
{"text":"I come to this location a lot. I do not come for the fantastic service because that is really lacking here. I come for the awesome cheesesteaks and beer. If you are looking for a place that pays attention to you and offers exceptional services, you may want to look somewhere else, this is not that place. I once waited 45 minutes for a cheesesteak an I was one of two people in the place. I can go on and on with stories about bad service here so I will not. I will tell you they have good food if you have a lot of patience."}
{"text":"food is ehh here. But the games are fun if you come with a few friends. Drinks are never consistent, one day they will be pure sugar and the next it will be the best pours ever.. but you have to expect that going into a place like this."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 stars I would. There was only 2 tables seated in the restaurant section and we waited a good 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge that we were standing there waiting to be seated. Once we were seated it took another 10 minutes or more for them to come take my groups drink order. We ordered the loaded tots, which tasted fine, but they didn't give our group of 7 any small plates to use for them (since we are at a long table) I had to ask for them. Which took another 10 minutes for her to bring them. My friend and I got drinks from the bar thst were good. But that's about it. The only good service we got was from the person who brought us our food. My boyfriend took my son to the men's room and it was absolutely disgusting. There was poop all over all the stalls and all over all the floors. I'll never come here again. We came here to have a good family night and it was a disaster."}
{"text":"Not happy at all. Went on a waiting list at 730 for a table. They said it would take about an hour to an hour and a half. Signed up and headed to the bar. 20 mins to get a drink while seated at a bar stool with a group of 4 with no eye contact made from any staff. Couldn't  even lean against the bar due to some sticky unclean bar table.  Bought a card for the games which took another 20 mins. Some didn't work but gladly took my credits.  At 9 headed back to the front hostess to check if our table was ready. She just said no they are busy cleaning them with no estimated time available.  The group I was with left and went to another food place in the area.  Around 10pm got the text saying our table was available.  Overall they must be understaffed on bartenders, cooks, waiters and waitresses and cleaning staff.  Not a good experience at all"}
{"text":"Decent happy hour specials but the servers NEVER know what they are.  Be prepared to have the website up on your phone so you can show them what they are in print.  Servers and bartenders are the worst I have seen almost ever.  They stand around at the end of the bar and B.S.  Last time I was there I LITERALLY had to get up and ask for everything I needed.  The games are fun, bathrooms clean and plenty of parking.  Come early, beat the crowds but don't eat and even waste a second with the worthless bartenders who can give a squirt of piss about making a dime.  The manager should be fired for letting such nonsence go on..."}
{"text":"Dave & Busters is a fun place to game & eat. Now you can even have more fun with tons of new screens for games and a newly renovated Dining Area! The food is always good but pricey for pub fare. Purchase a game and play package to offset the food prices and you'll get more bang for the buck! My biggest complaint I have to say is the service. The servers are always friendly enough but after several visits of late I have had to wait for a server for more than 10 minutes before being greeted for my drink/food order.. They don't seem organized, could be understaffed? Hope this improves as school goes back.."}
{"text":"So when a friend told me that D&B was a bar with a full arcade, my immediate reaction was \"What!?  Seriously!?  When are we are going to go!?!?\" and I guess I should have known from her luke warm reaction (which was a look that said \"ahhh YOU can go anytime YOU want\") that it sounded much better on paper than in reality.  The first time I entered the door the overwhelming sports theme was so obnoxious that I just couldn't handle it and I turned around and left.  Last night my (beautiful) date was up for bar food and this was our only option.  And what do you know?  First impressions do matter! And sometimes you CAN judge a book by it's cover.  I had a $20 steak which was tough, fatty and included NO FRIES/POTATOES and NO SALAD!  Not exactly a great value.  Plus it sucked ass.  That said, I've got to say, my favorite part of the experience was, that even though this place is a huge cheesy sports bar full of harmless bright shinny suburban clones ... for some reason, management feels the need to have, not one, not two, not three but FOUR fat bouncers to greet you at the door.  A very scary place indeed!  **  FYI, if your the type that likes the genre of big shinny sports an/ or dance bars ... you really need to discount this, and all of my Yelps!  Clearly this place is popular (or it wouldn't be a corporate chain)."}
{"text":"Just like Gameworks, they have a card you load with money, however, most of the games didn't take the card or you have to swipe twice for the machines to actually read it which is annoying. There weren't many fun games. The prize room was disappointing. Not many options for toys in all ranges. They also didn't give me back my daughters card which still had 200 tickets on it. So I was walking around the prize room trying to find it and they did not acknowledge this at all even though it was at their desk until I came up to them and let them know I couldn't find it. Gameworks at Townsquare is definitely better."}
{"text":"The pool tables at this venue are in fairly good condition. That's about it. Terrible service, flat (and overpriced) beer, and a game room with outdated machines make this Dave & Buster's the opposite of a destination.  Edited: Downgraded from 2 stars to 1. I had to confront management a second time (major pool tournament) about completely absent and inattentive service. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We like Dave and busters we came here after dinner just to goof off and play some games !   We got the reload able card for coins . And it also saves your tickets on it ! So cool ...   We will be back !   If you never been here it is very loud !  And kids running around everywhere but it is great place to go for fun games prizes and decent food !   Good for families and young adults !  I like that they keep bringing in newer games had a blast playing the game called fish bowl ! Lots of fun !"}
{"text":"This place just plain sucks Bad management lost them biz Dumb arcade drama*  * they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in an establishment. We stopped in for a quick drink and snack around 10:30 pm. Knowing they closed at 12. Service was a bit slow, although very friendly. We were informed it was Mike's first night and he used to be a barback. The bartender Afton was very nice. Once we had our first round we asked each of them for another. Got one. Then waited. And waited. The bar was busy and all 3 of us are in the industry so we gave the the benefit of the doubt. We then mentioned to Mike we wanted to order food. We were joking around and he laughed and said ok and walked away. It was about 20 mins later and we asked Afton if our food was about ready. She said Mike didn't put it in and so she did. We were just enjoying ourselves on a girls night out so we ignored it... Then the food came out wrong. She thought we ordered pizza bites. But we said pretzel bites. But was strange since we said we don't eat cheese and the pizza bites have cheese all over them.. Easy mistake? The kitchen was about to close so we said forget it. But she insisted and said it was fine so we said ok. They finally came out and they were closing so we got the bill. I then asked if the pizza bites and pretzel bites were the same price and they informed us they were after much discussion... And we asked if they were sure and they said yes(we didn't see the menu again, they had been picked up) and so my friend asked to speak to a manager just to inform him of the issue. We weren't trying to get anything for free. Should we have paid for them, no. Were we going to, yes. The manager Aman came over asked asked 'what our problem was'. We explained and then He then was very condescending and asked us why it was a problem was since \"we ate them all\" . Of course we ate them. We ordered them and there was nothing wrong with them. We just waited an hour. My friend then was just telling him that he should've just checked on the situation and maybe ran the refired item in question and he seemed very unaware of what had been going on in the bar area and with his guests.. We hadn't seen him touching base with any customers all night. He then thrust the receipt at us and said he \"WAS going to take care of it..But now we can just pay\" and stormed away. I have never been so spoken down to in such a condescending way by a 'manager' in my entire life.  If this was a restaurant on the strip he would NEVER have spoken to us that way. Whether we had 1 drink or 11 there was no reason for him to be that rude. I know that if we had a man with us he never would have spoken to us in such a manner. His body language/attitude and management skills are severely lacking. A manager should be leading by example. Which is extremely upsetting. Its sad that a \"fun\" place such as D&B would EVER employ such an individual. Get it together. I'm not a huge negative yelper but this was completely unacceptable, and a way in which guests should never be treated and everyone should be aware."}
{"text":"So....I take the kiddos here to do some gaming.  I have yet to read anything good about the food, so we don't bother.  We have cards that we have bought in the past so I wanted to use those.  Well the cards have gotten worn out and I wanted to transfer the credit/ticket to two new cards.  This was like pulling teeth.  It's like I was speaking another language on something that should have been sooooo simple.   Yet they could not get it done.  Sadly we will go back because my kids do enjoy it.   I just hope we don't end up having lose the cards and credits/tickets on them.  Update...same games.  But the food was actually really good.  I wish o could rate the restaurant separate from the gaming area.  Kids meals were solid.  The steak and shrimp combo was cooked as requested and just really good."}
{"text":"Bowling! Not every Dave and Busters has bowling, but this one does (Desert Ridge).. It a fun place to drink and play games at. Always a good time. I actually bowled a 200 here.. must have been the beer. :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely go during their $10 weekday happy hour! You get unlimited video games for an hour starting once you swipe for the first game. (Doesn't include skeeball or the old fashioned games with actual balls) Their happy hour drink prices are so good! I think it's half off signature cocktails? Whatever it was, I paid $4 for a fancy mixed drink. The only negatives is I wish they had more games to choose from. I did the happy hour card like 3 times in 6 months and got tired of the same games. Next time will try a different location of D and B hoping for fresh games."}
{"text":"I love Dave and Busters... Maybe because I am an adult that refuses to grow up (I mean adulting is way overrated!). Yeah can you blow a small fortune on arcade games.. totally, but it brings you back to your childhood with the added bonus of being able to hit the skee ball machine with a cocktail in hand!  They change out the games pretty frequently so there is always something new to explore, the food isn't half bad, the cocktails are good, the service is adequate and they keep things pretty tidy."}
{"text":"Games were great! Food was under cooked and my nephew ended up with food poisoning. Wait was 45 minutes to eat but we didn't mind because we played until our time was up."}
{"text":"Out of all the locations in the valley for D and B this my family's favorite spot! Sign up for their coupons online and they will always hook you up. We have only ever eaten at this location and it is okay but you know you really go for the games. So check it out on 1/2 price game night which is Wednesday!"}
{"text":"So when we got there we went to the hostess stand and they ignored us so we went to another stand and no one came finally another patron asked the bartender where can we sit and we were told it was open seating so once we found a spot we were set, that is why I can't give it 5 stars. The food was great. We really enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken Sliders, the loaded tots, and the chicken fingers. The games were great too just too expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered a New York striploin that was amazing!!! The spinach dip was somewhat lacking though...it was a very small portion of dip. The deep fried pickles were great! Waiter was a little nervous however but seriously that steak...it was fantastic! First visit to D&Bs ever and it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Attended the grand opening. Was able to get seated right away when we went to eat. Had a caveman combo. Fries and sliders were great. The ribs not so much. Service was on point as our waitress kept coming to check on us and helped us with all the questions we asked.  As for the game experience it was fun. A lot of new and updated games to play."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and I was excited to go because it's closer to home and it was with my co-workers for a work gathering. The inside is well decor'd however what made it a 1 star rating is the service. My friends and I walked from the bar to the dining area where my other co-workers were and we accidentally walked in their station. We apologized and the female employee says, 'well don't do it again!' Wow, we knew after walking through it was their station. Human mistake and very rude. Next the waiter for our dining experience was great in the beginning but something seemed very odd. Our boss was with us and he was great when he was around; brown nosing him, saying 'whatever you want boss', 'you got it boss'. Until he left (our boss) is when he got bad..Two of us ordered drinks that paid cash, the rest paid with card. We both required change. My tab was $4.13 and I gave him $10.00. I think he was under the impression the change was his tip! When I asked my friend if she got her change after he brought back the others their cards back, she said no. I haven't also. I asked him where's  my change? He looked at me puzzled and says oh you got that drink? He say's what? I told him I gave you a $10 and my drink was $4.13, so where's my change? He thought for a second and say's oh don't worry I got you and proceeds to take out $5.00 from his pocket and tells my co-worker who ordered a Coors light that cost $3.99 that she has no change only 10 cents! So what! It's still money! And than he changes his story and says her beer was not $3.99 it's $4.99 so there's no change. She say's what so I owe you? How can that be, I bought beer at the bar for $3.99. He says oh, no your beer is not $3.99 it's $4.90 and the price is different at the bar than from the dinning. WTH?! Is this guy for real? She let it go because it was pennies to her. Oh not me! He forgot to bring 2 more silverware that we asked for earlier, he kept forgetting to bring the others drinks and when I asked, where's my 87 cents, AGAIN he looked puzzled. He says, oh I don't carry change??So...do the right thing! I want my receipt I said and he finally came back with is apologizing but it's too late now. It may be only 87 cents but that adds up and I bet he's sorry now for the terrible service because he would've got something but instead got nothing. I want to bring my family back I just don't know if we will dine because of the negative experience. This happened on December 18, 2015 and our servers name is JT."}
{"text":"Just opened - went to the grand opening and had a great time. Happy a Dave & Busters is now in Las Vegas. It's nice to have some entertainment that doesn't include gambling. An additional bonus is its location at a great outdoor mall with other activities as well (i.e., movie theater)."}
{"text":"I personally don't see the big deal with this place. Don't go on a Friday after work, horrible decision. The food is overpriced and terrible. Drinks are nothing special. Servers need better training. I thought this place was for adults? No, it was full of nothing but bratty Summerlin kids."}
{"text":"Loved the food here and the drinks. I was surprised how great it was. I wish I lived closer to this location for sure!"}
{"text":"Useless employees. Work had a function here with a few dozen people spending several thousand dollars and a lot of people couldn't even get a refill of their drinks. Will never ever suggest going to this POS place again. Stay away. Also , most games are ticket based and not fun."}
{"text":"Excellent fun for all ages (even this mom of teenagers!). Lots of game choices from arcades type video games to skill games like skeeball.  They offer food and drink, but we just jumped into the games!"}
{"text":"Dear whoever, I love the drinks the service is always great but please please tell your waitresses to stop taking the extra change. Today I had $.77 coming back to me that I did now get. As little as it may be I was pissed off that the server felt the right to keep it. That's your tip now when it would have been well over 20%. Not cool.    So this is now the second bad review I'm going to leave for this devastating service experience once again. Had to go to the bartender after 15 minutes of waiting for the server to show up. As much of a jerk as I sound, I'm a server so I'm more than patient but this is ridiculous on a lazy mildly busy Friday afternoon. Still cheap beer and always tastes good but screwing up a beer is a little hard lol"}
{"text":"I just experienced Dave & Buster's for the first time after hearing so much about it.  I LOVED the restaurant and atmosphere!  We arrived right when they opened - 11:00 a.m. - and immediately sat down in the dining room for a bite to eat.  The menu has so much to take in...  we decided to order a few dishes and share everything.  We had the Mediterranean Hummus with veggies, Tomato Feta Soup, and the Pepperoni Pizza Pull-Apart Bread...  amazing choices and there is so much more we want to try.  After lunch, we played a few games...  ended up staying over an hour just checking out everything.  The \"redeem shop\" has some really cool items that I look forward to hopefully getting the next time I am there.  So much fun for a Saturday...  go check it out!"}
{"text":"We visited here two times  already 1st was my pre birthday celebration 2nd when i invited my co workers here it was awesome love playing here diffinetly will be back and try their food."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, waited 2 hours and didn't even get seated. We were originally told an hour and a half wait then move up to 2 hours, and then told 45 more minutes after 2 hours. The hostess then told me I was lying to her about the time I was told to wait. These people are about as rude as you can get! I will never ever come back to this place. I wouldn't even give them one star."}
{"text":"We had our work holiday party here last weekend and it was a wonderful experience. The staff was so amazing. They were very helpful, attentive and friendly. We had a group of about 40 and the area they set up for us was perfect. We did the buffet style dinner and it was good. Everyone came in on Monday and said they had a good time and thought the party was a success! Yay for me since I was in charge of planning it. :)  Our waiters Jacob and Michael were great. They so happen to be twin brothers and were very upbeat and friendly. We enjoyed their company very much. I can't remember the name of the manager working that night but she was also very attentive and checked on us a few times.   My boss bought all of us players cards and we enjoyed the unlimited number of games there are to play. I would say overall the food is okay, but the service and atmosphere are awesome! A fun night out for any occasion and great for work parties!"}
{"text":"This place is a waste of police officers (apparently police are regulars here, making sure people are over 19 at night, and aren't drunk driving).  The food here is THOROUGHLY unimpressive. I mean, these people managed to take potatoes, deep fry them, and have it still taste mediocre. How do you mess up deep-fried potatoes?! (I'm talking about their chips and potato balls when I say this.)  My friends and I didn't have time for the gaming area, but it's stupidly expensive anyway. This place is a fail... Seems like it's spreading itself too thin, trying to be everything. It needs to focus on fewer things and improve on those."}
{"text":"We went here a week ago. The food was ok. Poor and slow service. I will not bring people here and I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yikes what a hot mess. We were seated quickly and the girl was so polite and patient with us. Our waiter was super polite and helpful but he could not get our food right to save his life. We waited 40 minutes to eat and my daughter's food was completely mixed up, she ended up waiting longer for hers. It's a new location so we will try again."}
{"text":"Always have a decent time with solid food and service.  Came in one time with the Mrs. And  a visiting brother and his girl for drinks, 1/2 drinks late night happy hour. Rounds of shots, beers, girly drinks, shooters for $58 can't go wrong."}
{"text":"-Review is for arcade only-  I generally love arcades, but this place really let me down. Just the sheer overpricing brought this review down. I went, had 35$ spent, and lasted about 15 minutes. Even on Wednesday, you're not going to last very long because the games are still too overpriced. The games themselves are fun (which is why this got two stars instead of one) but the overpriced games makes me never want to come back."}
{"text":"OMG there's nothing to say but why is this place still in business.  You have to try to be this bad. You can't be this bad accidentally.  Service was HORRIBLE, the absolute worst!!! This is managements fault. There are tons of people out of work, fire whatever you have and hire new people because your business SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for a company team out . Great place for all ages . Food was great with lots of options for veggie n meat eaters . The cocktails were not great but they had a full bar.   Everyone had a great time at the arcade . Good place for groups and families with kids ."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind and have fun: games, food, drinks... in a non-gaming environment! That's not a given in Vegas. I am not a skilled gamer, and yet and found it entertaining. The crowd here tends to be young-er, but this place is good for all ages, and family friendly too."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday and we got lunch and played games for about 2 hours. The food was sub par. I got a chicken sandwich and it was dry and thin and the toppings were not flavorful. My mother-in-law got a burger and it was tiny and bland. Everyone else had ok food but nothing to write home about. The games were great. The layout is updated and easy to make your way through. The staff is essentially nonexistent though and the many adolescents running around were able to do whatever they wanted. The cost is high so for a day of fun so I would definitely recommend eating before you come as the food is expensive and not good."}
{"text":"I really don't frequent Desert Ridge, but it is close to my work and I came for lunch/drinks with a coworker.  It was in the middle of the day so I felt safe coming here.  NormallyI I would steer clear because of the obnoxious kid factor; but at noon on a Thursday you are safe.  We hopped upstairs to sit at the bar. There was nobody in there at all so we obviously received a ton of attention.  The middle of the day offers no specials at all; and I'm not sure that they have any at other times.    My coworker got the sliders and they looked fantastic. Who doesn't love tiny sammiches?  I got the quesadilla  and it was , well, a quesadilla.  Nothing to get excited about, but it was a good one.    It's a chain, and a reliable one at that.  Would I frequent this place at night?  No way. Kids annoy me.  But it was a different place to go for an end of the week lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Dave and busters since 2006--- talk about a long time ago! I was in high school. I noticed some remodeling taking place.   My dad's company was in town, they invited all the employees to Dave and busters. We all Received token cards with 100 coins!!!  Personally, I'm not into video games. However it was fun kicking my dads butt in Mario kart! We play two rounds, then jumped to the transformers game. Which never ended! We had maybe 70 to 60coins left, and decided to give the cards away to a nice couple.   Food was provided. And it was so great! We also received drink tickets. Unfortunately the tickets didn't cover specialty cocktails. I totally forgot there's a bowling alley here! If my nail wasn't broken! I would've played! Not sure if I'll come back. Maybe if I have my niece and nephew, i'm not into video games. Not to mention I live about 25 minutes away."}
{"text":"Me and a bunch of my friends decided to spend our night at D&B last night since we never do things like this before.  You'll probably need to do coat check if you're sitting at or near the bar since there is no way to hang your coat. Saturday night is obviously busy so service is slow for drinks and food. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries with their Miami Vice. It was pretty decent, nothing to complain about. After dinner we began to play games! Games range in credits and is pretty high compared to other arcade places. Me and my boyfriend got the $35 play card which lasted about 1.5 hours. There were several machines that weren't working or not turned on, which sucked. Furthermore, the game room and washrooms were pretty dirty and there weren't many/any people cleaning the place up. We ended with a decent amount of tickets that got us a Hello Kitty plushie, 2 whoopee cushions, and 2 piggy banks.  Overall, it was a fun night! However, everything is expensive! We spent about $75 that night."}
{"text":"Very negative experience. Our waitress less than stellar, had to ask for everything. Food made incorrectly. At the bar, due to allergy, asked if could leave out pineapple Juice and was told would be $2 extra to \"customize\" drink. If that wasn't bad enough, won large amount  of tickets on game and when called tech over because machine ran out of tickets, was told that machine had gone \"rogue\" and were not entitled to tickets. Manager took power card and removed all of the tickets won on that game from power card."}
{"text":"On Thursdays until 7:30pm there have half off liquor, which is a pretty good deal! The games are always such a fun time, great for groups, date night or just hanging out. The games do get fairly expensive, but a fun place!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to any Dave and Buster's and I was extremely disappointed with the food. There were three of us (my boyfriend, his friend and myself). We ordered the pretzel digs to start and then chicken fingers, Dave's burger medium rare and the bistro steak with shrimp and lobster alfredo. The entrees were delivered before the appetizer and when our friend commented on it, the waitress told him to \"just calm down\" because it would be here soon. My boyfriend's burger was well done, my plate was incredibly hot but my food was luke warm at best and had no taste. The sauce, shrimp and even the steak tasted like absolutely nothing. I couldn't even eat it because we didn't receive our silverware until the manager came over and by then the food was cold. He came over and we sent the burger back and when it was delivered again it was still well done. He decided against a third attempt. The manager, Chris A., was very understanding and took care of us for the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"I get that most places have growing pains, but my husband and I had a great time here. Good food and drinks and a lot of fun games to play. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I keep going here for UFC fights because it is a great venue to watch them at. HOWEVER, don't expect any resemblance of quality service at this joint.  The staff and management turnover since they opened is horrendous.  I only recognize one person from when they opened. And he is a busboy who rocks.  This means very little teamwork or camaraderie at all. With a lack of leadership, also this place is in so much  need of.     It takes forever to get initial service and even longer for any form of continued service. We had to stack our 8 empty water and beer glasses on the table just to get some service.  I always sit in the bar area because I am not a gamer and just want to watch the fights with some food and beers. But for some reason the bar is filled with unattended running children. You would think that with a dining room as large as it is that kids would not be allowed in the bar area.  It's like a fricken Chucky Cheese in there's when it gets busy.  One manager did comp us two beers because of the dreadful service. Which I appreciate. But it should never had come down to that.  The servers do not have large sections. And they have bussers and runners who do most of the work.  If the servers would stay on the floor and in there sections. That's all I really ask for.  All in all, just another disappointing night at D n B's."}
{"text":"This place is great! Came here for salsa dancing on Sunday night. It was so much fun and it was a very lively place! I would highly recommend this place if you wanna get your salsa on or just to hang out and play some games!"}
{"text":"BEWARE IDENTITY THEFT My identity was stolen on May 15th 2016 IMMEDIATELY after adding money to the power card using the Charging Station App!! There is no doubt that the app is responsible, they could prove me wrong if they called me back and of course I will take this down if they did. (This is the location we go to though, just in case) They had this same problem with hackers stealing identities for profit in 2008 and in 2014 with waiters stealing credit card information in Long Island. I have called them twice with no answer and don't want this to happen to anyone else. If they make it right, I will let you know. Until then, I feel a responsibility to warn others."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment hoping for a fun time where i can leave my two children in the car and forget about my responsibilities for a few hours.  At first i enjoyed the freindly environment and enjoyed the attractive waitresses, however things went south fast there were children everywhere and i am not a nice person aroud children when i drink...lol. these kids hogged up everygame the entire night leaving me creating my own entertainment  which involved staring at there young moms and older sisters. I wish there were no kids. After a few hours and a 3 course meal i decided to make my own fun.  I kicked a child off a racing game chair and they precided to cry like a little girl.  She was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong. After a few choice words with management i will never go back there again and will only lock my kids inside of my car somewhere more adult like seabase."}
{"text":"They have a cockroach problem seeing two on the bar the bartender just push them away thought that I didn't notice asked me what what I like I told the bartender I saw him what he did couldn't explain himself so I got up and left I think they pay off the health inspectors"}
{"text":"Service in the restaurant is slow. The waiters/waitresses have to run their own food. The lobster shrimp pasta is delicious. I ordered my steak that comes on it medium rare, it came out almost well done!  The only piece in the middle had some pink.  The other thing we ordered was buffalo wings, they came out with the main entree and was very cold. I asked the server if she could take it back to heat it up for us. She said yes , then took two orders at two different tables. When she can back to get the wings, she explained she had to put in another order because they couldn't take food back into the kitchen. As we had already waited 20 mins for the first order, I elected not to take the wings."}
{"text":"Ok, let me just start off by saying that I DON'T come here for the food.  It's not bad, but it sure ain't awesome.  What I come here for is:  The games (TRIVIA), the drinking while gaming, and the tickets that I can exchange for total garbage, like my totally sweet marshmallow shooter that I freeze marshmallows and then shoot people with.  I've had some awesome times here.  I was skeptical at first, but now I'm definitely a convert.  I'm just glad I wasn't thrown out for screaming curse words at trivia and not realizing there was a 10 year old next to me.  (Don't judge me, it was like 9 at night, what was he doing in there???)"}
{"text":"Had a firm social here, lots of fun! Though that could be attributed to the free power cards we had courtesy of our company.. There was one plushie I wanted that took us more than $80 worth of power cards to get.  It's definitely spacious though, we had a scavenger hunt with over 8 groups from our firm while also sharing the space with regular customers.  Fun night! Food is also not bad, chicken fingers were too dry but sliders were good :)   Good for group events if you ever feel like an arcade night :)"}
{"text":"Although this location hasn't officially opened, they are already on the right track. They had a soft opening today and the staff functioned like a well-oiled machine. The dinner & dessert buffet stayed stock with items from their catering menu.  There wasn't a long wait at the bar. They signature cocktails were available on tap. If you like to watch sports, there are a ton of TVs in the bar area. Pineville is usually quiet during the night. I can see this place livening up the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Horrible customer service, took two hours to get our food. Security at the door checked ID, and wouldn't let my 18 year old cousin in- at 7PM! It wasn't even close to 10, which was when all minors are supposed to leave. We were forced to leave ID at the door for no reason at all, and then when we went back to get it, security didn't know where it was. Our waitress was beyond rude, and there were several waiters standing around doing nothing while we had to wait forever to even place an order. They were not accommodating at all when extra guests showed up with our party either. Absolutely horrible, save yourself and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you go to their website, you can get $10 of free game tokens per person. That makes the $25 package only $15. That lasts for about an hour or so on the game floor. The game center isn't that big... only about the size of a large Chuck E' Cheese. Don't expect too much here. The food, however, was excellent. We got wings, fries, and a steak sandwich. The food seems expensive by looking at the menu, but you can excape with a sandwich, drink and tip for $15/person. Somebody suggests this place for kids. No way. Think of Chuck E' Cheese with better food, and hundreds of drunken teens and adults. It would be a good spot for drinking or a group outing--- perhaps a date, if you don't mind all the alcohol. Open until 1AM on Friday/Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is great to take the family for some entertainment and food. It is pricey and can sometimes be really crowded but overall a fun time"}
{"text":"Took our sales team out for a team builder. Bowled, $35 per hour and $3.00 bowling shoes. Lane kept malfunctioning but onsite bar and appetizers kept everyone happy. At the end of the night, we were comped for one lane for the trouble."}
{"text":"I love all Dave and Busters but this one. It supposed to be for adults but this one was like a Chucky Cheese. I won't be going again until they fix this."}
{"text":"Awesome place especially for kids , service slow but not bad ... draft beers r excellent, our server Orville was very sweet. Worth a visit . Dream place for kids who love to play games , parents can chill with their drinks & kids can play"}
{"text":"I went there for food a few weeks ago and the service was slow. It might have had to do with the fact I was there on a friday night and the place was packed. I have gone here for dinner in the middle of the week and the service was much better, though. As for the games, they're your traditional games to play. They're always fun... when you're drunk. lol!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this Dave and Buster's is classified as a Jillians Restaurant, but whatever.  Work conferences can be ok, but once the workday ends, what is there to do?  I couldn't go back home, obviously, so I went searching in my rental.  Luckily, across the street from the JW Marriott there was a Dave and Busters.  Ok, so I am used to the D&Bs in both Milpitas and San Diego.  I'm talking crowded, like you have yell at someone 1 foot away from you if you need to talk to them.  Crowded like if you show up after 6pm, the wait for a table at the restaurant is over an hour.  Crowded like you have to throw some elbows around to get a drink.  Oh yeah, and if you show up after 10pm, there is that silly $5 cover charge.  This is absolutely not the case at this D&B.  We got there on a Wednesday, so when we checked this place out the first night, I expected it to be empty, and it was.  Fine.  We went Thrusday night, a semi-party night, but again, it was pretty much empty.  Ok.  Friday night rolls around.  This is a party night in any big city, but AGAIN, not much of a crowd.  Saturday night had a slightly higher turnout, but still pretty much an open house.  Though it was a little disappointing at first, I came to realize this was a blessing in disguise.  I could walk in at any time, sit at a booth and get served right away.  If I needed credits for my card, I could walk up immediately to a machine and get it recharged.  If there were any games I wanted to play, no lines.  It truely was beautiful.  After flipping through their elaborate drink menu, I settled for \"The Shizzle.\"  Thank you Snoop Dogg for placing that suffix into everyday vocabulary.  Anyway, \"The Shizzle\" did taste great, so props for appropriate use of the word.  The one bad memory I had was that my stuffed animal got jacked while I was playing a basketball game.  I wanted to get something for my baby, so I must have pumped at least $10 into that crane/claw game.  Each time the claw decends, grips onto the prize, but then slips out of its grasps encouraged me to keep trying.  Addicting.  After my first one was jacked, I was determined to get another.  With an amazing twist of fate, I got three in one try, so after that I called it a night.  Oh yeah, and now that I think about it, I think we got ripped off because we always came at happy hour, but I think they charged us full price for drinks.  Just a tip, always ask for an itemized receipt."}
{"text":"Sometimes, it's easy to tell the merits of a place when you deal with their management and see how well they deal with simple requests, to make their machines more enjoyable for both casual customers and potential repeat visitors.  This D&B, all things considered, has not quite lived up to this.  At other arcades (whose names I won't mention...), if we tell management that there is an issue on a machine that could potentially cause injury, they send out a technician to assess the problem. Here, even a request like raising pads on a dance machine-- an easy adjustment that can be done without having to restart said machine, something that would enable players to more easily play without the risk of tripping on the metal-- was met with stiff opposition and excuses left & right.   I don't know if the management of this Dave & Buster's reads these reviews, but please look after your machines better. An insanely loyal and surprisingly affluent group of people who are willing to sink money into your machines even on quiet days have waited for this place to open, with expectations other arcades in Las Vegas have set. It's disappointing that, on the opening day, this location misses the mark."}
{"text":"Very unhappy!!! We drove over an hour and a half to Dave and Busters for the server to say that even tho the internet stated a promtion they will not honor it. We left very unhappy. They are not willing to honor what is stated. Donnot go there, they are looking to rip you off!!"}
{"text":"AWFUL. I do not write reviews but this place was so horrible I had to. Our waitress knew NOTHING about the menu. I asked her if she had lime.. She didn't know (even though the mixed drinks have them in it) she didn't know what cheeses they had for a burger and she didn't write in bacon for the burger. My boyfriend got the ribs fries and wing combo. He asked her for boneless wings instead of the normal ones and she said that the kitchen will do that only if they feel like it. What?!?! When our food came out, my burger was soggy, OVERCOOKED and looked like it came out of a microwave. His food was bland and had no meet on the ribs. She then never came back to check on us. Also the music was blaring which normally isn't a problem at all but each song was the most annoying one you can think of....one kept saying kill them with kindness and gangnam style seemed to be on repeat. If you're looking for mediocre food, crappy service and bussers throwing plates around, look no further!! Will never go back."}
{"text":"One word to describe Dave & Buster's? Fun. The arcade games are really fun, and the bar and restaurant is pretty cool. First, let's talk about the bar. The bar is pretty fun with lots of tv screens and friendly bartenders. The bar has good drinks, and I should say that you can take your drinks to the arcade! Now, let's talk about the restaurant. Since one of my family members had a birthday at the restaurant, I can do a good review. The food was great and yummy, and the service is okay. Finally, let's talk about the arcade. The arcade has a great number of games and good games. I believe now they have these fighting robots, but I don't think they work right now... Once your done playing, you cash in your tickets or save the tickets, to get a prize! Also for all the area is can get crowded, I recommend coming once it opens. It's located next to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars. It was a HORRIBLE experience. BEWARE OF TURKEY SUBSTITUTION CHARGE! $5.19 PER PATTY. My waitress did not share that charge with us. Not only did she not voice the fee she messed up the whole order. She caught an attitude when we tried discussing it with her."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best- overcooked food, thats fine-it happens.  Bathrooms were straight up gross.  Toilets leaking at bottom.  Odd holes in the stalls. Used hygiene products on floor.  Paper towels left on sink- no holder."}
{"text":"Worth the drive with the family,had a great server...thanks Jeff for taking care of our table & good looking out for food suggestions also"}
{"text":"I will say... the games can be a bit pricey during normal hours, but once you get that out of the way, it is a great place.   Let me specify something though that I feel is necessary, their bar staff... good God, if you don't experience anything of value in your life whether that be skydiving, climbing Mt. Everest, WHATEVER it may be... visit this place simply for the service from their bar staff! The two ladies we had tuesday night were not only wildly entertaining, but as attentive as can be without officially stepping the boundary of overbearing. It was perfect. Suggestive on items, thoughtful on preference, and for a place that had such a great selection I found that extremely valuable.   Please keep those bartenders with all your might and I will regularly frequent. Otherwise I might consider boycotting as if a victim of Stockholm syndrome. They were that good.   Games are fun too though. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a place I'd go to just for the games. The food was bad. I had the chicken sliders and there was two pieces of wood in the sandwich which I found in my mouth. Granted the manager did take off the price of the sliders but everyone's fries were lukewarm. My sister got the chicken fingers and wow, there was zero flavor or seasoning on it. The bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky. The waitress was nice but overall i wouldn't dine here again."}
{"text":"I've probably only been to 3 Dave & Buster's in my life, but this is probably my favorite one. It's a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other 2 I've been to, though they pretty much have the same games. The prizes are also better here, and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too. Definitely take advantage of the half priced games on Wednesdays!!!  I don't come for the food, since it's very average. With all these good restaurants close by, why don't just eat somewhere else and come for the games?"}
{"text":"Hi I have a lot to say about my traumatic experience at Dave and Busters, but i'm gonna go in a list   * Soggy potato chips  * wasn't given silver wear  *empty ketchup bottle was left on the table  *chicken wings tasted god awful  *there was a loud noise occurrence during my meal *was cursed by a young child at the table next to me  *they mistook beads for bugs  *the ketchup, that we had to get ourselves, was a confusing flavor *had to wait an hour to bowl and couldn't find the bowling desk *had to sell everything i owned to afford one appetizer   *two full mustards yet an empty ketchup bottle on our table  * the only show they played on their 40 tv's was sports   the only good thing about this place was they played a one direction music video :)"}
{"text":"I really only go for the games don't care so much for their food. It's a great hangout place to just hang around play games and have fun."}
{"text":"We checked in at 7:00 pm on a Saturday with a group of 19 for a birthday gathering.  We were originally told 9:00 pm is when we'd be seated, but that's not the problem, because we were able to play before being seated.  We ACTUALLY didn't get seated until 10:00 pm, only to be told the kitchen was taking 3 hours for people's orders.  Didn't see a manager until after 10:30 pm.  Needless to say, we didn't stay to eat and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't really come here for the food as I can find better food outside of the area but I love their gaming area! It's fun and will keep you occupied for hours :) different to other things u can do in Toronto since most places don't have arcade"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Dave and Busters in a while and I'm sure I will probably not visit any time soon.  I went with a group of people tonight, and it took forever for us to get service and once we did.  We ordered our food and I guess because they were bowling it's a rule that you have to pay for your food first.  I thought this was crazy and asked the waitress well what if I don't like the food or if something is wrong?  She looked at me and said then I'll try to fix it, I said ok and I got my food and it was burnt.  Just nasty, so they redid it and I guess it was a problem (I'm sure not wanting to be bothered) but they redid it and the second time around it was ok, but better than the first time.  The group I was with could only get one drink at a time, not sure what that was about but it was what it was.  Any who, not a fan so now I realize why I wasn't too much of one before."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of D&B's in California and always have a great time.  Granted Ive only been to this Tempe location once, but that one experience saw extremely poor service both with our waitress when we ate and at the bar getting drinks and it wasnt busy at all."}
{"text":"This place is big. There's bowling, pool, a restaurant with okay food, and games, most of which are played for tickets. There are three major knocks on this place in my opinion. First, it's really not that kid friendly, as it's open on two ends and there's nothin preventing someone from walking out with a kid. I always stress safety when we go but parents really need to stay in top of their kids, which can be difficult if you have more than one child.   Secondly, it lacks a food selection of traditional arcade games. Most games are extremely violent or involve tickets, neither of which are appropriate for kids of some ages.   On another note, the games that are played for tickets are really an introduction to gambling, i.e. pay money to play a game of chance in hopes of winning tickets or a prize. I always steer the young ones away from playing games solely in the hope of winning tickets. I stress hat they should play a game that will be fun regardless of whether it involves tickets.  In summation, true kids love the place but I'm not a big fan."}
{"text":"Got the fondue and loved it :). Also got nachos to go for my brother. Won some points for the night."}
{"text":"I recently stopped there with my girlfriend and her kids to celebrate her daughters 21's birthday. I ordered the fish and chips. Don't order the fish and chips unless you want to lube your insides for months. I know I probably got the one that got away and they refried it 3 times. The outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste. The fish itself was bland. After a few bites I called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise. He grabbed my plate and took it to his manager. But before doing so asked if I wanted something else I said no I had lost my appetite. The manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area. I was thinking he would have stopped but didn't oh well. The waiter took my meal it off the bill. I have eaten there before and the food was good. Sometime you just get one that isn't."}
{"text":"Great place, food is good, vanilla shakes are the bomb.  My kids favorite place to go"}
{"text":"Day or night    Someone really needs to keep up with the men's bathroom. You walk in and it smells like 50 dudes pissed on the walls"}
{"text":"Yeeh, where to begin... The atmosphere is great.  Adult without alienating kids, you won't find too much cheese in the decor.  The wait staff is less than helpful, the process of understanding the dizzying array of discount options, with and without food, is frustrating.  My poor vegetarian friends from out of town had nearly no food options, so we decided to get snacks. Taco Tuesday had no meatless options like beans. The drink menu has no prices, so we opted not to drink.  I feel like this place is crafted to part you from your money as unartfully as possible. The food was not bad, without being craveable, and I'm left thinking that the company just doesn't like its own customers."}
{"text":"I have a headache just thinking about this place, but can see why others would find it a fun night out. The food is sub-par bar food, but, let's be honest, it is just an afterthought to the fun and games which is understandable."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple a of times a few years ago, and I honestly remember it being much more fun. I came here with group of friends on a Friday night around 10pm and we decided to start with a few apps and drinks in the restaurant. Our server was provided us with the SLOWEST service I have ever experienced in my life. I saw other groups enter later, be fully served and paid their bills in the time it took us to order our apps. By the time we finally got our bills and went to fill up our power cards, it was 12:15am. The games overall were ok, nothing too exciting, but I did notice a good amount of the games were either out of service, or accepted your points and then simply did not work. I ended up losing a decent amount of tickets because of this.   Overall not too impressed"}
{"text":"Didn't get to play this game but I will definitely be back for it! Looks awesome! #shootemup #master  I also prefer the atmosphere and customer service at this location over the one on Desert Ridge.   My only complaint is that they need more airhockey machines!"}
{"text":"Came here for a kid's birthday party and the service was horrible.  None of the employees seem to know much, even the girl at the ticket register couldn't answer my questions - and none of them said, \"I don't know, let me ask my supervisor.\"  The bathrooms were disgusting - trash on the floor and extremely dirty and sticky floors.  The games are great but expect to pay a lot for credits.  Food is not bad but pricey for what it is,"}
{"text":"Ooh fun, a new D&B, lets give this a shot we thought...we were met at the door by a crowd of people we basically had to push through to get in, beause the line to get the power cards gathers right at the main entrance (one of the more brilliant layouts I would say)... We were so thirsty...went to the bar for a drink...nothing too complicated...a coke, a water, and decided, what the heck french fries sound like a good idea...so we stood at the bar...at least 8 empty seats...5 ppl behinf the bar so I would say not busy...no one ever bussed the dishes and glasses in front of us...but no biggie we would wander with our spoils and spend money on their games (their business model last I checked) so instead of spending the monies we waited 15 min (possibly more) for someone to even glance in our direction after repeatedly begging for service...so I order: coke, water and fries please..no prob he says, brings me water...then asks, now what did you want again...fries and a coke...ok I will put that in...20 minutes later, no fries...so I ask someone if he can find out about the fries...he calls something over the walkie then says, they are coming...I assume on a slow boat from France, or wherever it is French fries come from...because 15 min later, no fries...so I ask again and he says, \"did you already pay for them,\" what!? So I said yes, according to my receipt here I did 41 minutes ago...and he says, I'll get the manager. So manager comes over and says, \"what's wrong?\" I just looked at him...you know that look the the dog gives you when you ask them if they want more dog food while you eat steak...yeah, thats the look...I mumbled something about fries, and being abandoned by my frends who were bored of waiting and he said, \"did you already pay for them?\" So this took all of the remaining patience left in my french fryless body to simply say yes, and he said, \"would you like them to go?\" So now I am questioning, am I being thrown out for inappropriate ordering? Was asking for the water pushing it? So he brings us fries...not too long later...we eat the fries...and we head to play games...one of the brand new free games ...the screen was jumping and so screwed up that te husband was pretty disappointed, another stopped working right before we got to it...however while waiting, I watched a gentleman shatter his spirits into the ball holder of a particular game and leave glass and beer all over the machine...I spoke to one of their floor attendants who said...\"we see it all the time, people ignore the tables...ha ha ha...and we lose more mother boards that way.\" So I said I am concerned with the glass fragments in the machine where people put their hands, he said I am more concerned with the mother board. So kudos to you D&B for finding so many ways to tell a customer that you don't care at all about them."}
{"text":"Worst service ever . Came here once before and had the same experience . Was hesitant to give Dave and busters another chance but I did. Food seems like it's been waiting in the kitchen for hours , fries are always cold . First time here I waited over an hour to get food , second time order was incorrect and nothing was done to make up for their mistake . Terrible customer service . Will definitely not come back ."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing a Dave & Busters. Am I sheltered? Maybe. But mostly, I've avoided them because I simply don't like kids, so when I think of an arcade, potentially with screaming children running around, I break out in hives.   Recently a buddy of mine told me that they have a good happy hour and also a game special on Wednesdays so I figured I'd give them a shot.   We spent our time upstairs. This is where the arcade and billiards room is located. You'll know this before even reaching the top of the stairway. There are the deafening sounds of BEEP! BOOP! BEEP BEEP! BOOP! Then as you reach the top... all the flashing lights.  It reminded me of a casino without smoke and with slightly less despair. Any despair that existed, however came from the employees, not so much the patrons. There was about a 50/50 ratio of employees that seemed to completely hate their job, and wanted nothing more than to set the place ablaze. Then the other half who at least attempted to be pleasant. So I would say the quality of hospitality you receive will be a coin flip.   Back to the Wednesday Special... it's pretty good. The games and even billiards are 1/2 price all day. And I'll give them props on the billiards room, it was nice.   The Happy Hour was from 4:30-7pm and included  1/2 priced cocktails. I'm more of a beer guy but their beer selection is mediocre at best. Instead I opted for a Key Lime Coconut Margarita. Yeah... I said it. Should I be ashamed? Maybe a little. But it was delicious and honestly an adorable cocktail... I wish I took a pic. I'll take a pic next time.   For dinner I got the Philly Cheesesteak. I didn't hate it. The entrée also included a $10 game card which was cool. There are actually a list of different $16.99 entrees that include the $10 game card. It's a pretty good deal.  I want to add that our server Leah was one of the cool employees. If a manager reads this... she's a keeper. She was on top of her game all night.   The final verdict is that D&B is what it is. I like it. I don't love it, but a good time can certainly be had. I'll probably be back for some more Happy Hour Key Lime Coconut Margs... no shame. Ok... Maybe a little."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this was by far the worse experience i've had at a Dave and Busters location for dining that is.   When we arrived i could tell it was really busy. 7pm, Friday night...packed, packed, packed.  It was just my husband, my 3 yr. old daughter and I tonight. We had decided on enjoying dinner first then tackling the games. I got to the podium and there were 3 hostess's present. None of the 3 were friendly, smiling or looked happy to even be there which already gave off a bad impression right off the bat. I asked for a table for 3 and to my surprise we were sat right away. No wait! Score! She placed our menus down and walked away no \"Your server yadda yadda will be right with you\" no \"How's everyone doing tonight?\" You know, no small talk whatsoever... thumbs down  We sat at our table for about 3-4 minutes before the server stopped and greeted us.thumbs down  (In the restaurant business that is unacceptable, you should be greeting your table within  60 seconds or less. I know because i've been serving for more than 10 years in various restaurants ) she finally stops by after the 3-4 minutes of sitting there and says \"i'll be right with you\" im thinking at this point i would've at least got the drinks in or at least some water. But thats just me. Thumbs down  She lets another 2 minutes go by and comes to ask if we're ready to order. No small talk from her either, no suggestions from the menu, didnt ask if we had eaten there before, if we were first timers. These are the kind of things you wanna conversate with your guests to get that tip average up!  thumbs down  At this point my 3 year is already hungry so i put in her kids meal (does not come with a drink, it's an extra cost) and order my husband and I some water because we are still deciding on what to eat.  For people who dine here often the menu is very vast, alot to choose from so it takes a minute to go over it. We havent dined in awhile so we were checking out the new items, drinks, etc. Now we are ready to order within in that time period that she brings the waters, its been almost 10 minutes! 10 minutes! I was irritated at this point. I finally got up and walked over to another server who was at the machine and said if she could get our server because we were wanting to order. She comes out 2 minutes later. It took us an entire close to 20 minutes to get drinks and our dinner order in. Ridiculous! We are starving at this point.  A food runner brings my daughters food out and i noticed there was ranch, i asked if they had different options which i then asked for honey mustard, he said he would be back but never came.   Our food took another 15 minutes to come out and she took 2 minutes to come over to make sure that our food was correct or cooked appropriately. Which my burger was wrong i asked for onion rings instead of fries. Im already hungry at this point but wanted to eat already, instead she leave the fries in the mean time she takes it off my plate while she gets the rings which took another 2 minutes. I'm beyond frustrated. We hurry and eat so we can play games. She didnt ask if we wanted to load our cards or anything. I'm sure that helps with the sales.  All in all its pretty large with lots of variety of games and the food was tasty. Service and the employees is what sucked. I hope they work on it. For it being a really busy location with it being the only one in Vegas, they better step there game up. 2 thumbs down overall for dining experience"}
{"text":"Went here last week, always a great time playing games. The food it decent and beer prices aren't bad either.  Would recommend to anyone trying to have fun in Az indoors"}
{"text":"Service was horrid. On a Sunday morning with the place empty it took 15 minutes to get service. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the manager and yet we waited 30 minutes for our bill. Likely will NOT be back!! Terrible!"}
{"text":"Arcade prizes are nicer then some places and the games seemed to all be in good working order which for a lot of arcades is a saying something. That being said food-wise I was massively underwhelmed. The appetizers our party ordered were bland and looked like they were freezer snacks (definitely not worth the price). As for my main meal I went with the chili dog which was great the last time I checked in but this time was over done, dry, cold, and had way too much onion. I guess it all kind of comes with the territory but still...On top of that the wait just to get to our table was estimated to be 10 min but took over 40 min. At least our waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner tonight. Never again. Took 5 minutes for a server to speak with us, and she had to ask if we already had a server...  Brought our water then showed up 10 minutes later, meanwhile the guests seated across from us whom came in 5 minutes after us, got their food 5 minutes before us.  Our food had obviously sat under a heating lamp for a good 10 minutes, my steak was dry and my wife's chicken resembled shoe leather. This place has certainly gone down hill over the years.   We used to go to D&B at least 3-4 times a week for 3 years when they first opened. It's a shame what has happened to them."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place during my university days but have since grown out of it.  First off, this place is huge..they have two bars, a dining area, billiards, golf screens, comedy shows, arcade games, large-screen entertainment for any major sports event or UFC fight and much more.  I used to come here mainly for the eat and play (back when it was $15.99... it is now $17.99+?)..the food here is alright, normal bar food...but the service is just horrible. It is nearly impossible to flag down a server at the dining area inside the arcade.   The games are fun but can get quite pricey.. Make sure to sign up for their emails to get coupons! They have half price all games on Wednesdays.   The prizes for the games that dispense tickets have gone downhill over the years but a great place to go on a date and win some cute souvenirs. Overall, D&B is still a great place to get together with friends and family for drinks and games!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I recently came here for a surprise welcoming dinner. Maybe it was our bad for not making a reservation earlier but there was seven people in our party and we waited about 45 mins before getting a table. They seemed to be busy but not that slammed to not be able to seat us, but at least we got to enjoy some drinks at the bar beforehand.   Drink wise this place rocks. They have happy hour 4-7 with half off all cocktails and bud lights for $2. I tried the watermelon margarita and mango margarita. I liked the styling and playfulness of the watermelon one, but the mango tasted much better in my opinion. Can't beat the prices of around $5 per drink though.  Now for food, my bae and I decided to share the sliders and wings app. I honestly was not impressed at all with this. The wings tasted frozen and the sliders were pretty bland. Definitely a disappointment.   Overall I think D&B is great for drinks and games, but not so much the food. I'd be back again, but only for late night shenanigans."}
{"text":"I love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often.  The place is usually pretty clean.  Pool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you'll find in the city.  Food is just \"ok\" Drink prices are fair but not great."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the restaurant. It took forever to have someone take our order. Then they didn't come back to refill the drinks we asked for until it was too late. Waited way too long to get our check. They don't seem to have a very good system."}
{"text":"Love this Dave & Busters. Connor the waitress is the BOMB. She's so polite and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much an occasional guilty pleasure for me. I have a deep affection for what my mother-in-law calls \"the honkey tonk\" and D&B fits the bill with its Skee Ball, cheesy coin games, and vintage video games. The only aspect missing is pinball. I like coming here on off days and times, and I can't vouch for the food. I only go for beer and games, but it scratches the itch every time."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorie place in arizona. Love to drink and play at the same time. I will difently recommend this place to my friends"}
{"text":"We had to switch my sons birthday dinner here last minute and it turned out great! They were really accommodating. Our server was great, the food was perfect for our party, and the games were a good price. The prize options were pretty descent also. The staff was super friendly. My son had a great birthday. My family was planning our next trip back as we were leaving. :)"}
{"text":"This place is a gamer's heaven! The games here are larger than any versions of it. The bar is separate from the games so kids can come as long as they have adult supervision and cannot sit at the bar. This place has lots of great deals so check out the place soon before it gets crowded!"}
{"text":"This was fun. I took my BF son's to kill some time during Christmas break. The guy at the desk was so helpful and helping me decide which package to choose. We played several games, some new, some old, some classic. It was a great time and it helps that it is attached to the mall!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and ended up having fun for the arcade part even thought it was busy. For the restaurant, the food was subpar. I didn't expect much but the Mac and cheese tasted like it was heated frozen food. All of our food came out cold and it took the kitchen an hour to serve us. No apologies from the manager and the poor waitress had to deal with tables of hungry customers who waited an hour for bad food. Wouldn't come back to eat here."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. It's a very simple concept: eat and play. Where else in the Summerlin area can you shop, eat, drink, watch sports and have the kids play games? If you think it's expensive, go to Disneyland. If you want to drink yourself into a coma, go to a bar.   Every time we come here, they greet us with a smile and open the door for us. JD walked us through the place and created our Power Card. He told us about promotions and specials. Employees like JD are the reason why this place will succeed.   We went to eat and Marco was our server. He was professional and attentive. The food is good and the ambience is great. It's also very clean. I understand it's not fine dining but if other Yelpers want to cry about the food, there are a dozen other places in the area. Another reviewer said the place was too loud? Are you retarded? It's an arcade. Go to the library if you want peace and quiet.   I highly recommend Dave & Buster's to anyone who wants to have fun and eat good food."}
{"text":"Just like any other Dave and busters I've been to, there is a wide selection of games to choose from and drinks as well.  The service was quick for us which is nice. The area is very friendly and I have seen plenty of kids here which is a good thing since some Dave and busters I've been to aren't so kid friendly with the amount of drunk people roaming around."}
{"text":"The games here are on the 2nd floor while the restaurant is at ground level. This location has all your standard arcade games, as well as skeeball, basketball throwing games, and air hockey. Some of the arcade games we tried were malfunctioning, although they didn't mind taking our credits!"}
{"text":"Food, drink, and gaming, what a perfect combo! We've been here a few times, mainly to run around and pretend like you're a kid again at the arcade. There are a plethora of games to choose from, whether you like games of chance, shooting games, or racing games, chances are there's something for you. There's even a cute \"If they made it\" similator, which will show you what your future kid will look like based on you and your date's profiles (Sadly, based on our results, maybe adoption would be best haha).   I've been to several Dave and Buster's locations, and this one is decent. One thing I've noted is that over the years, at least for my tastes, the prizes don't seem as nice now."}
{"text":"Yesterday my group at work had a team building lunch followed by a competitive round of games. We were a group of about 20 with prior reservations and they had a separate room awaiting our arrival. There was one main waitress who was assisted by a couple of others when the food was served.  If I didn't look around at my dining companions, I wouldn't have felt like I was in a large group. The drinks were brought out quickly and promptly filled. When the food was brought out, the orders were correct, the temperature was excellent and it didn't take long to serve everyone.   I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was a good sized portion, good flavor and an all around descent meal for the price.  I would definitely order it again.  While we were eating the store manager came out and gave us a background on the company's history, the business model, how it has adjusted to the recession and described the length of time and number of staff it requires to open a new location. The newer models are smaller and require less time and resources to open - 45 days and a new store can be ready to go. This location is approximately 53,000 sq feet, while there are smaller ones around 15,000 sq feet.   After lunch, we broke up into teams and played 5 different games in a head to head format. Everyone had a good time and enjoyed not only the dining, but the gaming experience. I have been to the location in Atlanta and this was just as fun.  It was an excellent team builder and gave me the opportunity to check out this location. Bravo to the bosses for picking this place."}
{"text":"Try their happy hour food and drinks coz it was awesome.  Had the spinach dip , wings , and quesadilla. We ordered some cocktails and beer on tap. Overall the food and place was great. Our server was also awesome and will definitely come back next time with the kids for some arcade games."}
{"text":"A few tips: -Coupons are a must! Either sign up for their emails or go to the main office located near paradise bakery on the back end of the building facing the parking lot. You can almost always find coupons for D and B and other places at Desert Ridge. Like match plays for 10 and 20 dollars. Doubling your money and playtime.  -Supercharge your card getting 25 percent more -The food is a bit better than okay, I would use tickets to buy food and eat downstairs where you can watch some sports and get away from the loud noise and lights. The food costs 750 and 1000 tickets per item; items include cheese sticks, spinach dip, nachos, and desserts.  So for around $26 you can have about an hour of play and your kid can get a cheap toy and then turn those tickets in for a meal. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such low reviews. It's Dave and Buster's. They have games, and they have average food with lots of choices. They have a pretty good happy hour, and it can get crazy on the weekends. It's also a good place to watch the game, fight, or match of your choice."}
{"text":"Alright, best way to describe Dave & Busters is that this a Chuck E Cheese for bigger kids and adults.  In other words a cash burning machine.  Usually when we go we just come for the games when we are near by IKEA.  This is a huge all in one American complex that houses a restaurant, a sports bar, pool hall and of course the arcade section.  We've been to various ones in the States and its pretty consistent with those ones.  Normally we don't get the food and only buy tokens for the arcade.  But today we had Xmas dinner (Yes, you heard me, Xmas dinner, it wasn't my call so don't judge me!) so can comment about the food.  It's basically pub/chain food with burgers, pasta and the like and overall not really good.  The steaks were dry, ribs a little hard but the burgers were okay.  The only redeeming feature is that they have arcade combos for about $20 that includes the meal and $10 worth of tokens.  But the real value is if you add $5 you get unlimited arcade (non ticket dispensing games) for the entire day!  The arcade itself is very good and there's a ton of TVs for sports games.    At the end of the day I would say the food is 2 and the venue 4 so in total 3/5 overall.   Just not my first choice for Xmas dinner:)"}
{"text":"Granted it was busy but getting seated took 45 minutes,  not the 20-30 we were told and getting food was an equally lengthy process."}
{"text":"Games are always fun, but the food here at this location was a total and complete let down. How is this a mountain of nachos?"}
{"text":"It's pretty rare that I drop a review down a star, especially when my first review was 2 stars.  The service, food, and game are awful and overpriced here.  I spent about $50 for an awful experience.   My entree was suppose to come with fries but never did. When I asked, they said they would get them. 45 mins later, no fries. I never got them."}
{"text":"I recently went to D&B with a group of friends for the UFC fight. I have been to D&B 5-7 times previous but my friends had never experienced it. The new additions of BIG screen TV's was just the ticket to get them to go.    We were seated on the opposite side of the main dining room, in front of the large projection TV.  The place looks great, and for a sports fan it looks like an amazing place to spend a Football Sunday. Our problem came down to service...   It took a while after we had sat to find a waiter, I personally flagged one down. We all ordered a round of beer. A short time later we decided to get a Beer tube as it is the most cost efficient way to drink (even though you must put up your credit card for a $100 deposit)  NOTE: there seems to be a lack of supply of these beer tubes, and we were not told this. We had to wait 45 mins for our Beer tube to arrive.... 5 guys with no beer, thirsty watching UFC for 45 mins is bad news... I also asked if this was a busy night and was told it was alot quiter than the boxing fight a week before.   We were quick to poor the 100oz of beer tube into our 5 glasses. And then proceeded to order another round 10 mins later. This time we got draft beers as we did not want to wait another hour for a drink.  Our waiter came back and explained he can not serve us, as we just ordered a beer tube and it is their policy to slow people down after they order so much alcohol. We were quite shocked as this was only our 2nd drink each, we had a DD to drive us home and we are pretty big guys and can handle two beer each. We ended up waiting 15 mins and we were then served another beer.   I would also add that we did have food, few of us had the burger slider and wing platter. It was good, nothing special, and a little plain but good value. Another group had the Nachos and were quite disappointed, they had to even ask for salsa which I thought should be a given to go with nachos.   At the end of the night, we were VERY disappointed with the lack of service, and the food was nothing to rave about.   The only reason this review is a 2 star instead of a 1 is because the manager came over to all the tables in our area to comp them in some way either a free desert or a games card."}
{"text":"The food is actually quite delicious and much better than expected. The arcades are alright. But not to sound sexist, the three make workers we encountered were great. The two females ones were rude, and TERRIBLE at their job. Its like they didn't even know where they were or what was going on. One actually had the nerve to be texting and ignoring us while we tried getting her attention. The other couldn't answer any of our questions and they were very simple questions that even the security knew the answers to. Absolutely pathetic employees."}
{"text":"Just come for the arcades and beer. Food was very much unappetizing. Looks great on the photos in the menu and that is all it is. Had the caveman combo, ribs was over sauced but as I suspected it was to cover the fact that they was over cooked this dried out! Slider was slider with soggy buns due to the wet pickles being placed on top. The \"golden fingers\"way less than golden more like pale, dry and flavorless. Last but not least the coronarita, I was thoroughly unimpressed. Too much ice, told it was made with patron tequila and did not taste a drop of that. So stick with arcades and beer and you may have an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Went here on New Year's Day and waited on a table for about 20 minutes. We were immediately greeted by our server, I believe her name was Stephanie. I liked her from the start because she was an obvious Steeler fan. Me and my friends had never been here before. She explained what they called eat and play combo. We all had the X-rated mojito which was fabulous.all in all we had an excellent experience. We never had to ask for anything because Stephanie was two steps ahead of us. If you ever want to go to Dave and busters ask for Stephany she's the Steeler fan LOL"}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 and we were able to seat ourselves and our waiter Jake was very patient and attentive.   The food was good.  No one had any complaints.  No mess ups on orders (this day was a good day).  The kids enjoyed the video games.  Everyone had fun!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place. ...this is the 2nd time i went both times the foods service was awful. ...we waited 30 minutes for someone to take our drink orders....45 minutes for our food to show up when we got it ...our food was cold and gross ....we had no silverware when we asked for some it took 10 minutes to get it so our food just sat there. ....when we complained to the waitress she said oh ok well just let me know if you need anything else. ..she never came back. ..we paid our bill and went to the game room. ..we have decided that we will eat some where else from now on and then go to do the games only ....what a horrible experience and the workers didn't even care about us..."}
{"text":"They can do better with their vegetarian options. Catch up to the times.  Another point is the staff is majority black but the management is all white. Literally and they cater to the white guests to comfort them more than the minority guests."}
{"text":"So, I saw all the reviews and was afraid going there with my son, But eventually came. Ecauae it's the closest arcade to my house.  Played with my son for about an hour and the second he let Pennie \"employee\" tell him how many credits he has, he lost his card, shit.... He already picked his aqua man car and little piggie for his baby sister but the card with 1,350 credits was lost. I lost hope and a perfect day was about to turn to an educational experience on responsibility.... I said I'll try my chances at the front desk, maybe they could recover my card. Skeptic but optimistic.... The manager came in a sec started to help me, then Pennie came looking for us, she found the card!!!!! My hero!!!!! Amazing customer care, clean, nice music, a bit expensive.  U guys are amazing for sure will come again"}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us went here last night to celebrate my birthday.  Contrary to some reviews mentioning young kids, the crowd while we were there (8pm-12 on a Wednesday) seemed to be just 21+.  We discovered an issue with the skee-ball games and alerted the gift shop attendant; he came over within 5 minutes and fixed the machines and gave each of us a free play.  I was impressed. D&B has a good mix of games-- FPS, trivia, wheel of fortune, sports, glorified iPad games, and arcade classics.  Sadly there is no \"whack a mole.\"  We looked.  I was surprised by the value, albeit on a Wednesday when games are half off.  Two of us shared a card loaded with $12 (supercharged $10) and it lasted us almost 4 hours, playing games constantly.  We won something like 2000 tickets in that time, although we were going for entertainment value rather than tickets.  Drinks--we were there for happy hour (starts at 9 pm), and cocktails were half off (about $3-$4 after discount).  We tried the mojitos, white sangria, and green apple martini.  The first two were really sweet (although my friends like them), but the martini was a nice balance of sweet and sour.  I will definitely be returning, although I will probably stick to later at night to avoid the kids mentioned by other reviewers."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday for a date, and let me just say: it is perfect for date night! Eat, Play, Drink, they got it all.   I arrived a bit after 6PM and there was a very short line up at the front. This was mainly due to security IDing people up front. I then purchased a 4 Player pack with my partner and two peers. $35 for 250 chips each person. We were given a card with the chips inside.   We then walked over to the host table in the dining hall, but they had just seated their last table before us (the two peers with us). My partner and I could either wait 15 minutes, or sit at the bar and someone would come serve us. We opted for the bar. We sat down at a two-seater high table and I immediately noticed I didn't have a spot to put my purse (like a hook underneath high tables at other reataurants). This was a bit of a bummer.   It took a couple minutes before we were greeted (fair, not many people were at the bar). Our server was named Adam and asked if we needed anything. I got the alcoholic Original Snowcone, and Teriyaki Sirloin Steak. It took a bit before my food arrived, so I went to the washroom, which wasn't exactly nice. It didn't meet the quality of the rest of D&B. When I returned to my table, my food was warm. It came while I was away! Tragic. I took a sip of my Original Snowcone and it had more of an artificial coconut taste than I would have liked....it was drinkable, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My teriyako sirloin steak looked a bit small at first, about 5 thin strips of steak. Why are you $20.99? And then I found out. The steak itself, while a small portion, was well seasoned and juicy. The caramelized onion was my favourite part of this dish. I don't even like onions! It was sooo tasty. And then the mashed potatoes helped fill me up. I wasn't super full when I finished, but I was definitely satisfied. I paid for my partner too. Our bill came up to a bit over $50 after taxes, and before tip. Adam was pretty attentive in the beginning, but it was hard flagging him down for the bill as it started getting busier. Pretty good service overall.  The gaming: super fun and good teamwork building skills. Would definitely come again. They have games to get you sweating (table hockey), and games that help bring your heart rate back down (Guitar Hero). One game charged me 11.3 chips and didn't even work...it was that wheel multiplier game. I complained to one of the staff members and he offered me a free round of whatever game of my choosing. I think this was a bit unfair - the equivalent amount of chips should be used instead in my opinion. I played Mario Kart, which was only 5-6 chips, so I lost out to 5+ chips.  I got hungry 2 hours into gaming and had to take a break at the bar for a drink. In the end, after 2 hours, I still had 96 chips left! I ended up giving my card to the other two friends who already ended up using all their chips.  Overall, a very fun experience with games and good food!"}
{"text":"To say that my experience at this D&B was a disappointment is an understatement. Let me start off by saying that it was my boyfriend's 21st birthday, so we came with a party of about 10 people. We got there a bit late (9:45), but I had intended on eating and then playing games for about an hour. Well, let me tell you, that did not happen. Our server was very rude and treated my boyfriend as a child. I had to flag him down just to order some food, and above all, we sat there until closing time because of such slow service. Around 11pm, we had asked for our check multiple times, since we only had about an hour to play games, but our server was only interested in talking about his car to the guys (which is fine, however, in this case it interfered with his ability to do his job). By the time the tab was paid, it was already 11:45, so of course, we left. I was also pretty pissed about the fact that our server did not bother to even apologize for taking up all of our time. If I had wanted to just eat dinner, there are many other places I would have went to instead. I expected a lot better, especially considering that it was my boyfriend's special day. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here for trivia night on Thursday and ordered one of the \"Glow Cones\" alcoholic drink. It was supposed to come with a cube light in the drink, but after it was already made they told the lovely server they ran out. I only ordered the drink for the glow part. (Wow factor) makes sense. So the server went and asked his manager to comp the drink and so the cheap manager, Omar just took off the price of the light ($2) :-/ Again, I only ordered the drink for the light! Unhappy to say the least. The rest of the order with the drinks and food was fine I was just baffled that they couldn't just comp the drink. :("}
{"text":"Worst food ever.  We had our food 52 mins. after we ordered.  Our server was nice but I prefer to eat in a gas station than here...  Next time I will listen to my friends when they give me an advice."}
{"text":"I normally love Dave and Busters but this location seemed to be very rude. I had a bad experience coming here a few days ago. The staff was friendly when they could be found but it seemed like no one was around the majority of the time. The bar was open but sat empty for ages at a time. The servers also seemed like they were taking forever to get back to you.   The food was ok. A bit mushy and stale as far as fried foods go. The bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"i had 1 merlot and cheri the manager i was not aloud another drink . really .   we ordered  a couple of burgers really we will not be back service was terrible  Ch erey sucked"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I absolutely love Dave & Busters for its wide selection of games! However, what's truly lacking in this fairly new establishment is the lack of quality customer service. I understand that it's only been open since Monday, but for the sake of this franchise, I hope that this particular location will learn how to adapt and treat customers as they want to be treated in the near future.   This 2 star review is specifically targeted to the dine in restaurant located within the establishment.   At 9:15pm (Wednesday 8/10/16) my group had put our name down and was quoted 30 minutes to be seated. Although this seemed to good to be true, we took the hostess' word for it, only to not be seated for another hour later. Our server \"Daisy\" took care of our party smoothly for the most part, but we were turned off by the offensive remark that she had made regarding 3 of my Asian friends at the table. When returning our IDs to the table, she had stated that she couldn't tell the difference between them even though these 3 individuals remotely do not look the same at all!   The treatment that we had received towards the end of our meal and closing takes the cake. A tall gentleman who we had never seen before in a headset approaches us and I quote tells us, \"Hey everyone, I know you're having a good time and all, but we need you all to leave because we are closing.\" When the gentleman approached us, we were still waiting on our credit cards and finishing up the rest of our drinks. Excuse me? This isn't common courtesy at all... This is not how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant.   Thanks Dave & Busters for the games, but please learn to get it together at the restaurant part and learn how to treat customers nicely and with respect."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and prompt. I mean, we enjoy sitting at the bar when we eat out, so if you get bad service at the bar, there is a problem. This was not the case so thank you!! I ordered my picky way of butchering anything salad. I was surprised but in a great way!! I ordered the Asian chicken salad. I must have not really read the menu, just looked at pics, had no idea shaved brussel sprouts, broccoli slaw and a ton of other shaved veggies would be present...score!! The chicken was chicken,nothing special, its alright though, the dressing was good. I asked for a side of salsa, not a Mexican restaurant so being brought out a side of Pace is acceptable.   The burger my boyfriend ordered was some sort of crazy contraption consisting of fried buffalo chicken, blue cheese, a burger and some other stuff, thing was HUGENORMOUS!and it came with TOTS!!! and they were good!  All in all the food was good/average, it is not a big restaurant, it is a big game place for grown ups so all was acceptable and as expected. We enjoyed our time here eating, drinking and playing games and although probably not something to do all the time, we will be back :)  P.S, I got this margarita corona thing...I liked it :)"}
{"text":"The arcade games are old , The staff seems exhausted, some of the arcades are not even functioning well enough. It seems like this place is just about to get closed unless kids attend because of their parents force them to do. Plus, the ticket store is ridiculously over priced for the stuff they give. I mean, come on guys you can/should do better !"}
{"text":"It's loud and fun.  Being able to shoot zombies on a large screen and sip a beer at the same time makes for good times in my book."}
{"text":"Jam packed on a Friday night. A true indication that building a D&B in Pineville was a smart move! There were just two of us and we just wanted to sit at the bar and have an adult beverage and possibly grab some bar food.  We were able to slide into the bar area and find a couple open seats. Even though we were greeted immediately it took some time before the bar tender was freed up enough to where she could take our drink orders. They have cold beer on draft and some local offerings, but nothing too extravagant or crafty. (At this point in time they had Sugar Creek and OMB.)  After flapping our gums and catching up as old friends do, we finally put in a food order. The bar tender was gracious and respected our time to chat and then decide on order. My friend ordered the basic cheeseburger and I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, which sounded amazing and must've been because she quickly reappeared stating they just ran out of the lettuce wraps. Dagnabit. I opted for the buffalo boneless chicken wings and french fries. His burger looked delicious! Should've went that route, I wasn't overly excited about my order. It filled the stomach but did not WOW me...  The bar tabs were now paid and off we went to check out the arcade area... where all the little kids and big \"little\" kids spend way too much money. But, man, is it fun! They did a good job with mirror trickery, making your eyes assume the arcade appears much larger than it actually is, but they still managed to cram in game after game. That is good and bad, because is there is a large group hovering around one game it may be hard for you (and possibly your group) to enjoy your specific game.  I was introduced to this brand in 1999 and have visited locations in Illinois, North Carolina and Florida. We'll see how they keep up with things here or let it slide like other D&B spots."}
{"text":"Love this place! My friend wasn't able to make it out of town for the 4th, so to cheer him up I took him out for a night of fun. D&B was our second stop; we spent most of our time here because it's awesome!!!! Who doesn't like to kick back, have a few drinks then get crazy playing video games? There are enough games that everyone is pretty spread out and you only have to wait for a game if you really want to play it and someone just started playing. Most of the time if you are waiting to play, people play once then let other people go and keep rotating. It's nice to be in such a cool atmosphere, with music, drinks and video games. It's never too packed when I have gone and the food, service and drinks are affordable and good! It's a nice place to go to have a good time without having to go to multiple places and you are able to beat the hear. Everything you really need is in this one place! One tip, keep your players card, because you can reuse it if you don't use all your credits or your tickets!! Save them for next time! :)  Had a great night! Thanks D&B!"}
{"text":"We recently had a terrible experience there. We found a spot at the bar to wait the hour we were told it would take to get a table. After 20 minutes of me holding a $20 bill up we got asked if I wanted a drink. Many times the bartenders looked over at Imus, but never came over. Unacceptable. We finally got to our table and were ready to order. It took 15 minutes for the waiter to come back to take our order. When the food finally arrived all of our food was cold.  My steak was wrong and not good. My advice is go somewhere else. Madison has plenty of restaurants that have good service and hot food."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is ok. We came on a weekday and decided to eat and then go play games. They weren't busy at all in the dining area-maybe 4 tables total. Service was super slow. I came with a party of 4 and it took an hour to get our food. Three of us got our food and the 4th person didn't. The food runner told us that his food was coming soon. Fast forward 10 mins later and he gets his burger but it's ice cold. I get an appetizer with wings, loaded tots and mozzarella sticks. The wings were lukewarm. The tots were not loaded. The cheese on it was dry. My sticks were were not fully cooked. My husband got the quesadilla and he didn't mind it. My friend got the nachos and her nachos were cold and soggy. Overall, we were not impressed. The server came around and we told her our issues. She said two parties of 40 people just left and that the kitchen is still trying to catch up. Manager came around and we told him what was going on, he agreed about how sad food and asked to remake it for us. Two of us agreed and one declined only because we waited so long. My recommendation is to not eat here! Just play games. The games are fun and we were there for a while."}
{"text":"Food took forever. Bathrooms were disgusting, one of the most disgusting bathrooms I've ever been in, to be honest. Half were filled with paper and human waste, the other half were covered in pee. There was even a trash can in one of the toilets. Probably half of the games were either broken or didn't work properly if they did work at all. Our first time at a Dave and Buster's and I doubt we'll ever be back to one."}
{"text":"We came mid-day on a Saturday and were pleasantly surprised that the place wasn't overly crowded!  The machines are well maintained and the overall cleanliness of this location is very good.  In general the cost per game is ridiculous and of course the number of tickets required for even the cheesiest of prices is outlandish, but you know that going in."}
{"text":"I went back recently and I'm very happy to write that every machine was in working order and they're stilling bringing in new games to play.  I believe they do phase out some older games but nothing noteworthy was gone when I went.  I also noticed that the arcade area was a lot cleaner than during my previous visits, when I went in the middle of the day, so bravo on that front too.  Keep it up Dave & Buster's."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dave and Busters location I have been to and I feel terrible that I recommended my friend and I to eat here. We waited over 30 min for appetizers that arrived cold. Our server never checked in on us once,  no drink refills. Other people around got up and left because there was no server to take even their drink order for over 10 mins. On top of that,  we ordered the play and eat. The card the server gave us was for another location store and was not valid. Complained to a manager. He did nothing.  Complaint was elevated and really no resolution other then an apology. Will never ever come back to this location."}
{"text":"During my 25 minute wait to receive drinks we ordered I needed to use the restroom. I walked into the nearby bathroom and was horrified. Every toilet was filled to the brim with urine, feces and toilet paper. It looked like a public restroom at a bus stop that hadn't been cleaned for a month. After losing my appetite but still needing to pee I found an employee and politely explained to her the disaster in the restroom she obviously couldn't care less but told me where i could find the second feces and urine flooded restroom. Thankfully that one had one working stall and I was able to peacefully return to my table to continue waiting for my over priced, small portioned, micro wave quality meal."}
{"text":"If you are here to just play games, then its a great deal of fun, and is also a fantastic place to catch a sporting event.   If you are here to eat, maybe try somewhere else. I have tried eating here on several occasions and find that it is for the most part terrible. Nothing tastes like it is fresh at all. I would guess everything is delivered frozen and then either deep fried or heated in a microwave. I can't think of any meal I've ever finished here either from being bland or just plain lousy. Even my 11 year old, who loves wings and chicken fingers (2 staples here) thinks the food is terrible and refuses to eat here, even though he loves to play the games.   My advice, eat somewhere else then head here to play."}
{"text":"My employer had their company Christmas party here this past Friday.  Let's start with the only downside to having the party here, the food.  While it is hard to complain about free food, I will.  It was a buffet with nothing good going for it.  Enough said,    The rest of the experience was excellent.  We bowled and it was so fun (and funny) at times.  And we were each provided with game cards so I was able to drive race cars and pretend shoot things, awsome.   I won a bunch of tickets on other games and caught a stuffed bear in a claw game.    Everyone seemed to have fun.   Now I do believe that there are some people who believe themselves to be too old to enjoy video games and bowling, but not me or my coworkers.  We all had a blast.    So you have to let out your inner child to fully enjoy this type of venue.  I have no idea how much money I would have spent had it not been covered by my employer.    I imagine it would have been about $50 plus with all that was included.    Nice, clean place to play some games."}
{"text":"Charles, the bar manager was seriously amazing!  Totally catered  to my injured Vet and made our visit so much more enjoyable!  Even during a busy fight night (Go McGregor!) He had us covered! ! The staff was so accommodating and pleasant!   Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Host says 45 min wait. We ask if we can go around shop a little. She says be sure to come back in 30 min in case we are called earlier. So we come back in 25 minutes just to be safe only to be told we were put at the bottom of the list since they've already called us and we did not respond. SMH! When people are hungry 20 minutes and 45 minutes make a huge difference!  This girl need to go back to first grade and be taught how to tell time."}
{"text":"I have frequented this D&B many times over the last 5 years but hadn't been for almost a year now and I have to say I think things have gone downhill since last time I've been there.    First I noticed a major renovation took place to the dinning room and pool area since the last time I had visited.  I'm not impressed.  They previously had warm setting with wood and auburn colours, a cool overhead fan conveybelt system that was so unique and charming and hanging stained glass lamps.  Those have all been removed for cold blue colour scheme and industrial feel with large ductwork.  The service and food quality were terrible.  We waited 35minutes for a table of four in the dinning room.  The dinning room however was not full capacity, there were many empty tables.  Once we were seated it took another hour before we received our food.  We ordered appetizers soup and salad and they came out only two minutes before our entree.  It makes not sense we had to wait an hour for soup and salad appetizers.  We were dinning with another couple and his entree was entered incorrectly by the waitress so the wrong meal came out for him.  The waitress put a rush on his order and it still took another 30 minutes to arrive we had all finished our meals when he finally received his.  He was offered no compensation for the mistake.    The quality of the food was also not as good as it had been in the past.  With the exception of the broccoli cheddar soup that was actually amazing.  Though the mac and cheese which I had ordered many times was now a smaller portion less bacon and less saucy than before.  I was very disappointed in the midway also.  There is always they odd game out of order but there were at least 6 that I noticed and it has never been that many.  The prizes are always a hit or miss its constantly changing from month to month the selection some times good other times meh.  A lot of toys catering to the younger kids that frequent the place with there parents.  You'll need at least 1500 tickets if you want an impressive medium sized stuffed animal or such.  There can be some cool stuff DS games (50000 tickets), ipods but yes you need to save up your tickets for that.  I did notice these days they have less licensed stuffies (ie disney) mostly generic teddy bears ect.   A staff member overheard me talking to my friend and told me its because things like that are popular because of movies and such and when they are no longer popular they get stuck with the merchandise that won't move.   I think they should still try and have things like smurfs and care bears.    ***TIPS***** If you do still plan on going (because really it is the only place like this around and is fun) be sure to sign up for there rewards program.  They give excellent perks via monthly coupons that are emailed (ie buy and entree get a free entree, or spend $20 on a power card receive $20).  These coupon really help off set there prices which aren't the cheapest.  Also if lines are long at the mid way cashier for power card recharge and they often are the front desk can also charge up your power card and they is hardly ever a line there."}
{"text":"Make sure to bring your ID with you!!!   There are couple open areas for food, a bar in the open restaurant, arcade games, and a bar in the middle of the \"arcade room\". Can't comment on the food as I never dined at D&B - once the wait for 2 was 1 hour 30.   The bar area is self seating, with large screen TVs, ideal for watching sports. Drinks are reasonably priced until you realize how \"unconcentrated\"/watered down the drinks are.   The biggest complaint is probably the arcade machines. There are always too many out of service machines, no matter which day I go. Worse is, a handful of machines don't work after taking your \"points\" out of the card. You then have to find a staff to help you get your points back after explaining to them what happened. It takes the fun out of fuss free arcade games when this happens couple times a night within 2 hours.  On the bright side, they are constantly adding new machines!  Regardless of all the negative things about D&B, I will continue to come here as there aren't many places like it here in the GTA."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be rating a D&B but it's happening.   First of all - their happy hour is phenomenal! Like where else can you drink Jameson for $3 a shot?! (Yes, I'm serious). I've been to other D&Bs and Gameworks and I have always gotten great service at this one, especially in comparison to others.   Bartenders and servers are great. Sometimes the service bar can take a minute, but as a previous bartender, I also know what it's like to be in their shoes and they do pretty damn well for how busy they can get. They are always really cool and do cater to their customers.   I like coming here with my friends, coworkers, and just have a good time. They keep it pretty clean, the food is good for bar food and is pretty competitive with like a BWW.   Yes, there's a ton of kids but also a lot of adult fun. There aren't a ridiculous amount of games but there are a lot. I enjoy coming here on date night, for happy hours, or just at random cause I'm at DT summerlin. It's one of the best D&B's service and food wise that I've been to between here and Southern California."}
{"text":"Linda was very unpleasant. We seemed to have burdened her with smiles and tips. Asking to change our form of payment once and we were \" too much for her \". Lieing about all (at least 3 wells at the bar)water guns being broken at the bar, she proceeded to charge my friends for thier water bottles that she served instead. Saw other bartenders playing n spraying the water gun behind the bar soon after she said they were broken. I'm sure she had been on her shift fr a while/ hours because it was passed 9pm. Long enough to figure out whether the guns worked. Plus we saw other patrons with iced water and we asked another bartender if the guns wer broken and he no. I ordered happy hour food that never arrived. Which caused me to miss play time with friends. Told another bartender( other than Linda bevause she's terrible) he didn't do anything about it(that was another 10-15min wait). So instead of askin again I went to a manager instead. Manager gave me a play card. By then my friends were just about done playing so I gave it away to some kid. Waited a total of 45+min. Overall bad experience. I will never return."}
{"text":"Sooo we came here to check it out for my wife's bday in a few weeks. The place wasn't busy at all and after we sat down we waited about 15 min and then my wife had to go find someone to get our order taken. Then it took about another 20-30 min and we mainly had appetizers. Didn't get refills on the drinks. The waitress had no clue what beers were on special. After we were done eating it took another 10-15 min to get the check. Would've had better food and service going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Their bathrooms are so disgusting every time I come here. No paper towels. Dirty floor. Smells awful. I don't know how you can even stand to work in a place with bathrooms like this."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Dave & Buster's establishment and I can say I enjoyed myself the UFC fight was on, the bar was full and the drinks were even better. The only thing that I did not like what's the wait at the door to grab a table but after finding a seat at the bar me and my girls were still not informed once our table was ready so we just dined at bar. I will be back to others closer to my hometown in Alabama to get in on the playime.."}
{"text":"i dont know why all the bad review but we had a good time eating and playing we will come back too."}
{"text":"I went here for a work outing on a Friday afternoon. Maybe arcades aren't as exciting when you're no longer a kid? Maybe I'm too cheap to pay DOLLARS for a single game play? Who knows but I'm glad I wasn't picking up the tab.   Server was nice in the eating area but when I requested a vegan option (btw, they'd been notified the day before by one of our team members there were special diets people coming) the guy was completely confused but thought the veggie burger was acceptable. Fine with me. We also have a celiac and lactose intolerant person with us - they did have allergen menus. She was able to order a chicken dish and brccoli no butter. Too bad they brought it out sopping in butter. It wasn't until the other dishes were brought out that I was notified the veggie burger had eggs in it. Fine, what else can you do? NOTHING. Um, not even a salad? Uh, I don't think so. Whatever, I left I got a salad from the food court and brought it back to eat with others.   No, I don't expect great dining at a place like this but I do expect them to come up with something when hosting a company function and are notified in advance.   Games - I'm not a gamer so this may not be fair but nothing really made me want to spend my own money.   Bar - decent beer selection considering but overpriced .I'm guessing if I was there with Junior I'd pay over $5 for a domestic draft too.   I'm not going back. Missing Jillians."}
{"text":"Awful service and the order was wrong. We sat for about 25 minutes before I asked a server to help us, waited an additional 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and the order had a few errors. The server was disingenuous, which didn't help the situation. I spoke with a manager, which I rarely do, and he genuinely seemed to care and helped us out. Hopefully they work the glitches out."}
{"text":"So I keep reading bad reviews about the service, and I have to come to their defense here. I had a slight problem with a coupon and this manager named Chris solved it in two seconds. Then I got some food from the bar, and the wait staff was extremely attentive and nice. This place was fun, clean, and worth the trip. Dirty Driving is a good game, I feel like I can outrace anyone"}
{"text":"Great place to go eat and watch a game or play a game! If you go Fri night it's a young crowd so you might want to go during the week if you're older"}
{"text":"What a great experience!!! Company outing. Great customer service and great atmosphere. We all enjoyed ourselves. Food was great!!! From the vegetarian lasagna to the small cake squares. What a great way tobspend a work day!! Thank you for an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I always have so much fun here , yes it is a little expensive and you might not get that many points to get a big price but the games are fun and also they have good deals at the bar , the food I honestly think that they are not a real restaurant but they are doing great the burgers especially, fries ,pasta and salads are really good for a bar food . Service is not the best the bartenders seem distracted but overall i like it ."}
{"text":"Rating this place strictly on the food and service. We went on a busy Saturday night and put our name on the list for the dining room. Two and a half hours later they said it would be longer and half of the dining room was empty tables. It wasn't until I started complaining that suddenly a table opened up. Food was just ok after waiting so long. Games are fun though."}
{"text":"1. Call the day before to ask about UFC202 cover and they say there is no cover, today its $10 a person.  2. After waiting 45 minutes for a table within 10 miutes of sitting 5 different people asked if we were seated by a waitress assuming we sat ourselves, yet nobody else was asked.  3. I inform our waiter that I have a food allergy and wanted to know if the appetizer we wanted had that particular food in it. He went to check and when he came back he told me they couldn't accomodate my my allergy due to cross contamination.... wait... huh? I tell him we want the appetizer anyway and I will order something different, he then walked away from the table without taking our order.   I think it's safe to say we will not be going to this D&B again."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and it fell way below them. The clientel is trashy and rude making the environment gross and obnoxious. Crowds of people stand around blocking games that they aren't even playing. We had some trouble using our game cards which we originally got from the Desert Ridge location. We waited about 20 to 30 minutes to be seated and after we got seated we sat there for another 20 to 30 minutes and a server never came over to us. The restaurant was not super busy and there were several empty tables so we should have been served in a timely manner. The table next to us waited even longer to be served. Even for this location only being open about a week they should have had their staff better trained. We ended up walking out and going somewhere else to get food. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The main purpose to visit this place was to watch the hockey, basketball and baseball game. They were able to accommodate us for that however the service was so horrible. It took forever to get our appetizers. The bartenders had a bad attitude with the exception of one server that seemed to be working very hard at keeping the customers happy.  The quality of the food is average with very limited healthy choices."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's is the dream of every adult who is still a kid at heart. For all the arcade enthusiasts, sports fans, and those who like to have drinks at a bar followed by some virtual racing, this place is the bomb.  Back in my hometown, a place like this doesn't exist and when visiting Arizona, I needed to give it a try. Although there were plenty of kids making their way around when we went, we didn't feel out of place by going here. Note: We didn't spend any time downstairs and were by the bar and arcade the majority of the time.  I highly recommend looking up any online deals. We were able to use one to get over a hundred points (not sure on the exact number) on our Dave & Buster's card for a little over $20 and there were enough points that I still had plenty over left over after an hour. Tickets were relatively easy to win and the prizes were extensive.  For me, I wouldn't come here for the dining experience. The bar had some good drinks and the fries were some of the best I've had but, based on the orders of my friends, the fries and drinks are what I would limit myself to when not enjoying the arcade. Hope to see what the locations in other states are like because of how many leftover points I have."}
{"text":"Its a Sunday... 2 hour wait for a table!  Sat at the bar waiting.... took 20 minutes just to get a drink!! They dont acknowledge you sitting there at all!!  Had the pineapple, coconut. Was 10 dollars for a cup of ice pretty much!  Need more waiters and waitresses. Should maybe offer something for wating.. i was there for a teen bday party, we played a few games then ate at peter piper pizza! Time to comsider reorganizing your place dave and busters!"}
{"text":"Dave and busters your food is a joke.  When in order a platter I expect more for the price you charge than a pic I'll couple of pieces.  Def overcharged"}
{"text":"Dear Bri, there is a reason that you didn't recieve a tip and there is a reason that we didn't pay our bill. That reason was you. First off you need to listen and make sure you understand what is being order. Also helps if you have a basic understanding of the menu. Now here is the next important thing before you bring drinks to my table please  make sure we have recieved our silverware. I had to ask another server after i asked you to get us some napkins and silverware. Which you brought to the table next to us. Also if a customer orders a steak well done make sure they cook the steak on the grill till its well done. Not just medium amd then microwave it the rest of the way and hope it gets there. You are quality control for the kitchen. Because you work off tips you need to make sure you tables food is the best even if you have to refuse to take something out till its right. So I hope last night was a good learning experience. The ribs amd grilled chicken were dried out as well. Normally I have a great time here. Next time we will go eat at chipotle then come play games. At least there I will expect the terrible service and sub par food.  The games were fun."}
{"text":"Dear D&B,  Your place is a cacophonous rip-off that serves no other purpose than to give parents a migraine while bilking us out of $100 to provide 30 minutes of vapid entertainment all for the sake of winning three packets of Fun-Dip and stale gummy bears."}
{"text":"My nieces are visiting for the summer so we went here. The food was mediocre.. but edible. Waaaaay over priced. The service is horrible. I gave three stars because the happy hour is decent!"}
{"text":"Went to D&B for the first time after a bad restaurant experience somewhere else for dinner. The hostess was a little rude and the some of our groups food came out somewhat wrong but no biggie, they fixed it quick. Our waitress, I think her name was Hannah was a sweetheart. The portobello burger was delicious. Will return for a fun night with the kids soon to try out the arcade part."}
{"text":"This place would be okay if it were clean. It's seriously nasty. The bathrooms reek of urine, no soap, the floors are disgusting. They give the employees a child-sized broom to sweep for some reason and it shows. I would never eat here. The bar was filthy, never wiped. The games are fun, but after an hour or so I had to leave because I felt like I'd contract a disease. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this place it was to just play games and have a few drinks, overall I had fun and it was an okay experience but nothing worth doing that often.  Second time was to watch a basketball game and it was perfect because the bar area was not crowded at all, plenty of TVs to watch the game and the bartenders were great. Their personalities and fast attentive service deserved 5 stars. I would possibly come back to watch another game in the future.  The third time, we had dinner and wanted to stay and play some games after. The food was horrible and that's all I have to say about that. So much that we didn't even stay to play games afterwards because I was so disappointed with the food that it ruined my mood and I just wanted to go home.   Come for the games and maybe some drinks but don't bother with the food trust me"}
{"text":"Lucky it won't let me give them negative stars. Customer service sucks the waitress was very rude. We sat in the booths near the bar, no one came over to greet us, give us a menu or anything at all. My husband had to stand up and go to the bar to order us food and drinks, we had to take our drinks to get our own refills. Not once had a server came by to check on us. Complete shit! I love D&B but definitely not this one. Management better step in and do something about some of the staff, they don't belong working with customers."}
{"text":"Over priced boring food. We ordered two apptz the sliders & wings for $15. Where we rcvd 4 little sliders & 4wings. We also ordered the $19. App platter thinking these two would be filled & loaded with food. Not much food but way way over priced. We were a party of 5 & not enough food to go around. Very disappointed in the quality, the over price & the wait staff who did not have time to explain anything!!!"}
{"text":"It's alot of fun at Dave & Busters hands down!! It also gets really expensive really quick too.  We started off with a meal and the food was meh. We have decided to eat elsewhere  before we come next time. ; )  The games were awesome and alot of fun. My favorite was the large Pac Man game!   It wasn't that busy even though we came on a Wednesday. The games were half off which was pretty cool. Even with the savings though,  we still spent quite a bit for our party of 5 about $40 a person.  Definitely worth it. :)  Las Vegas Metro Police Officers were there which was a pleasant suprise. Nice to know that this particular Dave & Busters   establishment  cares about the safety of its patrons.  We definitely will be back. :) Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"My husband's employee Christmas party was held here! I was impressed by the team work! All the employees helped and worked together. The food was amazing! All you can eat buffets! Fresh food kept on coming and delicious desserts! The customer service is outstanding! Drinks were served to you. We got drink menus. The whole place was closed down for party!! It was an unforgettable experience!! We were treated like celebrities!"}
{"text":"My friend and I planned on surprising our friend for her birthday with a trip to Dave and Busters (since she had been talking about it for a while). So Friday comes and we eventually make our way for the celebration to begin. We arrived around 4:55pm and it was already crowded. We were all hungry so we wanted to sit and eat first and then we would eventually play games. Well the wait time was about 35 to 55 minutes so we all decided to go to a close restaurant to get some drinks. Well I needed to sneak away to see if they could possibly keep a cake I had ordered for the birthday girl in their fridge along with seeing how long we had left. I was able to meet one of the managers Sean who took the cake for me until we wanted it brought out. Once we got seated our bubbly waitress Breanna came by and welcomed us and took our drink orders along with wishing the birthday girl a Happy Birthday. The appetizer we ordered was the loaded tater tots and it was pretty good. All 3 of us ordered the Sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and bacon wrapped shrimp and creamed corn which we enjoyed. The ONLY thing we agreed on was the bacon wrapped shrimp was very salty (and was way too much fat on the bacon). When we were ready for the cake to come out, let's just say the birthday girl was definitely surprised. Even another waitress ran to get candles and a lighter so the birthday girl could make her wish. The games were great although it was crowded so it was hard to get to play some of the most popular games. Overall the staff was very friendly and it meant a lot to the birthday girl for having the GM Phil stopping by to say Happy Birthday. Now I understand Dave and Busters just opened but the amount of friendliness from the staff we encountered made us want to come back many more times."}
{"text":"Stopped in for order to go after a long day. Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with a side side of bbq. After taking 10 minutes to pay for food (cashier needs training), food arrived without the bbq. I then realized the Philly Cheesesteak only had steak and cheese. No onions and peppers. They brought me raw diced peppers. Seriously?  Really pause before you decide to come."}
{"text":"Service is awful bartender looking right at is won't even ask if needed any thing only thing good about this place is the games"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Kids and adults to have fun. Quality of food is not so great.  Great concept. Food and Games.  The games are expensive. The games use \"points\" as the currency. You load your game card with \"Points\" with actual money. the game range about 3 - 10 points. which can translate to about $2 for a game. (Except on Wednesdays, where the game cost is half) The food was just OK. taste like everything is frozen and just heated up.   The upstairs is Very Loud. so bring some ear plugs. the volume of the games is set very high. and when you have over 100 games with a high volume you end up with just loud noise! It would help if the volumes of all the games were durned down just a little bit.  Overall it was fun. The kids seemed to like it a lot. and there are things for adults to do at the same time."}
{"text":"So I've been to a few Dave and Busters and they have all been pretty much the same experience...drink, eat and play games.  This one definitely is the same formula....BUT  The biggest difference I've noticed is how new this space is. It opened up in August of 2016 so everything is super clean and it really is fun to go to while in Downtown Summerlin.   Service is mediocre as many of the people seem like they don't enjoy their job and it kinda kills the fun vibe.   Food isn't amazing just enough of quality to fill you up.   Games are pretty cool def haven't seen some of these and almost every game is multiplayer which is really fun."}
{"text":"Went with my son before a movie the other weekend and enjoyed the games and kid friendly atmosphere. Would have liked to try some of their experimental food offerings but just didn't have the time...maybe next time"}
{"text":"This D&B sucked! Lauren P is my girlfriend and the photos she added, That was my burger. It was effing disgusting! How do you mess up a dang burger. I love D&B but I will never come back to the concord mills one. Save you money and dont eat here."}
{"text":"Food  was good . Too cold Dining area. Server was ok. Once I get food  , I was looking  server between my dinner to refill my water. He came after I had my dinner, he asked for check , when I got check I asked him for water. Overall soso experience."}
{"text":"This is the place where an adult could be a kid again. Played games here several times already since it opened and I highly recommend coming here on a Wednesday since games are half off.  Every time I come here it's pretty crowded. I usually come during the evening time between 9-2. The wait time for each game is not that bad. Plenty of games to enjoy such as basketball, shooting and racing games.  Happy hour time most days are 9-closing so alcohol and playing arcade games makes it a lot more fun. Plenty of television screens around the bar area to watch plenty of sports. Right now this is the best place if you are trying to watch the Olympics.  Prices for the games were not that bad. The super charge comes in clutch for an extra few dollars. I bought the best value one which is like $50 something and I've been here a lot already and still have enough points to keep going.  Not sure how the food is here but I heard it was good and I have not yet experience cashing out my tickets for prizes so I am looking forward to that next time I come here."}
{"text":"I was told by the staff at the front counter to use the app because I could use a buy $20 get $20 chips coupon. I proceeded to purchase the $20 order of chips and received a notification that said the app charged me $20 but could not deliver the chips into the account due to an error. I talked to the manager and he told me that there was nothing he could do about the error. I mentioned that I was told to use the app to get the coupon and he did not care to help in the slightest. I went outside to call the D&B support to get a refund but there was no number to call so I went back inside to demand a refund or a chip transfer into my account. The manager said he could not use the coupon because they do not have it in the system so he could not give me the chips I paid for. I went back outside, found the coupon online, and went back inside to show the manager that I have a coupon with a barcode. He then proceeded to help an employee load the chips into my card, and gave me the chips I originally purchased without receiving. HOWEVER, HE DID NOT SCAN MY COUPON. This means that when he told me that he could not honor the coupon on the app because it did not exist in the system, he lied to my face. This is shameful. It took me about half an hour to get the chips I paid for and not only did the manager not want to help, but he even lied to my face about not being able to give me the chips that I paid for. I have never written a negative review on Yelp before, but this is the worst behavior I have ever seen from a manager at any business. I will be surprised if I ever support this D&B location again."}
{"text":"This unique and fun place is like a kid's Atlantic City or Vegas, or a high-end Chuck E. Cheese!  Adults can, and do have fun here too!  It reminds me of some of the super arcades on the boardwalk at the Jersey Shore I used to frequent as a pimply teen, but a bit larger and way classier.  There apparently is NO other place like this in Northeast Ohio, and I consider it one of the many assets around here.  There are TONS of video and mechanical arcade type games in a converted warehouse setting (though carpeted, paneled and upscale), with a full service adult bar and dining booths dab smack in the middle of it all.  There is also a larger restaurant by the entrance, with good food I might add.  I had a salmon dinner, which was very good.  I do wish, however, that they had more low calorie options for those who are watching their diets.  Anywho, like Chuck E. Cheeseball, they have a prize store in the back where one can redeem all the tickets they have won for a gaggle of varied items ranging from candy to stuffed animals to kid's telescopes to t-shirts to remote control copters and X-boxes!  My child attended a birthday party there, and we stayed an extra 2 hours and spent an additional $30 dollars, in addition to the $15 game playing credit she got on her card (they give you a game card with a magnetic strip in order to track your game credits and/or ticket winnings) initially as a birthday party attendee.  In the few hours she spent ninja-slicing fruit, scoring soccer goals, steering hyperspeed 'crotch rockets', and spinning kids slots, she amassed enough tickets to trade in for a simple pair of binoculars, 2 stuffed animals, a frisbee, and a fuzzy pink kid's journal!  She was happy, which made me happy!  Quality time with your child at it's best!  The only downside, is that D&B's is indeed a bit pricey for many families, especially if you have a few 'ankle-biters' in tow.  The employees were very kind and helpful, by the way.  We will return!  HIGHLY recommended, even if you only visit once out of curiosity!"}
{"text":"Foos is typical bar food but I like it, and it's usually pretty consistent.   Had the wings with a trio of sauces and they were good.  The Carolina reaper sauce was hot but they tamp it down so it's not bad.  Had the salmon and it was ok, not really great. Prob seemed worse cause I had it out someplace else the night before and it was so good that it didn't compare.  We had the chocolate fondue pot for dessert and it was so good!  Washed it all down with the top shelf million dollar margarita and it was a good day"}
{"text":"Service isn't as bad as all the reviews make it seem, I was hesitant because of the reviews but it wasn't as bad, waiting to get seated was a little irritating because two girls were talking but our server was nice and our food came out quickly and tasted great. I will be back for the drinks and games next time."}
{"text":"D and B has really gone down hill over the past few years.  The food used to be tolerable, now its just bad.  The drinks are decent, but they have nothing on tap for beers.  Its the same video games they have had for the past 10 years.  Nothing new, so no reason to go.  Its too bad, because it used to be a good time."}
{"text":"Both of my visits have been absolutely terrible-Servers need major improvement.  The two times I visited, the wait time was just horrible but my most recent experience had to be the worst I've ever experienced in my whole life.  This past Sunday when I went, a girl that served us took forever and I believe her name is Joanna. It took thirty minutes for her to bring out our first round of drinks(which was one beer tower). Throughout the whole time of her serving she had an unwelcoming vibe and attitude. And after much frustration, we closed our tab out with her and caught her trying to do us dirty. When she handed back our change, our receipt was no longer there with the incorrect change. So then we ask her for an itemized receipt to double check everything and what do you know, there was more change added to it and she claimed that she did the math incorrectly(Way to try and tip yourself).  I get it, you're frustrated and you think people are going to cut you short on tip but that's never okay. My friends around me were so fired up that they rambled on about how they didn't want to leave a tip... but I couldn't do it. At the end of the night I pulled her aside and tipped her an extra $20 and told her why we were frustrated and I hope she learns from this experience. I almost regret it because even after me trying to be understanding of her actions, she still tried to blame everything on the kitchen and the bar...Regardless of whether or not this is your first serving job, it still isn't okay to treat people like crap and this is coming from a fellow first time server herself.  Lesson learned: will just go straight to the bar"}
{"text":"Food and service in restaurant leaves much to be desired.  When we arrived they said it would be 10 min wait. Only one table had someone. They just wanted you to go to the arcade. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Traveling through we enjoy this as a stop.    It seemed crazy busy with quit a line but we weren't gaming just wanted a nice lunch.  So if this is your plan, just go to dining check I'm passed gamer purchase desk.  Waiter was great, knowledgeable,  We haven't had bad foods."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really recommend D&B's for a place to eat, but who comes here to eat??? The best part about this place is that you can drink inside and they let you bring your cup around to the different games.  It can seem a little small and cramped inside, but they have a huge variety of different selection of games from Mario Kart, to life sized gummy boxing things, to almost regular sized basketball shooting machines.   Don't forget to sign up for their email newsletter if you come here regularly because they give awesome deals if you already have one of those game cards. Sometimes they double the value of how much you pay for, like give you a free $20 worth of gaming which is awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a nice finding since we've moved to AZ. My kids love to go n play there. Once we get there we forget how late in the night it is. They have now brought in new games & have redone with the place. It's now better than ever"}
{"text":"This was our first time to eat at this restaurant-guessing it will be our last!  I will admit that the fires and tater tots were delicious but the burger that I ordered as medium came out well done and it had to be some type of pre-made patty because it was literally dry...no juice to be seen coming from the burger! Sure the waitress offered to have it redone but by that time we had already waited 20 ministers and my husband was already eating....why would I want to wait again! So basically I had fries for dinner! To top it off there's wasn't even an offer to reduce the ticket!  The games here must be good because the food sure wasn't"}
{"text":"Dave & Busters is like Vegas where you cannot win any money and there are no strippers.  My friend Martin had his birthday party here - I had never been before - the food was pretty good for a chain restaurant.  I had some tempura mushrooms with very good ranch dressing for dipping (and, if you think all ranch dressing is good, you are mistaken - I have had my fair share of disgusting ranch dressing.)  I also had teriyaki sirloin steak (bloody rare) with mashed potatoes that had a bunch of crap in them.  And, by crap I mean cheese, bacon and sour cream.  Very tasty.  The price was a little on the high side, but I think I expected that.  The games were fun to watch my friends play... I'm not very good at arcade games so I didn't bother to waste my money.  Though, I was a little peeved because when I went into the gift shop thingie there was this wicked cool *Darth Vader statuette which said \"I am your father\" and \"Don't underestimate the Force\" and \"I find your lack of faith disturbing\" when you pressed a button.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/adorkablegrrl/1203839953/  I totally wanted that.  Dave & Busters are cheeseballs and wouldn't even entertain the notion of me offering them $20 for the dang thing... they wanted tickets.  But, by that time it was late and I was tired/cranky and I didn't want to bother with trying to win 1,200 fucking tickets.  All in all a good evening, even if I am hugely disappointed that I didn't come home with Darth tonight.  *They had a Yoda one, too... but, it was kinda lame."}
{"text":"We went on  Friday night, and had no wait time for a table, a group of 6. Food was decent but service was a tad slow. We ended up using the bowling alley which was really cute, aside from the stench of feet. Yes, that entire hallway leading to the bowling alley stinks like feet. (I guess the bowling shoes, who knows). They had cosmic bowling with music and video screens, but all that plays on the screens are sporting events. lanes were a bit pricey-$25 an hour on a friday."}
{"text":"My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced."}
{"text":"I love Dave and busters! Always super fun and the energy in there is perfect for kids!"}
{"text":"Food was gross, I got the Philly cheesesteak and it was so salty. My boyfriend got the Philly cheesesteak burger and he said it didn't taste fresh.  We got calamari as a starter and it was literally 10% calamari and 90% deep fried onion and deep fried banana pepper. There were only 10 pieces of calamari. $10.89 for 10 pieces for calamari. Horrible food. Our total for our food was $42.  Our server Garret was nice though."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I have never seen a more absent and apathetic staff in my life. Not only did I stand at a host stand for 15 minutes without being greeted by anyone, the service was only more pathetic when I sat myself in the open seating bar area. I sat at a high top by the bar for over 45 minutes without seeing a server. I then went to the bar and to order a beer, and the bartender said \"the servers are busy\". I have been a server. I know things can get slammed. But this place was maybe half full, at best. I was unable to sit at any other location, as all of the tables hadn't been bussed yet. I then proceeded to drink my one beer before closing out and leaving. This means I sat through AN ENTIRE FIRST HALF of a football game without a server ever coming near me. I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Jillian's is hard to put a finger on because it's so many things.  Upscale arcade and bowling, dance club, bar, pool hall and a couple different restaurants.  For the purpose of my review, I'm going to focus on the arcade.   I'm a skee-ball fiend and it has some premium lanes.  The whole arcade is very clean and well maintained.  It can be pretty crowded with families of kids but you have to remind yourself that you are on their turf.  The downside is that Jillian's uses one of those \"credit card\" point systems that makes it a little harder to keep track of how much you are actually spending on games.   What ever happened to the honest 1 quarter to 1 token ratio?!"}
{"text":"I will Never go back again!!! 50 min ride with 8 people, 5 under 10 yrs old. Only to have our reservations lost, told our cupcakes were not allowed and to take them out of the building and we had to wait 1 hour and 15 min to be seated. F that! We went to swings and things half the price, more professional privately owned place. They saved the day for me and my daughter's 10th birthday party. Dave and busters investers and owners need to look into the way the staff and the managers speak to the customers, they were short, annoyed  and preoccupied. They burned this bridge. They lost over 400.00 in potential income from me today. Blessing in disguise."}
{"text":"Took the family here to this disaster. 70 min to get food. 20 min to receive simple waters/sodas. After an additional 20 minute i was told by the waiter that they didn't have the ingredients to make an Old Fashion. Wtf? You don't have ice, sugar, whisky, and bitters?  A freakin mini bar would be more helpful!  I came in with very low expectations and they were successful at not even meeting them."}
{"text":"Ya know, this place isn't that half bad, but honestly, I don't come here to play the games.  I only came here to eat, and that was awesome.  I like it here, even though this place is an adult chuckie cheeses.  I can appriciate the fact that they have games n stuff, but I'm not into that.  Traditional menu, with burgers, salads, chicken, and an all around fair selection of stuff to eat.  I got the burger, but I dont remember what Austin had to eat.  Our server was Hillel, and he was such a wonderful guy, and paid attention to us during our visit.  I would return,  and had a good time.  Not bad."}
{"text":"Every few months I have to make the trek here to play some skeeball and Ms Pac-Man.   They have a ton of video games plus pool tables.  I did not eat here on this trip, but in general their food is ok - nothing special - certainly runs circles around someplace like Chuck E. Cheese.  When I do order I get one of the eat and play combos because it is a good value.  The portions are a good size and they have a good variety."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night and the place was deadsville.  Since we have a couple of kids we elected to go upstairs for them to partake in the games.  We ordered a couple of combo meals, which was food and tokens for the games.  When the kids wiped through the tokens, we started to realize that.the games were a little on the pricey side.  No more.games after that.  When the food.arrived we were all quite hungry.. but alas, even that didn't help.  The food was dull, unevenly warm and served in haste.  Grandpa liked his ribs but everything else was just plain average.  I got the feeling from looking at things like cleanliness and staff uniforms that the management is just barely holding on."}
{"text":"Not impressed! This was mine and my husband's first time here. We were seated right away with no problem since it was not busy or crowded at that time, but then we waited 15 minutes before the waitress, who was very sweet, to take our drink orders, by that time we had decided what we wanted to eat so just gave her our order, also thinking we may not get another chance to order. THAT is when the wait really started! It was an hour to get our food! then  when it did arrive it was COLD to the point the cheese on the burger would not even melt! We went ahead and ate it anyways since we were not sure about getting another meal in a short amount of time. IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. IF YOU ARE STARVING THIS IS NOT THE PLACE"}
{"text":"Great place to have some drinks specially if you are a local the barteders are great Ashton man she is the best she has served us the best all night long she is the best!! The tater tots are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dave and Busters probably a dozen times over the past seven years. Nothing has ever changed: on the dining side you have a complete abomination to the service industry. Food is mediocre, service is slow and the attendants could care less. This has been my experience every time I've been here. For the record, I'm usually attending as part of a work function or group outing.  The most recent time I was at D&B's they had a decent meal and play card - for $25 you could choose from a decent selection of entrées and receive a $10 play card.  The games area is above average for adult gaming centres. There are a lot of games and they seem to keep it pretty fresh. Other places like this I've been to often have areas that look run-down. So go on D&Bs for keeping their area looking nice.  TO SUM IT UP: Until they're able to replace their service staff with robots that can fain happiness and good customer service skip the dining and just go here for the slightly above average gaming experience."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's is a fun place that brings people of all ages! I went there to play some games with my friend and he won big time! We had a lot of fun. There are many childhood favorites  to choose from and some new cool games like Walking Dead! We got to shoot zombies! It's a wonderful idea for a night out with a date, friends or your family."}
{"text":"Service was downright awful. Server got three out of five orders wrong. Everything took at least ten minutes, including a request for ketchup. Just waiting to get our card back after paying took twenty minutes. That's twenty minutes of play time with our birthday girl that we lost.  The dining end of this place is kinda horrid.  Games were fun and varied. No complaints there. But the food end was mediocre at best and the service was downright bad.  You can do so much better."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the UFC fight. 10 dollar cover which isn't bad at all compared to other spots. Surprisingly there was a booth open in the open seating area, I've been to many fights and it's usually a full house so I was stoked. I was immediately greeted by Schyler, he was awesome. Made sure I was all good until the rest of my party came and greeted and helped them the exact same way. Never did I once have to look around and find him. He was very attentive and he had multiple tables. This is top notch service. I hope when I go back next time Schyler helps us out again. Although everyone else was also very nice. This is definitely a change from going to BWW where you don't get even CLOSE to the same service. So again, thank you Schyler, we will be returning for the next one! :)."}
{"text":"I love Dave and Busters!!  It is a great place to go when you are wanting to have a great time with a great group of friends.  If you find you and your friends bored on a Friday or Saturday night, come to D&B and win some prizes!!  It is pricey though, so bring some major moolah"}
{"text":"Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of going to Dave and Buster's to entertain a child (or grandchild) between 5 and 10 years old, this review is for you.  Although Dave and Buster's has food -- the downstairs is a regular sitdown restaurant -- the food is mediocre comfort fare.  It's not terrible but it is nothing I would want to go out especially for.  For example, the burger was a half-pound patty of decent meat, with a slice of onion and a slice of tomato, and it tasted pretty much like any other burger. The sweet potato fries were not crisp.  Upstairs is an extremely noisy area with a collection of electronic games, most of which dispense tickets which you can cash in for prizes.  You know the kind of place I mean.  Dave and Buster's differs slightly from the norm.  For one thing, the machines are in good repair.  The prizes are all mid-range (it will cost you typically $60 to get a 10-inch stuffed animal), with no super-expensive things that you have to mortage a small home to win.  But you will recover only a small percentage of your expense in the value of the prize, so it has to be considered for fun only.  For my party, including a child, it was not that much fun.  I will spend my entertainment money elsewhere.  HINT:  Wednesday is the time to go if you want to play the games - they are half price.  Even at half price, a typical game still costs $1."}
{"text":"first time at aD&B.  the food and service was very good.   happy hour!  snow cone drinks fun!   game play fun!   wish there were items cheaper than 75 tickets.   I'll have to save up my tickets."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to check this place out on Friday night. We played a bunch of games for a few hours, got hungry and wanted to eat. We got seated around 1AM, well aware that the place closed at 2AM we politely asked our waitress if it was still ok to order food. She was more than willing to take our order. We enjoyed our meal and finished eating right around 2AM. Once we finished closing our tab, another waiter walks by our table and ask us if we finished paying, we told him yes and his response to us was, \"well you guys can leave now, we're closed!\"  I understand that you guys had a long work day and are ready to go home, but there is a polite way to tell customers that they are closed and would like us to leave. A simple, \"just to let you guys know, we are closed and will be cleaning up\" would have sufficed."}
{"text":"Not my thing - food is ok but I'm not a big game player."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Dave & Buster's, and it was excellent!  Our Server, Dominic aka Dom the Bomb was outstanding!  Great energy, always a smile, really attentive and professional.  The food was excellent!  Everything ordered had a great taste n seasoned just right.  We enjoyed our dinner so much, we forgot to play...our next visit will be reversed.  We'll play, then eat...We had such a great experience."}
{"text":"Really great for a non-typical date night! We came on Monday and bought about 125 tokens, which lasted us much longer than I anticipated. It wasn't crowded and we never had to wait for a game. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very bizarre and unpleasant experience at Dave & Buster's at Westgate yesterday. She had bought a $50 gift card for us, so we ordered four dishes, including a couple to take home. After we ate I gave the waitress the gift card so she could credit us and save a little time. She returned about 5 minutes later, announced that our bill was \"fifty dollars and change\", and that we were \"okay\", then walked off. She never showed us the itemized bill. Isn't it obvious what happened? We think the waitress never rang up our order and she pocketed our gift card. We figured the bill and I don't think we were out any money, but our experience guaranteed that we'll never be back to this location or any other Dave & Buster's for that matter. The food wasn't bad but the experience was horrible."}
{"text":"The girl at the front desk was rude, obviously doesn't like working there but what about a simple welcome or hello? I decided to give this place a try anyway but couldn't get passed the rude reception. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"I was at Dave and Busters at Desert Ridge last week. Our bartender was absolutely amazing. Her name was Jessy. As a local business owner I will definitely bring my staff in for future events."}
{"text":"I have to say I do love D&B.  The food has improved for sure. I had a chicken sandwich with guac and a side of fries.  Super good.  All of the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Two managers came over to our table and asked how everything was going.  The game selection is good.  And on Tuesdays the games are half-price.  Basically we played what we wanted when we wanted.  The only thing that I still don't love is the prizes. Any reasonable prize takes thousands of tickets, and has you come back either multiple times are never cash them in at all."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the Dave and Busters concept.. my issue comes down to the way I was educated on the best solution that fit my needs .. they have this power play combo that is a \"special\" here is the thing I was told it's a Great deal! After the damn worker at front counter took my $25 for the power card I purchase plus I tipped her $5 .. after which she mentions the special and made it out as if I can just pay $10 to get the deal..  Enter in my date arriving , sitting down and we got Phil as our server .. he's awesome if you're in there and here is too definitely seek him out .. he sat down next to me to explain the process and promos ... problem is what I was told at the front didn't work the way the First Lady explained .. now remember I'm a female on a date I am not looking to escalate or rock the boat but Phil did try to remedy and fix my issue by offering to seek a manager to adjust it but as I said .. I'm being taken out and trying to enjoy my company so I figured I'd save it for the review but I did advise Phil ( who was awesome about taking the feedback and offering to pass it forward ) that it really turned me off to the idea of eating food or sticking around . So what happened because the girl at the front made me feel scammed ?   When my date offered to add more money on the power up card , I was ready to leave .. they could of had a huge meal and drinks plus more money spent on games had full disclosure and proper training and team work been in place..  I hope next time I go they have it together and make sure their power card sales folks educate about the combos...  The games are fun especially the 3D game but.. yeah I can't speak to the food yet"}
{"text":"Dashawn the bartender is amazing. I came in there and didn't have to wait for service even though it was a full bar. Hes quick, super friendly and polite.He Made me a awesome tasty drink that I'll come back again for. Being in the service industry myself I truly appreciate great customer service and because of him I'll be back again."}
{"text":"D&B's has finally made it to Vegas, and this location is bigger and better than ever. We previously visited the D&B's in Arcadia, CA and was not impressed at all. We decided to give the company another shot and are much more pleased with this location.   Perhaps it's because of the recent opening and no one hates their job yet, but the vibe upon entrance is light and happy. Everyone seemed happy to be at work and we were greeted with smiles from multiple employees.    Before playing the games, we decided to grab a bite to eat. There was no wait and our server came over immediately. (Save yourself the trouble and seat yourself -- they're not very good about letting you know that there is no need to wait for a host). The menu can be a little pricey, but items generally range from $12-$19. We got some burgers, the mac&cheese, and chicken alfredo. One of my friends got a sangria which was awesome -- and I'm not a fan of tequila. Everyone said their food was delicious as well. The portions are good for the price you pay.   As for the games, there are TONS to choose from. They can get expensive fast, but this is typical nowadays. We spent about $25 each and got to play most of the games we wanted to. As usual, the rewards leave much to be desired, but that's not the reason you come to D&B's, is it?   All in all, we will return. Our server was very attentive and quick to get us whatever we needed."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place for the entire family.  Arcade, bowling, decent food, bar....a good way to cool off and have fun in this triple didget weather."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Took FOREVER to get our food. Had to track down our server to get our check. Never eating there again!"}
{"text":"No, I did not lose a bet I came here by choice.  My bad.  I thought it would be mildly entertaining, but it was sad.  Loud, stupid music. Crap games. Full of ass-clowns and kiddo's.  Run away! Run very far away!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this particular Dave and Busters. It is usually quieter then the one in Tempe. I know, I know....if I am coming here why am I looking for \"quiet\".   The games are all in working order and nice condition, they just added new ones, and for some reason my 2 year old has an uncanny knack for winning the ticket jackpots. Go figure.  The food is always really good, have the coronarita (but get it in strawberry it is DELICIOUS).  Dave and Busters is our go to place to meet up and do gift exchanged every year for Christmas with our friends. Its a tradition. I am really glad someone had the idea that arcades don't have to be dingy and can be for adults. Hello we all did grow up in the 80's right? (Well at least my generation did).  All in all, really like this place and if you sign up for the players card emails you get really great coupons."}
{"text":"I was super excited about getting to go check out the Dave and Buster's! My experience wasn't horrible, but there definitely were aspects that could have been better.   First of all, it was SUPER crowded. Probably because it's new and exciting, but I had to wait some time for a lot of the cooler games.   The place itself is nice and on a slower day, I could see it being really fun and enjoyable!   The ladies at the front counter where you purchase a play card were super friendly, but almost everyone in the bar area was either not so nice or just plain rude. --- We had a group of 10 that sat at a table at around 1:15am which I guess was cutting it close because the place closes at 2:00am, however we did ask the waitress if it was still okay to order food and drinks at that time. She said it was all right and took our orders pretty quickly. Our food came in almost 30 minutes and we ate pretty fast trying to keep in mind that they were closing soon. Our checks came at a little past 2:00am and we quickly paid and signed the receipts. At about 2:10am, one of the other employees (not our waitress) proceeds to come up to our group, asked if we closed out our checks, and then goes, \"Okay well we're closed.\"    I understand that the place was closed, but we had literally JUST given our waitress our checks. And on top of that, there was definitely more polite ways to ask us to leave...   That encounter definitely didn't leave me in a good mood and in those regards, I think the service could be better. Hopefully they'll get a better handle on it as time goes on, but based on tonight's service, a sour taste was left in my mouth."}
{"text":"Horrible over priced food. And then there's the staff.... We had our drinks refilled once, didn't see our waiter another ti,e at all, the cook brought our food out. When our check was brought to us, the waiter argued with us, yelled at us, and then stated that \"we just didn't understand how busy he was.\" But, we were the ONLY table in the section, and we watched him stand behind the bar the entire time and do nothing. It was my birthday, and this place ruined it. Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun and has good drinks. I understand this is a family place but also the company promotes it as a fun adult place which I don't feel it is. I wish they would do a cut off time with kids being there in general I know the rule is if there under 21 they need an adult which they always do. So now there parents there with small kids babies and teens passed midnight, it's always packed you can barley play games because the kids are all over the place. I was hoping it would be more fun getaway for adults but it's literally like a peter piper with alcohol."}
{"text":"Took family here and really wanted to have a positive experience. Unfortunately the poor ratings accurately reflect the food and service. We waited over an hour for our food, the manager finally brought it out and acted like we should be so appreciative that he personally brought it. It gets better, the food was so cold that the cheese on my nachos was solid, again the manager came over and stated it would take two minutes to make a new plate- not once did he offer a slight discount or an appetizer. Food was terrible but the service was worse. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I attended a Bobby Motta show here recently (show was great btw)! And was able to try out the drinks and games. I didn't order food. I had a snow cone drink which tested like diabetes in a glass. WAY too sweet for me. Also the crushed ice melted very quickly making the drink quite watery. My husband ordered a beer and was satisfied with the taste and price (though I suppose beer is beer). My drink was $8.95 - as were most of their fun drinks. Definitely wouldn't spend that again. A few of my friends ordered food. One who ordered a medium rare steak salad said it was tough, rubbery, overlooked and didn't even look appealing. Everyone else seemed pretty satisfied though (veggie burger, steak sandwich, etc). So perhaps the steak salad was just done poorly.  We were given an unlimited play card when we entered as part of our promo for going to the show. The card wasn't good for any of the games that gave tickets, but was still a fun way to try out various video games. I don't know if I would spend money to come here and hang out without a reason (like a show) but not a bad way to spend a Saturday. We definitely stayed longer than intended and had fun with the games. They're typical arcade fare so you know what you're getting :)"}
{"text":"Finally a Dave and busters in the West Valley! All the hype and after waiting I got to take my nieces for their first time. Walking in was confusing! The hostess just stares at you without direction on where to go for eating or for games. I walked In and had to ask which side was for what. The setting was different From the Dave and busters in Tempe. As expected you know it's going to come with some hiccups because of its grand opening. However, the food was pretty good and it did take a while for it to come out, but it wasn't bad service. My nieces enjoyed their first experience and even won the jackpot twice on one of the games getting over 2,000 tickets"}
{"text":"hahaha it's a pretty greaaaat place to go with some friends. grab some beer, play some games together and against each other, then when you're hungry you can grab some food (although you shouldn't expect to get amazing food here, I mean, you shouldn't be here for the games anyway)  what else would you need?  hahahaha the prizes also really suck unless you really save up over multiple times, the only worthwhile prizes are like 15,000+ tickets, and you'll probably get around 2000 for ~$50 of credit, so don't come here to win prizes.  I think it's a great place if you come for the right reasons and have your expectations in check."}
{"text":"Worst food area ever. They tell you 45 min to 1 hr but it ends up being 2 hours almost 2 and 1/2. They didn't tell us the tables in front of the bar are free for all. The host don't care nor the managers.  The host are super young and don't care. I talk to a manager about it and they just blow me off and tell me it's busy. Of course it's busy it's a Friday but that is no excuse for their terrible service. I was wondering why other people were leaving bad review and I see why. I was literally  passed off so much I was cussing at the manager just so he gets the point. I would never eat their again. Rather eat somewhere else then just drink and play games.  I warn you now!!! DO NOT EAT HERE. FOOD IS OK BUT SERVICE SUCKS!!!! If I could leave no stars I would. I don't think the food area should be in business. With all these other reviews please understand how bad it is. Just eat somewhere else then just drink because your never going to get a table when they say."}
{"text":"I just went to D&B's in Myrtle Beach, so I have to compare my experiences.  We took a walk around before deciding to sit &  eat. It was a madhouse & several games we were interested in were out of order. We were seated promptly after approaching the hostess stand. My menu was smothered in sour cream or something & it got all over my hand & the table. The waitress apologized.   We ordered - my husband got the Cabo chicken & I got the steak salad (with no pecans or tomatoes) - the waitress asked for clarification about the pecans & tomatoes. So we waited.....and waited.....and waited. After 40 minutes, we finally got our food & guess what was on my salad - pecans & tomatoes. I didn't bother to bring it to her attention because we had already waited so long. I just sat & picked them all out.   When she brought the check, there was no indication that she even informed the kitchen that I asked for the pecans, etc. to be withheld.  The broccoli that came with my husband's meal was cold & his chicken was bland & chewy. My salad was tolerable, minus the fact that it had some less than desirable looking lettuce in it - which I just picked out & placed in a pile on the table (and later cleaned up).  I just couldn't get over having to wait for 40 minutes to get a wrong order & cold sides.  We ended up not even getting to use our game card but on 2 games because we had to leave.   Definitely not a great experience. Maybe ok if you just want to play some games."}
{"text":"Food is meh but the customer service you get makes up for the substandard food. We used to go every Wednesday but have stopped due to the fact that we literally have every prize that is there so it makes it less fun. Change out your prizes(just a suggestion)."}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so many negatives reviews for this place. I love the games here and half price Wednesday is amazing. It's a place for games and there are a lot of games to choose from. No complaints. I would suggest signing up for their email rewards so that you can benefit from their extra promotion. They also recently added more machines. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Dave & Buster's locations. I went for the Wednesday half price games. Played for 3 hours on $50, not bad. There were very few games out of service compared to other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"This is my \"home\" Dave & Busters location. Its fun, cheap to play, and I always leave with a decent prize. The staff is always super nice and accommodating. Only let down is the lack of security and the fact that about one fifth of the games were broken or out of service on my last visit."}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible here. Most of the games were broken and every card machine to reload money on the card has some sort of issue."}
{"text":"I don't know when I've hated a place more.  Seriously, I think I'd rather endure Chuck E. Cheese.  In fairness, I was in a crappy mood before I got here, but even a couple beers didn't help.  Rip off, crappy food--and the worst bar service I've ever experienced.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"Fun games!!!! Terrible customer service!!! Came in about 30 mins after they opened on a Sunday, the lady at the front desk was angry and unfriendly right off the bat!!! There were about 3 people in front of me,all of a sudden she screams at all of us as if we were in trouble, that the kiosk is faster. Everyone on front of me ran off. So I was left standing and she looks at me and says you can go to the kiosk, I said will it take my coupon in my email, she says no, and continues to do whatever it is that she is so consumed by on the register. Then she in a very loud and obnoxious voice\"hello\" and I just went up did the transaction, I never said a word!!! I tried to be calm because I was with my children. She was rude as hell!!!! So I went an found the manager and let him know that I did not appreciated this employee being such a jerk for no reason!!! And she better be glad that God was reminding me of my manners that day!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant in Las Vegas I will never be ordering food here again"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!    A FAMILY GATHERING!    A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!    OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!  A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!  The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.    The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.  The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.  Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure.   WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.    POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.    A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games.   Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!    DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!  FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!"}
{"text":"This location is definitely alot better for family fun , the layout is great, it's well lit in lighting , the games are plentiful , but I hope they get better food service cooks .  My goodness we waited 15 minutes for a waiter , had to go to hostess stand and ask who was serving our area . Then we proceeded to wait more than an hour for our food , after telling the manager . The food was ok, typical bar food or simple dishes , our grilled wings were cold so I'm not sure why... but we were hangry so we ate them . The kids grilled cheese surprisingly was the fav at the table , it was texas toast grilled cheese heaven   What made this night better and the long wait on the food not so intolerable  was the server and the manager cared about our experience so we were gifted two gamer cards to enjoy the remainder of our evening . I think with a few more months all the kinks will be worked out at this location  , hopefully."}
{"text":"It seems like most of the reviews here are for the food. However, I just came in for the games and had a blast. My partner and I came in for the power hour and thoroughly enjoyed my time playing all the arcade games. However, it felt a bit lacking and we felt restricted with the amount of games we can play. Therefore, we chose to throw down and got a refillable power card to play to our  hearts content.  Boy oh boy was it fun. It got to play every single game we could. We did come across a few games that were eating our tokens but that seems to be a problem in all Dave and Busters. All in all, I had a blast and would definitely return. Would I come to power hour? Probably not. Would I return to half off Wednesday's? Oh hell yes. We played $12 worth of games and came out with 3 bags of gummy bears. I'll consider that a win in my books."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple of years. I like the location in Hawaii most of all, as it has a better set up with the games and hey, it's Hawaii. Dave and busters, where you can pay $3,000 to earn enough tickets for an Apple Watch!"}
{"text":"No, no, no.  Firstly, the facility is beautiful and everyone I encountered was friendly, if a little too overbearing. (I swear, our waiter was at our table every 3-5 minutes, interrupting our conversation to check on us and ask a question.  Enough with the check-ins already, give us some time to dine uninterrupted!)  Secondly, I sat down and my menu is sticky and wet and that set the tone for a less than stellar experience.  What I take away when I encounter a sticky, wet menu is that at some recent point someone wiped it down with a wet towel but they didn't get it fully clean. or dry, so they did a crap job overall; and I'm about to dine here. Yay.  Lastly, the food came and I was horribly disappointed.  I ordered the Lobster Alfredo with Shrimp and a 5\" Petite Filet.   That's a lot of high end items on my fettuccini for $18.99 so I expected a pretty decent lunch.  Sadly it wasn't good at all.  The pasta wasn't hot and wasn't cold, it was...tepid?  The presence of lobster was non-existent in the weak flavored pasta sauce.  (Perhaps they waived a piece of lobster over the sauce as it was cooking? That's the only possible explanation.) The shrimp were on the ragged edge of being undercooked, too soft to the touch and still lightly translucent in places, a telltale sign of being underdone.  And finally, one half of my petite filet was nothing but sinewy tendons, leaving me all of 2.5\" of meat for my lunch; that annoyed me because I'm a girl that likes her meat.  (TWSS!)   My 9 year old son ordered the kid's mac and cheese for $4.99 from the kid's menu and received...wait for it...a bowl of lukewarm Kraft mac and cheese and nothing more.  Not a small side of fruit, or fries, or anything else to lessen the insult that I just dropped $5 on a small bowl of mac and cheese that would cost me less than fifty cents to buy at the store and get enough to serve the whole family.  Ah, but I forget that I am paying for the ambience of this place: sticky menus, and incessant interruptions, and all!!  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries for $3.99 for my 4 year old daughter and her food was the only thing that was good about the whole dining experience!  And don't even get me started on the price of the games at this place.  The word exorbitant comes to mind.  Nah, my experience here was no good.  My dining partner's experience was no better, having ordered a Chinese Salad that came generously mixed with finely diced kale, when she despises kale and it wasn't listed as an ingredient in the salad on the menu.  She spoke to a manager and got her horrid salad removed from her bill.  I just sucked it up and paid my bill in full and felt queasy all day long after eating one of those undercooked shrimp.  :/"}
{"text":"I stopped by D&B's after an incredible brunch and relaxing day at the mall. Figured some games and more drinks would cap off a perfect day. Parking here was tough but I get it, it was a Saturday night. Particularly an NFL playoff bound night and although I no longer watch the NFL, the bar was flooded with fans. When my date and I arrived, it was too busy to be greeted by a host so we came in and looked for seating at the bar.   The set up is confusing so when we finally saw seating for two we proceeded via the quickest route. Unfortunately and unknowingly, we walked through an employee's only area at the foot of what appears to be a wrap around bar. We were alerted of such nicely by a young lady about 3/4ths of the way through and I apologized and proceeded since we were at this point a couple steps from our seats.   What happened after that I've never experienced at any business, anywhere. Another young lady, said aloud \"See, that's what the f*ck I'm talking about....\" while clapping her hands and staring us down.   Bad day? Possibly. But to deliberately ensure the customers at your job hear you use expletives out of anger is completely unacceptable. If multiple people have been walking through there recently it's very possible, someone needs to mandate the area or larger signs need to be placed in that area. I admit we were in the wrong but we didn't know better as we were not informed til we were practically finished walking through.   Ashley, tall dark skinned lady with braids, saved the night with her friendliness and attentiveness to my date's allergens. My date loved both drinks when ingredients were substituted and I enjoyed mine as well. Ashley checked on us periodically through the night although it was packed and demand was extremely high.  Drinks are priced at about $10 or so a piece, the menus do not have pricing so you are hoping for the best when you receive your tab. Final bill was $50 with 4 drinks and an appetizer. Although it's close to Ballantyne where I reside, I'm about 100% sure I wouldn't return as the price is steep and obviously some of the staff need customer service training. I'll continue to take the 25 minute drive to Palmer Street when in the mood for drinks and video games. Two thumbs down over here."}
{"text":"Had a gift card and decided to check it out. All I can say is its like Chuck E. Cheese on steroids lol! Never seen so many games in one building. Food was off the hook. I had Tennessee hot chicken. Funny I'm from Tennessee and never heard if it until recently. My boyfriend had chicken n shrimp Alfredo. All very good. Then off to the games. Your game money is loaded onto a card as well as the tickets you've won. Not allot of extra stuff to keep up with. I like the card idea. I traded in my tickets earned on 2 bracelets. It was those glitter filled bracelets like we wore in the 80s. Ha Ha Ha! Will come back."}
{"text":"The garlic mashed potatoes had way too much garlic (and trust me, I love garlic), and the pepperoni pretzel pull aparts were oily and difficult to bite into. The brookie sundae tower tasted fine and was fun to share, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Very average menu."}
{"text":"This is a two part review.  Part one - Restaurant:  We were seated right away and given our menus. We were a table of five and had all decided what we wanted to eat long before the server greeted us. We actually waited quite some time for our server. When she finally greeted us, she asked if we had been served yet. Confused, we said no. She then told us she didn't know what happened to our server (uh, what?) so she would be our server instead. She was very friendly and upbeat so it wasn't all bad. We put in our orders right away and waited.   And waited.   It seemed like forever until we finally got our food.   I got just a regular cheeseburger off a recommendation from our server. I had originally asked for a different dish but our server suggested (while mentioning that she probably shouldn't tell me this) that I get something else as my first choice didn't come highly recommended. I appreciated her honesty.   My burger was fine. Nothing special. The fries were super salty though and I couldn't finish them. Two people at the table got the shrimp and chicken alfredo, but there was no shrimp in it! We mentioned this to the server at the end and she offered us a free dessert. We misunderstood and thought she said we could all get dessert. Since we misunderstood, she still gave us three desserts for free. Very nice of her.   Overall, the food was just alright. Nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the long wait. We even waited an extremely long time for our dessert!  Part two - Games:   My favourite part of D&B has always been the selection of games. Okay, I lied. My favourite part of D&B has always been the fact that you can grab a drink at the bar and bring it with you while you play games.   It should be noted that drinks at the bar are expensive. I got a pint of Bud Light and it was over $9. A crappy beer like that should never cost that much!  There's a pretty good selection of games. Of course, I managed to find a game that didn't work when I swiped my card. Staff was quick to come by and look into the game and give me free play on a different game of my choice.  Overall, a very fun experience, but the slow service at the restaurant and the insanely high price for beer is what warrants only 3 stars."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. The ONLY reason I would ever come back to this Dave & Buster's is to play the games. Not only did it take us thirty minutes of waiting by the bar waving anyone down, when we finally did, her expression said, \"I'm miserable and I don't want to be here\" and she had a terrible attitude. On top of that, she was very slow from start to finish; it probably took her fifteen minutes from the moment she took our ID's to finally getting the drink bill. Mind you, all of this without any sort of nice interaction. Also, the drinks were shitty. I just paid $11 for a Long Island Iced Tea filled with ice and barely any alcohol, if I'm paying $11 for a drink, it should at least be worth it. After playing games, we made the mistake of sitting down and eating as well. It was all just the same. Waitress with a bad attitude and not helpful when you asked her about the food (a friend asked if the wings were spicy because she does not like spicy food, waitress waved it off as \"not overly spicy\", when in fact they were too spicy and my friend could not eat them). The food also took forever to come out, and the waitress never asked us how our food was after we got it (which it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good). Moral of the story: management needs to get their employees in line. Please eat and drink at any other restaurants at West Gate and only go to D&B's for the games, I know that's what I will be doing from now on."}
{"text":"What a rip off!!!! Spent 180.00 in cards to find out that they lasted about  15 min ... also the combo packages are confusing especially when you are trying to hear how they work from the hostess at the door and the music is so loud - I never was clear on how they work.... kids did enjoy the prizes, however service was HORRIBLE! We sat at our table a good 15 min without a greeting or acknowledgement. My husband ordered our beer from the bar... finally we got ahold of our server...asked for a pitcher of soda, they brought us this huge cylinder of soda that we drank half of it, then tried to charge us 30.00!! FOR SODA? I will never visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually come here for the games (which we love coming here for). This place is definitely known for their games with a large assortment to choose from. But this time.. we came yesterday to have lunch and wanted to play afterwards. The service started off rocky when we sat at the booth near the bar. It's basically \"seat yourself\" with menus at the table and the server is suppose to come and greet you. Only prob was that there was no server to be found. We waited about ten min (in an almost empty restaurant with only one group that was having their Christmas party and another group of four people at another table). After ten minutes of looking around for our server.. I wanted to leave but my boyfriend insisted to give them another try and sit at the bar counter this time. We practically moved a few feet from the booth to the counter.   As we were sitting down, we were immediately greeted by the bartender who asked for our drink orders. He saw we had an appetizer voucher and asked us if he would like to put in our order for the appetizer while we were looking at the menus. We ordered the nachos for the appetizer and two mojitos to start. Because we never really ordered food here (especially because there were specials on the menu if you order a dish with $20 play), the bartender helped us order and answered any questions we had. We decided to order from the specials- I ordered the mac & cheese & my boyfriend ordered the caveman (consisting of sliders, BBQ ribs, & fries) along with the $20 game play as well. The food came out hot and delicious.   We both were really impressed and happy with the service after having a rough start in the beginning. Our bartender came by to check in on us frequently. We'll definitely be back to try other food & drinks on the menu.. but one thing we agreed is to only sit at the bar if you want great service."}
{"text":"The place is fun, but the staff is absolutely miserable! I honestly think they put work into the amount of anger the possess....for example after waiting 10 minutes to be seated because no one was stopping by the hostess stand I ask a server politely \"hello, how do we get seated tonight?\" I get a reply \"that's called a Hostess\" as they run away from me. Manager refused to help me with my coupon, other staff completely judging me for no reason. It's really pathetic how bad it's gotten. They need a complete restructure and employees who want to work hard and possess quality work. This location is far worse than the U.S. locations for exactly this reason. I feel like I was treated worse than dog shit at Dave & Busters Toronto tonight and for this reason I have decided to end my 20 year relationship with this establishment. I will only visit them while in the US from now on where they care about me....."}
{"text":"Jillian's has a lot going on.  I think the main attraction is the arcade- it's filled with tons of games-even some you can ride. But for those that like to drink, Jillian's offers plenty of opportunity.  From the downstairs bar to the upstairs nightclub, you can get smashed and then go out and race your friend on some motorcycle game or challenge each other in a rousing game of skee ball.  I recommend the nightclub. While there's usually no one in it, they have fantastic drink specials (when I went, they had $1 martinis) and the DJ will play anything you ask.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have to laugh, this place not so great ratings. Greeted at the front area by a chubby  little round face something. I was carrying my alkaline water bottle and she raised her voice I cant bring that in. I tried to explain it was alkaline and she said they serve water at the bar. She got the manager, then metro showed up. Wow all I can say. I am a person that follows rules. I was just wanting to have my water. They got me a glass so I could pour the water in. I took my water bottle to my car. We ate here, food was what I expected, just okay but thats okay. No disappointment. The server was sweet."}
{"text":"My server nina was exceptionally nice and helpful. She had a beautiful smile. Attended to my every need. Even floor manager. I will come baxk again for just the service alone."}
{"text":"This D&B is like any other but I am just not impressed with games that constantly cheat you out of tickets and nasty bathrooms.   CROWD AND WAIT TIME (5 stars!): For being in such a popular area, the crowd wasn't too bad on a holiday from noon-3ish. The most we had to wait to play ticket games was 1 person. Not bad at all.   STAFF (5 stars!): 5 stars for the wonderful staff! The bartender was friendly even though we just wanted waters the whole time, the techs were awesome and we saw them the most because the coin games were being jerks. The prize clerks were actually friendly rather than the \"I hate life\" clerks we have found at other locations.  COIN GAMES CHEATING YOU OUT OF TICKETS ( -1 million stars): So half of the coin games that were actually working get 0 stars because if you don't constantly continue feeding the 10 coins you pay for then it thinks nobody is there making it hard for the slower strategic players. When too much time passes between the play of a coin and the time coins fall then it won't give credit for the win/tickets. The techs told us that this is so D&B doesn't shell out tickets for gravity doing its job aka those awesome random coin falls. This makes D&B a real DB! Getting random tickets for ghost falls was always part of the fun of those machines. If a coin falls, someone, anyone deserves to get the tickets, especially when your screwing players out of their actually earned tickets. FIX YOUR MACHINES!  Players: 1. always ask for help when you notice you're not getting tickets for coin falls. 2. always make sure you get 10 coins per swipe. Every machine we went to had 2 or 3 get stuck. The techs will help you every time.  NASTY BATHROOMS (0 stars): 0 stars for the nastiest bathrooms in the Waterfront. This must be a D&B thing because every D&B bathroom I've entered smells like urine, toilets are nasty, exposed feminine products stare you in the face not 1 foot away from where you pee (I don't want to see a used anything thank you), and either there is not enough soap dispensers or they've run out of paper towels. Don't forget the overflowing trashcan. There's a lot of people going in and out, D&B needs to clean their bathrooms every hour or 2."}
{"text":"This place deserve half a star. Came in for a appetizer.  At 335pm we didn't get anything until 430.  I got my onions rings with no dipping sauces no ketchup or ranch or bleu cheese nothing.  Who eat onion rings just plain. I don't know of anyone.  Horrible service, 45 minutes for onion rings really. It's not like the place is pack it's empty. They need to get their shit together if the want to stay a business. We Lasvegas people expect fast service. Ten minutes should be long enough on a empty restaurant for onions rings with no sauce maybe 13 if you would bring some to dip my onions ring."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years and was anticipating a positive experience with all of the changes. HOWEVER, the service was horrible. We waited at least an hour between appetizer and meal rounds. When the food came, the wings were cold. The waitress continuously reached over my face to put things on and things off the table and was not accommodating. We would ask for refills and never receive them and our order was messed up. I was highly disappointed and dissatisfied. I will not be back. Piss poor performance. The bathrooms were also horrible. You can tell they are not regularly maintained. Understanding Saturday's are busy, this is no excuse for an establishment of this magnitude."}
{"text":"Prior to this experience, I had never been to a Dave & Buster's before. I had always heard such great things, so I came into it with pretty high expectations. To be honest, I was fully disappointed in this D&B experience. This doesn't mean I'm not going to return to D&B ever again, I'm just simply stating some things that could be improved at this particular location.   The concept of D&B is awesome - alcohol, food, arcade games. I'm so into that.   They use a modern concept where you load money on to a game card and in order to play the game, you just slide the card in a game slot. Games were a little bit on the pricier end. But I didn't really mind. It was my first time here, and I was willing to pay for some damn, good arcade games.   It was a Thursday night, so I expected it to be a bit busier. Thursdays are the new Friday after all. It was definitely busy. But not to the point where you couldn't play a game or walk around.   Speaking of games, more than half of them were out of order! This made it extremely hard for my cousin, brother and I to all play together, which was a huge bummer. Even skeeball, which is my favourite arcade game of all time was out of order! HOW?! Since plenty of the games were out of order, a lot of people were just wandering around. As a side effect, this also formed huge lines for the games that were working. Which at that point, it wasn't really worth it to wait in a line.   We decided to head over to the restaurant side to feed our hungry bellies. There was about a 10-15 minute wait, no biggie. When our table was ready, we were sent a text. God bless, modern technology. We were sat in a large booth for the 3 of us and quickly ordered food.   They have a huge menu with your typical pub fare - burgers, sandwiches, fun appetizers, etc. We got nachos to start. For my main I got the chicken strips and yam fries. Our server was friendly, but the service itself took forever. I'm usually very patient and understanding, given my industry background, but I was genuinely surprised and unimpressed with how long our food took. We were fairly hungry, so that didn't help fuel the flame. We placed our order around 9:30 and our nachos didn't even come out till a little after 10:15. 45 minutes for nachos? Our server came over and apologized and said that our dishes were being rushed out.   The nachos itself were just alright. Fantastic that it came fully loaded and there weren't a lot of necessary add-ons. Meat, guac, and salsa already came with it. But it was simply mediocre. It wasn't really warm, which gives me the idea that it might have been sitting for a while. But at that point, we didn't care. We were just hungry.   When our mains came out, it was another 25-30 minutes after we got our nachos. My chicken tenders were hard and weirdly chewy. The sauce that paired with it was quite tasty, though. By the time our main meals came out though, we weren't as hungry as we were before, so I barely finished my dish.   I mean, D&B overall is an awesome concept. But there could definitely be some necessary improvements. Maybe it was just this particular location, but to be honest, it was a big disappointment.   I hope my next D&B experience is better than my first!"}
{"text":"Such a great location and atmosphere for food and games. I love how there are different sections such as the arcade area, bowling area, dining area, etc. There are many different arcade game choices. Great spot for kids to enjoy as well as adults. I have yet tried the food but the menu looks great. I've had a sangria which was tasty but a bit on the pricy side but what can you expect with the location and entertainment. Definitely a great spot for dates, group dates, and family time. This is a great concept and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to eat and had the displeasure of having a waitress that walked away halfway through our order being placed. She was texting on her phone when I was giving my order as well and looks at me as if I am distracting her. The food arrived almost 40 minutes later when I was ready to walk out. My burger was cold and the Nashville fried chicken was so small for the price. Tasted like cardboard. We never got a refill on our iced teas at all. Never going back again."}
{"text":"We planned a 21st birthday celebration here and the birthday guest was denied service after they were told they would be allowed. One of the guests in our party had to wait the entire meal to get there food and when we cancelled it they brought it out and the only thing that was done was the one meal was taken off our check. We also had some guest who ordered some alcoholic drink which tasted of no alcohol. The way the management team handled the situation felt like they didn't take the matter seriously and had no empathy for the situation."}
{"text":"I think they have a nice place over here. Great service. Wednesday half off of game play. Good deal for kids to have some fun."}
{"text":"First off, im not sure why this D&B has so many negative reviews for the waiting time to be seated! They just recently opened people!!! They are super busy and there is a lot of people inside!! How can they seat everyone at the same time, they cant make people eat/drink fast just so you can be seated sooner! Anyways, my husband and I went to D&B yesterday afternoon. It was packed with people! We knew it would be busy given the fact that they just opened not too long ago. Before starting to play some of the games, we decided to get the buzzer for the eating area because they looked busy! The wait was 15-30 minutes to be seated. The game selection was great and we did not really have to wait long for any of the games. After playing for about 20 minutes our buzzer turned on, we went to be seated. Our waitress was accommodating, there was a lot of waiters/waitresses, more than we were used to. It took awhile for our appetizer to come out, we ordered the nachos, they were very good!! Soon after our meal was ready. I had the linguine pasta with shrimp and steak over lobster Alfredo sauce, it was delicious!!! My husband had something else, not sure what it was but it tasted good! lol it was a fun place!!"}
{"text":"I was sort of overwhelmed walking in. I understand that it is a fusion of food and fun, but it seems that the food component dominates. As you walk through the building towards the arcade, there are multiple little food \"neighbourhoods\" that you pass through. Even in the arcade, there is a large bar and multiple seating areas. What I wondering while walking through was whether each separate eating area was serving a different style of food. I don't think thats the case though- I am pretty confident that the food is all the same.   About the arcade: Its not too bad. There is not a huge selection of games to play because, like I said before, the damn place is so dominated by food. A lot of the generally more popular games (racing, table hockey, basketball) are alway being used. I found myself waiting a lot...Pricewise, you can REALLY spend a lot of money here. I spent about $25 for myself on credit and it lasted me about 1 hour of conservative playing but I know people can easily blow $50-$100 in credit in one night. Once my credit was finished, I went to cash in my credit and what was I able to afford? 3 laffy taffys...yay me. Is it worth it to come here? Yes, come check out the place. You may find a machine you really like and spend some time on it, you may find some throwback games from your chuck-e-cheese days. However, I would not say its a place to go every weekend. You will surely go broke within time lol.   I am giving it 4 stars because they are obviously good at what they do. A lot of people show up and there is ample space for eating and drinking (perhaps, a little bit too much?). What would have made this better for me would be some billiard tables, but there are none at this location.   Anyways, It was my first time visiting, and I don't hate the place. But I probably wont be here for another while."}
{"text":"Games and Food. You got to separate them. Let's start with the food. It's like a Friday's, Chili's, etc. I think this is a spot where DnB can stand above the rest, but they don't. It's the same food, and it just \"decent.\" Good Happy Hour specials. It's loud but they have a lot of tvs, lots of space for big groups, and a great place for buddies to meet up after work.  The games place is more spacious than the Concord location. Room to breath. Not as dark. The games are pretty much the same but you don't feel squeezed in there. Weekends are filled with kids. Go on a weekday to avoid lots and lots of kids. DnB is known to take advantages from good players. So they drop jackpots or toughen games. So don't go here expecting to rack up 50,000 tickets for $50. They make the games tough.  The prize area needs a lot of help. This is not the location's fault. This is all chosen by corporate. But the prizes are poor. Too much junk, horrible candy and the turnover on prizes is low. So they often hold prizes for 2+ years. Also, things like the Amazon Echo are the older version.   Summary: Place is new as I write this. Avoid weekends. Weeknights are good. Go with friends. Have a friendly competition of who can win the most tickets."}
{"text":"My dad and I had some bad feelings about this location just because it's small. Thankfully, Buffalo Wild Wings was rude and overcrowded so we went to D&B instead.  Best move ever; not only are the wings exponentially better, but we were sat right away and had Heather as the best server we could've hoped for. Everything came out in a timely manner but she was never rushed and we enjoyed many many conversations with her. She's a very sweet girl & we'll be back just to see her."}
{"text":"It's a entertainment, Sport bar, Arcade centre. It's also freaking huge.  I'm from Montreal and there's some arcade centre, but nothing similar to Dave & Buster's. It's a Arcade where you can get those tickets which you can use for Arcade games or prizes.  There's lot and I mean A LOT of different arcades for everytype of addicts. I got 2837 ticket with 30$ worth of Ticket which is a lot. I already got a \"system\" for the next time I go by Toronto :)"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the game play. Coming here on a regular day....$23 will last you 20-30 minutes. Coming here on half play Wednesdays, $23 will get you 60-75 minutes if you play fairly liberally with your points. The games here are all fairly standard, they're fun for date night. I would love to partake in ongoing half play wednesdays with a group of friends.   Who knows, maybe we'll try the fries and shakes one of these days. The bowling could be fun too! I believe you play for half off too!"}
{"text":"Gaming area was fun, but obviously pretty expensive. I think $50 for 300 chips? Games usually range from 2-10 chips.  My boyfriend and I decided to sit in the bar area after we were done playing games for better service. We did not get greeted for a while. I just wanted one order of wings. My server specifically told me I could get fries or salad with that, so my boyfriend and I were under the impression that it was a free side. She ended up charging us $5 for the salad alongside with my wings. She was MIA the whole time and came back and told us she was really busy. She did not smile at all. Possibly the worst service ever. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place but first things first the food and bowling are not the realest. The food is overpriced (same with the bowling) and definitely not worth the price. The food just wasn't good and there a million other bowling alley's in Charlotte that would be worth the price.  Now the games are amazing and there are so many to choose from! Even better is they often get new games so every time I go I'm impressed that there are different/new games to play (they have a Star Wars game currently. My only complaint is that amount of children in this place even super late into the evening.   Pro Tip: Go on Wednesday evenings during the school year when kids are hopefully in bed and when the games are half off."}
{"text":"Not really sure what to add.  So I'll bullet point my experience.  - Expensive poorly made drinks - Friendly but slow service - Ok food considering (Had the Philly Steak and Cheese) - Over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision - 15% of the games were out of order (Air Hockey, Big Bball Game, 1/2 of the skee ball, random other arcade machines) - Expensive games - Fun time overall with the wife."}
{"text":"We had never dined at Dave and Busters, we entered with a little apprehension. I had heard enough about the \"theme\" to be ok considering what the restaurant was \"known\" for. I will agree with a friend that it is like an \"adult\" Chuck E Cheese it does have that appearance. Yet, it is more -- we were pleasantly surprised.  The food, while not much different than an upscale pub also had traces of a wild wings, and yes the adult arcade. Nancy had the Teriyaki Steak and it was scrumptious  I had a burger. The burger was as expected. It was reasonably priced and yes loud. Again, we were pleasantly surprised and a good night out. It is not someplace we would regularly visit .... but a nice change of pace and a little unique."}
{"text":"I've heard of Dave & Buster's but going to one is quite an experience! I had an early dinner with two young men who were just as happy to gawk at all the screens and games as I was that evening. We were seated right away and the server was patient with all of our questions about the different game cards and deals. He even came and found us when our food was up so that we could play games after we ordered. We will be back but plan for a longer period of time to play. This place is like a casino for kids so be mindful of the money being spent as their game cards are like credit cards and it is hard to know how much you are really spending!  It is a wonderful evening of entertainment for all ages though and I can see myself returning during football season to enjoy all the large screens around the bar."}
{"text":"I seriously love Dave and Buster's! Everytime I have been here it was a great time! I love playing so many of the games. My top favorites are Pac Man and Mario Kart. I love that nearly all the games are multiplayer. I have never been here on a weekend (I work weekends) but I assume that it gets very busy. When I come, there are a lot of people but there is always a different game to play. I have ate the restaurant only once. My husband and I had shared this pasta dish with steak as a quick snack before going to play. It was yummy and I do remember the service being great. I will continue to come back and encouraging others to do so. :)"}
{"text":"I've literally been waiting for the waiter to ask for my drinks for 25 minutes. I had to place my order and my drinks at the bar so I could get any service. This place sucks and it barely started :/"}
{"text":"The games are VERY old and many of them last for like 20-40 sec. The food is REALLY bad! The drinks are lees than ok, my Ceaser was bad but other people said their drinks were fine. The place looks old and dirty (my general feeling).  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AFTER BEING THERE 3 TIMES (not by my choice)."}
{"text":"If you're in the arcade and try really hard to get served... if and when you do get them, the service is painfully slow. The drinks are watered down. But the place mind bogglingly busy...  got the \"mountain of nachos last time and they were microwaved mush... the video games are expensive and the ticket games go fast, pay out little and are expensive... if you don't have minors just go to the casino...."}
{"text":"Hmph...I guess, for a weekday (Thursday)...and maybe they weren't expecting a busy night, so that would explain the time it took for a server to finally show up to our table. We weren't all there at the same time, either...my son and I first, then my sister, and finally my daughter and her family. I'm sure they were busy, or otherwise distracted. We only ordered a bunch of appetizers and a meal each too...hey, thats a lot of hassle and bother. Kids running around, parents chasing after, spend a lot of money...hey, well that means little or less.  Keep it up folks...and less, then less will stop by. Your staff does not care at all.  Not. A. Bit."}
{"text":"Last minute get together to celebrate my buddies birthday and all he's about is playing games. What better way then get everyone (adults and kids) together stress-free at the last minute and get some good food, cocktails and most importantly play some games. Eat & Drink first and the games shall follow.   When I learned I was coming, I did what everyone else probably does, reaches into that shoebox or kitchen drawer of game cards from years ago hoping to find some magical points, tickets or money loaded to extend the night. I had 6 cards....   We were undecided on the apps, so we went with the Fives All Around which included 5 of everything (Chicken Wings, Chicken Quesadilla with what I think was salsa and then these 5 Pretzel hot dogs and pretzel pieces that actually were pretty good)  When it comes to dinner the best bang for your buck are the eat & play combos. I went with the Caveman Combo which included ribs, sliders, and fries while others ventured with the Crispy Nashville Hot chicken or took the healthy route with the grilled chicken and kale salad. As far as cocktails, I stuck with my Mule (which was good) and the birthday boy went with the Green Ghost (Crown & apple whiskey) in which it comes with a green glowing cube (that we kept) followed by the Strawberry Watermelon Margarita (which also had a glow cube in it). The drinks were good but more entertaining if you ask me. Then again, when we shifted to games, I think that's when it all kicked it... the liquor that is...   Variety of games are cool and you will find yourself swiping like crazy when it comes to games that say \"you have 10 seconds to continue\"... Overall experience can be fun, a bit pricey, but where else can you find an 8ft Rock'em Sock em game deliverying blows."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. I wish it was closer by to where I lived. The food is amazing as well as priced right. If you get the combo (dinner and games) it works very well. All the menu items that I have tried have tasted great. Even the milkshake tastes very good which is rare.   It is a noisy place and there are a lot of kids running around during the day and ladies wearing over the top outfits after 8pm. That being said, it is great for taking your kids as well as taking a date. If you can't have fun here, you can't have fun anywhere.   Just don't look at the price for the games, they are insanely high.   Don't forget to count up your tickets when you are done!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice. Seems smaller than the D&B in Scottsdale but maybe bcz it's only 1 story. Also no lanes here, no bowling. Many big tvs is nice!"}
{"text":"F*ck you, Dave. And f*ck you, Buster.   FOOD & DRINKS: Same deep fried shit and beers you can get anywhere.  GAMES: $1-1.5 per arcade game.  \"1 Credit to play\" or \"1 Swipe to Play\" language as a f*ck you to adolescents and teens who can't divide in a state which ranks 51st in education in the Union. Case in point: the attendant couldn't tell me how many tokens each dollar is worth. 70 tokens for $14.  $2 f*ck you charge to buy their mandatory charge card which McKinsey advised them to implement to up profits (decrease machine breakdowns and additional bank fees associated with large coin deposits and withdrawals).  SERVICE:  Like a strip club. If you're not lighting benjamins, you're treated like a waste of space."}
{"text":"We came in after my nieces dance show..there was a long wait and the hostess said bar booths were Open seating..we found one. bree was our server and she was so nice! Ryan the manager came by and checked on us and made sure everything was good! Loved our experience! Kids had a blast"}
{"text":"I ordered a steak dinner and they forgot the steak! It was good food nonetheless. The bathrooms were disgusting, but it was an ok night."}
{"text":"Terrible ... Terrible service .  My bf took me for a late date on Valentine's there . Server was too busy having fun talking than taking our order .My food came an hour late incomplete.  My Bfs food never arrived . The worst day ever . I will never return back . I hope this people will get fired soon , being a server myself this kind of service is the worst nightmare."}
{"text":"You gotta give it some credit for the drinks and games. But every single employee has the worst customer service skills that you could encounter for a decent bar/food/gaming facility. Atmosphere that they create for consumers is horrible."}
{"text":"First time here. Really enjoyed it. Good food great atmosphere,  and good variety of games for adults and kids. Will definitely be back with the family."}
{"text":"You're either going to have the best service of your life or you're going to sit at the bar for an hour waiting for your quesadilla to come out. There is no in between yet 4,000 tickets later I still come back. I see no fun in the casino so Dave and Busters is my adult casino that still makes me nostalgic about my childhood. I enjoy the hoops game,  the top 40 music,  the yummy eats and most of their cocktail menu is pretty darn impressive. I always go for the Passion Fruit Sangria or the Backwoods lemonade that comes with a shot in a mini Solo Cup. They can be pricey after a while that's why I show up for happy hour. If you're into gaming do show up on a Wednesday where all games are half off."}
{"text":"Place was smaller than expected, service was horrible! Went last night about midnight, I understand they were closing soon but there was seriously 2 other people there on a Saturday night. We lost my friend for a while, only to find her sick in the bathroom 30 min later. As soon as we did we prepared to leave since they were closing I asked the guy with glasses standing in front of the bathroom with his 2 cop security guards if it was still ok for me to use the restroom since they were about to close. He told me yeah only if you don't mess it up!........... lmao what!? That's how you talk to PAYING customers? I was excited about Dave and Busters coming to Vegas, after this I'd rather hang out with the kids at John's Incredible Pizza."}
{"text":"They don't have their Mac n cheese anymore!!! I'm pregnant and was craving it! It's still on the menu... I order it and was told they no longer have it. WHYYYYYY would you take the best thing off your menu?!"}
{"text":"*wahhhh They removed the ticket dispensers. Now it saves to your card.  But honestly, the excitement of having the tickets spit out and holding how much youve earned was like 90% of the fun.  Now the experience is kinda dull.    I understand its more convenient and practical this way, but its less exciting.  Plus the machines are often having difficulty reading the card or the game doesnt play properly or it takes credits from your card but the game doesn't play."}
{"text":"Noise galore.   I bring my niece and nephew here for some fun and oh boy... it is simultaneously awesome, noisy, fun and expensive. The trick though is to buy their food+chips combo. You get a little steak of $29 which includes $20 card (can't remember the price). It's really worth it if you plan to eat and play. You save money, seriously.   My rating here is from \"guardian's point of view.\" The kids LOOOVE it here. They say it's better that ChucknCheese. I bet the sight and sound stimulates them. It's like Casino for adults though.   I'm a fan of fun games but I'm not a fan of non skilled games. I think this breeds gamblers...maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but I don't people really go here for that. The atmosphere was fun. There are a ton of games to play. The selection is huge. Would be a great place for a teenager or adult's birthday."}
{"text":"I have left very few reviews since opening my Yelp account. It takes a really \"standout\" experience for me to want to post something here.   This is such a moment.   We drove almost an hour and a half, to gather here for a friend's birthday. We planned on getting appetizers, playing a bunch of games, eating dinner, and then playing more games until the end of the night.   We were seated at the bar area right away, and our waitress came. She took our drink orders, and then left. I ordered a basic Whiskey Old Fashioned, the rest of our group ordered specialty drinks, that looked really good. My drink literally tasted like water. The only thing that lead me to believe there was anything else in it was the muddled fruits at the bottom of the tiny glass.   It was happy hour, I am sure they were swarmed at the bar, so this gets a small pass, and I mean small, its still a bar.   After this, the waitress returned, and we placed an appetizer order. We realized it was 6:20pm and the rest if our group would arrive at 7pm, so we planned on getting out appetizer check right after they came.   7pm came, the rest of our group came, and we were moved to a larger table, as we figured we would just do dinner first. But our appetizers had not come.   The waitress returned to get more drink orders, and we gave those.   7:30pm came around, and we still had no appetizers.   We flagged down what looked like a manager, and informed him of our wait, to which he scoffed and told us it was busy, but he would try to get our waitress.   Another 15 minutes passes without either of them coming by, and our party decided we would go to the food court instead. We waited for the manager or waitress to return so we could inform them we had no intention of staying and that we could cancel our appetizer order.   Another 15 minutes passed, and the manager and waitress both returned. After telling them we were going to leave and that they could cancel the appetizer order, they said that they were 'on their way out' and that they would give us a couple play cards to compensate us for the poor experience.   Another 15 minutes passed, with no return of either people, or our appetizers, and we walked out. We passed the manager as we left and he just looked at us as we passed him. He did not say a single word.   I am completely appalled at the service we received this evening. It turned our entire planned evening upside down. Not only this, but for an establishment that charges an outrageous amount of money for food and drinks, you would think that they would have a better trained staff, or a manager that had a clue what he was doing and how to help his customers. Even if he is not directly responsible for the food or the servers, he could have made some effort to make our situation right, instead of essentially laughing in our faces when we asked, and then not saying a word when we left.   We do not live anywhere near this location, but we will make sure to avoid this, as well as the other locations in Wisconsin. We, including our family and friends, will not give this company any more money."}
{"text":"Super busy Saturday night with a fight going on and numerous parties so our food ended delayed but management came our quickly to let us know what happened and made sure we got great food and took care of the bill without us even asking. I'm a retail store manager so I know what it's like to be completely overwhelmed on a weekend with business and understand that mistakes happen and actually would have never asked for a comp because I could see how hard everyone was working to take care of guests. Appreciate the gesture and how hard everyone was working."}
{"text":"I want to be the mayor of my own little electric wonderland!   As mayor I promise to offer a fully stocked bar of spirits and fountains of cold beer to allow my constituency to quench their thirst while drunkenly lobbing skee balls down the lanes, spilling beers on the air hockey table, and riding bitch on virtual motorcycles. To remind them of their stay in my land of delight, I'll let them redeem tickets for cheap-o trinkets with the name of my wonderland plastered all over 'em. I'd be the kind of mayor that brings back the nip of scotch with my loyal sycophants on a lazy afternoon and I'd give teenage hooligans the boot, telling them to go frolick in Tilly's or Charlotte Russe because my electric wonderland is a den of iniquity and requires a chaperone over 25 for anyone under the age of 18.   Too keep the masses happy I'd offer a massive feast at reasonable prices, with appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, seafood, pasta, chicken, steaks and sweet, sweet desserts. And to make them feel like they're getting their money's worth, maybe I'll create little indulgences like happy hours and meal deals. Between 4:30 and 7:00 Monday through Friday I'll let my lovely little bunnies indulge in cheap drinks and offer a Power Hour game card for ten bucks that allows all the game play their little hearts desire for a whole hour! And maybe I'll even offer a reverse happy hour from 10:00 to close Sunday through Thursday... Yeah, that's a great idea, and I'll make my closing hours midnight Sunday through Thursday and one in the morning on Friday and Saturday! Now, meal deals, meal deals, how about an Eat and Play combo? It would consist of 25 meals and a ten dollar game card for $15.99, and I'd give them the option of adding an extra ten bucks to their game card for an even 25 bucks. Now I'd be a generous mayor, but I still have to pay for the infrastructure somehow, so I'd have to put a time limit on this awesome deal. Let's say Sunday through Thursday from open to close and until 5 in the evening on Friday and Saturday.  And I'll sneak in a $2.00 activation fee for all new cards (except those with my mega meal deal), but to sweeten the blow I'll let my followers retain their cards to recharge them in the future, fee free! And I'll let 'em accumulate their ticket count over time to keep them coming back for more, more, MORE!  As mayor I will create a land where divorced dads with their kiddos, young couples looking for some goofy fun and video game nerds can coexist, with a happy beer buzz and over stimulated pupils the size of dinner plates due to my flashing lights, whirling colors and jaunty winning noises. It'll be like a casino, but it won't be a place where dreams go to die. Saturdays will be the most crowded, but will still be manageable in size, as the mob ebbs and flows between midway and video games. There will be skee ball, air hockey, basketball free throw games, streaming water races, those games where the horse runs fast when you roll little balls into holes, virtual bowling, wacky drop the coin games, old skool Pac Man, Donkey Kong and Space Invaders, House of the Dead, motorcycle and racecar games, virtual boxing and my personal favorite, Super Trivia, where six people match wits against one another and get hundreds of tickets if they're super suave like me! Then they can trade those tickets in for junk like nose hair trimmers in the shape of a finger, t-shirts with our emblem on it, Chinese finger traps and jumbo pixie sticks!  Ooo, ooo, and there will be fun little shots in those bottom heavy hourglass-shaped shot glasses where the mixer goes in the bottom and the shot goes in the top. And I'll even let 'em keep the shot glass, class act that I am. I can see it now, my own personal funland...  What? Dave and Buster's already snaked my idea? Those sneaky fucking bastards. I guess I'll just have to go there if I'm feeling the need for a little goofy fun.  Edit: By no means order anything that can't be produced by the divest of dive bars' short order cook. The food blows harder than a hooker trying to make rent on the 30th of the month. The games turn me into a giddy little girl, but the food turns me into a surly wench. Don't do it."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar tables with my newborn baby while  my daughter play video games to eat. My waitress wasn't that busy but was spending much more time at the tables she thought she was going to get a bigger tip from. When my wife arrived she took 15 minutes before she even came over to offer her a drink. I tried to give her a chance to straighten out and I asked her if there was something we did to piss her off. Letting her know she wasn't doing a very good job needed to correct it. She did not then proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the time we were there. The manager eventually come fare tab and apologized but I can still hear her talking trash about us to her coworkers for telling the manager. Let's just say I won't be back there again."}
{"text":"Overall, this was probably my first and last visit to this locations. The location itself is small in comparison to other D&B locations, which makes it feel like you are playing games on top of other people. There just isn't a lot of room there whatsoever.   On to the food and the restaurant portion...I was excited to have some good bar food, as their pictures blasting all over the venue made it look delectable. It couldn't have been further from the truth. First, from sit down to initial greeting took over 20 minutes, to which our server explained she didn't know someone sat her table. After we made our drink orders, the kids we were with wanted to wash their hands, but there's no bathroom access from the restaurant. You have to leave the restaurant and go to the back of the game room...very inconvenient. Our food took over 45 minutes to get to our table, with no explaination why, and it was terrible. I ordered the pepperoni pretzel pizza, and it was both freezer burnt and uncooked in the middle. The pretzel was just gummy and inedible. My husband's cheese sticks tasted the same way, just like the freezer. Our server didn't come back to check on our food or refill our drinks, and we needed to find her to get our check. When we did find her, she seemed quite bothered that we needed her. It was just such a disappointing experience, and with other game/activity bars in the charlotte area, I'd rather take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I planned my daughter's  7th birthday here.  I set up the party plans with a coordinator at their HQ in Dallas.  Originally planned for 14 people and then changed the number down to 10.    After the bill arrived I spoke with the GM about the over charges (for 14 ppl) and he was such a prick about it. He wouldn't even look at the emails that I had between myself and the party coordinator stating that I was paying for 10 people. There was a lack of communiation between the Dallas people and the Dave & Busters at Desert Ridge.  No one ever confirmed the # before we got going.  This could have been avoided.  I would have had the chance to leave and take my business elsewhere.    The GM completely ruined the day by being such a jerk about it.    I got a call from the assistant GM last night (after he read my poor survey review online)  and he tried to make it right by offering me credit towards their establishment.  Uhhh...I don't think so.  I will never be back.  I have never gotten such bad service from a restaurant manager before.   We were overcharged and I just want the overcharge fees back.  I will happily pay for the rest.   Do not plan your child's birthday party here.  The only reason I came here is because It is the only bowling alley up towards North Scottsdale/Cave Creek, where we live.  It is a huge rip off and I will never be back. Be warned."}
{"text":"Great place!! Fun for adults and kids. I would give it 5 star except today two bartenders decided to flirt and ignore customers for a while today and that was a little annoying. A third bartender was awesome however."}
{"text":"We dined here and then headed to the arcade.  Food was pretty standard. Typical stuff like nachos, burgers, cheese steaks, etc. I have to commend the manager for his customer service. One member in our group had issues with their order and the manager was very patient,  friendly, and understanding. Even after the dish was sent back 2-3 times, he wouldn't rest until all was well. And all done with a smile. Wish I remembered his name.  The arcade is, well, an arcade. It doesn't have the same magic as when you were a kid but it's still nice to re-visit those memories. The games aren't exactly cheap though. You play a few and then wonder where your credits went. But I don't think most people come here that often so it's not a huge issue in my opinion.  They have a few pool tables if you feel like you're too cool for arcade games. Can't remember the rates but they weren't too bad.  We went in the afternoon and it was pretty tame. Decent amount of people but not crowded.  I wouldn't exactly rush to come back but I'd look forward to an occasional birthday or event that was hosted here. It's a once in a while kind of thing."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to this location it's been a bunch of years and I was unimpressed. The waitress, Autumn, was rude. If you are going to work in the customer service industry learn to smile. She was judgmental and disinterested. The food was sub par, I got the Bistro Steak and Shrimp with lobster Alfredo, I ordered my steak medium rare it was rare. My boyfriend got the caveman combo, the ribs were over cooked and the sliders were well done. General consensus they can't cook red meat. The only food praises I can give was for the bang bang chicken it was good. The strawberry daiquiri was good the alcoholic root beer float was good. The bartender killed it. We had problems with the ticket cards from the beginning, one of our four cards wasn't even loaded. With my 190 tickets I got a plastic cup stating \"BOOM! WINNER!\" Overall it was a loud atmosphere with sup par food and no real customer service. Also the bathrooms were DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"On service alone, this place is a 5. Sidney was really personable. As first time customers, she went over the concept of dave and busters with us as well as their philanthropic endeavors. Additionally she talked about the games, menus and specials with us.    The food was slightly above average, nothing really remarkable, though the lobster Alfredo was really delicious.  We ordered a berry cherry mojito which came with no cherry or mint.  While it was delicious and refreshing, I would hardly call it a mojito.  The games are fun and the atmosphere is entertaining, also a good place to come to watch the games as they have dozens of big screen TVs.  All in all, I am glad I checked this place out, pretty much what I expected."}
{"text":"Super huge!!!  This place is very big and have so many games   I don't think I ever been to a d&b as clean as this one! Came here pretty late too and it was so clean!  Even for it being so big!   They have so many games here and it's so much fun!! Great workers here and everyone here's very helpful and happy!   Restrooms very clean too!!  Food is the same as every other chain place' but it works well with kids that's been running around all day playing games and stuff"}
{"text":"Great place, but clueless as a sports bar. Not showing FREE UFC on Fox in Vegas! They have Going Wild with Jeff Corwin, but no UFC!!"}
{"text":"I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets."}
{"text":"Dave and busters is always fun and I'm giving it a 3 because of inconsistency.  The drinks. I love their specialty TNT which is their version of a Long Island ice tea. When made right its perfect however once I went and there was a new girl that made it and has no one to help her and it tasted awful she was looking at the menu for direction.   The games are fun. Me and my boyfriend go and have a good time. If you have any issue with the machines they will fix it for u or credit back the points.   The food is hit and miss. The chicken quesadillas are always good. I order them every time they have nice juicy pieces of chicken and cheese yum! They need bigger ramekins for the sauces. The last time I went my bf had the backed chicken Alfredo and a Caesar. It was ok. He's not fussy so he didn't complain but the salad had some brown leaves which he left on his plate and his pasta was ok nothing memorable. The sauce was a bit off. I had the quesadillas and the new shrimp and lobster Alfredo with steak on top. My steak was dry, sauce tastes weird not really an Alfredo sauce but I ate it.   Customer service was really good! I had this girl that looks Latina she was knowledgeable about the menu and always made sure we were ok. Super attentive   Prizes are crap. We had 4000 tickets and didn't want anything in there. All the teddy bears were ugly and there was nothing worth getting so we kept our tickets  I'd give this place a 4 if it were more consistent"}
{"text":"Ok let me just say this when at Dave and Busters always and I mean always keep your eyes on your game card. who knew ppl steal game cards. The perk if you have your purchase receipt you can a replacement card and the person who stole it cant use the card any more. The perks if you reload a card then you get free game plays there's at least 5 games in which you can play with out it taking any money from your card. that's beneficial if you have a lot of kids with you. down side the parking lot is ridiculous I mean the new location was needed so that you wouldn't have to drive all the way to Concord but I knew putting it so close to Carolina place mall would be a problem. I mean its really crazy the parking here. Other than that Ive eaten at the Concord location before but not this one so I cant rate the food. overall I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Horrible food ,horrible service, no stars . We brought a group of 30 you sure would think you could get some attention. Not here!!"}
{"text":"The games and arcade here are decent. But the one thing I've noticed the handful of times I've been here, the service is so slow and disrespectful, and the selection of games is mediocre, including most of them being out of service or not working. How does a business that relies on entertainment and gaming as a means of profit, have them not working for customers. That's like going to a fish store that doesn't sell fish. Terrible. My friend ordered food, and I swear I could've heated up a hot dog, fries and nachos in my Kitchen faster than they did in the kitchen. Probably took it 25 mins. It wasn't even busy either. On to the next! The food was decent though when it finally arrived, 30 mins later."}
{"text":"Met up with a bunch of folks over here last night. Located in the new Tempe Marketplace it is a busy hang out.  I don't know about the food (didn't eat), but playing skeeball drunk just works... And amazingly the prizes you earn with your tickets are decent (compared to pizza joints that rip off little kids for junk). I got myself a nice shiny Dave and Busters shot glass.  Unfortunately the upstairs was not yet open... I will return for air hockey when it does."}
{"text":"Come here every now and then for fun arcade time!  Nice place, good clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food tastes good! But I waited a long time to get the food . That's the only drawback"}
{"text":"The service was not terrible but there were a lot of dirty tables left not cleaned for the next people who wanted to sit at the self seating areas. After that disappointment I went to the other side and was seated at a spacious table. The server was nice and sweet, but when we got the food it honestly wasn't that good. The grilled wings were delicious but the sweet and sour sauce tasted generic. The food can be brought out fresher and the reason I knew it was sitting out was because the cheese was very dry. But overall we have a great experience in the arcade area"}
{"text":"The WORST dining experience I have had in years. We arrived at 9:15 PM after all the crowds had cleared. We did not receive our food until 11:15PM not to mention that more than one person's order was incorrect. Danielle, our waitress, was completely unapologetic and incompetent. I am not one to complain at restaurants, but this honestly deserved for me to take time to write a review. After waiting for 2 hours (just for the food), we asked for our checks which then proceeded to take another 30 minutes to arrive. Forget about it when it came to drinks as those took more than 35 minutes each to arrive. I asked for a manager, his name was Maxwell and he came up to our table and stared blankly. This man was completely unprofessional and did not have a clue how to handle this situation. After leaving a complaint, we went to sign our checks and Danielle, our waitress ripped off the feedback portion of our entire party's checks! I asked for a new receipt from the manager who said he would use this as a \"coaching\" moment. Our tab was 80.00 dollars and I am disgusted that we spent money there. Will NEVER go back. The games were fun but our horrible dining experience left a horrible taste in my mouth. Look elsewhere to eat!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place zero stars because the bar in the game room!!! I literally waited 18mins for service and there was only 3 people at the bar! Terrible!"}
{"text":"We always have lots of fun here! It's runs us about $50-60 each for a couple hours of play. Lots of fun games you actually want to play and they are always adding. Drinks are good. If there's ever problems with the games the staff is helpful and quick to fix it. I had my birthday party here on a Saturday around 1pm without having a reservation and it worked out perfectly.  We were able to push together several tables and order a number of food items. Our server was prompt with our drinks and sending out our food for our party.  This place is fun with and without kids and you can always have a blast."}
{"text":"I like this Dave and Busters....bartenders are friendly, drinks are good and food is good. Didnt ever think I would visit a place this, that I have back in Cali, but I enjoyed myself here when I visited. I will be back again, to enjoy more Happy hour drinks"}
{"text":"We were able to secure a large section for my girlfriend's brothers birthday. The staff went above and beyond and were quick in taking our orders. The food came out quickly and the games are fun. They have a game(s) for everyone!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but we had a great time. The food and service was good, too. The chocolate cake was awesome. The games are diverse and entertaining. They have something for all ages."}
{"text":"Horrible service,  won't let you play but sells you a beer to stand around and do nothing while all Ganges are of before closing......"}
{"text":"This is a review for their arcade games, not their food or drinks.  I have tried them at this location and the one in San Antonio and they are the typical Applebee's quality, which isn't a bad thing, but not the best if you know what I mean.  The games are reasonably priced and the wife and I always have fun when we come here.  One thing that I like about this location is that most of the games are working here.  For some reason the ones in Texas always have a lot of games not working, which is a drag sometimes.  In addition, it is in a great mall and has a lot of things to do when you are done."}
{"text":"Met my friend here for dinner. I was thinking about a cheeseburger but decided on The Ultimate Mac & Cheese. Mac & cheese with chicken and bacon should be good, right? It was pretty good. Not amazing, but I liked it. Service was good. I was too tired to stick around and play games in the arcade, but the arcade looks very modern and I'd like to go back soon to play and maybe order a drink or two."}
{"text":"Bittersweet, oh so bittersweet. Tonight was great because of the people I was with, my sister-in-law and my best friend. Arcade games are ALWAYS FUN. The  food was 7 out of 10, it wasn't bad but for \"arcade/snack bar food\" it's was pretty alright, still pricey though for the quality they are. I'd say their dishes range from $15-$20. I honestly don't have very many complaints aside from the sucky non-existent service. It took forever for them to take bills and when we went to the bar for glasses of water. No, not the process but it took so long for them to even greet us. After we ate, we each got a to-go box for our meals. We didn't want to lug them around so we asked our waiter to hold them for us, he said certainly and we even wrote our names on our boxes, but when we went to retrieve them, they were no where to be found. \"The cleaning crew probably picked them up\" wait, even with our names on them? Even though you're a restaurant, and you should be familiar with your own carry out boxes? When we went looking for the front desk to swap cards and retrieve our leftovers, we spoke aloud, but were left confused even with security there, he didn't even try to direct is elsewhere or to let anyone know we were at the counter.  Also, this was a very slow, watching grass grow Monday night. Minimal people were there tonight, I couldn't imagine what the service is like on busy weekend nights.  If it weren't for Steve, who tried to offer to fix things next time, I'd probably not give this place a second look."}
{"text":"Recently opened in Downtown Summerlin and already making a splash with locals looking to escape the summer heat, I was a bit of a surprised that Dave & Buster's had not already made its mark on Las Vegas considering the fact that I'd previously visited locations in Detroit and Columbus as far back as the mid-90's, dining never really the \"focal point\" but the arcade a lot of fun and the televisions plentiful for watching college football games.  Originally founded in the early 1980s, and now nearing their 90th store Nationwide, Dave & Buster's at Downtown Summerlin inhabits the space directly across from Regal Cinemas and featuring a vast floorplan of Food, Games and Sports it was just prior to 6pm that our party checked-in at the podium, reservations well-advised during primetime hours, though any wait-time could easily be spent on the video games.  Seated at a sturdy four-top to the right of the bar, a ton of Televisions positioning Dave & Buster's nicely as *the* place to watch Football, Big Events or UFC in the nearly two-year old shopping center, it was with surprisingly efficient service for a place so new that the evening got started, plenty of managers circulating with the use of headsets allowing the team to fill coverage gaps as small groups continued to file in just as two sizable birthday parties sequentially got situated.  Energetic but not exactly \"loud\" considering the concept, a bulk of the noise merely that of pop-music and conversation as the gaming area sits a fair distance from the food and drink, positive attitudes and smiles seem to be part of the culture at Dave & Buster's and although the several-page menu may at first seem daunting, the size is mostly a result of pictures with server's recommendations helping to narrow the options into a list that is both well-culled and fair priced.  Obviously not to be confused as fine dining, but at least on par with the rest of the outdoor mall in terms of quality and mass-appeal, the order at Dave & Buster's was intended to take a broad look at some of their classics as well as the new Summertime selections, a trio of adult-beverages to start certainly not the Spirit-forward work of a Strip \"Mixologist,\" but at the same time still quite tasty with both the Snow Cone and Tiki drink both the sort of thing that could get lightweights into trouble as the alcohol is well hidden by all the fruit and sweeter stuff.  Continuing to order in threes, a Children's menu affording the ability to taste D&B's famous \"Golden Planks\" in a smaller portion with results par-for-the-course Chicken Strips served with addictive Chipotle Honey Sauce, more interesting bites were found in Grilled Cheese Sticks that saw Manchego put to good use alongside more typical Cheddar and Mozzarella in a golden, crunchy package featuring a gooey center, the Steak n' Cheese Tater Cakes even more impressive as the Hashbrown base was virtually oilless beneath nicely seasoned Beef, Onions and more melted Cheese.  Told that the Burgers were a \"must,\" but also intrigued by Sandwiches as well as some of the Seafood and Chicken choices, suffice it to say that the Maker's Mark BBQ Burger outperforms anything tasted at nearby Shake Shack or Ribs n' Burgers in terms of taste or quality, the 8oz patty grilled perfect medium beneath House-pulled Pork and caramelized Onions, while a delicious half-pound of line-caught Cod fried golden showed an unexpected dedication to sustainable souring, the Short Rib & Cheesy Mac Stack unfortunately falling short of the rest as a result of significant underseasoning.  Not holding back when it comes to desserts, though those dining with small children should be weary that a three-course meal in the middle of a room of flashing lights and temptation will test the patience of even the best behaved boy or girl, there is no doubt a reason that Dave & Buster's Brookie Sundae Tower is featured at the top of the list as three of America's favorite sweets are brought together in a stack of pure decadence, the tender Donut Holes a much lighter way to finish the meal on a sweet note while the Bananas Foster Pie offers a more adult option in a portion better suited for singles.  Taking about an hour to play games after dinner, the range of options each charged a somewhat arbitrary range of \"points\" per play, both adults and children will be challenged by everything from Skee-Ball and Air Hockey to shoot 'em up style games as well as those for which they can win tickets, all-in-all a great way to shake down the food and let the little ones expend some energy at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here but had a blast playing arcade games, haven't had this much fun in a long time playing games. They have the most selection of games that I've seen since I was a child!"}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful time. I'll admit the restrooms look prehistoric but they were clean. Little over priced but the games made up for all that. The new VR games was really cool. My server Megan was top notched"}
{"text":"Wed is half off games (including pool) and combine that with happy hour and it's a pretty fun time.... the food is reg sports bar food and can be a little salty at times but hey drinks and games? That's pretty fun to me. I just wish the chain had fighting games like street fighter etc."}
{"text":"I don't know about many others but I personally love this place. Especially now that they have the power card menu options. I love it because my family has a great time here. We fight over the last credits on the power cards, leave with great souvenirs and full bellys. I was so sick of the usual Peter Piper Pizza scene for food and games with the fam. And this place has opened up a new door for me and my fam wit their updated menu. Wednesday's are our favorite cuz it's 1/2 priced games all night. And the food is so Delish! Huge variety and large portions to make sure you get your money's worth. As for me and my family, we love this place."}
{"text":"More like zero stars. We just went into Dave and Busters to watch the College National Championship game. It was pretty empty in the bar so we decided to wait for a big booth that was being cleared rather than take an smaller empty table. We asked the busboy if we could have the booth when he was done clearing it, he gave us some weird answer about how nobody was sitting there...well obviously...that's why we asked for it. He finished clearing it but didn't wipe it off. He went and said something to the bartender and they both gave us a weird look. It became obvious that they were annoyed that we didn't just sit at an empty table. The bartender then walked over to us and asked us if we wanted to sit at another table while they got the booth ready? Really? You coulda just brought a rag with you and wiped off the table. We said we would stand and wait. Five minutes later we were still standing there...the busboy still hadn't returned and the bartender was just ignoring us while sorting menus at an empty bar. We walked out and went to California Pizza Kitchen - where they actually greeted and seated us."}
{"text":"The good, the bad & the ugly. We all know D&B, and all are not equally alike. I love my games, love my food- who doesn't;) The good: food and games. The bad: why does this location allow children in the bar area.  The ugly: tv's, sporting games and alcohol (well that's the positive) children hearing the profanities. Not me of course- I plead the fifth. Well, perhaps during certain sporting events being televised. Not my problem.  The side dining areas on each side of the bar, that's were the children should be.  Now, that being said let's chat about the games, shall we... Old school games & new games- yes!  Purchase that D&B card and hold onto it- that's money and tickets for redemption;) Reloading is a click, well perhaps two clicks and one is right back into inserting that and playing away!   Playing all the while is the deejay as well.  Air hockey, skeeball- old school?!   Space Invaders! Star Wars! Something for everyone- trust me:) Three stars, why you may ask...children under 16 years old, as well as infants and toddlers at 11pm in the bar area."}
{"text":"Great food , kids had a great time and the restaurant is away from the Game area, so you can enjoy your meal ,  I would just come for the ribs.  They also have a great allergy program that all managers and wait staff are very well trained with.  Amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time bowling here and had a great time. Came here with my boyfriend and cousin. It's $35 for one hour and you rent the shoes for $3. The atmosphere was great and the food was great. We also played some arcade games before since we had to wait. Our waiting time was about 15 minutes. I think if you want to go bowling for a bit and have some good food it's a great place to go. However if you go strictly for bowling $35 an hour doesn't sounds like the best deal out there."}
{"text":"Games, prizes, and good times are some of the words to describe my experience here. It bought me back to being a kid again.  I went with two friends of mine who invited me out and I'm so glad they did. I plan on going back here and recommend this place to others. The games are great and the atmosphere there is very inviting. Its 22.00 for a 127 chips and go there on a Tuesday night since it is half off. I haven't had the food yet but I'm sure it's great too."}
{"text":"Dave and Buster's (D&B) gets three stars for food plus one star for the atmosphere, games and entertainment that they offer for a grand total of four stars.  I've been to D&Bs approximately four times since they opened.  The first time I visited, I was literally amazed at the size of their game room and the variety of games that they offer.  You can play pool, shuffleboard, air hockey, shoot hoops, eat, watch the game, drink, and play video games.  Also, they sell dinner-and-a-movie!  You can have your dinner and buy movie tickets for Crocker Park, which is at the next exit west on I-90.  What's more, they cater private parties ranging from $16 - $25 per person.    The second and third times I visited were private, catered parties through work - very nice because they were free, the food was delicious and served buffet-style, and we got to play video games for free.  Last night, my wife and I joined some of her co-workers at D&B for dinner and some games.  With drinks and games, our bill came to $100, which is actually kind of pricey.  I was thinking, damn, I could've gone to Don's Pomeroy House and had a much better meal!  My wife ordered BBQ Ribs with Mashed Potatoes.  I tried her ribs and they were delicious.  We're not talking Famous Dave's delicious, but they were good.  I ordered the salmon, which was served with vegetables and rice.  The salmon was very thick and excellently prepared.  The vegetables were a little tough and dry, they should have been steamed longer.  The rice also should have been cooked a little longer because it was on the hard side.  But the flavors were really good.  The mixed drinks were also very good, but the quantities were small.  The only negative aspect of D&B is they don't offer dinner & game combos after 5:00 PM on Friday and Saturday.  Those combos are a great value, starting at $15.99, they include a full meal plus $10 in game points (48 points).  If you join their Gold Rewards program, all the games cost slightly less.  Other than that, the video game selection here is the best I've seen anywhere.  They have a lot of 'shoot-em-up' games, which my wife really likes.    And you gotta love their in-house credit card system.  You don't have to drop coins in every video game machine, you simply prepay and you receive a D&B video game card to keep, which works in most of the games.  Some games require D&B coins to play, however.  Other games give you tickets, which you can redeem for prizes up to and including an X-Box 360, Wii, etc.  But those require a ton of tickets.  On a side note, one of our friends was adept at getting this one game to give him between 300 - 500 tickets each time he played.  It's the game with the light that goes round in circles and you have to stop it between two markers to win.  Well, he played that game many times and walked out with a few thousand tickets in just under an hour.  He earned an X-Box 360 from D&B a while back!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My family went to dine and play for my little brother's 12th birthday. I ordered the boss chicken club sandwich which was neither tasty nor worth the price. Then the next morning I awoke with the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had. Been laid up in bed for going on 3 days now. Horrible experience. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Stick to just games and drinks!  Bad service for mediocre food. Wait is horrible for seating, and host staff is inconsistent with their information. While we were waiting for our table I overheard one host inform a group that the booths near the bar were open seating, but when we asked to confirm this we were told otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is huge I've been to Dave and Busters in Kansas City Kansas, this one in Las Vegas is huge and lots of games. Highly recommend for UFC fights."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's at Concord is A-OK. Food is slightly above the average Applebee's/Ruby Tuesday. I love the golden chicken tenders though... cheesy bacon fries are yum-yum too.  I'm probably not coming back though, because a game that there I like called \"Harley-Davidson & L.A. Riders\" is no longer at this D&B. Sorry to say. :\ This game is old though and the last time I played the game here was on its last legs. Handlebars were so unresponsive on player 1. Not surprising for a heavy 16-year-old chunk of machinery. 'Daytona USA' still lives on here, and there's a new Mario Kart game and a 'Transformers' simulator game which is fairly interesting.   While it's good for adults and little kids, gamers might become disappointed with Dave & Buster's here in Concord. I can still recommend it, but for me personally, Dave & Buster's sucks without 'Harley-Davidson & L.A. Riders'. :\"}
{"text":"A great venue to bring the kids, have some fun playing games, and even enjoying a couple drinks. We love it.  Prices are fair, games are good...the atmosphere is loud, so never a problem bringing very young kids.  Located at Tempe Marketplace, its a great bargaining chip when trying to shop with your kids."}
{"text":"Be very careful planning events with this place.  They are a major fail at the options they offer - such as not including normal beverages, soft drinks, tea, etc with buffets - and really offer no incentives of any kind with their 'packages' other than a cheap $10 gaming card.  Also started applying pressure to 'book it or lose it' within 3 hours of talking to them, claiming they have other parties interested."}
{"text":"This place would be so much better if children were not allowed after a certain time. Its ok to have a place dedicated to adults."}
{"text":"So I am currently at D&B's and since I've been sitting here for about 20 minutes and have not yet even received a drink I decided to write a review. Service is TERRIBLE. Oh and we had to wipe out own table down prior to sitting... The staff seems like they don't even want to be here. I get it, you are at work on a Saturday but why not make the best of it and give the customer a good experience. We are celebrating my MIL's birthday and it's kind of put a damper on the night.   My husband had to ask for a server and also grab our own menus. Hopefully the food is worth the wait but I won't hold my breathe.. Might be another hour before we receive. :/  Well got our food.. Took forever. Decent but lukewarm.  We talked with the manager and he and the server apologized."}
{"text":"Nope nope and nope. I was forced by door greeter after being chased down to remove my sunglasses. To my horror I did, we sat at bar no greeting, left after 10 minutes. We walk around to new place to see the  cooks stand by salon nextdoor and smoke, cat call and act inappropriately. If I ever saw the nasty, unsanitary habits of management and cooks I wouldn't step foot in this establishment. Gross comes from gross!"}
{"text":"So you have to pay for a card to spend money at D&B?  Bad business model and I was not made aware of this on previous visits. My bad, but it took bringing just my daughter to find this out...ya'll just let me pay without explaining when I had larger groups."}
{"text":"It was way too loud in there for me. Horrible acoustics. I regularly go to the one in Honolulu and dont mind the noise at all. Typical Las Vegas, more like a night club with the noise rather than a family fun place. The restaurant was ok. Food was ok, but i immediately knew it wasnt something i would really go to again unless something is changed."}
{"text":"The only reason to even go in is the games if you want food lol seriously just go somewhere else.  they mess things up so bad then come back at you and roll there eyes at questions like umm i put in an app about an hour ago do u think that will be comming out soon . As our food was being sat down. Met with an eye roll and what did you have?I know its impossable to remember everything but it wasent our fault u didnt put it in....just dont."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Dave & Busters since we don't have them in the Reno area.  I went with my son, his friend and a friend of mine during a trip out of town to the Tempe area.  The place is huge and pretty exciting when you first enter with a bar in front, games in the rear and dining area on both sides of the bar.  It appears that the right side of the dining area (which is closed off to games) is more for folks who want to just eat and sit away from the gaming action.  The rest of the tables are either bar-side or right next to all of the games.    The hostess took a good amount of time being nice and explaining the \"pay and play\" specials and other options we had.  I ended up buying a $12.00 playing card (which I think loaded up 48 \"chips\") and ordering off the menu.  They have a pretty varied menu although it really is just more creative \"sports bar\" food with a tad higher price.  I ended up splitting a burger with my friend - don't remember the name but it was a beef patty with buffalo chicken strips on it and onion straws on top.  (Yeah - you read that right).  My son got a mushroom burger and asked for no onions.  He and I also split the spinach dip.   Feelings on food changed  during the course of our visit.  My friends soup came out cold twice and once she finally got a hot one she didn't care for it - too salty.  My son loved his burger (even though he had to pick the onions off since they didn't see the \"no onion\" request).  The spinach dip was very good.  The burger my friend and I split was tasty although dry so we got a side of Frank's sauce.  My friend later got sick but I was fine so maybe it was her soup?  Our waiter was very busy and seemed very new - he was also very nice so I personally didn't much mind the small mistakes because he felt so bad about it.  They have a HUGE variety of games.  I just glanced around but saw everything under the sun.  They evven have a horror game that monitors your heart rate!!! (Say WHAT!?)  The ticket redemption center is not like most arcades with a bar of toys an angry teenager behind it.  This was huge and more like a store of goodies than anything else.  You can walk around and touch/feel and pay with the prizes before you commit to spending your tickets.  When all was said and done I had spent $42.00.  That total included 2 drinks, 2 entrees (1 split), 1 appetizer and 54 game chips.  I didn't think that was bad at all and I would go again for sure!   Final thoughts:  1 - I don't love the limited options to re-load the card.  My son only needed 6 more chips to play the game he wanted to at the end of the day and since the re-load machine doesnt offer 6 chips I had to use my debit card twice to get 3 more chips twice.  That was annoying.  2 - The have a huge beer........it's cool.........it's like a big mini keg and holds about 8 beers. I think it costs around $30.00.  I want it.  3 - I seriously wanna get a group of adults to this place and drink and play games.  That is all."}
{"text":"Sure, it's not \"cool\" fun, but it is fun! 2 4-year-olds, 1 7-year-old, and 4 30-somethings spent the evening at D&B's last night, and we had a great time. We refuse to take our kids to likes of Chuck-E-Cheese. This place allows us to all find something we can enjoy. The food is better (note: I didn't say \"good\", just comparatively better); the games are better; the alcohol is... existent.  When the mommies slipped away for a little private time, we were impressed with the new sports bar area. The TVs are HUGE. The chairs are swank. The taps are flowing. The staff is friendly.  Also, the prizes have gotten much better. Our kids walked out with actual quality stuffed animals. Everyone was pleased."}
{"text":"Slow service at the bar, taking 10 minutes for a beer.  Not the bartenders fault they are horrendously understaffed.  Also, food shows ip cold and after a lengthy wait."}
{"text":"Very diassappinted. I have been to 6 different Dave and busters over the last 15 years. I always loved it! I have been to the Westlake D&d's twice in the last month. Both times, the service and food in the restaurant were awefull! I ordered a drink at the bar in the arcade but couldn't get the same drink at the restaurant. The server seemed totally lost both times. They weren't rude but I'd guess that it was there first day both times. The food was way over cooked and not eatible both times. The server never asked either time why we only took one bite of our meals. In the arcade, we encountered a couple of games that didn't work and had trouble with our game card. It wasn't a big deal but when you spend $150.00 in two hours you hope to enjoy it. I didn't! I won't be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with my cousin and the experience wasn't all that great. First the receptionist gave me wrong info of the $10 free play , secondly one of the employees told me not to walk thru this bar side like I'm a child lol I'm a grown azz man .be aware of the restrooms attendants ... You'll feel obligated to tip. TBH my whole experience here I felt im getting hussled from the entrance to the exit.... This is nothing like the Hawaiis D&B's"}
{"text":"We were \"greeted\" by four of the least hospitable \"hostesses\" of all time. We probably would have walked right out if our kids weren't looking forward to this visit.  The service was slow, but friendly, and the food was cold. When my wife inquired about the location of the ladies' room, the same hostesses responded as if my wife should have been clairvoyant.  This was our first and last visit.  We've enjoyed the Desert Ridge and Tempe Marketplace locations, but we won't be back. We're looking forward to Main Event's grand opening."}
{"text":"Two stars for the arcade - the games are in working order. And they have a good selection, this Dave n busters is on the smaller side compared to ones found on the east coast. Additionally the food service here is so unbelievably poor, I'd eat elsewhere in downtown summerlin and just come here to play their games. We ate here once and it turned into a 3 hr meal, 1 hour waiting to order, another hour waiting for our food that we ordered, and 1 hour waiting for the check, we recently tried again and the results where the same except I got tired of waiting 45 mins for a glass of water I just told the girlfriend we are leaving and going some place else ... The servers here don't have a clue what they are doing and I am sure management is not any better as they clearly lack the ability to train their employees."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Dave & Buster's. Overall, I did have a good time but there were things here and there that didn't leave me super happy.  We got there at like 6:30PM on a Wednesday and the wait time for food was about 30 minutes. They said if we could find a seat at the bar, we could have the full menu there. Luckily, we were able to find one quick. They have a list of entrees you can choose from where you can get a card for credits to spend on games. It was a pretty good deal, so we did that.  Food/drinks: There are barely any vegetarian options which kind of stinks. But I'm a pescetarian so I had two options to choose from....  *Fire grilled salmon: not bad, the salmon was pretty chard so some parts did taste like burnt pieces, but it went well with the rice. The green beans were nicely cooked. *Dynamite fried shrimp: the calorie count for this dish was ridiculous, like 1400 calories. The whole thing was fried (the green beans too). The only thing I liked from this dish was the mashed potatoes and the sauce that came with it. *Frose: this was great, a little sweet and comes with those mini bottles of rose.  *Black Raspberry Proseccorita: this was pretty sour and came with a mini bottle of prosecco.  The food and drink all had calorie counts next to them. The drinks didn't have prices next to them which was weird.   Service: Pretty slow. It was opening week so we were okay, but it was annoying that we mainly came to play and sat around for 2 hours. To make up for their slow service, they gave us more credits to play without us asking. That was nice :)   Games: there were a lot of people, but we were able to play the games we wanted eventually. They had a lot of phone games like flappy bird, fruit ninja, candy crush etc. Wednesday is half price games and some of them too a lot of credits... I can't imagine how much it is on a normal day. You can get prizes with your credits, they do have some cool things but we just saved our points for next time.   We'll be back but probably only during happy hour and when games are half off!"}
{"text":"Dave and Busters has finally made it to Las VEGAS but too bad the great service and management did not come along with it. Today I went to D&B to watch some football with my family and was very disappointed in the service that I was provided. We got there around 1:00 to sit down and accordingly with it being the first Sunday of football we had to wait about 30 mins to be seated. Once seated we were greeted by our waiter Danny and he took our order everything seemed as if it were going to go well. We ordered 2 orders of the unlimited wings and an order of Nachos I ordered the wings that were suppose to be BBQ and my fiancé friend ordered buffalo wings. We sat there for about 45 mins before anything came out food wise. Our waiter told us the Kitchen was backed up so the order was taking longer than usual. When the food that did come out came it was wrong and the server that brought it out got a little attitude when I told him that. They brought out 2 orders of Buffalo wings when I ordered the BBQ. At this time the Nachos still did not come out. 10 mins later my waiter came by asked me if my food was okay and I told him what happened. 20 more mins later my wings came out correctly but still no Nachos. Our waiter Danny walked passed about 3 times not addressing us so we finally stopped him and asked about the Nachos he said \"Let me go check\" and never came back. 20 more minutes passed and my fiancé Nachos still did not come but the person seated next to us that ordered after us received their Nachos. Once again we asked the waiter about our food and he said let me go check on it. 10 more mins passed and they finally came out which would be 1hour 30mins after we ordered them. By this time the rest of our group showed up. They sat there for about 15 mins before any waiter asked them what they would like. So we ordered with an entirely different waiter. At this time we also ordered a refill on our wings. My cousin who joined us ordered an order of regular wings and fries for herself and her daughter not the unlimited. Their orders came out about 20 mins later but we're cold like it had been sitting on a table not even under a heat lamp so they sent them back. They brought out another order of wings but it was an order of refill wings not their original order so at this time we asked to speak with a manager the Manager came in (a white dude with a red beard and bald head) and was slightly rude and told us that we had an attitude and that we should just eat the food and he would bring more out which I find very rude as a customer. Then after that the general manager Phil came out he told us that we allegedly threatened his staff and that we had to leave. I will NEVER eat at this D&B again they have poor service and their staff members are rude and unprofessional so many of them rolled their eyes and gave attitude when we asked them to correct their coworkers mistakes. I really hope that they turn things around because it sucks that one of my favourite places to go eat and drink was such a horrible experience. I will definitely being sending my issues up to the corporate office on Monday morning."}
{"text":"So Last night...my husband, my 3 children,  (10, 6 & 5) myself, my best friend (who is deaf. This is relevant. Promise) & her husband came here after a few hours at the outlets & decided to treat ourselves & our children as this only happens quite literally...once a year. I, myself, am a waitress, so I like to to think I'm pretty understanding. We waited almost 15 minutes to just to ORDER our drinks. I order an Irish LIT. It has sour mix & ginger ale. I asked her to see if they could just do a splash of sour mix & the rest ginger ale as I get SEVERE stomach/heart burn issues with the sour. She says \"Sure! I'll see what I can do!\"  We got them ordered. Another 10 minutes to get just the waters & kids drinks. We hadn't received our bar drinks yet either. We order our food. That's fine. We are there for about an hour. Eat, drank our first round of drinks & took the kids to play some games. While playing, Sierra, our server approaches us an proceeds to ask us to pay our checks because \"her managers are asking for her cash out\". I have 14 years in this industry. I know that's bull. We go back to pay & the entire serving staff is standing around our table. My friend goes to the bar to get a drink only to be approached by who I can assume is the manager. He assigns us a new server. Ok. Cool . Suddenly...my chest is on FIRE! I know this feeling all too well. Sour mix. The entire time everyone else was playing I'm at our table in fetal position. I'm finally okay. Ask for a drink for my friend and I & am told she's cut off. Hmmm...  Was told she was drunk when we got there because she was slurring her words. Yep...i bet she was. She's hard of hearing.   My bill was almost $150...I still tipped...we spoke to a manager & we never even got so much as an apology. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a Birthday party at this location . The staff was excellent and went the extra mile for me and my guest the whole time. Great place to have a celebration, no matter the age."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best service we've had I'll tell yah that. First off ,the girl at the bowling stand was so rude and never called our name that was on a \"list\". Secondly, we ate food here deciding we clearly weren't going to have time to bowl and it took them over 45 mins for a vanilla milkshake that the \"new managers\" were making. Everyone at this place was so dysfunctional it was quit sad. Before we ate we played some of the games and the bartender had dropped 2 glass cups, and was making drinks out of the same sink. Was looking forward to this place, but I would have to say there needs to be better management. Zero stars."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would.    Waited an hour + just for the table for our group.  Another hour + for our food.  By the time we got it, it was cold.   Like not even sort of warm, cold like it sat for about an hour.   Then we were told we wouldn't be charged for a salad that never came.  Waited another hour for our bills only to find the salad was still on there.  By this time we were 4 hours into this horrid place and just wanted to freaking leave.   We weren't about to wait MORE for her to fix it again.  It was the worst experience.   Will never ever ever be back."}
{"text":"Why does the service at Dave & Busters have to suck so bad.   The waiters see you, you flag for them to come over and they don't want to serve you.  Where is the management?  Who trains these useless people?  Why don't servers want to work even when there's no one around?  Please fire these idiots."}
{"text":"Dinner and Games:  Skip the dinner part!  Yuck - Dried out, over-cooked, obviously frozen burger patties are the base of \"Daves Classic Cheeseburger\" and the crinkle cut fries were barely cooked. The fish and chips were no better.  As my young son said, we could get better frozen burgers from the grocery store!  For as crappy as the food was you'd hope at least the service would be good but oh no, you'd be disappointed there too. It would have been quicker to go to a store, buy cheap burger patties, buy a grill to cook them on, assemble the grill and then char them to a crisp.   Our drinks order also arrived wrong as well; and I had to find the server to get the mistakes off the bill at the end of our meal.  Games: My kids thought they were fun enough but many of the games had broken ticket-returns which was very disappointing both while playing and even more so when the kids went to redeem them. No, I don't expect to \"win\" an GoPro camera but for the $30 they spent (I'm a miser, I admit it) I'd expect a flimsy plastic cup or key chain with the D&B logo. Nope, a bag of gummy candy was all available ! Woo-hoo!  Maybe as a sports bar this is a better place but as a family evening out it was a gigantic disappointment and certainly not-value for money.   (Visited on a Wednesday night in July)"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday evening with my brother they were not at all busy yet we sat there 20 minutes waiting for our server. Only reason we stayed was because my brother was crazy over this place. The food was decent until we got home. Both of us got severe food poisoning and we know it was from that because we hadn't really ate that day. The games were fun but the overall experience was mediocre."}
{"text":"This review is based on the games and food:  Games: we went on Wednesday where games cost half price. All the games were already discounted on the machine. It was relatively busy but there were a lot of options to pick from. I like it how this chain targeted different age groups (teens+). Some games were fun and some were ok. It was fun to try out but I do not think I will return.   Food: the food itself was subpar. I ordered thr bbq pulled pork burger with swest potato fries. The burger came with the meat and sauce but separately which was weird. Service was really good though, the waiter was actively busy and there were a lot of people eating."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Saturday night. The place was quite busy, with mostly an early 20's crowd. They checked our ID's at the entrance and the lady making announcements at the desk was more than happy to take our coats for a price of $2. The entrance is sprayed with vanilla scented air freshener, which reminds you of casinos. We asked the lady at the front about the particular scent and she told us it's vanilla. In general, you get a casino vibe from this place, except for (thank goodness) there's no smoking.  When you go in there are separate restaurant type of sitting areas. The arcade has a variety of games, including some of the more technologically advanced touchscreen ones. The prizes however, as you can guess, are quite mediocre. I ended up winning 450 points by the end of the night and only got prizes that I could have bought at a dollar store. Despite that, the dopamine rush you get from playing car games, shooting games and spin the wheel is undeniably great.   We ended up at the bar once we claimed our prizes. The food is your average tater tots, nachos and quesadillas. The service wasn't bad for a busy night.  I would definitely come here again with a big crowd for beers and a fun experience."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for an adult double date night and since I was under the impression this was a place for adults, I was less than impressed with the amount of children seated in the bar area. Also not impressed with the game selection. Some, even if you won, the game was over after one round. The food and our service was good but overall, I was not impressed and probably won't be back. Over priced and less than impressed."}
{"text":"Okay so basically if you just want to play games Dave and Busters is perfect. If you want anything to drink or eat you're screwed. I'll cut them slack because it was a Friday night however it took 20 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge me, I ordered a drink and watched her serve another dozen people before I even saw mine being made so I decided to go to the bar downstairs in their bowling alley. That took another 15 minutes.... to get TWO BEERS. It's really not hard. Not to mention it was 14 dollars for two beers. I highly recommend just bringing a flask if you go and want to drink. It's expensive and takes a total of 45 minutes to get a beer. Also the brunette bartender in the game room upstairs on Friday night around 10:30 was probably the rudest lady I've ever met. I will not return, even for the games. Also half their games are always broke but whatever"}
{"text":"You get all games half price on Wed but there are more than 20 machines are out of order. I went to their restaurant and get a text to wait, and they will text you again when table is ready... but never get the second text again. Bad service ever!"}
{"text":"I planned our company event here.   The food was not good at all. Everyone was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Not to mention with the amount of money we paid we could have just order from the regular dinning menu and saved a ton.  *Baked Spinach Dip was served but not chips (we had to ask)  *Honey Glazed Baby Carrots - not good, no one touched it *Boneless wings (we added on) was dry and super hard *Vegan Penne Pasta - No flavor at all  *Grilled Shrimp Skewers - VERY DRY and had no flavor at all *Lemon-Grilled Chicken - tasted like rubber  *Chef Carved Roast Beef Au Jus - (sound so delicious) If you got the one on the top, it was dry and if you got the one at the bottom was very salty.  *Mini Cheesecakes and Chocolate Éclairs - was semi frozen & don't recall getting any Éclairs.   Everyone did enjoy *Salad station, Dinner Rolls, Sweet and Spicy Meatballs & roasted potatoes   I was there on time to taste the food. A couple of people were late and it being in those warmers, made the food dry up vs keeping it warm.   The server was great!!! She did an amazing job!!! Was very on top of everything. One of our co-worker did complain about the food and the manager offered her to order anything on the menu and he will take care of it but she didn't want to order anything because she knew everyone else at the event would have done the same.  This was everyone's first time at this new Dave & Buster's in Las Vegas. It was very small compare to the ones we've held events at in California. A lot of ticket games and not enough video games. The unlimited card was not very useful.   OVER ALL We spent $1,203.78 for 13 people.  So about $92.59 per person. This was not worth what we spent. Not to mention we paid $75 for them to black an area off in their restaurant. We went on a Thursday night and it was dead. You are better off planning an event and having everyone order their own food and drinks. You will save more."}
{"text":"My review is regarding our experience on a Wednesday evening, which has half-price games.   Upon entering the building, there is a front desk that can take care of any questions or start you with a game card. Full restaurant and bowling are on the first floor, and the arcade and a bar (with limited seating) are on the second floor.   The girl working the front was super friendly and helped us get started with a card. We each had $25  gift cards, so we added them purely for games. There is a $2 charge to start a game card, so if you come often, save them. If you don't mind sharing a card, I recommend doing that as well. We decided to share.   For $48 we started with about 280 tokens. Considering each game was half price, that ended up being A LOT. Two of us played anything we wanted for at least an hour and a half, if not closer to two hours. We were surprised time went by so quickly. We ended up leaving with 66.2 tokens left on the card. Most games I saw ranged in the 3-5 tokens range (again, half price).   As far as tickets go, most games pay out at least a few. We weren't really playing for tickets but ended up with 2,200+ by the time we left. If you play for tickets though, I'm sure you could have had many more in the time we spent.   I thought there was a good selection and variety of games. Lots of driving/shooting/action video games like Tomb Raider, Jurassic Park, Alien, Transformers, Batman, Spider-Man, Star Wars. There were classics like Ski Ball, Basketball, Football, Clown Knockdowns. Fun interactive games like Connect Four, Super Trivia, Guitar Hero, \"Beer Pong\". And then of course, a variety of games aimed more at winning tickets, including the ones where you want to push tokens off the ledge, or just random wheel spins.   The servers working the bar looked a little swamped, and when we grabbed a drink no one was particularly friendly. I guess I wouldn't be trying to deal with the craziness either though.   The prize \"store\" has a variety of options, from candy to Knick-knacks to stuffed animals. I thought it was a decent selection for an arcade, but it's pretty much what you expect. Nothing mind blowing here.   For the half price deal, I thought the arcade was well worth it. But I could see during regular times it being a little expensive, especially if you have multiple people who want to play. I'd return on a Wednesday for sure."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing food and drink specials On a Tuesday and happy hour the service is great tonight  I had the hottie burger and man is the heat at the perfect level and the 2 dollar beers to go with it perfect match"}
{"text":"Our bartender Matt was being rude and pretentious towards us, and then serve me a single shot while charging me for a double.  I assumed it was a joke and said no way. He then began a defensive tirade, petulantly showing me how me how he makes a single shot look like a double shot. Matt just blew me away. I remained firm refusing to pay for it, so Matt huffed and puffed, and then ran to the manager, Bryan, to complain about us. Bryan then came over and said,\"Do we have a prob-lem?\", just when I thought this couldn't get more Richard Simmons, I told him this situation was fallacious and that I simply did not want to be charged double for what was a single. When I explained to Bryan how Matt's behavior was getting out of hand, Bryan too began to huff and puff. Essentially, this all happened because I caught a bartender scamming his customers and the manager was in it. I dropped $150 on food and drinks which is probably why this happened. Matt also expected a tip, however, I told him he didn't do his job to my expectations. Nevertheless, after visiting this location hundreds of times since it was a Jillian's 15 years ago, my family and I were kicked out for contending illegal and dishonest behavior by a bartender."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish & chips, when it arrived I found out they don't have any tartar sauce  the games were fun but the wait time was a little excessive"}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Food and drinks take over 40 minutes Grandson is crying waiting for food Waitress forgot coffee. Don't go here Manager came to smooth things over The food is fabulous but it takes to long to get out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"Worst bar in las vegas.  Seven people on the bar and they still manage to ignore you.  What happend with the bartenders here boys and girls are ecualy bad."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this Dave and Buster's. We had our company holiday party there this year.   First skee ball stole the credits on my cards without giving me any balls. Then the minion machine broke on both sides multiple times. I would ask someone to fix it and they would say they would get someone and no one would ever come.   Three nose level was ok when we first got there, but as soon as more people showed up, it got incredibly loud. By the time we left I had a really bad headache.   I probably wouldn't come back here unless it was paid for again."}
{"text":"This is pretty classic spend $40 for a stuffed toy, or in our case, some play sand. Dave and Buster's is a place that our family is familiar with and is a place that both the kids and adults enjoy. Located in the Tempe Marketplace, you won't get away without dropping some cash, but the entertainment value is where your money goes.  Arriving for a late dinner on a Sunday night, we could here the salsa music from the patio upstairs which is unique to this location and haven't seen in any other D&B. It was Havana Night from 6:30-12 where ladies get in for free before 7:30 and there are free salsa lessons with $3 dos equis and $4 mojitos. We were seated immediately in a large booth in the dining area with clear views of UFC Fight Night on the many screens throughout the restaurant. We received great service and I would say the food was pretty mediocre. The food menu is large with American fare along with an equally large drink menu which includes a full margarita, tiki drink, tea, and snow cone beverage section. My wife likes sweet drinks and her strawberry watermelon margarita was perfect for her.  I ordered the steak salad and was pleased with the combination of bleu cheese, candied pecans, and herb vinaigrette to go along with the steak. The meal was part of an eat and play combo which got me the salad plus a card with $20 in play for $30 which was a good deal in my book. Keep your card to reload when you're done because you'll have to pay an activation fee for a new one and the card will also keep track of your ticket count. Also ordered were the: roasted turkey avocado BLT ($10.49), chicken parmesan alfredo ($12.99), and boss chicken club ($10.49). Everyone else finished their food and there were no complaints.  After we bought a $20 card for the kids, we spent about 90 minutes playing games. The nice thing is that if you get a little thirsty there are bars bordering both sides of the gaming area. There are plenty of driving and shooting games where you can compete against your family or others. The younger ones won't be left out either as there is a section of games for them.  If you bring a group, you're not leaving here without spending a chunk of change, but you'll have fun. Every night there are food and drink specials to go along with weekday early and late happy hours. Half priced games on Wednesday nights will take your dollar a little further so you won't have to spend as much for that little stuffed toy."}
{"text":"A lot of fun but watch your food costs. The kids are gonna want to spend a bunch on games and if you are not careful the food bill gets high.  I think they have a deal on Wednesday nights so if you can choose a night go then but be prepared for fun to spend money."}
{"text":"D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.  You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).  Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.  The games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.  Not a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant."}
{"text":"\"Cooked to perfection\" is an overused cliche with restaurant reviews. Luckily, I had no reason to use this term because the entire experience was a disaster at Dave & Buster's.   A colleague and I brought some friends along to celebrate our respective birthdays on this Saturday evening. We felt about as welcome as Larry Nassar at a gymnastics competition.   All of us utilized the 'Eat & Play Combo' to try and save some money on the food and activities. Funny, because we certainly didn't feel like we got to play considering the lack of 'chips' included with the deal. One gentleman in our party didn't even get to eat because the server forgot his food.    As far as the actual cuisine goes, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken with Spicy Thai Peanut Noodles. The dish came off more as a deconstructed chicken strip with a cumsauce reduction on a bed of used condoms. All in all, the meal was subpar.   Finally, the receipts given had different suggested tip options for the various percentages despite the total check amount being the same. Interesting to say the least.  Next time, go to Chuck E Cheese. At least they have decent pizza."}
{"text":"1st time here. The place looked amazing but the food service was terrible. The waitresses were rude and my wings, which were my meal, came out an hour after everyone elses food. For a $75 bill I am mot impressed."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, & decided to sit outside since the weather was nice. 'C', our waitress, greeted us. We asked for water while we looked at the menu; 30 minutes later, no water. We had to go back in and ask what the hold up was. She said and I quote, \"oh, I forgot about you guys!\" After a couple of rounds of endless waiting, we finally received our lukewarm, bland food, which was brought out by someone else. 'C' checked on us one more time, and then she vanished into the night. Her service was so horrible, my boyfriend went looking for her inside and when he finally found her, he had to ask her if it was a busy night for her.  However it wasn't; she was just chatting it up with the regulars I guess. He said that was the first time that he did not leave a tip. We've been to other Dave & Busters with great service. This one was the pits."}
{"text":"I love Dave and Busters, discovered years ago in St.Louis, I was so excited when it was built in Tempe.  I had gone here a few years back after opening and the food was great.  Went last Saturday night and had the worse experience ever.  Do not put photos of your food on a menu and then deliver something that doesn't come close to looking the same. Ordered nachos from the share menu and the plate was a joke.  Not enough for the group, barely had any chips or toppings, and was garnished with brown guac and Lettuce??? who puts lettuce on nachos. I was mad!  The rest of our food was barely edible, had soggy sliders because of the dumb pickle they put on top, gross!  It was busy so they sat us in banquet overflow, we were hungry so went for it, but bad idea, room was cold and away from everything, and ugly! Of course we went for the games, which is so expensive. Spent a hundred dollars on cards for the kids.  Which last less than 30 minutes.  Underwhelming and will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's huge! Compared to the dave and busters back home, this is double in size! They have an upstairs with an outdoor deck with a huge bar. Super cool. They have awesome private dining rooms for dinner parties. Service was good. Dinner was good. The games were good. Tons of tvs to catch games. No complaints here."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in the year 2016, the lack of vegetarian and vegan options is shocking. Don't go here if you are a vegan, there is literally nothing here to eat. They had a decent veggie burger which was actually quite good. But, they have since replaced that on the menu with this gross portobello mushroom burger which is slimy and completely unappetizing."}
{"text":"Not a first timer here but still not the greatest service. I usually sit at the bar for Sunday football and even for a beer I waited 10 minutes for someone to take my order. Then within the hour I ordered food (boneless wings and fries) and 40 minutes later come to find out my order was never placed. For the only D&B's in Vegas and it being Sunday football you would think their service would be on point by now. They are lucky they have games or else I wouldn't waste my time anymore!"}
{"text":"I had a positive attitude when i came here for dinner, i really wanted to like the food but it was just a total let down. go figure eh' ? You can't have an establishment that has fun games and good food under one roof. The menu and food can (in my opinion) be looked at like an upgraded Applebee's menu. B/f steak was not cooked the way he ordered it, the Nachos we had to start were the best part of the meal. ( But nachos are good at any sports function so you don't need to be on Iron Chef to whip up a good batch of em').. i got the BLTA sandwich and honestly how can you mess up such a classic sandwich???? i was just overall not impressed at all and even kind of mad that i had to pay for it..."}
{"text":"This review only reflects on my experience at D&B as a whole.*  For a Toronto attraction destination, you can't expect D&B to serve food that will blow you away. A place like this that  you'll expect paying 10$ for a slice of pizza. BUT, the food menu in D&B is not only extensive ranging from a variety of drinks, apps, salads, burgers,sandwiches.. only to name a few.  After their renovation, D&B has really stepped it up. The bar and dining room accommodates easily 500 people, service for food did not slow down.  Their bar is a graet place to catch any game or fight, Tvs are big enough you don't have to squint your eyes if you're in the back of the room.  If the guys brought their gfs and they don't want to watch the game/fight, arcade and pool is also available.   Prizes in D&B are decent, as 1 ticket=$0.01 for the face value of the prize which could be bought by customers if they don't have sufficient tickets. Anything ranging from toys suitable for kids at any age to adult toys (not that kind of adult toys, I was thinking about PS3)   D&B is a great place to host any event, birthday parties, or a date!"}
{"text":"Over priced, rude staff, if they are not in the mood to serve you it truly shows.  No one looks happy."}
{"text":"To sum this up, we came here on a weekday shortly after opening and our food took forever and when we got it, it was cold. I honestly thought they microwaved it. Two stars because our server actually checked on us once and refilled my husband's drink. The games are fun, lots of variety, but this review is about the restaurant/food itself."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun with my co-workers playing all the games during our holiday party. This location doesn't have as many games or variety as the D&B location in Concord, but with that being said the parking and traffic situation is a lot more appealing (and is much closer to work).   After consulting with at least 10 people including myself, the catered family style buffet left a lot to be desired.. Food was lackluster at best. A slight redemption came with mini edible desserts. The peppermint cake was by far, my favorite!  Before we ate, there was a presentation- no one could hear anything due to the loud noise of games, people at other functions and at the bar. Also the laptop was projected onto a small television not a large screen, which was not optimal.   I would definitely go back to play games with friends / family and order off the regular menu."}
{"text":"The hostess was professional. We were seated quick. Then all went south. Waited 40 mins to get order taken. This is after I asked to see a manager. Manager came over and offered me a free spinach dip. WHAT??!   My time is worth a whole spinach dip. The staff that took our order was good.   The place was understaffed as stated by wait staff that they had seen we were not being tended to. The management team needs better training. They seem a bit unprepared to deal with conflict. Very unseasoned. Not their fault at all. There is always a guy at the top who needs to train them better.   The food was very good. The serving staff was good. Albeit the manager did the best she could under the circumstances. If it was my joint. Get people in and served quickly so they have time to enjoy the gaming experience also. What should have been a 30 or 40 minute dining experience turned in to 1 and a half almost 2 hour dining experience. Think of how much more people could have dined instead of me and my family being tied to a table for almost two hours.   Room for a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Waited 10 mins after we sat down to get our drink orders, then we asked for boneless wings and we got bone in wings, then I got uncooked bacon with my Mac and cheese and to top it off they were short staffed and it took forever to get refills, no wonder this location has 2 stars on yelp.  Not eating here again."}
{"text":"I will start by saying it was very slow when I was there.   This may be why I had a great experience.    So, I love Dave and Buster's.   I lived close to one in Pittsburgh at one point and it was always fun.   I love their drinks as well as their food, and the games are always fun.   I also love arcades, which is weird because I don't like video games.      So, we started by eating.    The food was good, but our service was not the best.    Our server had a large group and went back to their table 4 times before doing a drink order for us.   She also never checked in with us when we got our food. Otherwise, the food side was a solid 3.  The games though we're awesome.   I was excited to try games I never got to play before.   They even had a beer pong game.    I had a problem finding my card and it seems that we lost my last tickets.    The manager did try to rectify this, but it seems she is unable.   But, I am thankful she tried.    This place is definitely a game place first."}
{"text":"We came during Happy Hour and were seated right away. Milan was the sweetest waiter and was always on top of our orders and drinks. She came back to let us know the status if it has been awhile. Our party enjoyed the triple play, grilled smoked chicken, chicken lettuce raps, and carnivore pizzadilla. The food tasted like the usual, but she gave us the best experience for my first time here! Thank you Milan! (:"}
{"text":"We went to this place to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.    All my Irish born husband wanted to do on This St. Patrick's Day was have a few...  Ok (many, many) drinks and play five hours of pool with his brother in-law   We accomplished that and had fun, despite the less than courteous bartender.  She was over worked and alone, so I can understand why she was unfriendly.  The place was very crowded.  Lots of teenagers and kids literally running amuck.  The place was a madhouse!  The drinks were watered down past the point of reason, but the wings were good.   This is not the place for me, because I don't like crowds.  I also don't like to see people being spread so thin.    I am sure I am not their target audience anyhow.  So no love lost."}
{"text":"I love video games and we had a D&B card that we purchased in Hawaii while on our honeymoon.  We decided to see how much was left on the card and kill some time this afternoon.  Turns out we had like 20 bucks left on it so we played a bunch of games.  We played some racing games, some skeeball, some basketball, air hockey etc.  They even have this virtual reality ride/game thing.  2 people sit in these reclining chairs, you pay your money, then you get to pick 6 scenarios to \"play\".  We chose the spooky mine ride and some car racer game.  Basically you sit back and watch this screen in front of you, all the while your chair moves, fans blow on you to simulate wind etc.  It was pretty cool.  It kind of jerked you around in some parts though and my head was banging against the headrest.  I didnt like that aspect of it but other than that it was fine.   Oh yeah....I played a shitload of The Claw games....I am pretty good at them and love playing them.  I got 3 bears in uniform...Red Sox, Phillies and Cavs, as well as a bowling pin looking animal for my dog Chief to play with when we get back.  It was a solid Dave and Busters and we had fun while we were there."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes for our server to greet us. Over an hour for food to come out. Server was MIA for about 25 minutes. Steak was undercooked and full of gristle.  Server wouldn't take our plates when we finished and to top it off, our power card didn't work properly."}
{"text":"Went for a UFC fight, the back showing room was full So they turned some tvs to the fights in the main bar. For that, 5 stars"}
{"text":"This location is a bit smaller than the normal one we visit which is in Concord NC. But over all a fair experience. Also, the staff that I did have interaction with seem to be very pleasant."}
{"text":"The food quality has definitely gone down. The new sitting arrangement they have sucks! You now have to wait to be seated by the hostess, problem is the wait time to be seated is always so long. Seems like they are always short staffed. As you look around all of the tables seem to be dirty. (See pictures). The staff for the most part is pleasant. A fun place to go, would just like to see faster service, a cleaner environment and better food. They have added new things to the menu however they were out of chicken and waffles which is what I planned to try! There was 4 please in my party and everyone sent their food back for one reason or another!"}
{"text":"The environment was safe with police being there and clean, especially with all the people in there on a Wednesday evening. However,  we sat in the bar and had a server named Mario. He greeted the table after 5-10 minutes of waiting around, didn't get our drink orders until about 5-10 mins after that. During the course of the entire meal, never once did our server look us in the eyes,  explain any specials, say hapy birthday to my boyfriend when I mentioned we were here celebrating his birthday with you guys, and or checked on us. We ordered a burger with fries and ranch and a side salad with ranch. The side salad was not fresh (brown soggy lettus, the tomatoes were mushy, and the mozz cheese on a side garden salad was gross and not complimentary to the plate.). My boyfriend ordered a burger Medium well and it came out medium rare. Food came out decently quickly by a food runner.  Server practically ignored our table the entire time. Never checked to seeif the salad or burger was okay,  never offered us refills. Once the drinks are half full, if its free refills bring a refill without asking. Once food hits the table wait 2-3 minutes and check on table. Finally, the server came over to drop off the check, not even make sure we were kay after 20-30 minutes. Anyways, the food was horrible. I went and got a manager involved and he was nice and took off the salad and the dessert we had ordered. Our server, Mario was horrible, rude, and needs to be retrained. We will NOT be eating there again, but def will be back to play some more games.  Very disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  The service was awful.  The games were fun and the family had a great time.  But the food was super disappointing."}
{"text":"I have met friends here on a couple of occasions now.  Rarely do I order food as I usually just sit and have a few drinks at the front bar and this last time we hung out at the bar on the other side of the arcade near the party rooms.  The bar service is usually slow or overwhelmed.  The food is typical of other chains like Applebees or TGIFridays.   I have a card with reward credits and a few game credits.  I get bored easily with the games and when I go look at the prizes, there's nothing that's screams  cool...I want to play more games to win it...except maybe those grillz...ya know the bling bling for your teeth...I've got some tickets town win... Hummmm..."}
{"text":"Love Dave and busters. We were so excited when they decided to open a location in Vegas.   We went opening day and service was still working out the kinks but overall it was good. Got our food a little slow but taste was on par with other locations and server was apologetic.  We have been back since a few times and they have it all working well. Clean new machines and friendly energetic staff."}
{"text":"Very loud, not very friendly staff. We put in our name for a table and the hostess said it would be thirty minutes, after 20 we went back inside and the same woman said it would still be another 30 minutes. Really not worth it so we left."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a bit late, thinking it was going to stay open as other Dave & Busters in california, but was wrong, they close way to early when other venues are still open across the way.  This Dave & Busters is a bit smaller then the other locations, but still does the job, i did not taste their food, i am sure it is just like any other D&B and the drinks were just as good.  Staff was helpful and polite to my request to have a few rounds before their closing time.  Only problem i see here is that it closes way to early, stay open longer guys!  Great Location though."}
{"text":"I went in August around 3.30 pm 16 seat at the bar you  have 8 Bartenders walking in circles after 15 minutes I call somebody if can I get a beer he ask if anybody  approach I say not after the beer j ask if he can take my order he reply I am in the other side but I will in mentioned to the others  Bartenders then I ask for a supervisor of Mgr. he can in apologizes for waiting to long still wait over 20 minutes for the food no Bartender asked me for a second beer or if I want another one I call again another bartender If I can order a food to go he put the order in the computer ,after 25 minutes I ask him if my sandwich is coming he was surprised my food didn't arrived again the manager approach in ask me what is wrong now with little attitude I explained him how you have 8 people behind the bar and nobody ask for anything or check back he not even apologizes he mentioned he will give discount on the beer which I don' t expecting nothing for free this is not a type of Service for a Summerlin Area plus I have to take the manager attitude which I don't need hope you change the way you do business sincerely A.Luna"}
{"text":"Amongst the worst resturaunt experiences that my family has ever had. I'd give it 0 stars if that were possible. First off, it took nearly an hour to get a table but we were okay with that since we decided to play first. It then took a while to get our drinks, we were okay with that too because once again, it was busy. Here's where it went downhill fast, we weren't given straws for the drinks. It was a problem considering the kids cups have lids on them. We flag someone down to get us straws and he brings one... I explained that the whole table needed straws thinking my bad that I may have not made that known. Yeah, he literally brought another single straw. Our family giggled because it was a little mind boggling but whatever. Food came in at a decent time but we didn't have any silverware and our waitress was standing talking to another table...for at least 15 minutes. The manager in the mean time was bussing the table next to us. Like where are the bussers? We let the server know that we didn't have any silverware and we asked for some ketchup and ranch. He then made the comment of oh wow you guys don't have anything on your table! Well yeah that's why we asked you. We sat there waiting to eat because we needed forks and at this point we just asked the manager who was still cleaning the table next to us. He brought out the silverware and everything else we needed including refills because once again waitress was mia. The server then comes back with the silverware a little too late because the manager had already done it. We ate the food, which wasn't bad but we never actually received the ranch that was asked for numerous times. We had to once again flag someone down for more refills since the waitress decided again to hang out at the other table and guess who brought the refills....the manager. We let the manager know that hey she hasn't really done anything and has been standing at the other table for a while now. I honestly felt bad for the manager because he was working his tail off and his staff is useless. The waitress did make it back one more time to say sorry, is there anything else and here's the check. Food was okay, service was absolutely terrible. We will definitely be back to play games and that's it."}
{"text":"I am upping my rating from last time. I was here recently for a work function...and this time we had a barrage of appetizers....lots of sliders, wings, mini pizzas, cookies, fruits....they got them all. Wish I ate more but I got to take care of my girly figure."}
{"text":"Good food for an arcade style place.  We have eaten here a couple of times and each time we have enjoed enjoyed our meals.  Today we had the calamari as an appetizer and I had California turkey club which was also decent.  Oh yeah they also have a ton of tvs and lots of fun games."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and always had problems with the food service. Tonight's visit took the win.  The service began on a low note as all the open tables hadn't been cleaned, and I had to approach two people before being directed to an open CLEAN table. After being seated the server was attentive and was quick to grab our drinks, only after this had the service begin to decline. After receiving the the food, it was average, a lot better quality can be found for a cheaper price else where.  However, after receiving the bill I discovered I had been charged for extra ranch. No where on the menu or had a server notified me a side of sauce would be extra. I'm not unhappy if I have to pay a couple extra cents, I'm simply disturbed I'm not notified that there would be an extra charge and how RUDELY my server had responded to this complaint. \"Well everywhere you go will charge you for sauce\", instead of apologizing for the inconvenience she continues to argue with me. No restaurant I visit including fast food has charged me extra for a side of sauce including previous visits to this Dave and busters location, this was a first. Whenever I visit a restaurant chain such as chilies for example, they'll be unlimited in what they provide without hesitation and WITHOUT CHARGE.  Whether you agree or disagree with a customer, it's extremely UNPROFESSIONAL to argue with them. Upon speaking to the manager about Courtney's attitude problem. The manager didn't care to introduce himself or share his name. He was reluctant and unsure of what change he could do to improve our visit and he didn't apologize for the actions the server chose to make.  Aside, from all the dilemma in the food section. The prize booth at this location is always out of prizes, I'm greeted with the expression \"well next week we'll restock\". Not there fault, more of just a constant inconvenience.  The environment is also dirty and UNSAFE for children. There was pieces of broken glasses of drinks from the bar around the skee ball machine that a child easily could've gotten hurt on. The bathrooms were also FILTHY, with toilet paper all over the floor.  I don't recommend this location for Dave and Busters and will no longer be returning. I don't feel like a well respected customer when expressing my opinion to them."}
{"text":"So...I've had my 2nd let down with Dave and Buster's in less than a two month time frame. First was in mid - March when my boyfriend and I went to celebrate his birthday. We took the kids for dinner and expected to spend between $150-200...well...the food tasted like it was made in a microwave. It was sent back twice and we eventually received a credit. This was after waiting 15 minutes and not been greeted by our server. Dinner was a bust but the kids had a great time playing video games in the arcade. So...we went back tonight for my son's birthday (no dinner...just for the arcade). We got there after having dinner elsewhere around 9pm. We were told that the children would have to be out of the building by 10pm, even though they were with an adult. It would have been great if that was listed on the website, which we checked before driving the 45 mins to get to the location. Needless to say, my baby was disappointed because we couldn't stay since they wouldn't have anytime to play. We will be driving the extra 30 minutes to go to Frankie ' s Fun Park in Columbia going forward.  If the children hadn't enjoyed the arcade games, there would be no stars for this review."}
{"text":"This is a low key spot with bartenders that make you feel like you're the shit. I really didn't want to tell people about this to keep it to myself but these bartenders deserve the world!"}
{"text":"The food was ok here. Nothing to write on about. It is standard food chain fare. Expect burgers and entrees similar to what you would find at Applebees or TGI Fridays.  The arcade section upstairs is ok. Most of the games are overpriced and all of which require that you purchase a token card.   This is a decent place to go to once or twice but not much to keep me going back."}
{"text":"Great for parents and kids to eat play and interact with each other on a even playing field. Sports and arcade with food and booze. Top it all off great staff. Always ask for Shawn in the dining room."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but overpriced food, small portions and poor service. I can't imagine going back here."}
{"text":"Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill.   Next, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda.   The games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.  Overall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Games are games at any Dave & busters but service makes or breaks this place. I understand it was busy tonight because of the fight, but that's no excuse for rude employees... Especially multiple employees, hostesses, waitresses, and bus boys. The manager on the other hand was great and gave us a very reasonable explanation for a server being very rude. Either way, on a Saturday night, I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely AMAZING! We were unaware of the fights that night and we planned a birthday party for about 30 guests in hopes that we arrived an hour early and they would accommodate us. Absolutely they did even with it being fight night! We were originally told an hour and a half but they just do happen to have a big group of tables open up at the same time and they were going to give us that area and even held it for us until most of our guests arrived. Totally not what I was expecting that's for sure. They were so wonderful and so accommodating, the food was delicious as always.   We understood why they were charging for the fight as its very open concept and anywhere you go in there you can see a tv so how are they supposed to accommodate people who are only there for \"games and a bite.\"  Besides that you got the money back on a game card that played the arcade games you just couldn't win any tickets with the cards. Believe me when I say when that fight was on, the entire place stood still watching it so of course they were charging to get in. They pay a lot of money to show those fights and they have to get something in return. It's a business for Christ's sake. Yes it's loud but it's an ARCADE/SPORTS BAR! It's not an effing library people! Man!   I believe Dave and Busters handled our situation extremely well and the service was amazing. The manager was also awesome.   And no, I don't work for them I just had an absolutely amazing experience."}
{"text":"I go here a lot, usually on Wednesday because they have the best happy hour with half off games and drinks.   The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because the food is hit or miss.  The buffalo chicken sliders are good, and so is the calamari.   Some of the other items were disappointing. I got a meal on the menu it was ribs, fries, and one other item, I think wings. From the picture you can see the ribs and the fries are in the same container, I don't care if my food touches each other my issue was they don't toss the ribs in sauce they pour it on them when they are with the fries so your fries are covered in BBQ sauce. Not a good combo to me, I usually give my son the fries but he wouldn't eat them with so much BBQ sauce.  Also the food can be inconsistent, the first time I got the nachos they were huge, last time I went they made the plate so small, that by myself I ate over half and I'm not a big eater, the first time I didn't even make a dent in them. (They are supposed to serve 2-4 people).   Also the first time I got the pizza bites they were awesome, another time the bread was hard.   There is one bartender who always waits on us, I wish I had his name, he gives the best service and is really attentive even when it is busy. I always sit on the side he is serving. The drinks are always awesome even when I say \"I don't know just make me something\".   My friend was in town for one night and I told her we should go here and we did and she was surprised at how low the bill was and said I'm glad you thought of this place.   On a side note I left my phone on one of the games one night and was almost in tears thinking I'd never get it back. (When you get iPhone through pre-paid services you pay full price so my outdated iPhone cost me around 350) I went to the front desk and someone had turned it in. It's good to know even the other people who go here are kind hearted."}
{"text":"Good times at the Dave & Busters :) we went for a family day out with our daughter who is almost 3 . She had the time of her life . We had lunch played in the game area For about 3 hrs and spent about $70 not bad of a deal at all . We left with lots of little cheap toys and a cute hello kitty stuffed animal all for about 840 points . We will definitely be going back for more fun hopefully one night we can leave the kids at hm :) a good mix of fun for all ages ."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night around 10pm and there was a  lineup to get into D&B! Very busy! Croud age around 22-26yrs. Awesome prizes to win!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food was fantastic. Many odd menu items only found here. Haven't been here in years and was pleasantly surprised at the food. If you're there before 7 go get a $10'game pass and use it after dinner for an hour of unlimited gaming!  The linguini shrimp and steak was fantastic and the bacon wrapped shrimp is a must to try."}
{"text":"Food was fine. This location has the worst customer service of any location I have ever experienced. Inattentive wait staff and it's at half capacity. Beer spilled in the game room with a caution sign in place but never cleaned up. Not good"}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun.   Here to celebrate the birthday of one of my son's friends. Be warned...Saturday afternoons can be PACKED! We arrived early enough to beat the crowd.   I was pleasantly surprised by the food...and drinks. Pretty tasty and the menu was extensive. We had wings and sliders. Wings have a kick so they aren't for amateurs. And the sliders inspired me to go buy Hawaiian rolls and make some myself! They were really tasty.   Bring your wallets. The kids will want to pack their cards to pack in the games!"}
{"text":"I've tried many items here and have always had good food.  I usually only go for lunch for some fun with my food, so it isn't busy and service is fast.  The few times I've gone at night the place is packed which is bad for service and for waiting for the good games to open up.  Wednesday's are half-priced games which helps keep the prices reasonable, but all that does is pack the place with kids when there is no school."}
{"text":"For the record a lot of these negative reviews are ridiculous! If you want fine dining this is not the place for you...obviously! This is a place for fun, games and something to munch on and a place to have drinks with friends....  It was myself, my mother and my 7 year old. The games were awesome, connect four, battle pac-man, star wars, jurassic park are all a must try. Cost of games a little pricy but hey when it comes to having fun you're there to make memories and enjoy the moment and be happy you have that opportunity. We ordered only appetizers/starters: calamri: hey were in the middle of the dessert and definitely not on the coast lines so it was edible, perfectly fried, not too much batter and the dipping sauce is delicious. Potato skins were alright, could have used bigger potatoes since they were Idaho potatoes but it hit the spot. My 7 year old snacked on Edamame and we shared the sweet potato fries. Both were delicious. And it arrived to the table in a timely manner. Oh for drinks my mom had a club soda with lime, little one orange juice and I had a virgin Mojito (ask for it with half sprite & half club soda) ...no complaints. We all had a fun and delicious time. It's the only property I have been to that is two floors. 1st floor has a bar with full dining room and a bowling alley in the back. 2nd floor has a bar with a few booths and all the games including a separate room with pool tables. And our menus and our booth was clean as a whistle. Our waitress did not bug us at all. She took our order, and checked back , than when we were done dropped the check and even got us to go boxes with a bag since she noticed we didn't finish everything....left a 22% tip. I was in the hospitality & restaurant business for over 10 years and I approve this message. Haha. Just go have fun guys , opinions are like butt holes....everyobe has one! ;-p P.S: the staff was friendly, the place was clean but the ladies restroom stalls need some extra taking care of. Peace out ..."}
{"text":"We went here last night, the service was not bad. The beer was good. The games were decent, it is still older versions, which is not bad depends on what you like."}
{"text":"The little kid in me loves coming to this place for some heavy gaming. Whether it be racing horses, cars or playing basketball and some classic arcade games...this is the spot to come.  They're drinks aren't the cheapest, but buying 20oz beers is probably your best bet. They give you a rechargeable token card which can be dangerous since you don't realize how few tokens you have left until you need to buy more. Lol but it's nice because you can store that card in your wallet if you're maxed out on gaming for your next visit, the card doesn't expire.  The guy that works the front counter where you buy your coins is really sweet and tries to get you the best deal for what you're looking to do while your there. (His name is Alex I believe?) While they do have a bar it's a cool place to take kids for some gaming during the day. Haven't had a chance to check out their restaurant unfortunately, but maybe I'll check that out at the next visit."}
{"text":"Fun place to go when you're with a group of friends.  A variety of games to play in the arcade and it's extremely fun. The points on your charge card for games go down quick due to each game costing a bit different so watch out!  Just a heads up, the drinks are a bit pricey and the food is nothing to be excited about. Pretty generic. Beware of high traffic times as that's when the games area gets hectic and the load time for cards is long as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and I have a wonderful time, and great food every time.  I consider this place the adult Chuck-E-Cheese at night, but during the day, I would happily bring (and have brought) my kids here.  We get here when they first open, and enjoy a family lunch in the TV room.  Then, after charging our cards, we enjoy the arcade.  Fast, friendly service.  Clean and neat place.  Bathrooms in working order and Valet parking at night.  Yeah, I love this place."}
{"text":"We were here to attend a company holiday party. The food was buffet style and consisted of salad, rice with pineapple, carrots, green beans and chicken with a super yummy sauce. After reading some of the food reviews I was pleasantly surprised. We also had access to shuffleboard and pool tables. For the most part the service was very good with the exception of one guy who asked if we wanted change after we paid a $12 bill with a $20...um duh!"}
{"text":"The service here is just terrible. You can see all the servers hanging around and bullshitting, while you try to flag someone down to get a receipt. The food is alright, but just be aware that you'll be here awhile waiting, and waiting, and waiting for your server to come around. It wasn't even all that busy when we were here."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great time even though they were a little stingy on the tickets!!! Great place for a little fun. Restrooms were just ok, not a clean as I would like them to be."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple dozen beverages before a concert in the square.  Great selection of beers and a friendly staff. Having a great time, then Hank walked in.  I was playing some games and I saw him and another dude inside the star wars game, making out.  I don't care about 2 dudes enjoying each other, but Hank?  Come on. I saw the guy he was with, that dude could do much better than Hank.  I recommend Dave & Busters. I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Love coming here! I love how you can come here to eat, drink + play games. I came here a few times, but on my last visit, the experience was pretty good!   We had dinner, and our food was amazing! I was vege that day, but was craving pasta + they made sure there was no meat, yet the pasta dish tasted amazing :) Also, if you love mojitos, then you should def. try the passionfruit mojito!   Game wise, this place is so much fun! However, I feel like they need to add more games, and get better prizes. Compared to my last visit, felt like they hardly had prizes to choose from + some areas looked empty because there wasn't a lot of games.  Other than that, I will def. be back :)"}
{"text":"Not only was this place extremely dirty (tables un-bused, napkins everywhere on the ground, peoples empty drinks laying around), its way over priced for the \"fun\" you get out of it. Maybe if I was drinking and didn't care about my surroundings it would have been a bit different. Probably wont be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"My hubby and  I decided to grab a a late lunch at DB after his visit at the VA on 3/30/18 at Concord Mills Mall.  It took forever for our orders to come out. My hubby was famished as he is going through chemo treatment and had just had minor eye surgery. He ordered Philly cheesesteak and I ordered thai chicken salad and a couple glasses of sweet tea.  The cheesesteak was just ok. My salad came without the marinated chicken, filled with kale and not the salad greens as indicate on the menu and the chips on top were over cooked. The manager Josh took the salad off our ticket per the waiter with the grey blonde braids.  You could have taken the tea off as well for all the time that waited . Very poor customer skills , you need to go back to training.  We will never visit DB for food again."}
{"text":"Went to Dave and Busters to watch the UFC on ppv. Very nice that they didn't charge us cover and it wasn't hard to make reservations. The menu was with a good variety. Bar food and also food for fine dining. I ordered the half rack with veggies. The food was somewhat sub par. The half rack of ribs did not necessarily fall off the bone. In fact you had to crank it off. The vegetables did not have any flavoring and was steamed. The decor was nice but they need to address the tv sightlines. The lighting fixtures would block the tv for viewing. and the projector is blocked by concrete columns. The waitress was not that attentive but attentive enough. The manager who said was going to greet me did not. I would come back here to watch the ufc though and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Finally a game spot very close to were I live here in Vegas. Usually the spot was gameworks, but this place is more poppin. I came here for the first time on a Sunday night still a little busy around 10pm. It was half off all drinks so my Magarita and Sangria was only $12. The bar area is really huge and the dining area as well. Didn't come here to eat but maybe next time will try their food. I just ordered the Donut bite dessert which was really good. The game choices were limited but I think they are extending it even more.   It's still busy at the moment but sooner or later it will die down. Great area for groups to just hangout and have some fun. Will come back to play more games and buy the $50 for 300 points to play some more my next visit.  Tip: Wednesday all day is Half off games !!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times to play games in the arcade, and was surprisingly impressed with the food and drinks!   I had the strawberry watermelon margarita, which is made with Souza Blue Agave tequila, watermelon puckers, watermelon purée, lemonade and strawberry purée ice cubes (which kept the drink from getting watered down)! It was a great drink!   For dinner, I got the short rib and mac and cheese sandwich, and it pretty amazing! The meat had great BBQ flavor and paired well with Mac and cheese on the sandwich!   For dessert, we all split the \"Brookie\", which is a glorious combination of brownies and cookies, stacked with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup and caramel sauce!!!  it was enough for 5 of us to share!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about Dave and Busters are the drinks the service is mediocre at best the food is nothing to talk about I rather eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"d & b finally in vegas! excited to see how it transforms over the years! #fightnight charged a $10 cover on big nights. But that's understandable. Can't wait for memory making time."}
{"text":"4pm on a Friday afternoon and I got turned away for being 8 days under 21 I had no intention drinking and there was all of 4 people in the place even if I was 21 I would go to rivers downtown it's not like they can put a wristband saying I'm 20 or anything."}
{"text":"Place is so much fun. Go on a Wednesday afternoon for the half off games. Food is a bit pricey but after a few drinks i'm sure you won't notice. Prizes are pretty cool so make sure you win you somes. Oh and if you see that freaking Asian man on the drop ball machine not leave for two hours, make sure to tell him that you too want to drop some balls and to move his damn chair it's not a damn casino."}
{"text":"This place is almost perfect, if there was a 4.5 I'd give it that.  I don't know how you cannot have fun with food, alcohol and video games.  I love the trivia game there.  Fun times."}
{"text":"I love Dave and Buster's.  This location is great because they have the \"Deal or No Deal\" game.  Plus all the other cool games like the trivia, etc."}
{"text":"I stupidly decided to have my son's 9th birthday party at this location. It was a small \"party\" nothing to get overly stressed out about...well, unless you are our server who literally looked like our presence ruined her entire year. It started with showing up to zero organization, no one knowing their head from their..and topped off with our server rolling her eyes, acting put out when we needed something or simply trying to avoid our table at every pass. The \"party\" was supposed to end at 5. There was 4 of us adults sitting at the table continuing to order drinks and spend MONEY when we were informed we needed to leave the table due to a shift change??? We got up, moved all the gifts, etc to another table just to look at our first table sit empty. Shift change? We had the SAME server the entire time even after the move. The best part was while moving all the crap over to the other table I had the pleasure of listening to a couple 20 somethings complaining that we were still there when the party was due to end at 5. My apologizes. Spending money at a place of business was so rude. I asked them in the middle of their complaining if they wanted us to leave, looking stunned they insisted no, however had another girl join in the complaining and continued on. The food sucked, the service was bad at best and the only reason I gave 2 stars was because the manager went out of his way to make up for his staff's ridiculous behavior. Thanks but no thanks, I won't be back. I would suggest main event over this over priced circus."}
{"text":"First time coming, tons of open tables, 1-2 hour wait, seriously?? Wow don't think I'll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We love Dave & Busters and have been to several locations in other states. This D&B was actually pretty damn clean for late on a Saturday night compared to other locations. We were there until about 1:30am and started the night off with some food and bev. Sadly, we found ourselves seated and waiting to order for a solid 15 min. We were seated on the outskirts of the bar area so it was challenging to flag down or even see waitstaff... We finally got up and found someone to help.   Skyler came over and made sure that we had everything we needed from there on in. He was super-friendly and apologetic for the first impression and we appreciated that he didn't just hand over the responsibility to someone else. He even bussed the table for us and followed up regularly to make sure we were doing okay. The extra effort and attentiveness really made all the difference in the world.   The food was good, despite the other reviews I read. Granted we just had an assortment of apps, the ribs we super yummy and I must go back for more!! Sweet with a nice kick.   Over-all it was a fun night, the drinks were sooo good! Every time we went up to the bar for more, all of the bartenders were just as happy and enthusiastic to help.   We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on two occasions while visiting Phoenix Can't really say how the food is. We just had drinks  Drink prices are average and drinks are fairly strong  Friendly bar staff   Lots of games etc However it is a for sure teen crowd on a Saturday..."}
{"text":"One of the loudest D&B I've ever been to. At night, it's a deafening roar of people & machines  - opening is the only time it's quiet enough to hear yourself think.   There's no way I'd eat at this location as it shares the same floor with all of the games. The games are crowded together on a smaller footprint than other D&Bs I've been to, making for a cramped experience. It's basically chaos.  What irks me the most is the no outside water bottles policy. I came in about half an hour after they opened to grab Brian to go to lunch after I got done with a class at Sephora. I had a water bottle that was half full and I was stopped and told I couldn't come in. Why? As if I'm sneaking vodka in? In the words of St. Peter in Acts 2:15 \"These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine (10!) in the morning!\" Nobody is trying to get crunk at a D&B on the DL before noon, so don't make me chug my water at the door. (As if D&B is pressed for coin...)  I wouldn't come to this location in the future and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Standard bar/pub fare.   Games are overpriced, prizes are seriously lacking, and game maintenance is terrible. The night I went, only 1/6 skee ball lanes were operational and numerous other games were out of order. If you're charging such a high price to play these games, make sure they're working! Also, the redemption value of tickets is ridiculous. $30 worth of game credits gets you a couple pieces of candy? It seems like you'd have to spend $200 to walk out of there with anything bigger than a shot glass. Also, there are almost no prizes to choose from, shelves are empty and whatever is left is damaged goods. This place has seriously gone downhill. I'd avoid it."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to my very handsome son. This was his bday choice and we had not been in awhile. everything is so expensive but it was worth it. the food has gotten better since the last time i was there last year. i would like to see pizza on the menu to cut down on ordering multiple meals for every one. overall we had a great time. the Michigan game was on just about all the TV's so iwas very happy about that. great experience."}
{"text":"We had SO much fun at D&B's! I really wish they would open a location in Henderson, because Downtown Summerlin is just too far for me to be able to frequent this place. My boyfriend and I had a daytime date here a few weeks ago, just before seeing a movie next door. We fell in love with the huge Pacman game and basically kicked butt. The staff was really friendly, and I like that you can choose to have your tickets uploaded to your card instead of printed.  We look forward to going back and eating, this time around we only grabbed a quick cocktail from the bar - prices were reasonable and the selection was good.   Overall, we had a lot of fun and look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Great location. Not set up like the older Dave and busters so it is small. Food is average like a chilis or Applebee's but they do have a unique menu. I had the short rib Mac n cheese stacker. It was good. Little bland. The Tator tots were good but salty. Kids meals are small portions."}
{"text":"The arcade is really fun it is packed VERY PACKED on Saturdays mostly lots of African American is anyone wants to know the food is not very good I'd rather eat Chikfila service is a 2 on 1-5 scale could be better the \"buffalo wings\" are more salty than spicy and not served hot"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with the service. My wife and I where our enjoying an afternoon of shopping when we decided to stop in and get something to eat.  We arrived around 3:00 and got sat immediately because ironically on a Saturday no one is sitting in the bar with college football on. Anyway our sever came didn't introduce herself. Didn't let us know if there where any specials or drink specials nothing. Just what can I get you to drink. That was a huge red flag!! We ordered Iced Tea and then we had to track her down for straws and sweetener. Now mind you there is no one in the bar area other than one other couple and they had their food all ready so we should be the priority. My wife ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the BBQ Burger \"medium rare!!!\" With onion rings instead of fries. Our food came out, my wife's food was just as she ordered and was hot. Mine on the other hand was another story. First the burger I ordered was \" medium rare\" and it came out well done. I got fries that where cold and I didn't order fries  I finally got the onion rings I ordered but that was way after our food came.  Honestly I felt that we where an inconvenience to our server because her conversation with her fellow employees was more important that focusing on the customer. My wife  and I were  very disappointed in Marlene's performance and would not come back knowing that we would get terrible service like that again."}
{"text":"fun place, lots of different types of games, good drinks, waitresses will look around to find you if you order a drink from them."}
{"text":"I've heard great things from my friends about Dave and Busters for years, but I was not at all impressed on this first visit. Even for typical bar food from a chain, the food was not good: the guac was super pasty and flavorless; the loaded nachos looked awful - nothing like the photo; the fries and chips were subpar; and there really aren't many options for vegetarians, let alone vegans.   The service was incredibly slow. It took forever to even order drinks and then the wait for the food was long as well - appetizers and entrees all came at once. Some of the bathroom stalls were also missing toilet paper and the sinks looked like they needed a cleaning, even though it wasn't even that busy.   On to the games: About a quarter of the game floor was dedicated to games you can play on mobile devices, which I just don't understand. Sure, there were classics like Skeeball, DDR, and basketball, but I thought one thing that was missing were more classic arcade games.   Overall, Dave and Buster's tries to be everything - a bar, a restaurant and arcade - but it really fails to succeed at any of the three. The local arcade/bars I've been to (in Portland at least) do a far better job on all three fronts."}
{"text":"Dave and Busters is a nice franchise to be able to enjoy arcade games for a more mature crowd. Defiantly enjoy coming here every time my friends and I do.   Cons:  Food - food isn't very tasty, feels \"generic\" and not worth the $ listed for it.  Bathroom - no, I don't go out of my way to down star a place for their bathrooms but this is ridiculous. Toilet paper everywhere, sinks/floor covered in water, and no paper towels?   Pros: Atmosphere - nice place to come grab a drink, watch a sporting event, or meet new people.  Games - who doesn't like game? They have a ton of variety from hoops to racing. Afterwards (if you're lucky) you can redeem tokens at their reward store."}
{"text":"Apparently it's socially unacceptable to continue going to Chuck E. Cheese after you've reached puberty. This I learned the hard way. Fortunately, the geniuses behind Dave & Busters got my back. Sometimes I just need to escape the stress of adulthood with a few rounds of skee-ball (don't judge me). I can work with the amount and variety of games, but it could definitely be better. I would suggest coming in on Wednesdays for half-price games to get more bang for your buck!  Be aware of the obnoxious guests. I expect children to be a bit rowdy, but even some adults suddenly forget all socially acceptable behavior once you throw them in the arcade.   I come to D&B for the games and not the food. Aside from the horrible customer service I've experienced, their food also tastes generic and mediocre.  For the prices they're charging, it is not worth it. Save a few bucks and find a better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and I love D&B but today the upstair sitting area to eat was horrible service. They had like 8 tables free but all dirty and not cleaned up from previous customers. We are sitting here watching no service anywhere. We are still sitting here after 20 mins with no service at all. Talked to bartender twice now to get us a server seems they cant find one either."}
{"text":"So I'm glad I'm not off on seeing the horrible customer service here. Love bringing my son here to play games. But if you are planning on eating in or sitting at bar. Except horrible service. Went one day with family on Valentines day. Yes it was busy. We were walking around playing games w son. Decided to head to bar for couple beers and soda. Stood on one side waiting no service. Walked around found 2 empty seats. Ok now they will see us! Nope. Bartender down the way talking w customers glanced our way. Never came. After about 10 mins walked around to other side again. Stood for about 5 mins. By this time getting highly annoyed. Thing is there were plenty of people standing around that could of helped. Mean while i noticed a girl at a bar top storm off to get her own menu and complaining about the service. Finally manager asks if I need something. I told her she had the worst service behind the bar. And that I've been waiting over 15 mins. She apologized got our drinks. And did not charge us. We are now at our second visit to eat because we received a free entree coupon. Bartenders before even looking at coupon denied it. Then seemed annoyed taking it. Ugh. You think w all the complaints they would retrain in customer service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I absolutely love going to Dave and Buster's!! The only thing is we will only go on Wednesdays. On Wednesdays they offer 50% off all games which is the only way I feel we get a bang for our buck. We've never eaten here due to the rather high food prices any time any day. Even with their offer of a 10dollar game card with your meal usually doesn't seem work it for us. We always like going around 3-4 pm to start our afternoon. They actually have great happy hour prices, 1/2 off any liquar, mixed drinks and shots and then like 1-2 dollars off their draft beers. They actually have a really good variety of games, racing, shooting, interactive and sports games. The also offer what they call a \"power hour\" card for 10 bucks which gives you an hour of free game play for any games that don't accumulate tickets which is awesome if you have your normal play card as well so you and a friend can play tandem games together for an hour before you partake in the other fun games they have to offer. If you're looking for a day date or a place to take the kids that won't break the bank definitely stop by on a Wednesday for alot of fun. The only reason I gave it only 3 stars is only because the high food prices and high game prices any other day."}
{"text":"Great place kids  Had fun. It was a bit overcrowded and the offered unlimited play on certain games for completing a survey The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I think they could use a few extra staff members on a Saturday but otherwise good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is extremely busy!  Their seating is a bit confusing.  They have an area where you seat yourself,  and an actual dining room where you get seated and waited in by the staff.  My friend and I first came in and stood by the counter to see if we could get seated.  There were 4 women behind the counter and not one of them even glanced at us or attempted to notice us for a solid 5 minutes.  We finally decided to look for an open seat in the bar area and hope to get some service.  We were lucky to get some seats at the bar and was helped immediately by the bartender.  My friend had the Porterhouse burger and I, on recommendation from our nice bartender,  got the bacon burger.    The food is a bit pricy and their happy hour isn't really that good.  Their beer is $7 and for happy hour, it's $6.  Not much of a happy hour.  However,  we did enjoy the food and it was made to our liking.   We left the bar area and decided to play some games. It was both of our first time and we each got $25 worth of gameplay.  That  $25 lasted us 2 hours! We had a lot of fun playing the games.  You can keep the card and reload it on your next visit and keep the tickets to add up on it.  Keep in mind that it is very loud inside, between the people talking, the games, the music overhead. I have been home an hour and my ears are still ringing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Our bartender's name was AFTON and she took real good care of us despite the opening day craze. She is a master of her craft. Stays cool in the clutch. Cool like a yeti eating frozen spaghetti. She Took our food order, made our drinks and it was service at its purest form. Anybody reading this needs to ask for AFTON. Spread the word! Peace!  Before... :(  Afton..    :)"}
{"text":"I planned on playing this super cool looking Star Wars game but after being aggressively chased around by a floor associate for my empty Starbucks cup I wasn't into giving this place any of my money. Lucky for me, my erk was compounded by a nasty bathroom that had blood splatter in the sink. Right down the road is Red Rock Casino, so I will be giving them all my future business for Birthday/holiday parties."}
{"text":"Let's just say, I wish I read the reviews before going, my first time to the place ever.... so I'm there with my wife and kid to check out the games and grab a bite on a Saturday night.   They've purchased UFC fight and are charging everyone a minimum to enter -  regardless whether you're watching or not... $10/each  I'm not here for the fight but they tell me not to worry cause we'll give credits to play games at the same value - im thinking that's fine - was gonna play games anyway, why not.  Learned real quick you can use these credits for only maybe 5 of the games offered??  I tried to talk to manager about it - not there for the fight but games and dinner - it's Dave & Busters not Sapphire!  I was told he can't help. Period.  - Can't play games I want with that card - Can't issue refund cause I played one game already - mind you, I didn't even ask for a refund. - Can't apply money to another card that can be used for other games - even if I add another $50 to the \"right\" card.  Why not? What's the difference what games I play - I gave you the cash?    Apparently it's not the minimum to play games, It's COVER for the UFC fight! NOT WATCHING UFC - Who cares! You're paying the cover.  What a SCAM!!!  Super disappointed with manipulation & with the service, especially the ignorance on manager's part.   Would give 0 stars if I could.  Consider driving to Town Square and playing at GameWorks instead.   And No, I am not affiliated with GameWorks."}
{"text":"came here on a thursday night, so not too busy. super far from where i live tho. the games are super fun, especially when you're drunk!! lol i love how the bar has happy hour. waited for a few minutes until the bartender noticed us but we did wait for more than 15 mins for our drinks and to pay for the drinks lmao didn't try any big meals. just ordered dessert-which was good, not too bad. tried their fries- they were good. i only rated it 3 stars bc i wasn't that impressed. i'll go there again for the food and update my review once i do!"}
{"text":"So I go here about once every couple of months.  The service always seems to be sub par. They have shut down half the restaurant the last time we went and were only seating booths. They took our phone number and we sat in the bar and waited.  They never called us  Then unfortunately for our server we sat right next to where the bartender is making drinks so it was very obvious when it took her 10 min to serve the drinks."}
{"text":"Came In today for the first time ever with my son to do the whole Dave and busters experience. The restaurant was packed and they were understaffed. It took probably about seven minutes until a server had finally greeted us. By the time we were greeted we were all ready to order. Our server was stephanie and she was very friendly. However she wasn't very attentive. My son and I each ordered a burger. His was a standard kid burger, and I had the Makers Mark bourbon burger. We were waiting for our food a really long time and my  Seven year old son started to get inpatient and had to go to the restroom. While we're walking to the bathroom we saw our server with five others chatting by the host stand .Unfortunately the restrooms were on the opposite side of the dinning room area, needles to say it was not a convenient trip. By the time we got back our drinks had been cleared up because they had thought we had left. A few minutes later the food runner had dropped our food off. This guy literally didn't say a word, No personality, not very hospitable. I did  ask him to find our server so we can get our drinks back. So When it came to the food The burgers were cold and so were the fries. The buns were not toasted and the cheese was not melted. I sent my burger back to a manager to get it hot. When they came back with my burger it was up to standard as far as tempature. Flavor was descent but I can say I had better.  The server in the beginning forgot to give us napkins and silverware and I had to ask . Overall the dinning experience was a bust. They need better staff and better training. My kid seemed to enjoy it because of the atmosphere.  Needless to say I can't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Brought the kids here for weekend lunch.  Sat in a booth in the Midway area. Service started out quick, and the kids orders went in straight away. Drinks arrived quickly as well. There was a bit of a wait for our adult meals - steaks. I had the chimichurri sirloin, it was correctly cooked to my order but the cut was a bit tough and the salad a bit limp with too much dressing.  Nothing spectacular and no real complaints aside from the very sticky menus, to the point where I felt compelled to wash my hands after touching them. I'm no neat freak but it's gross picking up a menu with one finger because it's stuck to it!  Also, after the standard one check \"everything OK here?\" after our food arrived, the waitress disappeared for a lengthy period. I'd prefer they take notice when plates and drinks are emptied and people leaving the table, as this is usually a clue to come by and see if we need the bill.  But overall, it's sit down service in a noisy arcade and the food quality was as expected."}
{"text":"I had a really positive experience at Dave & Buster's yesterday, as I expected to.  What I did not count on was the A+ drink known as the \"Snow Cone\" from their cocktail menu.  Mmm!  I also sampled the fried shrimp which was incredibly yummy but overpriced at $13.49.  Each cocktail was around $7 which was fair for the quality and alochol content.  Boyfriend had the chicken wings and loved 'em!  We also played $35 worth of games and spent a solid 3 hours gaming.  We also played with the photo booth in the back to find out what our future child would look like!  lol  The photo booth uses 20 gamer points and is WELL worth it!  This was a huge place great for big groups!  Not as many games as I'd like to see, but it's definitely a better deal than a night at Gameworks at Arizona Mills."}
{"text":"I went for weekday happy hour yesterday  which is from  4:30pm to 7:00pm Monday  to  Thursday. Online the menu boasted 1/2 price appetizers, cocktails, draft, etc. I was excited. I got there earlier than the rest of my  party so I decided to  look at the happy hour menu to  see what my  options were specifically, but there wasn't a \"happy hour menu\". I had to  ask the server what  drinks I was able to  order that  would be the half price for happy hour. She basically told me that  it was all of them except the ones with the souvenir cups, Sweet!  I waited a while for my  friends and then wanted to  order food. Again, I would have to  ask. I felt awkward doing this again , so  i just assumed that  it was all of the appetizers except the platters (thats how it  is most places). I ordered buffalo wings and nachos. My  friends get  there and they  ask her to point out which appetizers are the  happy hour ones and to my surprise she only names 3 of the  like 8 or so and none were the ones that  I ordered. Go figure... I only  recall 2 of the 3 happy  hour apps and that  was the quesadilla and the boneless buffalo wings.   The food was good and the drinks during this time were a steal. I paid about $9 for my  two  cocktails. Winning! The food I paid a lot more. My  total  bill for the 2 drinks that  were half off, nachos, and an order of wings was about $35. Ouch and we hadn't even played  games yet lol. Overall I would go  back for happy hour again although probably just for drinks as having only 3 options of a vast food menu wasn't that much of a deal."}
{"text":"The only reason that I'm giving this one star is because I'm not allowed to give zero and because the food wasn't that bad and there was a nice game selection - other than that...it was a horrible experience! We sat in the restaurant to have a nice dinner before we went into the arcade to play games. IT WAS THE SLOWEST SERVICE EVER. We waited 15 minutes before anyone even came to take our drink order. I actually had to get up and get the hostess to get our waiter because no one was coming to take our order, even though many waiters and waitresses walked past and looked at us (including 2 guys I assume were managers). Our very easy drink orders took another 10 minutes to reach our table - though I must say the meal and drinks were actually quite good once they finally came out. Once we went into the arcade we ATTEMPTED to get a drink at the bar. We stood there for 20 minutes - there was one bartender but not too many people at the bar - there were still quite a few empty seats. The lady kept looking over at us, but never came to take our drink order so we walked away. We went back to the bar about an hour later and it was dead. The bartender was not friendly at all - didn't even smile at us. My boyfriend tried to order when she came up to us and then she interrupted him and said she can only do one order at a time (they should fire her if that's the case, because bartenders need to multitask). She was also talking to a waitress right by us and telling her how she felt sick and had DIARRHEA. It was absolutely disgusting especially since she was the one that was making our drinks. My boyfriend ordered a rum and coke and it was just straight rum...no coke at all. I ordered a Stella on draft and it took her ANOTHER TEN MINUTES to bring it to me. She poured my drink and left it there while talking to some people on the other side of the bar. When she finally came back with my drink, she threw them down at us, told us the total, and walked away. This is seriously unacceptable. This place should be shut down, or at least get more workers when it's half priced game night on Wednesday. I've been to quite a few Dave N Busters, but this one was absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"The food here was spectacular! I got a grape chiller and they put gummy worms on the top. They gave my father and I a discount on power chips and we got to play our favorite game till midnight! Of course we got tired and went to our house. It was so much fun!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink before watching the Horrible bosses 2 movie. And was disappointed by the drink prices.   We have a total of 4 drinks which came out to $30 when on a Wednesday we were paying $4.25 each for the same drink.   ONLY COME HERE ON WEDNESDAYS. Half priced games and cheap drinks.."}
{"text":"I heard on the news that they were showing all UFC & boxing fights without charging a cover... First time here.. they are charging $10 cover charge + 2 hour wait for a table for mediocre food.  Im disappointed.  Maybe next time I get in I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Went for a party Tuesday night the food was great and the service was fantastic. Made it early and had a couple drinks, 2 shots for 6 bucks is a great happy hour price for Jager, bloody marys were yummy.  Would definitely go have happy hour again."}
{"text":"I loved their hard cider,  food (Lawnmower salad was amazing) and the games. The games weren't too expensive either."}
{"text":"bar service was absolutely terrible. my boyfriend and I were going to shoot some pool and grab some food around 10.. keep in mind they didn't close till 1 this night. the bar was moderately busy and there were 4 bartenders working. we waiting about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and when the bartender found out we were just ordering two Dr. Peppers.. he poured one, then walked around the bar, POURED SOME GRENADINE IN THE OTHER and handed it to us, as if he was pissed we weren't drinking alcohol. the billiards room was closed for a private party, but it looked like they were finishing up, and there was some other guys in there shooting pool as well. we asked the female bartender if the room was still closed and she said she would ask. after 20 minutes of us sitting at the bar, drinking my Dr. Pepper that had been tampered with, we asked again and she said it was closed. She didn't even leave the bar that entire time to ask anyone. we went to sit down at a table thinking we would get better service than the careless employees at the bar. nope. 15 minutes and the server was too busy cleaning her tables to even tell us they weren't serving anymore. no one helped us. so we got up and left. I wasn't about to pay for a Dr. Pepper that the bartender went out of his way to mess with. As we were leaving, we noticed the billiards room was open, and people were openly shooting pool again. wow. will not be returning here. This place is embarrassing to all Dave and Busters'. Don't even waste your time."}
{"text":"My 11 years old daughter and I went to D&B in Glendale at the Westgate location last weekend, I meant to write this review earlier. Alex was our server, really young kid, but WOW, he has what it takes to be a great server, and D&B should model all their servers after this guy! I didn't have to ask foe anything, he was all over it!!! I've ran restaurants for 22 years and he was outstanding!!! The food recommendation he gave was also the best thing I've had there. Keep it up Alex, we will ask for you everytime we come in."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service that I've ever gotten from a bar. Had a huge get together for a friends going away party, at least 20 people constantly ordering drinks and tipping them properly, yet were ignored until we asked to speak with a manager. We stood there for 15 minute intervals politely waiting for a bartender to serve us with absolutely no luck. This place is terrible and I will never come back."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Food was good enough for me, but Tekken 7 is gone. Cue Pseudo-Midlife Crisis. (It makes sense in context)  The food was nice enough for me given that I am a picky eater. I had a pretty plain Philly Cheesesteak and fries, which was satisfying enough. If you're relying on a food review, check somewhere else. Because I'd like to talk about my latest experiences with the arcade.  I'll start off by saying that I have always been fascinated with arcade games. Fighting Games and Beat em' ups were my favorite and likely still are with fighting games taking a lead. Anyone who's been following this franchise for the last few months knows where I'm going with this.  Tekken 7 is gone. Ever since then, I've been frantically looking for a new hangout spot. This is not helped by the closing of Howie's Game Shack in Mesa.  I have about $40 worth of game chips in a Dave and Buster's Card burning a hole in my wallet. I don't think playing Time Crisis 5 for a 12th time over will be satisfying enough. If the company steps up and introduces more competitive fighters like Pokken Tournament which recently released on July 20th in Arcades in the states, rather than just another dull redemption game, this place will likely win me back.   I'm unfortunately a bit too young to really experience the Arcade Renaissance in Phoenix with places like the Cobra Arcade Bar (Have to be 21, I'm 16) and The Grid. For now, being stuck in arcade limbo is preventing me from rating this once-great place any higher than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Way to expensive. 2 beers and 2 shots $35.00. Did not eat here. VERY LOUD!!! Smells like a McDonald's Play Ground. I would suggest the NY NY arcade instead!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town and we had never been to a Dave and Buster's.  For food we shared  a Triple play appetizer! We weren't super Hungry so that is all we had! The wings were perfect, their cheese curds were really good and my husband ate all the smothered tots, he said they were pretty good!  After that we went and played games! And had a blast! We got a $23 card and both of us played on that card for about an hour!  We won 600 tickets on our cards for prizes so we gave it to some cute kid... made his day!  Great fun for a couple of 45 year old kids like ourselves!"}
{"text":"That food was so good we went back the next day. The 1st day I ordered steak and shrimp on top of scampi was great. Went back the next day and ordered ribs and chicken. Great for the whole family."}
{"text":"Dave and busters was a good time but man, the servers gotta smile and help make the experience a good one. I understand that it's busy but there were servers literally shoulder bumping people to get through the crowd with the meanest faces on. However the bartenders were pretty awesome. Food was awesome. Drinks were awesome. Just gotta work on that service and maybe this would be closer to a five star experience for me."}
{"text":"Ate here and then had some fun playing games and shooting pool.  My meal was pretty bad: a sampler platter with shrimp, chicken and steak on skewers all served over rice pilaf.   Meh.  My friend and I were there on a Wednesday, however, so things weren't all bad (he, by the way ordered the cheesesteak sandwich and it looked pretty good).    On Wednesdays there's a discount on domestic drafts and cocktails (half off on the latter -- how does a large-ish mojito for under 4 bucks strike you?).  Also, games (including pool) are half price!   $6 an hour per table for pool is pretty awesome!  The Billiards room there is actually pretty nice, too.  Clean, level tables and straight cues with no missing tips.  Go for the pool hall...the jury's still out on the food."}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes before a server approached our table to greet us and take a drink order. The food was awful. Ordered the Goldfingers. No flavor and difficult to cut."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! Usually big corporate places lack in service but this location is great from the moment you walk in. Everyone makes you feel welcome from the moment you walK in.  It can get busy but the staff is very courtious.   Tried fried calamari appetizer & it goes really well with two sauces served (honey mustard & tomato sauce...I think).  We came in for a birthday party & everyone was overly satisfied with the service & food. We had Bacon wrapped sirloin medallion, philly cheese steak, bistro steak & shrimp, Bass fish & so much more.  Thanks to the staff & management at Dave & Busters, my staff & family had a marvelous time.  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I made the trip to Dave & Busters aka, D&B on a double date for a little Halloween treat and fun. If you have never been to Dave & Busters think of it as an adult Chuck-E-Cheese. You have your typical arcade games and then you have the ones that really matter. Games such as basketball and skeeball where you try your best to only get a whooping... 4 tickets. =(. But equipped with pool/billiard tables, darts, and a bar you start to forget about the tickets and simply have a great time. I mean, as long as you don't come last in basketball against a group of girls. *clears throat*... rrrrright?  Full Review here: http://brianyee.ca/theburgerblog/?p=160"}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax have some fun and havr a few drinks. The staff here is amazing very helpful and are always willing to give you ideas on new items and drinks. Ask for afton she is amazing.... so is the rest of the bartenders. My wife and I alway have a great time.."}
{"text":"Service is slow and dirty,had to get our own napkins and silverware. Very poor management!!!"}
{"text":"First timer, last time! Went in with my 2 boys 6 and 7. Also had my 7 month old but for this review we will leave her out. Went in sat down to eat first. It was about 12 so lunch time. Fairly empty with plenty of staff. By no means slow but not busy either. We sat in a booth by the bar. We ordered our drinks and took a look at the menu. Ok it was pricey, but hey if it's good who cares. Kid 1 got Mac and cheeses, it was zero special, infant it was straight up kraft out of the box. Which could have been ok but of course it was mass produced back in the kitchen and stored to be reheated when a little freckle walked in an ordered it. Kid 2 who we will for the record will say would eat the gum off the bottom of the table and not complain ordered the chicken fingers. He took a bite and then another and said these are NO GOOD. 2 words I have never heard come from his mouth when eating. Of course I was worried and tried them. He was right NO GOOD. Cooked multiple times or stored under a heat lamp they were dry and rubbery. Like a fried piece  of elastic. I ordered the Mac and cheese and possibly pot roast sandwich. It was beautifully displayed. The meat was well done and dry, not quite as over cooked as the chicken from above but non the less it reminded me of silly putty. I drowned it in good old hienz 57 and got it down. The tater tots? They were Excellent. As a matter of fact we all enjoyed them, including the 7 month old who we didn't include in this post. The wait staff was a whole other situation. Very fake but at least pretended to care. You could tell they were aware a lot of people were unhappy and had zero control over the situation. They ( about 6 or7) hung out by the bar and laughed and joked. I can only think they were laughing at us for being there. The bill for the food 44.00 I left a few bucks for a tip only because I was obligated, I wish I could be one of those people that just walked but I couldn't do it. Again part of me believes it's not there fault anyway. Ok game time. We buy 23.00 worth of tokens. They charge me 2.00 to do so. An initiation I suppose to be a proud owner of a plastic card I have 1000s of from local casinos. I suppose in other states this crap flies as cool in this one at least to me it's more crap laying around I have to deal with it. Anyway. Games were all working. Which is a plus for a place like this. Some were pricey actually most were. But my kids had an hour of fun for 25.00. Not much to complain about in this department. If this was a game room trip I'd give them 2 stars it was not the best I've seen. It was over priced. Too much 1 ball games for tickets. You know the ones that cost the most and last the least amount of time. As if they are giving you good prizes for these tickets. Nope we walked threw just junk. With the 240 or so tickets on the card I left them there instead of wasting my time explaining to my kids that anything worth wolf is 6000 plus tickets. Which you can buy in a store for 10.00 or win here for 1000.00........ maybe. Still I was a kid once and understand the excitement."}
{"text":"Dear Customer Service,   First of all, you should know that I'm typing this with my middle finger...  So when my gal-pal chose Dave & Buster's for tonight's activities, I was a bit hesitant only because I saw the star-rating here on Yelp.  But hey, I've been to the Tempe Marketplace location before and it wasn't bad so I assumed this one would garner the same experience.  Boy was I wrong --- such a low-rating and for good reason!  These Yelpers are on the ball with their reviews!  When Jannette L. and I first walked in, we stood at the \"Eat\" counter for a solid two minutes before anyone came over to seat us.  After being seated, no menus were given so we ended up swiping some off a neighboring table.  I wasn't even mad.  We browsed for a quick minute and suddenly our waiter came by to take our orders, not even realizing where the hell we got our menus.  After telling him we weren't ready, I got a surprise \"gift.\"  In comes Tran D., the missing link to our bestie trio --- SHE'S MOVING BACK!  Lots of hugs, squealing, and chaos ensued.  Anyways, we browsed the menu and orders were placed.  I got the Baked Chicken & Shrimp Alfredo [Originally $18.99 but I did the double-up thing to get the $20 Power Card for $26.99] and Jannette and Tran got the Bistro Steak & Shrimp with Lobster Alfredo [Originally $21.99 but they did the double-up thing to get the $20 Power Card for $29.99].  We ate, service was pretty sparse, but we had a decent meal.  My dish was pretty decent, although pricey, and Jannette and Tran seemingly enjoyed theirs minus the steak being cooked nearly well-done when they ordered it medium rare.  So after tax and tip, we paid about $40 each.  We had leftovers and had asked if they can hold it for us while we played some games.  Little did we know, we'd never see our to-go boxes again...  The night was a blur of games, tickets, and prizes.  Come time to grab our leftovers, the security guard completely ignored us when we inquired about it [hey, you could just tell us to wait for an actual server or staff --- we only asked you because no one was around] and we wandered to the bar to find some staffers but they all ran away since apparently closing time of midnight means they have the right to ignore us.  A gentleman, the ONLY staff member who was nice, named Steve eventually came by and looked at the host stand and the front desk.  He told us the cleaning staff probably already came by and tossed away our leftovers but if we came back, to let them know that Steve wants us three to get $10 play credits each for the mishap.  Le sigh...  I really wanted to eat my pasta!  All in all, with the exception of Steve, it was a night of horrible service --- from bar staff sitting on counters to flirt with girls to our waiter who can't even give us silverware [a different waiter gave us silverware], let alone get us a refill for our drinks.  Little things like that adds up to be quite problematic.  So yah, eff you too, D&B.  I'll be back only because I have like 2,300+ tickets on my card but for food?  Who knows.  They serve a decent meal, a bit pricey for the quality, but the service sucks!"}
{"text":"I've only popped into this Dave & Buster's for booze and games.  I hear they have food...  What can you really say about a Dave & Buster's?  The bar is usually short-handed and packed with people wanting a million cocktails.  They offer a rechargeable token card which is both a blessing and a curse.  After a few drinks, losing track of your tokens is the obvious outcome.  At least you can let out drunken war cries when killing zombies with a fake handgun and no one would think twice.  It's loud in here!  They also check your ID at the door after 9PM or something but unlike Los Angeles, they don't search your purse and have you go through a metal detector.  Yay?"}
{"text":"Man, oh man.  Have I spent too much time here.  Beyond the standard trips for game play, we've done several birthday parties including the pool table room, their dance club Atlas and their Fire & Ice restaurant. I've done corporate parties at the Bowling center.  Basically, we've been all over it.  And I have to say - it's always a good time.    The bowling area is a bit small, but it has a cool feel to it, and the seating areas are nice while you wait for your turn.  The dance club is... well... easy to take over.  It's not the hottest spot in the area so if you walk in with a crowd you can definitely expect to take over the place.  Pleasant bonus that's hard to get in this part of town.  The restaurants are good.  Nothing over the top amazing or anything, but holds it's own against similar places fairly well.  You can choose from Fire & Ice that does \"Bowls\" where you put in all the frozen ingredients and then they cook them all for you on one of those gigantic flat wok's.  Then you've got a basic Applebee's kind of food right around the bar upstairs.  This is popular for us so some of us can eat while others on the same level are playing video games.  The bar downstairs has a nice feeling to it.  Big over-sized booths and a huge wood bar against the wall make it seem like a \"nicer\" spot than the video games upstairs would suggest.  And you can order food while you are there as well.    And the video games themselves are very cool.   Virtual reality games, skee ball, those motorcycle/water-ski games, shooting games, hoops, even some funky pseudo-bowling with these giant screens. Even ones where you can get a prize.  Pretty much something for everyone.    The simple ability to make so many different folks happy, in so many different situations is super awesome.  The fact that it's 18 and over after 10pm - priceless."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my boyfriend and some friends. I have ever been to Dave and Busters and thought it looked fun. The menu was really nice, there was a lot of selections, I wasn't sure what to get. I ended up getting the spicy Thai chicken and noodles, which was really good. Then we went on to play the games, which we all had a blast. They have a lot of selection of games and a $10 playing card actually gets you pretty far game wise. The  confusing part was the way that the servers have to explain the play cards. You have to do it while ordering, and you super charge cards and it really got confusing. Also, the guy who comes around for a \"free\" picture is kind of awkward and was kind of rude. At first he was nice and then brought our 1/2\" by 1\"2 pictures and said he does not get paid and only works on tips. Well we didn't want the tiny picture and none of us had cash, until I realized I did, but it was only $3 and he literally said \" wow that's sad.\" Sorry I don't carry cash, but either way that wasn't even necessary to say, and he stayed there for a minute waiting for one of us to say we had cash, when we didn't. Just an awkward situation. Other than that, it was a really good time, and good date night idea or even place for the kids."}
{"text":"Tuesday's 2$ tacos and 2$ coronas !! Some games are free! So happy Vegas has a Dave and busters !!!"}
{"text":"As much as I like Gameworks, you can't drink and drive at Gameworks! I like the fact you can drink, drink, drink to your hearts content and then play video games with other stupidly drunk adults at Dave and Buster's!  I've been to many D&B's in CA and they were all much larger, had a wider selection of games, and were decorated to a tee. This place doesn't quite live up, however there's always a place in my heart for Dave and Buster's, no matter how small and cheezy because I can drink ALCOHOL while slamming tokens into a game to win lots of tickets. Whee!   They've got a pretty decent happy hour too. The food is blech, wouldn't eat it again and it's expensive too. Everything else makes me happy. I was soooooooooo happy to see a Dave and Buster's finally make it to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Well, don't let my gender fool ya. I love to play video games and romp around like a kid on Ritalin. Yep, it's true. So imagine my sheer delight when my creative work cohorts and myself planned an outing to the newly opened D&B's in Tempe Marketplace. I was so excited, I arrived like 10 minutes early to scope out the place.   Sure, I had been to Jillian's at Desert Ridge. I had fun, but wasn't impressed with their games. That's why I thought D&B's would be, like, so much better. (cue the rolling of the eyes...now!)   Why can't I have my adult playland? Why do I have to be surrounded by crappy arcade games and whirling, twirling stupid sound machines? No, I don't want to actually be 10 again and be amazed by cheap arcade games. I want to be amazed I can go someplace and pretend I'm 10 again. Make sense?  So, my friend and I started at the air hockey table. Uhm, since when did the air hockey puck not float and get stuck in the sides of the board? Talk about a killjoy. After that, we headed over to the fenced in basketball goals. You know, those crazy ones that moves back and forth and shout obnoxious things at you? Yeah, those. Eh, after a couple games, I'm bored. I don't want a moving target. I want a real shoot out competition. That's why I was glad to see real basketball goals, two of 'em, so I could have the shoot out I wanted to badly. That's where you'd find me, if I were to ever go back to D&B's. Forget the air hockey and motorcycle video games. Nevermind the boxing game that's surely rigged (I was totally ducking, a$$hole!). I'm camping out at the basketball game. To me, it's the only one that feels like a grown-up game.   Yeah, the trivia game is fun, but one round is, like, 5 questions. It takes me longer to tie my shoes. Sheesh. Rip off. Let down. Talk about a premature... Ok, so maybe I'm going overboard.   Back to the games. With air hockey, trivia, boxing and both b-ball games played, what was left? I went on a hunt to find the martial arts game, cuz, let's face it, I love that game. I love pretending to kick the livin' $hit out of somebody. Well, I couldn't find it. Talk about the rest of the air deflating from my wanna-be balloon.   So, the real question is this: Did I have fun? Yes, I did. I admit it, but I spent a great portion of my time wandering around, hoping and wishing for more adult games, like virtual reality and the kind you'd find in a \"Must Be This Cool to Play\" arcade. I wanted to throw real punches and kicks. I guess I was hoping for a total fun experience (simulated skydiving anyone?) and expecting more of a wii experience than one that offers me silly games that you can find in any ol' place, like GameWorks. Or worse, the state fair."}
{"text":"Your food service is shit. Waited almost 10 minutes for an acknowledgment, even though at least 5 different servers walked by multiple times. The only reason I was acknowledge was I get up and said \"let's just go somewhere else.\" Then was told by a host who heard me \"it's probably because they're closing this side.\" Well, instead you should apologize and offer to have us move to the side that isn't closed. We left. (Mind you the side that was closing had people sitting there. We also purposely say next to seated tables to make service easier and more convenient.)  (We were going out the door but my friend was really hungry. The only person who helped us and approached us when we came back in was your bus boy Garrett. Not the host or servers... Maybe get rid of some of them and hire more people like Garrett.)"}
{"text":"This is a review for their Salsa nights on Wednesday and Dave and Busters games.    Salsa Nights:  I love their salsa nights.  It begins with a free lesson with a teacher, Brenda Smith, that is hilarious and makes it easy and fun to learn.  This lessons is from 7-8:30 every Wednesday and Sunday night on the roof of Dave and Busters.  You must be 21 to go as there is alcohol up there.  Then after that there is a DJ, and it's salsa all night until I think midnight.  It gets super packed up there as it is a popular event, which makes it real fun, but it gets super hot due to it being outside.  Sometimes they do mists and that helps a little bit.  Brenda also often have dance contests for a dave and busters giftcard and performances by her dance teams.    Dave and Busters:  They have alot of games and I enjoy coming here using a coupon if you sign up on their newsletters.  The coupons are usually buy $20 and get $20.  I like to go on Wednesdays because it's 1/2 off all games!  This place doesn't get over crowded where you have to wait long for games either."}
{"text":"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong.  Oh, how wrong.   Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.   Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.   Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until it's 45 minutes later, you're out of points, you're nowhere near drunk and you've already spent $40.  If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipe's."}
{"text":"Wednesday's are half off game night. Menu includes some meals that also provide ten dollar game cards. It's loud and crazy but that's what is to be expected. The kids love this place. It's ok. Not my thing but I understand the fascination."}
{"text":"Dave & Buster's 1st time visit and we loved it. Birthday celebration for our 7 yr old grandson:) The wait staff was polite and friendly have to put a big shout out to our waiter JACK who did a amazing job with our table of 12 people. Jack was so nice and attentive  with his service we were very impressed with the food as well. We had 3 different appetizers and they all were delicious I have to say the Ancho Caesar lettuce wraps with the chicken and bacon were our family's favorite we had 3 orders of them. All the meals were delicious and everyone enjoyed their food. The kids Loved the Blue Raspberry Sno Glowb & the Decadent Chocolate Fondue was a special treat. Very well staffed and family friendly :) We will definitely be returning . Thank you Dave & Buster's and Jack for making our birthday celebration the best!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Dave and busters I have ever been to. I've been to several locations in many states and I will never return to any. We were in line to buy the game cards and credits and some untrained worker came up to me and basically said you can't have that water throw it away. We weren't even in the gaming area yet. Waiting in the long ass line where they only had one cashier working. I approached a rude manager and said what if customers have dietary restrictions where they need water? I'm 7 months pregnant and it's starting to get hot outside. That manager didn't give two shits. We were going to eat at the restaurant but even the employees working in that area were miserable. No smiles, no thank you, shit they didn't even greet us. We approached the counter and all they said was what's your phone number? That is not the way to run a business. We left and went to eat somewhere else. I definitely wasn't going to give Dave and busters any of my time or money.. if you want horrible customer service this is the place for you. I will never return to Dave and busters. This location ruined it for me. If I could this place would definitely get 0 stars."}
{"text":"me and my family had dinner there this last sunday...place was packed, seating took more than 15 mins.  after we were able to order, it took quite a bit, our waiter was very attentive, asking if were doing ok...the nite would have gone better if our foods weren't so incomplete, my sisters \" THE SOUTH PHILLY BURGER was missing the veggies, and my nephews SHORT RIB & CHEESY MAC STACK didn't arrive, i had to ask the waiter what was going on, to find out that the cooks were supper busy that they are making so many mistakes....and i didn't even finish eating my Bistro Steak & Shrimp with Lobster Alfredo with 3 shrimps!! I honestly wouldn't eat here again...its too over price, and waiting for the waiters to come back to our table to check is too long too. id rather play..well maybe play here twice a month!."}
{"text":"The games were fun, the beer was cold, but the service was a little lacking. We arrived later in the evening and were greeted by...well, no one. We found our way upstairs to our friends' table and sat for a good 30 minutes chatting before we realized...no one was coming to take our order.   Needless to say, I'm still giving D&B's 3 stars because the bartenders we ended up encountering were kind and helpful and the establishment was clean and well kept. Also, I know it's standard for AZ, but I love those misters!   Definitely good for a game night with friends, I just wouldn't recommend going for dinner anytime after 8 or 9.   Neat location though- I liked the Tempe Marketplace, with parking as far as the eye can see!"}
{"text":"I paid  and the waiter never brought the change  back, I never experienced this even my kid said wth, when I asked him where my change is , he asked me if I wanted it ,excuse my French but are you fucking kidding me !"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that I used to come here A LOT when it first opened. I loved everything about this place. What's better than drinking and playing games for prizes? Not much. Then the casinos opened and I found myself frequenting them as my form of entertainment.   We wanted to watch the MMA fight last night and I remembered that D&B shows them. We decided to head up early to grab some dinner and play games before the fights started.   This is the LAST time I'll ever go back. Every aspect of the experience was ridiculous. First, the place was jammed with people. I guarantee they were at, or over capacity. There were a ton of kids running around unsupervised. Way to enforce your \"all minors must be accompanied by adults at all times\" policy. What was most disturbing was observing multiple infants (practically newborns) present in such a chaotic establishment. The clientele definitely has changed. One of my dining companions suggested that we might see a gang fight at some point in the evening.   Our server admitted to us that he had a horrible memory, but he insisted on taking our orders without writing it down. We had to repeat to him several times what we wanted. The beers are way overpriced. Over half of the games were broken with nobody in sight to help out. The other half were dirty and sticky from multiple uses. Oh, and I wish I would have taken a picture of the depleted prize room. It looked like a tornado made its way through. But I thoroughly enjoyed watching people (adults and children) rob it blind amidst the chaos.   What a shame, D&B, for allowing the place to decline in such a manner. I will spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really had a great time here, they have specials throughout the week on food and games and they also have their eat and play combos which are pretty nice, you get game credits and a meal for one price but I still thought that the food was kind of overpriced for what you get and none of it really stood out as amazing to me, next time we go we're planning on just ordering appetizers and drinks and saving our money for more games. The bar selection was pretty decent and they have adult snow cones (score!) I definitely recommend the mango flavored one, you will not be disappointed! Now on to the games, i seriously had so much fun with all the different options that they had, just watch out because you don't win tickets for all of them. Some of prizes weren't really worth all of the tickets that they wanted for them but you really can't expect much from arcade prizes to begin with, overall it was a really fun experience and I'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been there multiple times I have a blast every time. Although the games are great, food could use a little improvement. 4 overall for the average food but great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My drinks came out extremely strong and didn't really resemble the pictures shown in the menu. The games were fun! The prize room looked empty and I was really disappointed in the selections. For a place so big I figured their prize room would have more to it. But the prizes were so so honestly I was more excited as a kid for chuckie cheeses prizes than daves/: still good food though. Spent more than 40$ and it lasted about 25 min. The games are super pricey and for 1600 tickets I got all of 2-3 prizes and I could only get candy"}
{"text":"I love Dave & Busters but this particular location was subpar.  My family and I visited this location on Labor Day around 6ish. There were several empty tables so not too busy. I asked the hostess to be seated and she stated that they were down a few servers and that there would be a wait. I said that's fine and asked to put my name down. She then told me that they weren't taking names and that I needed to come back in 10 minutes...mind you there were several other people behind me. I asked how will I know if a table is ready...she began to explain that the manager told them not to put down any names. What kind of sense does that make! I was so irritated that I had to walk away. Mind you I have no issue with waiting and I totally understand the staffing issue but to tell me to just come back is just plain poor customer service. I was livid!  As I waited for my husband to come in from parking the car to decide what we were going to do a manager came up to assist the hostess with something else and I snagged him and I spoke with him about the seating issue. He immediately found us a table but it was obvious that the server was not pleased. At this point I was ready to leave...I understand that the server was ticked off because of the managers call and I didn't want to deal with bad service. But we were all starving and my kids were excited about being at Dave & Busters. So we ended up being seated.  The server ended being great despite her disposition when were being seated. Our food was good too. My kids enjoyed themselves. Overall the experience was decent except for the beginning."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here - I invariably have a terrible time. The service is awful, the crowd is unsavory, and the food and games are consistently underwhelming.   We waited nearly half an hour to be even noticed by a server, and the food took a long time in coming. Once it arrived, it was disappointing - serving sizes were paltry, and the food was mediocre even by sports bar standards.  The games are perpetually broken, the music and décor are nauseating, and the whole place is a dystopian sensory overload. There are far better ways to spend your Friday evenings... like, anything, really."}
{"text":"I know they just opened but the entire experience was Terrible. It took 20 minutes just to get a beer and then they limit you to only three drinks. This is Las Vegas if you want limit my alcohol consumption then I will take my money next door where I can drink. Then there's the food all the food was cold and had been sitting for a while. I got the Philly cheesesteak burger and they forgot to put any steak it was just onions and peppers. The fries were cold and soggy and at that point I did not want to wait another 30 minutes for food. The arcade part was cool except I thought it was supposed to be orientated to adults. I was there until midnight and there were more kids 16 and under than anyone else running around like crazy. Will probably be my first and last time thete"}
{"text":"Hello, I took my family here for my wife's birthday. It was clean, nice decor, most of the games where working, smell nice and pretty good food too. My family got the three combo meal, my son got the shrimp pasta thing and I got the mac and beef. It was all good. Then some ice cream and brownies for the wife's bday.  After my kids went out to play the arcade games with the meals we bought. Games all worked and where clean.  Would I recommend this place to anyone yes I would. Try something on their menu. It is a big kid type of place and not a regular restaurant."}
{"text":"Well our experience here last night really managed to ruin our week long plans to go there and bowl. The poor service started when I called early in the day to make reservations for a bowling lane. For some reason they don't take reservations, although I am sure many people like myself would happily pay more for the convenience of this service.  However, we continued with our plan to bowl at Dave & Busters.   We arrived with a group of 7 adults.  After enjoying a wonderful meal elsewhere at The Keg.  One, single member of our group had over indulged and I do not dispute that fact. He was that way before meeting up with us, and the other 6 hardworking members of my group should not have been punished for the one out of control individual.   We were told that it would be an hour wait, although there were 5 open, unused lanes. We agreed to wait, and grabbed a table at the bar area. Our drunk friend should have been asked to leave upon arrival, and would have been a favor to the rest of us. However, after serving all 7 of us. Yes, that's right, even the obviously intoxicated person, a manger came over and told us that all 3 of the males in my group were cut off.   Now in between my husband had inquired as to how long we were going to wait seeing how there were 5 lanes not in use. Maybe they just don't like their inefficiencies pointed out. Because shortly thereafter the manger came up and made her announcement to our group.   I had listened to her, and when she left I asked the other ladies in my group if I heard her correctly. I could completely see cutting off this one person, but my husband and other friend were not intoxicated or out of control.   I approached the manager and asked for clarification.  She proceeded to use rather insulting descriptions of my husband and friends and told me they were all swaying around and falling down. Again, I agree with one, but I would love to see what she thinks she saw regarding the others.  I requested a refund on all out drinks as we did not get to finish them.  After a prolonged episode she refunded us about $25 for the 5 drinks on our tab which does not seem adequate since at least 2 of those were premium alcohol. At that point I was tired of talking to the unattractive troll (I hate to name call but based on her description of my husband it seems fair) and took my group elsewhere.   We looked forward to bowling with friends for a week. I regret the invitation to one specific person but I can't take that back. However, I find the treatment of our entire group outrageous and uncalled for. I will NEVER return to another Dave & Busters. I have enjoyed many prior visits but the treatment we received last night terminated any chance of future spending from my family."}
{"text":"Dave and Busters in Summerlin has been a good place for my lady and me.  Once we went in it surprised me how loud the atmosphere was at night.  It was 60.00 for i believe 365 credits to use on the arcade games.  If you are military or a veteran you will save 20% off they just need to see your Cac card or military id or veterans affairs card.  All of the arcades were working perfectly at the time of visit.  The prizes with tickets seems more obtainable than other arcades in town.  It is mostly a 21 year and older and are welcomed to bring your alcoholic drinks while you play.  For sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"I had a team building event for my Ohio team at this D&B. There were 20 of us and we arrived at 12:00 and stayed until 4:00. We had an open room up front with 3 pool tables and a shuffle board table. Our server was great and the manager also kept checking in on us. We ordered from the package menu which included a $20 game card and they give you extra credits. The food and appetizers were really good. I had the balsamic chicken breast and it was huge way to much for lunch. Everyone enjoyed the lunch and the food all came out at the same time and with 20 people that's hard  to pull off. No complaints at all! So hats off to the D&B team for making my event a success."}
{"text":"It is Dave & Busters, if you know the chain.... you know what you are getting- lots of fun games and lots of great bar food choices. We enjoy going here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I always enjoy sitting at the bar cause there is always some sport on tv to enjoy and people watching is always fun. The bartenders are all very friendly and attentive. We typically order a beer and share the bar burgers and wings platter which is more than enough for the two of us. The food is usually pretty good, although sometimes does not come out as hot as you may hope.    Great place to stop in for a super low key cocktail/beer and snack.... ANS always a great place to bring kiddos (if you have them) to get out some energy!  Have fun!"}
{"text":"So I've been here before not this location though. It was pretty empty but we went during the week early evening. Ordered the nachos which were on happy hour and they were not very good... more like chips with a dash of sauce. We also had the all you can eat wings which were pretty good. Our waiter I didn't catch his name a muscular black guy, what a great waiter! He kept on top of our drinks made sure we didn't need anything. My son and I played games which the prices were confusing but it came with the good which was pretty cool. It is a little pricey but I'd go back"}
{"text":"One star...half a star for my first visit and another half for my second (the following day).  We came on the second day of opening only to be excited for the games and happy hour. It was 9pm on a Tuesday, and of course we expected it to be busy. The lines were long to get a power card, but luckily I had one from a California D&B so we skipped the long lines and *tip* went to the self serve kiosks in the back (super fast service since its do it yourself). The D&Bs have a rep for spotty customer service, but you would think they'd try to improve that with their newly trained employees at a brand new location. WRONG!  The bar was crazy packed and it took forever to get drinks (but they're cheap, 50% off all drinks except for the specialty tea) so I guess it's a win-lose situation. Sean was our bartender and he was pretty awesome. 3 drinks = $14. We played some games throughout the night and got seated right away at 11pm. Our server was nice but told us there was no happy hour on food...when clearly there were signs everywhere stating that select appetizers were 50% off. She didn't refill our waters and barely checked up on us. After the mediocre customer service, the only thing that could save the night was crossy road and piano tiles!!!!!!!!  We knew that Wednesday's were half off all games so we decided to come the next night. This time coming with a larger group of people. Apparently at that point (around 8:30pm) the wait time was 2-3 hours to eat, and the bar was horrific. We stood at the front of the bar since 9pm and didn't get drinks ordered until 9:30pm. (That's how crazy packed it was) and didn't actually receive them until 10pm... Losing quality game time. However, it's understandable because we ordered 10+ drinks. It was only about $50. So worth it!!! Alfred was our bartender and he was pretty great. Tough sport, man! At 9:15pm we decided to just put our name down on the list we got quoted 30 minutes for a party of 12. We were shocked but decided okay, that's not 2-3 hours so why not. As the night went on, we enjoyed playing games but were starting to get hungry. Our pager hadn't gone off and by 10:45pm we finally go seated........hosts need to not under quote large parties. Obviously we were expecting to get seated.   Our server checked our IDs and didn't believe some of them because some were still vertical (not everyone renews their IDs). I know it's a protocol, but when you don't check one that's vertical yet you check the other 3............ Anyway, from that point on we ordered more drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our food came out fairly quickly, but our service was lacking. She stated that we \"all looked the same\" (because we're Asian). And just said weird things servers shouldn't say to customers. As attentive as she was, she wasn't really helpful. We ordered the chocolate fondue dessert and the candle wasn't LIT, therefore the dessert was not LIT/chocolate wasn't heated. The appetizers were 3/5 and the last call for drinks just tasted like they just threw a bunch of alcohol in a cup and they were definitely disgusting. We had yet to receive our bill and we were approached and asked to leave by some other guy who wasn't our server. It was midnight. And we had a bunch of beer left in our beer tower and didn't even get our bills yet. If this is how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant, then you're definitely going to lose brownie points.   Overall, I wanted to be excited, and I still am for the future, but if they don't change then the only good thing they have going for them is the plethora of games and happy hour drink prices. I know they've only been open for three days and are working out the kinks, but isn't it the time they're supposed to be at the peak of customer service?   They're lucky they only have one competitor that can't really be compared to them."}
{"text":"By a strange coincidence we were here twice in the last week. Once upstairs in the arcade area and today in the bowling alley. The entertainment factor at this place is great especially if you have kids. It's the service that needs work. The arcade has games that kids and some adults will enjoy and the place itself is relatively clean. We decided to have some appys and noticed that there were 5 tables that had not been cleaned off. I waited while the waitress was cleaning off a table and she told me it would be awhile??!! We found the only other clean table and then noticed that those other tables were not cleaned off for the rest of our stay. The staff are either not happy or not motivated or both. When we did get our food - quesadillas and wings- they were decent. When we went to the bowling alley today they said we had to wait for an open lane- there were 3 open. They said people were coming. We waited 40 minutes and no one showed up for those lanes! Odd that they would pass up the revenue. Won't be back for the pricey bowling ($25/hour) but probably will go again for the arcade."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to for kid's birthday parties. Why, you ask? Because the party itself is DOWNSTAIRS and away from the jangling machines and sugar crazed munchkins. You do the cake, presents, food the kids scramble up the stairs or elevator- and you can either enjoy the semi-quiet of the party area or go upstairs to play and watch the munchkins. Now that mine are older- I am LOVING the option to OPT OUT of the gaming area."}
{"text":"this place is huge, and a bit of joke.  went here for a xmas work party, and its not what i thought at all. when i heard friends rant and rave about this place, it was described as \"the adult playdium\" now ive spent a Great deal of time at playdium as a kid, this was nothing close to anything i've experienced at playdium at all.  i was the first one to arrive at this establishment, and was promptly ID checked at the door, kinda strange, but nothing new for me. i asked if i was to check in with the front desk, which garnered a quote \"check in with security to see if the room is available\" unquote to which was prompted with alot of people talking in walkie talkie's to see if the private room was ready. i was told that even tho it was early i was ok to go to the room and hang out, until the rest of the group arrives. when i walked through the establishment to get to the private room, i thought this place looks way bigger then it looks on the outside, when i got to the private room, i couldn't help but notice the room was in rough shape, chips of paint were off the bottom of the wall, as if someone kicked the wall, the chairs looked visibly damaged(with some being off balance) and i could feel that the room wasn't temperature balanced either. some of the guests arrived and we started to look at the menus, i couldn't help but be amazed that they had so much focus done the alcohol(it had its own full sized menu), specifically the \"coronita's\", the snow cone drinks, and the drinks with the \"berry blocks\" when we all had our drinks ordered, we decided to figure out the controls of the tv, the tv had a box, just in the most awkward spot right under the t.v. to the point where we believed it wasn't a controller for the t.v. at all. i couldn't help but notice the t.v was having a hard time with keeping up if the camera was moving to quick, like cameras normally do with sports games. so we found ourselfs trying to figure out if the t.v was broken to some degree, we also noticed that there was no love with the volume of the t.v connected to the room, where it was either you couldn't hear the t.v at all, or you had it on max and it was a little overbearing. no middle ground what so ever. there was a couple of points in the night where the manager came in to physically turn our t.v down, without explanation, or reason, or even turned it back up after he left. the other thing that i found very odd, was the fact that our room had a door, and everytime we closed it, a worker would open it, or not close it after they left our room. we were sat down at a pool table, with a insert to make the table level, and two layers of protection from drinks and food, but sitting at a pool table is uncomfortable at best, because of the way a pool table is, your thighs are practically touching the bottom of the table, the legs of the table are situated on the ends, which makes for knee bashing great time. the server didn't introduce herself, so i have no idea who she is, but she took forever with all of our drinks and food throughout the night, which made for an UN-enjoyable time. i honestly got lost in awe of the whole establishment, cause finding the bathrooms was a hell of time, and to see the full spectrum of this place is mind boggling. when i went to the bathroom alot of people physically bumped into me, and then shot me a dirty look, i cant help but point out, i am a bigger then normal person but i dont take kindly to acts of aggression, which is what most of these patrons seem to be full of.   the food: the food was edible, and thats about it, nothing special, nothing flavorful, just bland food on a plate, which most of the food ended being cold within about a minute of hitting our table, i found it very odd, that no \"wing\" menu was offered, being a place that serves a huge amount of beer, should have had different flavors of wings, and not just one and done.   the paging system in this place is ridiculous at best as well im not sure why we had to hear every page being made over our t.v. in a private room, that's a little bit daft. as well we were also told that people were being held from coming in because they hit the maximum for the night. also, no minor was allowed to come in unless they had a adult responsible for them, so a 1 adult per kid rule...which i thought was understandable and necessary.   upon leaving this place, a police car was sitting out front of the business, which sealed the deal for me. i wouldn't give this place a dime of my money after this venture. everything sucks about this place."}
{"text":"Ouch.  This one hurt.  I have never been to D & B for lunch or dinner prior to this first off.  We decided to try to enjoy a birthday dinner here and soon realized it was a bad idea.  I'll just list all of this  short and sweet because that is all that matters.   1.  I ordered a beer and it probably took about 15 minutes to get me my drink and it was not  even that busy.  2:  The server was great and was very attentive.  Much thanks to her. 3.  The food was horrible.  The food was gross and overpriced.  My \" hottie\" burger showed up severely under cooked and the bun was sopped in grease.  The rest of the party agreed that their food was either extremely bland or greasy and gross.    If you want to go to an arcade then go to an arcade to play games.  Do not go to an arcade and consider the great idea that a $12 burger might be worth it.  Would not recommend for food and or drink.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Okay , we've been to this fun place MANY times already..but I'm not into 'yelping' before  For an arcade, this place rocks! People of all ages LOVE it here , everyone is having fun as I it's obviously shows in their faces haha It's a cool place to hang out with family and friends. We don't drink, and I like it that way it's safe to drive"}
{"text":"Changed my 2 star to a 1.   Came here tonight for my boyfriends friends birthday. Was kind of dreading it but tried to go in with an open mind.  Half the games literally last 30 seconds. On the guitar hero, DDR and one of the sega racing games which are all meant to be 2 player, it wouldn't let that happen.   We sat at a table to catch our breath for under 5 minutes and i got GUM stuck to my (expensive) jeans.  Finally to top it all off, I just asked for a glass of ice water and I think I would have been better off sticking a straw into a puddle.   Shoot me, also don't come here."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for nieces going away party. The food was horrible. Pretty much cafeteria food but pricey. Not one dish stood out as good. Cold tators, soggy fries, no cocktail sauce with shrimp, no tarter sauce with fish. Meat on hamburgers tasted of the lowest possible quality. The staff was mostly obnoxious. Server started to be nice half way through the meal, but the food runner basically shoved random plates at me and said \"I don't know where they go, I'm just dropping them off\". Almost felt like we were at Dicks last resort.    Wouldn't ever come here for the food. Only two stars for the games. They had a lot and all in good working order.  Over just another game works, nothin special."}
{"text":"WORST HANDLING OF EVENT EVER IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND! If chaos, inefficiency and lack of preparedness had an example it would be this place. NOTHING was mentioned on website about $10 per person cover, NO ONE mentioned about the inappropriate way they allowed people to camp out in a DINING AREA, not tell us upfront and then after 3 hours of waiting finally reveal that basically tables won't be available until AFTER the main event. DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF CORPORATE INEFFICIENCY AT ITS FINEST"}

{"text":"Four-letter-words:  You have been warned...  Shitty bar with shitty bar food. There are tons of video games, but honestly I'd rather play with my Xbox 360. It's a nice idea and people from my generation who grew up with arcades being a normal thing should be thankful they have a place to go that isn't golfland or chucky cheese or peter piper pizza - but seriously, this place is uncool and lame. Nothing hip about it. Granted, I went around 4pm on a weekday...  The games aren't anything special either. And worst of all, when I went the place was packed with kids. Fuck you, take your stupid asshole kids somewhere else so they can get their filthy booger-laiden sticky fingers on games I'm not going to touch. Chucky Cheese is your place, you dick... hell, they serve beer at Peter Piper too - so take em there instead. You're probably the same cunts that take your noisy retard kids to an R rated movie at 10pm.    You know, once when I was like 19 I went to Chucky Cheese with some friends because we thought it would be fun to relive our youth and such and we got thrown out because we didn't have kids with us... they should throw kids out of this fucking place. It's only fair.  The concept of D & B as I understand it is to give adults a place to play games and drink and whatnot. Poorly executed I think. Even the prize shop where you cash in your tickets (super lame idea to incorporate into such a place) had lame prizes.  I dated a girl for awhile who had friends that liked to go to Jillians on occasion. They were fucking dorks and that place was lame... Dave and Busters is lamer. Maybe I'm jaded because I miss the old glory days of arcades and pool halls... plus, I've been to E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) 5 times and that's pretty much like a Dave and Busters that's about 1000 times cooler and that takes up the entire Staples Center in LA.   Just think about all the most sophisticated video games and technology that hasn't been released to the public yet under one giant roof - they give you free shit and let you play games - celebritys show up - hot model girls dressed in slutty video game costumes pretend to like you - famous bands play live sets - the military shows up and shows off new high tech gear - and they usually have a half pipe where famous skaters do a skate demo.   After that, I guess it takes a lot to impress me. Dave and Busters won't cut it. Actually - I would've thought Dave and Busters was lame before I ever went to E3.. probably. Actually, Gameworks in Arizona Mills is cooler even though it's overrun with tweenage gangsters. I'm actually surprised I gave it 2 stars... it deserves 1.5 probably. It sucks... but go ahead and have fun there... don't listen to me."}
{"text":"Zero stars if able. If you like bad service and waiting for an hour for a beer this is your spot. Also when I asked to speak with a manager server said the manager would not see me. I've been a DBs customer for many years but this place gives the company a bad name. Sad. Obviously I'm not the only one. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"I admit I was intensely nervous at coming here after all the reviews. I was coming to see a Mentalist Show and so the venue sort of came along with it. We were in the theatre area, which was quiet and organized, even if the tables were a bit crammed together. Even if it's dinner/table theatre style, they really could have had more walking space. It was a bit hazardous.  The servers were polite, and accommodating. When I was served a pint instead of the smaller size, and I didn't know and was charged, my server corrected my cost to the smaller size since I had not known that I was served the pint size. The food was well plated and tasted good. And I really enjoyed the Mentalist Show.   The only thing I can say is that the theatre area itself is a little outdated in style.  I might have had a very different experience, being there to see a show instead of just eating/drinking/arcade, but for what it's worth, I had a really good time."}
{"text":"Strawberry Hennessy whatever it was, was hella fuego and half off during happy hour. Food was iite but bball and drinks made up for it. A lot smaller than the locations in Cali but whatevs it was cool."}
{"text":"I am highly allergic to onions and anything with seasonings of onions. I went to Dave & Busters to find out that everything including their fries has onion seasoning in them. When I mentioned my allergy to our waitress, Leah, she brought the matter to her manager, Cherry, and cook. Cherry personally suggested that the cook specially cook my food to avoid onion seasonings in my food. I have never had such a great response and service.  Thank you so much for making my night great and allergy-free. I greatly appreciate it!   Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great timing with our order. The salmon was fresh and cooked well. A little too much spice for my friends taste. The lawnmower salad was HUGE just the right veggies. The menu could do with out all the advertising. Over all expierence was filling and fun."}
{"text":"Pretty average experience for a Dave and busters.  I ask the bar tender what kind of beer they have on tap. She responded by and bud light.... and some others I don't know. My wife ordered a mixed drink. Right took 15 minutes. Bar tender took care of other orders before finishing ours. Other than the service at the bar everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, but try not to look at so much the expense but the experience. I came with my husband and we absolutely had a blast. Together we had enough points to get a Finn plush doll. Seriously, the best date I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's a good place to take my young son to kill some time and entertain him - but it's pricey that we will spend $25 on a player card for 150 points and each game ranges from 5-11 points to play.  You get tickets for games that you play depending on how well you do and you can trade your tickets in for a \"prize\".  In the end, for $25, we got 721 tickets which equated to 200 points for a laffy taffy candy and we have saved the rest to save up for \"next time\" to get more tickets so the boy can get a stuffed angry bird (of which we could probably get a cheaper one at a store).  I couldn't justify spending the rest of the tickets on candy costing upwards past 200 tickets."}
{"text":"This review is for a private party and not for restaurant service.  Was invited to a surprise party here on a Saturday night. Arrived about 7:45 to find the parking lot nearly full. Found our way to a small private area in between the game room and restaurant.  A small buffet area and a long table with 20 chairs and a large screen tv playing a variety of music videos occupied the space.  Waitress was attentive to our beverage needs. Food was served buffet style with our choices being mini sliders, chicken tenders and make your own nacho bar. Food was really good and a notch above standard bar / pub fare.  At the beginning of food service all of us were given a game card to play at our leisure. The place was wall to wall people but there were plenty of games and most didn't have a wait and if it did it was mere seconds.  Overall this was a great time! Beverages cold, food hot and tasty, service top notch. I never knew Dave and Buster's offered private rooms for parties. We will definitely keep this in mind for our next get together!"}
{"text":"Awful service and food. Fiancé was served  bacon wrapped shrimp that was very undercooked. Drinks took at least 15 minutes and our appetizer and food was a LONG wait. Asked the server for ketchup and another place setting when we got our food, never came back. I got the chicken and artichoke pasta, chicken was over cooked and chewy. Asked for a manager, he showed up 10 minutes later... Hot mess!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to take your family if you have children. That is the only reason I would go. Food is OK the service is OK. Just don't like the crowded atmosphere.  Have only been here two times and one time at another Dave & Buster's. All seem to be similar  in set up. Lots of games for the children. Good selection of food and drink. Nothing wrong except just to crowded and noise."}
{"text":"My mom has been taking my daughter here for some time.  It is not really my thing, so I never took her there myself.  I went to meet the two of them one day and my daughter was having a blast.    The Power Card is such a cool idea, letting kids save up their tickets toward a larger prize.  Of course, with a four year old the idea is still a hard pill to swallow.  Still, she was able to redeem her tickets for a couple really decent prizes (much better selection than Peter Piper, for sure).  I brought her back the other day since she was cooped up inside when the a/c guys were replacing our a/c.    With a Buy $10, get $10 coupon, I would have received 100 tokens.  They had an add on that gave me an additional 25 tokens for $3.  So for $13 I got 125 tokens.  Normally you get 50 tokens for $10.  The games are not cheap.  Each game she wanted to play was somewhere between 3.7 tokens and 7.9 tokens.  There were also some games that cost more than 10 tokens each.  And not all of the games guaranteed a minimum number of tickets (important when you are saving up for the SECOND unicorn with a blue mane that costs 925 tickets).    After she'd earned enough tickets for the unicorn (thanks to help from me), she just wanted to get out of there.  That was 45 minutes after we'd arrived.  Fine by me!    She told my mom later that she was bored there with me and she only wanted to go with my mom.    This just goes to show you I may be a fun gal, but I am not \"the fun mom.\"  That's okay.  I make up for it in love.  ;)"}
{"text":"I do not like this Dave & Buster's.  Let me start by saying I am a ridiculous, goofy, immature big kid at heart.  I LOVE arcades and the only thing I love more than that is winning tickets to spend in the prize store.  This location makes me mad though.  Just because I act like a kid does not mean I want to be rubbing elbows with your little rugrats.  I know this is a kid friendly place during the day, but for goodness sakes make them behave!  There are screaming rude children all over here!  I was playing one game while being poked and prodded by a 5 year old wielding a balloon sword.  Not cool buddy.  If you want to let your kids run and scream and misbehave, take them to Chuck E Cheese or Peter Piper, but D&B's is not appropriate for that.  I should also point out that a lot of their machines \"forget\" to pay out and a good portion of them will just rip you off in general.  I also hate that I have to go upstairs to go to the main event.  That's not cool at all.  I hate this D&B and I will not go back."}
{"text":"In comparison to the other Dave & Busters, this one is HEAVEN!  There are hardly any children at this one, and the majority of the clientele is my age.  The machines work better here, the selection is better, you don't have to walk upstairs to go play, and you don't get ripped off.  Yay for Tempe D&B!"}
{"text":"Don't ever eat or drink here. Service is atrocious and the food isn't any better. Games are fun good times for a different kind of night out with friends."}
{"text":"The games are plentiful and fun and the food is seriously mediocre.  It's also interesting to see all these apps on my phone showing up as stand up, big screen video games.  Think things like Fruit Ninja and Doodle Jump.    There are plenty of shoot the insurgent zombie mutant horde type of games and lots of \"skill\" games like skee ball where you can pile up tickets to trade in for total crap in the gift store.  Would like to see some more of the classics from back in my youth but, I get it... I'm old!  My youngest son loves the place so it's a great way to take him out, have some fun with him and know that he's happy the whole time."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went there for a pre-grand opening VIP event. I'll start this review with a disclaimer. I KNOW this was a soft opening event and there are bugs (major) to work out. All food and beverages were comped and appropriate tips were left for the servers. Now to the review.... When invited to this invitation only event, I was offered 3 \"seating times\" for me and my 3 guests, 5:30, 6:30, and 7:30. We chose 7:30, assuming we would stay late and play games. No closing times were indicated in any of the promotional materials sent for the event. Upon arrival, the check in process was very quick and well organized. As soon as we went in (7:15) we requested a table for 6 (we met 2 other friends there) and were put on the waiting list. 2 of us sat at the bar while the others went off to play games. The bartenders were excellent, very attentive and were either experienced or very well trained. Kudos to them. It took 45 minutes to be called for our table. Understandable for a busy night. Here's where it fell apart. We placed our order for an appetizer.  and a round of drinks (we all received 2 free drink coupons. When our waitress brought our drinks, we placed our meal orders. 30 minutes later (8:30) there was an announcement that the VIP event would be ending in 30 minutes! Still no dinner.... The waitress apologized for dinner taking so long. Some of us then asked her for our 2nd drink, as they were waiting to use the 2nd drink coupon with dinner. \"Sorry, that announcement was Last Call so the bar is now closed.\" The manager then came over to apologize for the delay in our food and told us we could stay past 9:00 and enjoy our meal. I asked him if we could get our last round of drinks (just draft beer). He also said no, because the bar was closed, but we were brought waters. 15 minutes later, our dinner came, and so did our appetizer. We did ask our waitress earlier to check on our appetizer. I guess either she forgot or it still wasn't ready. A good thing we had the appetizer because they brought the wrong dinner for one of our guests, so he ate some of the boneless wings while waiting for the right dinner. It took another 15-20 minutes for his dinner to come out, as the rest of us had started our dessert. They brought his dinner out in a to-go box instead of on a plate, so he opened his to-go box and ate his dinner. We saved him a few bites of dessert. We were the 2nd to last group to leave. All the employees were lined up at the door clapping for everyone as they left. I actually had the feeling at that point they were clapping because they were happy to see us leave!  Will I be back? Doubt it. I'm at Westgate for every home Coyotes game. Their Happy Hour prices are not competitive with places in Westgate such as Buffalo Wild Wings. The manager's poor accommodations left a bad taste in my mouth. If he would have, at least, offered us a free beer on a return visit (since we couldn't use our last drink coupon), I might have been more likely to try the place again before a Coyotes game."}
{"text":"Went early on a Sunday and had a great time!  We were greeted by a friendly young lady at the front desk who explained how it works to us. She loaded up our card with $29 and the two of us played games for over an hour.  The place looked clean, only one of the shooting games was acting glitchy - everything else worked fine and I got some sweet ball jar glasses and a stuffed animal for my dog with my 1200 tokens.     Nice way to escape the heat for a bit"}
{"text":"This place has lots of choices in entertainment including video games, pool tables as well as dining area when you are hungry. However, this probably isn't an ideal place to go to on a Saturday night. Not only it was crowded, it was so warm and stuffy. I took off my sweater last night and I was still sweating which made it extremely uncomfortable to stay for more than an hour. Few machines ran out of tickets. Parents left their kids running around unattended. It was an absolute Chaos."}
{"text":"Fun place to go to if you are with a group of friends. This is the first time I am here and I totally enjoyed the experience. Worth trying atleast once. I will go back again if I plan for anything with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night for a company dinner. There were about 14 of us. Although I expected a longer than usual wait time since our group was big, our server kept disappearing and it wasnt even a busy Thursday night! Anyway i ordered baked chicken and shrimp with alfredo pasta which was really good but regardless I love alfredo sauce on anything. I was lucky that I enjoyed my food this time because ive been here before and the food is not usually up to par. Its not my review but my coworkers were not impressed with their steak! Quality of food here is not that great overall, its more of an entertainment venue. My meal came with a $10 game card for the arcade, which was good for about 5-6 games. (Ps. Ticket coupons are now electronic, and wednesday nights are half price games meaning instead of 5-6 games you can play 10-12 games on wednesday night only). There were a couple games in the arcade that were out of order or were not working properly which is unfortunate when youre playing with a group of people. There are multiple pool tables as well if youre not into arcade games. Overall, i would not eat here because 1. Quality of food is not great 2. Servers are non-existent. Come here if youre looking for entertainment, not food or service."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all I would never come back here again the bathrooms are disgusting the place is lonely as empty there's one couple plain bowling there is a party upstairs playing games prices are expensive I'm not even going to try the food"}
{"text":"We used to Love Dave and Busters for their games for the kids and their amazing Lawnmower Salad.. Today we came in to have the Salad..and to our surprise they no longer have the Lawnmower Salad.. aSo after searching the menu, all other salads looked terrible so we ordered the sliders to split as we always split a meal.. when they arrived, there were 4 of them and they were a joke.... all 4 of them together weren't a 1/4 lb of meat.. sooo disappointed!!! I would bot recommend eating there!!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy here but for sure you will run through a card quickly so come on a Wednesday if you wanna be able to play more.  All machines were functional and well maintained unlike some locations."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy my time here. It was very expensive! Made it not as much fun as it could have been. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes to get 6 wings, twice, and it wasn't a busy day. Food was disappointing"}
{"text":"What a zoo. Came here a couple times on a date night, but I swear it's gotten worse than the last time I was here. Came on a Saturday night... bratty kids running around like they own the place, security guards literally everywhere, and don't even get me started on the prize room. I'd give my tickets away just to not have to go in there again. As we were leaving, there were two girls getting arrested. What one has to do to get arrested at D&B, I'll never know, but suffice it to say it will be a while until I come here again.... probably until I forget how chaotic the first two trips were."}
{"text":"Went there last night for my birthday with a group of friends and thoroughly enjoyed my time the waiters were prompt and polite the service was great and for a large group they did an amazing job, they made sure everyone had drinks food and a good time, going to be coming back next time we have a big group, thank you Brandon and the other wait staff for making the night memorable with the awesome customer care!! Food was yummy and drinks we are even better lol great place, highly recommend it"}
{"text":"We had very poor customer service In the section by the bowling area. Server did not acknowledge us and when she did, we ask for our drinks and were told \"I'll make it when I have time\". I only came here because of a birthday party.  I will never come back. BAD SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"this place has a really nice bathroom. honestly that is all i remember. i was very very very drunk. i don't even think i meant to go in here. but they let me in after checking my ID. didn't mind i was stumbling all over the place. once i made it to the restroom, i pee'd all over the wall. stumbled back out and wondered where i was. Tempe Marketplace? how the hell did i get here???"}
{"text":"All around awful experience.   Came here for the UFC fights, the place seemed extremely understaffed for a busy night. Our waiter chose not to write down our order and then brought out the wrong food. The appetizer menu advertises \"jumbo wings\" but they were probably the smallest wings I've ever gotten in a restaurant.   This place has dozens of tv's, so we asked our waiter to change one of them to a hockey game; he said sure and then never changed it until we asked him again 30 minutes later.   I ordered the \"BBBurger\" which had burnt tough bacon and the burger patty was identical to one of those frozen pre-packaged patties you buy in the grocery store.   I'm not a complainer, but when you charge this much for crappy food/service I have an issue with that.   This place is a joke."}
