{"text":"Une des meilleures tables de Montréal en ce moment. Le service est excellent et la cuisine nous fait vivre une belle expérience d'art gastronomique. L'accord met et vin est présenté avec passion par le sommelier de la maison. Ça vaut le détour et le retour !"}
{"text":"Nous étions allée au H4C pour la St-Valentin et avions été très impressionné par leurs talents culinaires, leurs service et par l'ambiance. Nous y sommes retournés le 9 septembre dernier et c'était un flop quasi total et pas seulement pour nous. 
L'entrée de foie de volaille a été notre coup de coeur mais ça c'est malheureusement arrêté là. Tout les autres assiettes étaient pas du tout à hauteur en terme de fraîcheur, cuisson, présentation. On dirait que ça dérange moins quand le Prix est raisonnable mais quand tu sort Du resto et que tu viens de payer $475 pour 2 c'est pas juste décevant c'est enrageant. Pas certaine que nous aurons envie de leurs donner une autre chance à ce prix là."}
{"text":"This place made me accept the avocado which I did not like before. The best brunch restaurant I have tried in Montreal."}
{"text":"We went for dinner to celebrate our son's 21st birthday. We're from New York. It was a perfect evening. The food was outstanding. The service was superb. Everyone was attentive, charming and extremely knowledgable about the food. Our favorites included the chicken liver mousse which was beautifully plated and had a purée on the side of a local Quebec berry that our server answered our questions about in detail. The octopus was the best we've ever eaten and octopus is our favorite ! Again, our server described how it was steamed for 3 hours and the first time he ate it he also couldn't believe how silky this made the texture. The sommelier was equally helpful and charming. This all occurs in a beautifully restored building."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.
The ingredients were nothing really special and when our group's mains all came out, they all looked and tasted quite similar to each other. I had the veal sweetbreads, my husband had the quail, one friend in our group of 10 had the scallops and another had the halibut and they all were in the same brown, white and beige colour palette. I could tell a lot of time went into the plating of the dishes, but maybe even too much time because everything on my plate was just lukewarm when it got to me. There was nothing wrong with the food per se, but based on the reviews and the prices, my expectations weren't met.
The ambience and restaurant itself were very nice and the service was good too."}
{"text":"Went here with 2 of my girlfriends and at first we were surprised at how quiet the resto was.  We've all been for brunch and loved it but wasn't sure about dinner. We ended up all ordering the grilled octopus with pea sauce... approved but the waitress. It was delish! And the portion of seafood was generous.  They also threw in some dessert which surprised us. I def recommend this restairant."}
{"text":"This a a lovely restaurant is old St. Henri in what  is quickly becoming a hotbed area for restaurants. Was here for dinner with another couple to try it out and have a nice evening. We sat on the patio, perfect July night. The person who greeted us was super nice and found us a place to sit even when I mixed up the reservation. The service was good, but not what I would call great. 

We started with apps - octopus, heirloom tomato salad and a charcuterie plate - I have to say the apps might have been the stars of the meals - 5 star flavour for all of them. 

Then I had the quail, with morels and lima beans. Lima beans will never interest me, the morels were not as flavourful as I had hope - but the quail was perfect. 2 of our party had the duck - very good, and one had the sweetbreads, which were reportedly very good, but the serving was quite small. Paired with a pinot noir from Alsace - surprisingly good...

3 of us chose the chocolate dessert, unfortunately I was not impressed. There was ice-cream and large chocolate curls in white and milk chocolate - which I wouldn't like at the best of times - but serving chocolate cold defeats the purpose of chocolate imo. There was an interesting version of an aero bar, again cold, not my fav. One person had the cheese plate and was impressed by the selection of quebec cheeses. yum!

So, yes the food was good, very good in some instances, not so great in others. I took a star off because I felt like the food was really overpriced, 1/2 star off for mediocre service, and 1/2 star off for the bland puree de petit pois that was on all the plates.

To sum it up, it was a nice place to eat, and perhaps on par with some of the other local hotspots wrt food quality etc, but I think it was overpriced."}
{"text":"An upscale venue where the take the food very seriously more so than themselves which results in a fun and comfortable experience.  The Octopus, one of their signature dishes really delivered - great texture and flavor.  Veal sweat breads did not disappoint and the tomato with mozzarella ice-cream was a delight.  The waiters all had an opinion on wine pairings and let you try a couple of samples to dial it in.  If you are a Montrealer you probably know about this place and if you are just visiting worth a go for a cool off-the-beaten track, fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Picked H4C out of Fodor's after happy hour food and drinks. That was unfortunate because we were too full to enjoy more of the selections at this truly fantastic restaurant.  The menu items we shared with 4 people were all delicious and creative. It's too bad we didn't find this place earlier in our stay but highly recommend it to fellow tourist and locals alike. Special call outs to all the knowledgeable, friendly, and professional staff that served us.."}
{"text":"This lovely space makes a wonderful first impression: from the location, the outdoor terasse, and the decor, to the warm and efficient wait staff. It's on the pricey side, but well worth the visit. I inhale the bread and brioche but the doughnuts are the thing. I had been tempted to try these gorgeous things from the pictures with reviewers' posts and they are in fact un régal. Soft and sweet-coated with \"cocaine\", they are accompanied by five little white pots filled with orange purée, Nutella, dulce de leche, peach jam and bitter orange. The best by far is the orange purée. Our waitress, Marie-Andrée, explains that the oranges are pressed through a sieve to produce an unctuous, creamy marmalade. My sister and I finish the orange purée and I ask for a second. I should stop eating but I won't and breakfast arrives anyway. The simple white plates are perfect to showcase my sister's vegetarian omelet and my decidedly non-vegetarian veal sweetbreads with ricotta gnudi (think gnocchi but with the cheese). Both are excellent : the sweetbreads are particularly well prepared, with that flaky, crispy, light coating and the melting quality of the sweetbreads as my teeth sink in.

I have that after-food glow: that euphoric sense of satiation and as always a sense of sweet sadness knowing that this meal has ended but that I have mouthed every scent, taste, touch, sight and sound I possibly could."}
{"text":"Amazing service and
good food! Perfect for
date nights! The wine selection is also impressive."}
{"text":"We arrived hungry as my friend and I were looking forward to experiencing Sunday brunch at Le H4C.  We were not disappointed.  As soon as we arrived, they knew my name (even if it was my first time), took our coats and showed us a wonderful table by the window. The mimosas were perfect (not too sweet, not too alcoholic).  For our orders, my friend chose the trout gravlax with poached eggs from the menu and for myself, the waiter suggested the duck confit on muffins with eggs benedict (not on the menu).  When the food arrived, my friend simply swapped one of her gravlax muffins with my confit muffin, and voila! We had the best of both worlds. Although the place was full, we found the service to be relaxed and well-paced, with smiles all around. Definitely looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"The best brunch I have ever had! The best omelet I've ever had, have to try it to believe it. Everything else we got was also delicious - trout gravlax benedict, lobster benedict with wild mushrooms, and the pastry sampler. Excellent service and very nice outside seating."}
{"text":"Awsome spot in st-Henri. 
Right  Next to the métro st Henri.
Wonderful terrasse for sunday morning breakfast-brunch.
Sweet house donuts and brioches With its jams (homemaded too). Excellent ! I am really a fan of jams !

Salty dishes offered for brunches too (15-20$- Worth it, very original )

Inside- restaurant deco is amazing!

Private room downstairs for group or dégustation."}
{"text":"We went to H4C for brunch and it was delicious! All the dishes looked and tasted great (eggs benedict dishes, donuts and brioche, coffee/tea). Presentation was lovely and the service was gracious. The tables are close together, but the room is beautiful and has lots of natural light. There was a bit of an issue with timing of the service (too fast) but otherwise all was excellent. This is a pricey brunch ($18-25 for dishes, which don't include coffee or tea which is $3.50 and up) and mostly worth it, although the donut/brioche seemed slightly overpriced at $13, although delicious. We paid $85 + tip for 2 people. I'll be back for special occasions. Great job H4C!"}
{"text":"An orgasmic Saturday brunch experience!

Let me tell you why! 

Last weekend I was lucky enough to have met another foodie from Instagram who spoke so beautifully of H4C. It was one of the many choices we had to go for brunch. I'm thrilled we mutually decided to meet at H4C.  Which also just happens to be very conviently located of a 30 second walk from St. Henri Metro station. 

Prior to entering the restaurant, I took a few minutes to acknowledge the beauty of the architecture from the outside. Such a beauty! The building was formerly a Canada Post and bank from many years ago. To this day, it remains in outstanding condition and outstanding maintenance as well. Rare to find such a beauty in the St. Henri area. Sadly!

Upon walking into the restaurant, the beauty carried on throughout the entire ambiance. Classy but casually decorated. Great amount of windows(Perfect to take foodie photos!) plenty of space between each table. A stunning looking bar, with a great setup as well. Overall the ambiance is sleek but, modern. 

Since it was in the middle of Winter time, the moment I entered the restaurant there was a kind, and friendly hostess who provided me with a lovely warm welcome. After mentioning I had reservations, she guided me to my table. Right after, she offer to take my coat and hang it for me. Talk about attention to details. I wish more restaurants would do this wonderful and professional service. As many restaurants are lacking attention to service these days, H4C clearly has a strong focus on little details. Most restaurants tend to have dull knives and not the most eye appealing silverware. It makes it for a \"dull\" dinner.. See what I did there? Luckily due to the strong focus to the details that H4C has, their knives, were sharp as can be,  Thank you for that! :) 

Now that my foodie partner in crime has arrived, it's time to investigate our menu. We discussed in details, our waiter soon after offers if we need any help and/or have any questions. The only help I needed was to decide what to order, everything without an exception sounded delectable! Decisions decisions!

We are now ready to order!  My foodie partner had chosen the Eggs Bénédictines, with bacon, wild oh so flavorful mushrooms(Pieds Bleus) little baby squash, on top of an English muffin and a oh so silky, buttery, flavorful Hollandaise sauce. I took a small bite of her dish, and it was just bliss. The combination of each ingredient was a beautiful and harmonious experience inside my mouth. 
I've decided to order the pancakes, topped with tender poached pears along with white chocolate.  Basically there were four(small) very tender, and fluffy but with a slight vanilla/lemon taste to them. Between each pancake there were two slices of poached pears, and a pear gel/like sauce. Alongside of a small pitcher of local maple syrup. 

  Have you ever felt sad that when you were done eating your dish because it tasted that good? I did! This was the dish that gave me that same feeling. I felt sad, yet each pancake left me with a smile from ear to ear. That's a clear sign that everything was done to perfection. Rarely are things perfect in this world, right? However I will say that my dish was perfect! Seriously, they were!

Oh and how can I forget! Since I'm not a coffee drinker and so so of a fan for tea. I'm always on the search for the best made and best quality hot cocoa. H4C did the perfect cup of hot cocoa. Served in a generous size cup, comfortable to hold. At a perfect temperature, the right amount of intensive of dark, but with a hint of sweetness as well.  The chocolate level was perfectly flavorful! The right  amount of foam and a creamy consistency.
 This is where you notice good quality ingredients being used in everything. Even as things as simple as hot cocoa. Ingredients can make it or break it. My guess is that they must have used an excellent quality European chocolate. Callebaut? Valrhona? They do happen to be my favorite two chocolates.  Bravo to the barista of that day, you've impressed me. 

Now that both our friend and I were feeling quite full, and smiling from ear to ear, we decided to stay at the restaurant for a little over an hour to simply \"talk\" The restaurant was packed and clients kept coming in, never did anyone ask us to empty the table or give us that look of \"When are you leaving?\"

To close off this review, I can honestly say that I do not have one single negative thing to say about H4C. Our entire experience was flawless, perfect and yes, orgasmic! 

I will certainly be returning again, and again. 

Thank you to the entire staff for making this an outstanding brunch experience. You have definitely landed a #1 spot on my brunch to go to places.  Bravo et Merci! :)"}
{"text":"Staff are very knowledgeable and carry you through a great food journey. I really respect restaurants that not only give you an amuse bouche but free desserts as well.
You'll find unique and savoury dishes, really enjoyed the mushroom gnocchi, blue marlin, and the beet ice cream."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for brunch is youre tired of regular brunch stuff. The food is fresh and the decor is pretty nice."}
{"text":"Andrea, our server/bartender was more than amazing on our past visit to H4C. She took on the challenge of dealing with 3 guys at the bar who were naïve to the Montreal scene while also touting themselves as food connoisseurs. Regardless, her recommendations did not disappoint.  

Our favorites were the octopus tandoori dish that many on here have raved about, the pork loin with cherry and the strawberry crumble for dessert.  
Also, get the rum cocktail with early grey tea - best drink I've had, literally all year."}
{"text":"Went for brunch during the summer. The early afternoon cocktails were a wonderful start to a
Saturday (suggestion to order a few of them).

Started with the donut brioche sampler plate with different spreads. Everything was homemade and delicious. Order to share, the homemade Nutella and Jams were delicious.

Eggs Benny was yummy. Nice hollandaise that wasn't thick like a lot of breakfast places.

Strongly suggest this place for a nicer refined brunch. Apparently the dinner is very good as
Well."}
{"text":"Bof je n'ai pas vraiment apprécié mon expérience dans ce restaurant ! Avant de dire mais points négatifs, je dois préciser que le service etait très bien et le restaurant est beau! Par contre, je trouve les plats très ordinaires pour le prix ! Nous avons essayé le menu dégustation et nous avons été déçu. Les chefs travaillent avec des aliments de qualité, mais l'agencement des gouts est complètement raté. La note pour ce restaurant aurait pu être plus haute si seulement le prix etait moins haut! 

Selon moi, vous pouvez payer moins dans un autre resto et manger 5X mieux.

Bref je suis content d'avoir testé le restaurant, mais je ne vais pas y retourner!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch since its right by my house. 

I came by myself, sat at the bar, and had an americano and steak tartare. Prices are pretty up there for this neighborhood and the portions aren't enormous, but I did not leave feeling hungry. The food was very good and the people were friendly and courteous. 

As for the quality of everything, it is great. Space is also very nice. This is the second week they are open and you can tell people are already talking about it, since it was half full with well dressed people and their charming, well behaved children. :) In the coming weeks I'm sure it'll totally pack up with lines out the door.

Also, I have to say that, food aside, this place is going to totally revitalize a public square with enormous potential. In the summer there will be seats outside, etc etc, and it will be amazing. Prior to this was pretty much an abandoned looking subway station. 

Conclusion: I am very happy that H4C is open and, while it is not an everyday or perhaps even every week kind of place, it will be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Good food and will return."}
{"text":"Non-touristy, amazing meal. Waiter was very helpful and friendly, décor is nice and food was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"We went as a foursome to this restaurant in early October and were wowed by the gorgeous setting. Would make a fabulous date-night restaurant. 

Service was excellent: neither too much service to interrupt our conversation, nor did we struggle to get our servers' attention. 

A small menu and food was amazing in terms of presentation, and taste. Portions were on the small side but still in the $20-range; a good value. I had the octopus which was decidedly small but in a rich sauce that definitely satisfied. Desserts were also small but packed with flavour. We had the chocolate combination that was enough for two (folks with admittedly smaller appetites) as it was so delectable. 

We definitely look forward to our next visit and have recommended to our friends!"}
{"text":"Booked H4C to celebrate baby's first birthday with a family brunch.  Because we were a big group (12 people) they offered us a set menu with pastries and coffee for the table plus a choice of five different main courses.  The pastries were brioche and donuts, made fresh on site, with five delicious spreads, homemade Nutella, caramel, cherry, strawberry and orange.  All equally tasty.  For my main, I had the trout gravlax, served with poached egg, avocado and a small salad.  Everything was excellent.  Coffee was very good too and the waiter did a good job keeping everyone's cup full.  The service was the best part, warm and attentive and personal.  They even made baby a little dish of scrambled egg which she devoured.  

It's a beautiful restaurant, in an old post office with high ceilings and feels elegant yet informal.  A real neighbourhood gem, thanks for making our family celebration so great!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch!
The beignet with orange jam was amazing!

The duck bacon benedictine was delicious! The vegetables and sauce was a good match with the dish. 

Portion a tad bit small, but enough to satisfy your hunger. More expensive than usual brunch places."}
{"text":"Expensive. Small portions, which is ok with us as I usually overeat. Interesting plating and cooking. But I find it not exactly to my liking, and the fact that it is so pricy makes the overall experience less palatable. Service and presentation is great, but I have a tough time justifying the cost to what my taste buds tell me."}
{"text":"the best word to describe this place is excellence. I only had the brunch with a friend, and our likely simple omelet turned into an explosion of flavours. The donuts with home made jams, the espresso. All out of this world. 

To top it off: best service I've ever seen. This is a place to try and to come back many many times."}
{"text":"Great for foodies, they change their menu often. Nice terrace during the summer, refine inside that will also please you."}
{"text":"Went here with friends. Loved the cocktails and the food. Very friendly service and nice decor."}
{"text":"We visited for brunch and were not disappointed.  The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff very friendly.  The Benedict was prepared perfectly - we had one with duck and one with Guinea hen.  The table bread was outstanding and the drinks also very good.  

The only downside, it was over 85 deg and we wanted something fresh - like a bowl of fruit - but there were no options.  They tried to accommodate us with a bowl of the strawberry and rhubarb used to top the pancakes, which was a nice gesture, but really not the same as fresh fruit.  Our mistake for trying to order something not on the menu."}
{"text":"Dernière semaine de décembre, lendemain d'une première neige tardive. Je pousse les portes du H4C encombrée de mon gros manteau d'hiver, et je cherche mon amie du regard, les yeux encore engourdis par la nuit de festivités que je viens de passer. La première chose que je remarque, c'est le soleil qui surplombe chaque recoin de la salle à manger. Je souris à la vue du décor épuré et de la belle machine à espresso, jusqu'à ce qu'une jeune femme vienne me proposer d'aller déposer mon manteau plus loin, proche de la cuisine ouverte. Un début tout en douceur, qui ne fait qu'intensifier mes attentes face aux délicates assiettes de leur menu dont j'ai tant entendu parlé.

Le H4C ouvre ses portes durant l'été de 2013. L'année suivante, il se classe parmi les meilleurs 30 nouveaux restaurants canadiens. Il va donc sans dire qu'ils ont attiré mon attention depuis un petit moment; ne restait juste qu'à trouver la bonne occasion pour leur rendre visite! C'est donc pour souligner mes retrouvailles avec une amie que je n'avais pas vu depuis quelques mois que je m'installe, impatiente de découvrir la magie qui se passe dans leur cuisine.

Mais n'oublions pas les priorités; avant tout, il me faut du café. Fidèle à leur quartier, le serveur me propose les grains chocolatés du Saint-Henri, servis dans les règles de l'art. Et justement, parlons du service: Les verres d'eau sont constamment remplis, nos questions soigneusement répondues, et les plats arrivent sans que l'on ait l'impression d'avoir attendu. L'omelette est imposante, mais d'une texture aérienne comme un nuage, et sous sa couverture se cache un heureux mariage de fromage, de courge et de kale. Les bénédictines sont coiffés d'une épaisse tranche de lard salé, et baignent dans une hollandaise qui nous chante la sérénade avec ses doux arômes de beurre. Chaque bouché est suivie d'un tendre sourire, du pain maison marqué au grill servi en entrée jusqu'à la dernière pleurote de mon assiette. 

Ils avaient mon attention, maintenant ils détiennent mon amour. Le H4C réussit à marier gastronomie et simplicité d'une majestueuse main de maître, et il ne me tarde d'y retourner pour essayer leur service du souper, histoire de me réchauffer au coeur de cet hiver qui ne fait que commencer."}
{"text":"Bon brunch avec ambiance assez fancy. Personnellement je préfère les bruncher vraiment copieux. J'ai pris les oeufs pochés au saumon et épinards et c'était très bon. Service à l'écoute."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a recent trip to Montreal. Despite all of my trip planning, he found this one on a whim. Boy, were we thrilled! This may have been the best food we ate all trip (and there were plenty of fabulous options). I went with any of the vegetarian options available (peppers, cippolini appetizer and the gnudi) and he had the octopus for his main. We both were floored by the service, attention to detail, and quality of the food. I wish we could go back!"}
{"text":"ll y a restaurant et restaurant!! Certains sont des endroits avec la vocation de vous faire à manger, d'autre et c'est la réputation du H4C, est de vous faire vivre une expérience gastronomique. 

Déjà le lieu porte une réputation: \" adresse mondaine \", \" restaurant de luxe \", \" repaire huppé \"! Nous avons le réflexe de classement rapide en 2018.  Rien n'est plus facile que d'écrire une critique culinaire sur un resto montréalais, dans les médias et les réseaux sociaux un ouragan d'inepties déferle chaque week-end sur ce sujet. Bref le but de celle-ci n'est pas de lyncher quelques cuistots que se soit et encore moins de jouer à l'aboyeur public, mais uniquement de partager une expérience. 

L'aventure débute par l'élégance de la superbe bâtisse du tout début du XXe siècle et du décor - un ancien bureau de poste rénové selon les règles de l'architecture contemporaine. L'accueil par le personnel, une fois à l'intérieur ressemblait étrangement à la température extérieure, sombre et froide! Une fois reconduit à notre table, et accueillit correctement par notre maître d'hôte et la serveuse, nous avons fait une belle découvert avec un Crémant d'Alsace 100% chardonnay produit dans le Jura, un Crémant exceptionnel. Avec sa mousse généreuse, son nez volage, sa robe limpide et sa bouche vivace, ce vin offre toute la finesse d'un champagne en dentelle, délicieusement rafraîchissant, rond, délicat et gracieux. Une très jolie assiette d'huître généreuse accompagnait les petites bulles. Un véritable trésor de nacre et d'iode que renferment ces jolis coquillages.  Nous avons enchaîné Un Hiramasa avec choux marinés, beurre d'huître congelé et raifort. Suivi de l'omble chevalier servi avec légumes finement tranchés accompagné d'une sauce mousseline parfumée à l'oseille. Nous avons terminé par le plat signature du resto, c.-à-d., la pieuvre poêlée style tandoori avec sauce au yaourt caramélisé et noix de cajou légèrement épicé servi dans un oignon rouge et un riz basmati. 

Le seul point faible du repas fut l'interaction avec le sommelier qui était aussi démonstratif qu'un douanier nord-coréen et qui semblait aussi passionné par son art qu'un globule rouge sous-alimenté.

Bref, l'expérience gastronomique eut bel et bien lieu, mais pour ce qui est de l'ambiance chaleureuse et du contact bienveillant du personnel on repassera! La soirée fut intéressante, mais sans plus!"}
{"text":"Delicious and beautifully executed food. The service, albeit slow, was friendly and professional.  Nice decor in a beautiful old building, and the neighborhood is up and coming."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas office party here so my opinion might change on another circumstance. Everything was original and tasty, nothing to complain here, except maybe for the desert. I love desert and I'm opened to trying new things, but peas and white chocolate didn't do it for me. It rolled in my mouth and I couldn't finish it, it was just not up my alley. Can't say anything about the prices but the service was good, we had our private room and a waiter to ourselves. Good experience overall, I'd like to try brunch next time !"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  The food was surprising, artistic, and delicious.  And the service was the best I've ever had in any restaurant, period.  Every server could describe each dish in detail and they were extremely friendly and accommodating.  They even chained our BIXI bikes up for us.  I can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Last night I had the best meal of the year. The food is exquisite with flavours bursting in your mouth. I recommend this restaurant to foodies. The decor is a combination of contemporary and original   Stunning high ceilings and modern lighting combined with art and brick and stone. The duck was most memorable!!!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas du tout aimé. Nous avons pris le menu dégustation (le plus petit) et les plats manquaient de finition! On aurait dit qu'ils voulaient à tout prix faire quelque chose de surprenant, que tu finissais surpris par les goûts qui s'agençaient mal plutôt que conquis par le plat. Certes les aliments sont de qualités, mais on ne sait pas quoi faire avec! 

Je suis d'autant plus déçue par le prix exorbitant pour la qualité du repas. Selon moi, il y a mille restaurants à essayer avant celui-ci. Rien à voir avec les accords parfaits du Toqué ou encore du Bouillon Bilk.

À éviter."}
{"text":"Le H4C is obviously a labor of love. 

The quality of the food ingredients are fantastic and the kitchen does brilliant, gorgeous work with them.  The front of the house is friendly, engaged, and super knowledgable. 

I had a truly wonderful meal here and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had the Sunday brunch..
I am not going to say much different from the other reviews, ie:
friendly, the food well executed and tasty, the servers knowledgable and pricey. We were there in late Sept and it seems like they are open for dinner only? Brunch on Sundays only, which was too bad because I really wanted to have those eggs benedict again!"}
{"text":"We had big expectations for H4C... But seriously, except the place itself, nothing was good. Food was average, wannabe gastro type food, but some defect are there,: my octopus was cook correctly, but it was so salty! My girlfriend dish was tasting nothing exceptional. 

Worst thing is the service. You pay 100$ for a bottle of wine , you expect somebody to pour it for you. But we had to pour it all night! 

If you have this budget go to Chez Sophie or even pay a little extra for Maison Boulud or Joe Beef :)"}
{"text":"We went here during the mtlatable event so my review may be biased as we were able to enjoy what this restaurant had to offer but at a reduced fare. 

Nonetheless, for what we got for the price we paid, this was definitely a 5 star dining experience. 
The decor is elegant yet rustic and welcoming as it is set in a old revamped Montréal heritage building.
The service was on point with the presence of an amicable in house sommelier and attentionate waiters. 

Food was beautifully presented and every bite was deliciously well thought out. 
We had the marinated hamachi and the gnuddis for appetizers. Both were so flavourful, especially the gnuddis as the basked in an earthy mushroom broth. 
For mains, we were served oh so tender octopus tandoori as well as even more tender pork cheeks. Melt in your mouth goodness!

Deserts were also a highlight as each item  was served with a sorbet AND an ice cream! Millefeuille with apple sorbet and caramel ice cream? How about toasted marshmallow with cranberry sorbet and smoked chocolate ice cream? More of both please! 

My only complaint about the meal as a whole would be portion size. More of everything please! 
But given the 41$ price tag to our three course menu, we can't complain too much. Now I don't know if I would have been this satisfied with their regularly priced menu but if they had this all the time, then I'd be a regular! If you get the chance to try it out during next year's mtlatable or if money is no concern then go! You'll be more than happy!"}
{"text":"Original dishes, good and pleasant service, great choice of ambient music. There is something missing, though...I had the ricotta gnudi as a main and wasn't thrilled. I enjoyed the wine selection. My boyfriend had the duck and it was exquisite. I might give them a try for brunch one of these days."}
{"text":"Tried this place out again for brunch because our usual place was closed for holiday vacation still. 
We were hoping it would be a better experience then last time. 

We should of left before we even sat down. 
Super unfriendly welcome, scowled at us when we said we didn't have a reservation; it was 1 on a Saturday  and the restaurant had more then half, the empty tables, and possibly two tables came in after us.

We ordered the yogurt, apple chocolate pancakes, that had great reviews online. The yogurt is actually white chocolate yogurt. The apples are kind of like the ones you get in an Apple pie but a tad harder and much more sour. For 20$, they weren't worth it., there are three and they are tiny.  The white chocolate really throws off the taste in my mind. 

While we waited for our food they dropped off burnt toast... 

Our waiter Dan would walk by us pick up one of two empty mimosa glasses and not ask us if we'd like another. We ordered from the bar numerous times. He was kind enough to offer us our latte's for free because we seemed to not like our pancakes. (Points for noticing.. but why didn't you ask?)

We racked up 150$ at this restaurant for brunch and he wasn't attentive AT ALL. Didn't check up on us again. 

Won't be returning again."}
{"text":"I couldn't have dreamt up a nicer experience. The service was impeccable and the setting in this historical building was perfect! It had a great ambiance, and each staff member we interacted with was as excited as were about he 9 course tasting menu. Bonus points for ensuring each course was gluten free!"}
{"text":"I am the first happy camper to post a dinner review. Good news!! I think this will most likely become a nice restaurant to think of when in the neighborhood.

I was there two weeks ago for a saturday dinner with my girlfriends. The set up is very cute ; fresh, cozy, classy yet not too fancy. The waiters are very kind and professional. I give service a straight 10 !!

I must say, the lighting was a bit bright for a saturday evening dinner. I mean, the fact that we noticed how shiny and bright the room was means it probably could have been a bit smoother  - how about cute candles ?

OK - let the fun part begin. FOOD (and drinks!) 

First off, awesome wines, starting at around 45-50$ per bottle, but fun stuff to enjoy and discover.

As per the food itself, all plates are pretty much appetizer sized meaning you get to try a few without feeling too full afterwards. Too bad I didn't take any pictures -  the presentations are pretty nice.

I had the foie gras dumplings with lobster mushrooms and an asian broth. The broth was a tad too salty, but hey, whenever there's fois gras and mushroom, there's me happy. So that was yummy !!  My friends tried the octopus and enjoyed it very much as well.

I followed with sweetbreads which were very good. Not that big as a plate as I mentioned earlier, yet very tasty. Plus, I had some extra room for cheese! 


The best  part was the cheese part. The waiter presented me with the selection and I chose three different kinds to try. The highlights of this course, however, were all sides : O-M-G. The waiter served me honey directly from what seemed to be a piece of hive (?). That was sticky, melty and delicious ! The cheese platter also came with an amazing jelly and a fruit compote. Yum-my. My friends had deserts which seemed funky and interesting - one of them had a black sesame cake which was weird but good !! However, I was enjoying my cheese was too much to even pay attention to what was going on around me. 

All in all, it was a really good night. I would really like to try the brunch, although I will probably wait for a special occasion  - it's a bit pricey I must admit. However, it's definitely worth the try. You should go !! :)"}
{"text":"I am a foodie from Chicago. The veal sweetbread egg with hollandaise on an English muffin was probably in the top 10 of best meals of my life. Savory buy sweet and creamy. This meal set the standard for Montreal eating. Kudos to Le H4C!"}
{"text":"Went twice and was amazed both times.  The staff was extremely attentive and unpretentious.  The place is laid back but has enough decorum at the same time.

Food-wise I've always been a fan.  Scallops done to perfection, also had a vegetarian plate with smoked kale  that was to die for.  The quality of the ingredients and the work put into each plate is noticeable.  Nothing feels misplaced, savours are in harmony.  We were also well advised for the wines, sommelier kept us within a decent price range.

The place is well located in a trendy spot in the city.  I will definitely go back!

One thing we did notice the second time around was the spacing between tables got a little closer.  Don't know if they're reconfiguring but it was perhaps the only low-point."}
{"text":"Recommended by our hotel and fellow yelpers this is an excellent brunch choice. Incredibly easy to get to since it's right next to the St Henri metro station. We had an early brunch reservation so we were the first ones seated for the day, but later in the day reservations would likely be helpful since the place started to fill pretty quickly closer to noon. 

Food - Definite winners are their homemade jams and donuts. Their spinach omelet was impossibly light, fluffy, and surprisingly filling. The eggs benedict were great as well - crispy bacon, sautéed spinach, and hollandaise sauce. My one negative remark would be one of my eggs was beyond poached so it wasn't as runny as its twin. 

Service - Attentive and warm. Never had to wait for our drinks to be refilled. 

Decor - The building is beautiful and the interior is a nice mix of warm and modern."}
{"text":"Très belle soirée au H4C. On s'est régalé autant avec les entrées, les plats principaux et les desserts. Et tout ça dans une très belle ambiance. Content que les proprios aient misé sur St-Henri. J'y retournerai."}
{"text":"For my final review of 2016, we have my final MTL à Table choice from November. For about 3 years now, I had heard great things about a restaurant located in the heart of St-Henri. Living near McGill, I thought about it but never went. Last year, moving to Pointe-St-Charles meant I could walk there now if I wanted to... but I still didn't visit. Finally, the opportunity came around so I found myself at le H4C ready to see if the wait was worth it.

Started by the founders of an architectural firm and chef Dany Bolduc, le H4C has the stated goal of combining responsible and sustainable architecture to gastronomy. The restaurant is located within a 1893 vintage building that used to be a post office. It has been restored beautifully - showcasing the old features of the brownstone while adding some more modern touches. The space is completely open and beautiful - the use of wood tables and leather banquette and chairs complement well the gorgeous stone exterior walls. The overall vibe is very calm and intimate - a perfect date night location.

The menu is an interesting mix. I supposed one could call market cuisine with emphasis on local ingredients using french technique. It lents itself to very particular dishes. First up was housemade duck pancetta with papadoum, lime, curry, mustard, tamarin and cilantro. The pancetta was wonderful - the fatty taste of duck very strong and the texture wonderfully tender. The papadoum (a sort of Indian fried tortilla) provided a nice crunch to pair with the duck. The sauces dotted along the papadoum provided different accents flavours to play with. An excellent dish. 

Our second starter was equally well executed. The marinated salmon with cauliflower, creme fraiche, salmon roe and spices was similar to the first in that the primary ingredient was done simply but so well. The fish had great freshness and a lovely texture to it. The use of cauliflower and creme fraiche, while weird together in theory, worked very well with the salmon to enhance it by bringing in some richness.

The final entree we tried was the Ricotta gnudi with gruyere, onion and croutons. Essentially a french onion soup broken down with gnudi instead of that big cheesy bread. A very cool usage of a classic French recipe and have some fun with it. Excellent onion broth - rich and smooth. The gundi were soft and lovely balls of rich ricotta. Adding the gruyere on top just made it richer and more filling.

Our mains continued the high level of execution. First was the octopus with tandoori, caramelized yogourt, red onion, basmati rice and coconut. The octopus was wonderfully tender and the tandoori spices brought some nice flavour. The combination of the red onion and the yogourt provided some nice sweetness and creaminess to pair with the octopus.

My dish of the night was the main I ordered: smoked meat with potatoes, smoked onions, rye, mustard and marinated cabbage. A wonderfully weird deconstructed smoked meat sandwich that tasted as close to the real thing as possible without having just meat between rye bread. The smoked meat was perfect - getting that right level of tenderness and flavour. I was just missing my root beer (or cherry coke if that's more your thing)!

The desserts had a hard time matching the highs of the mains. First the lemon meringue with cucumber ice cream and gin was interesting texturally but the cucumber popped more than the lemon or even the gin which didn't work for me. The squash with gingerbread, white chocolate and pumpkin seeds was an interesting savoury sweet idea that worked better in theory than practice. No one at the table really enjoyed the preparation of the squash - almost gelatinous but the flavour didn't work at all. The gingerbread and white chocolate mousse were excellent but that wasn't really the point.. We also got some housemade popcorn which was very good as well.

Le H4C was a solid night out. A very high level of execution throughout the meal in a beautiful environment. With the exception of the desserts, the meal was enjoyable by everyone at the table. I'm happy to see a restaurant such as this one succeeded in my part of town and I'm sorry it took this long to come visit. They also do brunch so I will need to check that out as well. Le H4C deserves your attention if you are visiting the Sud Ouest.

Cheers!"}

Impeccable , une vraie aventure culinaire. Très bon cocktails , nourriture exceptionnelle , sommelier . Oh et l'architecture du lieu est très chouette.

Bijou dans St Henri ."}
{"text":"If you live in Saint Henri, this restaurant is quite unique In terms of its environment. Not that many spots have nice big terrace or high ceiling stone building with comfortable seatings. The brunch is  well-presented and classic. It's about $3-5 more expensive than average brunch place but quite fair for the environment you get. We actually stayed for a really long time chatting with friends because it's just that pleasant to sit there, also because it took 3 servers, 30 minutes to get our bill. The menu is kind of lacking of a personal touch, but the donuts seem to be their specialty, it's good but too filling to have after your brunch plates. May go back if I'm in the neighbourhood and in need of a nice place to carry nice conversations with friends."}
{"text":"Je trouve qualité prix decevant, en partant le pain et beurre est chargé 3,50$ et servi froid en plus !! Ils pourraient se forcer pour acoter leur tarif ... par contre le service est tres attentionné."}
{"text":"On the quest for more raw meat and/or seafood, today we brunches at H4C.  Brunch was gravlax swordfish with 2 poached eggs and creamy avocado on a toasted muffin.  Highly recommend.  Husband really enjoyed the eggs benedict with thick cut lamb bacon.  Started with an order of beignets with orange dipping sauce.  Not good if watching sugar intake, but really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of mixed things about H4C from my culinary colleagues so I procrastinated making a visit. I wish I had gotten over the grape vine sooner and made this visit- brunch was wonderful this morning.

Calling in advance by only 45 minutes, we were still able to get seats at the bar and the chef graciously accommodated a vegan plate for my partner. They conjured up a beautiful mushroom and artichoke tartine with shaved raw almonds on top (resembling pecorino). Needless to say it was a hit. I ordered the swordfish gravlax benedict and was also really impressed. The avocado sauce had the perfect tanginess to match the fish, which was a beautiful grape colour. The grilled breads that accompanied it all were also great. Coffee and mimosas as well, were very on point.

The space I think is a little boring considering it's in a beautiful heritage building (an old bank perhaps?) but maybe that's only because it stands in the shadow of the food and exceptional service.

All in all, while definitely on the pricier range for brunch, was still very worth it."}
