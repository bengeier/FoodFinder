{"text":"Grate & Barrel catered an office lunch for us. I loaded my plate with a half sandwich with pork and kimchi, a half with maple ham, and a cup of tomato soup.  The sandwiches were tasty, if a bit heavy and greasy. However, the soup... Well, I tried a few spoonfuls, and did not love the strong thyme/herbal flavour. That would not have been so bad, except my next spoonful had a chunk of plastic from a lid (the soup was served in coffee cups). Ok, mistakes happen, but the following spoonful lifted up a disc of cardboard. I looked around me and most of my co-workers were lifting a disc of cardboard out of their own soup.  The thought of returning turns my stomach.  Also, the name is stupid. I guess it works in the sense that it's unforgettable and gives people something to talk about, but I hate saying \"Grate and Barrel\" and hearing the predictable response of \"Do you mean Crate and Barrel, like the furniture store?\" Even Google suggests the furniture store."}
{"text":"So I was wrong about a couple things. Received a polite note from the fiancé of the proprietor.   The bread is rye bread from Engls and the cheese is hand sliced block cheese by the sounds of it. Also the meats aren't from a bag but are a home recipe.   So my bad on that. I might have been thrown off by seeing packaged tater tots and pepper poppers and assumed that applied to everything.   I also appreciate that this is a new venture and the girls are learning. I get that. So I have temporarily raised my rating until I try it again.   Still... the things I believe they will run into is speed of service, and relative price.  They got to get a proper deep fryer and and additional hit press. There are some deadly grilled cheese in the area at other shops that are amazing (like the sidewalk citizen product) and to compete you gotta get good fast. When it comes to people's bellies (and wallet) you get only one chance usually.   Anyway... if you liked grilled cheese... maybe give it a shot. I hope they sort it out and succeed. It's a great idea."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I was sad to see that we were the only folks in there (but it was only 11:30 am, so you know), because this place is a great addition to Mission! We wandered in and the staff was friendly, funny and polite, which is always a good sign. We both got cherry pie milkshakes. They were pretty epic. There is pie blended into the smoothies so we got chunks of pie crust and cherries in our milkshakes. Very decadent, very tasty. My fella got a ham and gouda grilled cheese that he loved, and I got the Forbidden Dimension, which is a grilled cheese with provolone, marinara sauce, mozzarella sticks inside it and a parmesan crust. It was pretty epic. It was also HUGE. I could only eat half of it, but it was so gooey and yummy. They serve their grilled cheese with fantastic ketchup on the side. SO so good.   I agree with John M. - it is very much like if Tubby Dog served grilled cheese. Really relaxed vibes, super decadent food, and great staff."}
{"text":"Awesome grilled cheese we had the wisers with wine and FANTASTIC tomato soup and a Tim Williams with hickory sticks and a blueberry pie milkshake. Cucumber water yes. Swoooon.   We wish there were pickles and regular ketchup and the presentation of the milkshake could be better, otherwise you guys rock our world.  I see cinnamon toast crunch and I look forward to consuming a milkshake of that nature.   The lady taking our order is so nice and best grilled cheese we've ever had omg"}
{"text":"Great little place. Food is really good. Love the pie shakes!  Will for sure go back again."}
{"text":"The Chef Who Fed Me: So there I was waiting in the chilly cold night by the bus stop on 24th SW when this tall guy approached me with a tray full of bite-size sandwiches and asked me if I wanted to try some grilled cheese with kimchi, beef and a whole bunch of other stuff that sounded just decadently gourmet and I thought, REALLY FUNNY...except the dude, Angus, is the executive chef of Mission Diner (renamed Grate and Barrel). So I took a bite, and another and WOWZA! It tasted awesome! Amazing uber delicious grilled yummy tasty cheese sandwiches! When I get back from Chicago next week, I am definitely grabbing a sandwich there to go! On the other hand, if I expire tonight due to some strange food, here is the mug shot for the numero uno suspect. I don't think I will though, in fact I REALLY hope I won't! Because, I think from the taste of those sandwiches, Chef Angus just got a new customer"}
{"text":"Horrible place! Same owners just changed business name as the reviews showed how badly the business was doing.   The promotional photos show burnt grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Just had my first Grate and Barrel experience. It REALLY was good. I had the MBF. A grilled cheese sandwich with jalapeño peppers. Made me happy. And a pint from a local brewery. Also made me happy. I felt like a grownup and a kid at the same time. Was awesome. Worth checking out, in my humble opinion. Gourmet grilled cheese and beer. Life is good."}
{"text":"If you like presidents choice cheese and Dempster bread, this place is for you. If your expecting a well crafted grilled cheese to the caliber of other places in the neighbourhood you will be disappointed. Lastly the service was rather distracted and rude."}
{"text":"Came here for some comfort food with a good friend. I didn't really know what to expect, but went in with an open mind and the dream of cheese.   Inside is very tiny, it's more like a grab and go location then a sit and chat. Since we came here to catch up, we decided to stay but to be honest I didn't like the space and I found it uncomfortable.  Now for the cheeeeese. My friend and I both originally ordered our two different grilled cheese but they were out of the ingredients to make both of our first choices, so we settled on different sammies and I got a side of bugles (because, um bugles?)  I was not mesmerized at all by the finished product. It was gooey, cheesy and toasted but it was also really boring and overly buttered on the outside. They give you only a small portion of their homemade ketchup... which I would have rather they had the choice of that or standard Heinz.   For the price I defiantly don't think it's worth it, but to each their own."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Great comfort food. Always good service and smiling, friendly faces."}
{"text":"I have felt misunderstood English isn't my first language and they seemed be impatient with me wen I was trying to order food."}
{"text":"Maybe I had higher hopes for this place and had built it up in my head as being fantastic, because of the things I had heard about it but I was disappointed.  The place is super small I think I tripped over the stools 3 time while ordering to then finally sit down so I wouldn't hurt myself.    When I go to a restaurant or even a friends house and I get served a beverage in a plastic cup I get insulted, I'm not a child I won't brake you glasses. I hate it! so when I got my beer in a stadium plastic cup that was poorly pored with mainly foam I kind of died a little on the inside.  Maybe it was away to void doing dishes because of the size but that's wasteful.  The sandwich I had was good really good just on its own I had the Tim something. It really did not need the side of dipping sauce. But the sauce is what I came here for the Better ketchup.  The better ketchup fell flat it was like marinara sauce even looked like it. Super tomato flavour and I like tomatoes but it was not what I expected even seemed like the wrong consistency it was more like a hot sauce consistency then a dipping texture.   Then the stuff seemed other wise occupied when we went to pay our bills almost like we were forgotten about also most felt out of sorts. Specially because we had to fiddle on our phones to pay. The pay by e-transfer is completely acceptable at a farmers market but not at a brick and mortar establishment."}
{"text":"So bomb! I got the cowpuncher and it was really well done. The sandwich has Korean-style pulled pork, kimchi, provolone, and jalapeño jack. The flavors were really well-balanced: the pulled pork was accentuated --rather than overwhelmed -- by the kimchi and cheese. The owner was working while I was there and she was really personable and happy to serve, even though I walked in close to closing time.   Looking forward to trying the other items on the menu soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The grilled cheese is delicious and creative. Tomato soup, tater tots and pie milkshakes-all good. The space is small and not super comfortable though. Friendly and casual service."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying their food and I was pretty disappointed. The grilled cheese was average at best and the tater tots were just greasy McCain tater tots with melted process cheese on top. The biggest thing that set me off was that they are cash and e-transfer only. I can see cash only if they have an ATM on site but seriously? I saw at least two groups of people come in and leave for this reason. E-transfer is sketchy as you are not even sending it to someone that's in front of you... you send it to the owner, and you have to wait until they accept the transfer before you can leave."}
{"text":"Nice transformation of former Mission Diner space into something that I think can best be described as what it'd be like if Tubby Dog served grilled cheese instead of hot dogs. I got the one with kimchi and pulled pork; it's called the Hogpuncher (cheeky names for all of the sandwiches- many are named after Calgary bands and musicians; there's a Jann Arden, a Dudes, a Chixdiggit, etc, sadly no Raleigh yet and there won't be a Viet Cong until they decide on a new name but I digress) and it was BRILLIANT. $8 for a huge fistful of deliciousness, perfectly crispy and greasy but there's love there too, and a whole lot of flavour with very tender pork. I didn't think the sandwich would be enough for me (it was, actually) so I got a very nice cup of broccoli and cheese soup. It was excellent but absolutely nuclear hot and it's served in a paper coffee to-go cup- I hope they rethink this, because you cannot sip this as the cup is supposed to encourage because it's too hot- mine was anyway. I'm sure this is a work in progress so no biggie.   Two customers next to me were getting shakes of some description and they looked completely amazing.   A winner all around and the sort of place we don't have, yet, enough of in Calgary. Good comfort food, good value, class act."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese, tots and beer! Winning combo. I love a good jalapeño popper so even though I didn't trust them to be good on a sandwich, I gave the MBF a try (two cheeses, jalapeño poppers, marinara). It beat my expectations and then some. It was cheesey and rich but not greasy. A well balanced sandwich. The homemade ketchup was great. The only thing missing was a pickle.  The tots with nacho cheese were just what you'd expect when you want some tots. I think they gave us a small order though we asked and paid for a large.  The one local beer on tap (Cold Garden East Calgary Lager) was the perfect match for the sandwiches.  Service could have been better (the two servers were chatting with a customer  -friend and took a while to acknowledge us) but it's not the kind of place you go to for the service. The location is unexpectedly small and not super comfortable (tiny low stools and thin pillows on the benches) but totally fine for the 30 minutes you'll be there eating. Think of it like a food truck with minimal seating and your expectations will be correct.  It took around 10-15 mins to get our two sandwiches and tots, which was fine while we sipped our beers.  Cash only! (There's an ATM at the gas station across the street.)  We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh no! I hate to supply another negative review, but I work hard for my money, and don't like to waste it on poorly prepared food, nor do I want to eat food that provides little or no satisfaction. I'm sure that most people feel the same, but the reviews for this place seem to contradict this. Maybe it was an off day for the cook?  Not worth the visit . . . . $9.00 for a unbelievably greasy sandwich and a bit of home made ketchup.  I'm not a fan of ketchup so that didn't do much for me.  There was a puddle of grease on the serving dish when we picked it up, it was very off putting. It was however piping hot, so hot that we couldn't pick it up for a while.  Flavors were ok, but couldn't tell that there was any cheese with the brisket in the Tim Williams sandwich. It seemed over cooked.  Not sure if that was the style or by accident.   Service was ok, casual and friendly.  Definitely won't go back and won't be recommending this to anyone."}
{"text":"Awsome gem.  I discovered this place in my hood.   Very cute nice staff and perfect grilled sandwiches.  My new to go place. Looking forward to making it a go to spot with good company and great food and beers."}
{"text":"This place is great and has the possibility of becoming a hidden gem in Calgary.  This is grilled cheese for gown ups! Perfect for brunch.  I had the huevos rancheros and it was eggcellent!  The place is new and working on getting on its feet.  The owner is clearly a fan of local music as all sandwiches are named after local bands and I think all Calgarian and Canadians should be a proud supporter of this place.  Take it from me, an American...  Forget Subway and head across to the grate and barrel."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like them but it just didn't wow me. I had the MBF. The three diffrent cheeses were not powerful enough to really compliment themselves so just tested greasy with the jalopeno poppers. I've made much yummier grill cheese at home.  Payment via etransfer was convient if you don't have cash."}
