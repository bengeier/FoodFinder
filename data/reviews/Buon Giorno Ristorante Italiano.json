{"text":"Every time I'm on 17th I've always wondered if Buon Giorno has worth going to. This friday my boyfriend and I were trying to decide where to go for our date night. We tried to go to a few places on 17th but we couldn't wait to get seated. Lucky for us we decided to finally try Buon Giorno. It was a great decision. WE were seated right away.  We ordered the feast platter. We had to pick 3 pastas to share between 2. It was great! We got the mushroom and chicken  fettuccine  in cream sauce, rigatoni with Italian sausage and veal tortellini in tomato sauce. We both left full and satisfied.   Service was great, very welcoming and kind. I'll definitely go here again."}
{"text":"We went here for a company Christmas party, and our experience was overall really great. We were in a small room at the front (which was not the most ideal set up for a large group, but it worked.  I was a bit nervous when we sat down and I saw a special menu set for our group - as eek! everything had gluten. I asked the waiter if they have any options, and to my surprise he was MORE than accommodating. I was served gluten-free pasta, they made my main chicken and veal dish without flour, and also provided me creme caramel for dessert instead of the tabled tiramisu. I was overly impressed, and the food was great. We also had the house red wine, which was quite tasty."}
{"text":"We went here for supper, six of us. Good service, food and atmosphere!! Lots of choices and reasonable price for the location and venue! I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good tasting food, cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, dishes were served instantly."}
{"text":"I got the spaghetti bolognese.  Very tasty, hearty portion, and the waiter was very attentive and friendly.  It gets 4 stars because I was extremely thirsty and downed 4 glasses of iced tea.  I got charged for each refill!!!! $24.95 for a bowl of pasta, bread, and 4 glasses of iced tea seems a little steep to me."}
{"text":"This review may be confusing at first, but hear me out. I was out with my sister and a friend, and we had decided to go to a specific restaurant, which ended up being closed. So we head down 17th Avenue, and stopped at the old Chameleon, now called Sorno, instead. The owner and a patron were outside and told us we should come in, and that the concept of the bar was Italian tapas, plus he mumbled something about Tuesdays (it was Monday). I asked if they were open, and they said of course, and then I asked if we should come back Tuesday - I thought he said they weren't officially open until then, and he said no! that the food was great. So we decided to sit on the patio, and waited about 10 minutes until we got our menu. The menu was for Buon Giorno! All of us gave each other the WTF?! So we decided to stay - as the owner was still smoking at the entrance, and ordered. Our friend asked if there was a special on, to which the waiter suggested the veal chop. I order canneloni, and my sister some sort of vegetarian pasta. We receive our buns (cold and hard), and some butter (also very hard). Our food comes out, and I have to say, for pasta, it's quite average, and for $17.00 not any different, than say, Fiore's down the street who charges half. The salad that came with our friends veal chop was quite good, if not a bit small.  After we finished the meal, we get the bill, and our friend's 'special' was $33.00!! Could not believe it! I'm not sure what the waiter thought he was asking, but to me, when someone asks if there is a special, it means if there's anything that is slightly cheaper or a deal for that day. Not sure how he would've asked the waiter any other way to convey that message. I feel we should've been told before hand that we weren't getting food from Sorno, but from Buon Giorno. Yes, we could've left, but it would've been extremely awkward, and to be honest, we were all starving."}
{"text":"I have been going to Buon Giorno for 15 years or so... but amazingly, haven't been back for the last 5.  No particular reason, just a matter of opportunity.  But you know what?  This restaurant is kinda like an old friend that you know will always be \"there,\" but you may not speak to for a while.   Heck, there's always a new restaurant I want to try, so I've been overlooking Buon Giorno for a while.  But the opportunity WAS there recently, so our group of five stopped in for an earlier 5:30 dinner.  I'm glad we did.  I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.  It's older school, as far as decor, but the dim lighting and ambiance feels \"right\" for date night and red wine and Italian food.   The servers are, from my experience, experienced Euro-style professional servers.  Meaning they know how to do this, and have been doing it for a long time.  By choice.  Prompt, polite, efficient, professional.  No BS.    Our food was on our table surprisingly fast.  Maybe because we were there so early, but nonetheless: everything, service-wise, was exceptional.  There were a few appetizers on the go, and I followed with a seafood salad and then a main (seafood / meat pasta).   I have to say that everything I ate was fantastic.  The flavors in my pasta raised the bar.  My only quibble was portion sizing.  Most things on the table I could have eaten more of.    That's the only reason I deduct a star.    However, I know I will be back sooner rather than later... and maybe order an extra appetizer or two to fill the portion void.    I otherwise enjoyed the experience very much."}
{"text":"Good pasta. I had the carbonara. It was a bit dry and salty for my taste, but it has been around forever, so it must know it's clientele by now. Kids like the ravioli. Parking in the back. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Simply put, Buon Giorno is one of my fave restaurants for Italian cuisine. Bit of a throwback in terms of decor, style and service, but in a good, retro- traditional authentic sort of way. There's a noisy European vitality to dining at Buon Giorno that always pleases me. Of course the bottom line is that the food is consistently top-notch.   For starters you can't go wrong with the calamari in a lightly seasoned, somewhat zippy, tomato sauce. The Insalata Mista is always fresh, with firm tomatoes, olives, crisp onions and lettuce, drizzled with a light vinaigrette.   While I tend to stick with veal, I do rotate my veal selections from their menu and each has something going for it, my favorite is the Involtini Portofino. Firm prawns, milk-fed veal, wrapped and rolled and covered with a zesty tomato and wine sauce accompanied by a serving of penne is my idea of a perfect Italian meal. to complement the wonderful meal I can heartily recommend a glass or half litre of Chianti Ruffino.  To finish the meal...well, as predictable as it seems in an Italian restaurant, I'm a sucker for the Tiramisu.   Hmm, my mouth is watering just from typing this up. I think a return to Buon Giorno within the next few days is in order. Incidentally, I'd strongly recommend reservations, particularly for a Friday or Saturday evening as the place is always packed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A good solid family Italian resto. Not fancy, good prices, great prices for bottles of wine. Try the Spaghetti a la vongole. Absolutely delicious. This is a comfy place to go, not upscale or dressy but great food when you just want to exhale."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I went there on Saturday night with a few friends and fell in love. Every single dish was delicious. The whole vibe of the place was nice and cozy. All in all, I'll be back time and time again. In fact, I have a feeling this is where you'll find me every weekend."}
{"text":"A Real Italian restaurant, not flashy, ambience hasn't changed since  I moved to Calgary in '87.   Authentic Italian Food, most delicious pastas in town. Bruschetta is to die for. Prices are resonable for the level of quality you get. Service is impeccable"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around long before I was even born. Yet I only tried it this week (so many good restos in this city, so little time!) The decor is definitely dated (very 70s), but I kind of like the old school feel to it. It is cozy and inviting and seems like a good place to bring a date or even for dinner with friends.   The food and service were both great. We arrived at 5:30, so we were the only group in the restaurant (by the time we left at 6:45, the place was almost full). Even as the restaurant started filling up, the service was still friendly and attentive. We started with a caesar salad and it was delicious. It was well dressed and garlicky, which worked for me as I'm a total garlic lover! I had the Penne Puttanesca. I asked for it with no anchovies as I strongly dislike anchovies. But it was delicious!! The capers and olives brought a nice saltiness to the dish and worked really well with the tomato sauce. It was a generous portion too and I ate the whole thing (it was that good). Also ordered was the Veal Scaloppini and the Lamb Ossobucco special. Both were given rave reviews as well.  If you want something modern and hip, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. But if you want good Italian food and a homey atmosphere, Buon Giorno is a good option. Their prices are also pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday dinner and I am appalled by the horrible service.  Obviously they wanted only certain kind of people there since our neighbors were treated differently. The food is okay but we wouldn't go to a place where people are treated unequally."}
{"text":"Buon Giorno has been around for many many years----and there is a couple of GOOD reasons why.....as many other restaurants disappear from the Calgary scene.  FOOD----large menu of Italian staples----all delicious----all well priced----all portions are generous.             Pastas are all perfectly \"al dente\"  and tasty             Veal --no matter how ordered--tender and tasty             All other dishes never fail to satisfy  WINE----lots to choose from both by the glass and the bottle----reasonably priced  STAFF----many have been there for years and  years and all operate as professionals.  NOISE LEVEL----tends to be a bit on the loud side ---but that is not due to overly loud music bombarding your senses BUT RATHER  a full restaurant with lots of well fed well served happy people......  If you haven't been here TRY IT      This place is a Calgary Gem"}
{"text":"I'll give them 2 stars but not Michelin stars...2 stars because they employ good hard working people in the back.....not very Italain food just the names on the menu are I italian. ..."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from someone who works in the area and eats here often. Service was pretty good. However the food was terrible, I should have sent back my lunch but didn't. I ordered Shrimp and asparagus risotto, what came to the table was undercooked orzo pasta in a tomato sauce with asparagus and shrimp with their tails still on. When I asked the waiter why it wasn't (what I understood to be risotto) risotto he said the they made all kinds of risotto. I told him that maybe then it should say that on the menu, or you should mention it to every customer who orders it so there is no confusion. He said well now you know. Yes now I know after paying $20 for a terrible risotto dish. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the Feast for Three. We were able to pick three different pastas (all amazing) and shared for $50 between three people. I loved the warm bread and authentic Italian feel. Highly recommend the Spaghetti Carbonara!"}
{"text":"I have been Buon Giorno before I join yelp. They always keep the services and food quality to the higher standard including the price are little high though. From appetizer Bruschetta to main course Lasagna, Pasta or Risotto. This restaurant atmosphere is very cozy for romantic dinner with a glass of wine. Overall tutto perfetto to food quality and services.  I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  This has been my parent's favourite restaurant for a long time so we all decided to have a big family dinner here. The only way we got a table for 9 for a Saturday night was via reservation. It was packed when we got there around 7 and still pretty full when we left. I really suggest making a reservation if you're planning on eating here on a Saturday night.   I've read a lot of reviews that complain about how outdated this restaurant is and though that is true I found it quite charming. It really shows the character of this place and of the owners. This restaurant has been around for a long time and I love how they've kept to their roots instead of trying to continually catch up with today's trends. I found it to add to the experience rather than take away from it.  The food was fantastic. No one at our table had any complaints. We got a few appetizers to share, which were delicious, moved on to our meals and finished with dessert. We went for Italian and that's exactly what we got, delicious authentic Italian.   Considering how busy the restaurant was, service was awesome. Our server was so attentive, informative, charming, funny...he was pretty great.   A+ all around."}
{"text":"A family restaurant in desperate need of a renovation. The service was good, the food was excellent.   I would come here again for the pasta. The risotto balls I had as an appetizer were not the best."}
{"text":"Good place for dinner on 17th ave downtown.  IMHO it is better than Fiore as the selection is better, and so is the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Found on yelp.  Reviews looked promising and they were not wrong.  Delicious authentic Italian.  We were a part of 4 and a toddler and we ordered 2 pasta feasts so we could try 6 dishes and they were delicious and there were left overs. Great service even though it was a busy Monday and there was only 2 wait staff.  We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"When i think of some of the best places I have been I think of buon giorno. I think of the awesome staff that fills up your wine glass when they notice its getting empty. The kind older man who gave my friend and I rose because he said every woman deserves a rose. I think of the tasty pasta Dishes for a super low price.  Or how about the authentic atmosphere?   The place is usually packed during the dinner hustle but its pretty empty in the afternoons.   I highly recommend these guys. The know how to make you a 4 or 5 course meal in style! Definately one of my favourite italian style resturants!"}
{"text":"I had last been to Buon Giorno about 7 years ago, and nothing seems to have changed since then. Same great food and service, plus the decor still looks like it is from that Italian restaurant from a movie in the 1960's.  We decided to do a multi-course sharing meal with an appetizer, pasta and main, with dessert to follow if we had space.  We started with the Scampi appetizer, which had 4 scampi in a great garlic butter sauce. Portion size could have been a little bigger but they were perfectly done, and the rolls we got were used to soak up all the delicious sauce.  For our pasta dish we went with the Carbonara. Not as creamy as I normally expect Carbonara to be in restaurants, but more traditionally done. Loads of bacon in the dish too.Was delicious and devoured in seconds. Feel like all the pastas are big enough for a main, even through they say they are appetizer portions (besides the lasagna).  For our main dish we went with the Ossobuco Alla Milanese, as it has been years since either of us have had this dish. Good size portion, meat fell off the bone, and the sauce was unreal good. The boy sucked the marrow from the bones and proclaimed it delicious.  No dessert as we were really full and taking some of the Ossobuco home for lunch the next day.  Great meal and looking forward to going back again. They have a couple \"feasts\" on the menu which sound like great value for money and want to give those a try."}
{"text":"It's a very decent Italian restaurant. I went there with my friends. There are so many people around 6pm, so you need to book a table early. The location is on 17th ave, so it is pretty hard to find a parking spot. I really suggest people go there early. The spaghetti is very delicious. I like the mussels we ordered, they are so fresh and well-flavoured."}
{"text":"A throw-back to the 70s... Good food without any crescendos.  We had the veal parmigiana and linguine vongole, and both were good. Both tomato sauces were good, and very different flavours.  Service was very good, and the kitchen obviously competent. Sure helps when have enough staff to handle the dinner rush. Would return, and can recommend to those who know this style of dining from decades ago..."}
{"text":"Didn't think much of it a few years ago but had an excellent lunch there recently. Menu items aren't as numerous which I think is a good thing. Will go back again. Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Great solid Italian pasta place.  Nice food and great service being very attentive to our allergies.   Nothing particularly fancy about the food but everything o the menu is just overall well done.  We had the lamb shank special which was very tender and flavorful.  The cannelloni was very well done with the cheese giving it good balance.  So much better than their competition down the street across from Western."}
{"text":"Yum. I went with my husband and we were both loving the pasta dishes. We ordered pasta for two: linguine with seafood in a tomato sauce, veal stuffed pasta in a rose sauce and fettucine with scallops in a cream sauce.  The pasta itself was perfect - toothsome, firm and plump. The sauces were all different tasting and delicious. The portion of the pasta platter is plenty for two.  Wine by the glass is very affordable, particularly considering your on 17 Ave. I can't wait to go again. Location, affordable prices and hearty Italian food make this place a winner in my books."}
{"text":"Hit up Buon Giorno on a Friday night. From the outside the place looks a little worn and run down compared to the surroundings of 17th Ave. Upon entrance we were greeted by a number of friendly staff and they were able to seat us right away. The place is rather large on the inside with a brick fireplace in the middle of the room. The decor has an old school Italian restaurant feel. Once seated the service was prompt and friendly. We came for pasta and the menu had a variety of options. I had the seafood linguini with tomato sauce good portion size and tasted excellent. Calamari, muscles and good size prawns. They didn't skimp on the seafood either. I went with my three boys and they all enjoyed their meals. For kids and smaller eaters they offer half sizes. If you looking for good old fashion Italian with that old school Italian restaurant feel this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is a Caron family favourite. Whenever all the members of my family congregate in our hometown of Calgary, Buon Giorno always happens. Always! We no longer need peruse the menu, because we each have our go-to preferences. Gotta give top notch points to this place for their consistency! Never disappointing, always as good as the last time.  The pasta dishes are authentic and scrumptious, and the calamari is A+. Their house wine is the perfect pairing with an order of Gnocci della Mama (my all-time fave). Half orders are also available, which is great if you wish to try some minestrone zuppa or a salad before your main course.   To bring the meal to a close, we always split Tartuffo, ice cream with a soft chocolate liquid centre and a hardened shell of deliciousness on the outside. Consistently decadent!  Their decor is rather old-school, and towards the back of the restaurant there are no windows where you are surrounded by rustic wood beams and a mural depicting an Italian countryside scene. Buon Giorno has not changed in all the years we have been going there, which adds to its charm. The waiters have all been the same from since I was a young child, and they know the timing for bringing the meals/clearing and possess exquisitely quick wine pouring abilities. I always go back, and will continue to do so, as long as Buon Giorno stays the way it is."}
{"text":"Fairly priced, high quality authentic homemade Italian food. The decor resembles restaurants you'd visit in Italy and the service is outstanding. I love how it's decorated for Christmas during December. Best suited for adults. This is one of the best restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"I like this place.  We have been here many times.  It is solid, Italian staple food - pastas and veal dishes mostly.  If you are looking for good old fashioned Italian food and Chianti, I highly recommend Buon Giorno."}
{"text":"Food 5/5  Service 5/5 - server was slammed and didn't chit chat, but was incredibly efficient Location 4/5 - what do you expect going to a restaurant on 17th. Parking is a brute, but worth it for this place. Ambiance 5/5 perfect little italian place  Thanks for the experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"Great little (noisy street side) patio  Had the caprese salad and rigatoni with sausage  Sausage was little meat balls  Salad a little oily, pasta and sausage were nice, service good"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food. I had the veal chop with mushroom and peppercorn sauce and it was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth.  The risotto was on point and the mussels with basil cream sauce was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here only 3 times and at intervals of a few years in between.  Food is good, service is good, prices are good: considering location.  The greatest thing for me at this establishment is the WARM BREAD at your table when you sit down - which won the 4th star in my review!  I shall give them yet another chance and see if they win their 5th star from me!"}
{"text":"Buon Giorno has been a favorite for the entire (almost) 20 years I've lived in Calgary.  My Dad knew of the restaurant and took me out the first time he came to visit me after I had moved to Calgary.  It has been a consistent favorite ever since.  This and one other restaurant are the only two my Dad ever wants to go to when he comes to town and he has said it is because of their service.  I would have to agree.  Even when its packed the service is outstanding.  If I don't know what to pick on the menu I'm asked \"what are you in the mood for\" and I've never been disappointed with what has been put together for me or pulled off the menu.  My most recent visit was for a Christmas function with co-workers and I'm still shocked at all of the food and vino (not to mention desserts) we were able to get for the price.  It may be a bit old school and not terribly hip but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to Buon Giorno.  I want and I get consisently good food and service and a great night out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place. The service has been good and the food tastes good. Tonight we had a large group and at the end of the night, even though we had asked for split bills, they gave us a $982 tab to break out among 16 people. It was explained that their system is not accommodating. I am now going to avoid it with large groups which is a shame. But time for some updating. Get a system that isn't going to ruin an otherwise enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of this place. It reminds me of the restaurants that have been around for a long time, and you can really get to know the waiters. The menu was large I think there were something like 40 items on it, it was difficult to choose. Since everything sounded sooo good.  In the end I decided to go with veal cutlets and noodles, and a tomato sauce. I don't think I have ever had better Italian food. However my only gripe about this place was the portion size, I was rather hoping to see a lot more noodles. It seemed to me that they just gave me a ladle full.  The prices range from 15-25$ a plate per person"}
{"text":"I had heard really good things about this restaurant so my boyfriend and I decided to try it out one night. To be fair, I was already in a cranky mood because I was SO hungry, but this restaurant honestly just pissed me off. We walked in and it was relatively slow, so the restaurant was quiet. Server was the not nice/not mean type...just kind of there. As soon as we were seated I ordered appetizers, because again I was starving. We ordered a shrimp type of dish and it was SO SMALL I think both of us only had 2 bites. I had some bread to tide me over so I didn't get too upset about it. Fast forward WAY too long for a slow night, we finally get our meals. Which were disgusting. I'm not trying to be rude, and I am seriously the least picky person I know, but the food was NOT good! I could have made it better at home, lower than Olive Garden quality (no offense to Olive Garden). After downing my wine, I asked for the bill and nearly choked when I saw it was $80!!!! I have NO problem paying money for good food (seriously, I'm not cheap)...but that was a blatant rip off. I left SO angry because I was still hungry and out $80. Should have just gone to Wendy's, I probably would have been more satisfied and it would have been a lot cheaper. I don't get how this place has such great reviews, but maybe we just went on an off night? I've been to Italy and trust me, this is NOT good Italian food."}
{"text":"I stay 2 blocks from this restaurant and have been eating here for the past two years. The food is excellent. Although the service has deteriorated. The server was very impatient and had no decency to talk to his guests. I had asked if my chicken could be split in two plates. He got the plate and said to do what I want to do with this. Moreover throughout my dinner he had no patience and seemed like a rush affair. I am never going back here again."}
{"text":"We had a pasta craving one night so did the usual search on Yelp and came up with this gem of a restaurant.  Apparently this place has been around the city for many years.  We've walked past Buon Giorno on many occasions on 17th Avenue.  Never gave it much thought as the exterior of the restaurant looked like a throwback to the early 90s and needed a major facelift.  But we were so wrong.  This place is very good.  Upon first entrance, the restaurant was quite large and inviting.  We came by on a weekday evening and it was a busy place.  My partner and I shared the pasta feast for two, which is a platter of three types of pasta for $38.  Highly recommend.  Our only regret was not saving enough room for dessert. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, every time I crave comforting Italian food, I go here. It's really cozy inside, and the service I've received has always been great. I've ordered many different things on the menu, and they're all delicious! It's not super upscale or anything, so if you're looking for fancy Italian, I wouldn't go here. But if you want comfyness, and to stuff yourself until your sick from pasta and bread, come here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian seafood restaurant. Great for dates, great for families. Amazing ambiance and the food is top notch. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For the love of Italy, this place is seriously amazing! From the outside it doesn't look like much, a little hole in the wall on 17th ave... but don't be fooled their pasta is amazing and the decor is literally taken from a tiny restaurant in the heart of Italy. The staff are lovely and the pasta feast is perfect to share with your friends and family. Many of the seafood pastas are delightful but I have to say the Carbonara is my favorite! Reasonably priced and relatively quick service this is my go to place whenever I'm craving to head back to Italy. I simply adore the single stem roses on the tables and the yellow stucco walls, just lovely! This place is top notch, check it out!"}
{"text":"Well hello Buon Giorno. Fancy meeting you for my birthday supper.  I remember Buon Giorno's from way back, like, way back before I ever moved to Calgary. I'm pretty sure we came here for dinner with my aunt and my cousin. It must've been good, because it stuck in my mind all of these years.  Fast forward to Monday night. Best friend wanted to know what I was doing for my birthday dinner. I was feeling rather sickly, so wasn't up for all that much. She suggested comfort food was the way to go, maybe pasta. She also needs gluten free pasta. Onto a Yelp search, who should pop up? Buon Giorno's! We decided to try it out.  The menu is literally pasta... pasta and more pasta. And veal. And some pasta. And maybe some scallops. When best friend asked about gluten free options, she was told they could make pretty much anything without flour. Now, she couldn't have all pastas as gluten free, I think they only have one or two options, but they are options nonetheless... and take your pick of sauces, fish and the likes, Buon Giorno's will do it up all nice and tasty for you.  I got one of the veal dishes, since veal is their specialty. I'm pretty sure it didn't take me long to inhale my plate of food. It also left me feeling a lot better. Turns out something comforting is exactly what I needed!"}
{"text":"Solid italian choice on 17th. Pasta feast is a great idea (try 3 different pastas for the price of 2 regular size pastas) LOVED LOVED LOVED my friends carbonara but my sausage and mushroom risotto was nothing special. Also tried the red pescatore and cannelonni, both pretty good. Do really like the cozy ambience and the old school decor (saw an old photo of Ralph Klein dining there). Definitely come back for the carbonara."}
{"text":"Buon Giorno is located near the main intersection of 17th Avenue and 7 Street SW.   As many of you know 17th Avenue SW in Calgary can get pretty busy.  My girlfriend and I haven't met up in a while, so we decided to meet up for dinner.  She lives in the 17th Avenue area so Buon Giorno came to mind.    It was a Thursday, around 7PM.  We made reservations and got in right on the dot with a table waiting for us.  I'd say that the atmosphere is a little crowded but has a romantic feel with the dimmed lights.  The tables just seem pretty close together...maybe it was just the area we got seated in.  Our server came by and dropped some complimentary bread and butter off at the table.  We just went with water and looked at the menu.  Everytime I come to Buon Giorno, I usually get the Pasta Feast (for 2 or more). The Pasta Feast, in my humble opinion is just perfect for two with a little left over.  I suggested we get the feast because we get to choose 3 different pastas under the 'Pasta E Risotti' section and its just a perfect fill.  We decided to go with: Lasagne De Pesce (Seafood Lasagna), Fettucini Tettrazini (mushrooms and chicken breast in cream sauce) and Penne All Arrabiata (It says its Spicy with green olives, onions, mushrooms, tomato sauce).  It all came out on a big tray, and we dug in.  Everything was great and tasty...nothing too too fancy, but just perfect.  For me, the seafood lasagna reigns supreme! The lasagna has chunks of seafood inside.  It was delicious. They didn't cheap out on the feast, thats for sure.    One thing I should mention is, the service at Buon Giorno sometimes can be non-existent.  The servers don't come enough to give it a 5 star.  But if you want some pasta and don't care if you don't get much service.. go down to Buon Giorno!  And as I said in my review, I do suggest the Pasta Feast!  The price for the Pasta Feast is about $~34!"}
{"text":"The seafood risotto is very good... And the lasagna was great as well... This restaurant looks like a family owned restaurant, nothing very fancy, but the food is very good... I would go back there!!"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall Italian place with amazing service and lovely pasta dishes. Always get the pasta feast to try a couple different kinds and I've never been disappointed. Appies are great sizes to keep you happy while you're waiting for mains. I wish I got our servers name but he had dark hair and was quite tall. Compliments to him!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants for supper in Calgary.  My favorite dish is their Cozze Marinara [mussel dish].  I love the simplicity of the way they prepare the food.  I also like their Italian waiters who are seasoned waiters... and for them to last long in their jobs, the company must be offering something good.  All these give me a sense of tradition in that restaurant.  Simplicity really sums the place up for me.  It's like enjoying a home cooked meal and for some reason, I just feel at home coming back to that place again and again.  The restaurant is also nicely situated on 17th Avenue.  Its location alone gives a certain vibe fit for a very life-giving dining experience.  Sitting on the front patio makes a perfect spot for people watching while dining and visiting with friends."}
{"text":"Woww, I haven't been here for almost 10 years! Today I decided to play a visit, and surprisingly, food here was just as good as 10 years ago! Not even a bit of disappointment, everything was great!, Same great service, same great atomsphere, same great food.  We ordered steamed muscle with basil cream sauce for appertizer, creamy basil sauce is so light n refreshing, prefect compliement to the muscle  osso buco and seafood linguini for main course.  Osso buco was veal meat braised in rich tomato sauce, veal meat is prefectly cooked and so tender (I prefer the meat to be more tender :D) but it was still very good. Seafood linguini with white wine sauce, simple yet very tasty, seafood portion was very generous!  My dinner was ended with tiramisu! Nothing too excited, but it's good :D"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Went here for dinner with a friend and toddler while in Calgary.  Toddler had a bit of a meltdown right after we ordered!  But staff was great!  Actually they served our food super quick! Probably because the toddler was crying but after food arrived quickly toddler was butter.  Did I mention the food was great?   Only thing... They need more high chairs."}
{"text":"Buonasera Buon Giorno. Your homey Italian feel is just what we required this evening and to of course reacquaint ourselves with your fine establishment once again. I really like this place. is it the best Italian food in the world? No, and I am pretty sure everyone working in the kitchen has never seen Italy, but the food is tasty and comforting. Every time we come here, I always over dress. It's on 17th ave, I want to go out and get pretty, and I walk in and then remember, oh wait, I am at Buon Giorno. Casual town. Every Saturday there are at least 2 reservations for birthday parties of 15 plus people,  who are differing generations of Italian descent. The wait staff is all male in their late 40's, I respect that, no cheap tricks and short skirts here!  This place is just fun! Fake brick, fake flowers, it's like the Disney version of Italy.  So bring your kids, bring your nonna, eat a ton of pasta, drink some wine of differing quality and sit back and soak up the ambiance. Elbows on the table? You are gonna have to in order to hear the person across the table."}
