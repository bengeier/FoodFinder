{"text":"Amazing, fresh Indian food. I heard about it on Metro Morning and have been twice this week already. The chicken biriyani is incredible, with spices and flavours I've never had before. I also had the chick pea and sweet potato dish with also did not disappoint. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and we were one of only two tables. We ordered a lamb dish which was lovely and a shrimp dish which we also enjoyed. However, the Chicken Biryani, for which the chef is apparently famous, was so overpowered by cardamom we couldn't eat it. We have had many Biryani dishes and this definitely was not seasoned properly. We asked the server to taste it or to have the chef taste it but this didn't get done. And nobody addressed our complaint.We were charged for the dish anyway. The restaurant was clearly not busy so we were perplexed as to why the chef did not pay attention to our request to taste the dish, There are so many good Indian restaurants in the city that I am surprised they don't seem to care what their customers think. They should be aware that there is competition out there and Indian food lovers like us will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a decent addition to this area. 
Their website is almost nonexistent so not sure what market are they aiming for nowadays. I recall the chef from his outpost known for biryani eons ago. So with a friend in tow we decided to drop by on a Friday evening. Hmm the place was empty (they really need to get the word out). This was a scouting trip as we were looking for a space to host a luncheon for an elders landmark birthday. 
The space is clean and functional with a surprisingly large space for the kitchen. The tandoor (clay oven) is a welcome sight. I think their plates need an a big overhaul as they are another example of form over function. 
We ordered an app and two mains.
Here is the play by play
Jack fruit shami kebabs. This is geared towards vegans (I recall first trying jack fruit dishes in Vancouver by celebrity chef which were underwhelming to say the least). I am quite familiar with the taste profiles of this dish so find it a bit odd with the jack fruit addition. Could be great if you are a vegan I suppose.
Almond tikka. This was quite good with a nice char on the meat and the tandoor working its magic with keeping the meat juicy. 
Butter Chicken. Hmm I am partial to another spot nowadays as otherwise I don't order this dish normally (had to try it for the upcoming luncheon event) and found it to be OK. There is quite a bit of butter in this dish so be careful when mopping up the sauce with the bread. Decent.
We ordered a trio of bread i.e. garlic nan, paratha and a roti. All were decent.
Mini update
5 Beans chat was very good as spice level not held back even though I couldn't identify all the beans unless green peas and cranberry raisins count
Pakoras: good version of pakoras not greasy. I enjoyed the tamarind sauce as well.
Palak Paneer: Not greasy as that's the norm here in North America. The spice level gets lost IMO on this dish"}
{"text":"Vile, the chicken was rock hard but tasteless, as was the okra.The kebob was a lump of salt; the peas pulao was doused in some sort of rose flavouring. For 85$ we expected an edible meal, do yourself a favor and stay far away."}
{"text":"What a great find. We talked about going everyday this week after reading about it on the CBC. I'm sure soon it will be reservations only! Supporting my local businesses. Can't wait to try the entire menu."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for light Indian food...service is excellent and food seems fairly authentic...I'll probably come back for more."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. This was a terrific meal, started with complimentary pappadum and then two apps and four starters for four of us. Every dish was ezxcellent from prawn curry to beef short ribs (huge portion), lamb curry and a great veg dish. This was a Saturday night and the resto was empty--a pity because this is surely one of the best Indian restaurants in Toronto, certainly the best we've been to."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. Only 2 customers were ahead of me. Got free papad. The Five Bean Chat appetizer was quickly served and was amazing! The Seafood Miramar took a long time to be served almost to the point of being famished. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've eaten my share of Indian food and the Spice Indian ranks among the best. Excellent food in a nice environment."}
{"text":"There are a ton of Indian options in the city, and, based solely on one visit, Spice Indian Bistro deserves a place right at the top of the heap.

We arrived around lunchtime on a weekday and the place was empty. I took a quick look at their promising lunch menu and opted to try the Lamb Khadi (\"Served with fluffy basmati rice and a house salad with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and beetroot with a mango-chilli vinaigrette\").

It arrived a short time later and certainly looked and smelled delicious. And that was nothing compared to how amazing it tasted.

This is a seriously scrumptious dish. The various spices ensured that each bite had something new to discover, and honestly, I can't recall the last time I ate an Indian dish that was so complex and layered in its flavors.

And this is to say nothing of the lamb itself, which was astoundingly tender and delicious.

(The accompanying salad was quite yummy, as well.)

My only complaint would be the disheartening lack of spice in the dish. I feel like the chef has decided to tone down the heat for his North American customers, and this is a mistake, in my humble opinion. When I eat Indian food, I want to feel that spiciness in my very bones."}
{"text":"The food at Spice Indian Bistro is exceptional - each dish individual and remarkable. The service and atmosphere compliment the superb food. The food is as good as the best I have had in India - flavourful, fresh, distinctive.  Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Literally a hole in the wall at Sherborne and Queen bus stop east side that explodes with flavour and pure culinary artistry.  The kitchen is open so you can admire the chef at work and his delightful wait staff lends a hand when needed so that service, while not quick, allow the luxury of savouring the most delicious and freshly spiced Indian food I have tasted in the city!  The desserts are to die for, we shared the lamb and seafood mains and one appetiser along with garlic naan and biryani was more than enough!  Cannot recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Hot and fresh. Took a few minutes to receive but the results were worth the wait. A huge improvement for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Moss Park neighbourhood I proudly call home. Stopped in to try them for takeout. Ordered the gosht nizami (lamb), saag paneer and garlic naan. Everything was fantastic!  Nice watching the chef make everything fresh in their open kitchen as we waited. The place was a bit of a ghost town when we were there - I'm hoping word gets out so we can keep them around."}
