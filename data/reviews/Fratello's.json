{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. We ordered two simple pasta dishes to go and they were not good. The sauce was too spicy for a basic sauce. The meatballs were dry with no flavor...the sausage wasn't better. For $11, you would expect better. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Never had bad experience until tonight... Been here many times. Walked in at 6:00 not busy few open tables 4 seats open at bar. We put our  name in for a table of 2. Hostess told us any minute  So, over hour later after 2 martinis and half bottle of wine complained to manager & hostess about not being seated yet, they blew it off said they can never predict Hostess didn't admit that she told us any minute. (Tell your guess a hour or longer we would have left)  Obviously we were skipped because few names after us were crossed off. we we're so disappointed how they handled it!!!! Not a away to treat your regular customers!"}
{"text":"The outside building might not look like much, but this is by far the best Italian restaurant on the west side of Clevelsnd.   Portions are huge and prices are great !!!"}
{"text":"This is our special occasion place, but the food is so worth it.  Excellent Northern Italian food and wonderful deserts."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service. Always consistent. Busy restaurant.  No reservations taken for under 6 people. Well with the wait!!"}
{"text":"I love Fratello's. We sit at the bar for dinner. The service is exceptional and the food is excellent. Love the Fratello sauce. Spent New Year's Eve here with family and friends a few years ago. Small intimate, lovely Italian restaurant in Avon Lake."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go when visiting Avon! The veal and chicken Fratello are beyond good. We add the mushrooms and it really makes the dish that much better. The shrimp Alfredo was awesome very creamy and lots of huge shrimp. Our server Bill is a true professional, amazing server and such a nice guy. He always remembers us and takes great care. If you haven't been this is a must go. Ignore the outside and old school feel the food will delight."}
{"text":"Service was 5 stars.  The atmosphere was comfortable and more suitable for an older crowd.  Food was very good but the menu was limited.  Don't expect to be able to make modifications  to the choices.  The chicken is all floured before the night starts so I couldn't get grilled chicken.  The serving sizes were huge.  I had the shrimp fratello and it was a delicious lemon-butter sauce.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly.  The only negative was the unfriendly bartender that told me she had no wine or martini lists when there was a wine list.  She pointed to her board saying that's what she had.  Overall we probably would not go back for awhile but it was a good experience"}
{"text":"My wife ordered sausage with her linguini.  It was dry and had triple the fennell spice you'd expect.  Here's the weird part.  We paid the bill and then asked the server what was with the sausage?  She replied that it is CHICKEN SAUSAGE.  Ugh.  That should be advertised in the menu.  My Veal Parmesan was terrific. Shame on you Fratellos for that digesting sausage material."}
{"text":"I went to Fratello's recently ,and I have to say this is by far one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. When we walked in, the atmosphere is very relaxing with a bar to the right hand side of the entrance, and the dining area was very clean, and situated nicely.
   We did not have to wait more than 3 minutes to be sat at a table for four. Once we were seated, our server was very prompt with taking our drink orders, and we were given glasses of water (it doesn't sound like much, but it's nice to not have to ask). Before our meal orders were taken, we were given a basket of fresh Italian bread, and a dish of garlic butter spread (of which I am pretty sure came from heaven). Our drink orders from the bar arrived in a timely manner, and were fresh and cold.
   Our food got to the table in a very short time as well. Very fresh, hot, and made exactly to order. I don't think I have ever eaten a plate of chicken alfredo that was better than this! I also had the opportunity to taste the chicken Fratello (I highly recommend this dish) and the pork tenderloin (Highly recommended as well), which were both outstanding. Our server was very prompt with making sure our drinks and waters were full through the duration of our visit. 
   From what I could tell, the price of the food and drinks was well worth the quality of food they offer. I would definitely suggest this restaurant to anyone who is a fan of Italian food, or any one who is looking to try a new place in the Avon, Ohio area."}
{"text":"Try their new Escargot Diabolos. Hot and delicious! As usual, their Veal Saltimbocca is is die for. And my fav is the Shrimp Fratello; a lovely treat for which there is no equal."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fantastic food. Italian fine dining at it's best. Warm and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend for the first time and got a table right away.  The service was great the food was great. I got the Chicken Parmesan and I couldn't finish it all, which is rare for me. The only bad thing I would say about this place is that the tables are too close together."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Kind of small and cozy. Wonderful menu, I love chicken Fratello and my husband usually gets chicken rollatini. Also artichokes Fratello! If you are looking for a fabulous dinner and a break from the chains check this place out - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Fratellos is an old school classic Italian restaurant located on the West Side. Located close to the lake, Fratellos is a smaller place but gives off that home feel atmosphere. Place is a little dated, but what matters is the food was pretty solid. I recommend anything with their homemade  Fratello sauce on it."}
{"text":"We love fratellos! It has a really great ambiance, small and authentic. The food is excellent as well. They have great specials and can pretty much put any kind of pasta together even if it is not on the menu. They have a fantastic eggplant rollatini (not easy to find in cleveland). It is listed as an appetizer but they turned it in to a meal for me. Extensive wine list is also a plus. 

Make reservations, they are always busy!"}
{"text":"Its 6:00 pm on a Saturday night.  Do you know where your Grandparents are?!?!?!

I do.  I'd bet my ass they are at Fratello's.  

Holy old people.  I was surprised an AARP card wasn't required for entry.  Its a small restaurant and the decibel at which people were talking was outrageous.  I guess I should have expected this will all the hearing aids in house, but it made our dinner almost unbearable.  At one point during my meal I heard someone say very loudly \"call 911!\" and I scrambled to dig my cell out of my purse.  I was about to hit send when I realized that someone at the table behind us was telling a joke and the 911 reference was the punch line.  You don't joke about that shit with this kind of crowd.

The food was eh.  Your typical Italian, but very bland.  I had to douse my entree with Parmesan and red pepper flakes just so it had some flavor.  I also thought it was pricey for what it was. 

Fratello's secured a spot on my local letdown list.  There are plenty of other non-chain Italian restaurants in the area that blow this place out of the water.  If its still in business in 40 years and elderly stomach prevents me from eating anything with actual taste, I may be back.  But until then, Peace...and Depends."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Gave it a few chances and just not a fan. It's an old Dairy Mart or an old Convenient and it's a place that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place and have visited it regularly for years now.  Just a great little place in such a brutal industry.  
-The food is great and always comes out piping hot.  
-The atmosphere is good. Can be a little loud at times, but it is small after all.
- The real winner for us is the service.  We have never been to a restaurant where wait staff turnover is low to non existent.  That tells me that the employee's are happy with management and that's the kind of business we want to spend our money at.  All the servers are professional and know what they are talking about if you have any questions.  

PS:  My age is 37 and I have no Grandkids."}
{"text":"Wow, only 3 reviews of Fratellos?  This place has been around for 20 years and its an awesome italian restaurant.  You can't be in the restuarant business for 20 years and not be good!

I've been going here for years and have never had a bad meal or experience.  If your looking for a great homecooked italian meal, this is the place.  Nice atomosphere, clean, and great wait staff and owners.  

Try the Chicken Fratello and the Artichokes with Fratello Sauce.  The Fratello sauce is great, its a lemon based sauce which is to die for.  Yes, I did just say that, I'd put it on everything if I could.  

This place is a little hard to find and there are no windows, but once you go in, you will know you arrived at the right place.  Well worth the trip for a great italian meal."}
{"text":"In an area with many options to eat, Fratellos blows them out of the water. My service has always been wonderful, the food far beyond compare, and deserts to die for! I love the eggplant!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The chicken parm is amazing, as is the fratellos sauce! This place is a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Love Fratello's. By far the best Italian on the west side . Fratello sauce is to die for ...dinner salads are fresh and not run of the mill. Inside nothing special . To go is excellent ..."}
{"text":"For us showing up closer to closing time and our server Bill taking care of us, including the 2 hostesses, and manager.. All I can say is it's very hard to find a restaurant in this day and age that takes care of the costumers like they all did. Great food, great service. Throw back, classic kind of spot!"}
{"text":"Ignore the outside look and go on to the ambience. Lovely inside.

Large portions - artichoke appetizer, chicken Fratello (Marsala) excellent served with pasta or spaghetti squash tonight (tasty). Extensive wine list too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The shrimp Fratello and the Bolognese sauce are amazing. Bill and Tammy are the best servers my boyfriend and I have ever had! Recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"love me some fratellos. i love any kind of italian yumminess. however, anything with the fratello sauce is a plus in my lovely opinion. my most recent obsession, the chicken rollatini. hello, buttery goodness. two huge chicken breasts rolled and filled with stuffing and then topped with mushrooms and that sauce as previously mentioned. can i bathe in this sauce. kidding. well not really. it is THAT good! 
pros: yummy food. good service. good wine list.
cons: small bar. small dining area. they do not take reservations.
overall i think fratellos knows how to make some heavenly dinners. 
i think that they could update their dining room, it seems a little outdated to me, but if youre going just for the food then by all means have at it. don't let a little outdated decor stop you in your tracks!"}
{"text":"If you  want quality  food  and  great service  I could  not  recommended  a better  place !  If you  leave here hungry  you did something  wrong .   The wait staff  is friendly  and  knowledgeable  . Thank you  for  the great service  and  the  food !"}
{"text":"Dear Fratello's: You've changed my life.......before you, the only Italian restaurants (if you can even call them Italian....) on the west side that I knew of were the trifecta of chains:  Brio, Buca and Manero's.  Many a time I drove past and didn't think of stopping b/c of the fugly strip mall exterior. I admit I was a bit turned off.  Then, one night we decided to check it out and Kate, our new favorite bartendress, sealed the deal. She holds court at the bar and treats you like family/a regular. Now we saddle up to the bar and are hooked. We are sorry we missed out on Fratello's goodness for a year on the west side proving you can't judge a book by it's cover!"}
{"text":"This was and always will be on my list of restaurants to eat at when I'm home for a visit. I've been eating here since I was a teenager and have never had a bad meal. The service is always top notch and professional. My favorite meal is the chicken rollatini. It is chicken with a breadcrumb stuffing that is dressed in Fratello sauce and marsala mushrooms. It is rich and satisfying. The entree also comes with a side of pasta and their pasta sauce which is very unique and delicious. The portion is huge so I either take half to go or I split with my mom.  I love a local Italian option where I can count on good food and service."}
{"text":"I've had real Italian food all over the country and this spot is average at best. The inside is outdated and not very appealing at all. It's really in need of a facelift and is located in a dumpy looking storefront section of town. Go for a drive to Little Italy and enjoy some real Italian food in a neighborhood that is vintage. Fratello's disappoints."}
{"text":"Fratellos has wonderful service. I recommend Mrs.Post. I got the clam dish and the large clams were good but the small clams tasted horrid but other wise it's a small restaurant and decent food."}
{"text":"Attentive and warm service (Debbie made our night) my side car wasn't tasting right (seems that bartender missed cognac on it) food was tasty although seemed that the Fratello sauce was on more than half of the menu, still we enjoy our meal with our lil' daughter.
If you know about wines let me tell you they have great selections at affordable prices. We'll go back in the future!"}
{"text":"Chicken fratello is awesome!!!  Salad and pasta are always great!  Love this restaurant!!!  Have been coming for years.  Staff is awesome!  They are always the same faces! :)"}
{"text":"Best Italian spot around, maybe even on the west side? SECRET MENU ITEM: Veal Neopolitan = easiest decision everytime."}
{"text":"Great \"white table cloth neighborhood joint\"! Our service was great; our waitress was classy yet warm and casual, and her recommendations were spot-on. Food was delicious and arrived quickly; huge portions for veal/chicken entrees meant boxes for  both of us. Wine list is extensive; we opted for a great bottle of Sangiovese ($22, though most of the wines are $30-$50.) Off the beaten path but worth the drive. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I was taken to lunch here by a boss as a Christmas lunch.  The food was pretty good, I will say that.  Our server was quiet, but very on the spot.  Food came out hot and without a long wait.  However, then the experience fell apart.  As part of a Secret Santa for my office, I needed a $15 Gift Certificate.  I waited with a co-worker in the lobby/bar area, and when the server saw us, she politely said we needed to wait for a gentleman to help us.  Said gentleman was on the phone.  He hung up the phone and walked in to the kitchen, very obviously avoiding our presence.  He walked back out of the kitchen, and as I raised my arm to get his attention, he pointed to the bar and said, \"I'm on the phone.\"  At that point, I would have left, but I was asked specifically for a gift certificate for this restaurant.  When the gentleman hung up, he turned to us and said, \"What do you need, I have thirty seconds.\"  Um... excuse me?  Once he heard that I needed a gift certificate, his demeanor changed, but his abruptness has soured me against this restaurant.  Decent food yes, but I can find other places with much better (and FRIENDLY) service."}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome restaurant. 
Though we went on a super busy Friday night- the staff could not have been more courteous or professional. 

We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and each had a salad. His ceases salad was delicious- dressing was fresh and seemed house made since it was distinctly good. It was a nice size and we would definitely get again. 
My house salad was very weak for the price and in comparison to my hubby's. It was super yummy but it was puny and was a bit of a bummer since I was starving from the wait. 
The calamari was really subpar as well. I wouldn't get it again because it wasn't anything special. 
I think the salad and the calamari were casualties from the very busy kitchen. I saw  others getting the same dishes and they looked different. 
Regardless, this restaurant still gets five stars!!! They were really struggling from the kitchen backup- but they handled it so well! True professionals. 
Also, when we got our entrees all was forgotten! I got the chicken rollatini and it was DIVINE. The fratellos sauce is what this restaurant is known for and rightfully so! A creamy, but light, but rich, unique sauce. Yum. I want to eat this again- huge portion of perfectly cooked and stuffed chicken covered in fratello sauce and mushrooms. Served with a side of pasta. Wow- this was one of the top meals I have had in awhile. 
My husband had the chicken Parmesan. Huge serving and so delicious. A classic done very right. The cheese was perfectly browned and bubbly and the chicken well seasoned. These two dishes made the evening. 

This is a real gem of a spot! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Chicken Rollatini is to die for!   I had not been to Fratello's for over ten years but decided tonight to give it a try.   Really glad I tried it again.   Great food.   The house salad is not your typical simple salad and the meatballs were very home made tasting.   Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here about once a month. It is our favorite date night location. The staff is excellent....the servers never change, and they are extremely knowledgable about the wine list. We've tried many items on the menu, but I'm stuck on the veal saltimbocca, and my wife won't deviate from the chicken fratello. Being from Avon Lake, I'm happy such a quality restaurant is in our own town.

The decor is extremely outdated...but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Good Italian cuisine, great friendly staff.  Reasonably priced. Large wine selection."}
{"text":"Ordering here was bad from the start. The women who answered the phone was SO rude. She couldn't be bothered with my questions. She then told me an hour for our food to be ready, which wasn't a problem id just expect it to be warm..not like it was sitting out for two hours. The chicken Parmesan was soggy. The meatballs tasted like a ball of spice. The only thing being close to good was the salad. Incase the owner reads these I'll give you a description of her. She's definitely an older lady, works behind the bar, and reddish brown shoulder length hair. Now back to the disgraceful woman who took our order..when I went to pick up our takeout it got worse. I don't think she realizes when she huffs, puffs, and makes nasty faces at customers they can see her. She answered the phone and someone had asked her a question and alls she said was \"no\" and hung up the phone and then rolled her eyes. She didn't even offer to get me a drink while I waited for my cold food and ignored me so I couldn't order one. 15 minutes later our food came out and I politely asked for more salad dressing and she just looked at me and turned around. Like who does that?! Have some manners! We NEVER not tip but I seriously couldn't give this lady a dime. She ruined our experience there and we definitely will not be back which is a shame since we are locals and love getting take out on busy nights. I suggest if you're eating at this establishment stay away from takeout and the bar. You'll be treated like dirt and your food will be cold."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in an old strip mall (very small) on Electric Blvd very close to Lake Erie. Right around the corner from Close Quarters, which I have already reviewed.

An Italian restaurant, the menu is extensive and the food above average. Even with reservations you are likely to wait, but there is a small bar which makes the wait fairly pleasant.

As I said, the menu is extensive and predictable. The wait staff is good but the noise level in the one dining room can get a little overwhelming at times. Portions are large so you can expect to take something home.

A good choice for a meal if you do not want to drive into the city and quite agreeable to my wife and I as it was only about 3 miles from our house. someplace to try if you are out and about on the west side."}
{"text":"We love fratellos!!! The menu is what you would expect from local Cleveland Italian. There is something for everyone and it's always served hot. This food is above average Italian, especially the signature Fratellos dishes. There is a great wine list if you know and love wines, and also some easy going by the glass options as well. Service and quality will not be compromised here."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food in a small, intimate setting. If you live in Avon Lake area, this is the place for good Italian food that is consistently good.   The food here is comfort on a plate. The house salad is full of yummy black olives and house dressing is surprisingly good"}
