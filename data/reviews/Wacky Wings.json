{"text":"100+ flavours. That's enough for review.

I chose the hottest one and had to sign a waiver form.

Waiters are very friendly and the atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"Wings are great, excellent selection of flavours. Service was not too good, wait time is long especially after the first  batch of wings. But overall pretty enjoyable experience if you don't mind waiting at times!"}
{"text":"Wacky Wings, how do I loathe thee, let me count the ways? In case you are the owner of Wacky Wings, \"loathe\" means \"hate.\" Then again, I can't imagine that the person who runs this place knows how to read. This is someone who, when asked to describe wings, picked the word \"wacky.\" 
Well, what's wrong with this place? Well, the room is a full on assault on your senses: led palm trees, taxidermied poultry, and 90s music videos. You could bottle the tacky here and sell it at Shoppers next to Jessica Simpson's newest fragrance. Do you miss Matchbox 20? Don't worry, this place is paying them plenty of royalties. I feel like my worst enemy in grade school is forcing me to listen to her _Now That's What I Call Music_ collection. Every piece of decor here seems placed to remind you of dead chickens or Chernobyl. Or dead chickens in Chernobyl. Playing pool here is mostly an exercise in trying not to step on other players and swearing at the oddly built tables. Most annoyingly, this place is saturated with a heavy dose of good old-fashioned, witless sexism (see picture, clever right?). 

The waitresses try their best, but this place is so poorly run that I can't imagine working here is a lot of fun. Good luck finding a server if you are in the pool area; they have some strange \"you can't order drinks at the bar\" policy which leaves you hunting down the last person who acknowledged your existence. 

All of this \"atmosphere\" makes me want to barf. And that's before you order the food. Even the picture of the chicken on the menu kind of looks like tiny pigs screaming for freedom. The fluorescent tinge that dominates the room seems somehow to be mixed into meals. I know what neon tastes like now, and it is not good my friends.
So if you are a sexist whose taste buds have melted off from a meth accident, I guess this place would be OK for you."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you are looking to watch a sports event just because of the price and the amount of TVs there are available in the bar and the personal dining area. They have pool tables and a mini game section.

The service is pretty good too. The food takes quite a bit of time to come out on busy days but that is expected.

They have an all you can eat Wednesday special which is a pretty decent deal for those who can eat a lot of wings. I personally cannot but even then its not a bad deal. You get 20 pieces of wings and fries and you can order more after you are done with your current serving.

The wings vary from good to bad. They have plenty of flavours so its understandable that there will be plenty of flavours you  might not enjoy and plenty that you might. That being said, they are definitely not the best wings around but the variety alone makes up for it in my opinion. Their fries are really good also.

I would recommend this restaurant for those looking to watch a sporting event however if you are looking for quality wings, try again."}
{"text":"The most horrible wings I've had in my life. I felt like I was biting right into oil. It was disgusting. The flavours were also not the greatest. They need to step it up.  I will never come here again for wings. But the place itself has a nice setting."}
{"text":"Beer was ok. The wings were definitely fresh but missed the mark.  I expected better wings from a Wing place. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Even by the low standards of sports bars and wing joints, Wacky Wings reaches impressive depths. I love to grab some greasy food and watch a game as much as the next person, but, people, we must demand better! We must have some self respect!

The neverending, oppressive blaring of music videos from days that are best forgotten; the stale, unmoving air; the fluorescent lights and windowless walls; this is an ambiance with a maximum dose of around an hour. The food is gruel. The beer selection is the same old garbage. A shot of Jameson will set you back $10.75. The servers gamely do their best, but the deck seems stacked against them by poor processes and general confusion, and so it is likely you will not even receive your expensive and mildly gross order in a timely fashion.

There is one piece of good news amid the horrors: the pool tables are plentiful and in excellent condition. They are oddly packed in, without enough clearance between tables, but otherwise things are not too bad! It's just a shame that they have to be contained within this depressing testament to just how much unpleasantness we, as a people, will endure for the privilege of a plate of mediocre wings and a light beer. 

Feel free to take this review with a grain of salt. This place is often crowded, and many of the customers seem to be having a good time. All I can offer is my personal experience: I have had to go to Wacky Wings a few times in my life, and every time I leave feeling tired, sad, and mildly ill. There are good ways to do wings, beer, and the big game. This is not on that list."}
{"text":"Had to wait one hour for our table and then another twenty minutes for our food.. Ridiculous wait.. And our drinks came half full, really disappointed"}
{"text":"Who loves some Wacky Wings? I do over here!! 

This isn't my first time here as I have been here multiple times with family and friends.  Since today, I came here just to celebrate one of my cousin's birthday, I believe it's time to drop a review! 

Starting with the service, I got to agree with previous reviews about the horrible service they provide to the guests.  Most of the waiters are pretty much never present when needed and when they appear, they are pretty hesitant.    I haven't actually had a 'great' service from the 5-6 times which I have came before.  

However, although the service lacks, the food is amazing with bold and tasty flavours!  The long line ups each night shows how busy this place is. Every time I come here, I will always order the Honey Garlic Chicken Wings and will never get bored of it, even if I got another order!  The size of the wings are not small wings, so for what you're paying is pretty worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Went there thinking we could grab a quick meals... it wasn't a game night or event night so assumed it would be fairly quiet.  Got there, asked how long the wait was - was told 45-60 minutes.  Half of the restaurant was empty, lots of empty tables and booths.  Asked if we could sit in one of them empty ones and we were told no, we cannot seat you for at least 45 minutes.  We asked why and the hostess said just because without a particular reason.  Doesn't make sense.  Will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Writing this as a vegetarian:

Place is nice and has a good selection of veggie items on the menu. Been here a few times. If you like hot sauce, it's nice they let you put pay a little extra and try a few.

Their veggie burger is good,and their apps are good too. The people I went with who ate their chicken liked it as well."}
{"text":"It's pretty far from where i live but if im ever in the area on a Wednesday I will come again!

On wednesdays they have all you can eat wings, starting with 15 wings ($17 after you buy a drink- which isn't refillable.. :S)

then after your first 15 wings they give you in intervals of 5 wings.

The service was alright, not the best. The wings were huge and saucy! What sucks is that you can only get one flavour for the night, but that's ok

Overall it's great on wednesday when im having huge wings craving

p.s this place is jammed pack with highschool kids 

3.5/5"}
{"text":"I don't normally go for wings but my boyfriend loves this stuff ! WINGS, GAMES ON THE TV, BEERS, LOUD NESS!! YAY ! lol, I was a tad hesitant to go but once I got there I was pleased with the food, it was good, you get what you pay for, the staff was alright, we had a big party but no one came to check up on us which was odd to me, because we needed a lot of refills and napkins, someone only came when we had to send someone to get a server for our bill. I do not like the décor, very farm-y. but I guess that's what you get when you go to a wings place / sports bar / man cave theme place. I liked the atmosphere, made me feel pumped up even though I don't watch any sports haha, I would come back here again but I would not recommend it to anyone.

service = 0/5
food = 3/5
cleanliness = 4/5
atmosphere=5/5"}
{"text":"I was hungry for wings and wanted a good atmosphere to hang out with friends. I was impressed by the restuarant's setup, especially the bar section where me and my friends sat in. Good selection of beer options and the menu provided a great variety of wing flavours to try. The restaurant also doubles as a pool hall. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night to catch the football game.  It was my first time here and I was quite impressed with the layout of the restaurant. 

The service itself was somewhat dissatisfying. No server came to greet us for a good 15min and it wasn't until we flagged someone down that they realized we were there.  Then apparently the server inputted our order at the wrong table. 

The wings itself was delicious. Compare to other places like wind wings and all stars,  they were probably the most meaty ones I've had. The sweet potato fries were mediocre so I wouldn't get them again

Overall the food was good so I wouldn't mind going again on a game night. But if you want steller service,  well this isn't the place to go to."}
{"text":"This place has become, in the last while, our group of friends' favourite eatery to frequent. The service is great and the food is to die for! The specialty poutines are delicious and with over 100 wing flavours there is so much to choose from! I usually get the Wing Platter where you get 20 wings and get to choose 4 different flavours at 5 wings a flavour.

The atmosphere is fantastic especially on a Leaf night or a UFC night, the energy in the massive bar area is just electric. The only downside is once the game or fight is over the DJ begins the music and it's usually just a bit too loud, almost like you're in a club.

There are tons of pool tables and a bunch of different arcade games to be played on by your kids or even for you and your date. Overall this place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Saw the plastic chickens in the window and was like, \"Whaaa????\" So we went in and ate.  Had no clue it was so huge in there-there's a huge bar, and a huge pool table area and even a video game area too.  

The menu=Wild Wings menu the 100 flavours etc.  We were so convinced we even asked the waitress if they were owned by Wild Wings.  The waitress said no - in no ways were they affiliated with Wild Wings.  

Anyhoo-after we ordered the waitress told us our meal would take at least 30 mins because the kitchen was behind.  Ended up being more like 45 minutes, but they were really packed.  

ASIDE:  My hubby was mad that he married me that night because I hate beer.  You see, all the other tables had this huge beer dispenser thingie that looked like fun-but of course party time Angela that night decided on a Shirley Temple instead. :p 

Overall, the wings were pretty good, sauced and spiced pretty true to description.  The size of the wing itself seemed quite large, and after 5 of them I was pretty full.  (Weak, I know, but after 2 Shirley Temples waiting for 45 minutes-you get the picture).  

Probably wouldn't go back because of the wait.  But I can definitely see groups of people going there for wings/beer/pool for a Friday night or something when you've got lots of time to linger."}
{"text":"Formerly was Woodie Wood Chucks (I believe?), walking into the restaurant you wouldn't recognize. 

We were seated right away and our orders were taken however it took about 45 minutes to receive our food. But  we saw some of the workers just chatting right next to us.We could even hear there staff 'meeting' and how some of the employees will be let go... well I could name a few. 

We ordered the platter which included Mild, Sweet & Spicy Thai ( I think?), Honey and the hottest they got. Managed to get through the 5 hot ones without any issues. All the wings were good however the fries not the best.. not compared to Wild Wings.

Finished up and paid.. and headed over to play some pool.  It was good until it took about 20 minutes just to pay for a 45 minute game. We were sent from the hostess back to the bar about 3 times each.

I'll be back, maybe it was just a bad night? Give it another try. Maybe it will change the star rating.

I did like that each booth had its own flat screen."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it a zero stars...awful food and even though it looks like there is tons of staff everywhere, good luck getting anyone to pay attention....if you want real wings go down the street to Texas Longhorn. $0.65 each on Mondays and Wednesdays. Do the math, that's 25 wings for the same price as the all you can eat scam here. Here you can only order 6 at a time and they have to all be the same flavor. It took so long to get wings that we gave up after 12. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Food- good
Service- not so good
Overall- ok

Could be better, could be worse its good for groups but nothing more"}
{"text":"We returned to Wacky wings after saying we wouldn't go back...

if you want a fun place to have your birthday, this place is cool.. we've only gone here to celebrate someones birthday we wouldn't go here to just have dinner.. both parties we have gone to have had a separate little party area which is nice because its private ..so this place is one star.

i liked our waiter, she remembered my name all night while serving us however i heard a lot complaints from the other people in our group. such as no forks and knifes, meals taking forever to get out ( they ended up just canceling their order) bringing out fish and taking 40 min to bring tartar sauce... the food is gross. and even worse..expensive. our son got a kids meal..7.99$ and says comes with dessert , a choice of mac and cheese or mini burger ...few choices and a drink and a toy..we got mac and cheese ..disgusting, i felt bad letting my son eat that garbage for dinner. looked like no name KD made poorly..the noodles were clumped together cheese in clumps..just gross..came with side of sweet potato fries, and by side i mean 5 fries...the dessert theres no choice unless you pay extra ..its a pre packaged cookie in a bag..again gross.. then for the toy we literally asked the waitress 4 times for our son to get his toy and she said on the way out he can pick one out of a chest..instead of bringing us the chest..anyways..on our way out we asked again can he pick his toy? the response we got was \"its in the back of restaurant near the kitchen\" so now we have our one year old all packed up and we have to mission back threw a busy bar..no thanks forget it.

we had wings, a boneless chicken wing meal ( with a garden salad) and a kids meal , a beer, and a cocktail..70$.. the food was actually gross. wings dry.

totally NOT worth 70$. everything taste frozen from a bag deep fried. no taste. dry. bland. barely warm. 

the little private area you get for a party is fun but thats the only good thing."}
{"text":"Interesting to see other Yelpers with similar experiences to ours. When we walked in we got a pool table right away, but it took us fifteen minutes for someone to take my beer order, and twenty five minutes before I got my beer. That's only because I walked up and found her chatting to a customer with my beer in her hand (close to her face might I add. Girl, do you have any idea how much invisible spit must have gone into my drink by the time I got it?). Also by the time I got my beer it had no head on it--criminal. 

Even after having to come find her to get my beer the first time, she NEVER returned to see if I wanted another drink. I also barely saw another server after that so I just went to the bar myself. She also never returned to see if we wanted food, even though we had asked for menus. Idiot. I can't believe my boyfriend tipped her.

After that, we went and sat at a table. After five minutes with no service we were going to leave and eat somewhere else, but we managed to get a server who was really good/quick and that made the experience a touch more positive. (Blonde girl, smart and friendly.) 

Management was either off that night, or they need to seriously kick some ass, if mine is not the only comment on here about the disastrously non-existent service.

Our food was crappy too but I blame ourselves 'cause we made the mistake of getting three fried things on the appetizer platter. Next time will definitely try the wings the place is known for. 

Meanwhile, love the decor and pool tables. Love the atmosphere too. And decent prices. I would love to make this place a regular date night venue for us and come back, eat wings, play pool, and the beer is really nice and cold! But judging by our own experience of the appalling service as well as the remarks I've read here, I'm hesitant."}
{"text":"Go-to spot for wings and to catch the game. Atmosphere is country-sportsbar with lots of big screen tvs, booths with TVs and a large section for arcade games and pool. Wacky wings is fun for the whole family. Food is always good too...regular pub fare, lots of fried stuff but of course that's to be expected. Wackys loses a star for me solely because out of the 5-6 times I've been there service has been so-so and never consistent. I've had visits there where the service was quick and amazing and then other times when our table was forgotten for 15 mins after we sat down. Nevertheless, usually a fun time!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside (lit up palm tree) and looks particularly small.. but it was recommended to me by a family member and a group of us went. 
This place is amazing, the size and layout is fantastic! Looks are deceiving as it's completely different when you walk in! It's HUGE! We sat up near the bar and there are screens everywhere yet it's not overpowering; it won't drown you out trying to talk! There is a massive screen behind the bar too or projector screen (can't remember) ..
I ordered fish tacos and garlic Parmesan fries which are both amazing but regular fries would have done, I was just being a glutton (and trying it was worth it).. 
There is also an arcade machine section and down below the bar there's a ton of pool tables!! You Can reserve the bigger ones or just do loonies on the smaller ones! 
I think they would do well with groups so we will be going back next month for an event!
Ps. Tacky tree transformed to Amazing tree at night when we left"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday and the restaurant isnt busy for a noght with a Mayweather boxing match happening. Ive seen bars packed compared to this and had better service. 

Our waitress took 30 mins to take our food order after receiving our drinks. 

My bf and I order 1 cheeseburger with fries and sampler platter of wings. The fries and wings came and the burger never showed up....

The waitress never checked on us or refill the drinks (iced tea and cocktails). When we complained to the manager he went to the waitress asked her what happened and she said we were lying. 

We asked her to explain how we got fries and no burger? No response.

Finally the manager  (Donaven) agreed to comp the food but we pay for the drinks. Fine.

20 minutes later we were still waiting for the check...

After 40 minutes we finally got it needless to say no tip was given for poor service. I hate not giving a tip but Im not going to pay for crappy service ever!

I will never be coming to this place ever and I will make sure none of my friends come here either."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite wing places to go to. The place is huge! It's definitely a sports bar. They got alcohol, hot waitresses, and a humongous theatre screen TV at the bar. There's also music playing in the background ranging from old school to Top 40. You can also play pool here and they also do reservations for big groups!

For me, the quality and quantity of the wings are just like any other wing place. Basically $10+ for a pound of wings or combo. Wacky Wings definitely has more variety of flavours to try from compared to other wing places. It's a great place to go eat wings and drink beer with your buddies because of the lively atmosphere. Also a great place to go watch big sporting events!"}
{"text":"Stumbled this place at 1 am while finding ourselves famished. Service was super friendly, space is open and fun, accessories and decor just made me feel like a kid at McDonald's . Wings-best I've ever had. I happen to be a wing frequenter."}
{"text":"Don't go during a big sports game. They told us they had no menus left,  we had to write our orders and bring it to the front.  Waited for an hour,  no waitress has come by.  No food, no drinks. Would have thought if we made reservations, they would plan better and have enough staff. Guess we are leaving without food or drinks."}

Before reading this review please play one of the following tunes on YouTube for effect while reading....

Well done WW, you bested me last night, bested me at my own game and tested my tummy.  

Devils inferno was your game and you certainly brought \"the heat.\"

I've never eaten something that so immediately brought tears to my eyes and made me yearn for a quick death more. Bravo. 

Devils Inferno is not something to be trifled with... Trust me its the next morning and it is now trifling with me in an ungodly way. 

Despite gruellingly slow service last night (due to AYCE wing night and a Leaf game), I'm giving you a fifth star for your performance in the \"scorch Kris so bad he'd rather cut off his tongue, douse himself in gasoline, light himself on fire an get kicked in balls by a satanic mule\" category. 

Glory glory what a helluva way to die...."}
{"text":"Wacky Wings is hugeeee!! I was amazed when I walked in.  The atmosphere is amazing for any sporting event as they have tons of TV and a huge one in the bar area.  They have pool area and games from Playdium as well.  They were always having a mini hockey tournament and giving away free prizes, mostly from the beer companies.

The food itself - the wings were okay. Smaller in size to most wings places and the flavors doesn't stand out too much to me as most were bland and uninteresting.  The spice level is low unless you order the super hot ones.  I can't eat food that spicy but even I was ashamed that they called some of them spicy as I didn't even get a kick from it.  Like there was no spice at all.  

Service is pretty bad. Took us a while to get out order taken and took us another 30 mins to get all out bills and for her to process the credit cards as she keep leaving so we had to wait 2-3 mins each time for her to come back to process the next payment."}
{"text":"This is not a review on the food here. The food is average and if you expect hot wings, you will be disappointed. However this is a review on the manager. I find it hard to fathom a manager approaching someone sitting in the bar area watching a football game if they are expecting more people to come. I've been to several other sports bars and sat in the bar area for the duration of a game, and not once has anyone ever approached me pressuring me to either have others join me or leave. Then signing up for their VIP program I received a 15% off coupon. When my server approached this gentleman with it, he said to tell me to make sure I delete it immediately cuz he didn't want me using it again. I can see why there were seats available at this sports bar for the games. My seat will forever remain empty at this locale, as I will never give them another penny of my hard earned money to be disrespected like I was yesterday afternoon."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wrap found it salty but meh it's bar. The service really sucked, my friend had to wait almost 20mins for the second batch of wings. You only get 5 after the first 15 :/ we constantly had to get up and get her attention or put an order or request a drink with another server. I would give the food a 7 and the service a 4. The waitress was super nice but the overall service really sucked. If I ever did come here again it would be with a large group of friends, I wouldn't mind waiting 20 mins for service...I would be socializing anyway. 

The wings are DRY! I love my wings saucy *extra saucy* yum!! And they just drizzle the sauce on the wings...weird :/ well, I'm glad I didn't go here for wings :) 
The place is huge with. Lots of TVs but I come here to eat and get good service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. It's a huge place when you walk in. Lots of big flat screens by the bar. Lots of tables. Even a gaming area and pool tables. 

We tried the sample platter (4 flavours, 5 wings each) and was enough for my boyfriend and I (but we did order a side of fries and mozzarella sticks as an app). Nice to try some of the many flavours they have!

Would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"I want to forget this place exists. Before I do that I will tell you this. You should forget about this place too. I've never seen service so bad on so many levels. Right from the hostess, to the server, right up to the manager... The food couldn't even save the day.  
Wacky wings = Great concept; poor execution."}
{"text":"I came here over 10 times and it's a convenient place to hang out with friends or watch a sports game.

Pros:
- A wide variety of wing flavours (Different sauces, seasonings and spices)
- large location with large TV's for great game day watching
- Wednesdays is All You can Eat and you can try different flavours throughout your stay

Cons:
- All You can Eat Wednesdays are always packed with people and you could be waiting for a table for hours
- Waitresses aren't the most welcoming. I would say I got a good waitress 25% of the time"}
{"text":"Its safe to say that Im a regular here. I love everything about Wackys - food, entertainment, service everything is always on par. Highly recommend the Honey Garlic Gar Par wings, similar to the Sweet Escape from Wild Wings, and the campfire sticks tastes like delicious hot off the grill Churros."}
{"text":"YESSSS!!! YESSS!!!!

I am so happy to know about this place. It is basically the perfect date spot for the Hubster and me: wings, beer, sports on big screens, music (lots of 90s for some reason), pool tables and friendly staff. What's not to love!?

Big thanks to Tim for putting a UYE together, so we could all get all you can eat wings and share them amongst each other.

The rule for AYCE wings is: Wednesday only, $15.99. You get 15 to start with fries and after that, you get wings in batches of 5 with or without fries (which continue to be free). You have to stick with the original flavour you ordered, but if you're with friends, you can trade. If you can't finish your first batch, you can take the rest home. After that, there's no take-homes. 

First off, the wings are pretty huge for AYCE. They're also perfectly cooked and tasty, though I thought the seasonings were on the salty side. I got the spicy thai dry, which were really good. I also got the Megan Fox Hot sauce on the side, which was the second hottest they had, and was like a spicy Frank's Red Hot, but saltier. So... not that hot. I'll have to try the devil's inferno next time. I also tried the habanero Thai, which was very good, and the honey garlic, which was also very good. 

I LOVE the fries.

I will be back, and in greater numbers, too!"}
{"text":"When did woody Woodchuck close down?!

Remember when the only place you could get wings was a bar or pizza joint. 
This changed about a year ago when we got flooded with Wing places.

This is another place with the word \"wing\" in it's name.

This place really loses 2 stars on service
- Slow!!!!
- Unorganized

Went for wings one night, ordered the Sampler with fries.

The fries were OK kind of MC Donald s look and taste.
I tried the Inferno wings or what ever wacky name they call them... All i have to say is EHHH.... they should send some of the staff that is good at standing around to BurritoBoyz to find how HOT! is made. 

We waited for this mediocre food about 45min.... 

They do make a comeback with the restaurants set up 
Food to the right -------
Billiards/Bar to the left -----

They also have a small arcade with tokens you can win.


I will give this place another try with the Billiard/Bar area."}
{"text":"This place is massive. It has an arcade and about 15 pool tables. TV's everywhere. A bar area and dining area. It has huge screens and plenty of parking in the front. There are over 100 flavors of wings and they are a pretty decent size and extremely tasty. I had their 5oz Sirloin Burger with Swiss Cheese and it was absolutely delicious. They serve hot dogs, poutine, wings, and salads etc. 

All you can eat wing nights every Wednesday for $16.99 is a pretty good deal if you are super hungry and craving a wing buffet.  The service here is medicore at best. Do not come here expecting great service....come here for the food and the pool tables. Great place to watch sports in Mississauga area."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed this place before as I've been here at least 8 times in the last two years.  Its more because my wife and kids like this place than me.

So my kids like the kids menu, but moreover the love being able to play the video games and win prizes.  That being said, some of the touchscreen elements on the wheel of fortune machine were not working and my son says he lost out on 50 tickets because the \"L\" was not working when he pressed on it.  The kids love the Mac and Cheese here, so it was a no-brainer for them.

I've had the wings before, which are ok, but merely ok.  I'd put them ahead of Buffalo Wild Wings, but behind Wild Wings.

This trip I had a sandwich.  This is the first time in my life that I've been in a wing place and NOT had wings.  I went for the roast beef dip sandwich, with cactus cut potatoes.  The sandwich and cactus cut showed up fine and were still warm.  The kitchen had forgotten to put the Au Jus and the chipotle for the cactus cut on the plate.  The server got them promptly when I asked.  The sandwich was good, but if you dip every bite of the sandwich you will run out of au jus about two-thirds of the way into the sandwich.

I'll be back, but not on my own volition."}
{"text":"First time coming here, great experience. Came here with my fiancé to play some pool and have a couple beers. The waitress was very helpful and told us it would be wiser to choose the personal pitcher instead of a regular pitcher as it is cheaper in the end. My fiancé and I decided to order the wing player for the $24.99. 

I like spice so I was a bit disappointed that the habanero sauce wasn't spicy and the amount of sauce they had put on the wings did not cover the entirety of the wings. Ate about half of the platter when we came across one really undercooked wing, as you could still see pink and a little blood. The waiter took the wings back and came back with a full order of the wing platter (even though we had already ate half of it); then apologized for the undercooked wing. 

All in all, it was a good experience with good customer service. Definitely will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for some wings. There were many selections of Wings. Salads, and other dishes.

Overall, not very impressed.
The wings came super quick. Not sure if that's a good thing. I think they were pre-cooked, then sauced and heated to order. All wings were kinda chewy."}
{"text":"Their Sweet 'n Spicy Thai & Garlic Parmesan sauce and the cajun fries are the only reason why I come here. Their other sauces are pretty basic. Some of the dry seasonings are okay, but the taste never seems to be consistent so I stick to my one flavour.

They have all you can eat wings on Wednesday nights but you have to order the same flavour every time and the wings take so long to come to your table that you're full by the time they do. The service is alright, never horrible but also never great."}
{"text":"Visited this place over the holidays.  The apps are awesome.  Service was great.  Burger was horrible left a bad taste in my mouth for 3 days.  Probably should have stuck with my guns and ordered wings.  I was with 3 other people and no one else had a complaint.  I have also been there many times just must have been an off day.  I would not cut this place off my list yet"}
{"text":"I guess it really depends on which day and time you visit because I had a wonderful experience here.  

Visited on Good Friday for lunch and it wasn't packed to the tits like other days (like their AYCE Wings on Wednesdays.  

It was cold but sunny so my boyfriend and I sat at the outdoor patio area.  During the heat I am sure this area will be packed.  There's even a tv facing out for everyone on the patio.  They had an amazing selection of classic rock playing.  I would totally come back and sit here til they close at 2AM on a hot summer day and just drink and each their sour cream and onion flavoured onion rings!

We were there not for a pig out this time.

Order:

1 Sour Cream and Onion - Onion Rings
1 Wing sampler (4 flavours of 5 wings each)

Our server was very friendly and seemed very experienced.  Came out to check on us a perfect amount of times without being annoying.

This has the best onion rings all round.  I like them because they are thinner and crispy with a hint of the flavouring.  I wanted to order about 3 baskets of them but then I'd be greedy.  Good portion.

Wing flavours:  Dr Pepper (actually tastes like the pop! - Excellent taste), Lemon Pepper (I love the lemon flavoured salt), Rickards and Blue Cheese.  

I was never a wing person but these are excellently done.  Not tooooo saucy like many places.  

Food came in about 15 mins. In the mean time we were on their wifi which was FREE.  FREE is the key.

If you come for the AYCE option on Wednesday I would come with a group of more than 4 people so you can try more flavours without bending the rules of sharing.  Totally worth the $14.99 plus drink purchase.

I've played at their arcade area.  I love that adults can play there and win tickets to redeem for prizes.  

This place is huge!  I would totally have a party or meeting here.

I can't wait to visit those little plastic chicks and hens again"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday since he LOVES wings. Ordered 100 wings amongst 4 people, took a bunch home since we couldn't finish. The waitress we had was awesome. She was quick to order our drinks and food when we were ready. She was great at connecting with her customers and didn't make it seem hard or awkward at all. Overall, food was fresh, affordable, came out fairly quick. Because of her amazing customer service she got a great tip and a phone number too lol. First experience was definitely a 5/5 stars. 

Went for the second time, this time for dinner since I had just gotten off work the day after black Friday. Was busy but the wait time was short. We got seated in less than 5 minutes, ordered our drinks and food. This service we had was pretty good, understood the words that we ordered but not actually getting it right. We aren't picky customers so we didn't care that much. We enjoyed our meal even if it was very busy. Busy or not, servers were quick and so were the food. But because of the misunderstanding of our orders, the second visit was a 3.5/5 starts. 

Overall, this is definitely my place for wings! Love it here!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a UFC night of Feb. Everything was busy and 90% of the tables were already packed at 11pm. We waited 2 mins, before a table was cleared. The waitress arrived within 5 mins, she was friendly and took her time to explain things on such a busy night. This was my first time here as well. We ordered a 80oz pitcher. I really recommend this on a busy night... The waitress didnt have to come back and we didnt have to wait for drinks. It was only my boyfriend and I, the 80oz was 3 pints exactly. We got a sample platter, 4 choices of 5 wings. The signature meduim was my least fav, top favs were meduim bbq, meduim thai, and honey garlic. The waitress checked up on us a good amount of times. All the pool tables were taken so I cant comment on the game section but it was big!

The service was great, they have wetnaps, paper roll, salt&pepper on every table. TVs every side of each section... A lot of them!
The staff was friendly, food came out quick (and it was very busy). 

I would come back here out of all the wing places, I've been to. The staff was good, food is top notch. I prefer this over WW."}
{"text":"This is a good place to hang out on weekend. Lots of pool tables. I saw blue jays game here and was fun. Food as well is good. Bacon broccoli cheddar bites appetizer are just amazing! Chicken wings are good with ranch flavour is the favourite. Just i thought the server was not that good in terms of understanding our order. Made few mistakes before getting it right. Otherwise this place is good to hang around on weekends."}
{"text":"I've been a Wacky Wings customer for at least half a decade now. It's a huge space that's split 50/50 between a sports bar and a pool hall. Theres even a mini arcade as well as an overflow dining area with smaller TVs for when it gets extra busy. To give you some sense of scale, this overflow dining area is bigger than most restaurants!

I most frequently come here to play pool, which if it hasn't changed, is half price before 5pm. Last I checked, it was $12/hr, but they may have raised it to $14. Pricey. The layout is good though - the lighting is perfect, and the table spacing is adequate enough that you won't be hitting other people. Each table has some sort of seating - either at a table or a countertop so that you can chill and watch the numerous TVs and even have a meal. They have full waiter service in the pool section.

That's the pool side.

I'm less familiar with the sports bar/dining section. I rarely eat here because the times that I did, it was just standard, nondescript bar food. They try to put interesting twists on items though, which I appreciate. I recently had their loaded wings, which was a set of 8 boneless wings with some toppings, interestingly plated and served on an iron skillet. These were solid in terms of creativity, but overall quality wasn't the greatest. 

Their namesake dish, the wings, are definitely the more popular option here. They have at least 50 flavours, many of which are unique and interesting. Their hottest wing flavour, Devil's Inferno, is one of the hottest wings I've ever tasted in my life. On Wednesdays, they have AYCE night, where you can get AYCE wings for $19 with the purchase of a drink. With the drink, this'll end up being about $25, which is likely more than you'd pay for a night out eating wings anyway... So I'm not sure it's worth it, but regardless, I hear it's packed every week.

Drink wise, they don't serve pitchers. In their place, they serve 80oz towers of beer. These are huge and are good for 5 full pints. Their beers are reasonably priced and are sold in this 80oz format as well as 16oz and 32oz.

The TVs here are a huge draw. They have a massive projector screen surrounded by like 10 TVs on the main wall, and there are TVs scattered everywhere else in the venue. A screen will be within view from every square inch in this building.

Service wise, things are okay. Beers took a little long to arrive considering all they were doing was pouring... But it's not too bad. Food came in a reasonable time. One incident that bothered me is that the first time I ordered Devil's Inferno wings, they served it without tossing them in the sauce. The wings are considerably hotter with the sauce, so we complained and got the sauce on the side. However, had I not been with someone who had already had the flavour before, we would never have known as this was not disclosed to us. Another thing that bothered me is the lag between some of the screens. Watching the TFC playoff game yesterday, some TVs were ahead of others by about a second. I was watching the late TV and noticed when hundreds of people were cheering on a goal before me. So service wise, Wacky Wings is passable but could definitely be improved.

Overall, Wacky Wings is solid in the aspects that are most important. They have screens everywhere, the pool area is fantastic, and the food is good enough. It's no surprise how popular they are for a night out."}
{"text":"Food is fine but a bit on the pricey side.
Service is HORRIBLE! If you're on the pool table side and you do not play in any of their pool leagues, you're lucky if you can even find a server. The area by the front bar is only marginally better. You can see a server but good luck trying to actually getting served.
The only upside is that the wings are good and that whenever you actually DO see a server, most of the time they are pleasant."}
{"text":"So we come here about once a year with our running group for Wednesdays AYCE wings (obviously I do not partake lol) and the venue is great for a large group because it's huge. It does get extremely busy on Wednesdays due to the special however. I think this causes a little issue with the staff, simply because they're probably a bit overwhelmed. I felt that this year they managed us a bit better than before, so kudos for that. It just takes a long time to get the first set of wings and food for everyone. They do a good job of separating the bills which entails good organization skill. 
The reason I have to give a 3 star is because the food for veggies is so sub-par. The cactus cut chips were awesome and I was happy to see the menu changed and added a lot more options for vegetarians. But the veggie burger was a frozen patty, pretty gross, just the Dr Pepper toppings (minus the bacon) saved it. Everyone always seems to really like their wings though and likely that is the reason you're going! So this is more of a forewarning for the vegetarians."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time in over a year and gotta say, if you're specialty is wings...make them right!  I ordered the dill and sweet thai wings and although the sauce wasn't bad, the wings were small and not cooked very well, the chicken was too slimy, no crispness.  Ordered a side of gar par fries and they were basically the same kind of garbage fries KFC uses and they had just some gar par sauce they put on the wings and charge $1.99 extra for them!  Don't think I'm coming back to this place for wings, but my friends burger looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Food took over an hr and when we got it,  the food was cold. We bought appetizers and didn't get them till the food came.  The wings were bland.  I bought the second hottest one and wasn't hot at all. The servers were nice but not efficient."}
{"text":"I've been to wacky wings probably close to 25 times over the past few years. Which is why I never reviewed them previously because every visit is different.

This is the \"go to\" place in Mississauga. It's been described to me as much from multiple friends.
This place was once a Woody Woodchucks so some of the wood decor remains the same. There is a small arcade for the kids and pool tables for the adults.

There's big screens, little screens, beer, sports and the place is huge.
The menu is constantly changing with bigger and better options.

I've had excellent service, mediocre service, and servers that completely ignore us.
The latter hasn't happened in a while.

I like the food here, as I said there's always lot's to choose from. However I hate it when they discontinue items I really enjoy from the menu.

Overall this place is pretty decent, it's great place to catch up with friends, enjoy some wings and have a nice night out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to goto for Wings! This place is absolutely massive. Great atmosphere, pool tables, large flat screens, friendly and attentive staff and huge selection of wings. Better than Wild wing for sure."}
{"text":"I love wacky wings we have a tendency to only come here on Wednesday due to their all you can eat special. I was here just this past Wednesday and had a great time as per usual. We easily found parking (although it wasn't necessarily close but this allowed us to burn off some calories haha ) we were promptly seated and had a great server named Adam. He was really friendly checked on us frequently and always made sure our drinks and wings were topped up. Over the years wacky wings has really evolved for the better. Originally you had to buy a drink to get the all you can eat combo and we're only able to eat one flavour. Now they allow you to switch your flavour throughout the night. This provides you with a great opportunity to taste everything wacky wings has to offer. While we were here on Wednesday my party had requested that one of the many tvs played the TFC game. Our server Adam was great as he talked to both of his managers and made it happen. We were thrilled we were able to eat our food with some great entertainment. The price is crazy cheap too! You start with 1 lb of wings and fries and every refill of wings after is 1/2 pound for a mere $21. What's great is if your not eating all you can eat the rest of the table is still allowed to do so unlike some other wing joints in the GTA. The conveniently located wings joint is a must try if you haven't done so already !!!!"}
{"text":"Been a loonnng customer.. Never been disappinted with service or food, great ambience and crowd."}
{"text":"Don't go on ayce night. Not worth the wait. Terrible customer service.

If you love spicy, try \"devil's inferno\". In fact go with cluster of friends and make each person try. You'll laugh at and with who can handle it. Personally it was just okay. If you want real spicy wings, I'd recommend you going to Duff's or Wingporium."}
{"text":"Best wings of all time and they have 100 types of sauces you can try and good service and then that have a pool table and tv for like games and great place for party's !! 10\10"}
{"text":"@WACKYWINGS #YELPGTA #CHICKENWINGS #AYCEWINGS

Surprised that I haven't reviewed this place. I've been here a few times already. The interiors, although a tad tacky with the lit up palm tree and pseudo \"hunter\" furnishing, is actually quite nice. I took the Dad and he was pretty impressed. It may have been the 10+ tv screens at the bar. I was always pretty impressed with the personal TV in the dining booths. Whether I watch sports or not, it's a nice/fun to have thing. That said, this place is perfect for the big game. And always packed during one! 

I've always liked the wings here - even though Wild Wing is my current favourite. Wacky Wings has a great Honey Garlic and Buttermilk (possibly my favourite flavour). Dad tried the Spicy Garlic and his review was \"very good.\" The price is reasonable too, comparable to the other Wings places. 

Now, Wacky Wings is the only place that does AYCE Wings. Other than Hooters. But this girl ain't that trashy. The catch with AYCE here? You only get to order one flavour. How many of the same saucy wings can a girl eat? About 10. 

So, that brings me to my famous Ankie Tip: Take friends. Go in groups of 6-10 people. That way you get to share.

Sadly, for me, I only do mild. And everyone I know like medium or spicy. So that sharing thing isn't happening. 

Lastly, Margarita (Wackyrita, as they call it) rating: 6/5.
SO GOOD. 

I want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I really think this restaurant is awesome - super clean and great atmosphere!  The wings are world class - thoroughly cooked and an enormous selection of sauces.  I wanted to try the boneless Devil's Inferno (where you sign the waiver) but the waitress talked me out of it and suggested Meghan Fox Hot.  It was like suicide but I think it would have been hotter if it was on regular bone-in wings so I'm still curious about this Devil's Inferno.  We also tried the chili lime and it was soooo good!  My husband ordered poutine, which wouldn't be my number one choice but it extremely tasty.  Beer was also nice and cold!

Lots of TVs with various games on and a you can buy tickets to play all sorts of games.  The tables were super clean (had a roll of paper towel and a bucket to discard bones), really friendly and knowledgeable waitress and people just seemed to be having a really good time.  It's a good place for a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Lots of options for the picky eater or special dieter. Sports bar can get pretty loud. 
Usually, good with friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh wacky wings the pinnacle of sports bars in Mississauga. It has more tv's that you can look at, it has clean and well maintained pool tables and even different arcade games. All together this is the place to be to watch any sporting event or for a night out. I went here with some friend to play some pool and watch the UFC, I was surprised by how well the tables and cue were taken care of. We didn't go for food this time, but from the times I have been here before I recommend going with any of their wing sauce.  I haven't found a bad one yet."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Had to give a licence and credit card to get a pool table (understandable) but didn't see a server for roughly 10 minutes. Once we were finally served, it took another 15 minutes to get our pitcher of beer. Ordered MGD and it was beyond flat :-/ Ordered another pitcher right away (as we knew it would take some time) and decided to switch to Heineken in hopes that it would be fresher... Flat again. 
Didn't think about ordering food seeing as the drink orders had taken waaaaayyyy too long. 

Positives - good fun scene, music was well mixed and lively and the place itself has great potential. Missing professionalism. 

Wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I have tried 100% based on a Yelp Elite's review and boy am I glad I did!  If you like chicken wings you have got to try this place out.  Super large and meaty wings with great drumstick ratio!

I have been to a number of these types of places both in Canada and the USA so knew to expect at least 30 flavour options... they have a ton more than that!  Flavours range from \"no heat\" to \"Inferno\" so there is something for everyone. And you can choose breaded or natural.

I briefly scanned the rest of the menu noting they have an amazing \"build your own salad\" section, burgers and tons of apps but we lucked out and arrived on an \"all you can eat\" (AYCE) night so it was all about the wings.

Some things to note about AYCE night - there are rules:

You get all you can eat of ONE flavour so best to go in a large group so everyone chooses something different.

You also get AYCE fries with your wings - most places dont refill the fries so that's a plus. However if you just want chicken you can opt-out of fries (i did to have more room for wings!).

You DO NOT get AYCE beverages. Normally there are free refills on fountain bevvies but not with the AYCE special - a bit counter-intuitive - bit a rules a rule. 

If its your first time, AYCE might not be the best choice given the single flavour option.  If you order off the regular menu they have tasting platters (multiple flavors allowed) and we will be going back to do this.

So thoughts on the food:

We had Ranch flavour and Honey-Garlic/Garlic Parm.  They were both in the mild category but I would have moved them to the \"no heat\" category. Im not a wimp when it comes to wings but find no two restaurants rate their sauce the same so we played it safe (this time).  Regardless of the heat factor they were tasty - full of flavour - well sauced and served piping hot!.  The first round were breaded, the second round wasn't. I personally prefer no breading but the sauce doesn't cling to the meat as well without it. Its really a personal choice in the end...

The french fries also have some form of coating on them because they are super crispy without being over cooked.  A bit of an onion tang to them - could be the coating or could be made in the same oil as their onion rings. Not sure but I enjoyed them all the same.

Decor is fun and festive - like a big tiki festival. Great for a crowd or football Sunday (lots of TV screens) but also works for couples with their small (for 2) booths.  We will be making this a regular haunt and suggest giving them a try!"}
{"text":"The worst service possible!!! 

The food and the locale are good but the service is atroutous. 

I have been there multiple times, the waitress will come check up on you once an hour if you are lucky.  During all you can eat, she will not come after the first order.  (Even though you want more beer).

Make sure your bills are accurate.  They do sneak in more beers.  I noticed this and complained and the waitress was stubborn and did not want to take it back.  (The bill was in over 100$, why are you argining for 6$). She obviously ended up getting no tip.  

If you go there go for the atmosphere and do not bother bringing extra cash forol the tip, the service is brutal and they do not deserve anything.

Locale: there are about 10 pool tables and multiple arcade games:basketball, shooting games... So it is a good place for both kids and audlts.
They also have a bunch of TV and projectors so good for sports.  They also have a \"DJ\" playing music.  At one point on the TVs there was baseball, hockey, two different music channels and a random TV show.  

Food: their hottest wings require you to sign a weaver.  The weitress spent about half an hour trying to convince us not to get it (likely since she needs to do more work).  We ended up getting 1 pound for 8 ppl.  After everyone had one, they were fine, the wings were not as hot as they all made them seem.

Conclusion: go there if you want to play pool and watch sports, and eat good wings, but be prepared for bad service."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out, play pool, it watch the fight/game. Mind you, on UFC or Game night it's pretty rammed. They have a huge amount of flavors, and they are all pretty good. But if you don't feel like wings, the rest of the menu is quite good too. Also their team pitchers are reason alone to party here."}
{"text":"After being introduced to this more family friend version of hooters a couple years back I had to drop by again to start my holiday gluttony-fest.  Between my bro, my cousin and myself we opted for the 80oz tower of Steam Whistle.  Didn't know if it was just our tolerance/ability to consumption large volumes of alc but the 80oz disappeared sooner than we thought.  The beer had good flavor and went well with the wings.  We had the cajun wings which is my fav and also tried the thai chili and regular hot sauce flavor.  Enjored the vibe and the wings of the place so much that I had to stop by again before I went back to SoCal.  

Upon our return we had a different experience when we were rudely ignored for the first 15min. of being seated.  Apparently,  the waitress in-charge of our table was a noob but that shouldn't be an excuse.  Luckily, Melissa, who was responsible for tables at the opposite end of the restaurant took us under her wing and made up for the neglectfulness.  Melissa saved this place from getting a negative rating from.  To Wacky Wings manager: Promote Melissa!"}
{"text":"Super tasty fun!
The place is massive, and delightfully tacky.
Sports sensory overload with all of the TV's...whenever the NHL gets their act back together, i'll be watching some games from here!

The AYCE night is a great option when you have 5-6 people. You can only order 1 flavour, but are allowed to share.

When I am there on my own, or with one other person, i usually get their sample platter, which gets 4 flavours, 20 wings for $20someodd

But I am in LOVE with teh Dr Pepper flavour! I thought it would be weird, but its actually really good!

For you Yelpers, there will be more UYE events here in 2013! Woooooo!"}
{"text":"Came in for quick pound of wings and I was very disappointed. Soggy over breaded with one of the worst sauces I've ever had. As far ambiance goes The Bedrock Chairs they have are so ugly that I think their designer should be shot. I only gave a second star because it might be a place for a beer and pool."}
{"text":"This place is HOT and the place to be to enjoy good beer, wings and watch sports on big screen TV.  Definitely great to bring friends and family.  Wednesday is all you can eat wings but they're pretty slow on rolling out the wings after you order.  Their sampler platters are not in big portions so skip on those.  Go straight for wings by the pound and fries on the side to maximize your money count.  Their different flavors on wings are on point.  Check this place out"}
{"text":"Great place to go on Wednesday!  All you can eat wings. 
They have a huge option of flavours. Wings are always hot and fresh on Wednesdays. It's always packed. Be ready to wait. 

Avoid going on Sundays for wings. The order I had was cold and soggy. 


P.s sign up for emails. They send you deals and coupons!"}
{"text":"Pool for 6 dollars an hour a table before 5pm.

Pretty empty during those hours so getting a good table will be easy.

There are also a lot of TVs around the pool area so watching FIFA while playing pool of was a big plus."}
{"text":"Always has a place in my heart. 

My ultimate fall back. The variety of flavours for there wings is incomparable! The size of the place is huge. And the service always friendly :) 

What can I say I am a sucker for chicken wings. So if you love wings as much as I do, you gotta try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average. Quality falls short, and indiscernible from places like Wild Wing and Allstar's. Wouldn't bother returning."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.

The AYCE wing night on Wednesdays, while sounds like a good deal, isn't worth the money. The wings are either under-sauced, over-sauced or over-seasoned. And getting consistent wait service is like trying to find Flight 370 at the bottom of the Indian ocean with nothing but a game boy colour.

They'll sneak charges into your bill, so be careful. If you come with a party of more than five they'll automatically add a 15% gratuity fee so beware. When you order a drnk for AYCE wings, make sure you order a juice (like pineapple juice). I ordered a pop which I though would be the cheapest (lets face it; fountain pop costs Wacky Wings pennies to the dollar) but my AYCE pop came up to $3!! My waitress never checked up on us until we were ready to leave so the AYCE pop was beyond pointless.

Their wing orders work like this: they have a few generic wings (breaded, non-breaded), and about 5-6 different types of sauces. When you pick one of their hundreds of flavours, they simply mix different quantities of sauces with the selected type of wing and serve it to you. If you get undersauced wings you'll notice it looks like generic, day-old KFC wings.

The decor is nice; lots of arcade games and TVs to watch while you eat.

The value of this place is pretty low. If you're looking to get a better bang for your buck, head on down to another wing place like Wild Wings where they have consistent service, consistent flavours, and honestly, better wings overall"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after reading about it here. 
I went in for take out, but I would totally go back for a sit down. I love the games area and televisions and good mix of music. It was exciting without feeling hectic.
I had Dr. Pepper BBQ wings and fries, and they were really good. Not as strong of a Dr Pepper taste as I was expecting, but still a good flavor. The fries were soggy but that's probably expected when they're take out. 
I thought the cost was a little high ($13.99 for 1lb & fries) but with that said, I did really enjoy my meal. I sampled the lemon pepper boneless wing and it was good enough to make me want to try them next time!
It's too bad this place is kinda tucked away, hopefully it will stick around."}
{"text":"Not the best wings I have had but it hit the spot when I was craving wings yesterday. Wish I could give it 2.5 stars. Ordered honey garlic, new orleans and applwood smoke flavours. The new orleans and apple wood smoked were very similar. The honey garlic was ok. The atmosphere and decor is fun. Huge TV screens for sports fans. The service was great. 
AYCE wings for $18.99 on Wednesdays. You can order different flavours. Also ask for non breaded otherwise they will bring you breaded. I will be going back for the AYCE wings. I also will go back and check out the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here just to relax and watch some football after hitting the batting cages at playdium. 

We got two wing samplers so we could try 8 flavours. See pics for flavours. The wings were delicious. Megan fox hot has some heat but won't kill you.

There's lots of TVs and a huge projector screen which was pretty clear.

Service was great and helpful. 

Also they have over a dozen pool tables in the back. Two are coin op for $2 which is really good imo.

Overall my experience here was a 5/5. I would def go back."}
{"text":"Very expensive.  
The chicken wings were not cooked properly and it just not worth the hype."}
{"text":"2 stars for food and 1 star for service. Came here with a small crowd to have a good night after work. What resulted was a night of waiting for a 15 minute chow down.

I mean, I read the reviews coming here but one of my friends was a regular so I thought it wouldn't be that bad, but it was pretty freaking bad. Here's how our waiting game went: 40 minutes for the table, 20 minutes to order drinks, 20 minutes to order food, 20 minutes for the food to arrive, 15 mins of eating (yay!), 20 minutes for the bill and machine. 

Also, they were out of half the things we ordered. Okay, I exaggerated, it was like 2 things, but after waiting so long to order it was like the world was ending. No Dr.Pepper BBQ and one of the apps.

As for the food, it was okay, and by okay I mean \"seriously, this is what we get after waiting 2 hours? DON'T EVEN CARE, I'M STARVING RIGHT NOW. CHOMPCHOMP\". 
I got the Korean BBQ x Sweet Chili Thai which was nothing in terms of heat, and I can't really handle my spice, so it really should have been closer to the top of the list. 
The Forty Creek BBQ was okay, it's one of the sweeter BBQ sauces. 
The deep friend mushrooms lived up to the name. 
The dry cajun wings came drenched in the salty cajun seasoning and was almost inedible. I took a bite and my mouth dried up like a desert, the seasoning even gave it a sandy effect. 
The poutines/fries were so not worth the price, as you get a handful of fries and a couple teaspoons of toppings.
The one standout of the table were the deep fried pickles.

Yeah... I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I know I said I wouldn't come here again because of what happened last time, lol.. but I did! Actually I came here twice in the past before without reviewing and No Sign of that rude waitress what so ever!! I'm assuming she got fired, I wouldn't doubt it. Anyway, enough about her! The waitress I had today was a bit somewhat slow at first but picked right up, she was very attentive and Fast! Food came out perfectly and on time! I got the honey medium wings with Gar Par is what they call it, lol, it was good!! I also had a Spanish coffee and the Pink pina colada looking drink and the fried cinnamon sugar looking stick that tasted like funnel cake! I enjoyed it, my friend didn't care for them but I did and I recommend them. The waitress recommend the banana cheese cake but I Love funnel cake and only have it like once every other year and she said if you like funnel cake, you will love these so I went for them.. now I fully recommend this restaurant, I like it."}
{"text":"I probably can eat a whole lb of Devil's Inferno and still smile with my burning lips. 

Aside from Hot and Deathly Spicy wings, there are more to Wacky Wings than wings. A good place to watch a hockey game with your friends as there are so many big screen TVs all around and you won't miss those special moment!

There are also an adult \"play area\" if you want to shoot some pool or play some games.

And if you are really into Wings, of course don't miss the AYCE Wednesday $15.99. But the wait for a table can be painfully long and the wait for additional wings can take forever....100+ flavours to choose from, that's quite impressive! 

Wacky Wings is A-OK place to hang out with your friends. I don't mind going back when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Prices are not cheap but the atmosphere is always friendly and lively and the wing options are great.  A nice place to watch a game and enjoy some great bar food"}
{"text":"Came here today with my co-wokers ('bout 6 of us). It was my first and last time. 

The service was awful. The server gave us attitude for her mistake or the kitchens mistake. They also forgot about another order for one of our co-worker. When we sat down, we ordered the all you can eat wings @ 3PM. They would start you off with 15 wings, and after that, it is in increment of 5 wings. 

You are better off just buying a pound because their all you can eat wings TAKE FOREVER. After the first 15, the next 5 will take maybe half an hour or more; then it'll take another half an hour + before you get your next round of wings. 

I love my wings, but for some reason, the wings at Wacky Wings gave me a headache and upset stomach. It could be that one of their wings they served me was undercooked, but I'll never know.  And I guess that's why they call this place \"Wacky Wings\".

Personally, if you are going in with a party, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Have come  here over the years. Always a positive experience.  
The only thing I have ordered is the Wing Sampler  That is what I will recommend as you can have four different flavours. If you go with four other friends and all  5 of you order  different flavours in your wing sampler that is  a total of   20 different flavours you can try . It will be one wing per person but a foodie adventure. 
I recommend any wings flavour you cannot get elsewhere and if you stick to basic and familiar flavours then you are  wasting your foodie experience . 
They have their wing challenges for customers to try . I tried their Devils Inferno challenge. I  made it halfway before my friend tried to take a picture and i lost my concentration and felt the burn thereby throwing in the towel. :( 
Reservations are very easy to make as long as you call two weeks in advance. I have been able to book tables when bringing groups to watch sports events and always got a good table."}
{"text":"Never seen so many TVs in my whole my life. I felt like Neo in the Matrix. The wings are overrated but this place is still pretty cool to go to for sporting events and to play pool."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my go-to when I'm in the area with friends. Service is always friendly and you get very good portions for what you pay. The wings have many great flavours, and I was surprised more than a few times at loving flavours that sounded super weird (parmesan garlic Dr Pepper? Yeah, sounds weird but it was amazing). If you go on their mailing list hey send you all kinds of coupons, even things like buy a lunch, get one free (during weekdays) or a free appetizer or dessert. The atmosphere and style is very cabiney/woodsy, but in a good way. I love the tables and even the game area. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place was okay, but nothing to write home about. The wings were a little dry and small. For the price of the wings, and that fact that this is a place that specializes in wings , frankly I expected better. We won't be back any time soon.

The time it took to get seated and get our food was reasonable, and our waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"So many flavours to choose from. They have sampler platters with four flavours. Delicious! It's a good place to enjoy, hang-out and eat good food! They have billiards are too!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot since my friends and I enjoyed the food and the pool tables. However, one Monday evening, we had various problems with our food. Our server, Tabs was very helpful and understanding about the problems but when the manager on duty came, she handled the situation very poorly. I told her there was a hair on my breaded wings and she poked around at the food with her hands in front of us claiming it was a chicken hair which is still very disgusting. When I emailed the managers about the situation, they didn't really accommodate us or fix the problem. Bottom line, don't think we're going back there."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the UYE last night I probably would have never stepped foot into Wacky Wings.

Wacky Wings is a huge wings place! Majority of the joint is dedicated to the dining area but they also have an area with many pool tables and even an area with games where you can win tickets. It's kind of like a Dave and Buster's but it's more of a sausage fest lol. There are tons of huge TV's displayed throughout the joint and there were plenty of wing eaters on a Wednesday night.

Wednesday's is their AYCE wings night where you can fill up on as many wings as you like for only $15.99. However, you can only choose one flavour out of their other 100 flavours. It's best to go in a group so that you can try different flavours and share with each other. I had the chance to try the following flavours: honey garlic, spicy garlic parmesan, habanero thai, spicy thai, and buttermilk dill. I enjoyed all of the flavours except the buttermilk dill...not a fan of dairy flavours on chicken.

I gotta say that from all the wing places I've been to this is the best place for wings. The wings weren't small in size and the flavouring were great!"}
{"text":"Used to come here for wings on Wednesdays for all you can eat wings

The food is alright, i like the fries too, but the service is terrible

it's always busy here. The last time we came for takeout was on superbowl night because it was packed, couldn't get a table. They told us it'd be around 30-45 min so we waited. It ended up being ONE AND A HALF HOURS! We kept asking them and they kept telling us 10 more minutes. We saw people that came after us get their food first. It was pretty annoying, since by the time we got our food it was cold too!

Also, the waitresses are REALLY disorganized. Came here 3 times, they gave us the bill, and we didn't even pay and they're like \"Thanks! Come back again!\" They didn't even KNOW we didn't pay! We had call them over and be like... uh we didn't pay yet. The second time AND third time, they did the exact same thing! You would think they can keep track?!?!?"}
{"text":"third time coming around to this wonderful place 
disclaimer: wensdays are all you can eat wings(not boneless) 
upon arriving to the resturant, we were greeted with a swarm of people waiting for seats, we confirmed that we wanted to eat with the resturant and was told we were the 26th group in line. 20 minutes later we had our table (no complaints) 
the food was excellent as always, unfortuantly they decided to change one of the flavors on my favorite wings, which resulted in the wings not being hot enough. 
the place was packed and all of the waitress's were running around like mad because of the amount of people eating and drinking.
overall an excellent time"}
