{"text":"Hey, West Valley! CoolVybz is the place to be if you want to go Jamaican. OMG, you can't get more authentic than CV. From the warm hospitality and Jamaican Pop to the deep and robustly seasoned meats.

All entrees come with rice and peas and pickled cabbage. I love how flavorful the rice is and the cool crunch of the cabbage. 

I ordered the Brown Stew Chicken as recommended by our warm hostess. The stew is slightly spicy with a sweet and savory tang. The bone-in chicken is well marinated and fall off the bone. Watch out for small bony pieces which come with slow cooking with bone-in chicken. They serve up both white and dark meat.

I finished my meal with a side of fried plantain. They were beautifully caramelized. Yum! May I have another order please.

Full of Jamaican clientele, CV serves up nosh that is soul food. Next time, I am getting oxtail and wings. Meanwhile, I am stuffed yet craving another order of plantains."}
{"text":"I just happened to stop here because I was craving some food with some serious flavor and I haven't had Jamaican food in forever. When you first get there you're greeted by the Jamaican flag that let's you know you're in the right spot. When I walked in there were only a couple of customers there, of course since they're a new spot. I just wanted to try the basics to see what they were about so I got a to-go order of curry chicken and I also ordered a beef patty.

I'll be honest, the best thing from my meal was the beef patty. The rice and peas wasn't bad, a little dry but flavorful. I only had a couple pieces of chicken, a thigh and a leg that were extra small, there was no curry sauce, mainly oil and there was no flavor to the cabbage.

Prices were fairly average, ranging between $10-$15. Would I try them again? Maybe, but I think I'll let them get settled in first."}
{"text":"Went today at 11 and doors locked.. no one there...did hours change? Place already shut down? Totally killed my lunch =/"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim at 6 pm.  Because the food is so fresh a lot was sold out but they made oxtail for us to order in a pressure cooker. It was so flavorful and tender. Loved the ginger in it. Worth the wait. The jerk chicken was fantastic too. We got complimentary dirty rice too.  Everyone's super friendly and great old school reggae playing the entire time. Thanks for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken and curry chicken. Fast, friendly service and home made food for a very reasonable price. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice the food is amazing!!! However the staff was not so much. I don't care for people looking at me speaking in another language this can make customers very uncomfortable..... Wish you all the best and much success. I won't return I will takey  elsewhere get my Jamaican fix a few miles up the road."}
{"text":"Love it! The patties were the bomb.  Definitely going to be a regular customer here. If they ever add stew peas to the menu I'm moving in!"}
{"text":"The best Jamaican Restaurant in Arizona hands down! I ordered their Jerk chicken plate and couldn't be happier. The chicken fell of the bone, the rice was delicious and the sauce was amazing. My biggest regret was not getting another side of the sauce. If you live in Phoenix you need check this place out! Can't wait to go back and try some of their other plates"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff!  After living in South Florida for many years, and then moving to Phoenix 3 years ago, it reminds me of home! The oxtails are crazy good!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Jamaican restaurant in Phoenix. Not that I really had one before so I'm really glad this one popped up. 

I had a beef patty and jerk wings. The wings were so good I wish I got a dozen. They were grilled so the had great flavor. The beef patty was good too. Perfect size for a smaller meal. 

Next time I'll be getting the oxtail or curry goat as I sampled them off a friend and they were very good. 

Welcome to the neighborhood Cool Vybz :)"}
{"text":"I'm a Caribbean girl and I take my food seriously. This is the spot for Caribbean food in the west valley. The flavors were amazing!  I ordered oxtail and brownstew chicken and it was cooked to perfection. The plantain was also fried to a precise crisp and perfect on the inside.  It's a running joke in the Caribbean community that Jamaican restaurants are always out of various items; usually the items that you are craving. I was disappointed that I ordered a beef patty over the phone and several minutes after arriving was told they were all out. The owner/manager was so nice. She personally explained and gave my a note on the reciept for a free one on my next visit (which will be today because everything else was so yummy.) Aside from being cited a 20 minute pick up time that was actually an hour - It was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"In town for business this week had a variety of delicious foods. All of a sudden I realized there was a Jamaican restaurant near my hotel so of course I had to check it out. I ordered the red snapper which was huge came with cabbage, rice and beans. I ordered takeout and I did not phone in my order so I had about a 20 minute wait. It was well worth the wait !  As I was waiting in the relatively small dining area I went to the restroom and it was extremely clean. All I can say is it was delicious and I can't wait to return to Phoenix to visit this restaurant again."}
