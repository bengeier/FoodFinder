{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas!! Thee roll special only $25, always fresh, staff is friendly and knows your name"}
{"text":"Been there twice already. Very nice and attentive waiters, great food, and reasonable prices. Love the atmosphere, and the candies we received after the meal."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome food. Get some sake bombs and that makes everything taste so much better. You also can't beat the service."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with my friend Laura, and had a great experience.  The service was top notch, the food was amazing, and the manager there was extremely friendly.  The menu featured an impressive breadth of pan asian cuisine with a focus on japanese food, and since I love asian food, I'm definitely going back to further explore their menu.  I tried the Kani Nachos, Crazy Jalapeño, Beef Yakisoba, Kimchi fried rice, and for dessert, the tempura fried green tea ice cream--all very good :)"}
{"text":"We love the food and the experience here.  The sushi is fresh and there is great variety for everyone!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different on a regular night?  That you coming off of work or just want to hang out on a weekday, this place will sooth your craving... For two person,  you get: 2 soups, 2 salades and 3 entrées, with your choice of any meat/seafood/poultry selections that are on the menu,  $45.00-$50.00 out the door,  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night. Got seated. Took awhile to be seen by anyone but that is ok no need to fire up a grill for two. Got seated with a party of seven. Great people.  The chef (eddy I think)was great and funny. There were kids in the other party and was very entertaining with them. Food was excellent. I got a three meat option and the old lady got one meat choice one soda and a water for $70. Will be back"}
{"text":"By far the best Hibachi in Vegas. Always come here. Great food. Fun atmosphere. My family loves it!"}
{"text":"Found this hidden Gem on Yelp. So glad I did. The hibachi chef was entertaining and sociable. The hibachi was just as good. Also had sushi. Sushi was good, not excellent, but considering the reasonable price I give it an extra star. The interior decor is much more attractive than the odd tinted windows visible from the exterior. I would recommend this restaurant for a date. Don't forget to checkin on Yelp for free saki!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The food was great!! Our waitress however didn't know the answer to any question we had and instead of trying to find the answer, just kind of shook it off. Great sushi joint though! Definitely worth going. We didn't sit on the hibachi side so will definitely try that next time. We also had mixed drinks from the bar that were pretty good. Worth eating here for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have the best sushi around. The three roll special is great. I always get to go orders. Mary is awesome to talk to at the bar. She is a great bartender. Very friendly and knows her stuff.   This place is very well decorated and they are always busy.   They keep opening new restaurants around the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants & I drive the extra few miles to this one because the waitresses are so nice, and my husband & prefer Eddie to do the Hibachi show. The food is great, from there salad, sushi, fried rice, steak, lobster, drinks, EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming in to Ohjah and was greeted by the manager.  He was incredibly friendly!  We had a hibachi grill to ourselves and our cook was named \"SOB\" and was the best hibachi cook I have ever had.  Delicious food, entertaining and very reasonably priced.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great atmosphere and fun to watch the chef cook! Excellent food... ordered the filet mignon.  Very tasty - best place we ate at while visiting LV."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Decateur location but had a bad experience there last night when they cleared out table before we were done eating.  (left to take the kid to the potty and came back to no food).   She wanted the cooking table again so thankfully they had this location.  This spot is so nice and the service was top notch.  The manager took time at the end to chat with me and when I mentioned how unhappy i was at the other location was very apologetic and gave me his card and offered me his cell number in case i have problems at this location.  I work closer to this one and plan to let all my colleagues know this is the place to go for good food, good service, and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Jack and Mary are the best...They are always accomidating to their customers!!!! Calm under pressure. Eddy is an excellent chef and  very entertaining. ..."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has such a high review but nothing but an ordinary asian restaurant with a lot of menu. We had hibachi dinner, fried rice was too salty, vegetable and steak were very blend. Nothing spectacular like many reviews said. We also had two sushi rolls which were covered with almost taste same sauce. I am not planning to go back."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for Hibachi!! Staff is wonderful, and the food is excellent. I refuse to go anywhere else for hibachi! I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience of my life eating at a restaurant to start off there was a hair in my dish matter-of-fact in all of my guests dishes The waiter had a nasty attitude my cup smelled like dirty dishwater . I ordered some shrimp.  my shrimp was a very fishy it was undercooked it made my stomach turn . The only thing that I would recommend at this restaurant is the fried rice .    I would give it a 2-10 sorry ohjah"}
{"text":"Excellent, best Sushi we've had in Las Vegas. The service was wonderful and the rolls were amazing. I can't believe I've been trying places all over the valley and the strip, while this was so close to Summerlin.   We started with the Fuji Apple and Lychee Sake, which were both fantastic. We also tried the calamari, which was a terrific choice. We did the dinner special, which was a great price for three rolls. The Golden Gate, Pink Lady, and Show Me the Love were really some of the best rolls I've had in Vegas.   Our total bill was $63, which included 3 rolls, an appetizer and 3 drinks. Not bad at all for the quality here. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"excellent service great staffing very prompt click professional coordinate dinner very well accommodating to all parties love the environment thank you"}
{"text":"New place in our neighboorhood so we decided to try it. We love it!! Been there about 4 times since it has open. Tried Habachi and regular table service. Food has been great and overall the service is good too. They have been giving customers $10 gift certificates too. I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Food: I am giving it a one-star not for the hibachi but for their sushi.  I came here with friends and while everyone have gone with the hibachi dinner I decided to get the Chirashi since there are rave reviews about the sushi and I was craving it.  What I got was probably the most disappointing chirashi bowl I have ever gotten.  The slices were a bit too thick to be sashimi let alone it did not taste that fresh.  The sushi rice itself should've been great tasting by flavor and texture.  However, the rice was over mixed with the vinegar and it was packed too tight where it lost the \"fluff\" it should have.  The worse part was giving me the ends of the tomago (egg roll). The ends should NEVER be served especially when the intention was for sashimi or sushi.  I do not know if they were either thinking it was a waste but just from that, the presentation was already a lost before tasting.  Service:  The staff was nice and the cook for the hibachi was entertaining except there was a moment of turn off  when he asked where I was from and NY was apparently not an acceptable answer because I'm Asian."}
{"text":"We rencelty went there when we were on vacation on 3/14/14.  We had the Ohjah boat and it was plenty of food for myself and my husband.  The fish was very fresh.  They have PBR on tap, which was totally loved, and their mixed drinks were very good as well.  We definately will return the next time we are in Vegas.  Our waitstaff was also very attentive, without being overbearing, and didn't rush us after they brough the check."}
{"text":"Coming fron Hawaii we had da best experience with Charlie.. He was funny n can use those tiols like weapons!! Such a great place"}
{"text":"They have very good Steak and Shrimp Hibachi. It is out of this world. The portion is also very good. You can still order the hibachi food without sitting at the hibachi table. The service is always so quick and friendly. My kiddo actually enjoys eating the vegetables that come with the meal because it is so good. I recommend the Ninja for those parents with kids trying to eat well on a budget. It is a good portion but you can only order the Ninja dining in.  It is fine because the ambience of the restaurant is very open and comfortable. So we didn't mind that at all. A must go!  I give this place 5 happy stars!:)"}
{"text":"Love this place, good food, good service. Hubby and I eat here at least 2-3 times a month, it is our new go to Sushi place. The food is good quality at a good price and the service is fast and friendly. Love it. I always tell my friends on this side of town to check it out and those that have have all loved it."}
{"text":"Our go to place for habachi.  I have been here several times with always a positive experience.  The salmon is my personal favorite.  The salad dressing is super tasty.  I like to skip the soup and get 2 salads."}
{"text":"Great place for all your favorites  great family environment and social love sushi bar and entertainment"}
{"text":"I've done Hibachi a few times before, but nothing beats a Las Vegas show.   Phenomenal service from every member of staff. The managers are to be commended for how flawless and friendly the service is. I started to break out my phone to give this place five stars just from our service before we ate.   But then... the food!  One of the best sushi rolls I've ever had is their French Kiss, followed by their Sex On The Beach.   The filet minion and the shrimp are amazing on the grill, and everything was cooked to perfection.   The chef lit our food on fire like it was a work of performance art. He mentioned he had nearly 15 years of doing this, and it showed.   Next time we're in Vegas we are 100% coming back here."}
{"text":"Eddy is a great chef. .he has a good personality and cooks my meat the way  I like it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! When you drive up an park you do not expect hat you walk into, it very elegant and the people are very friendly.  We sat down and they took our drink order right away and brought us onion soup right away. We looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices they were extremely reasonable. When we were done they immediately took our dinner order. We received our salad after our dinner order was taken and the dressing was amazing.   Our chef came to the table and put on a great show while he cooked, he was very friendly and entertaining, he even interacted with the customers at the table, which was fun. The food was cook to perfection, the filet was so tender in melted in your mouth.   This is definitely one place I will visit time and time again, with family and friends for any occasion."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Super friendly staff!!!!! Good prices!!!! Will be back again, glad it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times since they opened.  This is definitely my new favorite place for hibatchi. The prices are very reasonable.  The service is good including the entertaining show. The quality and taste of the food is excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi & Japanese steakhouse in Las Vegas! The prices are great, the food is always fresh and the service is amazing. we love getting the sushi platters to split because they are huge and very affordable ( enough to feed 4!) Celebrated my birthday dinner there last night and I can't complain about a thing. They even brought out a delicious green tea cake with a candle on it and sang happy birthday."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while. Great people, and great value here. Nice flavor and solid portions for the dollar. Mary and Jack treat you right here. And Minja too. I love the combo specials but bring my kids in for hibachi too. I recommend this to my family and friends all the time."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place for large groups!!! They have great food & excellent service! We had my niece's birthday here in april & my moms birthday last night. Jakk was our server both times. He gives the best service. He goes above & beyond!!!"}
{"text":"The great food is a given. But what really made the experience stand out was our hibachi server, Sexy Oriental Boy (I kid you not, that was how he introduced himself). He was hilarious and had everyone cracking up, try getting him if you have the option."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from the San Francisco area and tried this restaurant based on yelp reviews.  It seem to be a \"Japanese Restaurant\", run by Chinese, serving assorted \"Asian dishes\" including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and other Asian types of dishes.  It was okay at best and our experience certainly did not match the raving reviews."}
{"text":"Best hibachi in Las Vegas! We go here all the time- fabulous service and the food is always the best!!"}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere and very reasonable prices.  I almost don't want to post a review because I like it when it's not too crowded ;-)."}
{"text":"So stayin at Linq and me and my wife wanted to try some teppanyaki  and everyone told us to check Benihana out but we check out the reviews and decided to try this place out and to our surprise we got the chef that is funny and entertaining he was juggling fire some people on our table called hi master P he is the best we ever seen so far thank you for the experience."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to dine here for quite a while and we finally went.  I ordered the $28.95 combo of filet (mr)/scallops/shrimp with fried rice. The scallops were cooked perfectly, so much so that next time I'd double up on the scallops and one other item.   The only thing close to a complaint might be the 'assembly line' feel of the experience. Also, the hibachi chef seemed confused about what we all ordered. No biggie in the grand scheme of things.   The soup and salad were both quite good. The drinks were kept full at all times, which is great.   I would definitely dine here again....Probably soon."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The garlic edamame was yummy and all three of our sushi rolls were to die for! (Kamakazi, Volcano, and Show me the love) The staff is very friendly and everyone was doing a great job making sure we were enjoying our meal. The restaurant is decorated nicely with a quiet ambiance and everything was clean. This is definitely our new go to place for date night!!"}
{"text":"Pete was the most amazing server ever!! Went above and beyond for us! We come here all the time and would never go anywhere else! Pete & Serena are the best! :)"}
{"text":"sushi is excellent. other food items are ok.  service is good  .  if you become a regular customer with them , they will call you by first name"}
{"text":"The food and service is the best that I have had at a place like this. Our chef was excellent as well. We had the filet and it was just as good as an expensive steak restaurant. Will def come back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is close to our house, so we tried it last week.  It was soooo good!  My husband ordered the tempura dinner and I ordered spicy shrimp. The soup was flavorful and the salad dressing was so good you could drink it from a straw! The tempura coating was light and crispy and my dish well seasoned. I only wish they served brown rice. The choices were fried or steamed white rice.   We will definitely go back to try their sushi and their hibachi. Nice atmosphere, nice waitresses, and excellent food at very good prices."}
{"text":"I love this place. The portions are perfect and the food is consistently good. The prices are very reasonable, probably the most reasonable I've seen for a habachi style cooking restaurant. The staff is super friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"I am a sushi snob... the only meat I eat is raw fish (my body can't digest cooked meat)... after living in LA for 8 years I got very used to high end sushi at great prices, fantastic Izakaya menus etc ... well moving to Las Vegas made me nervous, especially living in summerlin and not wanting to drive to the strip or pay strip prices for great & fresh sushi. Ohjah made my day. I found it via YELP so its only fair that I spread the love.   Boyfriend and I went in the evening maybe around 9pm, there were only 2 full tables seated in the front and a handful of people at the bar, not sure about people in the back. This normally makes me nervous but I was confident in the food after reading reviews. I ordered one of their sashimi dishes and a variety of sushi and the Lychee Sake - everything was delicious and it was one of those times I wish I had starved myself during the day so I could have tried more! My boyfriend tried a few different rolls and an octopus dish (he said it was a little chewy) and he loved the raw tuna tacos!!   All around great price, great quality and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Eddie is a great chef!   The service is always exceptions!   My advice is to have Eddie \" battle\" another chef!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese fried rice I've ever had. Everything I had there is amazing. Very clean and modern inside. Fen fen and eddy are the best."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere - friendly service. DALE is the best - easy to talk to and makes great sushi! Sat at the bar top and got our food quick. Second time here and it doesn't disappoint ! Check in on Yelp for free Sake!! Yum yum"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! We mostly go for the sushi and we love our sushi chef Thomas! We sit at the sushi bar and Thomas always takes excellent care of us! He will make anything we request even if its not on the menu. We have never had a bad experience here and we have been to other sushi bars to try them but I was disgusted at first site and smell! The service at the sushi bar is always top notch. I'm not sure how it is for dining in or hibachi but if you sit right in from of Thomas at the sushi bar you'll be well taken care of"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great service after being seated. We sat at one of the hibachi tables, and really enjoyed the preparation of our dinner. Choosing from the menu can be a little confusing for first timers, so ask lots of questions. Bar service was a little slow, but it was Saturday evening and they were slammed. The maître de was somewhat abrupt, but again, they were slammed. When seating us, he was not clear on whether we were to follow, or to sit. Overall, a great experience and we will return. Fun place to take your visitors. Price was $$$, but worth it."}
{"text":"We called last minute on a Sunday night and got a reservation for 2 no problem.  Typical Japanese Tepanyaki.  Great service and food.  The show was as expected.  We usually go to Benihana downtown but have had mediocre service and quality of food has gone down hill.  So we are super excited about this small gem.  The food and service is really good and the bill was 1/2 of that at the \"Other\" place."}
{"text":"This place is the Best!!! Starting wi Great service !!!!  I was in seafood heaven!!!!!  The 3 roll special is by far the best deal EVERRRR!!!  And Jerry the manger is just too sweet for words!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Better portions than Benihana. The miso soup isn't anything special. Salad was okay. Ordered hibachi NY strip. Was pretty good. Fried rice was great. The biggest turnoff was the sauces they offered. Neither seafood nor steak sauce were any good. Restaurant should consider adjusting the sauces, if they did then this might be 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Went here once and didn't enjoy it. Our chef was a nice guy but talked about his family problems and made it an awkward environment.  The food didn't have much flavor he didn't add any garlic. We felt so sorry by the end of our meal that we didn't want to let the staff know how awful our meal was because the guy had already been through enough."}
{"text":"This was my third time here and it was excellent yet again. Attentive and friendly servers along with a great show by the chef and of course the food was exquisite!"}
{"text":"We've been here a lot. Mostly non hibachi meals. Service is good and fairly quick. Servers are nice and they remember what you asked... which is rare in Vegas.  Food is tasty and fairly priced. Fine location with lots of parking. Strongly recommend Fried rice and sushi boat. Hibachi dinner is both good and fun. I haven't found any Japanese restaurant in Vegas that is worth to return like ohjah Flamingo. (I tried the other location too but this one is my favorite)"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere- awesome staff!! Had hibachi with 10 friends, our cooks names was S.O.B. & the manager periodically checked in on us to make sure we were having a good time. great humor, yummy food, very entertaining. We had a great time and will definitely be back for more. Oh, and they had a promo for September- free hot/cold house sake, non-stop! We couldn't believe it. Love this location!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. The best way to do teppanyaki without breaking the bank or having to drive down to the strip. We have been here many times for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. I highly recommend Eddy!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the westside. Very friendly, clean, nice atmosphere. Loved the Kamikaze roll and the garlic edamame . The owner, Wang, stopped by every table to see how we liked our food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good Sushi and good service!  been here quite a lot.  I prefer other Sushi restaurants, but this location is conveniently located near the 215."}
{"text":"I'll keep it very simple..you can not go wrong getting here.  Great atmosphere..consistent good food and presentstion.  I always leave satisfied and full..."}
{"text":"My in-laws love coming here because it's nearby, rarely crowded & has good food!   We came in half an hour after the opening time and were seated quickly. I would suggest if you have kids to sit in the little wooden booths because there's a little more privacy & you won't get \"why would you bring children to a restaurant\" stares, LOL!  Here's the breakdown: Shrimp Tempura x2 - Always good. Can't go wrong with it. (5/5)  Veggie Tempura x2 - Also delicious, my favorites are the onion & broccoli. There's also big pieces of winter squash where I would normally see sweet potato, so that's different! But my husband loves it, so that's a brownie point. (5/5)  Beef Udon Soup - My FIL enjoyed it, as well as my daughter. They udon noodles were nice and plump. FIL mentioned there was a LOT of cabbage & the broth didn't have its usually flavor. (4/5)  ** Note: All dinner plates come with soup, salad, & choice of white/brown rice. **  Dinner Side Soup - Wasn't really a fan? I'm more used to a flavorful miso soup on the side. This was just a simple broth. And it wasn't touched most of dinnertime. (2/5)  Dinner Side Sald - I could honestly just eat this by itself. I love the dressing! And it's a light accompaniment to the main courses we were having.  Beef Short Rib - Came on a hot, sizzling plate. Good meat-fat ratio, and it's a BIG portion. The marinade is just enough to taste, but not too much that your hands are dripping with sauce. (5/5)  Salmon Teriyaki - Perfect for the simple, healthy eater. A good serving of grilled salmon with a side of teriyaki sauce. Salmon was lightly seasoned, which isn't a problem since the teriyaki sauce packs a lot of flavor. I also liked how they put the sauce on the side instead of coating the fish. If you're a fancy eater, it might not be your favorite. (5/5)  NY Steak - Similar to the salmon, but with steak. A lot of meat for your money! (5/5)  Service was prompt, and our server was really sweet. The food came out hot & delicious, with a reasonable wait time. Definitely recommend for something classy without paying a ridiculous price."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with family to try out their Hibachi cooking since it's near by.  I've been to other near by Japanese Hibachi style restaurants, but I have to say that Ohjah kicked some butt and is at the top of my list.  The salad dressing was delicious and the entire meal was yummy.  I especially enjoyed the Udon noodles and the fresh vegetables.  I was not a huge fan of their onion soup; it was a bit salty and the breaded onion pieces inside looked like it came from a can of crispy onions.  All and all the service was great and the chef preparing our meal was hilarious and very entertaining.  It is a good size restaurant with a private room for dining.  The decor is nice and it has a great vibe.  I hope this plays sticks around because I will definitely be back to try their sushi bar and other menu items."}
{"text":"NO UNI tonight WOW its 2017 seafood flights to Vegas daily. I guess, I should have called ahead ? The YELP check in special is the same price as the regular menu..Funny!!... I will NOT be coming back for the SUSHI / Super White Tuna aka ONO really ?   Some good news the hot food coming out of the kitchen is pretty good and servers are very nice that is how this review made it to 3 stars.  JKKUHL LLC"}
{"text":"My family as a whole is so disappointed in how far downhill this restaurant has gone...  We used to order from there regularly, a few times a week, due to other options opening in the area we branched out, only to return this evening for a very poor meal. First off my husbands favorite dish, filet fried rice, is apparently no longer offered and has been replaced by sub-par beef, which was a struggle to get down. The hamachi is not as good as it used to be, I used to order like 4 at a time!  The tomago was inedible and the chop sticks left splinters throughout the food. For rice we will stick to Jumping Rice & Rolls from now on and for sushi, the search continues. Sad."}
{"text":"Decent food, clean, funny hibachi chef. They mixed up the orders but in the end the people next to us got free extra calamari, so I guess that's a win. Nothing particularly stellar in terms of taste: hibachi fried rice, filet mignon, calamari, sole. The sole was too salty, did not like. Filet was good"}
{"text":"Never been so disappointed with dining out! We were a party of 12 celebrating a birthday. Good luck with getting a good chef... they could rob you of your food. Unfortunately, we got the worst. Our food portions were very small, such that we each only got 4 instead of 5 scallops, steaks were all cut up pieces, instead of getting a carefully sliced up piece of steak. Fried rice, hardly any egg and garlic. I just don't understand why they would skimp on the flavor and food considering we're a big party and we always love to dine out on so many occasions.  No manager ever came to check on us. Never coming back.  Buyer beware... No consistency."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always an amazing time. The staff makes me feel like home. The food is on point and the chefs are super funny lol. They have a full bar but I love their hot sake. I recommend this restaurant any time as the management is very accommodating for just about any occasion."}
{"text":"Our family just finished our hibachi dinner and my kids asked me to immediately give it a good review. That says a lot because one of my kids is very picky ;) The staff is friendly and the food is yummy and cooked just right. I do wish the salad dressing wasn't mayo based....I love me a good ginger dressing! We also got a free sake just for checking in on yelp! Call ahead for reservations because the hibachi tables get packed. Great dinner on a Sunday evening :)"}
{"text":"Always a great time here. Had Jimmy this time and he was a new act and super funny :) The only thing I would say is, Jimmy, you over cooked our Calamari :( But you were great and so was the service as always. It's now our once a week spot :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the friendliest and all around best sushi/hibachi restaurant in the area. We have tried nearly all the Japanese restaurants in south Summerlin, and while they're all pretty good, Ohjah stands out above the rest.  The dining area is very moody and mature, and even when full, it's easy to speak at the table. The wait-staff are very knowleged in the menu and can quickly recommend choice selections. Not to mention they are all very friendly.  The hibachi is the real show here. Every presentation we've had has been on par or better in terms of performance, and the flavor exceeds that of much pricier venues.  The chefs themselves are inviting and easy to talk to as well.  mentioning pricing, it's very reasonable and cheaper than its competitors in the region. Between me and the Mrs. we spend generally $15-20 less here ordering the same amount elsewhere. Can't beat that.  If you are on the west side of town and are looking for a great experience, look no further than Ohjah."}
{"text":"The sushi roll was great and so was the service. I did find the filet hibachi to be pretty disappointing though. Chewy meat and overcooked vegetables at a time when it was not busy was surprising. I will try it again and see if it's just a fluke."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Management was incredibly friendly, service on point and delicious food. Our hibachi cook was named SOB - he was funny and entertaining! Def recommend :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place.  I came here with my parents and brother.  We used the yelp check-in to get a free small apple flavored sake.  Although I've never been a huge sake fan, I was curious.  It was decent.  We did have to remind the waitress that we order this, as she forgot.  We weren't extremely hungry so we shared two combinations.  We were able to choose 3 main items for each combo (filet mignon, chicken, shrimp). We chose 4 filet mignon and 2 chicken.  We also got noodles, fried rice, and veggies.  As you may know, here they cook in front of you.  Our cook was awesome!! Super personable and funny.  They not only cook in front of you but also put on a show.  They throw ingredients in the air, juggle them, make music with them, etc.  We asked our cook to make our filet the way he likes it.  I don't remember exactly what he did but I remember he cooked it with a bit of apple sauce.  It came out to a medium-ish temp and it was absolutely delicious!!  Everything came out perfect.  He even divided everything for the four of us.  At the end, our cook cut up a piece of shrimp and told us we would be catching it with our mouths.  Lol such a fun experience!   For dessert I had strawberry mochi which was delicious as always.  My brother ordered the tempura ice cream, which I didn't care for.  Usually I like this dessert but the batter was very soft.  We threw our cook a $10 tip.. Not sure if they get tipped out.  I hope they do, as honestly they do more work than the waitress.  Loved this place and can't wait to return :)"}
{"text":"So surprising how amazing the food is here. This is the first time I have given 5 stars, and Ohjah truly deserves it. An unassuming location and building opens up to a truly wonderful experience.  Sushi rolls are delicious and well balanced mix of flavor, texture and rice, entrees flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my coming home from deployment. My whole family loved it! Not that we haven't been to a Hibachi restaurant before but we really just love everything about the place.   The cocktails were pretty good. The servers were pretty fast and attentive. Our cook was funny.He pretty much told us his whole entire life while he was flipping them shrimps for my friend rice. LOL  The food were a little on the expensive side. But honestly we didnt mind because it was just a pleasant experience.  Why 4 stars? The food was a little greasy on salty. Easy on both oil and salt please. :)"}
{"text":"I took my friend and her son on a Sunday night. It wasn't very busy at all and the service from the start was exceptional. We were sat down with 3 other dudes and our chef Charlie (I think his name was) was very entertaining and precise. After it was all said and done we absolutely loved the salmon and the calamari,  the scallops were meh and the steak I can make at home. Stick to the chicken , salmon , calamari & fried rice in my opinion. I do very much recommend this place if you are craving habachi..."}
{"text":"Came to this location, with some family, to celebrate my uncle's birthday. This was one of the places i had selected for my uncle to pick, that was out of the usual places, and his son most likely not having experienced it.   I have been to another location (blue diamond and decatur) before, mid last year, for a friend's birthday. So liked to try a different location and compare experiences.   We arrived, a little before 7pm, on a tuesday evening. Seated immediately upon arrival, next to a group of 3, in the back, where their Hibachi (also known as teppanyaki) tables are at.   NOTE: HOT TEA IS $2.25 (not sure if its per person or 1 time group charge.... but they gave a cast iron tea kettle)  Since we were a party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child), most of us had opt'ed for their Hibachi combination. $28.95 including their Hibachi Basic Entree ($8.95) + 3 items of your choice (excluding kobe beef, halibut, lobster tail, and live seafood). Their items range from $6 - $9, so essentially, saving on 1 entree. The only person who didn't get the combination was my mom. She got the basic entree + lobster tail ($16.95)  Basic entrees include a soup, salad, vegetable (variety of veggies cooked in front of you), and choice of rice (white, brown, fried rice, or fried noodles).   Not going to list what EACH of us got, but in combination, we had ordered the New York Steak (5 oz - $7.25), Filet Mignon (5 oz - $8.55), Shrimp Teppanyaki (3 oz - $6.75), Scallop Teriyaki (5 oz - $8.55), Calamari (7 oz - $6.95), and the above mentioned lobster tail teriyaki (6 oz - $16.95)   The chef did his little performance with the fire and \"volcano\" act with the onions. First thing he cooked was the veggies, fried rice, and fried noodles.   Veggies were cooked well and seasoned nicely.  Fried rice had a nice \"bite\" to it and was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Fried noodles, a bit towards the salty side. Too much sauce used.   Afterward, the seafood, and the chicken (not ours, but was part of order for the group of 3 next to us) was cooked.   Calamari was SUPRISINGLY thick (1-2cm) and was cut into cubes. Cooked perfectly and was super tender. Not chewy AT ALL !   Scallops were HUGE fresh scallops that were cooked perfectly as well. Super tender, seasoned perfectly !  Lobster, though on the small side, was cooked ok. May be a little overcooked for my own preference, but seasoned nicely. Not sure when he removed the shell either.   After all the seafood was cooked, the new york steaks, and the filet mignon's were cooked. (yes chicken was still being cooked, slowly on the side).   To my surprise, the chef may have cooked the new york steak better than the filet mignon. Everyone in my party, ordered medium rare, whereas the other party, had medium. To be honest, i think all our pieces were medium to medium well. Though i had said the chef may have cooked the NY steak better, but doesn't mean it was well cooked. Both cuts of beef were overcooked to what we had ordered causing it to be a little chewy and dry, especially the filet mignon, being a lean cut of meat, but supposed to be tender due to the nature of it being a tenderloin.   OH ! With EACH phones check-in to yelp, you get a FREE small bottle of hot sake. We had gotten two bottles from using my check in and my mom's. Their sake was light. Fairly smooth to drink.   Overall experience was not bad. Performance ive seen better. Cook on various things, was good and bad, depending on the item. I think i'd prefer the blue diamond location more, experience wise, even though this one is much closer."}
{"text":"Frequent patron of this location. The only thing that kind of bothers me is that there are too many sushi dishes here that contain cream cheese, which, if you're like me, tastes weird with seafood. But the quality and tastiness of the food is excellent, as is the service and cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"I eat at Ohjah at least a few times every month, and it's become my go-to place for sushi.  The fish is fresh, the staff is incredibly friendly, and the prices are reasonable (not cheap, but reasonable).  My one complaint is that this location isn't open for lunch."}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail and decided to try this place out a couple weeks ago. We are so glad that we gave it a try! We went for the hibachi- I got the steak dinner and my boyfriend got chicken and we shared both meats. Our friend got the filet minion and said it was delicious. Where else can you get a 5oz. filet meal for $20?? For about $20 per person you get a perfect amount of food and a little bit of entertainment. I have no complaints about the quality of the food and service. We will definitely be back again and the coupons for free appetizer/sake, etc. certainly are a bonus!"}
{"text":"An amazing experience the best hibachi chef I have ever seen is charlie!!! Great for children, service very attentive! Food was one of the best ive had. Filet mignon and salmon was great"}
{"text":"The food was excellent I would love to go back again.. I have not been there in over a year but I plan to go back again"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and ordered way to much food- but that was half the fun.  Shrimp Tempura Meal: served with the best miso soup I have ever had. It wasn't overly salty like other misos I've had (especially towards the bottom). The salad was pretty good as well, but nothing to write home about. The tempura was on par with some of the best tempura I've ever had.   Sushi dinner (2 rolls) Las Vegas Roll: spicy tuna, cream cheese, spicy mayo, eel sauce. One of the best fried rolls I've ever had. It was really, really good.  Show Me the Love: spicy yellowtail, tuna, salmon, screaming O sauce (similar to spicy mayo). We fought over who got the last piece of this roll, on my birthday. That was how amazing it was.   Fatty Tuna: I didn't try any, but it looked and I was told it tasted, good.  Blue Fin Tuna: Again, I didn't get to try any, it didn't look like anything special, and was told it was unlikely that it was actually Blue Fin. :(  They brought me out a tempura banana dessert for my birthday. It was really sweet on the part of our server, and put a damper on us getting dessert somewhere else afterwards, but I was okay with that. :P  $60 for the amount of food we got was awesome. That's about how much we normally spend on all you can eat, and we got just as full but the rolls were better (although we probably won't put the AYCE place out of our list of go-tos)."}
{"text":"It's says open till 11 pm We came a party of 2 at 9:50 and didn't accept us . Why do I need to drive 20 min and not enjoy dinner because they have wrong hours on line ?"}
{"text":"I am just hoping it was an off-night in the kitchen.  Service has improved since my last visit.   The manager is always nice and attentive.   Aside from the sashimi, our meal didn't taste very good, maybe we didn't order well. The miso tasted like it was made from a packet, the salad dressing changed since my last visit and was not good...like watered down ranch or something.  More disappointing were our entrees the spicy beef was actually very bland and the sauce looked straight from a bottle, like something you expect from a take-out only Chinese Restaurant.   I got Tom yum soup, which I am pretty sure was made a paste it tasted too concentrated and not fresh.    So why three stars instead of two? I think their sushi/sashimi is above par, especially for the price.  If I come back I am just sticking to sashimi."}
{"text":"The best Japanese steakhouse and hibachi, and also 1.5 miles away form the pad. The hibachi chef slight of hand tricks and cooking skills were amazing. I had 2 orders of New York steak and 1 order of fillet Mignon  it also came with soup, salad, stir fry vegetables, fried rice.  Ounce for ounce and price wise the best steak in Las Vegas so far. The service was excellent and everything was clean. The bomb I am definite fan. I will be back !"}
{"text":"Giving it 3 stars so I don't affect the rating. We just got a bad feeling about this place when we drove up. I'm not sure why. Then we went inside and one of the letters was missing off of the restaurant name on the wall. That was enough for me to follow my intuition and leave. If they don't care enough to make an immediate good impression, there is no way I would trust them to serve me good sushi."}
{"text":"Hibachi can be fun when you're in the mood for it ~  This is meant to be a social affair and sometimes when we don't have our own group going we'll take our chances and see if we end up at a decent table. Sometimes it works out & you make new friends and other times you'd like to stick a pen in your eyeball :)  The experience is a show & dinner and for the most part the guys have great personalities and always make you smile with silly onion volcanoes and heart fried rice photo ops. The food is great. I really enjoy the salad & onion soup and we typically order the filet, chicken and I'll get salmon or shrimp every now & then. The chicken dries out the quickest so eat that the fastest and order your meat medium rare because it stays juicy that way. They give you plenty of delicious dipping sauces and ask for some teriyaki sauce for your rice. I like things sweet...  Check-in with yelp & get a free sake! This is a really nice touch and sometimes it's needed with all the birthday singing & screaming kids :)   It's loud, funny, warm from the fires and all this food fills you up! It's a great group spot or bring your family or friends for celebrations."}
{"text":"My only complaint I had before was the service. Not anymore!! They are going to open early just for my son's graduation celebration! Now that's service! Great service to go along with fabulous food at reasonable prices. Can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have hibachi!! Love that it's in the neighborhood!! Ordered the filet & lobster.. everything cooked perfectly,  great flavor.. Good entertainment by our hibachi chef!! Will be back for sure.."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere.  My friend and I loved the service.  Bruce our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  I had the deluxe shashimi.  The salmon was like butter, very fresh.  The bartender made us white peach sakitnis and we like that a lot.  This might be my new go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Absolutely fantastic. Great food, attentive staff. The sukiyaki was very good. The sushi/sashimi was very fresh.  The lychee sake was quite yummy. Overall, was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere good service, big room that can fit a nice size party. We had a few good rolls and great hibachi food."}
{"text":"Must try Kobe & live lobster !!!! Awesome food and service !!!!"}
{"text":"I took my friends to celebrate friendship and read a previous review about Ohjah. It sounded like a great place to try and it was well worth the adventure. Our server, Ren, was delightful and well versed with the menu. We ordered the \"boat\" with the rainbow, French kiss, and Show me the love rolls. Everything was delicious, fresh, and the sashimi slices generous. I'll return."}
{"text":"You go to a hibachi restaurant for the show, not the food. The show was fun and great for kids. The food was what you would expect--simple meats and vegetables. We had the steak and scallops--both were cooked to the perfect done-ness. Only the chicken comes with sweet teriyaki sauce. The other meats had a subtle soy sauce-base seasoning. The kids were captivated by the chef's cooking show, which allowed the adults to talk and eat in peace. They do offer appetizers (goyza potstickers, egg rolls) which are an inexpensive option for kids who may not be big eaters. Oh, and we got a free small sale with check in on Yelp--they will bring two cups if you ask. It was just the right amount for two."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST sushi in Vegas. My husband and I been here 4 times already and we keep coming back because of their freshness and customer service. If you're looking for a VERY friendly and GREAT FRESH sushi, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO! From the time you walk in to the time you leave, they treat you SUPER good. Their customer service is FANTASTIC! The sushi is beyond fresh and delicious. Besides that, the price is cheaper then anywhere else in vegas. WE LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"love the Hibachi grill. Sushi is good as well. Kids love the entertainment of the chefs!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE OHJAH!  Just around the corner from my house.  Some of the best quality sushi at a fair price I have found so far in Las Vegas.  Fish is always fresh, signature rolls are unique (Snow White roll and ohjah roll are my favorites) with some staples available as well.  I get sushi takeout from here once every 1-2 weeks, and we occasionally dine in at the hibachi table.  Chefs are always entertaining and excellent at what they do.  Can't beat freshly made fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and filet mignon.  They also have great deals on sushi and sashimi combo platters.  Always a pleasure to stop in!"}
{"text":"We went here here when m family was in town from Minnesota. We sat at hibachi table and it was very fun. Service was good but food was average. Everything kind of had the same taste from grilling it. Portions were very big and the fried rice was excellent. A bit over priced for quality but fun evening."}
{"text":"I always sit at the sushi bar and love the special rolls made by Chef Andy.  Great selection of cut rolls.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Tastes like 5 star, but so cheap! Customer service is amazing. I am at Ohja's at least once a week for take out since I have such a busy schedule, and I am never disappointed. :) Flsmingo and decatur location are amazing. Since my first date there with my boyfriend, I have loved it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with five other people and it was our first time here. I made a reservation and that was helpful because Habachi space is limited and they are busy. I can see why. The food was great and cooked to order. The chef was engaging and entertaining. Overall a great place and experience. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So I rarely ever post reviews but I had to in this case. Ohjah is great. The hibachi performance was amazing. Very interactive and entertaining. The chefs will have you laughing and ohhing the whole time. However the staff services was poor. It took them about 20 minutes to even get our drinks. Also as yummy as the food is it gave everyone in my party of 6 food poisoning. Perhaps it was just an off night for them or maybe a dirty towel. However I was very disappointed everyone in my party got sick.   I have eaten their sushi many time and never gotten sick but I will not try their hibachi ever again."}
{"text":"Five star for a very entertaining Habachi dinner with my husband. We both enjoyed our food and our experience. Our Habachi dinner comes with onion soup, fried rice, grilled veggies.Husband ordered the Kobe beef and it was cooked to perfection. I opt for a Lobster tail and Sea Bass that was cooked with lemon butter garlic---yummylicious! If you have room for an appetizer, try their soft shell crab, it's really good!  But Habachi dinner will not be the same without a great Habachi chef, he made our experience well worth it."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here this place has been amazing.  Hands down one of my favorite places.  I was there last night and the food still 100% on.  Everything went great.  Only gripe I have is that there were some insulting comments from the chef towards the woman I brought to dinner about here being with me.  I'm white and she is asian.  Don't know if maybe he just didn't like that.  Anyway the food and service has always been great.   Maybe I am out of line but it wasn't appreciated seeing I picked this place for our first date and she was the one that said it was insulting.  Love the food love the atmosphere would've been a lifetime customer but after that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent! It was my first time.... loved the lemon drop martini, had to cook my meat on a hot stone! and it was fun. My daughter was with me and hardly spoke! She was too busy eating her yummy fried rice... I absolutely recommend it. And will definitely be back in no time!!!!! Thank you guys, great job!! My waitress was so cool. She was Thai."}
{"text":"Food was good. The service is a different story. They took forever to come take our orders first of all. Second I don't think my bestie was too pleased with our waiter constantly reaching his arm over her food. Third... the waiter was quite entertaining though. He kept on popping up out of no where to see how we were doing, which was funny. The waiter just needs to improve  his table manners"}
{"text":"Seriously go here. It is so good. Had the hibachi and everything was delicious. Mary the bartender is so nice and she makes a mean Mai tai. The manager also super nice. They were so busy on Valentine's but he still finds time to speak with you and make you feel welcome. Great food and service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ended up here as a recommendation from the hotel front desk. Wasn't the best I have ever had but wasn't the worst. I lived in Japan and know good Japanese food. Food was cooked almost to order. Steak was a little over done and rice was partially cooked (Not the cooks fault but of the kids who sat with me at the table and decided to change their mind last minute). Wait staff was very friendly and polite. Prices wasn't too bad either. Chef was your typical hibachi chef with all the same American jokes so not a lot of originality there. I would go there again but wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"I only tried a couple rolls here, but they both were really good. The server recommend the pink lady to me, so that's what I tried and she was right. I definitely want to check it out again and explore other rolls that they have."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a couple years.  No complaints on the food, always great and customer service is great also!  We almost always do the hibachi when we go and it is always a pleasant experience.  Sushi there is great too!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. The hibachi experience is good and delicious.  Jack, the manager is very attentive and can be seen talking to the guests.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay, but compared to other hibachi places, this place just doesn't cut it. I ordered chicken and shrimp and fried rice, and everything was doused with soy sauce and salt, probably because there was no flavor on anything else. We mentioned it was my friend's birthday but apparently they don't do anything special for birthdays. I originally wasn't going to write a review on this restaurant until the young (maybe mid 20's) hibachi chef tried to throw shrimp in my mouth at the end of our meal. He missed, and said \"it's because your big nose got in the way!\" and laughed. Mind you, I hadn't said a word to him prior to this other than \"please\" or \"thank you\" so his rudeness was unwarranted. I'm sorry, but if you're hoping for a good tip or repeat business, don't be rude to your guests. Also, this place needs to find a storage space or something other than stacking their extra boxes of wine and plates and stuff everywhereeeee. It's an eye sore, distracting for guests and looks unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place is awesome I've gone a few times with friends and then another with my sister after trying out the place decided to have our family Christmas dinner there.  What a great choice the chefs were great, we had over 17 people in a private room the service was on time, they accommodated everyone's needs especially my mother and sister whom don't eat meat and very picky about how they eat....once again last evening a group of us went for dinner to celebrate a bday and had the best time with the best food....I highly recommend the food the service an all around good time!"}
{"text":"We love it here! Good food, great atmosphere, excellent service...Jack always makes us feel special. See you soon, Susan"}
{"text":"Ohjah certainly deserves all 5 stars, from the high quality food and presentation to the outstanding service.  A little background information on why we are giving 5 stars -- Hubby and I lived in West Los Angeles for 11 years, enjoying some great Japanese food.  When we moved to Orange County late 2011, we were highly disappointed by the lack of good or even just decent Japanese food in the area (it quickly became apparent to us that OC Yelpers did not know what we considered good food).  For the past 4-5 years, hubby and I have been really missing Japanese food, but we had given up in OC.  Hubby and I brought our little one to visit the in-laws here in Summerlin for Easter, and we got in yesterday from Cali.  Mother-in-law suggested we go to Ohjah, since they had eaten here about two weeks ago for their first time, and they really enjoyed it.  I had no idea that MIL doesn't even like Japanese food!  (She has had many disappointing experiences in her life.)  I guess Ohjah has converted her.  Husband was skeptical and wasn't ready to try it, until he read Yelp reviews yesterday evening.  We decided to eat dinner here to celebrate Easter, and we were pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything we ordered was.    We got in around 4 PM to avoid the dinner crowd, so we were promptly seated after many customary greetings.  We ordered the following:  Shrimp tempura dinner (included vegetable and seafood tempura, miso soup, and a salad) Miso soup Special Roll Combo -- we chose: Volcano roll (without cream cheese), Philadelphia roll, and Blue Diamond roll California roll Edamame Green tea ice-cream Vegetable fried rice Tempura ice-cream -- with tempura banana*  Comments about the food: 1)  If you are looking to order a few Special Rolls, the Special Roll Combo is really worth it; it is like buying 2 and getting 1 free! Such a great deal and so delicious.  Nice presentation was an added plus.  Everything was so fresh, including the raw fish.  Although the volcano roll was notated as a spicy roll, it wasn't, which I was happy with since I do not typically eat spicy foods. 2) Miso soup: I didn't have any, but my son, who is an extremely picky eater (secondary to his Sensory Processing Disorder) enjoyed it. 3) Shrimp tempura: so delicious that even my extremely picky eating son ate two bites!! 4) Additional tempura included yam, cuttlefish, imitation crab, and onions.  We liked it as it was not too thick with batter, light, and didn't appear too greasy.  Husband said the tempura sauce was not sweet, though. I typically dip my tempura in sauce, but I didn't because it was already really delicious. 5) I was really expecting just one scoop of green tea ice-cream so  I was so giddy when the bowl with 2 scoops and 2 mounds of whipped cream arrived! Before I could pick up a spoon, my little one was about 1/3 way through the first scoop.   6)  Our tempura ice-cream arrived shortly after, and our waiter politely commented that they put on extra tempura banana, which is typically a separate order.  I exclaimed to husband, \"We were just comped tempura bananas?!\"  We were thrilled because they were so good! Even MIL, who was skeptical of tempura desserts, enjoyed them.  We were guessing that maybe they comped us because the waiter had asked if it was our first time, and we had told him it was our first and our in-laws second.  Unfortunately, in-laws, who were so kind to pick up the bill, didn't know that we were comped the tempura banana so they felt embarrassed about not leaving a bigger tip (even though they tipped 20%). 7) The vegetable fried rice had a nice variety of vegetables (i.e., onions, broccoli, green peppers, carrots).  We ordered it for my picky son (who usually eats restaurant fried rice and not when I cook it), but he didn't even eat any because he was so into the Miso Soup.  I was expecting it to be greasy like Chinese restaurants, but it wasn't.  What added to our great dining experience was our very hospitable waiter.  He was attentive and personable, checking on us quite often and making small talk especially about our son, which is always nice since staff from other restaurants can wince when they see toddlers coming to dine.    When we were walking out, the manager or owner asked us how we heard about Ohjah, so we explained what was mentioned previously.  We noted that we will certainly be leaving a positive review on Yelp.  I don't typically write Yelp reviews on the same day unless it is that good (or bad).    In-laws mentioned that it used to be a Denny's that did terrible (couldn't even make decent hash browns), so they were really happy to see that it was replaced with a great restaurant.  They are hoping that people will leave more positive reviews so that this restaurant thrives.  In-laws live less than 5 minutes away, and needless to say, we will be back!  Next time, we are hoping to try the hibachi menu."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but do plan on going again.   We had the hibachi table and the show was on par or better than other chain hibachi places.   The choose 3 meat option offered so much protein at a reasonable price (we got steak, shrimp, and scallops) that  my husband ordered this and I stuck with the basic veggie option. There was no  additional fee to split a plate, which I always enjoy. When the chef realized we were splitting, he cooked the steak to each of our preference, which I find a high class customer service move.   The tempura is perfectly cooked, light and flakey. The veggies are fresh and crispy, which leads me to believe they receive fresh produce daily. The sushi is well prepared, but like a few other yelpers mentioned, a little on the small side, which is fine for an appetizer. I would have been bummed if I ordered that as an entree.   The service was spectacular. No dirty dishes sat for more than 30 seconds. I enjoy restaurants were the staff works as a team rather than saying, \"I'll get your server,\" and this is definitely the culture at Ohjah.   If you live in the area, you've probably received their flyers in the mail for free sake bombs or appetizers, which help you really enjoy a 3 course meal for under $50."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Love the food and service . I truly enjoy eating here to satisfy my Japanese cravings ! Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. Glad to have one near my neighborhood"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house and it had a decent amount of stars. This is a regular go to place for affordable sushi. There are no bento boxes here, but there are entrees for those that do not like sushi (for those who tag along..) The hibachi is reasonably priced too, but I have not dined on that side yet.  I've been here on a weeknight and a weekend night. The wait was ok. Not crazy long, but the manager offered us a free appetizer. The waitresses were friendly. The rolls were as described and so it was just okay. I did try the sashimi once here and they were cut smaller than the usual places."}
{"text":"We ordered the combination plate & a lobster plate.  The basic comes with soup, salad, fried rice or fried noodles & fried vegetables.    It was all FRESH & excellently seasoned & cooked.   Eddie was the Hibachi chef & he had a great & entertaining style. Everyone got a chance to catch flying food:) it was a Fan favorite.   The steaks were done exactly as they were ordered. The lobster was Perfect Too!  Very tasty, reasonably priced fun night!"}
{"text":"I am, maybe one of the biggest fans of Benihana (Burlington, CA). Every time I go to Vegas I make a point to go to OHJAH!  Of course Ohjah is a Hibachi Grill and the food is similar to Benni's but, I think Ohjah has them beat in some areas:  1. Ohjah's sald dressing is to die for! They even package a tub for me without an extra change. Benni's is delicious (ginger-like) but Ohjah's is divine. 2. Psh! The pricing is better. On the strip there is Benihana and I am told that they charge DOUBLE their original pricing. YES, I KNOW IT'S VEGAS but damn! 3. The sushi selection is varied at Ohjah and I feel in love with their Kamikaze roll.  Overall I recommend it to my friends shit, even a stranger that tell me they are heading to Vegas. I do mostly fine dining OFF OF THE STRIP . I also have a liquor store gem (Next door to OHJAH) hint, hint."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, the lady in the front welcomed us with \"is it 3 o'clock yet?\" (That's when they open) thought it was rude.. so if you're not opened, your doors should be locked ... Anyway.. we had a few rolls, first impression they're on the small side but overall, they were good!  the price is average. We were hoping not to get the same rude lady as our waitress but we did, needless to say, service wasn't the best, she only approached our table to take our order, bring the food and the check, reason why I'm not giving them a 5s rating (actúa it should be more of a 3  rating but I'm all about supporting small businesses) Parking is not a problem, and the restaurant is at a great spot!"}
{"text":"I loved it here!!! The experience was amazing for the price as well with above average food. Their French onion soup was really good and so was their salad. I ordered the salmon and it was fine!!"}
{"text":"I think they are pronouncing the name wrong, because to me it sounds like OH YEEEEAH!  Great bang for your buck. So much food. I ate till I was about to pop and still had what seemed like a full plate!  It isn't quite as tasty as Benihana, but it's loads less expensive.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place on the west side for great food as a reasonable price. The manager there is a young guy and he is EXCELLENT. He always checks with us to make sure everything is going well. Funny anecdote. One night we were there and he informed us that today was free sake day. If you wanted sake, it was on the house (house sake). After his insistence that we have some, I relented and ordered a small. He returned less than a minute later to tell me there was a problem; they were only serving larges."}
{"text":"Excellent Hibachi!!!!! Food was excellent!! Chef had some cool tricks we haven't seen before and was very funny!!!"}
{"text":"I was in a large party on a Friday night and got seated right away on the regular restaurant side. The miso soup was good, but didn't have a lot of tofu. The salad was good. I had chicken curry, which was yellow, flavorful and a generous portion. I also had chicken yakisoba, which really was outstanding. I tried the teriyaki chicken and it was good, but I thought the chicken katsu was better. I would like to try both their sushi and hibachi another time."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here. The food is always spot on. However it is a bit hard communicating with the staff due to the language barrier. Can't go wrong with the 3 meat combo . All around great restaurant and great food!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh sushi and great service! Every time I come here they are accommodating and friendly. I also love their yellow coconut Thai curry and they have a decent sake selection."}
{"text":"This establishment is decorated very well and has an upscale,  classy feel to it. The food here will no doubt exceed your expectations and the staff here really shows you that they truly want your business.  Note: Their ginger salad dressing was amazing"}
{"text":"Love eating the all you can eat here. Amazing always. We always sit at the bar and Mary is an awesome bartender/server! Seriously, the fish is always fresh, miso soup, even tho not a huge deal is best in town. lol We won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, and a welcoming environment. However, this is the first Japanese establishment I have walked into, and not been greeted by, or smiled at by the sushi bar, and the staff immediately.   The menu selections offered classic favorites, as well as a variety of specialty rolls that were wonderfully built. However, seeing as they are in Las Vegas, and surrounded by other sushi restaurants, I believe it would behoove them to add an all you can eat future to the menu, because the all a cart prices of some of the rolls are absolutely far too high for the way they are built. My rolls were delicious, but fell apart quite easily in my chopsticks, and the rice crumbled into the soy sauce. Now I am a traditionalist, so I barely do it when I roll into my soy sauce, and my row fell apart, all three of my rolls fell apart. Again, they were delicious!   It should be noted, that the tuna was the freshest I have seen in Las Vegas. It was dark dark pink, almost read. It was truly the chocolate of tuna fish. Bravo."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place.  We use it for two very different types of experiences:    1) The kids love hibachi/tepanyaki.  The food is very good and the show is always fun and funny.  The chefs are all very nice and willing to prepare your food as you request (medium rare, well done, whatever you ask).  They also do a nice job of pandering to the kids.    2) My gf and I really enjoy sitting at the sushi bar.  The fish is very fresh and there is always something new on the Specials Board.  The standard items on the menu are good, and somewhat different than every other sushi bar.  And they don't drown their rolls or nigiri in tons of ponzu (maybe because they don't have to hide the taste of lower quality fish?).  Also, sitting at the sushi bar, their sushi chefs work hard to interact with you and make it more of an experience than just a meal."}
{"text":"I love this place but you'll most likely need to call ahead a reserve a table. It's busy. Probably my favorite sushi in town."}
{"text":"LOVE the new location. We go here for the hibachi. SERVICE; The staff is all super nice. The cooks are personable.  FOOD; The food is amazing right down to the salad dressing. We were all impressed with the steak quality. Oh, and must order the fried rice, it's SOOO good! I recommend extra. They'll give you an extra cup for only $2, totally worth it.  AMBIANCE; The location is brand new, clean & nicely decorated.  PRICES; Fair pricing for quality food. You'll roll out stuffed to the gills."}
{"text":"The service was great and the chef was really nice but the food is way too salty. Our chef added way too much soy sauce in everything. The kids love the mini cooking show. It was a nice try but I don't think I'm ever coming back. The price was reasonable but I rather pay a little more and enjoy my food. Couldn't really eat any of the food, we ended up packing everything to go but tossed it in the trash bc it was just way to salty. Went here for Mother's Day dinner and good thing we made reservations be the place was packed. Give it a try u might have a better chef"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to takeout sushi in the SW corner of town. The blue diamond dinner special where with nigiri and you can pick two specialty rolls is where it is at. I've eaten here at least eight times and it is as consistent as it can be. If I ever leave this part of town, I will miss this spot indeed."}
{"text":"I went back after my review. The service was much better and the sushi was very cold.  I'll continue to go to Ojah"}
{"text":"I recently paid a visit to Ohjah restaurant on a Sunday night while my fiancé and I were in search of a \"new\" place we've never been before. We originally had planned to visit the Blue Diamond location after I was pleasantly surprised by their great Yelp ratings, but found ourselves near the Flamingo location which had identical ratings.   We entered and were both pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of the restaurant. They immediately asked if we wanted a regular table or hibachi table. Being that neither of us was super hungry, we opted to sit at a regular table. We decided we'd take the suggestion of many Yelpers and order one of the dinner specials. We decided on one right in the middle in price range, and boy were we delighted! It came with two special rolls of our choice, some sashimi and nigiri. It came quite quickly and was perfect size for our appetite for that moment.   We hope to return soon to try the hibachi tables! Hopefully this time, my phone will have enough battery life to take a good picture of my food this time! :)"}
{"text":"YUM. This place was amazing. We weren't able to decide on what we wanted so we ended up getting some sushi and doing the hibachi. The experience was so fun, the cool was very interactive w my niece and nephew. A very pleasant place for kids and adults. The sushi was incredibly fresh and the filet mignon was so tender. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to go with a large group!  22 of us came in and had a blast!  The hibachi was good...what you would expect from comparable hibachi places with a few nice nuances, but it was the quality of the sushi that really surprised me. My love and I decided to share some nigiri and a hibachi combination...little did we know that someone in our group ordered two Ohjah Boats consisting of 3 Special Rolls, chef's choice of 12 pieces of Sashimi,10 pieces of Nigiri, and seaweed salad. As fortune would have it, several individuals were not fans of sushi, leaving a few of us with the task of finishing this \"appetizer\" before the hibachi cooking began. The nigiri and sashimi caught my eye and my taste buds immediately, and I knew this would be a pleasant experience!  The Hibachi Chefs are really hit or miss. Our group was in a large private area with two hibachi tables, requiring two hibachi chefs. One of them was outstanding, entertaining, and immensely fun...the other?...well he did a fine job of cooking. I recommend going to hibachi in a large group. In most places, the tables seat eight or ten people, and I prefer filling the table as much as possible. Be sure to hone your food-in-mouth catching skills before you go to any hibachi spot since it is mandatory world hibachi law for the chefs to toss pieces of shrimp into any willing patrons gaping mouth...and while you could pass on this experience it is incredibly bad karma and the shrimp gods will also take note and punish you at a later date for your unwillingness to participate. Hey, you're the one who decided to go to a hibachi establishment in the first place, so know the rules and get over it!...but I digress.    Our nigiri arrived before the hibachi was finished cooking, and it was consistently good as indicated from the Ohjah Boat samplings. Ohjah's Hibachi Basic Entree must be ordered by every member of your party, except for children ordering from the kids menu. The Basic Entrée is $8.95 and includes Zucchini, Mushroom, and Onion Teppanyaki, a House Salad, Onion Soup, and your choice of Fried Rice, Fried Noodle, Steamed Rice or Brown Rice. We decided to add the Ohjah Hibachi Combination for $30.95, allowing you to choose 3 items (excluding Kobe Beef, Halibut, Lobster Tail and Live Seafood), electing to go with Salmon, Scallop, and Sole Fish. The scallops and sole fish were wonderfully cooked, while the salmon was a little over cooked...but by this point we had our fill and were now pawning portions of our hibachi off on our friends. Hibachi is not a meal I want to have often, but I'd certainly come back to Ohjah the next time hibachi is in order."}
{"text":"When we are in Las Vegas, this is our favorite sushi or hibachi grill go to place. The Las Vegas roll is the best so far from any of the other sushi places we have eaten."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ohjah in town they are the cleanest and most friendly and the food is outstanding I recommend coming to this location 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Food was fantastic. The server let us sample sake before ordering just the right bottle. We had sushi and apps. Great place."}
{"text":"6 of us went in for dinner as we had friends who wanted to try a new place.  We were seated in a booth made for 6 and it was very comfortable.  We started off with California roll which was tasty and gyoza which was equally good.  3 of us order the salmon teriyaki dinner, fish was tender and most and good sized portions.  My friends especially liked the fried carrot which was tasty.  Another person ordered the steak teriyaki and the meat was plentiful and tasty.  We also ordered the scallop teriyaki and that was equally delicious.  I ordered the unagi donburi and they also gave us free sake.  All in all the service was attentive and food was tasty.  Cons was that I had to wait a bit for my donburi and after dinner two of us were thirsty.  So I'm not sure if it was the weather or the food had msg."}
{"text":"Great service. The food was delicious and Charlie the hibachi chef put on a good show. Overall, the environment, employees, and experience was awesome. Will be back again."}
{"text":"The service was as awesome as usual, that's how this revue can even muster 2 stars. The food was severely lacking. We usually LOVE this place, but the chef tonight did not season anything. The veggies were still crunchy, the only thing he put on our shrimp and scallops was butter and lemon, and nothing at all on our filet. For the amount of money you spend here, it should be spectacular EVERY time!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I love going here.  The Hibachi menu is the best. I normally get the New York Steak and it tastes heavenly. Everything down to the soup, salad, fried rice, vegetables... amazing. The show is fantastic as well, I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Service was disorganized and extremely slow. They made up for it with free drinks and ice cream, but we were left with a bad taste in out moths mouth when the manager insulted me to my face and proceeded to talk about inappropriate things on the way out of the restaurant. I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"They finally opened this place near our house.  We normally frequent the Decatur and Blue Diamond location.  We love this place.  At this location we noticed new items on the sushi menu and tried three of them.  It was all so good.  Merri recognized us from the other location and she is now the bar tender here at Flamingo site.  We always order the Ohjah boat as it always has little of everything we like (choice of sushi rolls and my favorite Sashimi)  I'll be here every week.  LOL!"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas to celebrate my wife's birthday, we were looking for hibachi to kick off our Friday night plans and decided on Ohjah. Great move on our part.  The food was delicious, our chef was entertaining, very personable and kept us engaged throughout his cooking performance. Had a great time and would come back the next time we visit Vegas. Thanks for a great kickoff to my wife's birthday weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing teppanyaki grilled meal. We had Eddie as our chef and he was absolutely amazing. One of the best we've ever had in terms of entertainment.  The atmosphere was wonderful...darker lit, (which I didn't mind at all) and very classy. Dress casual or be more dressy...doesn't matter.  Need a fabulous place to eat for 2 for less than $50? (2 grill meals, soda, one glass of wine). I highly recommend this place!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We eat sushi here about once a month but last night the sushi and service were both disappointing. We waited about 5 min for anyone to come greet and seat us. Once we were seated in one of their cubicles, we waited another 15 min for a waitress to come greet us.. Then she forgot our beer. Our cold sushi was warm and our hot eel came out cold."}
{"text":"Great place to come in, good sushi and good hibachi. Not too long or no wait at all. Recommended to come in to get some good Asian food!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty boring..I get the same thing every time I'm there. I choose the Hibachi Table and get the filet mignon, medium rare, and fried rice. It's delicious    They are pretty efficient at the Hibachi Table; you can be entertained and enjoy your dinner in about an hour...so it's a good choice if you want dinner before you dash to your reserved seats at The Summerlin 5 Regal theater. I also like that they will do separate checks if you come in with a group...heads up though, if it's six or more people they will add the (divided) tip to each of the separate checks. They don't tell you that little tidbit, so I'm telling you so you don't accidentally overtip.   They have these little rooms with tables that seat about 6 people...so if you want to linger over your meal, that's the perfect seating for a small group. Probably a good idea to request those about a week in advance."}
{"text":"Never been to a teppanyaki restaurant before and needless to say, I'll be back here! The atmosphere was fun yet not seeming crowded. Out chef was fantastic and the way he prepared the calamari was so yummy! Fantastic time all around!"}
{"text":"Disappointing course sizes! Especially with the menu prices! Super expensive for such small pieces of chicken or steak or filet! You would think for paying so much you'd get a decent size piece of steak or chicken but your surprisingly gonna get a little piece! Also charged for burnt friend rice. For such awesome reviews defiantly was disappointing"}
{"text":"Very accommodating on a busy Saturday night with a party of 5 plus a baby!!!!!! The food was amazing as usual & the service is always on point!"}
{"text":"After 3 years I can say this place has officially peaked at a 3 star rating. My family and I used to love this place but it seems as the general quality of the place has gone down. My family and I will always get the boat and one week they didn't charge us for extra tempura flakes. The next time they did. The following time they didn't. (inconsistent, especially to typically loyal customers) On busy nights the quality of food tends to suffer. Last night our baked green mussels came out lukewarm. Our sever confused our boat order and had us switching the checks back and forth for a discount with LVAC. The quality of fish is still better than most AYCE. But this place is no longer our go to family spot."}
{"text":"This is our go-to take out-of-town visitors spot if we want to stay in Summerlin. We've been a few times already and always get great service (even right after the business opened!). All the hibachi chefs are talented, entertaining and funny in their own ways. The food is very reasonably priced for hibachi and you definitely will get your money's worth between the soup/salad/veggies/fried rice/entree(s). The waitresses make sure your water cups are full and check-in frequently. There has always been someone to kindly greet us at the door and say thank you as you walk out - I really appreciate that extra attention they make sure to pay their customers. The staff/management does a great job in making sure they earn your (repeat) business. And just an FYI if you have shy dinner guests, the chefs always do the \"shrimp toss\" at the end of the meal, but you can always decline it - which means more shrimp for everyone else!"}
{"text":"We went here for an early Mother's Day dinner with the kids age 6 and 4 (in two weeks). Our four year old got a little scared from the flames, but mostly enjoyed it. Our six year old had a ball. He couldn't stop laughing at the chef and the chef was laughing at his comments about the experience. The chef had a doll filled with water that peed out water on to the flames. He then turned the doll onto the kids like a squirt gun and started firing at them. My oldest son was Laughing Out Loud so hard that he made the chef more engaged with them. I wish I caught his name, but I'm terrible with names. I would recommend this chef to any others visiting there because he made the experience so much better for the kids. I left an over 20% tip because I'm sure my family will remember this for awhile! Well worth it. Food was great! My wife and I got the Hibachi Combo to chose three. I got Filet mignon, shrimp, and teriyaki chicken. I think my wife got shrimp, calamari, and NY steak. Of course I couldn't finish it all, but we got a box and a great lunch for tomorrow. If Ohjah reviews comments, we were the party of four for Jeff at 8 pm on 5/13. If you know the chef that served us, please pass on my comments! Loved it! The host and servers were great too. I recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! I've recommended this place to friends. They've never been dissatisfied and always glad for the recommendation.  Always nice to watch the hibachi professional cook right before your eyes. Never a boring show and the hibachi tables."}
{"text":"Was there with my friend and order the deal for the sushi, it is a big dish and very satisfying... very tasty food, love it!,  Can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"Our go to spot! Prices increased a bit but still reasonable. Our favorites are the 3 roll special and the yakisoba dishes. Everything is delicious. Great service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"To be honest, we went here because our usual place, geisha house, was already closed.  It was 10:30pm, so we were kind of surprised, most places are open til at least 11pm.  Oh well, yelp to the rescue!  Ohjah was really great!  The staff was friendly and accommodating, the chef was funny and had some tricks we had never seen anywhere else.  The food was excellent.  I had the shrimp, my friends had the steak and chicken.  We were all extremely happy.  the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because we all agreed there was something really weird and bad about the fried rice.  So I would recommend getting the noodles or white rice instead.  Overall it was great and its nice that they have sushi as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in vegas.  They were pretty busy last night so we seated ourselves at the bar.  Our sushi chef was very friendly and took our order right away.  The sushi was fresh and the tempura green tea dessert was delicious!"}
{"text":"Review for Hibachi side... FANTASTIC! Good food, entertaining chefs and fun evening out!! We enjoyed all sorts of tummies! Started with the garlic edamame.... Yum! Perfect amount of garlic and heat. A couple of us had the fried noodles and a couple had the fried rice... Both were delicious...I just prefer fried rice myself and I thought there's was very tasty... And it was a big serving. I enjoyed the NY steak and calamari.... The calamari was Spectacular!!! It was better than the shrimp and scallops. Better texture and flavor. And I'm not a huge calamari fan... But this was THAT good! Meaty and succulent. Steak was prepared perfectly. Veggies were also quite tasty.... Steamed with a light fry.... Not soggy at all. Our chef was fun and entertaining...while being professional and efficient.  Overall... I totally will come back!!  Highly recommend making a reservation.  The hibachi table sits 8.  Tip: if you are an LVAC member...you get 10% discount. :)"}
{"text":"This place is not even a week old! Excellent Japanese food! I had short ribs, tempura. miso soup, salad with ginger dressing, rice. Maybe next time I'll brave some sushi. Not a big fan of that."}
{"text":"First time here and I like it raw. The fish was very fresh and flavorful. Roll was well made with just enough rice. Presentation was beautiful. Wish I had taken a photo but was so hungry couldn't wait.  Service was quick and friendly.   Beautiful decor and felt somewhat absorbed in the Japanese culture with the Japanese music playing- very romantic even though I was alone in the middle of the afternoon. The big screens put me off a bit but not too much since they were silent...thank you.  Checked in on Yelp and got a small hot sake...yeah! I bookmarked and will certainly return soon."}
{"text":"One of the worst Japanese steakhouses I've ever been to. The only thing that was slightly tasteful was my gin martini. Chicken was dry. Rice comes in small portions. Noodles were flavorless. The chef was awkward. As we were eating, they proceeded to clean the grill with cleaning supplies in front of us. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Love the Hibachi Bar especially with great friends!  We always enjoy their food here!"}
{"text":"Really great sushi and staff is super attentive and very friendly!  Will go back again."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite sushi spot ! Why ? Cause the sushi and sashimi pieces are bigger than the normal places I've been . There not stingy . Really good fresh uni! Hubs ordered kalbi ... everything we ordered was delicious ."}
{"text":"A nice cozy Japanese hibachi restaurant.  My bf and I were excited to try their hibachi since the last experience we had (not going to mention the other hibachi restaurant) was not very good and memorable.  So, we ordered the New York steak and Shrimp hibachi with a couple of rolls. Let's start with the rolls - they were basically the highlight of our dinner. We tried the White Tiger and the Captain's rolls which were both surprisingly delicious. A must try! So after that we thought it will be better since the rolls were so good. Then the weird onion soup came. It had deep fried onions and crispy noodles in a clear broth. It would've been better if there were no crispy noodles. It just tasted funky. The salad that came with the hibachi set wasn't bad. So the hibachi chef started his show and cooked our food. My bf was getting nervous already when he saw how the chef cooked it. He didn't season the steak and shrimp. Put a little salt, soy sauce and pepper in the fried rice and veggies. So when we tasted our food, unsurprisingly it was very bland. I had to shower the whole plate with salt. Our hibachi experience was once again a disappointing one. We were not even given a sauce to dip our shrimp and New York steak. We saw on the other table, the chef gave them automatically the sauce. Plus the chef from the other table seasoned the shrimp and steak well by putting a little lemon and butter. Probably we were just unlucky getting that chef.  The service was not bad. The servers were attentive that's why I am giving 3 stars - one for each roll and service.   Oh one more thing, I think their hibachi is pretty pricey. So the basic hibachi with veggies is $8.95 and if I want extra shrimp, it's extra $7.95 for probably 6 pieces of small shrimp.   Maybe we will back for the rolls but for sure not for the hibachi unless we can be guaranteed that it will not be the same chef again."}
{"text":"Great prices and good food. Loved it :) Kenny was our chef did a bomb job, had us cracking up the whole time."}
{"text":"Pros:Very tasty,food arrives in a timely manner,nice setting and seating  Cons:Kept having to ask for sauce as you are provided with a small amount"}
{"text":"Tonight, we had a big party with 28 adults and kids. We booked the party room and it was nice for us since you can sit behind a closed door. Hibachi was entertaining . The chef made fun performance for the kids. Beside those usual techniques, we saw some new staff, like pupping heart shape from fried rice, smoking mountain from onion, Micky mouse from eggs and even animal balloons.  He made all the kids laughing and smiling. The steak and scallops were perfect cooked and the fried rice was moist.  Overall , we all enjoyed the delicious hibachi with endless laughter and clapping hands. For whoever wants to host a party, you should differently think about book the Ohjah party room!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Sushi restaurant I town. The food, the service and the staff are awsome! The manager Min is amazing. He is always so accommodating and friendly (One of the many reasons we always come back). If you are looking for delicious Sushi, amazing Hibachi cooking and a wonderful atmosphere, Ohjah is the place."}
{"text":"This place has officially bumped Sen Of Japan for my number one sushi spot in Vegas. Mainly there's one large difference: the quality of fish and the portions of the rolls are fantastic at both places, however, Ohjah has a few pricing specials that are even a greater value than all-you-can-eat. There is the blue diamond platter that has four pieces of sashimi, two special roles of your choice, and five pieces of nigiri. The boat platter and bonsai platter are also tremendous values. I chose the bonsai which is 2 special rolls of my choice plus ten pieces of nigiri. My date and I would normally go out for all-you-can-eat-sushi, and we would spend at least 60 bucks after tax. But here, we spent under 60 while getting better quality sushi with better & bigger portion size and couldn't even eat it all!  All-you-can-eat joints have lesser quality fish and smaller rolls. The sushi chefs at Ohjah were super friendly too. They both chatted us up all night. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...!!   Impeccable service, awesome food!   The three rolls we suggest is the Snow White, Ohjah Roll & Give me A Break Roll!!!  Also, if you are a LVAC member you will get 10% off!!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my husband's birthday and the food was delicious. The only reason this wasn't a five star rating is because of the wait for our meal to be prepared.  I liked the option of being able to get fried noodles our fried rice. The cost is a LOT less than other places which is definitely a plus with a family of four to feed. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  I had a really good meal at Ohjah.  I went to the teppanyaki section of the restaurant, but they also have regular Japanese dining and a surprisingly extensive menu.  Prices are very fair and we even got free small sakes upon check-in.  Together we ordered the chicken and the shrimp teppanyaki meals with fried rice for one and noodles the other.  Each came with a large serving of rice/noodles, a small salad, a cup of onion soup, lots of vegetables, and 4-5oz of our desired meat.  All of this (for 2) came out to about $35.  The amount of food they provided, with quality at every stage, was actually very surprising.  The noodles and rice were flavored well but not much going on in them.  The shrimp and chicken were great.  And the salad and soup, both unexpected with our order, were a nice opening course.  I really like the speed of teppanyaki restaurants where food is constantly being served upon completion with the chef entertaining as we go.  I usually don't enjoy sitting with other people during my meal, but I guess that's part of the show.  We had a couple of weird eating neighbors so I would recommend coming with a group (6-8) to get a full on better experience.  The servers were great.  The chef was entertaining and did not disappoint in tricks and showmanship.  The portions, quality, and price were all on point.  Give Ohjah a go if you want some good teppanyaki.  And they have a few locations across the city so seek out your closest.  You might want to make a reservation or call ahead though as primetime is sometimes really full for this restaurant's live cooking section."}
{"text":"We walked right in and requested for the Hibachi grill for 6. Best to make reservation ahead of time but we got lucky and got there just in time to join another group. Jimmy our chef was amazing and enjoyed every minute. He has a great positive attitude and is very entertaining . Jimmy did some cool tricks while preparing the food and cooking it right in front of you on an awesome frying type skillet table. You get rice or noodles, mixed veggies,  soup, and a salad for a set amount to start and then you pick what kind of meat/seafood you want for an additional price. Looking at about $20 per plate for the basic chicken or steak. Kobe and lobster selection was a bit pricey. After all cooked up and served you were given two type of sauces to dip your meat/seafood in. To be honest quality of meat was great but not so much flavor to it unless you drenched it in the sauce. You can also get sushi as well. I got two rolls and was very tasty. For about 6 of us bill came out to be about $155, keeping in mind most of us only had water or icetea, 2 rolls, and bill was with gratuity included since we were a party of 6. We enjoyed ourselves very much! Ask for Jimmy and don't forget to tip your chef when he's done with the show! :)"}
{"text":"First time today and definitely won't be the last! We had the special rolls: kamikaze, grand canyon & tsunami. So delish! Their Boba drinks too is a must try. Service by Mary is excellent. It's also a kid-friendly place so no worries to bring our little ones inside."}
{"text":"Nice place, service awful, attempted to take order before looking at menu. Quality of food awful as well- not fresh - especially vegetables - all food very reasonable- will not go back."}
{"text":"They were a bit unorganized at the front and the first time we called last night, no one answered, but they got us seated before our reservation and our teppanyaki chef Eddy was amazing and everything was cooked to perfection. Ohjah has always been one of my favorite teppanyaki restaurants in Vegas. I keep coming back and I always will."}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience here. Went to try their sushi, ended up ordering the yakigyu and fried rice for our toddler (he only picks at sushi). Tried the Golden Gate roll, Captain, & Dragon no avocado plus cream cheese. They were all part of the special rolls, which offers 3 special rolls for $23.95.   The Dragon was topped with thinly sliced seared eel, just what I prefer. I've had Dragon rolls with large hunks of eel on top in the past, was not a fan. This one was sweet and creamy (cream cheese) with the tempura crunch.   Next was the Captain- cucumber and spicy with sliced albacore and fried onion topping. Seriously good balance of flavors, fresh fish. Added ginger to spice it up, I love a SPICY tuna, just personal preference. ;)  Last was the Golden Gate which was the perfect ending. Shrimp tempura, Cucumber, crab with variety of fresh fish sliced on top and CRUNCH. this was my fave! Very fresh fish. Next time I'm going for the sashimi, the table next to us had the boat of sashimi, nigiri, & rolls...but I like to dip my toes at sushi places with rolls first, to see how quality their product is before diving into sashimi.  Skip the yakigyu, beef skewers...very dry. Could have shot it at our neighbors sushi boat, for a good battle.   One HUGE surprise was their fantastic fried rice. I never would have ordered something like that there...glad we did. It was clean, fresh, flavorful. I haven't had a good fresh fried rice that's not homemade since I don't know when. They all end up tasting like soy sauce greasy onions. Not this one.  Our server was great. She was friendly and had good timing. She took our drink order ASAP, gave us time to look, checked in, we needed more time, she happily obliged, checked in when we were ready, filled our waters and kept the sake flowing. All with an authentic smile and calmness even when they got busy. Really couldn't ask for more there.  One disclaimer- 3 rolls was more than plenty for 2!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the atmosphere and our server Kayla was awesome. Took care of us and always recommended other items to us just in case we didn't like something. We ordered from the hibachi menu but without the show because they were busy. We didn't mind because we were super hungry but everything still tasted great. The strawberry Mochi ice cream was delicious too! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was there for dinner a week ago with my family. The food was not fresh at all and no flavor. Our waitress Savannah was helpful and such a sweet lady. While we were eating the manager was like watching us eating like we were going to skip out on the check. I know I'm Spanish but the manager don't have to be like a guard dog. My wife asked the hibachi chef if she can some more sauce for her steak and he just said no and tell us to ask our waitress. I know the waitress and waiter makes tips for living but they are server not servant. After all that me and my family won't ever comes back here. I hope they change the way they work and I hope they change the manager there too."}
{"text":"I  love this place the hibachi is great and the chefs that cook for you are so entertaining. The prices is very reasonable and you get great service, I would recommend anyone who is looking to go out to a nice restaurant at a decent price to try this place."}
{"text":"Always have a pleasant experience! We try to go every other Sunday or Monday because we truly enjoy it there! The food is tasty and the staff is friendly and make sure you are well taken care of! We have our usual: gyoza and calamari tempura as appetizers, chicken yakisoba and chicken fried rice! The honeydew ball is a super tasty drink :) We also have hibachi frequently with our friends and family!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Ohjah! The guy that cooked for us was a classic(classic means good) was very good cook and kept us all interested the whole time. I would say one of my favorite spots to eat"}
{"text":"Hum...nah.  It doesn't worth the average 4 star that most people give.  Service is friendly, decoration is good and that's it. Value is bad. I spent a lot of money for hibachi dinner and was still hungry. Portion is small, food is greasy and salty.  I've also ordered sashimi combo to supplement but for that price, sashimi pieces were cut into very small portion also. And, it was not fresh. It's a meh and sorry but I will not return."}
{"text":"Frequent patron, we are always greeted and seated quickly. We always leave satisfied. Definitely a step up from the typical sushi bar that offers all you can eat. Fantastic atmosphere. Must try if you are a sushi lover."}
{"text":"Stellar sushi! Excellent service! Great selections! I'm in love with the garlic edamame and the Summer Breeze roll!   I once had poor service and immediately went home and contact management via Facebook--I was promptly contacted and the problem resolved! That being said, one bad experience isn't enough to sway me in a negative direction; I believe in second chances!  Love this place and will continue to return regularly! ;)"}
{"text":"I HATE sushi and sea food in general so when my brother and sister in law brought us here I was in a panic!  However.....we sat at the table to watch the show and it was an incredible experience.  The steak was honestly the best steak I have ever eaten!!! The fried rice...OMG yummmm!!!  My husband even said that the red (fatty?) tuna was the best he ever had as well.  It has been a few months since that night but I have been thinking about that food since then.  We will definitely be back and would recommend it to anyone. :)"}
{"text":"I have a theory about the high marks on this place, versus my very fair rating of \"2\" stars:  1. The person has never had any other Japanese food, and so does not know better;  2. People are drinking a lot of sake and so the taste of the food really does not matter;  3. These awesome reviews are a bit old;  4. or, the place just had a bad night the night I went.  The reason for 2 stars:  1. The food was really, really overcooked. Everything was overcooked. \"Cook it 'till it's dead!\" must be their mantra. Steak, overcooked. Vegetables, overcooked. Rice, overcooked. Chicken, overcooked. Fish, overcooked. Shrimp, overcooked. Tempura, overcooked. (And greasy! The oil needs to be changed...or just made hotter. Tempura, though fried, is not supposed to taste greasy.)  Tea, overcooked! Shoot, even the salad was overcooked...okay, just kidding about that. But really, everything was super overcooked. It's like, are they fighting against amoeba dysentery, or something? What IS it???  2. The place needs a little renovating. It's a fun atmosphere, especially the hibachi area, but everything feels like it's about 5-10 years due for a renovation. (It might not even be that old, but it feels like that!) There were some areas where cleanliness, or rather, repairs, were needed, that were obvious. You know what they are, Ohjah!  3. The service was really uneven. Not enough attention at the table (water and tea glasses were not filled within a reasonable time).  And rather than sincerely asking how everything was, the tone of question was, \"You like everything, RIGHT?!!\" NOT EXACTLY CONDUCIVE TO HONEST FEEDBACK...like, \"Dude, you killed my steak so dead, it would not have a chance at the afterlife, even in India!\"  On the plus side (why it is not 1-star), it is a fun, rollicking and convenient  place to dine. If you came just for drinks, you would have a terrific time.  So, maybe it's just an off-night. But don't take your most important client there, or your best sweetie, without checking it out first."}
{"text":"This some what new chain has been a go-to for me and my partner after discovering it from a couple we consider close friends. Our first experience was so good we have gone back multiple times, their service and food is always consistently great. They offer great deals for checking in with them on Yelp, just a helpful tip if you plan on dining there. The sushi is so fresh and so clean, the service is quick and professional. Just beware that the location on Lake Sahara is Hibachi only, so if your in the mood for their sushi avoid that location. I've never had their Hibachi but their sushi is one of the best I've tried here in Vegas for a great price. Try them out and leave a review!!!"}
{"text":"First off very nice interior design. You just don't expect this when you drive up. Service excellent the staff was nice professional and very friendly. Glasses never got empty they were so attentive. Food was great had the trepan and the best we have had. The menu had so many good items as we'll and the sushi looked awesome. We are coming back to try the sushi.   There are many Japanese and sushi places in Summerlin but this place is a hidden gem. You have to try it."}
{"text":"My favorite place ever! Its affordable for a hibachi. Everyone who works there gives a positive attitude. My glass never comes close to being empty before they refill it.  The chefs are awesome! They are so interactive and hilarious! Its such a classy place! No matter if its a date night, with the kids, or your whole family everyone will have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here for the company Christmas party weeks ago and we all had a really good time! This was my first time at a hibachi restaurant, so I wasn't sure what to expect... One thing I did know ahead of time is that it's pretty pricey, so I'd only come here for special occasions, but the quality of the food & the overall experience makes it worth it.  We reserved one of the bigger private rooms, which had two hibachi grills & cook stations surrounded by countered seating. I'd say there was enough room for a party of 20 or so. Eddie, the chef assigned to my side of the room, was super friendly and the little show he put on while preparing our food was hilarious!  Their menu is pretty big, although I'd recommend sticking with the hibachi route. There's several meats to choose from, including a few different seafood options. I ended up getting filet mignon and a sushi roll - which was MORE than enough - but if you've got a real hunger and are eying more than one thing on the hibachi menu, I'd try the Pick Three option. For about $30, you can choose any 3 meats (excluding lobster, Kobe beef, etc.) If you order any hibachi item, you also get onion soup & a simple salad as appetizers, along with your choice of fried rice or noodles.  All in all, I'm glad we came to Ohjah! The one complaint I do have is that there was a scheduling conflict with our reservation. We were scheduled for 8:00, but once we arrived, there was a still an earlier party having dinner in our private room. Eventually, they wrapped up and it all smoothed out, but it was a little disappointing regardless. I'm gonna have to knock off one star for that... OTHERWISE, Ohjah was great. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like going here. It is very convenient for me, specially if I want some Japanese / Hibachi /  Thai dish in one place. My son loves their crunch roll and the spider roll. Love that you get a discount with LVAC membership card. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"I come here and order the same thing, I'd hate to try something I don't like. I order the Beef sukiyaki. The flavor is really good, a little on the sweet side. The soup has clear noodles, veggies and a generous amount of meat, with rice on the side.  I can't stray away from this dish, all time favorite :)   My son really likes it here, fancy taste for a 6 year old. He orders the shrimp udon tempura. He likes it with extra shrimp tempura, tentsuyu and of course with a side of edamame. He loves it and can eat halfway through the bowl.   Service here is very good, they really tend to the tables.   We eat pretty simple here, maybe we'll try the Hibachi table someday."}
{"text":"My favorite Las Vegas sushi spot!  Reasonable prices and always good quality.  Too bad they aren't open for lunch though."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but a few things didn't sit right.  The Good.  The hibachi chef had some serious acrobatic knife skills! The food cooked on the grill was mostly done well. my sushi roll was good too.   The Bad. Got a flat soda. The salad had french dressing on it, instead of a miso carrot dressing. The dipping sauces for the hibachi grilled foods wasn't to my liking. They really like to cook a lot of the hibachi items with teriyaki sauce. It really was too sweet and killed all the benefits of cooking on a hibachi.   The teriyaki pushed it over the edge for me. I could forgive their other condiment choices, but the sickly sweet sauce was too much. At least give an option not to use the teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"My family has been to this place many times. It's always exceptional food and service. All of the rolls and sushi are delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food. Only good thing is portion is large and lots of tables available.  Chefs behind sushi counter are all Chinese. Our waitress wasn't necessarily rude but... wasn't the friendliest. We asked for shredded daikon, she said its in the sauce already. We had to ask her again for \"more\". She also kept trying to clear our plates when we were not finished. Pretty much much be back there."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the neighborhood! Ohjah definitely can deliver great quality food, drinks, and entertainment for great value. My only complaint, it's turned into a cheap dining experience for families. I suggest they have adult-only hibachi tables or put the families in that back room-they can all play together! I prefer to dine with those who want to enjoy the experience, not parents who bring their iPads & screaming children to dinner seeking entertainment. It's unfair to the chefs who put forth hard work & awesome entertainment and to other guests at the hibachi table. I have noticed that one chef(who will remain anonymous) has picked up on the rudeness of some guests, and they do not receive the same attentiveness. Good job, buddy!"}
{"text":"Food was good fish tasted fresh real nice ambiance, and service was on point. They have private booths which is really nice and intimate. Had the fried tofu, yellowtail jalepeno, and other dishes, Great place to take a date.  Would def. be back soon!"}
{"text":"I only tried the teppanyaki last, the show of chef was nice but the food for teppanyaki was little bit too sweet"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner Saturday and this place did not disappoint. You would never know that the place is so well set up inside. From the teppan tables, regular dining seating and the bar its a really cool place. We ate at the teppan tables and it was a great experience. I had the filet and lobster, delicioso. Everybody was happy, our chef was in high spirits and they had a good selection of sake. Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The teppanyaki was decent. I think our chef might have been the newer guy because the other tables had a bit more of a show, but it was still fun and the food was good."}
{"text":"So I've only ever gotten to-go from this place but EVERY TIME it's so good!!! The sushi and sashimi is so fresh, the teppan and yakitori are awesome! Every time I pick up my food it's ready immediately and the place is always slammed busy. I have to actually come and dine in sometime. The food is sooo good"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The manager I think his name is Jack went out of his way to make sure everything was fine.   We had sushi. The boat. A lot of food for a great price."}
{"text":"I feel so bad I didn't review before been here many times ever and is so happy and greets us with a smile very wonderful place to come and eat food is excellent prices reasonable We are continuing their birthday celebrations my wife and I please come enjoying the great atmosphere here you have a wonderful time"}
{"text":"I love this place it's so good with customer service and treat you like family. I come here a couple of times a week with my friends. They make special items for me and the bartenders are awesome as well,"}
{"text":"Have lived in the area for several years but had never tried Ohjah. We've got plenty of japanese restaurants in the area and truthfully, none have ever stood out as being great. Some do have good happy hour bargains, some have fun bar scenes, but as for really good food, the area hasn't delivered. Our family decided to give this place a shot. And it really worked out well. Food was really, really good. Atmosphere was very nice. Looks like a great place for a date for single people, and also for a family night out. Service was also really good. They definitly have a system in place that all the servers know and execute well. Everyone was in a very good, pleasant mood. Sushi was very fresh. The habachi is very good, very reasonable prices. My habachi steak, with veggies, rice, soup, salad, and steak, was 17.95.If your in the area, I'd really recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"You have to go here for the Hibachi dinner. We didn't know the restaurant was known for this - -  we ordered garlic edamame, three roll combo and watched our friends eat an amazing dinner, Waaaaaaaaaaa. Master Chef comes out and entertains you while he's chopping, flipping, firing, juggling and slapping the food around.  It was VERY entertaining and the food looked delicious.  It made our rolls look very boring.  Ha! The servers were great. Oh! And if you check in you can get a free hot sake (whoo hoo! ) its a small bottle - - about the size of the soy sauce bottle so have your friends check in and you all can each have your own starter drink :)"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the sushi, prices and service we received. We stopped in 30 minutes before closing on Christmas. It was our first visit and we will definitely be back. The fish was fresh and some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is great restaurant for family or group of friends wanting interactive dinner.  A classic Japanese live cooking set-up with Chef being the center of attraction. We ordered Chicken, Lobster tail, Shrimps and Tofu.  Each item was cooked to, true, perfection as we requested with fresh greens (off the hot plate) as sides. As we kept digging into our dinner, Chef has not finished the show - he put a Onion volcano - just added more punch to our evening. What a great family evening - they made it special Strongly recommend  this restaurant  We will be back, for sure"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant,  very friendly staff  and good food! waitress was very nice and very patient :). Definitely coming back with my friends."}
{"text":"First in a long time since I had a teppanyaki dinner and I must say a thoroughly enjoyed it very much.  Our teppanyaki chef was fun and very entertaining.  My steak was grilled perfectly and very tasty.  I love the fried rice, lots of garlic! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had Jakk as our server and he was awesome! We tipped him 20%! He met our every need and even gave us a birthday dessert. It was a birthday to remember. I had the fried wontons. The dippin sauce had an extra hint of citrus that was delectable. Then I ate a crunch roll. My taste buds were tickled with deliciousness. I finished up with the chicken udon. Nom nom nom. This place is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place bc of the other reviews and was very disappointed! I ordered the shrimp and steak hibachi with rice and added a side of noodles for an extra $3.99. The soup and salad that came with the meal was ok but the dressing was very watery! The chef was friendly and stated that he was new so I assume that's why my experience differs from others. The shrimp and steak had zero flavor.. He only added a tiny bit of garlic to the shrimp along with a ton of salt and the steak had only salt and pepper on it with no other seasoning. The noodles ended up having the best flavor so I'm happy that I paid the up charge and added them on. The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 was the amazing sushi role we started with... Needless to say I won't be back again which is a bummer since it's right around the corner from my home."}
{"text":"This is an awesome teppan bar!  Huge menu and everything is excellent.  A little expensive but well worth it.   I usually get the filet and chicken combo.  They love sake bombs here so don't be afraid to ask!"}
{"text":"I've done take out but the layout of the restaurant is beautiful. I had a black widow roll which has cream cheese, soft shell crab, u ago and avocado on top.  This roll is just as deadly as it sounds and I am in love with it!"}
{"text":"Had the Yakigyu beef skewer appetizer. The meat was so tender. For dinner I had the combination Yakisoba. Very rich and delish! Huge serving, perfect for 2 to 3 people.   Skipped on dessert as they only offered flavored ice cream like green tea and strawberry. Had the Honeydew ball specialty drink, which was very tasty!   Last week I had the Beef Udon Soup. Absolutely fabulous!   Very reasonably priced. Moderately busy every time I come in, which is probably why the food taste so fresh!   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ohjah is a hidden gem around the corner of hualapai and flamingo. Food and service were excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes hibachi and sushi. Seabass came out really good-buttery and melts in your mouth. Scallops and chicken came out perfect too. The hibachi chef was very fun and entertaining."}
{"text":"Pretty Good Japanese restaurant with entertaining hibachi chefs. Unfortunately our chef wasn't the most entertaining, but the one who performed next to us did have some great skills and told some pretty good jokes as well as flipping the shrimp or scallops in customers mouths. The sushi is also quite good with a very wide selection."}
{"text":"Good food and clean place. Some of the staff needs help in the customer service department as far some of the waitresses. I've been here many times the food is consistent. Please work on the shrimp though and I can say the food can get 5 stars. The taste is off. Everything else taste great!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi restaurant. My fiancé and I enjoyed the night we came and we even got a free sake with our yelp check-in. The cook really put on a show and the portion sizes are pretty big. My favorite are the sautéed veggies and rice, but I also order shrimp and steak.   Im not sure if they have the white sauce that I am so use to getting at other Japanese Steakhouses, but I did receive a red and drown dipping sauce. The sauces weren't bad but they weren't as good as the delicious white sauce. I would defiantly return with my fiancé for a nice dinner date, but I will be sure to ask if they have the white sauce so I can dip my rice and steak in."}
{"text":"So, we've been here a lot, with my husband, our families, even with our daughter. It has always been a great experience, but today was special, I don't know what it was, our really good moods or our AMAZINGLY AWESOME WAITRESS, Blenda! She was so super nice and even though we bugged her for a lot of things, she was consistently really nice to us and I thank her for that, especially because my 2 year old made a huge mess(SORRY BLENDA)... but anyway the sushi here is THE BEST, and I stand by that, I love all their rolls, their miso soup, the appetizers! Everything is always perfect. So thank you to everyone! Thanks a bunch."}
{"text":"Went here last month for a friends birthday party in the private Hibachi room. The food was good. The cook was entertaining, however the service was not so great. Granted we had a lot of people in our party, but the attitude and service didn't seem appealing. None of our dishes were taken away once we were done to make room on the counter for our main course. The server didn't come around to refill drinks either. I understand trying to get everyone's attention to order in a big party can be a hassle, but still provide great service. You never know who will tip big based on service and drinks being refilled"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall, so parking was ample. We had a reservation for dinner to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary, saturday night. We got there early but were seated right away. It didn't seem too bad, for our time slot, but when we were leaving, there were people waiting to get seated. It's a good thing we had a reservation.  There is a coupon promotion (free appetizer) in the weekly mailed paper to area residents. Also, there is a Yelp promotion, when reviewers check in. You can use it or save it; it's nice to have that option.    Menu: Huge! (I checked it out before coming here- on this site (4.5 stars), and on their website), a nice variety including regular dinners, Thai curry, sushi rolls, Hibachi dinners (all of them are base plus the entree, separate pricing), as well as the Children's Menu (under 12). Portions are large. I didn't know what I wanted to order, but then again, that's a good problem to have!   Ambiance: Very nice, elegant, dimly lit, and clean. Tables seem more private because of the logo glass partitians. We were seated in the regular dining room section. The sushi chefs were in front of us in the same room (along the wall; all of them were asian). The other side was the Hibachi side (the smells were wafting down to our side; it also seemed to be the more popular room).   Customer base: Families (with children) and seniors  Service: Excellent service from our server, Hong (Darren), who was very nice, and when we sent the curry back (it was too hot for my hubby at #2), he wanted to make sure that the second time, it was just right. We could hear the manager speaking to him, explaining, except he almost sounded irritated that we sent it back. He was in the bar area, which was just across from our table, a few feet. I appreciated that Hong remained polite and checked in with us several times and refilled hubby's water (without my hubby asking).    We got the regular edamame appetizer, $3.50, the chicken egg rolls appetizer, free (used the coupon), the california roll, $4.95, seafood thai curry, $14.50, combination yakisoba, $12.95, and the kids teriyaki dinner, $11.95 (came with soup, salad, side, and stir-fried vegetables). Total cost of our dinner was $51.80, not including tip. The receipt shows suggestions for 18% (automatic for parties of 6 or more), 20%, and 30%. We even had leftovers!   I really liked the taste of the food, the curry was delicious (with added chili pepper sauce- I like medium spicy, in general), the yakisoba (the veggies had a nice crunch, not soggy or overdone) my soup (mmm) and salad (that dressing!), and the side of fried rice (our son didn't want it, but he really enjoyed the soup and the teriyaki chicken) were the standouts for me. It was also surprisingly generous portions. My hubby liked it more the following day, said the taste was even better the second time around. The quality of the ingredients was also something I noticed.    I also like the large menu, there is something for everyone (assuming one likes asian food, that is). All around, this restaurant is pretty impressive. And, we would come back here again, maybe even try the Hibachi next time."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place, they have the best fried rice when you do hibachi! I've been to multiple places but thus far they have the best hibachi in town! Everything is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. We always love coming over with the kids, it's like dinner and a show in one. Tonight, it felt like the kids outnumbered us big time with having two more families with us. The fact they're sto"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place and finally did. We sat on the sushi side, place was packed. Food was excellent and the service was awesome! Can't wait to visit again and check out the hibachi side."}
{"text":"I took the family out with my cousin and his family.  Second time here and it was great both times.  Good food and healthy - I prefer to order with light sauce.  Fun place to eat and talk.  We only sit at the grill.  I ordered the fish and liked it both times.  I recommend Ohjah."}
{"text":"Drove by here for a year and was definitely missing out.  Thought it was a basic teriyaki bowl place and I was wrong!  Very nice interior, lighting, service and food.  Plus it is very affordable.  The sushi was very good and the service is super friendly. Wide menu choices of traditional cooked Japanese entrees as well as Thai dishes.. At least 4-5 staff members stopped by to welcome me and make sure everything was good and it was.  I definitely recommend Ohjah and will be back!"}
{"text":"location is off Rainbow Road Tempura calamari is best - had assorted sushi, jalapeno tuna, tea.  assorted was good, but hands down the tempura calamari was the best selection for us.  tender, crisp, like a perfectly cooked fish steak.   assorted sushi was ok.  service was ok, prices were par.   maybe hibachi will be attempted, but not for a little while."}
{"text":"WOW! Finally I have found a Japanese Teppan steak house in Las Vegas that actually knows how to do it right! This place is my new hang out! Food was amazing! Be sure to check in and get a free Saki!! I had the filet mignon and it was like butter! Soft and tender and filled with great flavor! Eddy out chef was funny, entertaining and of course a great chef!!! I highly recommend this place! If you love Japanese Teppan, you need to check this place out! The meat was colorful and cooked to perfection! The salad dressing was excellent as well as the onion soup! Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food and service you receive! Can't say enough about this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and the staff is unbelievable especially Mary and Jack!! Mary makes the bar feel so great and comfortable! Jack ensures the whole place is welcome. Also, if you want hibachi table Sarah is an awesome server attending to you! Great neighborhood food and quaint! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Decent place for sushi. Nice decor inside and good service. They have a lot of options for rolls, which I like. If you like spicy rolls, try the Double Spicy. Pretty yummy. All the dishes are put on fancy and big dishes. Prices seemed decent. The menu is pretty big as they had Korean, thai and hibachi as well. The kimchee fried rice is pretty good. Good portion of it as well. There's also a sushi bar and televisions for sports games. It was just not very stroller friendly. We had to park our stroller in the corner instead of next to our table and put the car seat on the chair. A warning to the mommies and daddies, don't put your valuables in your strollers just in case. Also, you can get a free small sake when you check in on Yelp. I was surprised at this since it was free alcohol.  :)"}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Love it would come back again and would recommend for a good sushi place."}
{"text":"We love it here, and so does our daughter! We come here for dinner at least 1 night a week.   My husband and I always get the hibachi combo with 2 portion of filet, and one of calamari steak. The calamari steak is always cooked to perfection! The combo, plus an extra basic entree is more than enough food for two of us! And our daughter loves the salad!   Service is always great, too! They are so attentive to us and our little one! Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer for sushi both at restaurant and for take out.  Always good, staff very efficient.  The problem of late has been the very loud, and screaming, guests that go for the teppaniaki side of the restaurant.  It's getting very annoying to have to scream to the people across my table.  Not a relaxing atmosphere at all. Too many kids."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner but was pleasantly pleased. They have a full bar with high end/top shelf liquor. I can't say I've ever seen 1942 at a sushi bar but I respect it! Everything is super fresh and they have a huge menu with more than just your standard sushi rolls. Staff was attentive and the sushi chef was funny and entertaining. This is definitely our new sushi spot"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for the dead fishy's. 1st everyone is really nice. 2nd, the Sushi Chefs, Habachi and Kitchen all produce excellent food, so no matter what you feel like you can find it here. Also they have a real bar with real alcohol, not just beer and wine. Plenty of seating, and reasonably priced. I went here 3 times the first week I found it, now I think once a week will do."}
{"text":"Omg so good! Everything was fabulous from the chef's routine to the fresh food to the delicious desert and sake! I'd come here again. The filet Mignon we got was cooked perfect. We got the French kiss sushi roll which was some of the best sushi I've had in years."}
{"text":"This is truly the best sushi spot that I've found in Vegas. Th prices are really dope too."}
{"text":"This is a great teppanyaki place.  Always fun to have your food cooked at the table.  However, besides the show, the food is very good.   If you like garlic, the fried rice is excellent.   Usually get combo.   The shrimp and filet minion is the way to go.   The steak is very tender and delicious.   I've gone a few times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally! Best calimari in Vegas, and beyond! Huge, meaty, steak-fry-like logs of 'mari with a crispy crust like I've never had. Seriously amazing.   Hibachi was delicious. I was in the mood for some good veggies. The fried rice was great (he let me call an audible for extra garlic, and it was the right choice). The NY steak was soft, juicy and perfectly tender.   Service was perfect. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Very good service, fair prices.  Nice restaurant atmosphere.  Soup and salad were pretty good.  Cons:  Teppanyaki food and gyoza appetizer are somewhat bland."}
{"text":"I love that the new Ohjah location is so much closer to me! I can easily stop in after work because it's literally on my way home. I stopped by a couple times already. I used any old excuse to stop in like \"It's Monday\", \"I don't want to eat Super Bowl food for dinner\", \"I had a hard day and I deserve it!\". Let's go through my exciting food choices...shall we?   I tried their Japanese Spring Roll ($6.95). It is mainly some greens with fake crab mixed with the spicy mayo, avocado wrapped in a roll. It's a little salty for me so lately I've been asking them not to put the sauce on the bottom of the rolls . I'd rather have it on the side. I still love this appetizer and it's a bit addicting for me.   The Crunch roll ($6.95) is yummy! I like some crunch to my sushi sometimes. I like the sauce they sprinkle it with because the roll has that sweet and salty taste. The shrimp tails on the edges of the rolls are little tricky for me to maneuver around but practice makes perfect!   The Chicken Kat's plate ($11.95) was pretty big because I'm used to being served just one piece of chicken but this came with two! I had to take the other one home. It's a nice meal that will fill you up!   I wanted to try other appetizers besides the spring rolls so I tried their Kani Nachos  ($3.75). It a big fried won ton with crab meat , avocado and some sort of oil on top of it. I didn't care too much for the oil. It was tricky to eat so I did miss having the spring rolls.   I had the Pink Lady ($10.95) which is sushi wrapped in pink rice paper. This is my favorite one I have tried so far. It's not because it's pink but I like the mix of flavors in it . I think this one also has cream cheese . I love rolls with light cream cheese!  The Calamari ($7.25) here melts in your mouth! It's not rubbery or has a fishy smell like some places I 've been to lately. They give you generous meaty pieces . I think you get a lot for your money on this dish. I could barely finish the last one. This would be my number one appetizer and the spring rolls would come in  a close second.  The last roll I had was wrapped in avocado . I think it was the Shogun roll ($9.95). This would be tied with the Pink Lady because I liked them so much! It's hard for me to choose.   We also came here for Hibachi which is always excellent! They have a meal where you can choose three meats for around $39.95. I chose the scallops, shrimp and fillet Mignon. It was entertaining and delicious!    The service here is top notch! The handful of times I've been here they have always given me the best customer service by checking on me and making sure my drink is always full. It was an overall awesome eating experience for me!"}
{"text":"Habachi...... the worst I have ever had! The fried rice was terrible!! I love fried rice cooked on the habachi table and this was the worst ever..... the rice was not cooked well... it was hard and crunchy, and had no flavor at all! My husband ordered the Kobe steak adding on the live shrimp......and he was very upset. We have had Kobe steak at several restaurants and this was again the worst ever!!! IF it was Kobe it must have been in their freezer for several years and they defrosted it in the microwave. There is no other explanation for a Kobe steak to taste that bad. I had the filet mignon.... it was good. The live shrimp were good also, but you get one shrimp when you add it on to your dinner, yes ONE... so that was really the only edible part of my husbands meal.... ONE shrimp. If you go...... DO NOT order the Kobe steak and DO NOT get the fried rice.  I really recommend going somewhere else for habachi!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place. I usually get the same yellowtail rolls because they are awesome. My friend Mary and I come here every now and then and we always get the garlic edamame! YUM!  My last visit I ordered:  Blue fin tuna sashimi fatty tuna with green roll - it was on the specials board and it was darn good - see my photos Sweetheart roll  Love the ambiance, very cool decor interior. Extremely inviting atmosphere, fast friendly service. Prices are reasonable, no AYCE though but that's OK.   YAAAY"}
{"text":"My favorite hibachi place hands down! My family and I come here every year for Christmas Eve and I think it just gets better and better.   To start you get a cup of onion soup and salad. The dressing on the salad is delicious! A little bit watery at the bottom but still great.   For the grill side you get either noodles or fried rice, vegetables and your choice of meat. I had the scallops which came in huge portions and were cooked perfectly. I also love the noodles and advise those over the fried rice.  I can't say enough good things about this place, so good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent food and the service was excellent as well. It's located right on the corner of Hualapai and Flamingo. I think it is where Denny's use to be. They have a sushi bar, dining room, and a section with hibachi tables.  They offer a nice menu that's consists of Japanese dishes, sushi, and Hibachi style cooking. I sat at one of the Hibachi tables. It was the usual show put on like every other Hibachi place, but as always it was funny and entertaining.  The filet tasted just fine and it was cooked just they way I requested.  The sushi rolls were also very good.  As far as the appetizer menu goes, I would definitely recommend the Japanese spring roll and the super white tuna appetizer with jalapeños.  I noticed other items on the menu I would like to order such as; all of the udon dishes and the Sukiyaki for sure. I think I will be heading back there soon. Stop in and give it a go!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service amazing food. Just amazing!!!!!!!  Will only eat here when we visit Vegas"}
{"text":"We decided to try Ohjah for fathers day. We didnt have a reservation but the manager was awesome and worked us in for the Teppanyaki tables. We also had sushi and a few drinks. The drinks were very well priced especially compared to other Japanese restaurants that want to charge $12.00 for a martini. Service staff was friendly, attentive and fast. Manager was all over the place making sure everyone was happy. Teppanyaki chef was a lot of fun! Kids loved him. Nice portion size, very fresh sushi and just a wonderful atmosphere. If you live up in Summerlin you should really try this place out!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Love love loved the experience! Chef Teddy was amazing, it was my boyfriend and I first time here & we went for my 22nd birthday, would definitely come again with a group of friends"}
{"text":"This place has the best hibachi and sushi. Such a great place to bring guests. Great entertainment and great service! We've seen George Maloof eating here a few times which says enough. This guy could eat anywhere in Vegas and he chooses Ohjah! Just confirms that we have great taste ;)   Also Chef Eddie is the best!  Thank you, Eddie!"}
{"text":"The waitress was awesome and the restaurant itself was very nice as far as appearance and decor. Great wine list to choose from and the food was delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really love this sushi place! I am Japanese. My husband(he's not Japanese) loves here also. We are going there once a week so far. It's real sushi which I really wanted to eat all the time in USA!! Chef Kiyo who is Japanese and he always understand what we want to eat. We are always order \"Omakase of Kiyo\". After we met Kiyo, we don't need to go back to Japan to eat real sushi:)  The sushi which Kiyo makes is perfect. Hardness and balance of rice are splendid! We are always looking forward to what comes out next;) Thank you Kiyo-San!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome....seated very quickly.no waiting. Sonny our cook was friendly and funny. I did a sake bomb and the made a 7up with syrup for my son(non alcoholic). My 3year old cried during the fire parts. But had a great time. The food taste soooo goood. We will make sure we come again and again."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE! this is now my honey and i new fave spot . The food was wonderful the service was great and the prices weren't that bad . My bf even tried sushi for the first time! I forsure plan on going back ! The food was too die for !"}
{"text":"This place is my boyfriend and I's favorite date night restaurant (along with both our families and friends favorites)  Our favorite hibachi chef is Eddi and Charlie. They both add lots of garlic and butter to everything which makes the food even tastier. Tonight we got Charlie. His jokes and food never get old. I get double rice instead of veggies, shrimp or chicken(i got both tonight) and Charlie knows I still like the veggies so he gives me some at the end. Service was good, we did not have to wait that long for our table to fill and our chef come.   Always Highly Recommend the Hibachi here. I can go on and on about how good this place is, but see for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Yes, I'm starting my review with stating that this place was AWESOME!!  I was on vacay in Vegas, & a friend of mine works at Ohjah, so she took us for dinner here. She ordered this huge boat of sushi and sashimi that was soooo good! The sashimi (ahi, hamachi, salmon) was superb! It tasted SO fresh, and the sashimi felt like silk on your tongue! She also ordered a side of other types of sushi that tasted good too! But the ONE thing besides the boat of amazing sushi & sashimi that stood out strong in my memory was the green tea tempura ice cream! Omg!! One bite and I had a complete mouthgasm! It's superrrrr good compared to other places I've tried tempura ice cream! The vanilla tempura ice cream is good too, but the green tea stood out a lot more to me. It is soooo worth it!  Bottom line: I would recommend eating here. & I will definitely be back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhmazing! Can't wait to bring the whole Pham back. Great food, atmosphere, and service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing from the bar staff to the servers and chefs. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed. You don't always need a reservation but with a large group I would recommend it. They have multiple locations but Flamingo is my favorite. I always do teppanyaki with sushi as an appetizer."}
{"text":"When I was asked to go here for dinner I almost said no. The thought of any raw food just turns my stomach. I figured I should go because they have to have something cooked, right?  Well they did and it was GREAT!  I got to watch them cook my fried rice, veggies, and steak right in front of me (that was so cool).  It tasted wonderful, and I WILL be going there again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. The staff was a delight. Each one of them said goodbye!  Service was A++ food was B+.   The hibachi was a tad on the not as flavorful and rich as usual. Still it was a great meal and I cleaned my plate. Prices are very reasonable so are the cocktails!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Outstanding teppan meal and and service.  5 of us went for dinner this evening in the teppanyaki room.  We started with a sashimi assortment, edamame, cucumber salad, kani nachos, and tuna carpaccio.  All were fresh and excellent.  The hibachi meals were large, including soup, salad, rice/noodles and an assortment of veggies.  We went with a couple of versions of the Hibachi Combo which included filet mignon, scallops, shrimp and one of us had salmon.  My only negative comment is that the meat/fish were just a little bland, but acceptable. The servers were prompt and efficient, with plates removed and glasses kept filled.  Overall: one of the better hibachi places in Vegas, and it won't \"Benihana\" your wallet."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Monday around 9pm. It was very quiet, but that just meant a private table for us! I was surprised by the quality of the meat. Normally the meat is good, but not great at places like this. This place was great. The filet melted in my mouth like butter. The New York strip was cooked perfectly, and the seafood (shrimp and lobster tail) tasted extremely fresh. Friendly staff was a plus as well. This is my favorite hibachi place in Vegas now and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the hibachi steak and chicken. My husband had the hibachi shrimp and chicken. Steak was hands-down the best I have ever had at a hibachi place. Chicken was also up there. Very nice employees and a good presentation. Only complaint is that they do not have the yum yum  sauce they have at moat places. But I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered $120 food to go last week including a few appetizers, special rolls combo, and an Ohjah boat.  Everything tasted very good, server was friendly and helpful, but the rolls were the tiniest I have ever seen in my life! On an average the diameter of each rolls was no bigger than 1.25\", and that was including the fish, garnish or batter on top. The nigiri was like fun size snickers (without the wrap), and sashimi was skinny as well. To me their \"Sushi Dinner Special\" was nothing special when you compare the price and the size because the sushi rolls only worth 1/2 the regular menu price."}
{"text":"Came in waited awhile to get seated or even be acknowledge by a host of waiter..then once we got seated our waiter was in a rush I would have understand if the place was packed but it wasn't and we had an hour before the restaurant closes so not sure what the rush was about..food wise nothing special , ordered Tuna poke that was too chewy and soft shell crab that was too sogy and oily,now we did get a free bottle of sake for yelp check-in but that taste like crap too..I don't usually give a place a bad review but there's just no way of turning this dinner around..will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great ambiance......wonderful servers....fresh and delicious sushi menu....I love the salmon or yellowtail grilled collar for $6 and that alone fills you up ( it's limited everyday  and has the most tastiest part of the fish....YUMMY!!!!!!)"}
{"text":"So I am sitting here... First time ever, after passing by this place millions of times every single day and I am first greeted by my server with \"we close in 30 minutes\". This automatically puts us in a bad mood... We order a ton of food because we eat a lot, and this guy ignores all the nigiris we ordered because he thought it was too much for us to eat. I had to repeat the order of all the nigiris again (!!!) and assured him that we can eat everything (lol). I haven't even received the food yet but it wont make up for the bad service we've had already. I live close by and could've made this place a regular spot but prrrrrrrrr sorry guys. Actually the food just got here as I was typing this, and it IS pretty good. But still two stars.  Already edited review (minus 1 star) due to not being able to order tempura ice cream because kitchen is closed (before the actual posted closing time of the restaurant)."}
{"text":"The hibachi was drowned in soysause and really really salty. The soup that came with it was really MSG mixed with hot water.  I used the help check-in for free small sake, but our server forgot about it. When we reminded her half way though the meal, she came back with a half filled bottle and said that they're out of house sake (really? in a japanese restaurant?). She said that more is coming if we're willing to wait. Well, the meal was done and new sake stock was not in. Boo.  I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible experience with my family tonight.  We have been to this location at least 20 times and will not be back.  The cook was rushing through to get done.  We had 4 kids and he didn't do any tricks.  We had to ask for a couple to be done because the kids love them.  Also multiple food items were wrong.  Food was missing and was not as good.  Just not good service at all.  Waitress was nice and trying hard to make up for the mistakes.  Still a really bad experience."}
{"text":"Came in last Friday for the hibachi and not only was it great entertainment the filet was perfect the fried rice was good and everything else we tried was great . Definitely call to make a reservation on the weekdays as it gets busy."}
{"text":"This is my 5th visit in 4 weeks. Love this place! Service and food everyone is on point!"}
{"text":"Food was 100% okay. Not great by any means but not bad. Everything needed more seasoning. The chef didn't put on a show other than to spin some eggs; no fire or anything. The soup and salad are both quite good here.   The staff is nice and the restaurant itself is nice, though pretty tightly packed."}
{"text":"Very, very good Japanese food.  The beef sukiyaki is the best.  Excellent service also."}
{"text":"Great service! Great atmosphere! More than reasonable prices! The food was so good that we were stuffed and still ordered dessert. We will definitely be back! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Good Hibachi joint. Prices were reasonable, drinks were good. Flavoring of the fried rice and some of the grilled dishes could have been a little better."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff. Sushi and hibachi are both spectacular with a great price!"}
{"text":"Love this place.... Delicious Hibachi for a great price... Great service everyone is very friendly. The food is so tasty, I usually get filet Mignon and chicken. The price is great definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Place was good took my Daughrer for her bday. The chicken was a little dry but over all it was good."}
{"text":"The sushi combos are the bomb!  My husband and I shared a combo with three rolls are rolled out of there stuffed!   Our boys shared the chicken fried rice and the serving was large enough for all three of them.   Prices are very reasonable and the fish is fresh.  The service is fast and friendly.  You won't be disappointed.   We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ate here for a friend's birthday, and it was an awesome dining experience. The chef was so talented, I can't describe the tricks and skills he showcased preparing our meal. The portioning was perfect and everything was well cooked."}
{"text":"I had left a review for this restaurant back in 2014. I wanted to update it with nothing but great things to say. Ohjah is still one of my favorite places to eat. Even with the management change over the years everything still runs pretty smoothly. Chef Eddie is my favorite chef. His food is tasty and consistent! He pays attention to detail while entertaining! Even when I get a sushi craving I still go to Ohjah as apposed to other sushi restaurants because their sushi is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Not only does our 6 year old give it 2 thumbs up, but this has become a new family favorite to us! The price range is the best I have seen for hibachi, and the food is outstanding. Ali is our little one's favorite chef, he was great with kids unlike some chef's who forget they are cooking for an audience. We tried some different rolls, enjoyed the onion soup and of course loved the fried rice.  The chicken, filet and shrimp are succulent. The only thing to avoid hibachi style is the calamari steaks-ick and bland!  Another positive is that the wine/drink menu has an remarkable price point. My favorite glass of Sauvignon Blanc goes for double  the price at other joints.  Finally, the owners/managers want your business. They do what it takes to make the customers happy;a rare find these days.  Keep doing what you are doing, OHJAH!"}
{"text":"Kayla bartends on Tuesday.  Go then.    She is a delight.   Great sushi...ask Kayla to Show Me The Love ..the roll is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Boys love coming here. Always family friendly and staff is great!  Service is always top notch. Worth the wait if it's busy. Been many times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the yellowtail hand roll-SO fresh. The fish was excellent.   Staff was really nice and attentive.  We also got a dragon roll, it was good. The rice was a little wet but every ingredient was fresh.   My mom got the hibachi with scallop.. Scallops are HUGE. They were fresh just a little salty. It was her birthday and the chef made sure to give her special treatment the whole time. Pretty cool.   Dad got the hibachi with shrimp.. It's really good as well   Both parents enjoyed their food thoroughly. The shrimp were huge and plump!   I got the OHJAH combination with the hibachi entree and three choices. The steak, scallop, and shrimp. The steak was amazing. Chef asked how I wanted it cooked I asked for extremely rare and that is what he gave me. The scallops and shrimp were again really good. I should have gotten the salmon as I'm not even that big a fan of scallops but delicious nonetheless.  Refills were plenty and the only thing I didn't like was they didn't ask if we wanted dessert just dropped off the check. But staff was still nice.   FAR away from strip which is where we were coming from but worth it to not eat the overpriced mediocre food.   $102 before tip for 3 people for soda, beer, hand roll, unagi sushi, dragon roll, and the three hibachis.. At Benihana that would've been well over $150!"}
{"text":"We went for a birthday.  The server was very sweet, and the sushi was excellent.  However we went there for teppenyaki - the food was prepared very sloppily and wasn't as good as it normally is. It just seemed like our chef did not want to be there. Plus this was my view throughout the dinner...  Everything just looked and felt dirty. Ewww!"}
{"text":"The three combo sushi is a great deal, if you love meat get the cowboy has steak on it ! Yes I said steak on sushi! Who would've thought it would make for the perfect combination   Also hibachi is incredible and the show well worth it A+"}
{"text":"It was just okay. I don't like the way you order hibachi, if you don't understand how much food comes in an ounce you can be either getting too much or too little food. The food was nothing special either, not enough seasonings/flavor. It wasn't horrible but there are better hibachi places in town that I'd rather go to. Chef put on an okay show, he was pleasant. Restaurant was clean. But i doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night for my birthday dinner. Our server was really nice and made great food recommendations. I'm not sure if it was because it was just a typical busy night or because it was Presidents' Day, but no one had stopped by our table for about 30 min and we had to go and grab someone in order to ask for our check. We were helped by a man named Min, he's the reason we decided to give this place another chance. He not only took extra care of us until we were about to leave but he also brought out two desserts! Min stuck a candle in the tempura ice cream and sung me happy birthday. He went above and beyond to make sure we left happy. The food was delicious and so was the green tea cheesecake and tempura ice cream!!! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"When we pulled up outside to park, the manager was walking some patrons out while shaking hands and handing out promo cards.  He was cheerful and friendly and appeared sincere.   We got a table and made our selections, a couple roles of sushi, and couple of entrees.  The service was fast and attentive, coming by often to check on us.  Making small talk.  Our bill came and the prices are consistent with what we expected.  When we got up to leave, the friendly little manager just ignored us as we walked by, I was disappointed and thought he must of overlooked us, but as we went through the door, he did look up at us, so I guess we didn't spend enough to warrant a handshake.   The food was good enough on it's own to make a return visit worth it, perhaps with family coming in, we can make it."}
{"text":"Good food very entertaining chefs  wonderful bartender Mary she he is a great mixologist"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday it was absolutely delicious scallops amazing and fresh !!!veggies rice soup and salad all delicious!!  Salmon and steak great flavors all around staff very nice and friendly my seven year old niece had the best time she wants to be a cook now !! As a server and being in the industry very impressed they should give themselves a pat on the back well done !!! I will be back and bring friends"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and was very good, however not 4.5 worthy. The soup was ok, salad was good and tasty. We all had the filet mignon and I added the Calamari and my wife added Salmon, which was tiny bit over cooked, however overall both were excellent tasting. Service was great too. Final thoughts... a great place to go once in a while for the food preparation and live cooking"}
{"text":"I love going to Japanese steakhouses, ever since a friend took me to one for my birthday. Ohjah is super affordable and the staff at both locations are so nice and will cater to you. Definitely recommend going here, you totally get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary. It was so good! We have ordered the New York steak and the fried rice. I can't even tell you how amazing it was. And so fresh. Paired with a margarita  definitely will be back and the prices are reasonable for the environment you get.    I knocked off a star because when I sat down on one of their chairs a huge chard of glass poked my leg and made me bleed everywhere. They offered I believe 20% off. But it still was a little neglectful to not double check their seating."}
{"text":"Not much to see from the outside, but a very nice restaurant once you're inside!  The food is great and service friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Used to love this place . Now they have a new manager that is absolutely terrible ! Could not be more unorganized or rude ! Service is down in a major way . Eddy is still a great cook but it's just not worth going back . I called one day and was only asking if they had any openings . I knew it was a holiday so it wasn't a huge deal if they were full . Mr. RUDE manager man felt the need to tell me ..  it's a very busy day . You shouldn't expect a reservation . Umm , I didn't ! I called to inquire .  I told him we loved Oh Jah and frequented their restaurant at least once a week . I was just checking to see if it was possible to get 2 people in just like the old manager did .  Was told .. you aren't the only one who spends money in this restaurant ?!?  I told him I understand that but never in my life have I been spoken to in that manner .  I would suggest a different location ! This one has gone so far down hill! I don't see it returning to a great place while it's being managed by a Very rude guy .  Our last visit .. at the end when they flip the shrimp into the customers mouth to catch it .. my youngest wanted to try . I understand it wasn't intentional BUT my son was hit in his eye by the shrimp and it stuck there . Accidents happen but not even an apology . Within 2 days we realized my sons eye was closing and was super puffy . Took him to the ER and was told it was from the shrimp  because it was flung in his eye quickly and was hot . Idk but this has been a small nightmare and the restaurant doesn't  see anything wrong with what happened :/ .. ER co pay was $200 and medication co pay was $40 . That was a pricey dinner ."}
{"text":"I order few days ago 3 rolls my complain it's about the take out the rolls weren't made good and just 5 pieces in each roll fish fresh but must to work more on the take out"}
{"text":"First visit here celebrated a birthday food was great and the chef was amazing pariseth  was his name request him he's funny and has amazing tricks there was four of us and he made us all laugh louder than any of the big groups in the whole. Place ....so why four stars ? Because the server just wasn't great he forgot our birthday and messed up the salad order but all In all a great expieriance and I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Ohjah has sushi and regular dining in the front and a hibachi section in the back.  My 8 year old loves hibachi (can you say onion volcano) so off to the back we went.  I was very impressed with the friendly service and the willingness to accommodate (they made a deep fried California roll on request and answered all our questions.)  I especially like that they let you pick your combinations so you aren't stuck with something you don't like just to get the steak or lobster.  You pay a basic 8.95 for salad, soup and the table seat and then you choose your entrees ala carte ranging from 4.95 for chicken to 12.95 for lobster.  (prices may vary).  They also have a kids menu with large portions.    The show is the same you get at any hibachi place with our excellent chef making a rice heart, an egg roll, an onion train, fireworks and volcano.  I was impressed that the chef gave us all a shrimp toss and all but one of us who tried, caught it. (My daughter was too shy to try).  The quality was good and the chef cooked the steak perfectly. We opted for the fried noodles instead of the rice and they were excellent.  The rice looked good too.  Even the ginger dressed salad and the onion soup were very good.  The sushi roll was a little on the skimpy side but tasted very good.  The pricing was right, for two entrees, two drinks, the sushi, we spent less than 45.00.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our #1 Go to local spot for sushi! Jakk the manager goes above and beyond to make our dinning experience top notch EVERYTIME.  We come here at least once a week and Jakk greats us with his welcoming smile which makes you feel at home!!"}
{"text":"Where to start... First off, the service is fast and attentive. We were hungry and wanted to wait for our own hibachi table instead of sitting on the side of a party. So we ordered drinks and sashimi. The fish was very fresh and fell apart in my mouth. I can always tell good yellowtail and this was very fresh.  The hibachi dinner was fun. You may want to look the other way when you see how much butter goes into the meal, but boy is it worth it. Charlie was our chef and was very good at tossing the egg around without breaking it. Someone mentioned the salad dressing, yes, very good. With our hibachi dinner we ordered chicken, filet and calamari, all tender meat.  I can't decide which I liked better, the rice or noodles, so do what we did and order one of each.  All and all an amazing experience and delicious food. Will definitely be back(soon)."}
{"text":"This is the best Hibachi place in Vegas outside of the strip.  I've been coming here for 4 years now and nothing else compares.  The chefs are all good but our favorite is the head chef Eddy.  Great place to bring family and food has always been cooked perfectly.  Please @ me if you can find a better hibachi joint in Vegas - I don't think you will."}
{"text":"I want to be fair. I love the food here a lot. I go here a lot.. but it is becoming noticeable that the service is suffering. We tried to call for a reservation and the lady put down the phone and we heard all the restaurant commotion for 8 minutes. Finally I hung up and called back to a busy line for 15 minutes. We decided to then go to restaurant. We told them about the phone.. no sorry given and the audacity was that before taking us to the table she answers the phone, not once but twice. The irony! They need better staff."}
{"text":"So I don't usually like places that are like this, I find that more times they don't season very well. This is not the case here! As soon as we walked in we received a warm welcome and was promptly seated, just my husband and I. We sat at the hibachi table and very shortly after the table was full the chef came out. I loved that we really didn't have to wait around. I had the filet, scallops, and shrimp. Husband had chicken and scallops. We both loved everything, the scallops were very fresh and large. We also ordered a tiger roll, mehh I think I need to try another roll before I make my mind up on the sushi. The show was the best that I have seen, the chef was very interactive. For everything it was $70 not including tax, prices were good. We defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"After enduring many many advertisements at LVAC for 10% off for members we tried Ohjah's. Open until 11pm we made it in around 9:30 pm and were quickly seated. Our server was very friendly and offered excellent service. I opted for the spicy chicken dinner which came with miso soup and salad, nice. The salad was fresh and crisp but was overly drenched in the house dressing and was more like soup at the bottom. The miso was your traditional miso and nothing special. The main course of spicy chicken was perfectly seasoned and proper heat but again had way to much sauce at the bottom of the dish. The chicken was tender and veggies still crisp despite having a robust amount of sauce. Overall it was a decent meal with good service but nothing to knock your sox off."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to this place! The food is amazing. Ohjah is great for dates, family gatherings, or just when you feel like having really good take-out. I typically come for hibachi and am never disappointed, my favorite chef is \"Charlie Murphy\". His knife skills are out of this world and the end product he produces always tastes great. He is also very entertaining. The staff is friendly and welcoming, especially the manager. Everytime I come, whether with my girlfriend and kids or solo for take-out, he always makes sure we get a spot and are taken care of, with or without a reservation! Definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great price and fabulous food. The environment is relaxing and completely deceiving from the outside. You feel like you're at the strip rather than in a smiths parking lot."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and have not been disappointed. The last 2 visits, we have reserved a private booth for 4. It's quiet, personal and still get good service. They have a 3 special roll order which has many options and is plenty filling! The Grand Canyon roll is 5/5. If you are up for a challenge the sushi boat is a great option. My husband and 1 other person are usually able to finish it and they definitely do not go away hungry.  Great service and food with decent prices!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here with 3 young children who were tired and fussy the whole way there. Naturally they wanted McDonalds (yuck). Once we arrived, the hostess immediately seated us at the teppanyaki table and took our drink orders. They were promptly delivered. We then ordered a few appetizers which were also promptly delivered. By this time the chef at the table across from us started his cooking show and my kids cheered up! Shortly after that we placed our order and the show began. We had a great time as did our kids. They all want to go back now. We had a great time and the staff was definitely very attentive just as most of these other reviews claim."}
{"text":"It was NYE when I went, and most other resto's were closed. I had some high hopes due to all the rave reviews. Even the dude working next door told me this place had legit sushi.   Hmmmmm, me thinks otherwise. The waitress told me that the Gentlemen's Club roll was popular, so I got that. The rice was sticky in an unpleasant way, as though there had been too much water used to create the molds. I didn't like the flavor in particular.   Sushi nachos- with spicy crab. That was actually good. I'd order this again.   Wontons- they're cream cheese. Was decent, but it almost tasted as though they had bought frozen ones and stuck them in the oven to heat it up.   My friend had pork katsu which was breaded terribly.   Perhaps the teppan, or other items are better. I was a bit disappointed, granted, it was a very busy night. The coolest part is that the sushi chefs were both Japanese. Those are hard to come by lately. I watched them make the nigiri sushi and they were cutting the fish into extremely thin pieces. :(  I'm glad I didn't order them, since I woulda felt jipped at that point.  I'm giving some stars on here since the wait staff was amazing. Food, not so much."}
{"text":"The sashimi was so fresh. We ordered the black widow roll and amaebi/uni/toro sushi for appetizers and honestly so surprised at the freshness and quality. The teppan was amazing. We both went with the steak/shrimp/scallop combination hibachi cuz it was only $30... I'm a frequent benihana fan and the land & sea normally cost $35 before the fried rice upgrade... Seriously, my five stars don't come easy and I'm normally just a check in to get a deal, but this place was worth me leaving a review. Coming back again and again. #amazeballs"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars by no fault of their own. I haven't tried enough of the menu to give higher. We went for hibachi and I was rather impressed by their menu options AND more particularly the price point! This is a hibachi I could do with my kid and not come close to breaking the bank. I got the steak and fried rice. Literally the same show and portion size as you would get at Benihana.... Although I'm sure quality of meats will be somewhat different, not being a connoisseur of those types of things, I didn't notice and loved every minute.  I took advantage of the free sake with check in which doesn't give you the option of the flavored sakes but did let you choose between plain hot or cold. I also ordered a different speciality drink and it was good. They aren't a bar so I didn't expect too much in that arena, so I was impartial to it.   I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"If you like green mussels.....this is a must try  delicious  yum! So is everything I have tried there thus far"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We always make a reservation before going, but they always have open spots.  They are very efficient about getting people seated and getting everything to you quickly.  Getting in and out of one of these places in about an hour is pretty rare.  Their chefs all have great personalities and are really good at their jobs.  I've been here quite a bit and my food is always cooked perfectly.  They have a full bar, but its also a great place to bring the kids.  Prices are pretty reasonable as well.  If your looking for dinner and a show, I'd definitely check this place out.  They do have other locations in Las Vegas but this is they only one I've been to."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese Steakhouse and I've tried a lot on my lifetime.  I usually get the hibachi shrimp or hibachi fillet. This place also carries gluten free soy sauce and will cook yours first so you don't have to worry about cross contamination =].  FYI. The soup and salad that come with the meal isn't gluten free but everything else is."}
{"text":"It was midday and I was hungry so my girlfriend and I stopped by at Ohjah Ramen.  The establishment was beautiful inside, little dim but relaxed place with booths and still can hold a large accommodation with room to stretch a bit.   I ordered the beef ramen and my lady ordered their Ohjah signature oxtail ramen,Takoyaki and fried oysters.  My beef ramen just had that rich taste but it was thoroughly cooked on the grill.  Perhaps if it seasoned and cooked on the broth or quickly boiled in water then grilled it would pair with the ramen broth better.   The Takoyaki could use more tako in it and the fried oysters were fresh but had it been added with an onion powder or garlic with the panko crumbs ahh we got a winner here.   The female server was very nice, she made sure that I received the spices that I asked for and always was filling up our water glasses with a side of lemons.  I am not sure what my girlfriend had to say with her oxtail ramen as she devoured that but I think it was out of hunger.  I would have given a three and a half stars which I would say is more accurate.  If I am on the complex next to Freedom Firearms and I am hungry again it is a good chance I would come back. Ramen Kobo is just down the street hmmm."}
{"text":"We did the hibachi grill last night with the kids. It was really good. We started with a sushi roll which was fresh and delicious and not very expensive. Then we moved on to the hibachi food. We ordered the NY steak and our son got the shrimp. Both were very tasty and the veggies and rice/noodles that came with it were perfectly cooked and oustanding. We have a lot of usuals that we go to but this was a nice change. I might have to add this into our list of usuals. The atmosphere itself was really great, clean & modern restaurant and was dimly lit. I will definitely come back without the kids. (kids hated the steam and fire from the hibachi grill)"}
{"text":"As usual, yelp is the place to find the yummiest places to eat. Went here with my boyfriend for a casual dinner and we sat in a booth for just a normal dinner. The place is really nice and clean, and I really like the details they put into for the design.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly. She explained things to us about the menu items, which was very helpful. Also, she gave us suggestions on what to eat, which is pretty helpful for us first-timers here. She was very patient bcs we did take quite awhile to choose what to eat.   Finally settled and ordered and our food got to our table pretty quickly ! The pre-meal started with soup and a salad. & the salad was super yummy !!!! I really enjoyed it. It was light and the sauce was the best part. The soup was very simple, which was nice. We tried the onion soup bcs it was something new & different from the usual miso soup.   We also got the fresh half shell oysters ($5.95 for 3) and it was yummy ! I love oysters. Though if you're an oyster fanatic, there are better places out there than this. But I guess it satisfied my small craving.   When we got our food, we were so surprised as to how big the plate and portions were. It really fills you up ! The food was super yummy and looked amazing !!!! Like it so pretty. & on a side note, I was half way done with my meal, and I noticed something a little off, so I mentioned it to our waitress. She was really nice and sincere about the whole thing and brought her manager over to take care of us. He apologized and quickly got myself a brand new meal replacement. It was really nice of them and they weren't butt faces about it (unlike some restaurants).  Overall, we really enjoyed our experience ! Definitely will be back bcs the people there are so lively and friendly. They really do care about the customer and go beyond expectations. As for the food, yummy and fills you up ! Next time, we'll be back to try the sushi and the hibachi grill ! So until next time (:"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Had my birthday dinner before heading to our New Years party and everything was amazing from the moment we sat down. Food was delicious, excellent service and our chef Eddie was the best! Very interactive, and the same bombs!! Love love ohjah!!"}
