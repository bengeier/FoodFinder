{"text":"For a non-descript sushi ( And more!) Restaurant in a strip mall setting, the enormous creative range of rolls is of the highest quality and worth every penny. Add in drink specials every night, including Tuesday 99 cent sake night, and you have a labor of love, a little masterpiece of casual dining on gourmet quality dishes."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night date. Food was good and the prices were good too. I liked the teriyaki steak and the sushi was good too. My only concern was there just weren't enough smiles from the staff. Would be 5 stars but only saw 1 smile the entire time. That was troubling for me as I prefer to be smiled at constantly."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a new sushi place and this is it! Had a wonderful dinner with our family. Staff was friendly and attentive and sushi was extremely fresh. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Very good atmosphere - quaint, intimate but not a quiet library. Had the Spanish mackerel sashimi, Arboretum Roll and the Pink Blossom Roll. Could not have been better. 
Happened to go on a Tuesday night and 99cent hot sake carafe is dangerous. If you like sushi you must try this place."}
{"text":"Went on Presidents Day.  Restaurant was about half full and seemed to have a fair amount of take out traffic.  That said, it took them 40 minutes to serve our food and the food was luke warm at best.  The flavor was okay- probably would have been better if it was hotter.  Green tea served in cup with tea bag- not too authentic.  They asked how our food was and I mentioned that it was okay but luke warm.  They just said thank you and walked away.  Disappointed- we will not be back."}
{"text":"I came because it was close to home and because people i knew have been before. I expected it to be good with 4 stars, but oh was i wrong. I got the spring roll and the eel roll. The spring roll was okay, it was small but but the sauce was good. Definitely not worth $6 for 2. The eel roll on the other hand was not as okay. It was small and there was hardly any eel in it, again, definitely not worth $6. My friend got the bojangles roll (we shouldve known it was bad in the first place) and it was absolutely terrible. The fried chicken with rice and avocado did not create a good taste at all. I ate 3 pieces and just got full from that. The only good thing i can say about the place is the service. We got our food to go, and the woman took us straight to the menus and and ordered in maybe 5 minutes. The food took 10-15 minutes to make, but it was expected. Overall, it was not a good experience, and im definitely not going back."}
{"text":"We love Sushiya! It's close to home at the Arboretum and they always have fresh sushi. The hubby and I go on Tuesday's when they have .99 saki. Tried the majority of the sushi roll menu and haven't been disappointed and prices are right!"}
{"text":"On Friday June 9th 2017 at 7:00 PM my wife and 8 year old child with autism and high sensory problems among over issues and I came into your restaurant.  We sat down and after a waitress came over to clean our table that has served us many times left another waitress came over and told us we would have to leave because my son had McDonald's chicken nuggets with him.  They didn't allow outside food in their restaurant even though we have eaten many times before without issue. I then informed the waitress that my son had an extreme case of autism that he can only it just around 5 things and he throws up almost everyday because of his stomach problems she still made us leave. This is the only way we can ever eat out.  He is still in diapers because of his problems. Life is hard with a child and family that have these everyday problems. My wife and child went to the car. My wife was crying when I decided to come back in and inform the manager of how wrong they were for doing this to a family with a disabled child.  The manager asked the waitress if she was told by us that our child was disabled and she said yes. The waitress said to the manager you never told us that made a difference. The manager said each case is different.  The manager said we could come back in but my wife was crying.  Plus after being embarrassed in front of everyone and my child crying because his mother was crying we would just have to go back home. People who don't have children that suffer everyday can't understand how hard life is for parents to just simply go out and get something to eat. My son had been sick and throwing up for three straight days  and well one. He wanted to go get McDonald's since nuggets are the only thing besides pizza he will eat. I don't know how many normal young kids eat Japanese or sushi but it's your right I guess so you can try and sale your food. May want to revisit that policy. I wasn't wanting anything free. I just think after knowing you made that mistake. Embarrassing my wife and child and making them break down in a car. I would have thought you would have at least offered to come out and apologize to my wife and child. I just got a sorry. I just want you to know who it was that is leaving a bad review on your restaurant and why.  I don't want to hide behind a website.  I sent you an email so you would know who did this. If anyone has a child with similar disabilities and want to eat here make sure you call first and make sure your welcome. The whole restaurant watched us get told to leave without knowing why.  Being a human I wanted to explode but being a past Captain in law enforcement I knew I wouldn't be the right thing.  This place needs a heart.  And feelings maybe try and catch people at the door. I had the bag and drink in my hands. This was a very bad day for us anyway. My wife just wanted to be like normal people for 30
Minutes and eat and leave. After being such a great mom to a very sick boy she came home and ate cereal. My sons teeth have been destroyed by body acid he has been so sick in his life. But I guess it is more important to try and sale sushi to an 8 year old rather than let him eat what he can since he is 1% on his weight scale.  But hey, you said sorry inside."}
{"text":"I've never had sushi before, so when my friends recommended we go out for sushi on New Year's Eve, I was a bit apprehensive. Sushiya Japan is located in the Arboretum near the second entrance off Providence (the Qdoba/Chili's corner). I've seen it multiple times, but it never really registered to me.  

When I entered the building, I was surprised at how nice it was. Hardwood floors and dimmed lights made it appear very upscale and trendy for being in the Arboretum. It was mostly empty except for two couples at side tables. Our drink orders were immediately taken and it only took a few minutes to get the drinks. We then ordered our food. I, and most of my friends, ordered the California Roll sushi. It was super affordable at $4.25 for eight rolls. The presentation was gorgeous and the service was ridiculously fast. Our waiter was so kind and constantly checked on our drinks and food. I found the sushi to be okay. I've never had sushi before and I'm not a huge fan of anything that is in the California Roll, so that's probably to be expected. My friends, who have had sushi before, both liked and hated the California Roll. The salads were delicious and several other foods that were ordered by my counterparts were really great (meat dishes). My final bill (for sweet tea with tons of free refills and the California Roll sushi, with tip included) was around $8. 

Overall, the great service will have me going back to Sushiya (tonight, actually). I'll definitely try something different next time, but this place is pretty good for the price. Definitely a standout in comparison to the other eateries at the Arboretum."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years and really love their menu.  I love their Spicy Beef Bulgogi bento box.  I also adore their rolls from the dynamite rolls to the flashy playboy roll.  Even my picky youngest loves their \"plain\" rolls. (plain nori with rice roll)  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great find near my hood!  I met my book club here for it's last meeting.  Our leader and her family order take out here quite often and she suggested we dine in while discussing our latest book.

Service was excellent! We were all served complimentary miso and ginger salads for a bit of a wait, and our rolls and food was beautiful as well as delicious.  I chose the Leaning Tower roll after deciding between several choices.  The menu at Sushiya is quite large.
All the of the entrees were beautifully presented and several people got the Playboy Roll, mentioned as a favorite by other Yelpers.

The atmosphere is low key Asian with the focus on the Sushi Bar which includes a flat screen slide show of all of the specialty rolls.  

What a gem for the Arboretum neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great good.  Very authentic food.  Atmosphere was clean and modern with Asian accented pieces.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"On 11/8/2012, I decided to order take out. I purchased 3 rolls, they were all very good & fresh tasting. Sorry I don't remember the name of them. But for the most part I would definitely  recommend this place to my friends. I plan on going back. I will write another review on my dine in experience."}
{"text":"My family likes the bento boxes that gives a lot of tasty condiments for a good price. Like the Kalbi bento is a lot of stuff like tempura, rice, vegetables (hey, it tastes good), dumpings, sushi or roll and the nice and juicy Kalbi (or rib stick) that makes your mouth water. The waitress are nice and gives goo service. I can't wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"My wife and son and our grandkids all went to Sushiya Japan after church services.  Everyone was very happy with the food there.  We also had three friends go with us.  The Bento Box was very good.  I liked the sushi, so did my grand daughters and they are very picky eaters!  The service was a little bit slow and they seemed a little bit unorganized.  The young man who waited on us was very nice but a little bit on the slow side.  He said we had all come in at once, but we were almost the only party in the restaurant!  I still liked him, and the food and we gave him a nice tip for his efforts."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite sushi in town, and has quickly turned into my go to sushi place. More consistent that Sushi 101, cheaper than Pisces, and better service than Cowfish. They use some good quality sushi (the sashimi always tastes fresh) and their rolls are really tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here a few weeks ago, and have been back four times. The Sushi is great, we loved the playboy roll and the girls night out roll. Can't wait to try the bento boxes. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Coming from D.C. we weren't sure we were going to be able to find a sushi restaurant that would match our expectations.  We were blown away by Sushiya and feel so fortunate to have found it.  From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and attentive.  The interior is decorated beautifully, soft lighting, and although the dining area is open the noise level is low so we were able to have good conversation.  The overall feel is casual, but tasteful.  Onto the sushi.  We had Tuna and Octopus Nigiri, the Godzilla roll, Spicy Yellow Tail roll, their Halloween Specialty roll and the Rainbow roll (not pictured).  The presentation was beautiful and the taste was excellent.  If someone in your party is not a fan of sushi or if they are allergic to fish the menu is quite extensive and seems to have something that will please everyone.  We cannot wait to go back and I am looking forward to bringing out of town guests.  Thank you Sushiya for a delicious evening!"}
{"text":"I am a sushi LOVER! so I am fairly hard to please and I love this place. The ambiance is nice, the staff is friendly, and the sushi is fantastic. On another note; Bulgogi is not an easy dish to master and it's one of the best I've tasted. It's son the Providence side of the Arboretum so it's not easy to see unless your looking for it. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first time eating here. It's a just a bit pricey depending on what you get, but I think it's worth the cost overall. The service was great, and the food arrived in a timely manner. I ordered the BBQ Kalbi Bento box, which I absolutely loved. It also came with miso soup and ginger salad, along with the other sides in the Bento. The meat was delicious and there was a bunch of it as it didn't really had any bones except for one large one. As for the assorted nigiri, the cuts of fish were thick and tasty. I was very satisfied with my Bento box meal, and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Decided on Sushiya when our first choice had a long wait. So, so glad we did. Everything was absolutely delicious! My daughter enjoyed her hibachi chicken. The miso soup was excellent. The gyoza was fantastic. The beef bulgogi was flavorful and the sushi was fresh and wonderfully prepared. Everything about our meal was fantastic including the service!  We will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Charlotte has definitely grown enough to finally have a decent variety of Asian restaurants. It's surely changed since the 1980's when \"Tokyo's\" was the only Japanese restaurant available. 
 Having said all that, my hubby and I spontaneously bolted out late Friday night and landed here for the first time and we are so glad we did!
 Huge selection and variety are found here, I must say! With many sushi rolls and sashimi from which to choose, you won't leave unhappy. 
 A favorite of mine now is the bento box that my hub ordered which has your choice of meat and includes the following:
soup AND salad AND tempura AND rice!
It's very tasty and generous. 
I ordered the grilled chicken salad that was very flavorful, even though there was nothing but lettuce on the salad. I also ordered a sushi roll, so I was more than happy when finished. 
 Plus, it's nicely decorated, friendly and very neat and clean. 
 Last, but not least, the waitress was incredible and, as I mentioned, it was late but, her smile and service were as fresh as that awesome meal!"}
{"text":"This place is a storefront restaurant, and average impression at first sight.  We have tried many many sushi places in Charlotte, most are disappointing.  This place is officially our go-to sushi joint.  Always fresh, always a place to sit.

Yes, we went to Oku as well- the food is excellent, the music too loud, and the price too high.  Sushi-Ya beats the pants off Oku all day long.

If sashimi is your thing, go squid, salmon, snapper, and escolar.
If rolls, try the amazing dancing dragon, pink blossom."}
{"text":"As their website touts - this is THE best sushi in Charlotte. Everything is freshly and carefully made. Even the to-go orders are neatly packaged and well presented. 

The price is equivalent to the value and the menu has options for the daring and timid sushi lover. 

5 stars given for great value, reasonable cost, good customer service, delicious food and a very clean/welcoming establishment."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  We always get the vegetable tempora because its hard to find good vegetable tempora.  It really is outstanding!  The house made ginger sauce on the salad is amazing as well!  Sometimes the service is a little... non existant.  Had to wait a while to get the check. They brought boxes and we waited about 15 minutes after that for the check. There were only 2 other customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast service. Good food. Quiet environment. Mostly japanese customers ( which is always a good sign)."}
{"text":"Incredible BENTO BOX!  This variety but absolutely complete dish is amazing and fulfills every taste bud and Asian food desire you will ever have!  Kalbi and bulgolgi were the best (Korean) of the teriyaki chicken and steak which were very good also. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very tasty fusion cuisine. The hibachi meals are good, but the Korean BBQ is my new favorite. The servers are reasonably attentive and the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte from Las Vegas a year and a half ago and I can FINALLY say that I found my favorite sushi place! Quality sushi with a wide variety of fun rolls to choose from, thank you Sushiya Japan!"}
{"text":"My first time here. My mom was Japanese. I'll see if they can hold a candle to my mom. At least they have a good health score!

Service is reasonable; the sushi chefs are businesslike but friendly and have fun messing with each other as I sat at the bar; food is pretty good. 

Nigiri was absolutely fresh, almost melted in my mouth. You could bite right through it in three pieces if you wanted. Takoyaki was okay, almost not cooked in the middle but still reasonable. The taste reminded me of the ones my mom used to make.

Their bento box is plenty big enough for at least one meal for sure, probably two. Their Korean bulgogi was tender and tasty. Tea was lighter than typical for an Asian restaurant (tea bags not loose tea). Green tea ice cream was basic, but good after months of being cooped up inside from winter weather and rain!

I wanted comfort food and got a good dose of it. You need to come check them out when you're in the mood for good Asian cuisine.

All the chefs were good. Ask for Jesús, their Salvadorian sushi chef. He was very nice and accommodating, friendly, and kind and a very good sushi chef!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  Restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is relaxed.  I got the bento box with hibachi chicken.  So much food for the price!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to come on my lunch break! I always try a new fried sushi  because I'm not a huge fan of the raw kind..but I have loved everything I've tried! The service is speedy and good..nice chill atmosphere around lunch time!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so many years to find this place! I love the sushi and the staff is always so nice and inviting!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Egg rolls were awesome.  Green tea ice cream was tasting unexpectedly good !  We ordered it against the suggestion of our server and still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We just so happened to walk around this shopping center and on a cold day, we wanted some miso soup. The atmosphere was very nice, large booths to sit in, and the waitress was very knowledgeable with the menu. We came in for lunch and I ordered the bulgogi. In my opinion, IT IS THE MOST FLAVORFUL, TASTY BULGOGI I'VE HAD IN CHARLOTTE! My $10.99 dish came with rice, salad, miso soup, 2 potstickers, about 5 pieces of vegetable tempura (onion, sweet potato, squash, carrot) YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also deliver within a 3 mile radius! You won't regret this place."}
{"text":"After an initial, very disappointing sushi dinner  at an expensive restaurant in the Southpark area, I had despaired of ever having a good sushi dinner in Charlotte, NC. Coming from LA, my standards are understandably high. I was, however wonderfully surprised by the food at this incredible gem of a restaurant. A friendly wait staff and excellent Sushi Chef made for a most enjoyable and delicious dinner experience. I will definitely be visiting this wonderful restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi restaurant got shutdown for a no compete policy. We tried this place in hopes that it'd be a good replacement. Our expectations were exceeded! The sushi was very fresh and looked as beautiful as the quality. We received our five rolls in under 15 minutes! That's very quick for Saturday night at 7pm! The server was very friendly and not overbearing. It would've been better if she understood English a little better. The atmosphere was casual and not very busy although I think the rain kept folks inside. Overall, great experience and we will surely return!"}
{"text":"First time I go to this one, but it is deff a fav now. We were a group of 5 who went last night, were immediately seated and everything seemed clean. There's a TV screen that is constantly playing their specialty sushi which I thought was cool. The waiter was really nice, he gave us all samples of a salad. The miso soup I have to say was just okay since there was little to no tofu in mines =/ but it was really tasty. 
I ordered the crazy crazy roll, mind you I don't really like fried sushi, but this one was delicious. I always eat my sushi with extra spicy mayo, but I have to say this didn't need it. My boyfriend had the Panthers roll and that too was spicy and delicious, It all tasted really fresh and was beyond good. It was all a bit pricey, but it was definitely worth it. 
The only thing I'm sad about is that it's far from where I live. Regardless I will deff be returning here abs will possibly drag some friends here as well"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised! Friendly service,  really good sushi. We never knew this place existed until we were shopping in the Arboretum and decided to try it on a whim. This is our new go-to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch.   Bento box was the best I have ever had.  Sushi was fresh, miso soup good, tempura wonderful.  As good as you will find in Charlotte.   Server was nice and efficient and the restaurant super clean."}
{"text":"Was busy so we were encouraged.  Meh.  The deep fried rolls were good - and some of sushi platter items were nice.  But some were not nice - like pull out of your mouth not nice.  Fine atmosphere for a suburb strip mall joint. Friendly staff.  Prices are high for what you get.  I mean if you're jonesing for sushi it will work - but don't get your hopes up.  The food we got at the price we paid wasn't worthy of 4 Yelp stars.  4 star staff, 3 star atmosphere, and 2 1/2 star food?  Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The salad dressing is really good and the miso has a hearty mushroom flavor. Prices are very reasonable. The nigiri is dirt cheap. Some pieces are $1. Hibachi entrees are under $10. 

Note that they do use a lot of rice in their rolls, so it fills you up. They had a vast selection of maki and they were better than I expected.

Service was a bit spotty. They are friendly, but we did have to ask for things more than once or twice. 

I would definitely return when I visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I hate giving bad reviews but I had sushi delivered from them and the fish didn't taste fresh AT ALL! I know what good quality sushi is in both low end (New Zealand cafe) and high end (Yama) I used to love to go to ru sans whose gone down hill and this was even worse than that. I'd really love a refund because the food was really awful.  The lettuce one the bottom of my seaweed salad was mostly filled with brown edged lettuce. Definitely not fresh lettuce."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was poor. We'd heard good things so we were optimistic. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Close to home...check.  Not over crowded...check.  Great service... Check.  Good food... Check!  My husband and I decided to stop in for a quick lunch.  I'm so glad we did!  There was a bit of a lunch rush but the service didn't suffer because of it which was awesome.  My only negative which many may be okay with was the extensive 'fried sushi roll' options... I just don't understand it but hey they have other options.  I had the sashimi bowl which was delicious and complete with a quail egg on top.  Yum!  My husband enjoyed his fancy roll(the name escapes me) but all around it was good and I would return.  Okay I lied, there is one other not so positive mention.... I ordered a lunch special which came with miso soup.  The miso soup was brought to me in a cup(which was fine... It was a lunch serving) but the cup wasn't even half full!  Did someone get hungry and help themselves to it on the way to table?!... Weird but overall tasty food.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great service, awful food. I've had Japanese food way better than this, the fried rice tasted very weird..kind of as if it was cooked with Wasabi. Only good thing we had from there was the gyoza (fried dumplings) and the customer service was very good. Oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross. Nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls. Really wanted to like this place but sadly never coming back :- ("}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars except there was a little inconsistency in the food between visits. 
     I've visited this restaurant twice and both times we were quite happy with the food. The service has been great and the restaurant is clean. I've had the panko appetizer, shrimp and vegetable tempura, Thai roll, crispy California roll, and the crispy Japanese bagel roll. Everything was on point and tasted fresh. The only small complaint is that the Thai roll was slightly overcooked on the second visit and looked a bit sloppy. 
     This is our new go-to sushi place since one-u bit the dust and Osaka doesn't have shrimp tempura (it's just shrimp coated in panko breadcrumbs)."}
{"text":"Decided to venture out last night to find somewhere new for Sushi, as we have tried a ton of places over the past year, so last night was all about searching for a hidden gem so to speak.  As we embarked on our quest, we ended up near the Arboretum, and as we drove through the parking lot, we were amazed to find a whole new section of the shopping center that neither of us had even known existed.  

We were shocked to see a row of restaurants representing all different cuisines from standard American fare like Chili's to Chinese (Cherry Blossom), quick Mexican (Qdoba), Asian (Malaya Kitchen), Breakfast (Le Peep), to many others...As we both mocked each other for not knowing about this \"bizarro Arboretum\", our eyes simultaneously came upon a Sushi restaurant called Sushiya, so we chalked it up to fate and decided to venture inside to give it a shot, as you shouldn't go against fate right???

As we entered the unassuming storefront, we were greeted with a huge welcome from the staff, a la Norm from Cheers, and the hostess/waitress said we could sit wherever we liked.  Not much in the way of ambiance, as there was a small Christmas tree at the front and a few assorted decorative pieces scattered about, but we weren't there for the decor, we were there for the sushi, so we didn't mind at all.

To put it mildly, the sushi menu is HUGE..about three pages worth of \"house rolls\" and \"specialty rolls\", and no pencil and paper was provided to mark selections, so it was a true test of our collective memories to keep track of all the various rolls we wanted to try, since we have nothing to note our choices on.  After multiple times through the extensive menu, we settled on a total of 6 rolls so we could try a little of everything.  Solid value on some of the specialty rolls by the way, as a lot of places these days price most of their specialty rolls in the $12-$25 range, but Sushiya had some creative rolls under 10 bucks, which was a definite plus.

The server was friendly throughout and did a nice job of making sure to ask if we wanted our waters refilled before they even got down to 1/2 full.   She was around just enough without being overly intrusive on our meal, and she was personable enough without being irritating if that makes any sense.

The sushi was fresh and overall I would say that 4 out of the 6 were hits while 2 were misses.  One of the misses was just devoid of flavor, while the other was overly drenched in a sweet mango sauce that was just too much in our opinion.  The hits were all solid but not spectacular.  I would say overall the sushi was better than what we found at Koishi, 18 Asian, Liu Liu, and other similar places, but a notch below some of the selections at Nikkos, Cowfish, NZ Cafe, etc.  

Definitely solid and worth a trip to check out for yourself as this place to me would be the definition of a 3.5 star yelp selection, but I decided to round up to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3, because of the variety of options available from a specialty roll perspective.  Again, if you are looking for decor and ambiance, this probably isn't the right place to find those things, but if you are looking for a solid place to get sushi on a Saturday night that you can walk into at 7pm on a Saturday night, get a table of your choosing, and not spend triple digits for 6 specialty rolls, then definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Came in for a quick bite to eat before going back to work and service was incredibly quick and the food was terrific! I got the Dragon roll and the eel roll. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very attentive staff. Delicious and fresh seafood. Highly recommend!  The playboy roll was very tasty and a good option. Good place for a date with quiet and casual restaurant"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi that isn't overly expensive. I would, however, suggest having a jacket with you when you come to eat here. It's a little chilly"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! We  attempted to eat here, but left after they would not serve the onion soup instead of the miso soup with the combo.   Menu says  \"soup\", no particular type.   I asked what kind and was told miso only, onion would be additional 1.95.  Waitress said I could double rice, but no soup change.   This makes no sense - onion and miso soup are the same price on the menu.  Good luck getting/keeping customers with this rationale.  The place was empty when we got there and when we left. ...no wonder.   One star because  zero wasn't an option."}
{"text":"I've now ordered takeout twice and found the food to be consistent, fresh and I like the fish to rice ratio. Other places like Pisces in midtown fill their entire rolls with rice for their profit margin. 
The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because they left a Philly roll out of my first order. I called and a server credited my card back for the roll. Simple human error but it was frustrating not having the complete order. At least they corrected their mistake."}
{"text":"It was good. Of course it's different when you take it to go. It was 29.00 for two rolls of sushi. The service could improve."}
{"text":"10 patons in the entire resturant, slowest service ever.  They must actually go catch the fish."}
{"text":"I love this place some of the best food I've had the sushi menu is vast and offers some variations you will not find anywhere else service is always good if you live in the area do yourself a favor and check them out"}
{"text":"Delivery was before the ETA so that's the reason for 2 stars. As far as the food. We ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables. Was not impressed AT ALL. Every piece of meat was flavorless, the shrimp looked like it was just soaked in butter and the vegetables were extremely bland. The rice tasted like it was something you would get from a instant rice package. Did not taste like hibachi at all. & for the price and portion, definitely not worth it. I've had better hibachi for $7 at Hanako in fort mill with triple the amount of food for half the price. Sushi might be good, but I don't eat sushi. Stay away from hibachi plates."}
{"text":"It really irks me when I have to give a business a bad review, especially when I don't think anyone at the business is purposely being bad.
I had no intention of eating at Sushi-Ya Japan, but I couldn't find the restaurant I had wanted to go to, and it was getting late, and I was getting very, very hungry.  

On the night that I went here, it was pretty quiet.  There were about only three other customers.  I mention this because the service was really, really unprofessional.  No one was rude, mean or anything like that.  It was just that the wait staff appeared to be untrained, young family members of the owner.  They didn't know what to say, and didn't know how to interact with the customer (me).  One female server actually wore what appeared to be gym/running shorts!  This is fine if it's a Hooters, but I wasn't at Hooters.

When I was done with my meal, I had to flag down one of the servers, after waiting and waiting and waiting.  The four or five servers had all congregated around a cashier/POS system, and were all busy doing something that seemed like socializing.  They all seemed to be brothers and sisters perhaps, and I felt like I was intruding on a high school social group.  

When someone finally brought me my bill, there was no \"thank you\" or any other acknowledgment.  I really don't like conversing with servers (I'm a pretty private, quiet person), but I do expect a professionally trained staff.

As for the food, the noodles were ok, and the sushi was dry and awful.  Never was offered a refill on the Coke.
Tip to management:  hire professional wait staff, or train the ones you've got."}
{"text":"This is my new sushi place in South Charlotte. The service was great, quick and very friendly. The food was delicious! We had 4 sushi rolls and loved each one. They are also very affordable compared to other sushi places near by. I can't wait to go back and try other items off their menu. They had a wide variety of items and they also deliver."}
{"text":"WOW! We accidentally found this place and I'm so glad. For a Japanese restaurant, they had the best Bulgogi I've ever had. I think this is my new favorite place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place. Consistently delicious. We come here almost every Tuesday. Can't beat the great food and .99 large sake"}
{"text":"We've tried several things there and all have been fabulous! Even my 10 year old is happy there. The waitress we usually get is fabulous.My son's favorites are the Thai Roll and Veggie Tempura, and mine is the Playboy roll. Highly recommend! It's not the BEST sushi place I've been to, but it's good."}
{"text":"There is a same restaurant under the exact address listed under sushiya japan. This is a duplicate."}
{"text":"We looked up Japanese and nearby for something different and I have to say, we were blown away! The food was amazing, service was courteous and very quick and friendly, something that we did not see at our normal Japanese restaurant which is why we decided to change.  The food was spectacular, the Playboy roll was out of this world and was so good, my entire family has a new roll.  I am half Korean so when I ordered the spicy Bulgogi, the meat was not the normal cheap and fatty stringy meat you see at many Korean restaurants but were tender and chunky high quality beef with a great but not too spicy marinade that went far for taste yet was still very hearty and savory.  The vegetable Tempura appetizer was very crispy and not greasy with great flavor.  Again, the magic is the high quality of ingredients.  This is now our new favorite Japanese Restaurant."}
{"text":"We eat here at least 3 times a week it seems.... Hibachi vegetables and brown rice, so delicious!!


And now they deliver which makes it even more amazing  

About to order some right now"}
{"text":"This is a family owned Japanese styled restaurant and it is simply delish. I'm there twice a mouth and never disappointed. The service is friendly and very accommodating. It isn't that big so in the evenings and on the weekends it can fill up quickly. Great for date night or family time. I'm a fan. The parking isn't bad but it is surrounded my other eateries so it can be a little confusing finding it. Great place"}
{"text":"This place is unsuspecting, but the sushi is amazing!  Every roll I had was incredible and fresh.  Definitely my new go to for take out in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place. So far the best sushi, I have had in Charlotte"}
{"text":"The food is alright. But the service is horrible. I ordered tofu and the waitress came out with fish. I kindly explained that I didn't order that dish and she just stared at me and walked away. Even though the fish dish sat there at the table untouched, she ended up charging me for it. If I wasn't vegan, I'd eat the dish. I got uncomfortable with the waitress so I told another waitress about my situation. I thought everything was going to work out but the waitress returned and chastised me for not talking to her about it even though I did in the first place. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by randomly and boy was I surprised! After looking at the deep menu I noticed they had Korean BBQ!!! I promise you if you order the Bulgogi you WILL NOT be disappointed. Being a lover of spice I ordered the Spicy Bulgogi and it was so great!

I also have to mention the egg rolls real quick. Legit the best egg rolls I have ever eaten, hands down.

Somehow a random stop for dinner quickly became a favorite spot! Will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and I am happy I did. The store front and decor are completely ordinary, but don't be put off by the lack ambiance. My waiter could not have been more pleasant and yet not overbearing at all. He greeted cheerfully and invited me to choose a table.

I received a complimentary salad of crispy fresh lettuce with ginger dressing. A tasty treat to start. I ordered a spicy yellow tail and spider roll which were both well made and tasty. The rice was done perfectly and the sauces complimented the rolls nicely. 

The price was very reasonable. My lunch with salad and two rolls was $ 14.42.

I've been looking for good sushi in Charlotte and have not been able to find it too often. Today, I did. A definite keeper. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here last minute for dinner. I didn't even really know this place existed and I go to the aboreteum a lot! We got sat right away. Our server was very nice and friendly. She answered our questions and gave suggestions. 

I started off with the shrimp shumai and it didn't disappoint. It was good and fluffy. I got the udon soup with seafood. I was surprised at how large it was. It was filling and good. The only thing I noticed was that the broth was super thick, very similar to a sauce. I couldn't finish a lot of it. I took the rest home. My friend got sushi and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place tonight. I had Tempura Shrimp appetizer, Tempura Roll and Shrimp fried rice. The rice was just OK the other two entrees were excellent. Wife had the Panko Fish appetizer, Seafood Soup and a Tiger Roll.  All was good, will go back."}
{"text":"Always ordered takeout and I always order Spicy Tuna Roll bcos its my all time fave... This place has the best Spicy Tuna I've ever tried ... I inhale this stuff bcos its so good... and then I get sad bcos I eat it so fast, I didn't get to savor it enough... and also, for once, the Spicy Tuna is actually spicy!!"}
{"text":"I ordered online using their new delivery service. It's important to note I've never eaten here before other than this particular time. Based on my experience I would not order from here again. I ordered teriyaki chicken and mandu soup. The teriyaki chicken it's self was okay but I didn't like how the fried rice was cook. It had a weird orange color that I wasn't used to (tasted overcooked as well) and the vegetables had no flavor but was soaked in watery sauce. The good thing about it though was that I was able to drown it in shrimp sauce, which made me able to enjoy the food more. The mandu soup was the most disappointing part out of the meal. The dumplings tasted very soggy and old (I could tell because the dumplings had dark residue all around them). Also the soup was extremely salty. I had to add water to it to eat it. I gave this place two stars because 1. there isn't many places around here that deliver other than pizza  2. The chicken was okay and shrimp sauce was good. 3. food came around the time stated"}
{"text":"Shrimp yakisoba was good, steak and shrimp hibachi was good, though the steak was slightly bland. 

0 stars for service. Didn't get water until we asked, had to remind them about our appetizer and then it was delivered AFTER we finished our entrees. I asked for it to be comped.

It's Friday night. Staff appropriately, y'all."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and was excited about how close it was to the house and all the good reviews. We ordered takeout and the fried sushi roll was soggy. The hibachi chicken was that greyish, dark meat chicken and the veggies looked like a freezer special! The price was way too much for this below average food. The only thing worth consuming was the sweet tea and shrimp sauce! Never going back!"}
{"text":"I accidentally discovered this little gem while doing errands at The Arboretum yesterday...and am so glad that I did!  They had an extensive menu, and some great lunch specials too.  I ordered their lunch special on Katsu bento box, which included a salad (with the ginger sauce that I love so much!) and a miso soup (very small, but very good), and a super-generous selection of items...which even included fried dumplings (a true rarity with bento boxes).  Basically ALL this (just check out my pics) for just $12.xx!  Although I have a big appetite, I couldn't even finish them all....though they all tasted absolutely delicious.  BTW, I also appreciated the fact that their menu also included some Korean items, like Bulgogi entrees (even a Bulgogi Bento Box) and even a famous Korean drink, Soju!  Although they weren't crowded at all, they seemed fully staffed in the sushi station...and the waitress was quick and courteous (though she seemed to be in training), with the hot, freshly prepared food being delivered to the table within minutes!  The restaurant itself was fairly typical looking, and not as stylish and swanky as some \"hot spot\" Japanese restaurants in Charlotte, but the food more than made up for it.  Since I happen to do a lot of errands around The Arboretum area, I think I may have found a place I'll be revisiting time and time again."}
{"text":"What a place. My wife and I came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky. 

We showed up early as it was an early day all around for us. This place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back. Now for the long wait until next time."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience here.  I had never been and wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.  But it was good!  It was very slow on a weeknight, so we got to order and get our food quickly.  All of the food was good.  I liked their miso soup and ginger salad a lot.

The prices are decent.  The customer service was good.  I don't live in this area, or I would come more often.  I would recommend this to anyone in the arboretum wanting to try something a little different."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this sushi bar. I order take out online. I found the website fantastic you customize almost any roll. The add ons were great. Food was ready when I arrived and"}
{"text":"Had the sushiya roll which I didn't love. Tempura vegetable appetizer seemed small. Waitress started to irritate me with how many times she asked if we were done. Brought the check before we were even done eating. Felt really rushed to leave (Friday at 8:30pm). Left feeling disappointed and like I didn't ever want to come back."}
{"text":"Pretty great sushi! Highly recommend the Ladies Night Out Roll, it was delicious! I would've given them 5 stars if not for the higher price tag. Been to places just as good (if not better) that were not as steep. Still, great food so you can't really go wrong with this one. Service was prompt and friendly too!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and expected something special or at least good. Ordered five different rolls, a couple of appetizers and a hibachi box. Everything was good EXCEPT the sushi. Didn't taste fresh at all and the flavors were very muddled. Difficult to tell one roll from the other because none of the fish tasted as you would expect. Hopefully the rest of the year is better than this."}
{"text":"Love this place...

I always get the bulgogi bento box and it never disappoints...

I went there the other day and they've updated the décor and place  has a fresh new look...

I hadn't been for a while and it was really nice that the waitress noticed!!!

I have only ever had great service there and love how friendly they are..."}
{"text":"This is the place I can have Korean style spicy seafood soup(jjambbong)! It is good but I wish there were more seafood in it. Only squid and clam in it. We ordered sushi& sashimi combo menu. It was fresh and delicious. Also enjoyed their drunken lobster roll. 
Whenever I visit there, their complimentary salad and homemade ginger dressing is part of the reason I come back here!"}
{"text":"Had a great time , the food was really good. Had a chance to have the pleasure of the owners daughter and she made great recommendations and they were all great. A must if you wanna try a new place"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new sushi spot, but was somewhat disappointed with the experience. First, I was the only customer, during my entire dining experience..which somewhat scares me. I was seated and served a complimentary salad. The salad was good, but overdressed..crazy overdressed. I ordered the onion soup and egg rolls. The onion soup was basically broth with a few onions, but no real onion flavor, which is what I was hoping for. As for the egg rolls, can I say frozen.
Onto the sushi. I chose a roll based on the waitresses recommendation, however it had a mango sauce that was so overwhelming I sent it back. I was not offered anything else and was charged for the roll, $13.95, after eating only two pieces. I questioned the server about being charged and she expressed the fact she told me what I was getting and I ordered it. Whoa, was I surprised. I expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do. She disappeared and came out with an older women. Upon returning to my table she did remove the roll, but was very unpleasant about it. 
Although I appreciate the fact they removed the roll, but was not impressed otherwise and will stick to my other favorites."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, and never had a problem with the sushi, but I ordered a regular shrimp tempura roll, and I got so sick! I know it was the roll because I didn't eat anything all day. I will \"never\" in my life eat here again... Ugh"}
{"text":"I just had such a bad experience here. The employees were extremely rude, the food is overpriced and mediocre. Don't even get me started."}
