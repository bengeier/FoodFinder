{"text":"We love this place. Fresh and delicious meats are always available and when we don't feel like cooking we pick up some food togo.  We've even had them cater a party for us and everyone loved their food. Will definitely Keep returning."}
{"text":"Place is great. They have good deals on food that's already made like carnitas, carne asada, chorizo, etc. The service is great there. I recommend it if your planning to cook out or if you wanna buy something already made ready to eat."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for great tasting Mexican food. The tacos are huge and only need three to fill me up (I weigh 200lbs). Overall, a great place to pick up Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place has the most excellent Mexican food. Don't come here if you're looking for a typical Mexican restaurant. This is a butcher shop. The meats are super flavorful and tender and they cut it up and served with some fresh tortillas and fantastic salsa. The servings are huge and 2 tacos  were probably almost a pound of delicious meat."}
{"text":"This place has the best carne asada,  tortillas,  Verde salsa , guacamole,  rice, and beans.    Check it out and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"I went there this morning for the first time, my friend recommend it and I'm glad a did.  I bought carne asada combo that is 3lb of carne, tortillas,  salsa, beans,  and rice. $21
The carne was so good!!! I definitely came back  again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Had their pastor burrito which was huge and they aren't stingy on the meat part at all! I also tried out their pork gordita which was amazing! Even their red salsa sauce was great! A lot of places tend to have sauce that are jst too sour. Rice and beans wasn't too heavy on the salty side at all. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow this place is changed a lot since they went in now they have hot foods to go all prepared the carne asada tacos are fantastic"}
{"text":"Finally was able to give this spot a try!  I drive pass it daily and it smells so good when you pass by and see them cooking the food. 

Man oh man was I impressed!  First off, the hours on here and on their website are wrong. They are open on Saturdays and I believe Sundays as well. I went around 630pm on Saturday it and was slightly busy with people in and out.

I ordered the carne asada burrito. It only took about 3 minutes for them to get the meat that was already cooked and make the burrito. It was STUFFED. I could not finish it all. I literally have half of a burrito left to eat. The flavors were AMAZING!!  The burrito only has meat, beans, and rice but that's all it needs. They have homemade sauce at the cash register that blended so well with the burrito. You can get red or green.. or both!  

Please don't hesitate to give this place a try. It is beyond worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting their Carne Asada combo for the longest time. I first tasted their Carne/Salsa at work. My coworker usually shares with us because the meal is HUGE. I asked her for the address and she gave it to me but I misplaced. However, I knew the location where to go but there was many shops in the area that were listed under \"Mexican Food\" on Yelp. After some time, I finally found their shop and I was super excited. I ordered the Carne Asada combo which includes three pounds of carne, plenty of tortillas, salsa, a pint of rice and beans all for $21. Serious $21? That's such a win for my appetite and wallet. They definitely have a returning customer."}
{"text":"Was nervous that there were so few reviews, and I typically like a lot of reviews prior to visiting a location. I was very impressed. Had the Carne Tacos and they were amazing. It will not be long until this place is on the radar. Hot sauces were excellent as well. Will be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Good deals on Carne asada. We always buy it cooked. So tender and full of flavor. They have great specials too. Always more than enough and we are big eaters."}
{"text":"I had a carnitas torta. It was big, looked and tasted amazing. I would definitely come back. Service was a bit slow but worth the short wait."}
{"text":"This is probably by far the best mexican super market out there. We've had carnitas, chicharr√≥n, barbacoa, y popusas. Se la rifan bien cabron lo que es. Como estar en mexico al chile"}
{"text":"Best carne asada I've had in Arizona! The meat has a great flavor and is very tender! Definitely my go-to place for carne asada!"}
{"text":"Lord Jesus! Bless the hands that prepared this food! OMG! The absolute best Mexican food I have had. The carnitas are super tender, and the chicharrones are to die for!!!!!! Oh yea and the tortillas, the tortillas taste like heaven! YESSSS Carniceria Los Amigos! YESSSSSSS! lol"}
