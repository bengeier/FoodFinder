{"text":"For anyone who may be feeling like they're in a rut of eating the usual burger and fries, the 5pc cevapi (like a more flavourful cheeseburger) and potato burek from the take-out section at the back of this deli made for a really nice change of pace.  They were $6.99 a piece, but the portions were enough for two meals.

Have been driving by this place for years, and just got in the mood today to try something new.  Wish I'd been feeling more adventurous a lot sooner - the food was delicious!

Would have liked to have tried some Balkan soup if there had been any available.  From the pictures on the menu it looks like they may have had some in the past, at some point?"}
{"text":"Small. Very Eastern Europe, the real deal.

Deli store and  almost hidden area for sit down comrad eating.  It's anti hipster. Love it.
Roast beef sandwich is spectacular.
Will come again.

Decor like an old Montreal convenience store."}
{"text":"This a small Bosnian delicatessen that also has a fast food sections that prepares their authentic ?evaps (minced meat sausages) and hamburgers. Everything in this place is as authentic as you can get. They make their own meats that you can buy fresh or frozen to BBQ at home. They even have authentic desserts that are rare to find anywhere else in the city.  The owner is usually there and the most friendly. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall deli.   I had to head up the DVP the other day, and traffic was bad, so decided to zip over to Vic Park.   On the way, I saw \"European Deli\" with a sign for \"burek\" in the window.   I know Burek as Borek, which is a common dish in Turkey.   I had a meat burek, which is kind of like a coil of sausage wrapped in an oily dough.  Yummy!

There's also a large selection of what I believe are Macedonian / Balkan products and a dining area in the back.   They also have a big selection of porky items: sausages, bacons, smoked meats, etc.   Well worth a stop for a break if you need to make the journey up to the 401."}
{"text":"Yummmm for grilled mince meat sausages. 

When you first walk in to Maks, it is a small grocery store, with some dried goods and a largish deli counter with a few fridges/freezers. Now, what you really want to do, is make your way to the back of this deli and find the small sit down area, the flat top grill is sizzling away. I think the place only seats about maybe 15 customers at a time, but they do take out, so no worries there.

If you're coming here to grab a hot meal - you should be here for the Cevappi, which are a ground meat sausages made with veal, lamb and pork. The sausages come in 5 or 10 sausage on a bun, with cream cheese spooned over the sausages, so the cream cheese is softly melting over them and with a side of chopped red onions.

Price wise look for it to top out around $12 for the 10 pieces of Cevappi on a bun with the \"fixins\", one you start eating these, they are seasoned and I normally don't like lamb, but because of the mix of meat I am unable to detect the lamb from the other meats, which can be a good thing, if you're like me and don't like how grassy Lamb tastes.

I wouldn't look too much in terms of customer service, but you walk up to the cash register after you finish eating and pay, there is a fridge for drinks, if you are eating for here, and you just grab your drink and settle up the bill after you finish eating.

Overall, this place isn't bad for grabbing a quick bite with no expectations for service. I'll probably stop by here, if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I've had a few dishes here but the Cevappi is by far my favourite. If you're looking for an inexpensive, tasty and filling meal, check this place out. It's no fine dining but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Some real comfort food for me I loved the 5 piece Kabapi with some onions and bread was delicious!! The cheese masnik was also amazing just like my wonderful baba used to make back in the day. Service and staff are super friendly and very nice people u will feel right at home. And instead of going to the danforth and supporting the greeks let's support more Macedonian run places and show ppl we have some amazing food too!!!"}
