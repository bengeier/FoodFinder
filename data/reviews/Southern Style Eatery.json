{"text":"I love this place and eat here often. If I could only eat/drink one thing for the rest of my life, it would be their Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and Sweet Tea, it's absolute Perfection! Mildred and her crew as as good as it gets! Louisiana Style hospitality!"}
{"text":"This place reeks of awesomeness.  I love the 3 pc fish with the fried okra and mashed taters and gravy.  Smothered Chicken is a great special as well.  I get soul food for my body and also spiritual food for my soul inside.  The good Dr. Is on the speakers sometimes and I enjoy it.  My Grandma made a mean fried okra back in the day and I love the okra here.  Both are made with the same special ingredient....LOVE."}
{"text":"\"Down home\" Southern hospitality & Seasonings .. this is our 1st time here...recommended by a friend. Great food & Great prices...we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am so HAPPY that my wife found this place. I had the great pleasure in meeting Mr. Fred, nice guy. The way he prepared, and made this delicious food and with the seasonings is a delightful experience. This may be \"a hole in the wall\" place. BUT you taste buds WILL thank you when you take that first bit. I had the shrimp po boy. The shrimps are a nice sive with lots of flavor. We will be visiting your establishment several times a month. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"If you like catfish you better make the drive to see the folks at Southern Style Eatery ! Their fish is bomb, top that plate off with greens and yams and you'll experience true Southern taste. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The fried fish is done perfectly and the shrimp PO-boy was excellent. Sides were good. The sweet potato pie was good but the crust did not seem homemade. Service could be better but everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Really tender moist meats. Prices are fair and service is wonderful.  We will be back soon.   I had hot links chicken and ribs. ...next time I will have the catfish.  It looks delicious."}
{"text":"Their cornmeal batter is everything ! The fried jumbo shrimp and the oysters platter is the only thing I get and have tried since I found this place. I need this platter at least twice a week.  -Shrimps are really jumbo  -Oysters are clean and not briny! Love that!  OMG to the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been here a few times and are never disappointed.  I always get the catfish, which is amazing, especially with the dipping sauce and my husband always gets the chicken wings which he always smashes.  The sides are good too and always have to get a peach cobbler to go for the kids. Great place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to the old location frequently. The best catfish that I have ever had. Seriously. My husband always gets the chicken wings and he loves them. All of the sides are good and I love the peach cobbler! Will keep being a loyal customer at this new location too!"}
{"text":"Didn't even know this place was down the street from me ! Glad I do now though!! I ordered catfish , which was AMAZING . the Mac didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for but the fish made up for it . And they deliver . Found the new spot for a fulfilling meal ."}
{"text":"All I can say is MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm! I love this place! I called ahead & they welcome me with warm hospitality & great food at good prices! No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service.  They don't even answer their phones. They don't receive online orders, and when you go into the shop, they are nasty. Worst service I have ever received in Las Vegas. Don't bother with these dirt bags."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best chicken tenders I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the batter was well seasoned. The mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese made great sides. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Such nice people!"}
{"text":"The food and the people are great...I get the chicken fingers made fresh...not frozen seasoned.. And great amount for the price...the cook is funny and..always glad to see you.....nothing like getting your moneys worth..."}
{"text":"Had this place yesterday for dinner. The fish poboy is so good with candied yams and greens!! So good"}
{"text":"No tap water here... They give you complimentary water bottle I love it hate tap water..  And food is delicious :)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them through grub hub. The order I placed around 6pm was supposed to be here  between 7:15-7:25. At 7:45 pm I tried to call them, but all I got was a busy signal. I had to go through grub hub to get ahold of them.  They said they got stuck at my gate, but no one called me.  When I finally got my food, it was all very soggy. Fried jumbo shrimp looked great, but they were so soggy, I couldn't eat them. The mashed potatoes and gravy were all together and was more like a soupy mess than mashed potatoes and gravy. The Mac and cheese was good, but cold. The po boy bun was such a soggy mess, I couldn't eat it. The best thing I got was the collared greens. Maybe this place is good if you go in, but I think I would stay away from delivery.  Oh, and it didn't come with any sauces for the fried shrimp. Not the best experience for waiting an extra 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Forgot to review last time,  about to order again!  Sooooo yummy! ! I'm actually excited for our food to get here!  Last time they didn't include any extras we requested,  and were getting close to closing so they didn't want to do some items. These are normally deal breakers. The food weer got was so delicious,  definitely going back for more,  and hoping that in the future (and not shortly before closing)or order will be even better! !"}
{"text":"One of my co-worker's referred me to this place, and I would not go back again! Service was slow, and there were only two people working during peak hour lunch time. There was a long line and the lady just kept walking by everyone, didn't say I'll be with you all in a minute, nothing! Finally she took my order, she had an unpleasant tone, I ordered the 6 pc shrimp plate, it took 45 minutes before my order was ready, the shrimps were over-cooked, it was so not what my co-worker was ranting about, and I wouldn't recommend their service unless you are prepared to wait all day!"}
{"text":"Place was delicious.. catfish was cooked perfectly. The guys who run the joint, really seem to know there stuff... will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was real good.  Catfish-yummy.  Mac n cheese on point.  My kiddo was happy with chicken tenders and fries.  And banana pudding was yummy.    Not sure why people complain about places and customer service.  I feel u come there for food not for someone to kiss ur ass.  As long as my order is right I'm happy."}
{"text":"Worse dinning experience ever! When we first entered the restaurant we were told the cook was not there, he had to run an errand. The owners mother came in and cooked our food. The fried snapper was salty and the macaroni and cheese tasted like kraft macroni and cheese from the box. When we went to pay for the  meal we handed the owner the mobile restaurant.com coupon and he would noy accept and stated coupon must be printed out. My family waited in the restaurant until  i returned with a printed copy. I showed the owner the copy of the restaurant.com coupon which indicates restaurant  owners can  call to  validate coupon. Owner stated \"I could do what I want in my restaurant\"  I said true but I can write a review of your reataurant and my experience.  Then he called me an ignorant black person threw my credit card at me and told me to write that in my review.  He gave me the check to sign  and I threw it at him in the same manner he threw my credit card at me and left. The owner chased me out the door as if he was going to assault me. Then he yelled thats why I spit in your food.  Do yourself a favor and go to M&M Soul food.  The service is excellent.  The food was a 5 star and customer service was also 5 stars and it is close to thw vegas strip."}
{"text":"Boy on the all mighty cook they throw down if you haven't been here yet you don't want good soul food. Bomb.com"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jem! We have had other places that are similar and they don't stand a flame! That's included with a fancy restaurant. The location is low key you do have a choice for take out and dine in. I myself got the fish salad and man oh man the fish literally melted in my mouth! The flavor was just right! I know what your probably thinking that it's probably a typical fish salad. I would tell you it is anything from typical. It's pretty big to!  My fiance got the fried fish and wow the fry on is is light not heavy the fired fish we usually get is either to much fry or dry. Not this fish it is so moist with a lightly breaded outside! Yum!! Everything on that menu is so good! You can tell it is real home cooking!!!  The staff is really friendly good people! If your ever in the area I'm begging you  to take a peep in. You will not be disappointed. Looks like this is our new go to spot!!"}
{"text":"Okay, i took one for the team here.  Was in LV on business and had a craving for catfish.  Based on Yelp reviews I went to this place - it is a long drive from town and when I arrived (about 1:00pm on Wednesday) there were no customers... bad omen but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  First, this is not a restaurant, as such - it is a fast food joint where you order at a high counter from a big menu on the wall.  Food is brought to your table in Styrofoam containers,  I had catfish, chicken, green beans, and red beans & rice.  the veggies were tasteless except for the odd (dishwater?) aftertaste.  I thought they would be better with salt so i got up and looked for salt - I figured that with 11 tables, there must be salt somewhere.  I found the single salt shaker in the room and used it - honestly, it didn't help.  To their credit, the catfish was not bad - nothing to rave about and certainly not worth the drive but not a bad taste.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and I suspect most of their business is due to people giving them the benefit.  I can only conclude that the five star reviews are from owners, friends, and family but not from legitimate customers.  Even though the catfish was not bad, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We used to be consistent customers.  The food has always been pretty good though inconsistent in portion. Orders have often had items left out and sides often are not matched to the order.  Yet, we hoped it was the result of growing and that the problems would iron themselves out.    Suddenly, the doors were closed every time we stopped. So, we gave up until recently.  We were told it had new owners, so we've given it three more tries.  Tonight marks our last attempt to give our support to Southern Style Eatery.    Somehow, the person answering the phone believes she is doing us a favor by taking our order. I was hung up on once then told \"It's alright\" when I called back and said she must have accidentally hung up. She started taking my order then, suddenly, someone else took the phone, so I got to start all over.  Her voice was deadpan and she seemed quite irritated.  Not once did either of them say \"thank you.\"  In fact, she ended her side of the call with\"alright.\"   We've overlooked a lot but rudeness will not cut it. Tonight was the third strike out.  I suspect the doors will be closed again soon unless these two employees learn some people skills and appreciation for every customer that comes through their door."}
{"text":"Thanks guys - everything was on time and still warm...The the taste was great"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the fish, rice & gravy, & yams. Tables and chairs were a bit wobbly. Restaurant was clean. They did not have fountain drinks only cool-aid & water. I'd come back."}
{"text":"update.....  we have been to this place several times and each time we love it.  we start trying new things everytime we go.  well we tried the greens and yams and omg!!!! they were absolutely delish!!!!  everything always.....always....come out fresh and hot!!!  the fish is great, huge shrimp, and my favorite fries always good.  seasoning always perfect and love going here."}
{"text":"just at here... Yelp directions were wrong....but we found it anyway, and so glad we did... enjoyed the catfish and added a side of shrimp.   my husband and I split the 6 pieces  of catfish and have to say, that is the best catfish in town ... awesome, the shrimp were big and plump...  we will be back again ."}
{"text":"I got a mailer for this place and figured I would try some Southern Food. This place was far from perfect. I was there the other day and tried chicken tenders that were decent but not great, and a grilled pork chop that was ok but too dry. Red beans and rice didn't really have much flavor, and cole slaw didn't seem fresh. It is super cheap though, so I wasn't really complaining.  I gave it a second chance because it's nearby and I'm sick of every other restaurant around; Plus its so cheap that I figured it was a minimal investment to at least see if there was anything worthy of making it into the rotation.  I have never been so glad that I gave a restaurant a second chance. I tried the fish, grilled and fried, and I couldn't even say why I tried it. I have never really liked cooked fish. I love sushi, but I don't have near the same feelings for even very high quality cooked fish. For whatever reason, I was in the mood to try the catfish here, and it was seriously life-changing. I've never had a grilled fish fillet before that was this good. The fried fillet was good too, but the grilled was simply out of this world. I spent my whole life thinking I didn't like grilled fish. As a sushi fan I've given grilled fish plenty of chances, and always was disappointed. I've had grilled fish at American Fish and Mastro's, and for $6.50 this was head and shoulders above any other grilled fish I've ever had in my life. It was seriously so unexpectedly good that it makes me feel like I need to evaluate what else I might have been wrong about.  I think this place is still working a lot of kinks out of the system, I can't say I've really enjoyed any of the sides I've gotten, and after my first visit I really could not believe the 5-star reviews of this place. But the fish was literally beyond belief. I did not know that a catfish fillet could be that good. Like I said, this place is far from perfect, and some of the issues are things that would normally cause me great concern, but this fish was so good that I'm not sure there's anything I wouldn't let slide. This place has to be by far the best value of any restaurant in Las Vegas. Try the fish. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"You have to know what to order here: the grilled fish and mac and cheese. You have to know what to expect here: slow but earnest service in a no-frills location, inconsistent price to quality ratio.  The grilled fish is great- it's cooked with a vegetable mix and is well seasoned. A four-piece combo includes two sides for a mad-cheap $8 not including drink. Mac was a great side, creamy and cheesy even if it was served out of an aluminum pan then microwaved, which made me question how fresh it was.   The grilled shrimp salad though? Skip it. $9 portion is half of a takeout box, and other than the lettuce and tomatoes, the veggies on the salad are grilled, which I found bizarre. Shrimp was plentiful (7 pieces or so?) but sadly overcooked and rubbery. Italian dressing was mostly oil. If this is their usual execution, they should remove this dish from the menu altogether.  Service is slow- waited over 20 minutes for a takeout order. Kitchen seems a bit unorganized and inefficient. Orders are placed at a walk-up counter, dine-in meals are bought out in Styrofoam boxes.  But the guys working here are making everything to order, and are friendly to boot.  Subtracted an additional star due to an issue at the register: for some reason their computer was unable to read my card and needed to be entered manually. Worker had me read my card number out loud with expiration date, a huge violation of privacy and a security risk, in order to do so. Did not feel comfortable at all with this."}
{"text":"In all honesty, 5 stars is not enough to rate the quality and taste of the food. The fried catfish is wonderful. Add collard greens and yams you will be in soul food heaven."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but it's a total joke. Waited over an hour for service for two. The dining room had two other diners and a couple of people for takeout. The food was incredibly disappointing as well. I had the six shrimp combo. Over cooked and dry. Never going back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a few co-workers recently. Venue is kind of out of the way tucked back in a strip mall. Upon 1st entering there's the counter with a register. We assumed we ordered there & they would bring the food out to us. After they asked if we were picking up or dining in they mentioned we should go sit down in the dinning room to the left. Food is great here. We ordered various items (see pictures). I am not a catfish fan but I tried a bite of my co-workers & I was wowed. It was nice & crispy with cornmeal batter. Not greasy at all. I will have to get that next time we go back. My co-worker that got the fried chicken said that it was good but a little salty in the crust. Service needs some work. Gentleman just stood at the end of our table when we sat down not saying anything. I finally mentioned that we'd like some drinks since we were all still milling over the menus. Service over all was slow & if you're on a lunch hour you might want to phone in your order ahead of time & pick it up. Unfortunately it's too far away to travel during my lunch hour (ended up taking us hour & 45 minutes) but I will definitely be going back for dinner time for the food."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised food was extremely hot very well prepared and very delicious we will continually go back and their okra and catfish are to die for. In the corner of buffalo and alta NE corner. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is worst I ever had experience... THe A/C was broken how the hell they think I wld eat in hot as hell inside the building it was happening last few weeks ago... I stopped by again to get some fish for lunch around 1 pm guess what? They won't open Til 3 pm because nobody work there?!?!?! Whoever is running this business ... Get ur shit right!!!!"}
{"text":"Had this place on a Saturday for the BBQ ribs special. Everything was great. Mac n Cheese was good, could have been bigger. The ribs just fell off the bone and the sauce was great. My bf had the shrimp po boy and enjoyed it as well. We took it to go but they have a big room for dining in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Worth the wait. Just order a fried turkey for Thanksgiving my mouth is already watering."}
{"text":"Go for the grilled shrimp poboy- it's great! Crusty bread, cajun-seasoned shrimp, special sauce, and fresh veggies, hard to go wrong. Other items I've had here are hit or miss though.  The fried items aren't great, maybe it's their oil? Their catfish is supposed to be a highlight but I still prefer to drive the extra 10 minutes to Mario's. As for sides, the red beans and rice were pretty gummy, the mac was decent, and the fried okra was so salty it was inedible.  Prices are pretty good. New location is clean, located right by Four Kegs. Service was pretty friendly for grabbing takeout. I'll be back, but I'm sticking to the poboys."}
{"text":"My man and I found this place on a fluke, we were bored, hungry and couldn't decide what to eat one night. We searched Yelp for places near by, and this one came up close to us.   The menu was simple, the list kitchen clean and the staff was very nice. I had the rib tips and he had the cat fish, everything was very well seasoned and flavorful! We have since been back multiple times and never once disappointed!! I'm especially happy they deliver, I'm currently stuck at work, and craving the oxtails with red beans and rice."}
{"text":"So I had no idea this place existed and now that I do, I'm sure I will be there again in the fairly imminent future. I got the oysters and catfish. Both were amazing. Oysters are decent size and really full of flavor. The cat fish was nothing short of perfect in every department. My husband picked it up to go and nothing was soggy at all. That is usually a problem with any fried seafood, in my opinion. I chose Mac n cheese and yams for my sides. Both of those were amazing as well. My husband got shrimp and chicken w/ sweet corn on the side. He said everything was perfect as well.  Everyone should know about this place."}
{"text":"Sooo we walk in, staff isn't super friendly and they didn't have gumbo which was the main reason why I wanted to go there in the 1st place. Mind you we live 25 minutes across town. So I ordered the 6 jumbo shrimp w/red beans & rice and fried okra. My hubby gets the same but with mash potatoes and gravy, which was gross btw. Shrimp was pretty good, red beans & rice were good but bland and okra was alright. The wait was about 20 mins and after my hubby paid, the man gave him a dirty look as if he expected our 6 cent change to be a tip lol not even. The bathroom however was pretty clean which I appreciated. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"It's very rare to find Southern Comfort food that delivers I am so happy I found this place !   Pretty much I ordered the 6 jumbo fried shrimp meal which came with 2 sides ( Mac and cheese And mashed potatoes and gravy ) And my mother got a cheese burger meal which came with 1 side also she got Coleslaw as her side .... The Shrimp were absolutely delicious and true to the name Jumbo lol I loved them the Mac and Cheese was to die for !!! ( I think we all have our different preferences on our fav Mac And Cheese lol ) this was great I loved the whole meal ... My mother LOVED the cheeseburger meal the hun was soft , buttery and flakey and she even woke up in the middle of the night to finish it lol ...   I hope you all enjoy this place as much as we do ... We actually just got some more food delivered from them about 15 minutes ago lol but I had to take the time to share this deliciousness with you all gotta go now time to Dig in :)"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing. Very southern style cooking. Don't expect a lavish layout lol. But come prepared for some mouth-watering southern style eating."}
{"text":"Right down the street from us, we went with 2 children, kids menu grilled cheese was delicious! My husband loved the fried oysters, and 3 as a $4.00 add-on was a good deal. The mac and cheese is to die for, the coleslaw was great too!  Good fresh salad with grilled shrimp, The philly cheese steak could have used a little more meat, and maybe they could start serving coffee. The 2 guys who were cooking and serving were super friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I Love Southern Style Eatry the food is awesome I think awesome is really not a accurate word to describe  The food is damn delicious and the desserts let me just say you will be there everyday trying to get more. I love the staff they make you feel at home and appreciated. I don't care where you move to I will drive to get my food or even catch a Uber."}
{"text":"WHAT?!!!  Shrimp Po-Boy?  Make me wanna jump back kiss myself. Oyster Po-Boy..........best I've had.  Next week when I go back I'm trying something different. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Great place for southern cooking . Catfish is splendid - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside ."}
{"text":"They're usually good. Usually. Sometimes they'll salt the hell out of your food. I'll taste burnt grease on their chicken fingers, and I know it's terrible for me but I'll continue to eat them. Then feel guilty afterwards. But they have great prices and decent service depending on who you get. The catfish is great.  I wouldn't dine in. We left smelling like a bucket of chicken. The \"fried\" smell lingered. We would've been busted if we were supposed to be on a diet. Take it to go."}
{"text":"We just love this place. The best soul food. Live at the mgm and these guys deliver to us. Anything you get is amazing. Great staff as well. This is a must have!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pure goodness. Im addicted to the southernstyle catfish. This place is a must return to no dout. Great food at a wondrful price. Fresh hot & fast. I have to tell all my girl friends about this one."}
{"text":"Food was really good! We had potato salad, baked beans, ribs and chicken catered.... Yum! I don't really care for BBQ sauce and tasted great without it! They will have some on the side if needed."}
{"text":"We were craving for fish n chips so we found this place from yelp. Ordered fried fish w/ 2 sides, not bad for the price $7.99 but the 3 pcs of shrimp ( not so big ) , I think it's a little bit much for $4.00. Anyway the fried fish is very crispy & flaky on the inside , it's good & it's fresh though a bit salty.  The customer service was excellent! Everyone was pleasant & thankful of us coming to their place. I think that's important if u want ur customers to come back. Overall the food was alright, I can come back to try their other stuff in the menu like their popular Po Boy sandwich."}
{"text":"I've always been against eating catfish (because they're so ugly lol) but man their catfish is BOMB!!!! Food is good as well as the service!! They got themselves some regulars :):)"}
{"text":"Their fried fish is heaven, love  the mac and cheese too. Definitely a place ill keep coming back, so deliciously good."}
{"text":"One word. CATFISH.   No, not the stupid reality show. The actual fish. You can get your catfish fix here. Wifey was craving fish so a search on Yelp turned up with this place as the first entry. First visit here I am impressed with several things.  For to go orders, you order at the counter. For dine in, you go sit down in the adjacent room and somebody comes out to take your order.  We ordered two entrees of catfish, one fried and one grilled so that we can taste both styles. Both come with 2 sides, in which we got yams, collard greens, mac n cheese, and fries. We also ordered fried oysters and 10 piece wings.  The catfish (3 piece $7.99). I like the fact that you have the choice of having it grilled or fried. Only thing is, I like it better fried here. Dont get me wrong. The grilled is ok. Its just that it seemed more oily than the fried. Like they deep fried it really quick, than threw some seasoning on it. There seemed to be way more oil on the bottom of my plate for the grilled fish. The fried? Stupendous. Just the right amount of cornmeal. Very crispy and flavorful. Now this folks, is what southern fried catfish is supposed to taste like.   The sides. For you sugar lovers, the yams would be right up your alley. It just might end up being dessert. I think they had it simmered in some kind of molasses infused water until soft. Then serve it to you with sprinkled brown sugar on top. The collard greens were decent. I would say almost equivalent to spinach. This dish was tad bit salty for me though. The mac n cheese good. It is sprinkled with a bit of black pepper so for you that have kids, they might not like it because of that. The fries are crinkle cut. Nothin special.  Fried oysters (6 piece $11.99). Im not into these things but my wife and oldest son said they were very good. I was almost tempted to pick one up and eat it because it was breaded perfectly just like the fish.  The wings (10 piece party pack $8.99). Make sure specify what wings you want. You can order whole chicken wings which are like half the chicken. Kind of like chickens on steroids. The wings I got were your basic hot wings. Only 3 flavors available which were mild, hot, and barbeque. I got hot which was a buffalo hot sauce style and barbeque. Btw, the wings are breaded so if you are not into that, then pass on it.  Service was above average. There were three guys behind the counter constantly staying busy so that was a good sign. One of them took our order and brought our food out to us. He also checked up on us every so often. The dining area is a decent sized one with enough tables and chairs for about 25 people.  Overall, I would recommend going to this place because the fried catfish is on point, the drinks are unlimited serve yourself (there is a fountain drink machine over in the corner with coke products), and the sides are as southern as you can get. Only gripes were that they didnt have fried okra, the grilled fish was more greasy than the fried, and that wait time was a bit long to get the food. In their defense though, they make everything from scratch so I can understand why it took so long. Just dont come here if you're pressed for time. I will definitley be back to try their pork chops, chicken tenders, and po boy sandwiches.  Yelp 2015 review #18 517 overall"}
{"text":"First time here.  I had the fried catfish with yams and mac & cheese sides.  BEST catfish I have had outside of the South.  Hubby had the Oyster Po' Boy and red beans & rice which he was equally impressed with.  Owners are very friendly and prices are very reasonable.  This will be our 'go to' place for Southern food from now on"}
{"text":"A few of us went to dine in. Tried a few things, doesn't matter what. Why? Because there were only 4 tables dining in and our wait time was 1 1/2 hour. No joke, I timed it. Why wait that long? So you don't have to. You're welcome Yelpers :-)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! This place is right around the corner from our house, so we walked over there and gave them a try. So glad we did! My husband got the Philly cheese steak with fries, son had the single burger, daughter got the 6 piece fried fish with fries and mac n cheese, and I had the 6 piece fried shrimp with corn and mac n cheese. All of our meals were excellent! The batter on the shrimp was perfect and I like that they removed the tail so I could eat the whole shrimp. (And the shrimp is huge!) My favorite part though was the mac n cheese. Oh my gosh! Best I've ever had! I also liked that they had self serve drinks...bonus. Give this place a try! You won't be disappointed! We'll definitely be back! (Oh and they also deliver!)"}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick bite to eat & ended up with a meal that I couldn't stop eating. This place I would say is a hidden gem! The owner Fred is super nice, place is really clean & the best part, the food was AWESOME!! There is salt & then there is flavor, this place has the flavor in spades!! I had the fried catfish, greens , red beans & rice & a side of fried oysters. Everything was delicious, catfish has the right amount of crunch on the outside & fish was flaky & moist on the inside. Same with the fried oysters. I would even go as far as saying their catfish was better than hush puppies. My husband has the fried shrimp po-boy, the sauce was flavorful , the shrimp are really big & juicy. This place is worth many trips back!!! Check out their website www.southernstyleeaterylasvegas.net . They have different specials all days of the week."}
{"text":"Right now this location is closed due to sewer lines in the area cracking. The new location will be at Charleston & Torrey pines inside internet cafe area. Should be ready by Tuesday. Spoke to the manager. They did say you can still order delivery. Contact the manager, phone # still works & always super nice."}
{"text":"Good luck trying to redeem your Restaurant.com certificate. I had a certificate for $15 off of $30 total that I purchased July 2014. He told me that expired. I explained these certificates never expire. He then showed me a copy of a Restaurant.com certificate for $10 off of $20 and explained they no longer honor the $15 certificates because it was purchased before they owned the restaurant in September 2014, so I walked out. Never tried them before so I have no idea what they taste like, but I do know I'm never planning on going back."}
{"text":"This place has gone to sh*t. We used to happily drive across town to come here. It used to be great, but it is consistently bad now. The last time we came here, the catfish was dry and overcooked. We came back thinking it was an off day last time...nope...it sucked again. Some pieces were dry and overcooked and some were flat out raw. So disgusting. Someone there likes to flag the bad reviews...shady. Here's a thought, why don't you try improving your culinary skills instead of hiding Yelp reviews and the rest will take care of itself."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the po boys got me sold yum yum yum shrimp n oyster both really good....pork chops yum n yum ....staff very warm n friendly ;)"}
{"text":"This place has the best tasting fried catfish in Las Vegas so far for me.  Im from mississippi and I normally fry my own catfish, but they are down the road from my job.  I called ahead for pickup and forgot I ordered for there.  They called me back letting me know my order is ready for pickup.   Fish was hot and fresh.  I have to try other things on there menu.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This is the spot NOT MARIOS!!! For now on this is my go to place for catfish...the staff and service was the best I ever had at a soul food place the food was A-1 so were the employees come by and eat you won't be disappointed at all trust me!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the fried catfish and shrimp!  We have been looking for a good fish spot since we relocated to Vegas. Far from home but we will be making a specual trip to visit again :p Friendly service too which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"On Friday, Saturday and Sunday don't attempt to come before 2pm...they are always busy preparing for catering jobs...Food is worth the wait...fantastic greens, oyster po-boy and jumbo shrimp were yummy!"}
{"text":"This place has all the charms of an authentic southern eatery (as the name states) from folks in their sunday's best, to football on the big screen, to the head chef reminding you to hold your take out bag level so as to not screw up his sandwich. I got the oyster po boy. It was fried to perfection and seasoned really well. If you like fried oyester po boys, this place will not disappoint. They did take a while to prepare the order, but I can say it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Food was wonderful at a reasonable price!!! Had the fish greens and Mac n cheese they were mouthwatering! My family and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"5/5 stars does not express how GREAT this place really is! The customer service was top notch, \"Kris\" is the lady who was serving was friendly, attentive, and helpful. The cook also stopped by to say hello and and asked how everything was. I could not stop praising the fresh, all WHITE catfish, homemade mac&cheese, yams, and mashed potatoes w/ gravy! My experience was so fantastic, I promised to come back with my family and even got a to go order of chicken for tomorrow!   If you're looking for a soul food place that beats M&M's, Ella Em's, Hush Puppies, etc. you have found the place! Thank me later!"}
{"text":"Not long ago, Restaurant.com was having one of their somewhat usual sales where you could pick up super cheap coupons. Southern Style Eatery happened to be one of those and I purchased a $15 coupon for under $3. If you've ever used Restaurant.com you know that their coupons really have no expiration date, and it's generally always up to the restaurant when they start or stop participating in offering them. Unfortunately, SSE seems to be a place that likes to be very selective on accepting coupons. In what would have easily been a 4 star review, the coupon eventually ended up being a fiasco and ruined our whole experience here...but I'll get back to it.  I believe Southern Style Eatery has only been around for a year or so, maybe two. We've seen it a number of times when in the little strip mall, and they're actually getting ready to open a second location inside the AMPM on Craig & Rancho, which I drive by daily. I heard that location was going to have a much more specialized, somewhat limited menu, so I figured it was finally time to check out the original. From the outside it looks like a take out only place, but they have a pretty large dining area in the space next door. When you dine in, it's full service for the most part, besides a drink fountain in the back corner. There's not much going on in the place, it's a very simple restaurant, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that. I actually really like the simplicity.   After we get seated, we start checking out the menu. It's a pretty big menu, and most of their stuff is priced really well. I was a bit surprised that they don't offer fried chicken though, especially since they offer quite a few fried items. No big deal, I like it all and we had a coupon, so we decided to order a few items to try.  Fried Catfish - With so many good reviews, this was something I had to try. For only $8, you get 3 pieces of fish. At that price, I was not expecting to get such large pieces. The cornmeal batter was just right, and had great flavor. One of my pieces was unusually big and a small portion of it wasn't cooked all the way though. A very minor setback as the rest was nice and flaky, and for the price, this is some really good fried fish.  Ribs - These were on a special that day, so we figured why not. I believe the special price was only $9 and included one side. You can a good amount of ribs, the meat was cooked well and nearly at the point of fall off the bone, but there was a little too much sauce on it for my taste. Even still, really solid for the price.  BBQ Chicken - Another item in their special menu. It came out hot and juicy, and was cooked well. My only gripe was that much like the ribs, it was kind of slathered in sauce. If the skin had any crispiness at all, it was lost in the sauce.  Sides - Since we ordered multiple items, we sampled nearly all their sides. While nothing really stood out as excellent, they were all fairly decent. The mac & cheese was slightly bland, but both the potato salad and greens were above average.   When the waitress/cook (the owner's mother) was ready to get our check, I informed her of the coupon I had. From there on, her tune changed in a big way and everything went downhill. She basically got pissed at me and told me I should have told her that we had a coupon before we sat down. She then went on to tell me she didn't know how to use the coupons and we had to wait there at least 30 minutes for someone to come back and put the coupon in. When I asked her how she didn't know, she showed me a printed one and said that's the only ones she knows how to take. I sat there and compared the printed, and one on my phone and couldn't find any difference. She insisted I had to wait until whoever knew their POS came back to input a simple code. When he arrived 45 minutes later, he had an attitude with me and told me they don't take them anymore, but would do it this one time. Wait...what...this lady just showed me someone else's printed coupon sitting next to the register, and you're acting like your doing me a favor by accepting mine? C'mon. I wouldn't find out until the next day when I decided to check, but they were still selling the same coupon. Why they wanted to cause such an issue and make me wait because their employees aren't trained properly is beyond me. How their attitudes changed so much over a simple coupon made me seriously reconsider ever coming back.  But while standing around at the counter waiting to finally pay for my food, I witnessed the lady who waited on us and assumedly cook our meal prepare food, in a way that had to break health code violation. She was answering phones, taking orders, touching the computer and making food all at the same time. Never once washed her hands, then even went on to put her pen and pad right on to the same prep station the catfish was on.   Since I didn't get sick or die, I'll hope my food was different and 2 stars is likely too generous, but I won't be back now for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was perfect. The cat fish is fresh and perfectly cooked. The mashed potatoes are real, chunks of real potatoes in the mash. The owners and employees are friendly and are obviously dedicated to cooking up good food. In the south we have a saying when we find good food, \"makes me want to go home and slap my mema for not making this\". It's that good!"}
{"text":"Order at the counter and take a seat in the dining room to watch tv.   I ordered the 3 piece chicken tender, with red beans and rice, and macaroni cheese, and a drink, for $8, so I'm already feeling pretty pleased.   The chicken was incredibly tender, and perfectly fried, though it needed a bit of salt. Served with ranch.  Red Beans and Rice, PERFECT. Home style red beans, made just right.  Macaroni and cheese was homestyle as well.   The chicken portion was huge, you truly do not need more than a 3 piece. Hell, add an additional side, and share it with someone. The tenders are almost the size of a full chicken breast."}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago and was very impressed with the service and my meal. I'm new to Vegas and had been craving fried shrimp but couldn't find a place. I came across this one on yelp and decided to give it a get after reading their reviews. I must say, they definitely live up to the positive things being said about them. My boyfriend and I were recognized the moment we walked in, given menus, and sent to an open table. Our orders were taken in a timely manner and when our food arrived it had been freshly cooked and steaming hot. The fried shrimp and swai fish were delicious. As well as the red beans and rice and potato salad. This place will definitely being seeing be again soon in the near future."}
{"text":"great food! seriously got full, everything homemade from scratch and cooked to order. Owners used to own uncle bens bbq, watch was best in city. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"When you walk in the doors to this unassuming hidden gem you feel like you have been transported to a deep south kitchen.  The staff is very friendly and authentic.  They explained to my family that we could take a seat wherever we would like and they would be right with us.  Our server was friendly and helpful.    I enjoyed a 3 piece fried fish with greens and mac and cheese.  My wife had a shrimp Po Boy with mashed potatoes and my daughter enjoyed the kids fried shrimp.  The prices here are extremely reasonable and the portion size is very large.  I can tell you that this is the best fried fish I have had in Las Vegas.  My wife couldn't stop talking about how good the shrimp Po Boy was and my daughter loved her meal.  The collared greens were the best I have ever had.  Yes, the best, ever.  The Mac and Cheese was decent, but nothing special.  The mashed potatoes had this gravy that was unlike anything I have ever had.  It had a unique fish fry taste to it that was nothing short of spectacular.   When I go back, very soon, I will have the 3 piece fish again with the greens and potatoes.  I always consume a very large portion of food and I was very satisfied with the 3 piece fish.  They were huge!  This business is very new and we were the only customers at 10:00 in the morning.  It was a little scary at first but once we tasted the freshly made food we were in love.  It also helps that you can view the entire kitchen so you can see how clean they keep it."}
{"text":"My family members had SE cater my bro-n-luv's 20 year military retirement this past weekend in Vegas. We had family come from different places such as, San Diego, Los Angeles, Colorado and North Carolina to celebrate this awesome occasion. Meanwhile, you know it's hard pleasing so many people because everyone has different palates but if I tell you that NOT one person complained about any of the food we received from Southern Eatery. I kept seeing people going back from ribs 3 times. I went back for chicken twice but third time I decided to place 3 pieces on my plate and I didn't care if somebody said something because the chicken was so darn tender. I don't eat pork or beef but chicken made me sing a Patty LaBelle song...hee hee. The chicken sausage was good as well. Angela $"}
{"text":"The food is great....the people are so nice it is a great place to eat at. Its clean and the prices are appropriate. We went twice in the first week of finding the place. It is a bit of a wait when u order but it is worth it in the end. I would highly suggest the fried shrimp po-boy but any thing you order is good."}
{"text":"So I was super excited to try this place!  I'm always on the look out for a good soul food restaurant.  Unfortunately we were totally disappointed.    1) The floor was sticky,  I mean really sticky.  My flats were coming off as I walked.  Nasty!  2) The table was sticky, my daughter put her hands in spilled soda when we sat.   3) The table wobbled, and we're not talking that slight barely noticeable wobble.  I was searching for something to balance the table.    4) The ketchup & hot sauce bottles were nearly empty and crusty with filth.   5) The customer service was terrible.  I ordered grilled shrimp and she brought out fried shrimp.  I told her it was supposed to be grilled & she told me,  \"Uh-uh you didn't specify\"  & didn't offer to replace them.  I just told her you're completely right and I'm wrong.    6) The server never brought me a water.    7) She forgot to bring out my red beans until 10 minutes after the meal was served.    8) They were out of: french fries and corn bread.  Now let's talk about the food...  9) The shrimp was overcooked.  10) My husband's meatloaf was cold & bland.    11) The mashed potatoes had damn near whole potatoes in it.    12) My red beans were 90% bean juice & the tiny amount of rice that came with the beans was hard.   In addition to all that, they were super unprofessional and yelled absurd things across the dining room at each other,  but on the plus side we now know the servers grandson is getting some money from his dad's money $100 for back to school, $50 for his birthday, and that girl wasn't with him when he went to visit.   So there's that.     The reason we gave it 2 stars at all was because the mac n cheese was decent & my daughter really liked her chicken fingers.  Needless to say we won't be going back.  I love supporting small business,  but I can't very behind this one. It was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Really good food! Tastes homemade. Not greasy at all. We ordered a bunch of different items.. poboys fried and grilled, fried chicken, grilled fish.. everything was great! We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Oh man, this catfish is so damn good!  I also enjoyed the greens since most restaurant greens are sweet but these were not and fully fantastic.  The mac and cheese was alright; I'd give it another go but will probably try another side next time.  For under $10 I got three pieces of fresh fried catfish with two sides.  I did get it to go but even with them cooking the fish right then it did not take too long until I was handed a box o' deliciousness.  I will be back the next time a catfish craving hits."}
{"text":"Good food, I'd say that they could have better flavor for the gumbo, the fries also had that frozen flavor to them. The fish is good, perfect seasoning and fried right. Overall its decent but not out of this world. Customer service is different, I would say they work hard, but fail to make me want to actually eat there, since they are always so busy I get my food to go. Not sure if this is THE best southern food, but its not awful. I am disappointed in the gumbo I had high expectations."}
{"text":"Love this place! Monday was my first time and today I ordered for our office! Everybody loved it and now they want to order once a week. Oyster Po Boy, Fish Po Boy, fried whole wings, yams, greens, fries, Mac and cheese delicious! I will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"First time I ate here and I will say I am very pleased!!!!  I left four stars for the following reason which I think is very fair.  We ordered the following:  1.  Grilled shrimp po' boy with red beans n rice.  The sandwich for starter is delicious, downside was you only get four little shrimp.  I would suggest placing 6-8 to make this $9 order a bit more worth it for your customer.  The roll is perfectly flavored with the right amount of lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.    2.  Red beans n rice:  This dish lacked seasoning but was cooked perfectly with sausage in the beans.  Overall very good but room for improvement.  3.  Mashed potatoes, very good.  4.  Catfish, DA BOMB!!!!  'NUFF SAID  5. JUMBO SHRIMP FRIED AGAIN  DA' BOMB!!!  6.  Mac n Cheese:  cheesy and cooked perfectly!!!  Add some salt and/or pepper and it's perfect.  Overall I am very pleased to have found them on restaurant.com and will be back!!!  4 out of 5 stars as there is room for improvement, food is very good, service was friendly and the restaurant was clean.    Keep up the good work guys!!!"}
{"text":"It started with my phone-in order.  When I finished giving my order and saying \"that's it,\" I heard nothing but the hangup click.  I called back to make sure she got my order and to give my name.  This time I heard \"got it,\" and then the click.  I soon learned that this was because the phone is in their back office and the cook has to stop what she's doing to run back and answer the phone.  Yes, the cook is also in charge of answering the phone.  No surprise--the guy seemed too confused to be able to handle phone orders.  This place was a symphony of confusion and disorganization, due in large part to the fact that only two people were running the place.   During my long wait I witnessed lots of fried food just sitting there in open Styrofoam go-boxes, while they went back to the cooler to drag out mashed potatoes and mac and cheese to warm up in the microwave.  Even though I repeated my sides to them more than once, they got two of four sides right.  My oysters were cold.  But my wife's fried fish, the reason we decided on this place for take-home in the first place, was tough and inedible.  I don't know if the fish had been cooked too long or had freezer burn or what.  But I'm not going back to find out."}
{"text":"Finally. Some good soul food in Vegas without any b.s. twists. This place has good everything. We ordered a couple shrimp Po Boys and a catfish platter and it was worth the trip. Nice dining area inside and friendly service. The fish was fried well and each piece was essentially half of one filet cut vertically which left the pieces more seasoned and more delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was very excited to try it out .. Southern food what's not to love right !! Well this place left a lot to be desired. Let's start with first things .. Apparently someone who works at the restaurant didn't have a baby sitter bc there was a random child running throughout the restaurant dining and to go area... She was quite rambunctious and our table actually attempted to intervene when she was climbing over furniture to make sure she didn't fall ... Not professional at all. Number 2... I understand it's a small operation but the food took almost an hour to come out for a party of 5. If all the food was hot I wouldn't complain but the macaroni and cheese was cold .. And the extra cheese they put on top wasn't even melted .. No bueno.. Seeing how most of their menu consists of fried food I don't understand the wait time. Salt and pepper we're not on every table ... And by 630 a lot of food had already run out (no cornbread no yams). The meat did come out hot the Sides not so much .. I ordered the grilled shrimp which isn't technically grilled I think it's sautéed but it was good non the less .. Others in my party had fried fish and fried chicken which they said tasted well .. Would I probably eat here again ... Yes but I won't rush back .."}
{"text":"I was on vacay from SoCal, staying at the Red Rock Resort and was craving Southern food. Employees at the resort recommended this joint so my good friend Courtney and I had to give this place a shot. I was in the restaurant industry for over 15 years... bussed, waiter, cook, bartender, manager and gm. We arrived at 8pm and were the only ones there. Fred, Mildred & team members treated us like family! Hospitality, great tasting food (wings, catfish, mac n cheese, cole slaw, yams, peach cobbler), clean restrooms... everything was great!!! Not knowing what time they closed, 9pm, we accidently stayed after a little too finish our dinner and we didn't feel rushed at all. Even while they were cleaning the restaurant they would check on us every now n' then yet never mentioned that they were closing. Great experience! I'll be back and tell all my friends about this place. Thank you for having us and making us feel welcomed :)"}
{"text":"The food is GOOOOOOOD!!!! I'm thoroughly impressed with the portion sizes, and of course, THE TASTE!!!! The staff was nice and cordial...Great Job guys!!! :)"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!!!!  We yelped this place & decided to try it out since we're in town for a few days. Walked in and it was a few other customers. The staff was very friendly upon our entrance. We were asked if we were dining in or take out, we decided to dine in. The server advised us of the daily special & the sides that were available.   We ordered 12 fried shrimp, 3 catfish filets, 3 chicken tenders, sides were potato salad & yams. & 1 kids meal 3 fried shrimp & mashed potatoes. The shrimp were huge!!! They use cornmeal for the batter so that part was just OK, but they were good & worth trying. The catfish was the bomb.com!!!! Lightly breaded and not fishy smelling! The tenders were juicy & flavorful. The sides were good too. We even had food 2 go!!!   Takes about 20mins to prepare, but it was all fresh & piping hot when it was ready. I'd definitely come back for more when I'm in town. Yelp didn't disappoint today!!!"}
{"text":"The is my 1st time here since they moved to the new location. Service was good. Facility was clean. It's smaller than the other location, but that's ok too. We ordered fried shrimp, fried cat filets, greens, Mac, & yams. Everything was good, but I don't like how you can't order just meat only. Like just shrimp or fish w/out sides. My kids didn't want anything but shrimp & I still had to buy dinners. I didn't like that. The prices seem a little higher too! Everything was still delicious, I'll give them that & I hope they do well here. BLESSINGS!!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try a new spot last night and this was it. While looking at ALL the negative reviews on here we almost decided to change our minds. But he really wanted to try the catfish so we gave it a shot. And im so happy we did. Holy smokes its the best soul food ive found in vegas so far. Him and I couldn't stop talking about how good the food was for the next couple of hours after we finished. I understand a lot of people are upset about the wait times. I waited almost 45 minutes for mine (pick up). But guess what in that 45 minutes I watched my fish get freshly battered and fried for me along with my shrimp. Not something that had been sitting out for an hour + already. Had the greens and mac and cheese with it as well.  SO DAMN GOOD ! Im happy to say I found my new spot. I know the waiting sucks but we really should be reviewing the quality of the food on here, not bashing them for the wait to make quality food for you."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY  Food took 2.5 hours to arrive. Some was cold. Did not get fries that were listed as coming with the sandwiches. Piece of pie was maybe two bites. Overall a joke. Will not do again."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience.  This place is filthy so I should have known better.  Even the front door handle is darn near black and has never been cleaned.  I still gave it a shot because Vegas has very little good southern restaurants.  They were out of shrimp so I had to go with chicken.  Chicken was good.  I asked for ranch and there was about a tablespoon in a cup. Obviously there is a ranch shortage in the world that I don't know about.   I ordered a side of fish to try it.  To my surprise, the fish and additional sides were not in my order when I got home.  Super annoying!  I wanted to try items so I could know if this is a place I want to return to.  Since I was shorted on the order, I decided this is not a place to come back to.  Nothing really stood out except it was dirty and hot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Shrimp & Oyster Po-Boy is what to order. I'm a stickler on fried foods and this is the best I am also a stickler about service. This place hits it out of the park in both areas"}
{"text":"The BEST FRIED TILAPIA I HAVE EVER HAD!!! It was the perfect combination of crispy and tender!! The red beans and rice was  delicious!  The fried okra was some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Had to get my fix... got the 12 piece jumbo shrimp added fish bill was  $24... thought it was cheaper. Didn't get a receipt and had to get back to work so I didn't fight it. Food is Hella good though why better then Lola's forsure."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STINKIN DELICIOUS!!!!!  We ordered a fried shrimp po boy, order of catfish, chicken tenders, and kids burger.  All the food here is simply amazing! The catfish here is FAT. They give Mario's a run for their money for sure! The breading is perfect and it's cooked really well!   The po boy is seriously the best one I've had, EVER. The shrimp were HUGE! The breading was perfect, they were juicy and the sandwich itself is large! The side of fries were also delicious and not all soggy and funky. The chicken tenders were soooo juicy and tender and not overly breaded and HUGE as well! Would def purchase them again! The stand out of this meal was the coleslaw! It's a mayo base and I swear I could just eat it all day!  They also serve a franks red hot sauce (idk if its the real franks) hot sauce, not this Louisiana hot sauce crap! The real deal!  Food is simply delicious and we will be going back for sure!  Yay!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give Southern Style Eatery a try. I had the 3 piece fish with sides of collards and beans and rice. The fish was very good, the beans/rice were my next favorite and collards were over cooked and had the texture and taste of spinach.  I wouldn't drive across town for a plate but I would definitely come in regularly if I lived in the area. Fortunately, I have choices in my area to keep my happy. The cooks were very very nice and food came out in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Great southern style cooking. Had the smothered pork chops and rice and also ordered the fish and oysters. Sides: potato salad, mac and cheese, & yams. All delicious. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. The catfish was amazing. I had the catfish plate and my hubby had the catfish po boy. We tried the mac and cheese, the red beans and rice and the sweet potato pie. Everything was made from scratch and I can't remember the last time I had such a delicious southern meal!"}
{"text":"Can I leave no stars?!?! Went here Saturday afternoon because it has been on my bookmark list for a few weeks.  PFFTTTT.  We went at 3pm and they were closed.  No signs saying emergency, had to leave early..NOTHING!!!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying....... LOCATION, Location, location!!!!  The location is excellent, and what I mean by that is; you do not have to go into the alphabet streets to get great tasting soul food! upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by very pleasant older woman that reminded me of someone's mother, that aunt that you love to visit, or just the very pleasant neighbor down the street that always make you feel welcome to come over anytime, but it was my mother that she reminded me of when I asked \"is the catfish farm raised or freshwater caught?\" she took one look at me as if she wanted to say.... WHAT THE HELL?!? she then turned and pointed to a young man to her right \"you have to ask Fred\" (I found out later that Fred was her son) I must admit I was very surprised and very pleased to find out that they serve both (I don't do farm raised) I ordered the three piece catfish with red beans and rice and good old macaroni and cheese, catfish was made to perfection, I am not sure if it was frozen but it had a very fresh taste, seasoned perfectly, temperature very hot! Best damn cat fish I've had since my mother moved back to Chicago, now the mac and cheese and the red beans and rice not as good as my mom's but better than any I have tasted here in Vegas, yes even better then the place with the same name as the candy.... You know... Melts in your mouth, not in your hands!  I was so satisfied, and comfortable (unusual for me when I am dining alone) I forgot to pay the damn bill!  Yep...said my good byes as if I was leaving family and friends, got in my car, put on my driving shoes, even started the car looked up and again saw my MOTHER with that look on her face; No not that one...the warm, sweet, and forgiving one that only your mother would give you when you f$&k'd up,  When went back inside Fred (the son/owner) was very nice about it, he even said that it happens all the time.... I'm guessing that I'm not the only one that feels right at home in this little eatery!"}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop's restaurant. Their food has a very good home taste to it. However, you can tell they lack some business experience. When we arrived the older lady was arguing with the person who was taking our order. I felt a bit awkward and surprised that they were running a business that way.  In regards to the food, the spaghetti was awesome. The meat sauce had a lot of fresh tomatoes which were delicious.  We also had the fried catfish which was crunchy and perfectly cooked. The sides were very average. The coleslaw had very large pieces of cabbage. The mac and cheese looked dry and lacked some flavor.  The prices were reasonable and the overall taste of the food was good. I can see why some reviews are only one star and why some others are four stars. The food is really good, but the customer experience is not that great."}
{"text":"I received a coupon the other day in one of those mailers full of coupons and noticed that this place is just around the corner from my house. My niece and I decided to give it a try and I'm so happy we did. I read over the other Yelp reviews and was very excited to give it a go, the coupon had some killer deals.  When we walked in, we were greeted by the super-friendly staff, Larry the owner, is very personable and they are all very polite.  The entire restaurant is very clean, including the restrooms. I love that the kitchen is completely open, you can even see into the refrigerator. The way that they have the restaurant divided, you can dine peacefully while the kitchen bustles. All of the food is prepared and cooked fresh so be a little patient, it is well worth it.  This first round, we came in around 2 o'clock on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, we decided to try a couple of things:  Southern Double Burger with Fries - the patties were homemade, no frozen meat, sweet onions, juicy and fresh with perfectly fried crinkle cut french fries.  Fried Shrimp Po-Boy - succulent, large, golden brown battered shrimp with a butter toasted, soft roll.  Greens - best I've ever had, no bitter aftertaste, perfectly seasoned with a wonderful smokey taste. I added a little hot sauce and they're even better with a little kick.  6 Piece Oysters - perfectly cooked, tender in the middle with just enough batter, great fry batter too, it didn't fall off if you decided to eat your oyster with more than one bite.  Red Beans & Rice - bland but has potential, all of the fresh flavors are there, it just needs a little more time to simmer the beans and some seasonings.  Macaroni & Cheese - needed just a dash of salt and pepper but definitely homemade and delicious.  I'm so happy that they have a self-serve soda and iced tea machine.  The chef was so nice and happy to hear feedback on his cooking, he even brought us out some spiced yams to try. Honestly, I hate yams and my niece didn't know that they were sweet potatoes. One bite, I was in heaven! They were buttery and warm, the spices were on point. I can honestly say, he made me a yam fan. I will probably never order them anywhere but here, but I'll for sure be having them here when they're on the menu.  We had such an awesome experience that my niece and I decided to bring my Grandma back for lunch the next day. Again, everyone was amazing and we tried a few new things too:  12 Piece Jumbo Shrimp - these shrimp were cleaned and cooked perfectly, the batter was light enough to taste the fresh shrimp but cooked perfectly that it stayed on after the first bite. The quality is amazing, they bring a whole new definition to \"jumbo\". You don't find good shrimp like this in Vegas.  Mashed Potatoes & Gravy - needed just a bit of salt and pepper but I couldn't make them any better myself. I'm a huge fan of chunky mashed potatoes, I don't like them so smooth they can be used as wallpaper paste. They were buttery and delicious. The gravy was perfect, smooth and packed with flavor.  Coleslaw - creamy but not too sweet. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan but this is a very good side dish. Being homemade never hurts.  6 Piece Fried Fish - this fish was so moist and the breading was delicious. I ordered way too much, the portion is huge, well worth the money.  Fried Oyster Po-Boy - so my niece can't get enough of the fried oysters. She wasn't so sure about them yesterday but they've made a new fan.  Again, the chef was so nice and happy to hear feedback on his cooking, he brought us each a bowl of his homemade banana pudding with Nilla wafers to try. I was in a food coma. I can't wait to go back and I'm definitely telling everyone where to go to try some Southern Style Eats."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and he did not lie! Food is AMAZING! Best Gumbo in town! Food is fresh and portions are filling. Service was great as well! Food so good my 3 year old kept giving a thumbs up after every bite and children do not lie! Great variety and my family and I enjoyed everything we ordered. We will be back for sure! If you have not been, please go and try."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to succeed. I needed somewhere that reminded me of home. I wanted this place to shed all of the negative reviews and become a place people like myself can feel good about supporting. I'm so disappointed with this place.  With all of that being said, My friend and I visited this place tonight, for the second time this week. We wanted the same thing we got last night, maybe minus the long wait and the banana pudding. We wanted that good southern soul food taste that we had been craving. We couldn't deny it, we were hooked.  We traveled 20 minutes away from home and got to this place at 7:09 pm. When we walked in, we were greeted by our server yesterday. We knew the process already so we picked a seat and sat down. That was at 7:10 pm. We didn't get a menu until 7:14pm. It took us 2 minutes to decide what we wanted, but it took her until 7:20 to come back out to take our order.  We ordered the Sunday's Special: Smothered Chicken (White Meat) with Dressing and Mac&Cheese as sides and Yams as the additional side. My friend ordered 3 piece Whole Wings with Mashed Potatoes (No Gravy) and Greens as sides. She also added 3 pieces of Fried Fish on too. This time, drinks were optional and we declined.  Let me mention, I asked the waitress if I could add on the Fish and she ignored me. I assumed she didn't hear me but there was no way for her not too. My friend then repeated my question and she nodded yes, like we should have known the answer already. That was strike one.  As we were waiting for our food, another couple walked in. This was maybe 10 minutes after we sat down. She promptly gave them a menu and took their order. They didn't have to wait for her to finish talking in the back, like we did. They ordered and started waiting like us.  It's now, 7:40pm, 20 mins before they're suppose to close. We were getting very irritated, because this was now the 2nd day of waiting 40+ mins for food that should take 15-20 mins tops.  The waitress came back, I thought she was going to give us an update on our food, but she didn't. She grabbed a mop and went to clean the restroom. She was accompanied by 3 little boys, around the age 8, as she cleaned the bathrooms. They stayed in there for about 10 minutes.  She came out and went back into the kitchen. To be honest, we didn't think she was going to wash her hands, so I got up and walked towards the front, where the kitchen is. I did see her grab a paper towel so I assumed she washed her hands, although I was too slow In walking to actually confirm.  It's now 7:50pm. I stood at the front for a few minutes. I wanted to see what the hell was taking so long. I observed 3 little boys in the kitchen. I didn't see them wash their hands at all. 1 of the boys, in particular, was coughing profusely near the food. I presumed he was sick because he was taking out trash with no jacket on.  Let me throw in, while I was standing there, the cook asked if I wanted gravy on my dressing. I realized that she was working on our food. With my response, they finished a couple plates, and stuck the plates in the window to be picked up and dropped off at our table.  The waitress grabbed the plates and walked towards the couple that entered after us. This was at 7:55pm, by the way. She served them their food 1st. I was confused as to why they were getting food 1st, so I walked back towards our table, which happened to be next to the couple.  The lady went back to the window and grabbed the other plates, she then took those plates to that table also. At this point they had 3 plates of food on their table.  The woman of the couple told the waitress that it wasn't her food. The waitress then took our plate of food back to the window and she was pissed. She said, \"This is the s**t I don't like!\" Her and the male cook had a short argument and then she stormed away and came towards our table. She put the plate on our table, in front of my friend, and walked away. She walked back to the window and inquired about my plate.  At 7:59pm the waitress walked up to our table and said, we only have dark meat left. They gave away the last white meat. Do you want me to bring you a menu?\" I said, \"No!\" The waitress away like that was that. I called her back over after few seconds and she hesitantly walked back over. I told her that my friend's potatoes had gravy on it and he ordered it without gravy. She said, \"Sorry, I'm not in the kitchen.\" I said that I didn't have any food so my friend didn't want her's. She didn't want to eat food that was picked over by another table either.  The lady snatched the plate off the table, without saying a word, and slammed it in the window. She said, \"Y'all didn't have the other plate, now they don't want this one.\" We could hear the cooks in the back complaining. They were saying, \"That's f'd up!\" This was 8:03pm.  We went out the main door and said that were not waiting another 40 mins. They never acknowledged us!  They were added to our \"Never Again\" list!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were excited to try this place, the reviews said the food was good. We got there and it was very warm inside, it was 106 degrees outside and the AC wasn't working. All the workers were sweating. That can't be sanitary. There was a serious problem with flies...how is that possible indoor? I couldn't enjoy my food from the flies landing on my food. Very foul. The prices seemed steep for the low budget environment and they didn't have all the items listed on the menu. Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some catfish, yams and greens. So delicious! If you're looking for some sweet soul, this is the place!!! Juicy fried fish, sweet yams, excellently flavored greens... Not bitter at all with a nice little hint of vinegar. Delicious southern style food!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout food on the afternoon of May 6, with no incident. This was the 1st time I had been there and my sister and mother raved about the food - they weren't wrong! We ordered grilled and fried fish & shrimp - all of it was delicious - well seasoned, not fishy smelling, light breading and not greasy at all. We decided to order grilled shrimp and fried fish for Mother's Day and placed the order on Saturday.  It was to be ready at 2:00 pm on May 8th.  We went to pick up our order and they couldn't even remember it! The man told my sister it would be 10-12 minutes, so we waited.  Two other women came in to pick up a catering order to be delivered (they offer delivery) that they placed 2 days before, because they called them and told them they had to come pick it up!  The man then asked my sister if she was with the 2 women; now he just talked to her and had come in before them!  He kept promising my sister that they were working on it.  She saw one customer bussing her own tables, because there was no busboy. Unfortunately the food suffers because of the management of the business.  They can even hire some high school kids to be servers and bus staff.  They need 1-2 up front and a food expediter in the kitchen. How did this establishment even get a food license and where is the Health Department when kids are running around coughing on the food? Too bad."}
{"text":"Amazing we ordered catfish chicken tenders shrimp sweet potatoes and potatoe salad everything was good no complaints that fish was the best though fresh crispy outside and soft meat in the inside just like i like it the tenders were really good as well the shrimp was ok a little salty but it was still decent i like this place the staff was really nice and respectful cant wait to try the ribs and meatloaf"}
{"text":"\"Wow!\" you might be asking yourself, \"How could they go from five stars to ONE?\"   Simple. Rudeness and horrible, horrible customer service.   It has been made very plain to us that if you call in an order, YOU ARE BOTHERING THEM AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU. Since we never eat in the always sweltering dining room, this is a problem. They are flat out rude. I tried to tell the old owners that randomly changing their business hours (without posting a sign) and barely speaking into the phone enough to be heard over the background noise was NOT a way to do business, but they never listened.  Apparently, that is the ONLY way to do business in that building. We were excited when I read there were new owners, but the new staff of Southern Style Eatery are just as UN-grateful for your business as the old ones. They're only slightly better organized, but any discounts for checking in or reviewing are have been randomly applied depending on the technological competence of the person at the computer.   Yes, the food is good...when you get it and if your order is correct. Honestly, that's why we stopped going. Look at how many check-ins I have for this place. We made excuse after excuse for why the side orders were in the wrong meals or they ran out of something, but having to consistently fight to get the right food as the prices kept creeping up got old and we stopped going.  If your family who staffs the restaurant is driving business away, then find people who won't. I am tired of trying to fight to even PLACE an order and give you my money, so my family just isn't going to do it any longer.  I'm sorry, but after a long love affair, we just cannot excuse the incompetence so that we can get catfish cooked with Louisiana Fish Fry mix. We are officially over.  The next new owners should feel free to contact me so that they can learn from the mistakes of the past."}
{"text":"Not a very fancy place, but the food is really good.  I really enjoyed the grilled fish.  The combination of seasoning, onions, and peppers was awesome.  If you're in the neighborhood, I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"My brother and I ordered for pickup, they said it would be ready in 12 minutes and as soon as we got there the food was ready, all we had to do was pay and go. The gentleman was very friendly. We get home, get our food. I ordered the shrimp po boy it smelled so good I just went in for the bite so I didn't get a chance to get a photo of it cause I was enjoying it too much. Also their banana pudding is sooooooooo good. I will be back soon just for that."}
{"text":"The fried catfish and oysters were seasoned perfectly and almost brought tears of joy to my eyes.  Mashed potatoes and gravy must be home made and oh so good.   The 3 piece fish meal has generous portions.  Sadly, I didn't have room for dessert.  Barqs rootbeer and Fanta orange fountain drinks.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Moved to a new location, but as good as ever!  Easy access from the freeway.  Huge TV in the dining area.  Plenty of parking.  Clean.  Excellent service.   I had my usual of shrimp, oysters, red beans n rice,  and yams.  I ate it all.  No time for pictures!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  I ordered the catfish with greens and yams (I thought my sister made the best yams but this place gave her a run for the money or should I say yams) the greens were very tasty as well as the catfish My sister ordered the whole chicken wing meal with yams and Mac & cheese everything was very good and the Carmel cake was the bomb.com we had to order more because the cake we planned to take home but that never happened"}
{"text":"Been here several dozens of times.  Food is excellent.  The only reason I don't give them a 5 star rating is two times I've ordered pork chops to go and when I've gotten home, they were burnt.  And that's two times out of maybe 50, but they should never served burnt food.    But again, food is outstanding and the employees are extra nice!"}
{"text":"love love love the red beans & rice ,catfish, greens & yam!!! great place for lunch or dinner friendly staff and great atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"No frills, soul-food establishment really specializing in seafood!  First off I have to say the service isn't exactly M&M Soul Food, but I didn't mind because I was really there just for the food. Ordered the catfish with collards and red beans and rice. Catfish was very nice and flakey on the inside while the cornmeal batter was greatly seasoned.   Have to come back here to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"We got a coupon in the mail via Valpak and decided to give the place a try and are we glad that we did!  I had the shrimp po-boy and my husband got the oyster.   Nice big pieces cooked just right with not too much batter and not masked by a big hunk of bread.  Red beans and rice were very good too and fantastic Key lime pie.  Kenny and Larry (the owner) are really trying to build up the business as they are in a location not real visible from the street they are very friendly and helpful.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place tastes like you have big granny in back cooking Everything is delicious I have not tasted anything here that was not good I will eat here everyday if I could   Food is delicious!!!! Customer service is Great!!! It's very clean !!!! Everything is fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this Place! I am from Louisiana.They have the best southern food in Vegas way better than M&M soul food cafe. Customer  service was phenomenal and , I came in on a Sunday night at 7:40 twenty minutes to closing in they hook me up THE BEST SOUTHERN FOOD IN TOWN hands down"}
{"text":"First the good news. This food is bomb! My hubby hates catfish, but loves it here. It's perfectly seasoned. The collard greens as well as all their sides tastes truly authentic of the south, thus we come here quite often. Now the bad news, this place is shady at best. They're suppose to have oxtails on Sundays. We went on Sunday and were told they didn't have any. No explanation given. We even went there once to get our kid a hamburger and were told they didn't have any even though they are on the menu. The service is hit or miss because many times we've overhead the servers and cooks loudly yelling at each other which is awkward and unprofessional for us patrons to observe. And just a few days ago we went to get take out only to he told that they were closing early because the cook/owner needed a beer! Huh! Also, we ordered collard greens and instead of simply telling us they were out ( which seems to be happening more and more as of late ) they simply added more mac and cheese without informing us. So, bottom line, if you can catch them, the food is great. Just don't be surprised if food they advertised isn't available, staff is yelling at each other or if the owner bails early for a beer!"}
{"text":"The food  was absolutely fantastic! ! I  had the fried chicken wings  with greens and French fries. The chicken was hot fresh and full size wings.  The greens taste just like back home Chicago style.  The atmosphere was great and the customer service was too. The price and variety of food is an excellent value.  I will most definitely be back here again when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed their food. And the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Greens! Delicious yams! The Banana Pudding is very good! Sweet potato pie is Perfect. You get your bang for your buck here. 12 piece Oysters & 6 piece Fish very filling and worth the price. Have no complaints. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a shrimp poboy. The bread was like a soggy roll. I couldn't identify the sauce on it. The potato salad was 90% water with very little flavoring. I didn't feel full after eating. On the bright side, the hush puppies weren't that bad."}
{"text":"2 hours late on delivery, then they said they had certain items and when they FINALLY delivered the items were missing and the food was cold! My work is only 5 minutes away from them! Spoke to an employee on the phone about the missing items! I was told off and sworn at! I support small local establishments but I will never EVER recommend this Place to anyone ever again!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a minus 5, I would. This has to be one of the most unprofessionally run restaurants in town. I have eaten there (take out) on many occasions and every time there has been issues.   It takes several attempts for them to even pick up the phone...then there is much attitude. You call and are told a pick up time and u still wait at least 15 minutes...and your order is most probably incorrect. If you call to have food catered, they forget you even called..then have an attitude as if it is your fault. They boast about their catering and say they deliver but will probably call you to come pick it up anyway.  There is no staff and wait staff gives you attitude as if you are doing them a favor. Well customers are not doing you a favor. First of all, I have never seen more than one wait person at anytime. Tables are not bussed properly and you have to ask for a drink cup. You are there because we come in. There are too few cooks and they seem overwhelmed every time I have been there.  The last time in was waiting for takeout I waited an hour and they had not even started my order then acted like it was not an issue.   I think it is sad that there is not a decent professionally run southern style restaurant in that area. If this restaurant was in a decent location and had trained managers, it may succeed but it will not last being run as it is.   Due to my last experience there I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Update from earlier review. I contacted the restaurant about the tainted food my wife and I ate last Tuesday before Christmas. The person who answered the phone could not have sounded less sympathetic, he told me manager was not in and to call back around 2pm. This was on Saturday, well I called back and sure enough, no manager and no owner on duty!   Needless to say, I will not eat in or order from this place ever again and I hope you dont either, believe me, your stomach and backside will thank you!"}
{"text":"Very good food .   When you think southern food you think of places like this. This brings me back to when I lived in Ten. and s.c. There are thousands of restaurants like this up and down the coastal.   The order - Po boy' oyster side of mac and cheese, side of coleslaw, and Key lime dessert !.    Po Boy' was verry good the bread held up very good my concern at first was it was more like a hotdog bun however it taste more like lobster rolls bread. It was nicely toasted and tasted very good.   Both the side are amazing. I have had coleslaw and mac and cheese done wrong before at places claiming to be \" southern\"  that lack flavor. The mac and cheese really great they have a seasoning on it I can't point out either like a old bay seasoning in it or some type of spice like cayenne ? and the coleslaw is mayo based however verry good.   The key lime was great the crust almost tasted like coconut witch I haven't had it like that since living back in the south.   My hopes for the restaurant continue adding items to your menu its a very select menu witch is fine to me because you would rather get things done right the first time then not. Deff wanna see cornbread lol.   Defiantly worth one visit to check them out if you like the street car you'll like this."}
{"text":"Good, well seasoned real southern food. Friendly service, laid back atmosphere and excellent prices!"}
{"text":"My co-worker recommend this place and he hasn't steered me wrong yet. The food was hot flavorful and delicious. The fish was fried just right not too hard and seasoned perfectly. The collards were seasoned very well, and the Mac & Cheese was like Momma's homemade. I will definitely be back!!!"}
