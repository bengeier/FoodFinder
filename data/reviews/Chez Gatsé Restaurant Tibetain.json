{"text":"The upshot: My 9 yr old said this was the best food he'd ever had. My husband and I, both foodies, discussed whether we could even remember the last meal that was as delicious. Dont miss out on eating here. Get the Yeti meal. Don't argue just do it.

The rest: As a student at UQAM, St Denis has been a food haunt of mine for years. I had never noticed this small restaurant tucked away. If you've never had Tibetan, it's like a dellicious combo of Chinese and Indian. Service was kind and prompt. The interior was modest, but pleasant and so were prices. The Yeti meal offered a sample of traditional favorites,  but the beef thuk tag was beyond yumminess."}
{"text":"New fav surpise find. Run by a Tibetan family, the place has cozy ambience and real nice food.  We were walking from Distillerie and found this place on the other side of the road. The inside is decorated with traditional Tibetan artifacts and Dalai lama posters. 

We started with Lentil Soup which is similar to lentil soup that you can find in turkish restaurants a lot like what we call daal in my country (Bangladesh). 

Then we tried the momo combination 3beef+1cheese. The cheese momo is huge! It's kinda sweet and doughy. I actually liked the beef momos better and probably would order only that next time. The chilli sauce with the momo was super hot and I simply loved that pairing. Fair warning: by hot, I mean wayyy hotter than the average Canadian taste palette. I am South Asian so I usually take my food very spicy.

For the main course I had Chicken Lhasa which is their recommended dish. I chose sweet bread as a side because the waiter (who's Tibetan) said that that's what they traditionally have. Tibetan Sweet bread is like the dough part of a momo with sandwhich bread-like texture on the inside. I loved my order but I would go with a side of rice next time, just because I am a more rice type person. The Chicken Lhasa was like a kind of curry. I loved every part of my meal.

My friends ordered the Shapta which was also a curry but a bit like Chinese curry. It has capsicum (pepper) in the mixture which contributes a different kind of flavour.

Most improtantly, the price here is unbeatable. Most main dishes are $9.99. So worth the experience. Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've always had great meals here.

Great chicken, great momos, decent ambiance, friendly staff, cards accepted.

What more do you want?

It's cozy and feels so right for a meal on a winter night... Feels like you're in a cabin in the Himalayas

BTW They're open from 17h - 22h Mon - Sun"}
{"text":"Resto tibétain typique et d'origine (apparemment il existe depuis 1990!)
Service excellent, le gars (sans doute le propriétaire?) est vraiment gentil et aux petits soins
J'ai testé la crème de fromage bleu et j'ai été assez déçue, car je m'attendais à une consistance de crème mais elle était très liquide, et ne goûtait pas assez le fromage selon moi (j'aime les fromages très goutus!!)
Par contre, les momos et le Yéti (formule entrée-plat-dessert) étaient tous très bons, et le Yéti très copieux! Le pain vapeur est excellent, surtout trempé dans la petite sauce rouge! Les légumes étaient très bons aussi, dans une sauce très originale.
Bière et vin vraiment pas chers (entre 3,79 et 5$ la bière et 4,90 le verre de vin)
A essayer!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little cosy place off the busy St-Denis strip.
The owners are both from Tibet and very welcoming. You can find the usual Momos on the menu which is probably the most typical tibetan dish. 
I must admit that I went there with my mom, who has been to India and Nepal more times than I can count and enjoys Tibetan food wherever she goes, so I referred to her when it came to the tasting. 
We saw the lady in the kitchen going to the freezer to bring back a bag of frozen chinese dumplings which they passed as beef momos so it was not a nice start. The food was not bad, though I wouldn't say that it was good either. We had a few Momos which had not much taste whether they were beef or cheese or whatever. The lentil soup was good and the beef noodles (a tibetan special) not bad but nothing exciting that would make your mouth go \"Mmmmore\"!"}
{"text":"Chez Gatse is an underrated gem in Montreal! The food portions are generous and the quality and flavours are excellent. I highly recommend the vegetarian momo's. This place offers a little bit for all different types of eaters. It is a friendly, casual spot with limited frills and during the summer a patio space to enjoy. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere was great! We got the lunch deal and it was delicious! I went there during snow season and the owner came out of the store and helped us park. It took us a few minutes to get the car parked in the side road but he was so sportive about it! Tibetan atmosphere, food is amazing"}
{"text":"On a warm Friday night I found myself with a group of friends wading through the crowd on St. Denis, we worked up an appetite but everything around us was packed, to make matters worse, one of the guys was a vegetarian.  I fired up Yelp for assistance and eventually we decided on Tibetan.  

Chez Gatse sounded promising with a long history and a location just off the main strip. I called to see if we could get a table, turns out the place was dead, which was the first hint that something was amiss. The owner, who was very nice and who took my call, already had a table set for us in the rather large terrace out the back of the restaurant.

The food was a big let down.  The bulk of the menu could be found in any of your average Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  I had one of the more Tibetan dishes \"Lhasa Chicken\" which was a chicken leg and thigh batter fried and then drenched in a brown gravy.  It was edible, but I wasn't impressed.  

I was expecting something different but instead I got mediocre Canadian Chinese food. Their one saving grace is they have a liquor license and a nice terrace.  Regardless I can't see myself going back, the food was forgettable."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Tibetan restaurant in Montreal as I love Tibetan momos(dumplings). We found this place on Yelp  and  was very warming and friendly environment here. Loved their Tibetan style cheese momo..very different taste then usually I get(sweet and salty..good mixer and perfectly cooked)..very satisfying"}
{"text":"Quality authentic Tibetan food, and plenty of vegetarian options. The momos are fantastic! Although the fruit dessert is most likely delivered straight out of a can, it's very easy to overlook considering the overall experience."}
{"text":"This was the first Tibetan restaurant in Montreal, long before the more popular Shambala. It's on Ontario Street not far from Quartier Latin and Cegep de Vieux Montreal.

While there usually is a stream of UQaM students here, the food is quite tasty, prices are low and the owner is a really nice guy. They even have a terrasse in the back open during the summer. Their steamed dumplings called Momos, are excellent and their cheese soup is probably the most amazing thing you can have on a cold winters day.

I have to warn you on the butter tea. Real butter tea in Tibet is make with yak's milk, and while I'm not sure if they use the real thing here or not, or maybe substitute with buttermilk, it is definitely an acquired taste. It tastes salty, buttery and milky all at the same time. I personally now enjoy it but it's not for everyone."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely unique. I enjoyed it, but I cannot comment on its authenticity. The butter tea is odd. I didn't dislike it, but I wouldn't drink it all the time. The momos were yummy, with the cheese one being my favorite. It was a little sweet. The beef ones were basically just like Chinese steamed dumplings. The service was good, and their menu is in both English and French. The server spoke both as well. They were friendly. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian platter for delivery from Just Eat, and was quite underwhelmed. The cheese momo was not very good, and everything else (veg momos, vegetables, soup) was average at best. The entire meal amounted to about $20 including tax and tip, which I felt was quite high, considering the quality."}
{"text":"Ma première visite ce fut il y a plus de 17 ans. Toujours un plaisir d'y retourner. Le nouveau proprio est vraiment sympathique et le service est plus que parfait."}
