{"text":"Best vietnamese canteen in Montreal! Nice place to eat fresh banh mi (vietnamese sandwich) or Phõ (vietnamese soup) or vermicelli. Chef Wayne is fully dedicated in his kitchen to serve his clients."}
{"text":"Proche de l'école où je travaille et c'est super bon. Jamais vu des bahn mi avec autant de bonne viande et de gros morceaux"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm usually not a fan of Vietnamese cuisine but there is something about this place that really hits the spot for me. The broth is great, the chicken is tasty, their coffee is amazing. I've tried everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed. Is it a little more expensive? Sure, but the extra dollar is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"The best pho restaurant in the area without a doubt. Banh Mi, pho, pork shop, its all really good. The chef is very talented and the service is pleasant.   Though the prices are slightly higher than other pho restaurants, it is worth it in my opinion. Better quality ingredients, and prime location make it justifiable.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I stayed in Saint-Henri a few years ago and was surprised to find few options for affordable, tasty food. Things on Notre-Dame have changed quite a bit since then, with the opening of Adamo, Arthur's Nosh Bar, Lupita and co. TRAN is the new kid on the block, a pho restaurant set in a clean, black & white room. The menu reflects the minimalistic space, with a handful of pho and rice choices. If you're a fan of tripe or brisket you won't be able to eat it here though, as the limited menu only offers rare beef, flank or chicken pho.   I ordered the rare beef. The restaurant is affiliated with the excellent Pho Tay Ho in Rosemont, so I sort of expected the soup to be tasty. It was, however my beef was never rare or even medium rare- either it arrived fully cooked or the scorching hot broth cooked it in seconds.   I knocked off another star because of the price and the fact that they use plastic cups. I'm sure most pho connaisseurs would agree- the price is a bit steep for a bowl that's very similar to what you'd get in Chinatown. You might argue that you're paying extra to eat in a clean and visually pleasing environment, but I could suggest a few places that are cheaper and still meet those criteria.   Nevertheless, if you're in the area, it's not a bad place to stop by."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch a few months ago. Their bahn-mi sandwiches are quite large and messy to eat but very flavourful. I way preferred the chicken one over the beef one because their beef was very fatty. It was my first time trying this kind of sandwich but I thought it was delicious.  Their spring rolls were decent but nothing memorable. I got to try their pho from a coworker and thought it was delicious and burst with flavour. What I like is that if you get it to go, they will give you a separate container for the hot broth, and one for the veg so that nothing gets soggy.  If I go back, that's what I'll try a pho bowl."}
{"text":"La première expérience fût assez positive, mais notre 2e expérience plus récente fût nettement moins gustative. Le pho au poulet n'avait que quelques petits morceaux sans saveur et le riz au porc grillé, était fait d'un riz de mauvaise qualité et de morceaux de porc grillé sec avec beaucoup de \" tirailles \". On n'y retournera plus."}
{"text":"I Ordered 2 Banh Mi,one porc and one chicken with an egg . Total 20$ The taste is delicious but the porc one is very greasy and alot of fat. The sauce is very good. The chicken one is almost delicious. The bread would be better if it is more krispy and thinner.  Nice place to be if you want Vietnamese food with 5 guys in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Walked into this spot on a weekday for lunch and was surprised to see so the place buzzing already! The space is simple, black chairs, black tables and a few stools for the windows seating, nice gray-washed wooden floor, add to a very modern, quaint and clean open space. The utensils are already at the table, as is your choice of condiments. You place your order at the counter, leave your name and grab a seat to get served, simple!   I decided to go with the bahn mi sandwich with pork. As suggested by the friendly cashier, I added the egg. The food was up in a very reasonable timeframe considering the crowd. My first bite was heaven! Really! Perfectly cooked morsels of pork, great flavour, plenty of coriander, moist bread and that gooey egg brought that sandwich to another level! Was it worth the 10$? Yes, yes, yes!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I can come on foot to get a bowl of pho that tastes the same as Pho Tay Ho out in Rosemont.  I'll need to try out some of their other offerings in future visits. But given that they were able to execute well on that broth, no doubt that everything else will be delicious.  The decor is very simple and easy on the eye. Maybe it's the reason for the price premium?"}
{"text":"This is the only bahn mi I'd pay $9 for. Seriously, it's that good. The meat is tender, the sauces are PENG and the ingredients are qua-li-té. You can tell it was made with love.   I can't speak to anything else on the menu, but the PORK BAHN MI will make your day."}
{"text":"I used to complain about the lacklustre Asian food spots in this city, but now I know my new go-to spot. We had the rare beef pho and grilled pork vermicelli. Broth was so flavourful and the vermicelli bowl has piles of meat and veggies. I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"I was just in Vietnam a few months ago and was happy when Tran announced its opening. I've had the beef pho twice now, which is truly authentic and the broth is amazing. Today I had the ban mi pork sandwich and it was also delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is reasonable. They offer a stripped down menu of vietnamese offerings in a design simple venue. Less hectic than your typical (popular) vietnamese joint. One could even call them a miniature apple store version of a vietnamese restaurant. The price is higher than the norm for vietnamese - but not expensive. The quality is solid. If you don't like the feel of most vietnamese places, have some concerns regarding their cleanliness (which may or may not be merited - I don't know), but like the culinary staples (e.g., beef pho, banh mi), this may be an attractive option for you. Personally, I prefer the Pho Bang NY - but this place is perfectly fine."}
{"text":"I was ready to hate this place. A Vietnamese \"cantine\" opening down the street from my place with no pho number, nice-ish wooden furniture, and presumably middle-class white people prices. I've changed my tune. Over the weekend I developed a class-A chest cold- one which could ONLY be helped by pho. Down the street seemed like the most logical option, despite all of my reservations.  First of all, the prices are tax in, making the pho only a couple bucks more expensive than your standard mom and pop pho establishment. The banh mi's are definitely more costly than your typical vua fare but I can't speak to their quality (yet). The pho was on point- as others have described, for take out they give you a giant bowl of noodles and meat/veg, a great big container of tasty broth, and a baggy full of basil/limes/bean sprouts/sauces. For $12 it hit the spot.  For the neighbourhood, I'm impressed by what TRAN has brought to the table. I'll still head to my old school pho resto when possible, but I'm happy to have these guys around. The service is also lovely.  Another bonus: they've veganized the whole menu, with the exception of the pho."}
