{"text":"Another gem at 130 Davis Drive, the strip mall of many dining choices. I was a bit concerned when I arrived and found the place to be completely empty at 6:30 pm on a Thursday. The decor was quite nice though, and I figured Yelp would not have steered me wrong. Several groups did show up just as we were leaving. Maybe people eat Indian later in Newmarket?

The host/server was quite friendly, and he turned on the house music for us, not that I asked. He cautioned my dining companion that the Korma was mild, which is usually the reverse of the typical \"that's hot\" warning you get at most Indian Places. I thought that was interesting.

We ordered a murg (chicken) korma, murg dhaba, both with naan, and a paneer pakora appetizer. The appetizer was pricey at $11, and there were only six pieces. It was good, but definitely not worth the price.

Both curries were delicious; the korma had an aromatic flavour, and was quite enjoyable. I had no idea what dhaba was when I ordered it, and it turned out to be a slightly spicy butter chicken-type dish, which was quite tasty. The naan breads were the show stopper for me. I'm a naan snob, and I was very happy with the naan here. I also ordered mango lassi, my go to drink at Indian places, and I was very pleased with it.

Other than the overpriced appetizer, I was very happy with my meal here, and I'd definitely like to sample their extensive menu in the future."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, on weekdays for lunch. The first time I got the buffet and the second time I ordered an entrée. Both times the food was fresh, hot and delicious. The portion size of the entrée was generous enough to take leftovers home for a second meal. The service was excellent. There have only been a handful of other customers both times so the server (who I suspect might be the owner) had time to answer questions about the food and give suggestions. The food arrived promptly and our glasses of water were refilled regularly. The restaurant was clean, including the bathroom. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hi All,

I cant say enough good things about Abhishek the owner of India Gate in Newmarket.   He keeps the place spotless and always greets customers with a smile. He is genuinely interested in the quality of the food and service and does not compromise either. As a family business he has his name on the Busienss Cards and a reputation to maintain.

My wife and I have been to India and enjoy the spices a lot.  Some Indian restaurants cut corners with the same sauce on different dishes but at India Gate each is different and the time it takes shows through in the food. Indian beer is also on tap or bottle to compliment the tasty dishes. 

The Paneer on a sizzling plate is always great and the kabobs for appetizers hit the spot.  Moving on to Dhall, Currry and Naan to die for it is all excellent. 

Atmosphere is very nice and upscale.  Could Abhishek improve something? I cant think of any burning issue. His location is out of the way in the plaza by Henry's Camera.. So it is not seen from the road.  Deceiving on the outside but very nice inside. Go have a look and you will stay for dinner.

Now some complain about it being a bit pricy.  Well it is not out of line for good food. If you want quality you do pay a bit more for it. If you want cheap you get cheap. This is not a place to try for a $7 all you can eat buffet. If that is your game go elsewhere. But is you want good food give it a try.My wife Sandi and I highly recommend India Gate.  It's worth the drive from Caledon.

John and Sandi, Caledon"}

{"text":"Lousy experience at this place.  Coming in with a bad review here.  Went for dinner with wife, place was empty, should have been a warning sign.  Ordered food and were initially a little surprised by the small portion to price ratio.  

While eating our mains, it came up in chit chat with the owner/server that we lived in Mississauga.  Shortly thereafter, he suddenly appeared at our table with a big smile, said \"more garlic naan for you!\", dropped off additional naan, and was gone in a flash.  We just looked at each other a little surprised, and figured maybe it was something he did for first time customers, or as a way to make up for the smaller portions.  Whatever.  Anyway, as you can imagine, this extra *unrequested* naan magically found its way to our bill.  I do realize I could have asked if we would be expected to pay in the moment - but as a general rule, charging for unrequested food is tacky and lame.  I think anyone who has ever been to a restaurant knows this, and it should be more than obvious to someone actually in the business. 

My thinking is that he figured since we were out-of-towners, we may not be back in Newmarket so he decided to try and sneak in a couple extra bucks for himself while he could.  Fact is, we were there every week for 8 months and explored all kinds of way better local places like the Buttery and Ground Burger (excellent place!)  just to name a few.  I'd like to say he gave up all our future business over a $4 naan order but the truth is there was no way we were coming back anyway for additional reasons.  

The food was way, way too salty and under spiced. Little meat and lower quality overall despite the price.   I also had a view into the front kitchen area from the back (due to repairs) and could see curries in giant deep plastic buckets in the fridge, being ladled out like slop for pigs and microwaved - was both gross and very questionable from a sanitation perspective.  Not fresh.  One can only imagine how long they sit, especially given how dead the place was.  This explained the lack of freshness in the food though.  I didn't bother fighting him on the naan charge when it came time to pay the bill because I figured if he's resorting to tactics like that in his restaurant, he must clearly need the money more than me. Truth is, we were just eager to get out of there.  This was a while ago actually and it's amazing this place is still in business - would not survive in Mississauga, or any other city that has at least 3 or more Indian restaurants.

To make matters even better, they don't accept cash or credit like 99.999% of other businesses operating today - but of course they don't mention this until after you've already finished eating.  Again ,and I could be wrong here, but I can only assume this is to avoid paying the transaction fees, thereby keeping a few extra precious pennies in the owners pocket at the expense of his customers (I mean, who cares about them right?!?).  Not too worry though, although there is no bank machine in the plaza, the owner is willing to wait for you while you drive to a different plaza after your meal to make the withdrawal and return - what a great guy!!  Can I get a round of applause?  How considerate of him!  Can we create a kickstarter campaign to get a statue made in his honour and placed in the town square??  Hope you didn't have plans immediately after your meal.

In all seriousness, I really don't like being this negative, but the truth is everything about this place sucked.  Everything.  If you live in the great town of Newmarket (or are visiting) you are fortunate that there are many places that are dramatically better than this place.  The recommendation from our experience is to stay away."}
{"text":"This is a long time favorite for my husband and I.  We have been coming here for a while now.  We usually get take out but today we came for a nice sit down dinner.  

The take out portions are much larger than when you eat at the restaurant but equally delicious and flavorful.  Their naan is great (go for the Garlic Naan).  

The restaurant atmosphere isn't great, it is usually empty (but take out is always busy).  The server, who I believe is the owner, is always exceptionally polite and gracious.

I absolutely recommend their take out. You will not be disappointed.  My husband usually ordered the Gosht Vindaloo and always loves the spicy-ness.  I always have the Baingan Bhartha from the vegetarian venue...yummy!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the experience was a little awkward. We had to wait for our menus, we didn't get an item we'd ordered (it was just an appetizer so we didn't ask about it), and we had to wait for a while to get the bill. Our server was sitting at another table (eating?) with another staff member/customer. We stood and put on our coats to get his attention and get the bill paid. There are lots of tables, but they're very close together so there was a feeling of claustrophobia. We went a little early in the evening and were the only ones there, and the emptiness of the dining hall and the closeness of the tables made it feel awkward to be the only group of people (aside from the staff member(s) sitting at the other table)."}
{"text":"The food and service are good but my major complaint is that my friend bought me two twenty dollar gift certificates for this restaurant as a gift and the restaurant won't let you spend them at the same time. 

Now I do not understand this as my friend paid cash for the certificates I should be able to use them at once instead of having to spread them out over multiple visits. This simply a bad business practice as I have decided once I have them both spent I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, especially the tandoori chicken sampler platter and tandoori Fish!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Average price.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Cant' get enough of the naan!  Crispy on the bottom, tender, chewy and puffy on top--I can't think of anything better.  They have a lunch buffet that is not very big, but it will knock you down with flavor!  Just enough heat to make you take notice, not a battery acid assault.  On the buffet was fish, lamb vegetables, fragrant basmati rice, but the NAAN!

They bring the naan out separately, cooked in the traditional firebox, with chicken tandoori.  I remember eating in an Indian restaurant in London, England.  Every dish there looked different but tasted equally blistering hot.  My transcontinental flight the next day was an adventure.  But at India Gate, you can taste every succulent flavour.  My guess is that they bring in the real seasonings from India instead of picking them up Metro.

All you can eat, $13, and the naan keeps coming.  And so do I.

Did I mention the naan?"}
{"text":"Today we had a craving for Indian food, so we came here to give it a try. We chose the meal deal for two and in our opinion, it is little pricey: $65.00!

The appetizer we chose was non-vegetarian and the portion was small. Small tiny wings, two deep-fried battered fish and two chicken breast. 

The naan bread was very fluffy and very good! Also the fried rice was good with great mix of herbs, very appetizing. However, the main dishes was nothing special and one of the dishes were too salty. There are many Indian cuisine around, but this is quite decent for a family dinner.

The dessert was a home-made mango lassi-tasting ice cream. With the showel-like spoon made the dessert experience very interesting. 

The place is decorated with Indian wall decor and paintings and I really like the traditional Indian background music.

Overall, we enjoyed our visit and will come back again for its naan bread!"}
{"text":"The service was better today compared to my last experience. I ordered a chai tea & kadahi paneer with naan/rice. It was really tasty and not too spicy at all. 

The wait for food was reasonable and the check out part was a breeze. 

3 stars today & willing to bump it up on my next visit assuming the service is consistent."}
{"text":"The last time we ordered food from India Gate I wasn't happy with the quality and cost of the food at all.  I was quite disappointed and likely wouldn't go back again.  We ordered Hariyali Chicken.  The flavour was ok, however hte chicken was over cooked an it was 12 or 13 or 5 small pieces of chicken which was the equivalent of a chicken breast.  I felt that was too expensive for the portion they were offering"}
{"text":"Found it pricy but the food was good. Enjoyed the butter chicken and didn't have to wait to long. Nice seating areas inside as well."}
{"text":"We ordered take out based on the decent reviews but unfortunately this was not our experience. Indian Gate certainly knows how to charge ... $113.00 for a dinner for 4 .... not only was it overpriced but the quality was extremely poor and the quantity of protein in the meals was a joke   6 small chicken wings for $13.00  and the quantity of protein in each entrée was embarrassing for example the butter chicken may have been 1 chicken breast cut up in pieces at most.... we were embarrassed  as we bought dinner for our friends and they had to be careful of how much food to take .... ...

I hope the owner reads this review and contacts us as deserve one big apology..... ...."}
