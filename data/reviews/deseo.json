{"text":"I rarely go over and over to the same place religiously. Actually, I enjoy change and trying new places and food. Deseo is an exception! Ever since I discovered it about 10 years ago, I go back every time when in the area for its divine ceviche! And everything else that we've tried in terms of cocktails and food."}
{"text":"Dined here for Restaurant Week, Spring 2017.

The entree dishes definitely took the cake. The wagyu shortrib was so tender and tasty and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. The star of the salmon dish was the aromatic rice; the skin was indeed crispy, but it quickly separated from the fish when a small portion was sliced.

The beet and arugula salad was not anything special. If simple was the aim, then they hit the mark. The Dulce de Leche cake was rich and overall good. The chocolate cigar was whimsically plated.

Service was solid, though a bread refill would have been appreciated. I thought it was weird that our server discouraged me from getting a cocktail I had selected; a better approach would have been to satisfy the order and allow me to like/dislike and replace with another drink based on the result.

Location was great, but half an hour into the restaurant, I noticed that the (delicious) smell just lingered all over. I did not find it bothersome, but I did wonder if my hair or dress would smell like that wonderful shortrib.

Overall experience was decent. It's always best to dine with great company."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in one week. Food and service was exceptional. Took advantage of the Westin Kids Club sitting service promo. $60 per kid for sitter with amazing activities. Then we received $50 credit at Deseo.  We have two kids so sitter was total cost of $20 for well needed adult evening."}
{"text":"I really do not understand a single good review about this restaurant. We travel a lot and eat at varying places so I don't think our experience is biased in any way. We went on a Friday after checking into the hotel. Atmosphere was surgical-bright, quiet, and no one was there- think The Shining movie. Server was not bad, but not what you would expect with high end dining. Not that we were in a hurry but he was definitely on stoner time. All of which I can handle. But the food was so terrible we could barely eat it. We started with said 'millionaire' tacos which turned out to be some unknown miscellaneous fish that elicited a gag reflex. The tacos were soft but supposed to be crunchy and the whole thing smelled off. I would call these 25 cent tacos. Or stomach ache tacos. So we set those aside and ordered the seafood paella dish for two for the main meal - it's supposed to be a ceviche place! Unfortunately, we could not eat half of it. The mussels and clams were disgustingly inedible; so chewy and sandy. And it cost a fortune! I would understand paying for something good but this was like emptying the wallet for trash. The only light spot was the bartender at the muddle bar next door, she was great and the drinks were good. Otherwise, NEVER go here."}
{"text":"Deseo was amazing , food and service was wonderful. It will not be our last time there."}
{"text":"Great Latin flair. Food is best in Scottsdale.  Service is spectacular as is food presentation.   Exceeded our expectations for a birthday dinner.  New favorite restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Excellent!! The food was stellar and the service lovely. If I was staying longer I would for sure be back. If you sit at the bar it offers a great view into the open kitchen. They also made a specialty drink for me and it was done just right."}
{"text":"Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic. Waiters are very attentive and helpful. I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back. Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again."}
{"text":"Found on yelp and was very impressed.  Their millionaire's tacos are excellent along with the cigar dessert.  Fun place, good drinks."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed when we were prompted to dine at Deseos after having read  a rave review by Howard Seftel in the Arizona Republic. Before making the 80 some mile round trip with an out of town guest who was visiting, we looked at the reviews on Yelp and were also impressed by what we read there and then made a reservation. Coincidentally a couple of days later I had an email from Groupon offering a deal at Deseo for a prixe fix dinner for up to two, so I purchased it and then called the restaurant and informed them I had a groupon and confirmed that we would be paying full price for the third meal, and asked if that was ok. They told me that the Groupon prixe fixe menu contained limited  selections from the regular menu.
On being seated we were handed a special Groupon menu along with the regular one and we all chose the flank steak but were then informed that regardless of the billing the groupon menu only applied to customers with a groupon. I told them  I already understood that and was quite willing to pay the full price for the third person meal. We were told that the third person order would have to be from the regular menu which apparently did NOT include the flank steak as was on the Groupon menu. As we had driven 40 miles there was not much point in arguing about it so I ordered a completely different item (beef filet mignon). We tossed a coin to decide who was going to have it as we all thought that would be the better meal. I \"won\" the toss! When it arrived it looked like a long cube of meat with straight  and symmetrical sides  along with a very small (tablespoon size) side dish of garnish.  While I realize that filet has a very delicate flavor, this one was non existent and whats more was tough and chewy. The meat from our local grocery store is far, far better. I think that item alone was over $35,  but for that quality was a total rip off. The side dish tasted good what there was of it. I am not a big eater, but was still hungry. However, the Groupon meat was excellent, just as chewy (as one would expect given the meat cut) but with lots more flavor! I was allowed to order similar desert items as were on the Groupon menu, which included a kind of chocolate cigar, and creme brulee, both of which were excellent. The main issue here apart from the quality being that I was told on the phone that the Same menu would be available for 3 people, but the third person would be charged regular price, when in reality it was not available and the third person was required to order from the regular menu which did not have the same items as were on the other one.
If this review is published, I realize that we are in the minority, but the experience was such that we will never return, nor will we ever stay at a Westin Resort. I should in fairness add that the server was very attentive but obviously was restricted to what she was allowed to do to ensure guest's satisfaction. The ambiance and decor though was typical corporate chain hotel which one would accept if the food was good or even average.  The prices charged maybe raised expectations above that of the average restaurant. Pity the food does not match!"}
{"text":"Returned for a much anticipated dining experience we'd had previously. The mini millionaires tacos were still first cabin, but by halibut was just so-so, and the asparagus ordinary, large and tough. Dessert- a sort of panne cotta, was tasteless. Service was very good and attentive, but with so many choices for dining, we may not go back."}
{"text":"My fav ceviche bar!!!! I also love the shrimp and rice dish but for the life of me cant remember what it is called... its been a few years since I lived here."}
{"text":"Deseo is the flagship restaurant at the Westin Kierland resort. It's spacious and fairly quiet. We were there on a Saturday night and it was half full.
The menu is eclectic - Latin touches in most preparations. I had a nice (tiny) empanada with foie gras  and a lovely  sea bass. The dessert - chocolate cigars - was a work of art, presented on a tray like sculpture.
Our waitperson was knowledgeable and helpful. The service was very good but petered out towards the middle of the meal, where no one was in sight and no water was forthcoming. It did pick up at the end.
Overall it's a nice quiet place for unusual fare.
There's a bar next door and a Cuban painter working on mythical large canvases."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried many different things and every single thing was delicious! Must go!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here a few times for a quick dinner, it absolutely never disappoints, you're greeted by the nicest waiters and hostesses. The food is by far the best Scottsdale has to offer, I highly recommend the chicken if it's your first time visiting!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful restaurant with great service and the food was outstanding. Every dish we had was fantastic."}
{"text":"So a group of 8 friends descended upon this place with no clue of latin cuisine but only united by their love for food and desire to try something new. And we weren't disappointed . Everything starting from the appetisers to the specially created birthday desert was awesome . Here are my recos: The lobser cevice as well as the rainbow ceviche are insanely flavorful, the corn chowder is among the best that I have tried . I personally would rank the shrimp chicarron a little lower simply because it was a little on the sweeter side but thats purely a personal taste. 
In the entrees, everyone loved what they ordered so go for the mahi mahi or the halibut or the lamb chops. I was sceptical that this may be one of those 'big plates, small food'  restaurants but the portion size is good. Though frankly, if they only gave me the dinner rolls and the butter , I'd camp happily too. 
The service was slightly less on the 'surprise and delight side' that i would expect from a place this high end but the good food probably makes up for what I am hoping was an 'off night' that our server had. 
Great for a special ocassion, great for trying out something new that leaves you with so many great options to come back again."}
{"text":"What an awesome dinner! We really enjoyed watching the chefs prepare our food in front of us. The meat board dinner for two was awesome! Really enjoyed the variety. Thank you Chef Derek!"}
{"text":"I've only been to the bar here. They make amazing mojitos with an array of different fruits. I told the bartender to surprise me when I ordered my drink, and it was amazing. She put a mixture of fruit along with the mint and it was perfectly mixed. I also had their spicy shrimp appetizer which I didn't really care for. So many other places make a similar dish, but much better. They also serve really good rolls with butter that come out nice and warm. The texture of the rolls are a little unexpected. I think they use tapioca flour as their base. I will definitely be back to enjoy their main dining cuisine."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and fun atmosphere.  Fun for drinks and appitizrers and inside the Westin hotel so good energy especially at night !"}
{"text":"Best civeche I've ever had. Service is amazing."}
{"text":"Shockingly good for a hotel restaurant.. heck,  it's dang good for any restaurant!  We started out with the hamachi ceviche which had just the right amount of citrus - tangy but not too acid - and fantastic texture and flavor.  Could have eaten a bucket of that.  The mango \"muddle\" was similar to a mojito and tasted wonderful.  The bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese empanada were both very pleasing, though though not mind-blowing - I'd be happy to have ether again.  The duck breast on the other hand was indeed mind blowing!  Perfectly cooked (I asked the done-ness to be however the chef recommends), tender and fabulous.  The accompanying poached pear and quince were extraneous - I thought they detracted from the duck rather than enhancing it - but no matter, the duck was fine as can be without them.  The tiny bit of fois gras was delectable - more fois instead of the pear and quince might be even better.  My companions devoured the rack of lamb and a special request vegetarian dish with similarly rave reviews.  The chocolate cigar for dessert was perfect - the cigar is like a luxury Hostess Ho-Ho.. chocolate over a chocolate cake/white filling roll...  but believe me this ain't no Ho-Ho.  We shared it but I could have eaten the wHo-Hole thing (I could not resist the pun).  The accompanying mousse-like item (what WAS that thing?) was both light and rich, creamy and silky... and lovely.

Not quite top notch aspects included the wine-by the glass list - very limited - only approximately 7 or 8 choices each of whites and reds, none of which excited me.  The bottle list was longer, but come on, this is the age of Sheriff Joe and the DUI task force and  the by-the-glass option is critical in my opinion.  Service was ok, but nowhere near the quality level of the food.  The server's descriptions of the food was a somewhat haphazard.  Napkins did not get folded when someone stepped away from the table.  In fact, when several of us used the restroom before dessert was delivered, the busser absconded with our napkins and we were left to tackle the chocolate cigar sans napkins.  Before we ordered we asked if the bill could be split between two couples, and were assured this was fine.  Yet we received a single bill and when we requested it be split she asked us to mark which items goes on whose bill.  What a shame to have this detraction from an otherwise spectacular meal."}
{"text":"One very great meal! 

We sat at the \"ceviche bar\" which really is the dining counter that wraps around the big open kitchen. Its fun to watch the chef and his staff at work, and sitting at the counter our food always arrived quickly. 

We started with two ceviche appetizers. The first was the \"millionaire taco\" -a yuca taco filled with a mixture of lobster, ahi tuna and Japanese hamachi, and the second was the \"rainbow\" which is ahi, hamachi and salmon with white soy and citrus. For our main course we split the butter fish and a nice side of grilled asparagus. A bottle of Comte Lafond Sancerre worked fantastically with our ceviche appetizers and main course. 

Our server (Jinny) was professional and attentive. 

My only gripe was that the side dish of arroz tostado en cazuela (a mixture of rice, jumbo lump crab, peas, corn and asparagus in a scorching hot pot with a fried egg on top) had chorizo in it and it wasn't listed on the menu. I would rather have asked the kitchen to hold pork rather then send the dish back."}
{"text":"Its ahight.....Its in the Kierland which is probably what justifies the pricing, but as a stand-alone restaurant...its manageable. The happy hour special is great - I very much recommend the Mojitos. Good ambiance for after work and even a dinner for two..."}
{"text":"Yay for SPG Restaurant Month with a special priced 3-course prix fixe menu! It just made more sense to try out this new place in the valley and I was happy for the decision :)

Upon arrival to the restaurant, we took a spot at the self-parking and took a small walk into the resort and it was so worth it, you can feel the quietness and relaxation! The restaurant is at the lower level of the main lobby, we opted to walk down the stairway instead of taking the elevator. Reservation was confirmed with the host and we were taken to our table, very modern and contemporary design, with Latin American music in the air, very romantic if that is the occasion.  And we were not surprised there were only a few tables, I bet everyone else  was in front of their TV watching the super bowl.

Now it's food!

Two appetizers - we were recommended by the waiter to have a warm dish and a cold dish, and our choices took the Millionaire Taco and the Squash Blossom Tetilla Quesadilla. Both were very tasty as well as nicely presented, especially the tacos! They were so cute at looking and so delicious at taste! Mixed lobster, ahi tuna and hamachi meat with a chipotle mayo-ish sauce scooped into a small crunchy yuca chip, hmmm, can i have some more? The quesadilla was warm and the cheese was just melting, it's not the typical tortilla you would have, not sure what it is called, but this ones were thinner and attracted a bit of more oil...

Two entrees - 
+Pan seared Mahi Mahi on top of a light broth with some shrimps, shaved calamari and some peas, it also came with a spoonful of freshly grained chili pepper and amarath for some extra spiciness. The dish looked very healthy and pretty with different colors, tasty yet I couldn't say a lot about the freshness of the fish, or the other tastes just stole the fish. 
+'Kobe vaca encebollada' - grilled kobe skirt steak with a strong tomato based sauce on the top, paired with some purple potato with egg and guacamole. The sauce has a mixture flavor of sweet and spicy, and also a little sour? It's definitely not how you eat your typical steak, but be a bit adventurous and see what you think? 

-Two desserts - We felt like this was the final show and you see it! The chocolate cigar and the flan (?) with some fresh berries. They even made a couple of little matches with the cigar! and of course they are all edible! The 'cigar' was made of dark chocolate and very rich, paired with some coffee/caramel ice cream was just heavenly!

Overall our dining experience was a joy. Our waiter was nice and attentive, also knowledgeable about what came to our table. All of the food were delicious with nice presentations, we can't say if these are your authentic Latin food as we are no pro. Definitely a good 'hidden' place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Sit at the ceviche bar and strike up a conversation with the chefs. They are super friendly and the open kitchen is fun for foodies. The ceviche is off the hook! Try the lobster tacos and rainbow ceviche with a glass of champagne or sparkling wine. (they need a tasting menu)  The foie gras and fig empanadas are decadent and both the bone-in rib-eye and chimichurri beef tenderloin are cooked to perfection and flavorful. We need a restaurant like this is Cali!"}
{"text":"Two visits in a very short period of time gave me two sides to the story- one was five star, one four minus.  The atmosphere with the resident artist painting onsite is five star without a doubt.

First of all- MOJITO HEAVEN!!!!  Amaze.  Period.  Order them if you like mojitos or not because you haven't had them like this.

First experience was with a girlfriend and we ordered tapas style.  FIVE STAR.  Million dollar tacos, chevche, and some shrimp heaven dish.  And the rice.  Unbelivable service.

Second night was two weeks later for business.  The service was awful and the chef was out of town.  My tiger shrimp were excellent but my guests lamb was slightly over done.  The bad service tainted it really.

I really can't wait to come back though... Million dollar tacos and Mojitos will always be a top culinary trip for me now.  Gracias."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend on an incredible date to Deseo. While we were there we tried so much good food. We had a steak, a pork chop, a beet salad, ceviche, ceviche tacos, pomme fits (really good fancy potato chips), tres leches cake, and a chocolate cigar. Along with that I tried several of their different South American mixed drinks which were pretty tasty. We were served by the friendly and knowledgeable Geo while sitting at the rail and watching the food be prepared by Chef Derek. Geo and Chef Derek answered all the questions we had about the different drinks and dishes which was very interesting and helpful in deciding what to order."}
{"text":"One star is too many... I sat down at the sushi bar with a colleague to enjoy a nice dinner while downloading details after a full day of meetings... dressed in business attire. After about 5 minutes of no attention from anyone, we asked the hostess for menus.  She asked, do we have a reservation, we replied no and that we were happy just sitting at the bar.  She then proceeds to ask us to get up an return after 30-60 minutes. The restaurant was at best, half filled with no line to get in and the majority of the bar stools empty. She said that \"we cannot accommodate you. I asked why and she replied... \"we're too busy tonight\".  We stated that we can start off with cocktails and order in a half hour... she insisted that we leave. I was just beside myself hearing those words coming from her mouth.  Mind you that this is a Westin hotel restaurant and I was staying at the hotel at $400/night. Ended up leaving Deseo and hotel... grabbed a great dinner at Dominick's Steak House just up the road.  Shame on Deseo for running such a lousy business and shame on Westin Kierland, for that in my eyes, they are directly associated. Would never go to that restaurant again and would seriously consider staying elsewhere, even if less convenient for that a full service hotel requires to have a restaurant to eat in, not be rejected from."}
{"text":"What a waste of time. We arrived at 6:50pm, 5 minutes late. Party of 4. The hostess said that we would be seated shortly that they had run out of menus. We waited for 10 minutes and then told the hostess that we would be OK setting at the table and waiting for the menus instead of standing in the lobby area. No problem. The restaurant was half full, maybe. And they were short menus? After setting for around 10 minutes they brought us two menus and said more was on the way. 5 minutes later they brought another and 5 minutes after that they brought the 4th. 30 minutes to get 4 menus. Really? They were going to have us stand in the lobby for 30 minutes waiting for menus? Setting was better.

   Our waiter was nice but after all was done he was not a good fit for the restaurants price point, cliental and general feel. The support staff were always on top of it, our waiter was not. Every step took a painful amount of time. From the menu issue to getting the check. Setting and waiting, setting and waiting.

   As an aside the food was great. I would love to expound more but after our experience it's not worth my time. To bad.

   And this review might not have even been made if not for the final slap in the face. Our guests were from out of town (we live here) and upon leaving they decided to approach the manager and let him know what happened. He refused to talk to them. What kind of manager blows off the very people who support his job? We had paid the bill and were not looking for any discount or such. Contact was refused. I will not go back again and as a local I will let everyone know about the shoddy treatment the manager chose. He should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here.  I ordered the adobo pork with corn empenada which I really enjoyed.  If I lived in the area I would surely return since there were many more dishes I wanted to try."}
{"text":"From a 12/27 visit - Husband and I were visiting Scottsdale. Saw all the great reviews and decided to go even though we're not \"hotel restaurant\" fans. The space was great. We sat at the \"rail\" and enjoyed the cooking show. The cooks were all engaged and willing to answer our questions about what they were cooking. My husband's food was great, the rainbow ceviche and beef tenderloin were both well prepared and quite tasty. The tuna on my ceviche was perfect but the sauce (Thai basil) was forgettable. Pick a different one. My entree, the cau cau of seafood was really nice ,except for the langostina. It had that mushy texture to it. Everything else on the plate was well cooked and tasty. 
My biggest complaint was the incredibly slow and lackluster service. It took too long to get drinks, too long to order, too long to get our check and way too long to pay. Additionally, it's an open kitchen and more than once, we saw hot food sitting on the line for way too long. The manager on duty seemed oblivious to this as he walked by a number of times. Their shortcomings are quite fixable with a more dedicated staff and attention to detail."}
{"text":"The very definition of an overpriced underwhelming hotel restaurant. Went for the New Years prix fixe. For $95 plus mandatory 20% tip got mediocre food and subpar service. Had heard great reviews so was hoping for much much better. Appetizers were hit and miss. Mostly too sweet. One salad at our table came lathered with dressing. The other was totally dry. Mains were mixed. Fish was poor. Beef was ok. Desserts were blah. Molten chocolate cake was cool in the middle. Like pudding. Ended up $600+ for 4. Great way to end 2016. 2 stars since some dishes were palatable. But really disappointing overall especially for the price."}
{"text":"Good restaurant in Scottsdale.  The mojitos are the best I ever had. The spinach quinoa salad is great. The millionaires tacos are awesome.  The merluza sea bass is the best ( don't make the mistake to tell them that you're sharing that with anybody you are having dinner with because they will only bring you half the portion to discourage people from sharing I guess?). Disappointed to see that they would do that. The happy hour at the bar are pretty good.  Great atmosphere with a very nice helping  bartender."}
{"text":"All the previous reviews already raved about the restaurants fresh ceviche and fabulous dishes such as the Mahi Mahi & the Kobe skirt steak. I just want to add that the Potato Frits con Queso was also delicious. It's light and airy. Great addition with the Kobe Vaca Encebollada. Our waiter was polite and helpful just not warm and friendly. Our experience was more like 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Called yesterday afternoon to make a reservation for two day from yesterday.  No one answered but the greeting said to leave a message for r serrations.  I left a message.  No one called back.  I called today and left another message.  No one called again.  So I called the hotel and was transferred to a concierge who told me that my party was too large to make a reservations with him.  I have a party of 9.  So I called the restaurant again and left another message.  After work I stopped at the restaurant but it was a ghost town.  I stopped by the concierge who called restaurant manager who told him that the restaurant is booked by a large party.  Which is fine but a phone call back would have been great.  Their food and waiter staff is great but reservations is horrible.  I had my wedding at the Westin and that was great.

Update:  A friend called today, which is the same day for which I wanted to make a reservation and was able to make a reservation.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Deseo with my boyfriend this weekend! The chicken pozole was incredible!!! The mojitos were delicious! And the Kobe beef flat bread melted in my mouth!! The server was very friendly and helpful, and let us stay well past closing time! For dessert we ordered the creme brulee and it was soooo creamy and delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good time!"}
{"text":"Sometimes hotel restaurants can hit or miss.  With Deseo, it was a perfectly straight bulls eye for decor, service and refreshingly innovative food.  The decor is lovely and is accented by beautiful artist paintings.  In fact, the Cuban artist whose works decorated the restaurant was standing in the entryway working on three of his current paintings.  The restaurant also serves as somewhat of a pseudo-art gallery as the artists paintings were for sale.  We started with a nice glass of La Madrid Malbec and were also served  delicious little rolls and butter.  We proceeded to order appetizers which included the watermelon gazpacho as well as hamachi nikkei.  Upon having these two, especially the gazpacho, we knew we are in for one heck of a culinary ride.  Our main course included an unbelievable salmon with a spicy rice and wagyu hanger steak with tempura mushroom.   We ordered the cream of corn as well as the potato frites.  The cream of corn was the only misfire. Desert was tiny little chocolate croquettes served with fruit.   I might also add that we elected to sit at the bar which allowed us to get to know the head chef, Derek, who is a friendly genius of his craft.  Highly recommend on all fronts!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best ceviche I have ever had!  The empanadas are the perfect pairing with the ceviche.  Great wine selection too.  Chef Roberto takes tremendous pride in the ingredients, and he spends time telling me about his new dishes.  If you like spicy, the shrimp chichuron is a must have."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner at Deseo located inside the Westin Kierlands.  We started off with a Rainbow ceviche for myself and the wife had the kobe beef tenderloin flatbread. The ceviche consisted of tuna, salmon and hamachi. The fish was very fresh but the citrus juice was way too tart and overpowering. The kobe flatbread was served on a 5 inch disk with truffle aioli and arugula. The lighting in the restaurant was dim so after my wife had a bite of the flatbread her face went from excitement to a rather unpleasant frown. The kobe tenderloin was served tartare so it was quite a shock to her. I gladly finished her flatbread and the kobe was melt in your mouth delicious. For our entrees we also went with a surf and turf theme just like our appetizer. I ordered the grilled kobe skirt steak and she went with the merluza sea bass. No complaints with the kobe skirt steak cooked perfectly med-rare. Unfortunately earlier in the week I had the hangar steak at J&G half the price and I still think it's the best bargain in town at $18. The highlight of our dinner was the merluza sea bass WOW! The fish tasted like it's been poached in butter then pan seared to heavenly goodness. I honestly think it's the best fish i've tasted in my life. Before Deseo my all time favorite was the Maine brook trout served at Arrows in Ogunquit, ME. On the way out I asked the chef if indeed the sea bass was poached in butter first and he replied no. The sea bass arrives daily and they just salt/pepper pan sear in butter then finish in the salamander broiler. So simple for an amazing dish! For dessert we drifted back to our normal culinary self and stopped by Culvers on our way home to Gilbert."}
{"text":"We ate lunch there and ordered club sandwich and soup of the day. Must say we were disappointed in the quality of the meal eating at a high rated resort. The sandwich was cold. The open kitchen area was also noisy with a lot of clanging setting up. But service was good. The food was better at their Flats quick serve take out restaurant."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food and presentation.  Wait staff was attentive and cheerful.  The decor could use a long overdue refresher from its 70s look.  Had the millionaires tacos which were fresh and spicy.  I also had the sea bass which was pleasantly seasoned and accompanied with saffron rice.  Prices are reasonable.  Would return quicker if they'd remodel the dining area and seating.."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The first time I would have given it a 5 star review, but this time I was very disappointed. I ordered the Kobe Skirt Steak because I loved it last time, but for some reason it wasn't as good on this visit. As a side I ordered the red lentils with dates. It was tasty but the dates were overpowering the dish and the consistency was like soup. The waiter's English was difficult to understand and this side came after I ate the entrée. He did take it off our bill without asking, but the restaurant was practically empty, therefore I don't understand why this happened. The bread rolls and butter were fantastic. Could have made a meal of just that. My husband had the Denver Lamb Chops and enjoyed them very much, but was still hungry afterwards. He has a healthy appetite. I wanted to order a dinner salad, but they only have one on the menu, which I had on my 1st visit. It was ok. Nothing special. The purple potatoes were delicious on my 1st visit, but not done enough on my 2nd. Obviously, this restaurant can be great or just so-so. It is not consistent. Not sure, if I will give it a 3rd chance."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  From the mojito bar, to the different choices for cevice, to the duck, its all good!  Its a great adventure trying the latin fushion flavors unlike most have ever tried.  It is pricey, but surely not to miss.  Save this place for your anniversary, for sure!"}
{"text":"My Aunt and I went to Deseo last  night we were happy with our meal as we order  appetizer..And i had rack of lamb which was delicious my aunt order their hanger steak which was equally as good however, We had leftovers So i asked our waiter to please put our meat in a separate container and our sides in separate also. Well when we got home my side which was the rice was on my  rack of lamb which was half of the rack. So disappointed.I could not believe it.. As i made sure to ask separate containers. That sure change the taste of the rack of lamb, Was disappointed as the waiter disregarded our request.  Sharon Filipsik"}
{"text":"Food was very good with lots of different flavors. Our server was excellent sorry I can't remember his name. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"LOVED it!  Went for the start of restaurant week and it was excellent, started off with drinks at the bar (tequilarito-I think) and then dinner and dessert.  The ceviche is killer, I actually ordered the soup but it was just as good just different.  I won for the entree dish though, mom and dad had the sea bass and I ordered the skirt steak,  totally amazing!  Finished with the rice pudding and caramel kahlua sauce.  Great atmosphere, it'd be fun to go back and do dinner and then have a \"cleansing ale\" as my dad likes to call it by the fire pit on the back patio of the hotel.  :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience. Superb staff, great recommendations and marvelous service.
Appetizers and main courses were simply delightful. 
Place could benefit from more secluded seating and dimmer lighting.
Optional outside seating is a nice touch, Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The flavors were nice, but the devil is in the details. First the atmosphere...This restaurant is LOUD and the lighting is bright. Not the romantic atmosphere were expecting. The service was decent, but the kitchen staff needs to get their act together. We ordered the skirt steak and the tenderloin. What was brought to our table was skirt steak and lamb chops. We thought they had the wrong table because the entrees came just a few minutes after we ordered, as if the food was heavily pre cooked. Both entrees went back and about five minutes later came the tenderloin and skirt steak, but the tenderloin was only seared on the outside and raw and cold on the inside. The skirt steak, after being walked around the restaurant and kitchen while my entree was being quickly cooked, was barely room temperature. We sent both entrees back and asked for the  check for the wine. Our waiter offered to have the entrees redone, but to be honest the quality of my $36 tenderloin was poor regardless of the hasty undercooked preparation and I wasn't going to pay that kind of money for a reheated piece of not so good tenderloin. To their credit they comped the wine, which we did not finish, and the food would have been nice had it been warm or cooked."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with an early birthday dinner at Deseo. Sat at \"The Rail\" on a Sunday evening and had an AMAZING dining experience watching and chatting with Chef Derek. We ordered the nikkel ceviche, wagyu short ribs, pork chops, and potato frits. Everything we tried was absolutely delicious; it was hard to pick a favorite (even the gluten free dinner roll was a contender--and I usually despise gluten free...) but my ultimate favorite was the short ribs. Highly recommend. Try sitting at the rail, especially if Chef Derek is working upfront. A wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times. One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. Love the Kobe steak encebollada. The ceviche is amazing! The muddled drinks are always really good, too. I've never had something I didn't like here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Epicurean experience is fabulous and should not be missed.    Delicious different and entertaining.    The chefs are inviting and it's fun to watch this well orchestrated kitchen working.  Get there at 5:30 and enjoy."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a party of three for the thanksgiving turkey dinner at 5 PM and were the first diners to be seated.  I was surprised, but agreeable, when our waiter explained that the meal would be served family style, since that seemed very much in keeping with the spirit of Thanksgiving, Our waiter, however, was the best part of the experience. 

He first brought out three little rolls approximately the size of golf balls and three little bowls of squash soup in each of which was floating a little rice croquet. Having saved room for \"Thanksgiving dinner\" these morsels were soon consumed and the dishes cleared. Our waiter then brought out our main course, displayed on a large wooden board. What we were expecting was a traditional turkey dinner with a south american twist.

 What was presented were three cylindrical objects each of which were about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 6 inches long. One was made from white meat rolled like a brasiole and was wrapped in bacon. The second was supposed to be made from dark meat and was wrapped in what appeared to be the turkey skin. The third cylinder was supposed to be sausage stuffing but was mostly course sausage meat. Each of these was pre-sliced into chunks about  2 inches long and each was dry and lacked any resemblance to traditional turkey dinner. 

This was accompanied by a tiny dish of very tasty potatoes  and a dish of very tasty cranberry sauce the size of the dish that you get at a sushi bar for mixing your condiments. The service and the atmosphere were great but the food as a whole was quite a disappointment. Not an experience we would chose to repeat."}
{"text":"the spa was quite nice though i wouldn't recommend any of the fancy massages.  i got one of the custom-made, origin massages with the hot rocks and i wouldn't recommend getting that one again.  just get a normal massage.  i like that they gave me a fancy stone to take home as a souvenier from my massage.  supposedly has some healing or cosmic properties but i think i would have preferred the healing cosmic healing properties of a real massage.  that said the facilities were nice, the store was pretty cool in particular with the books and oils and lotions.  i picked up some stuff and a book."}
{"text":"The thing that I truly love about Deseo is that the kitchen obviously treasures salt and seasoning. Each wonderful dish we enjoyed was properly seasoned, either with salt, white soy, chiles and the like. The ceviches were all amazingly fresh and balanced...great citrus, awesome garnishes and nice heat when necessary. The empanada, impossibly tender filled with moist duck ropavieja, and the loup de mer was succulent and well dressed.

The cocktails are also very strong in quality and craftsmanship. Caprihnias are my favorite here, but they're most known for the mojitos...which I can attest to their great balance as well.

If you can't tell, I had a great experience here tonight and the other times I ate here as well. Check it out.

The chocolate cigar for desert us gimmicky, but pretty damned solid."}
{"text":"We are Westin owners and were excited about trying restaurant. Food was high quality, but service less than stellar. We spent 140.00 on Groupon and when waiter heard we had one he ripped menus from our hands, gave us smaller menu, never offered us wine, beverage nothing or even checked back on us. Non-Groupon folks served before us. We spoke to manager and he still did not offer us anything to drink. Never been treated so poorly. Groupon or not everyone shoukd be treated fairly and with kindness."}
{"text":"We have a winner!

The best gluten free bread in town (that I've tried), hands down.

The rainbow ceviche was superb and the Hawaiian wahoo was pretty good as well.

The desert was to die for. Crema Catalana with a twist, OMG, delish!

Great service as well and beautiful location.

It wasn't that pricey either, I mean, given the quality and service. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is AMAZING! It ROCKS!! I been here too many times to keep count! The decor looks sweet! This place is so upscale & classy!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. The service is top notch, they treat you like a VIP! I love the lounge area for apps and cocktails prior to eating dinner. When I'm on a 7 day vacation as I'm on now, I go here 2 times. You have to make reservations to get in. One \"major perk\" is the FREE babysitting, you have to show proof of receipt. If I did not show proof, I would pay $60 out-of-pocket, so all-in-all, I'm SAVING $60, and I can have a relaxing dinner with my wife (without) the kids. Expect to spend $150, but sooooo worth it!!"}
{"text":"We ate there during AZ restaurant week, 3 course $30.  We chose Deseo after trying them at Phoenix Cooks.  
 The standouts were  the Pandebono(Columbian Cheese Bread)  we liked it so much I  had the waitress write the name down so I could figure out how to make it.  The shrimp ceviche- I wanted to drink the tomato sofrito when I was done.  The Achiote  Chimichurri  with the beef tenderloin had so many layers of flavor; I've never had anything like it.  The huitlacoche fritters served with the jidory chicken made me a fan of huitlacoche.  And of course the muddle bar is great for fans of mojitos.   The only thing that was missing was the cancha corn with pork belly we tried at Phoenix Cooks.  
We had a great corner table.  The decor was a little lacking, however service was extraordinary.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the ingredients used and gave us the feeling she wanted us to have a fantastic meal. 
Definetly the best meal we have had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food! Definitely recommend this location if you are looking for a spot for a special occasion. We ordered the truffle ceviche, the seafood platter for 2, and the truffle fries as well as an elderflower cocktail. The ceviche was more of a sashimi with cuts of the fish being thick - which was a little harsh to eat as it was a strong flavor, and it wasn't served with any crackers or flatbread. The seafood platter was amazingly presented, but quite oily. The seafood itself was great, but again, the sauce was mostly made up of oil. I would definitely not recommend the potato truffle frites- as they were more of \"inflated potatoes skins\" as my boyfriend called it lol. The truffle flavor is weak, and they were slightly over fried. The cocktail was excellent through and through. To our surprise, they did provide us with a complimentary desert cake for our anniversary. All in all, great ambiance but I would stick to coming here for drinks and appetizers. The meat options may be more promising. Regardless, I would still give a second chance because of the excellent service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Glad we went during restaurant week, because i would have been dissapointed to have spent more for the food.  The presentations were beautiful, but the flavors didn't have the depth i thought they would have for such a high-end restaurant.  

The decor was gorgeous, and had we gone for the experience of the open kitchen, which was pretty cool, it would have been great.  But we went for a good meal and some good conversation between friends, and found it quite noisy.

Our waitress was wonderful!  The other folks, though, didn't even crack a smile...how strange!

Prbably wouldn't go back for a meal - perhaps drinks, though."}
{"text":"I went to dinner at Deseo with my friend while we were staying at my dads in Scottsdale. I am a huge fan of Latin cuisine so when I saw it was possible to get a three course meal for $39 I jumped at the chance.
 
I chose the millionaire tacos as the entree which came with avocado and salsa and really enjoyed them. For the main I chose the eye fillet of beef and was pleasantly surprised at the size of beef served - it was great considering it was part of a three course meal. The beef was served with crab meat (not a fan), equadorian potato (delicious!), some peas and snow pea sprouts. Lastly the desert was just super delicious! I had a chocolate cigar and cappucino ice cream. 

My friend and I sampled each others food and her entree and desert were really nice. Her main (chicken) was huge but wasn't as nice as her other courses. 

The service was prompt and friendly, minus 1 star for the bland mojitos."}
{"text":"Deseo is a special place for my boyfriend and I as we've celebrated many anniversaries and birthdays here. The ambiance and service are top notch and the food is so incredibly unique.

Our favorites are the Millionaire Tacos (this is a must have!!) and all of their wonderful, fresh ceviches. They also serve complimentary Argentinian cornbread-type rolls with the appetizers. So yum!

Tonight our server was Giovani and he was an absolute pleasure. Very prompt, friendly and helpful. To start of, I ordered the Sparkling Rosa cocktail, which consisted of aperol, elderflower liqueur and sparkling rose. It was so light and bubbly! Perfect for summer. 

We shared the beef empanada appetizer, the hangar steak (my personal fave entree) and the Colorado rack of lamb. For dessert we had our usual chocolate cigar. This dessert is so playful and decadent! You truly can't get something like this anywhere else in the valley. 

Deseo is perfect for a special date night! They often have Groupon deals as well!"}
{"text":"We dined at Deseo last night. The food, service and ambiance were spectacular. We sat at the open kitchen \"bar\". It was great watching culinary art being created. Highly recommend for serious foodies"}
{"text":"I went to Deseo with some friends a few weeks back.  On the night we went they had a special, Sea Bass and Kobe Beef.  I am a huge Kobe beef fan.  We all ordered the special, it came with a side of purple potatoes.  We also ordered tres ceviches, Shrimp chicharron, and three different deserts.  The side that came with the special was a waste of time, don't even put it on the plate.  The Sea Bass was good, nothing special about it.  The Shrimp Chicharron was fantastic, and the Kobe Beef was the best I had ever had.  It was cooked perfect and you cut eat it with a spoon.  I now compare every other steak to this and they all come up short.  Out of the three deserts we ordered the chocolate cigar was the best.  The service was great, the atmospher was really nice.  My table ordered a lot of food and I wish we ordered more.  Truth is I wish this place had a tasting menue.  This place is a must try."}
{"text":"This place has the greatest muddle bar ever!!  I absolutely love mojitos and this place makes the best ones in Phoenix!!!  I like to tell the bartender to just surprise me when I go because they always come up with something fantastic!  I think my favorite fruit combos are raspberry and mango with some passion fruit!! DELICIOUS!!!  I can just go to the bar for drinks and I am good!  But then you would miss the fabulous food!  I am obssessed with the shrimp chiccharron and I love the beef tenderloin...my sis loves the ceviche...I am not the biggest ceviche fan, but was pretty good and refreshing!  The atmosphere is awesome and it could not be in a btter place...The westin kierland is amazing and very fabulous!  The staff is very sweet and the chef even came out and greeted everyone in the restaurant 3 of the 5 times I have been there! Of course, you cannot miss the chocolate cigar its fantastic!  try it try it try it!!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here! Sitting at the rail is definitely worth it. The ceviche is incredible and has so much flavor. I also loved the pollito adobado. We used the Groupon as well which made it even more worth it. By far one of my favorite Scottsdale restaurants!"}
{"text":"Fabulous experience with their Thursday chef tasting. For $75 plus tax and tips, you get 3 pieces of their ceviche, a soup or salad, main course, dessert, a mojito to enjoy with your ceviche, plus wine pairing for your soup/salad and main course. The big add here is the chefs teach you how they make their ceviche, and they are willing to share recipes, including their pan de bono, a yucca based cheese bread which is delicious! Highly recommended if you have the time and cash in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the restaurant week menu.  The wine pairings were outstanding.  The stone fruit salad and short rib were outstanding."}
{"text":"I think the restaurant is pleasing to the eyes and the original art work is very nice.  The food was very good with a ecletic variety and a tasting menu choice.   I had a very good beet salad and the beef was excellently prepared with great flavor.  The cocktails are definitely a must here.  However, I gave it a three star rating b/c the service for the price of the food was unimpressive.  We were a party of six and our server treated us like she knew she would grat the bill and she did, not a great move for us to actually return to the place."}
{"text":"A class act, through and through.

The spot itself is warm and colorful with a set off bar, kitchen rail seating, and a wide open main dining room. I chose to sit on the rail and chatted it up with the chef working the ceviche station who was a bright dude with meticulous attention to detail. Fun to watch. 

I had the scallop ceviche (which I've never had raw scallops before). The flavors of the sauce and infusion were excellent. Not sure how I feel about the texture of raw scallops in general, but hey....when in Rome. Pretty rad that it came with Nitro popcorn, too (eat it quick for dragon breath). I also chose to go with the churasco, which was light and bright - a nice spin on a typical hearty dish. The steak was cooked beautifully. I was stuffed for dessert, but nibbled on the signature dessert \"chocolate cigar.\" A fun presentation.

The service was stellar. Even those not my waiter made me feel welcome. The (GM?) Michael connected with me a few times during my time there to talk about the menu and different choices. Nice touches like that can go a long way in hospitality.

Overall, Deseo is a star. The creative menu is presented well across the board. The service is excellent and the atmosphere is inviting but still screams \"modern fine dining.\" I am rating a 4, not a 5 for their wine prices. Frankly, for such a heralded list - it just has too much markup. We're talking 250% type markups. However, an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner!! Michael took great care of us. We ate at the rail and 3 of the chefs working asked us how our meal was and explained any questions I had. Awesome wine options too!"}
{"text":"I've been to this resort for events many times but have never eaten here. The only reason why I had the opportunity to try Deseo late Thursday night is a bit of a nerd's tail. I was driving home from the MIM after an event and the Nissan leaf my business partner was driving ran put of battery range. A quick check on the iPhone and we found the closest charger was at the Kierland Resort. We figured we would plug in, grab a late beer and sandwich at the bar and let the car charge. 

But the bar looked meh so we thought we would find the fancy place every resort has, not knowing anything about Deseo. The wall of 4 diamond ratings was our first clue this was more than a charging stop. 

The only thing keeping me from 5 stars was the decor. It was ok, but very hotel. Pleasant  but not special. Even though we got there at 9 and they were winding down the receptionist was friendly and inviting. As was our server. Friendly but not forced. She was easy to engage in a conversation and was willing to give advice when asked. 

We started with Mojitos. I had one made with tequila. It was well made. Balanced and not too sweet or too minty. 

We skipped the appetizers because we had snacked at our event earlier. But they looked yummy on the menu. 

I had the grouper. I wanted the lamb but fish seemed better that late. It was cooked perfect, covered in an intriguing sauce with just enough heat to be interesting. He side was a collection of chopped up veggies with angel hair pasta. It was even better than the fish. Each bite was a slightly different experience. It all worked well together. 

For desert I had Berries on some flan. It was just as good, not too sweet, and the flan had the right consistency. 

We took our time and let the car charge for about an hour and 20 minutes, more than enough to get home. 

I can't wait to come back with the wife and have a full meal. The wine list is award winning and had some great choices on it. I also want to sample some appetizers. But I won't bring an electric car next time."}
{"text":"We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.   Both were first class.

We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.  One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.  It really was fun to watch the whole process.

We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.  We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.  Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.  They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those.  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!  It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.  As our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.  Well worth it for that delicious steak.

We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.  It's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.  

We look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a stay-cation at the Westin Resort for the weekend and we ate here on our first night!

Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martini's or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isn't better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it! 

We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM!

My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didn't do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay. The rest of our experience with dinner - service, restaurant ambiance, overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING! So we will be back just for a more small bites and drink night!"}
{"text":"Top of my list for the next visit to Scottsdale! Amazing food, wonderful wines. South American food that has me planning my next trip to Chile and Argentina!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Deseo for awhile now, as the Westin is where my Husband and I stayed on our wedding night.  We finally had the opportunity to eat here while my Husband's Uncle was staying at the Westin for a business trip.  The restaurant itself as a really nice atmosphere and has an entrance downstairs from the hotel lobby.  Because you go downstairs, it doesn't really feel like a hotel restaurant, which was really nice.  The restaurant is bid and very well decorated and has a nice view to the grounds outside.

The food we partook in was awesome.  We were all watching our carbs, so we didn't try the bread, which was served before the meal, but it looked great.  I opted for the flat iron steak and the Hubs go the chimicurri steak.  MY OH MY we were both in seventh heaven.  My steak was juicy and full of flavor.  Even the asparagus on the side was amazing.  I ate every bite of my meal as did everyone else at the table.  I'm still thinking about that steak months later.  Though the meal was expensive (due to drinks and entrees) we had a localdines coupon, which offset it a bit.  In my opinion, it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I dined here about 10 days ago with my family and we all were very disappointed.  The food was mediocre at best.  All of us ordered the hangar steak.  Mine was very tough and was difficult to cut through let alone chew up.  The potatoes that were served with it were very plain.  The sauce on top of the steak was good but overpowering.  Our server was patronizing and frankly, rude.  He made us all uncomfortable and when my mom asked him a simple question about how the steaks are cooked, he answered her so rudely that I was tempted to ask for another waiter.  Furthermore, we were celebrating her birthday and he took it upon himself to choose which dessert he would give her with the candle instead of asking her which one she wanted.  We went out for plenty of meals in Scottsdale and this one was by far the worst.  We will not be back again."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: the employer was picking up the tab for this dining experience. My review would be VERY different if I had to pay for it!

The food here is deliciously overdone. The millionaire tacos are piled high with irrelevant and tasty bits of food. The appetizers are tiny and delicately unfilling. The chicken is pounded and ever so delicated breaded and grilled. The water is refilled the instant you go below 75%. The wine is repeatedly suggested, and when you finally take them up on the offer, they have a fine list.

It's a fine place to visit when somebody else is picking up the tab."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have been here about five times and everytime is like the first time! the service is incredible, the food AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!
Second time here in a week.  Probably my new 1st or 2nd favorite upper end restaurant in Arizona!

Service = 4.5 
Food = 5
Ambiance = 4.5
Beverages = 4.5
Wine list = Didn't look
Chef = 5.  Talented, creative and a personality!

I will always take my guests to Daseo!"}
{"text":"Some of the food here was really excellent -- the flank steak and chocolate cigar dessert were stand-outs, and with all South American choices it's an interesting wine list -- but we only give it two stars because of service, ambiance and price.

If we hadn't had a Groupon, which gave us half-price on a 3-course fixed price meal, we'd have really felt ripped off. The ambiance is your basic standard hotel dining room, and extremely loud -- definitely not a spot for an intimate dinner, though I thought perhaps the patio might be better...until we saw all of the children running wild around outside!

Service was really lacking. Initially, we were seated at the bar fronting the open kitchen and when we told the hostess we didn't want to sit there after all (really, there's nothing special about watching a sous chef prep chicken), she was quite put-out and proceeded to seat us at a teeny, tiny table -- so cramped, in fact, that we had them take the candle away so we'd have space for our plates, glasses and bottle of wine. Our waiter was as unimpressive as the hostess -- when he was there, he was pushy and rushed, but mostly he ignored us.

It's a thumbs-down."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!  Well seasoned, tasty and very distinctive flavors.  My Filet was perfect, my son's NY was awesome also.  Their tequila list is the best that I've seen.  I would make this restaurant a \"must\" the next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. The wait staff was friendly and quite helpful. The waiter recommended my new favorite wine. The ambiance is sophisticated but yet casual. The food was delectable and the presentation quite stunning."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Super hospitable staff, the best ceviches, and amazing presentations. A MUST for everyone. You will not be disappointed. Sit at the bar if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Love this place! We started with a Caipirinha and a Kierland Margarita. The margarita was just a run of the mill drink but the Caipirinha was delicious! I loved that it was served with an actual sugar cane. As an appetizer we had the Mixto Clasico Ceviche. Definitely not the ceviche I grew up eating! But wow was it tasty. The sweet potato mash gave it a sweet flavor I didn't realize I'd appreciate. The bread is also worth noting, so tasty. The gentlemen placing the rolls at each table was smart enough to only give us 2 rolls! Thank goodness for him! As the main course we had the Churrasco en Tabla, Grilled Asparagus and Maduros Cubanos. The Churrasco is definitely for 2 and comes with 4 proteins and a heated stone to cook the somewhat rare way the meats are served, 3 Chimichurris and salt. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. The asparagus comes with a side sauce, very good but not needed in my opinion. The maduros, that was like our dessert! As the name implies, they were cooked at the perfect tenderness. I hinted vinegar in the sauce, which I loved, but I may be wrong. Overall, amazing food and service!

We didn't have a reservation and so were seated outside and quite frankly, unless we would've sat at The Rail, I think we lucked out. (That comment will change once our Summer heat actually starts, lol.)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different in North Scottsdale. \"Give this place a try\"  The menu is mostly Latin Fusion. So be open minded to trying something new. The food was delicious, try this place for you self."}
{"text":"The food and drink are appreciatively foreign and artfully presented. The atmosphere was nice but I couldn't hear any music and this would have made for a more enlivened atmosphere. Menu choices are a great selection of meat and seafood. I had the yellow fun tuna and it was fantastic. The yellow rice that accompanied the tuna was unique but I would have have served half the rice along a few asparagus or something.  Veggies and potato are a la carte and you'll need them to feel like a complete meal. I would recommend ordering the lamb medium well and nor medium rare. A groupon would have been smart.  Desserts were  fantastic and also offered in the lobby of the Westin and look scrumptious; however they are uncovered and open to those who sneeze and cough."}
{"text":"This restaurant boost with amazingly fresh food. I have never had a bad dish and the waiter is always helpful to pair your food with the most amazing wines from South America. I recommend DeSeo for a refreshing South American flare cuisine."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Came here for a family dinner and so glad we did! The service, ambience, and food were absolutely spot on. My table ordered the seafood for 2 and the cutting board for 2 and every single item was tender and fresh! The beef tenderloin tasted more like filet mignon! Yum!

Needless to say, we will be back in the near future! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had another wonderful meal on Sunday night. Wife and I split the Arroz con Marisco which was delicious--every bite. A must visit for us every time we are in Scottsdale, whether for a nice leisurely dining experience, or to sit at the bar and dine on ceviche and appetizers."}
{"text":"Seriously, some of the best food I've ever had! Super great. The shrimp appetizer was to die for, I mean it. I ended up having the special of the night, which was lamp chops. OMG! I was so full, but couldn't stop eating it. I practically licked my plate! The prices are expensive, but so totally worth it, especially for a special occasion. I almost forgot...  the bread they give you as a starter thing, excuse my french... HOLY S*$T. I cannot explain to you how great this bread is. I mean seriously, we ended up being the white trash people who asked for one more dinner roll, because it was like 'last meal of your life' type good. (and gluten free for those with celiac - so everyone can try this little bit of heaven)!! Go here on an empty stomach and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!  We purchased the Groupon for the prix fixe dinner *and* were treated like non-couponed folks.  

There are two seating choices for this restaurant - a regular 'ole table or you can sit kitchen-side (kind of like a sushi bar) and watch the chefs prepare.  They're also  happy to take questions.  

We opted for the \"epicurean experience\" which was fascinating.  It does interfere with conversation a bit so if you're having the \"I think we should see other people\" or \"I like your brother in a way that is not condoned in the Bible\", you may want to opt for a table.  

The food was exceptional.  My ceviche-style poached lobster was magic on a fork.  The skirt steak was beautifully prepared and the \"cigar\" dessert is not to be missed.  

The mojitos were outstanding - the right blend of sweet and tart along with a sugar cane stick for good measure.  Service was fabulous.  It took longer than perhaps is reasonable for our dessert to come out but our server explained that the kitchen had gotten a little backed up.  Really, the only reason I cared is because I was anxious to try to much the much touted Deseo Cigar.  It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times avec mon ami BouBou.  Relatively elegant with decent service and good food.  This place was much better at the beginning but has been trailing off a bit since then.  A place like this needs world class service (elegant, professional and intelligent staff) versus Phoenix service (gum chewing air heads, umm like, you know).

The only downfall (although quite funny in retrospect) was being propositioned by a couple of cheap (and novice perhaps?) hookers at the bar and then again in the dining room.  

Did these gals come in from Glendale?  Mesa?  AJ?  

I guess there's a first time for everything.  Luckily they had plenty of champagne for dessert.  

I might try it again on the next visit if Monsieur is so inclined."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant.  I am here for the second time in 3 days.  It was so good the first time I couldn't get the rainbow ceviche, 24 hour wagyu short rib and hanger steak out of my head.  Thought I was in for a repeat tonight but there are too many incredible choices on the menu.  Tonight it was the tiradito nikkei ceviche that blew my mind.  If you are a foodie this is a find"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  Too hot to leave Westin so we decided to just have cerviche and drinks at bar. It was so fantastic we decided to go back the next evening for dinner - EVEN BETTER. The Arroz con Marisco we shared was one of the most amazing dishes we have ever had and we both have been to Spain and had some great authentic paellas - this is the best. Can't wait to come back again and try some other things on the menu. Doesn't look like you can make a wrong choice with anything you order here."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal at the flagship restaurant at Westin Kierland Resort.  Excellent wine list paired with creative and perfectly prepared entrees.  Service was also top notch.  Salad offering was a little light for those looking for some fresh greens, but if you like Ceviche you make up for this element easily.  We liked it sooo much we went back a second evening."}
{"text":"This is a delightfully intimate restaurant with delicacies that will spoil your taste buds for all other cuisine. The Hanger Steak is melt in your mouth superb and their dinner rolls are to die for! Reservations are encouraged but if you manage a drop in, have a seat at their Muddle Bar as you wait for a table. The bartenders are welcoming, knowledgeable, and courteous. Especially Ken [yes he's my husband but as a professional bartender I endorse him without bias. He knows his stuff!]. David, the manager, maintains a very personable presence throughout the restaurant and spares no expense at making sure you enjoy the experience. This place is HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our first date after the little one arrived and we are so glad we chose this place to celebrate our first night of (abbreviated) independence! It really delivered.

We started with the Millionaire tacos which were good, a little too much mayo for our taste, but I can see why a lot of people love them.  What blew our minds was a dish called surf y cesped - wagyu beef, caviar and truffle aioli served on a himalayan salt block - one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  

For dinner I had the salmon - I know, boring salmon - but this was no boring dish. Probably the most delicious salmon dish I've had out, served on top of this delicious green romesco rice.  Hubs had the braised shortribs and they were delicious.

And of course we got dessert! We chose the chocolate cigar which was perfection.

The only con was the decor/ambiance. Given the prices and the sophistication of the dishes I didn't feel the decor was at the same level.  It still had a bit of a hotel restaurant feel. Next time we'll request to sit outside as it looked a little dimmer/more intimate.

This is a must go, the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit dinning here. This visit was to the weekly epicurean night on Thursday where we were able to watch the preparation of ceviche dishes as well as watch the entire kitchen prep dishes for other diners. From start to finish the  dining experience was 5 star."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for apps and drinks around 6. The mojitos were amazing! Highly recommend the millionaire tacos. The shrimp chicharron was good but a little to creamy/rich for my taste.

Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Went for my wife's birthday while we were visiting AZ.  Had a very pleasant evening with good service and interesting food. We enjoyed the Millionaire Tacos and the seafood dinner for two. Food was interesting, not run of the mill resort fare. We would happily go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Deseo on a date night and enjoyed the 3-course pre-fix meal. We tried 2 different kinds of sashimi (the lobster and the rainbow) for the first course, which were so fresh and vibrant.  For our second course we ordered the skirt steak and the lamb, both of which blew us away with the flavor.  All of the items we ordered were fresh, perfectly prepared, and I'm sure we will have cravings for them down the road!  We also ordered an additional side of the crab \"tostada\" rice, which was good, but I don't know that I would order that particular side dish again as it seemed to be lacking crab.  My only real complaint regarding the meal would be the desserts... we tried one of each and they just seemed a little lackluster after such outstanding other courses. I would definitely eat here again and am glad to see many of the hotels now putting their best foot forward with the restaurants that they house."}
{"text":"Deseo is a world class dining experience all the way. The apps selection was abundant and delicious. The entrees were delightful. Staff and management were outstanding. The whole restaurant is very classy and beautiful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I took a lady friend here for restaurant week. The server was fantastic with recommendations and explaining every dish in detail. I don't have a lot of extravagant South American food to compare with but this was some of the best food I've ever had. The sashimi ceviche was amazing! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, with both visits having a couple years in between them. After the first visit, I always wanted to go back, so my most recent visit was highly anticipated.  

Deseo is a great date night type place. The decor is very nice and being at the Westin in Kierland, you can always transition to the outdoor patio after dinner for a complete evening. 

But I will have to admit, my girlfriend and I found the food to be quite hit and miss. 

We started out with some drinks from their famed mojito list. I'm no alcoholic, but when I order a drink like this, I actually want to taste some alcohol. The juice and the mint was too overpowering and all not seemingly to blend well together. 

As for the food, we really enjoyed some of the mini tacos, despite some of the selection being heavy on the mayo, and the ceviche was good as well. We also ordered the crab fried rice, which sounded like a real winner. I'm from Maryland originally where not eating crab is a crime against the state. We couldn't finish it. Instead of savory, it was sweet. Not what we were expecting and frankly, rendered it inedible.

I'll likely go back - the one-two punch of the restaurant and patio is too good to pass up. I'm looking forward to trying some other dishes that will be 5 star worthy instead of my 3 star experience."}
{"text":"As a fan of raw food, I was looking forward to their ceviche. It may have been that we went on a Monday night and maybe they didn't have their best chefs working but the ceviche was sub-par.

Here's what we ordered:
Tres Ceviches (Lobster escebeche, ruby red tuna, lobster, shrimp, scallops, octopus ALL RAW) - It wasn't horrible but for the price, it was pretty mediocre.

Kingfish with Serrano Pesto - The fish was a tad overcooked but some people like it that way. Sauce was great though.

Pollo Asado - Delicious

Lamb Cutlets with Truffle - Cooked perfectly and also delicious.

----Dessert-----

Crema Catalana - This was flan in sherried berries and again, it was sub-par. When I say sub-par, I mean I would probably order it again but the for the price, it wasn't worth it.

Arroz con Leche Patron - This was a real treat. If you have a sweet tooth, this is the one for you. It came with a smoking cinnamon stick and the combination of chocolate and rice pudding was perfect.

Chocolate Cigar - There is nothing they should change about this dish. It was delightful.

---Drinks----

Caipirinha - This is a traditional cocktail in Brazil. It is served with a sugarcane stick. I don't usually like mixed drinks but this one wasn't bad. It almost like the moscow mule of brazil.



Again, I am open to give this place another chance. I guess I just expected too much the first time."}
{"text":"I am pretty sad about writing this review because I used to LOVE Deseo!! Now, my boyfriend and I have pretty much concluded we will never be back after Tonight :( we have been to Deseo tons over the last 5 years or so and have not had a bad experience such as what we experienced tonight. Firstly, they sat us at a tiny table against the wall, the table wouldn't have been large enough for our plates. I eventually asked to be moved one the much larger and comfortable table next to us opened up. Secondly, the service was horrible. We sat there for way too long until the server came to our table (the slow service was continuous the whole time), the server gave me a mojito without a sugar cane stick (isn't this Deseo's little signature?) and a martini for my boyfriend with olives on a napkin, not in the drink (weird) and not dirty as he ordered it. Side note: the Tito's martini was $19, seems a little steep to me?? Especially when it's not even made correctly.. Anyway, the server was pretty absent the entire time, I'm sure he is a nice person but no personality and obviously not a happy server. At Deseo we've always had the best service, this was just so bad, it was hard to figure out and explain, it was like he was annoyed by serving us. Thirdly, and most importantly, the food that is normally amazing just wasn't. The rolls are usually so tasty! A little hard in the outside, soft and moist in the inside and always hot, served with the yummy garlic butter, the rolls were hard and cold :( next the shrimp chichiron is what we crave at Deseo, it is the BEST appetizer, but tonight it tasted like it was sitting out not fresh at all, probably because it was waiting for our server to bring it out to us, I'm not sure. Thank goodness the other appetizers and our entree was good, we had the ahi tuna ceviche, ensalada and the plater for two (lamb, pork tenderloin, beef and shrimp). We ordered plenty of food and were full from the meal, we asked if we could have our deserts boxed, ordered the chocolate cigar and rice pudding (my boyfriend loves the chocolate cigar). I had to take a picture of this because it is SO bad, never order desserts to go, it will look like this! Nothing like what you receive in the resturant. Sadly for a $230 meal, this didn't live up to what is normally to be expected from Deseo."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique food! The small breads they make is made with a special potato which was to die for. We tried 4-5 dishes family style and all were great! The lamp chops and meat was very tender and amazing!!
It's a MUST try place! They also had a great desert for my husbands bday."}
{"text":"Tried Deseo during Arizona Restaurant Week for the first time and was completely impressed. The Westin is already and awesome venue so when you walk downstairs into Deseo, you don't know what to expect. Their bar area has an amazing mojito bar. It's one of the first things you see and smell when you walk in. They have dishes and dishes of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs that they hand muddle into your drinks. even the virgin mojitos are wonderful. 
Try Deseo - you won't be disappointed. It's classy and has sassy cuisine! Dress up - the venue is worth your great heels, ladies!"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable time at the bar. Dennis was an excellent bartender. Very friendly and poured a fantastic drink. Will return. Thanks Dennis for a great time!!"}
{"text":"The plating here is beautiful, and for once they taste just about as good as they look here!

We got the Groupon deal which is a 3 course dinner for two people for about $80.  This is a ridiculous deal and if I'd known how good this place is, I would have gotten 2!

For the first course we got the rainbow ceviche and the lobster one.  Rainbow was phenomenal - yellowfish, tuna all stacked in a little cylindrical pile with slices of jalapeno and some watercress on top.  The magic though is in the citrus liquid that fills the bowl.  The taste changes the longer it sits there - if you're a fan of sushi, you will probably like this dish.  The lobster escabeche was slightly different - poached lobster in the middle and fried avocado and yucca chips in a broth of its own.  This one was pretty good, however, the lobster was a bit overcooked and I didn't think the chips really added anything.  Round one goes to the rainbow ceviche!

I got the kobe skirt steak which I thought was seasoned beautifully.  It's cooked well but is still pretty juicy and tender so I didn't mind.  The tomato topping was a nice vacation to renew the dish, but very subtle.  The potato slices with guacamole were decent.  My friend got the lamb cutlets which arrived kind of cold to the table which he was not happy about.  The chimichurri that comes with it is also very sweet which he didn't appreciate.  I thought it was a nice mix of flavors, though the portion wasn't very much since half the lamb cutlet is bone and fat and you only get 2 per plate.  Definitely not a gut buster, but delicious.

For dessert we got to try the chocolate cigar which had a fun presentation.  The cigar is very rich and chocolaty, and the cappuccino gelato that came with it was delicious.  The crema catalana was more my speed with a little creme brulee/flan type mold on a bed of berries and fruit syrup accompanied by a spoonful of coconut tapioca.  

The complexities of these dishes are tasty and fun - as you incorporate different combinations of bites you get a totally different flavor experience.  The grounds are immaculate and well designed without feeling too stuffy.  The service was excellent and very attentive.  All in all, this was a very positive experience for us and though the price tag precludes it from being a regular stop we will very much enjoy frequenting this restaurant for any happy occasion in the future."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the 5 stars.. If I could give this place 10 stars I would! 

This is my wife and I's favorite place in the valley by a long shot! We have eaten here on multiple occasions and even had our reception dinner here. The atmosphere is really cool, local painter painting by entrance that is one amazing painter btw, view of golf course, bar area, and intimate setting through out. The prices are a little steep but the quality and presentation of the food is superb!

If you've never eaten here and wanting to know what to get I will help you! This will be your favorite place after you have this setup! 

BE PREPARED TO YOUR MIND BLOWN! 

Your pick of Cabernet Sauvignon
 
Starter
Lobster Escabeche

Dinner
Beef Tenderloin \"churrasco style\" Medium cooked

Desert
Chocolate Cigar & cup of coffee or scotch!"}
{"text":"I spent A LOT of MONEY tonight at the Westin Kierland and it was TERRIBLE. I should never have gone. I wanted to give a special treat to my daughter and her boyfriend who is visiting PHX , my son and my wife who works so hard all year long. But,I am really dumb. I could have saved the $ and the aggravation:
We had the WORST meal in Deseo tonight. Got to our reserved table (there were 5 of us reserved) but alas only 4 seats. I stood for about 8 minutes while they got another chair (reminded me of eating in Neidick's in NYC as a kid except the bill was 25 cenbts for an orangeade and hot dog which was far more satisfying than the rubbish we sort of ate tonight). It took 2.5 hours to have a price fixed and menu fixed meal.(How hard could it have been to prepare the few choices that were offered?)It took so long to get served that I developed more gray hair and facial wrinkles between courses. Good soup, good appetizers, AWFUL salad, Lobster main was room temp and tasted like a mistake I once made at home.I didn't say anything initially bec. we had a guest visiting fr. out of state but he (as my dgtr. and wife) did not finish the lobster and he was nauseous. My son and I could not finish our meals either. The deserts were at best OK. I will NOT tell you what the charge was per person, but I was a FOOL to have gone to the Westin and you would be too to eat there.The server was apologetic throughout the meal BECAUSE HE KNEW!!!!!!!!!! They took 20% off my bill after I finally complained to some guy in a jacket.. It hardly compensated for my guest's nausea since we have left. Thankfully I had bought food at Costco earlier in the day and for the others I cooked them some mussels and pasta so they could satiate their appetite. We had eaten at Deseo before but this was no \"off\" night. Most of the meal would have bested at IN and Out Burger. The \"chef\", Madrid, needs to taste his own food in the tepid temp it was served over 2.5 hours! (I will supply him with Antacids and medication for nausea. Afterall, I am a doctor!)"}
{"text":"This plac is amazing.  We went during restaurant week and had a wonderful three course dinner.  I have celiac disease and they were very accomodating.  Their dinner rolls are gluten free and so delicious.  They sent me home with four rolls."}
{"text":"If you're looking to splurge on a nice meal for a special occasion or something, I can't say I'd recommend this place.  After seeing chef Douglas Rodriguez on Top Chef Masters I was totally psyched to try Deseo during restaurant week, but it was a bit of a disappointment.  From the carpeting, to the total lack of decor in the actual dining room, to the personality-less server, I couldn't forget I was in the basement of a hotel.  I think there were large windows but they were covered with heavy curtains so the place has a very closed-in feel.

The food itself was decent but I wasn't blown away.  The goat cheese empanadas needed more of the beet chimichurri sauce that was lightly drizzled on the bottom of the plate.  The chicken didn't have a ton of flavor and the jicama salad had an overpowering lime taste.  The salmon was fine but the lentil thing that came with it had a weird pulpy texture.

Dessert did not disappoint.  I would recommend the chocolate cigar (very rich chocolate!), which comes with a cute little glass of delicious cinnamon gelato.  The creme brulee was nice and light and came with a generous serving of mixed berries."}
{"text":"Accompanied with four fellow foodies we hit Deseo for Restaurant Week.  I'm glad I ended the week with Deseo because nothing could compare.

I started with the ceviche, a perfect start to any meal, the fish was fresh the sauce was perfect, it didn't over power the taste of the fish which most sauces tend to do.

Second course- Kobe skirt steak, cooked perfectly on a bed of onions, so tender, so flavorful (complete opposite of the kobe steak I had at Bourbon)

Third Course - chocolate cigar and chocolate gelato, not too rich, perfect pairing excellent finish.

I went to three dinners during restaurant week and Deseo was hands down best from start to finish.  Also, it was the only one that didn't make me feel like I had to roll myself home.

Worth every penny of their regular menu."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is incredible!  We enjoyed the unwind hour at the lounge and had a great experience.  $6 muddled drinks and select wines...the sparkling rose was great!  The shrimp chicharron was to die for...so flavorful and just so tasty.  Best appetizer I have tried in a very, very long time!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. We will definitely go back. The service was first class. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the most amazing food I have ever had. Sit at the rail and prepare to be amazed. This isn't food, it's art!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly suprised my wife by taking her here. Million dollar tacos, ceviche, lobster, rack of lamb and chocolate cigar were all yum."}
{"text":"Great South American cuisine. The Kobe skirt steak is amazing as is the chicken soup. Don't miss out on the columbian bread...it's incredible."}
{"text":"Delicious Tex-Mex style food, with large portions, and good presentation!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, and wow!
Great food along w friendly service in a relaxed modern setting. 
Beef tenderloin was excellent.  Def order the millionaire tacos. Great ceviche dishes. Coco mo mojito was flavorful. Chocolate cigar for dessert was rich and yummy!
Great place to tk out of town guests. 
Def will be going back ;)))"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We had the Millionaire tacos as an appetizer and Churrasco (grilled Beef tenderloin and large Jumbo shrimp) for dinner. Supplemented the meal with Potato Frits. Everything was great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner her with my boyfriend and grandparents the food was all very good and the setting was beautiful. 

We had two plates of the chicken, the kobe steak and the mahi mahi.

The cigar cake was delightful and my grandmother found it very amusing that we ate a book of matches 

The downside was that the music was way too loud and we had to yell at each other all night even though we were sitting right next to each other"}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon for a 4 person fixed price dinner.  $184.00 
Once we added one of the least expensive bottles of wine and 2 sides, including taxes and tip, the bill was $400.
What a waste of money.  We will never go there again.
The restaurant was empty.  The food, although beautifully presented was
overcooked ( steak and pork).  For $400 in Phoenix/ Scottsdale
you can find much better food in a better environment.
So, take it from me, don't waste your time or you money.There are much better and more reasonably priced restaurants with great atmosphere and wonderful food at half the cost."}
{"text":"400th review!


Te desean, claro que sí que te desean
Como yo te deseaba antes de que mía fueras
Te desean, te desean...

Yes...it is that sensual.  The background music has an intoxicating allure, even before you get to the irresistible temptation of the Latin-inspired cuisine and libation.  Dress a little sexy to whatever suits your mood...cause you're so smooth.

We were seated at a cozy booth overlooking the rolling grass hills.  All I could see was the server's lips moving as I try to make out what was coming out of her mouth.  I couldn't focus, so I ordered what everyone was raving about-Millionaire Tacos for starter.  My sexy date whet his whistle with a Passionfruit Mojito and I, a Caipirinha (both so good).  Sugar cane stirrers are ingenious!  I have been known to eat garnishments as I chewed on the cane...do not do it.  It's pithy , will get stuck between your teeth and ruin a good night kiss...or more.  *wink*

The bread are these dense spherical things that make a \"thud\" as it hits the plate.  I looked at hubby and laughed...don't be fooled like I was, they are delicious little cheesy corn baked morsels. As I mentioned, the Millionaire Tacos are a must!  You  get five little yucca chip shaped tacos filled with lobsters, scallops, shrimps tossed in aioli.  I wish I had ordered two, I'd be happy with that and a mojito.  I was being lady-like and had him finish the last one.  I was a little disappointed in the choice of fish:  Mahi Mahi and Halibut.  While they are both excellent fish, I was looking forward to a Snapper or Chilean Seabass, even Corvina.  Alternatively,  I had my mouth watering for the Camaron Enchilado (jumbo shrimp), arepa (soft griddled corn cakes) and drizzled with rocoto (pepper sauce with veggies and bay scallops).  I wanted to sop up the gravy with a crusty bread!  My date turned his hunter/gather mode and tore up the Kobe Vaca  Encebollada with huancaina potato and oven-dried tomato topped with micro greens.  The meat was spiced nicely and so tender.
He paired it with a Merlot while I was still sipping on my caipirinha.  We got a side of Peruvian purple potatoes.  I wish we ordered the Arroz with lump crab for two instead.  The couple right next to us was sharing that and it looked appetizing.

As a special occasion, our meal was complemented with a Chocolate rum cigar and capuccino gelato with white choco matches.  My hubby thought the cigar was real when they set it in front of us...giggle!

We walked out of there Über impressed with the service, execution of the food and ultra chic and sexy ambiance.  We're already planning to head back soon to sample more of their ceviches and muddled drinks."}
{"text":"This is a greatly over-rated hotel restaurant with average food. The ambiance is romantic and wonderful and the service was that of a higher end restaurant. We tried the Millionaire Tacos which are really good, but heavy on the mayonnaise. The Ruby Red Tuna ceviche was excellent. 

We decided to order small plates and I was super disappointed in the Shrimp Chicarron which is lightly fried rock shrimp in a sweet sauce. This is supposedly a signature dish which is really odd. Rock shrimp and a small step above Oregon shrimp or Bay shrimp in quality. Frying these and putting a \"General-Tso-like\" sauce over them did nothing for me. Somehow, I thought the genre was Southwest and this is about as Southwest as a Won Ton.

We then tried the kobe beef tenderloin on casabe flatbread which was ok, but not wonderful. The maduros cubanos which are the plantains were my favorite item. 

All in all, not really Southwest and not all that great. 

Parking was free, though and the restaurant was not super expensive."}
{"text":"I have eaten here so many times, I can't remember. Been a fan since day 1. Yes, it's a hotel restaurant. Yes, it's $$. But , oh wow, do I love Deseo. the service and the food are just awesome. I have never been here when it wasn't just amazing and I live here. If you are staying at the hotel, do not miss out on dining here."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE deseo Modern Latin Restaurant. (located in The Westin Kierland Resort and Spa) I've been here several times since my last review. Always loved the food.

Times have changed. The long time Chef has been replaced, the menu has changed some, the help seem to be spread more thin.

In a nut shell the food I tried was hit and miss....Some things were great and some things not so good.

We started with a Hamachi Appetizer called Tiradito Nikkei. This was among the hits. This was a delicate fish appetizer that was balanced with delicate flavors. Very good and light.

We shared a side dish of Peruvian Corn called Pastel de Choclo. This dish was not palatable to either of us. The textures and taste were hard to swallow. I don't know if it was just for an acquired taste or if it was just horrible. I wouldn't recommend this one.

For dinner I tried the Wagyu Hanger Steak. I thought it was a very large portion of steak. The steak was ok and the potatoes were really great....Over all it was a ok dish....but just ok because the only thing I'd want to eat again were the potatoes from this dish. 

My husband had the 24 hour Wagyu Short Rib. The rib was tender but not succulent with some black garlic flavor. Sadly this plate takes a nose dive when we talk about the horseradish potatoes and jalapeño chimichurri as both were extremely weak. 

I usually eat my dinner so I never had room for dessert before.  I finally got to try the dessert cigar. It was the highlight of the evening. The presentation was a solid five stars and the cigar itself was absolutely delicious! 

At least dinner ended on a sweet note!

Parking is different from my last visit. To self park you now need to validate."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Open style kitchen so you get to see the chefs cooking. 

Appetizer. We got the shrimp chicharron, millionaire taco, the lobster escabeche. All were delicious! But the favorite at the table was the shrimp. 

But the showstopper was really the entree. I split the churrasco for two with a friend. The presentation was great. And the food....just heavenly. Both the beef and the pork tenderloin were tender and just cooked to perfection! 

As other reviewers have already said here, the chocolate cigar dessert with cappuccino gelato is definitely one to get. Presentation is gorgeous and a nice dessert to end with. 

Go try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Deseo, meaning Desire in Spanish, is conveniently located inside the Westin Kierland. A Latin American cuisine with a list of extensive South American wines. We called in reservations from our hotel room and after a day at the pool we had dinner at the restaurant. Service and food was excellent. I ordered the Margajito which used tequila and had Norwegian Halibut Nikkei for dinner. My meal was perfectly cooked and great flavor. The alcoholic beverage was strong. They also asked if we were interested in having bread before our dinner.  The dinner role was gluten-free and incredibly delicious.  It's intimate and also good for groups. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to second Jesse J's comment about this place and add another Woooooooow to the list.

Been here twice now and each time i have left full, delighted and taste bud happy. My favorite things on the menu are probably the appetizers with the millionaire lobster tacos and mixto cerviche being melt in your mouth good. The shrimp chicharron have a nice little kick to them that is offset nicely with the endive.

On my most recent trip I got a main course of the mahi mahi with calamari. It was fantastic. I wish I could describe all the flavor combinations but there was just such a rich blend I couldn't even begin to do it justice. The fish was perfectly cooked and I was a happy camper.

For sides I highly recommend the arroz tostado en cazuela with the crab and asparagus making a great and tasty rice dish. There is plenty to share so it says for 2 people but if you have a few people and another side there will be plenty since entre portions are generous.

The dessert is the best part with the white chocolate cigar (dusted in coco powder to look like a cigar) and expresso gelato being one of the best desserts I have had at a restaurant. What was really cool was since I was there celebrating my graduation and the waiter knew he told the chefs in the back. They decorated a piece of chocolate garnish with congrats on it (I will add the photo).

Top this all off with a quiet and nice setting in the basement of the Westin and you have a winner. Seeing the artist paint live in the entry hallway is a cool little extra.

it may seem odd to have dinner in a hotel basement but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Disgusting dirty filthy overpriced hotel joint. I can't understand why you want to eat here. The place is filthy. Dirty glasses with this disgusting rice shit, ewww. I should've never eaten here, I would rather have a carry out pizza or mcdonalds over this place."}
{"text":"Incredible! No other word for it! Absolutely delicious and well worth it! Lovely ambiance and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"This is a hotel restaurant.  They mention organic and natural- not sure that was showcased under the salt, oil and chiles.  Heavy handed fare- I like it hot, but server didn't offer any guidance that rib eye was lip searing.  Duck was poorly prepared- I might have been the first person to ever order it.  Ceviche tacos were OK but literally I only had one bite- stingy portions, mixed with mayo ick. Save your money and order a burger at the pool.  The Nellie Cashman restaurant next door was very fresh-especially produce."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent!!! You can't go wrong no matter what you order. 

Our group of four tried pretty much every ceviche on the menu. All outstanding. Service was excellent too. 

Best place to sit is at ceviche bar."}
{"text":"Did the 3 course groupon thing. Other people have articulated the food better than I, but just a perfect meal. For a mainly innovative seafood type place, the skirt steak is about as good as it gets. Thin, tender with a tomatoes onions flavor. The mahi dish, great, with shrimp and thin slices of calamari floating around. The memorable thing about the delicious ceviche is that the portion is really substantial for an app. Millionaire tacos, no idea what's in there, 5 little guys and delicious. Famous chocolate cigar still is great even after having it a few times. They also appreciate you being there."}
{"text":"Love this place for its quality in service, food and romantic atmosphere! We come here regularly for special occasions, and they never let us down. They also have an option for wine pairing for about 30pp for each course during holidays like Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Upon walking down into Deseo... the sleek, modern, sexiness hits you like a ton of bricks.  The fabulous artwork and candles beckon you to let your senses come alive and prepare you for a stellar dining experience. Ambient and classy atmosphere.

Wonderful Ceviche choices, I had the Ahi Tuna lollipops *mmm*  infused with Mango, grapefruit & coconut, melted in my mouth .

My entree was The Beef Tenderloin & Crab it had some Cuban flare in the Mojo and served with Peruvian potatoes,  and a zesty horseradish chimichurri,  which just adds something to a great beef dish in my opinion. This dish was beyond well prepared and presented and every harmonious bite had to be savored .

A heavy wine list, I had  the Malbec  Layer cake (so good)
My nectar grande Mojito was perfect too .

Dessert was the Chocolate Cigar and Cappuccino Gelato what a fun & delicious dessert this was .

Service was excellent and my meal was absolutely wonderful in this Absolutely Fabulous Sexy  dining house .

5 stars for  a stunning, sensual, sleek, ambient dining atmosphere !
5 stars for service !
5 stars for well prepared & presented food !
5 stars for a solid wine list !
5 stars for the dessert !

I suggest making reservations .


***Update****
Not much to add to my original review .
Deseo is still fabulous ..The Beef Tenderloin is still incredible. The Paella is some of the best I have ever tasted in the U.S.  
The Millionaire Tacos are super good .
The service ,quality of food, and beautiful presentation coupled with the ambiance, and overall excellence this restaurant has consistently shown is worthy of another 5 star review from me .

Bottom line ; Fabulous !"}
{"text":"Talk about a special occasion.  At deseos prices, we won't be back unless we win the lottery.
The food and service were excellent. Another plus? When so many other restaurants have tv's to distract you, you won't find any distractions here.
We were recommended to try the shrimp chicharonnes. It was a textural wonderland. Crunchy sweet, but creamy spice with slivered jalapeños. 
Both my wife and I had the sea bass (not Chilean btw). Mine came with 2 large delicately cooked filets, skin on, and buttery delicious. 
We rounded out the meal with the cigar desert and it lived up to its status.

We left feeling extremely full and satisfied. This was definitely a splurge for us, as it is not amenable on a middle class budget to eat here regularly. But service, food, and ambiance was worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, so when I saw that they had a Groupon for a prefixed menu I was really excited. Everything sounded amazing on the menu and I figured it would be a great way to enjoy dinner there again. We finally went last night and I was very disappointed with the service we received. I felt like we received substandard service because they knew we had booked with the Groupon and that they already knew we wouldn't be spending a large amount of money. Our waiter was not very attentive to us and I was really disappointed when I finished my cocktail during appetizers and he never asked if I wanted another, let only did I have a chance to ask as other people cleared our plates and brought our other dishes throughout service.  In fact, they brought my husband the wrong entree and then he had to wait about 5 minutes before they brought the correct one.  And speaking of cocktails, for $13 I would expect a little more drink and a lot less ice filling my glass. 

Regardless of the sub-par service the food here is always amazing. Deseo has our favorite appetizers in town and we would go back again just for those. I had the Millionaire Tacos which were to die for and the rainbow ceviche was amazing and all the flavors worked perfect with the sauce it was in. The rolls they give you are yummy and I wish they would give you more than one.  The entrees were good but nothing too memorable stands out for them but dessert was amazing. The Chocolate Cigar is an awesome display of deliciousness and was also part of the selling point for me to buy the Groupon as I love getting that every time we come.  

I will eat here again, but only because of the food. If it were based on the service I received I probably would not, which is why I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I live in Kierland and have wanted to try Deseo for awhile, Im glad I did. To start half price mojitos in the bar, then dinner, make sure you ask for the (RAIL) think Food Network. Chef Madrid knows his stuff ask him for his opinion, ceviche is the best in town, get the Cigar for dessert make sure you ask for Sara to serve you, she is attentive and very knowledgeable plus easy on the eyes ;)  A++++"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westin Villas and used a groupon for the 3 course fixed prix option. It appeared to be a better deal than our owner discount. What an absolutely lovely evening we had for our $89 groupon!!
We started with 2 appetizers, both ceviche, one with albacore tuna that had an avocado mousse, the other, yellowtail tuna with a champagne sorbet. Delicious and beautiful does not begin to describe it     That and their decadent rolls and my hubby could have died a happy man. But that was only the beginning... the wagyu skirt steak melted in your mouth like butter, so wonderfully marinated. We also shared the mahi, lightly crispy in a light flavorful broth I couldn't allow to waste. Yummy! Dessert was over the top. If your a fan of chocolate, the chocolate cigar is a must, rice pudding was really good too with its caramel sauce, but I'm a chocolate fan, and it's rich enough to share, especially with the accompanying cappuccino mousse. A very memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Really superb food and service. Drinks were very good. Halibut was fabulous.

Sat at The Rail and really enjoyed watching the chefs work their magic.

Ordered a trio of ceviche, each one was better than the last. Enjoyed the beef empanadas and the shrimp tempura. The sauce was amazing.

We had the Kobe flank steak and the halibut for our main courses. Both of which were excellent. I've lived near this place for years but it won't be years before I go back!"}
{"text":"Strangest dining experience ever.  Service was bad!  Server kept wanting us to order more food although we ordered grilled combo which was plenty for two.   The corn was so bizarre!  I think this restaurant is confused.  Trying to be something it is not.   Although it has a lot of awards just did not do it for us!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Deseo.  Our first was on Valentine's Day, where a fixed price dinner meant we could not use our Localdines coupon, but we didn't care.  It was an incredible meal with outstanding service and we couldn't wait to go back.  The meal we enjoyed Saturday night was not quite as exceptional, but it was very, very good nonetheless.  The service was still excellent and the Rainbow ceviche is to die for  (And DH HATES fish, so to see him devour ceviche is like this amazing moment!)----we only wish it came with a spoon, so we could have scooped up more of the delicious citrus-y juice that accompanied the ceviche. Instead, we sopped it up as best we could with the delicious yucca flour rolls.  That was the only \"low-point\" in the service---we asked for extra rolls and the server was disgruntled and almost tossed the rolls on our plates.  And those yucca flour rolls are so exceptionally, incredibly good.  If I knew where to get yucca flour, I swear I would try to make them at home, if I was any sort of baker.  Just beyond delicious!  So don't be stingy!   We started with the Rainbow Ceviche, which I think has Ahi and Calamari and Salmon with a touch of jalapeno and a sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds, so it is as beautiful as it tastes.  DH ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled skirt steak and I ordered the Yuca-Wrapped Dorado al Ajillo.  The plates that arrived swiftly to our table were beautifully presented----I really do believe you eat with your eyes as much as your mouth.  They totally had eye-appeal.  

DH said the flavor of his meal was wonderful, but he hated the quality of the steak---he discarded quite a lot it as too chewy and fatty.  He said the flavors were so wonderful though, and he thought it was just the nature of the cut of meat, and that next time if he ordered beef he would go with the tenderloin or else try the pork or chicken. The potatoes were so delicious, he wished for a larger portion.  My fish dish was incredibly tasty, beautifully browned to a crisp finish, albeit the tiniest bit overcooked.  And I have had gloriously browned fish that was perfectly moist and tender, so I just think it was a tiny misstep by the kitchen. The amaranth that came with it was so unusual and delicious---I can't even describe it except---yum!  I wanted more than the soup spoon (it literally came on a soup spoon!) quantity they gave you.  There were tiny flaws in execution, but overall flavor and presentation was wonderful, so I have to give it four stars because we are totally fans and totally going to be back.  We didn't order desert but the after-dinner coffee rocked though---wow!  I was bright and bushy-tailed after one cup despite a big meal and several glasses of wine!  We don't care for the South American wines too much, but it is a South American-themed restaurant, so it is what it is, and after a couple of glasses, who cares?  Our server Jason was very good---attentive without stalking. The service at Deseo is top-notch.  If it hadn't been for the bread guy being kind of surly when we asked for a bit more bread---oh, and then when we were trying to get every bit of the delicious ceviche juice (is that what it is called?) he kept trying to take the dish from us, even while we were dunking our bread bits into the sauce!  Go away!  (Actually, it's a good thing he did eventually carry the dish off, or we may ended up just drinking the juice from the plate---yes---that good!)

All in all, another very lovely experience and we will totally return every month or so, just for the ceviche!  Actually, DH---the man who HATES fish---said he wouldn't mind just coming in for a dinner of ceviche and yucca rolls!  (Who are you and what have you done with my real husband?)  I felt the prices very reasonable---actually, less than an Italian restaurant (disappointing!) we went to last night and a million times better in all aspects---taste, service, and ambiance.  And the Kierland Westin is a gorgeous resort---take time to stroll through and admire some fabulous art!"}
{"text":"I'll just come and say it. We LOVE Deseo. We have been coming here for years and never had a bad experience. High end and high quality. The servers are all excellent and know the menu and preparation well.          Perfect meal would be Raibow Ceviche, Shrimp Chiccarone, Big Eye Tuna or the Hanger Steak.Then the chocolate cigar for dessert. 

Time has passed since that review. And the old chef was still there.
No more. Lots of new faces. Enjoyed the food at the transition period. But we feel things have gone down. Not the terrific professional service.
Just the choices on the menu, the preparation and all those wonderful main course dishes.it is a shorter not to well thought out.and you hardly ever run specials anymore. One more thin, for Restaurant Week, cevichewas not on the menu?you would think you want to promote it. Oh well, things change."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westin Kierland, and this was simply the highest rated restaurant we could walk to - and walking was necessary because we drank a huge bottle of champagne in the room prior to beginning our adventure.  The hostesses sat us up on the rail - allowing us to watch the kitchen - which was really incredible.

We ordered a couple drinks, then shared the shrimp appetizer - which was both sweet and spicy.  Then, we noticed these tiny millionaire tacos that another guest had ordered and our mouths started watering.  The chef noticed, and totally made one for us on the house - which rarely happens.  They were amaze-balls, and something everyone should put in their mouth.

The main course was pork three ways - and the pork belly was good enough to slap yo mama.  Holy pig.  Seriously, some of the best pork we've had to date.  The other two were good as well, but that damn pork belly.  Phew.

For dessert, which we really didn't have room for but couldn't say no based on how perfect the rest of the meal was, was their chocolate cigar.  Just get this dessert.  Do it.  Actually, I would recommend everything we tried, and would especially recommend sitting up where you can see all the magic happen in the kitchen.  Well done deseo, we'll be back fo sho."}

This place is no joke when it comes to impressing foodies.  The restaurant is inside the Westin Hotel which smells like a freakin spa as you enter.  My friend and I sat at the \"kitchen bar\" as I like to call it; an open kitchen where you can see the chef and cooks play.

We started with some cocktails and progressed to their ceviche menu.  We ordered the Millionaire Tacos, lobster, ahi tuna, hamachi, in a yuca taco shell, a light thin crunchy shell, but it worked.  The lobster and ahi had a fresh seafood bite while the jalapeno place atop gave it a pickle and spice crunch.  For our entree we shot for the Churrasco en Tabla; a cutting board of meats from what I see.  It was a skewer of beef tenderloin, jumbo shrimp, and pork tenderloin.  Well plated for sure since it came with a cooking stone to keep your choice of meats warm and 3 different sauces; roasted garlic, cipollini onion, and habanero.  My favorite was the habanero.  The 3 meats were welled cooked to temperature and juicy with every bite.  Placing them on the hot stone was just an extra flare of fun, but wasn't necessary.  

In the end, deseo is definitely a fun and romantic location.  It really wasn't too bad if you're thinking of a stay-cation for us PHX folks with relaxing spas and great eateries.  Service is definitely not lacking and on top while the view of the kitchen and golf course gave this place a relaxing vacation feel. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Had lamb chops for the entree, was a little too salty."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed!!  I travel a lot for work and hardly ever eat at the hotel. I decided to give it a try and wow, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. My thing is I like to try as many items as possible off the menu. Deseo offers wine flights- red or white. I tried the white, all South American wines and enjoyed each one, three different wines. The service was outstanding, starting with the host who was very friendly, my server was knowledgeable and took the time to explain several items on the menu and answer my questions. I sat at the rail and was asked if I was enjoying my dinner by no less than four other chefs in the kitchen- impressive. At my server's recommendation I ordered the lobster escabeche. It was wonderful, the lobster was cooked perfectly and served with a light, citrusy sauce typical of a ceviche, also with a fried avocado, which was a nice touch. I also tried the tartare which I order just about every place I go that has it on the menu. It was outstanding!! A lovely twist on tartare with a slightly spicy flavor, garlicky, and rolled in a yucca chip. I also tried the corn because I love street corn. It was not what I expected, but I was delighted!  The kernels were huge, unlike any corn I've ever had before, and served in a bright, zesty, citrusy, only slightly buttery sauce, almost like soup. Very different. I enjoyed every moment of my experience at Deseo, even though I was dining alone on a business trip. It was the perfect amount of food, just a bit much, but the small plates enabled me to try more than one entree with wasting a ton of food. I would definitely eat here again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great Latin restaurant tucked away at the Westin Kierland resort. Amazing food and great service. The servers are very committed to the concept and are enthusiastic about explaining the menu. Trust their recommendations."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Deseo for date night. Really nice decor, lovely Cuban painter at the entrance. It didn't felt like we were in Arizona.

I ordered a great Mojito, not made with that fake flavored rum and syrup.

The ceviche appetizer was incredible, as well as the empanadas and our entrees. We ordered the crab fried rice which  was good, with big chunks of crab, but salty. 

Our waitress, while nice, was in lala land. Absent minded, didn't seemed to know the menu and forgetful at times.

*Our visit was prior to them closing for vacation*"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food that's consistently great Deseo is amazing. First class staff and everything on the menu is awesome. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. Spectacular service. Manager checked on us.  Server was helpful on ordering. Every course was delicious. The Birthday dessert was awesome."}
{"text":"We just had an awesome meal at Deseo. All dishes were flavorful, well prepared, and presented with reserved flair. 

Thoroughly enjoyed the service and the ambiance. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food especially the vegetarian entree creation for my daughter by the chef.  A hidden gem in the hotel."}
{"text":"Before writing this I called Deseo 3 times today and one time i left a message for the manager, with no response.  i had dinner last night for Mother's Day because I told my son I wanted to try it. he made reservations for 6:30. We had dinner, which was OK, but about an hour after I got home, I got violently ill. We shared dishes but the only thing we didn't share was the halibut. I was so sick all night and couldn't go to work today because I was so weak. I will never go back and the I called the restaurant to let them know I got sick so no one else would get sick, but I never got a call back from the manager. I thought the least they could do was to credit my son the cost of my dinner. I am still weak and my stomach is still upset. I am so disappointed with their customer service. the millionaire tacos were not good, too much mayonnaise and all the rest of the food was just OK. And I know I got sick from the fish. When I say sick, I mean I got sick at least 12 times...awful. and no one from the restaurant cared enough to call me back."}
{"text":"With our party of 10, the service was impeccable. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing yet festive. Seating is comfortable.  If for no other reason I recommend deseo for its caipirinha, which is the best I've tasted since my last trip to Brazil some six years ago.  Every appetizer, every sauce and every dish on the table was unique, beautiful and delicious.  Nothing here is ordinary, it is quite extraordinary and satisfying.  I think I may have most enjoyed the Wagu beef empanada.  It's this kind of good!"}
{"text":"The aged rum flights was outstanding! LIVE MUSIC A PLUS!"}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant in Scottsdale worth the price. One of the few top tier restaurants in the area. An ideal place for a first date or anniversary. 

Food was aesthetically pleasing and delicious. 
Waiter was friendly, did not rush us, and took his time to explain the menu.
Portion sizes were filling.
Dessert was fantastic and definitely seemed home made.

I am a big fan of fresh meat and I was not disappointed here. It was spiced to perfection."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in scottsdale!! Be sure to order the rainbow, millionaire tacos, and shrimp chicharron."}
{"text":"*Please note, I am writing to review the Deseo Lounge only, not the adjoining restauraunt.

This is my favorite happy hour hideaway, and I'm reviewing it to pay it forward even though I am terrified that word will leak out to the local crowd about this fantastic resort secret.  Deseo is hidden in the basement of the Kierland Westin.  The cozy, dark and cool atmosphere with subtle candles and leather-padded walls makes me feel like I'm on a mysterious rendezvous every time I walk into the lounge.  

Their \"unwind hour\" is featured from 5:30-7:30 (please note that the bar doesn't open until 5:30) and features great prices on the best mojitos I have ever tasted (you can't go wrong with the classic Grande, but the berry-based version is pretty tasty as well).  Just a warning, the mojitos are STRONG and pack a punch for their very reasonable $5-$7 HH prices!  

Deseo is famous for their ceviche, and I highly recommend the Ecuadorian and Rainbow ceviches.  The other must-order items are the kobe meatballs (we all felt a little embarrassed at first over our love for the meatballs, but once you've had them, you'll order with pride) and the rolls, which are served hot and infused with trace amounts of some sort of cheese... I'm not sure what the magic ingredient is, but they just melt in your mouth.

The service is usually solid, with a very knowledgeable and experienced staff, but if they get a rush then expect to be patient while they make due with the hands they have.  The lounge is very small and intimate so it's not uncommon to grab a table just outside of the lounge walls if they are having a busy night."}
{"text":"So went last night we have a preferred dining card, buy one entree get one free.  We had been there several years before and thought it was ok.  Heard nothing but GREAT things ever since and we were so looking forward to going back.  We were seated on time place was nearly empty after 15 minutes I asked one of the several non-waiters standing nearby if we had a waiter. Our waiter appeared shortly and apologized \" he was busy working on things---I saw him speaking to probably the mgr.   So I ordered a Tito Martini straight up  with a rocks glass on the side.  Had the same drink at Morton's a few weeks ago for 8 dollars filled my rocks glass twice!!  This drink  barely filled my glass and was $17!!!  Said we would split the beet salad---most fine dining places split the salad before serving this was dripping in dressing and set on one plate for us to fend for ourselves.  And the famed cigar dessert---looks awesome taste definitely not worth the price neither are there famed potatoes.  I was in the past month at Le Bernadin in NYC and also ate in LA last weekend not bragging at all but soooo very disappointed in the service ( sorry waiter u were condescending ) and the price was outrageous for the  quality and service received!  There I said it!"}
{"text":"Especially since the rest of the hotel's food wasn't so spectacular, this place was quite a surprise. I was pleased with everything I got to try (and I tried a ton), good service, good selection. I wasn't a fan of having to sit in that weird hallway area next to the painter, but no big deal.

Duck empanadas - what a cool idea and delish! Ceviche was beautifully put together (as was everything, presentation was great here) and the biscuits were all a great start. I went with the churrasco steak....wowsa. I'm talking about a huge slab of meat where I was about to ask for a steak knife and then realized my butter knife could cut it. I savored every single bite. Couldn't pass up dessert and got a yummy and adorable dessert dish shaped like a cigar with a matchbook made of dessertness. Too cute, too good. 

Only bummer is the hours - doesn't open until later and so that's a little tricky but I would have been happy to eat here everynight I was here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 5 years or so, thanks to the Groupon,  unfortunately without discount or Groupon I don't think I will ever come back here , it's expensive, it's not like the portion is big , the service is great,  the complimentary cheese bread is the best ! But it's just too expensive,  the waiters that work there looks like they have been there for many years.  It looks like Westin takes really good care of there employees, it's sad to say but if they drop there prices maybe I'll come back"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat, we stumbled across this joint.  What a great surprise!

The restaurant is located on the sublevel floor of the hotel, below the lobby.  It's kind of hidden and difficult to find if you're unfamiliar with the place....but worth looking for.  The stairwell is lit with candles...I wonder how long it takes to light all of those every day?  Ha!

They serve you this Bread that must come from Heaven because it's so awesome!  The only bad part is that the Butter comes out cold and hard....why do restaurants do that?!  It's such a pain to spread it on the Bread.....it was awesome nevertheless.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w#2eQrsJcdON3yV2NWBPJq5w

For appetizers, we had the Kobe Beef Tenderloin Flatbread, $12.  It was very good and raw.....the server didn't tell us it was raw and neither did the menu (see pics below).  Good thing we didn't mind, but consider yourself warned.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/deseo-scottsdale?select=0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA#0o4t4YI1Gd10sO4wnhCerA

The Jidori Chicken is full of flavor and comes with some Pasta, so it's very filling.  The Squash & Cheese was good, but I thought was a little runny.  Very different flavors for your palette here.

The service was outstanding and the room is very elegant and romantic.  We washed it down with a bottle of Cabernet of course....yum!

I'm glad we found this place, can't wait to return.

{"text":"Loved the shrimp chicharrones! Chilean sea bass was to die for, perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. Our first visit, we will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not as it should be . Plates tried to be taken away with out asking.   Ticket was rung incorrectly.
When I asked for my dinner to be boxed to take with me, I asked for everything including thge broth. When i got home I was disappointed to find only the fish. 
Hostess offered to validate parking when we checked in.
Had a drink at the lobby bar while waiting for the other couple. Bartender keep touching her hair, too much simple syrup in the old fashioned,  maybe that was to make up for the small pour or knoweldge.
Nice meal with a living social deal. But wouldn't  return at regular pricing $400+. There are better places."}
{"text":"Our dinner at DESEO while visiting Scottsdale in November warrants between a 2 and 3 star out of 5.  Which means disappointment for a pricey place that is supposed to be among the best in town.  Started off poorly when our waiter came by for first time holding tray of trash and used glasses from another table.  Also, no matter that we asked twice for the rolls and garlic butter to brought before we ordered our food, they did not come until after, as it seems they are not released until food is ordered.  Food was generally fine, although wagyu hanger steak \"churrasco\" style\" was overwhelmed in oil.  Shrimp appetizer was good, and complimentary rolls and garlic butter were truly splendid.  The famed cigar dessert was a dud when we discovered the filling was crystallized from being re-frozen.  Restaurant just isn't worth $200+ a couple with 2 drinks per person."}
{"text":"We went for Restaurant Week and could not have been more pleased with our choice. (With the notable exception of pre-dinner drinks at at the Rim Lobby Lounge which were very overpriced, as well as water downed;  if you want pre-dinner drinks go anywhere but there.)

The table started with the rainbow ceviche and the mixto clasico;  both were divine, but the ceviche was my personal favorite for the entire meal.  Portions were generous as well.

The entire table ordered the grilled Kobe skirt steak and it was universally given rave reviews, as were the beautiful accent of potatoes.   (I was the only one who had leftovers.)

For dessert you must get the chocolate cigar/cappuccino gelato choice.   I was the only one at the table who went with the other choice, and I had major dessert envy.

Service was impeccable.   The wine list was solid.   The only area that could use a little improvement is that the ambience of the dining area seemed a bit dated and not as inspiring as I expected at a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"Monique, the bartender, makes an awesome muddled drink.  My favorite is the traditional mojito, but berry and mango mambo are very good.  She really knows how to balance the sweetness and tartness of the lime.  the dinner rolls are to die for, and the kobe beef appetizer is perfect with the truffel oil.  it is awesome!  the dinner is also spectacular but I like the appetizers the best.

honestly the price gets too high once you get to the entrees, else I would have said 5 stars.  also for 5 stars, the wine list needs to be a bit more refined.

i will definitely return though.  staff is FANTASTIC"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin Kierland Resort and had been traveling all day. I just wanted to stay close by so I looked at the various dining options at the resort. I came across their fine dining option deseo downstairs from the lobby. Knowing I'm more comfortable sitting at the bar, I spotted the small bar at the entrance and asked if they served dinner there. She responded that they did but she suggested I might like the other bar even more. She lead me around the corner and there it was.... a chef's table bar! Yea, exciting! 

I've been to other chef's bar restaurants and have enjoyed watching the kitchen activity but have not experienced much interaction with the staff. This was definitely different. From the minute I was seated, one of the sous chef's engaged me and we chatted (as he had time) the entire time. The chef came by and spoke with me some as well. I loved this. 

The first thing I spotted in the prep area was a bowl of popcorn. Intrigued I asked what it was used for. He commented that it was used as garnish on their ceviche special. OK, I'll admit, I don't think I've had ceviche very much in my entire life but man, the popcorn tipped the scales. I ordered the diver scallop - albacore tuna ceviche special (with the beloved popcorn) and it was the best. And by the way, chef tosses the popcorn with liquid nitrogen to crisp it up right before serving. I enjoyed the ceviche so much that I chose the diver scallop entree as well. Scallops served with crispy quinoa, carrot puree and fig puree. That was truly an excellent dish.

I enjoyed deseo so much that I decided to return two nights later. I had the metropolitan Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant list from which to choose but I chose to return to deseo. They were all glad to have me back."}
{"text":"I don't even remember how I stumbled upon Deseo. All I knew was it looked nice, the food looks exotic and tasty and I had to go there. It was my birthday treat with friends and family. Sure enough the menu is very exotic. Most of the Food was in Spanish and I had to ask our server what everything meant. The rules they bring first out of this world. I need little more salt of the dentist yet fluffiest bread I have ever tasted in my entire life. They were hot and begging to be put in my mouth. And when the butter melted on it, and made it that much more appetizing.
I had the fish and Bomba rice dish. The fish was absolutely amazing, and also the rice looks very enticing, it left a lot to be desired. It wasn't bad, no. I just expected more. I think what takes the cake was the birthday dessert. I've never seen anything like it. It was a chocolate cigar, gelato and the cute little thing of matches made out of icing! Everything melted in the mouth, and tasted exceptional! Even The Little Match book. I cannot wait to go you're again."}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal at Deseo. Everything from beginning to end was simply delicious and I highly recommend this restaurant for both folks staying at the Westin and folks just looking for a nice meal in Scottsdale.

Started by creating my own muddled cocktail - a pineapple, mango, and strawberry mojito. It was light and refreshing and only $6 during happy hour.

Once seated and after our orders were taken, the waiter brought us bread. This is the best bread I've ever had at a restaurant. In fact everyone at the table devoured a second piece within minutes. Apparently there is cheese in the middle of the roll but whatever they did, they did it right. 

For an app I had the chicken empanadas. The arugula mangala smash that accompanied them was unbelievable. The empanadas themselves were fried to perfection and the shredded chicken was seasoned well. 

I had the millionaire tacos for dinner. Wrapped in yuca chips, the lobster and tuna ceviche was fresh but there was a bit to much mayo on there for my liking. Neat concept though, and I did finish my plate. They are mini, but since I filled up on bread, I wasn't super hungry. 

The plantains and the spinach-quinoa sides were tasty. 

My co-workers enjoyed their meals too. The grouper, beet salad, and quesadilla received high praise.

Service was excellent and I look forward to returning soon."}

The kobe meatballs, lobster escabeche, all the empanadas, shrimp chicharron, kobe beef flatbread, caipirinha.  Those are my staples that I get EVERYTIME I go!  
I always sit in the bar with bartender Chris from MI, he is absolutely fabulous!!!  And, the drinks he makes always turn out phenomenal!  I insist he makes my drinks whilst there!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Everything were ordered from the apps to meals were delicious."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant gets high marks, but it is lacking in heart, and the food, while
interesting has no soul, no depth. The menu sounds very exotic, South American flavors...could be really something, but unfortunately, the tastes were disappointing.
It really is hotel food. We tasted the different ceviches, which were pretty to look at but in the taste department not really outstanding. The quesadilla, billed as South American was average. The mahi mahi was also just a C....One good dish was the
plantains, nice and sweet/sticky...but overall this place was not worth the price or the calories. I must admit, the hotel while a lovely resort, is just not the right place for good regional or ethnic food. But if you are staying in the hotel and don't want to venture too far, then Deseo is OK....but nothing more."}
{"text":"Deseo is such a beautiful restaurant! I loved the cheese bread, and could probably eaten an entire basket had they not rationed it and only given one roll per person. For the apps, we loved the beef tartare -- it wasn't too garlicky, and was fully of a really great mix of flavors. I didn't really understand the \"chorizo\" dust because it tasted like nothing, but the avocado dressing was tasty!
LOVED the wagyu short ribs, so tender and flavorful! The black bean stew was good, but I did NOT like the fried spinach. The leaves looked cool, but were oily and had a weird flavor. In terms of other entrees that I tried, the hangar steak was extremely juicy and tasty. And although the mole on top of the pork chop was delicious, the pork chop itself was very tough and thick. The corn tamale that comes with it is pretty dense as well, and it was hard to eat more than a bite. 
One of the highlights of our meal were the CHOCO CROQUETTES! They were golden nuggets of molten chocolate heaven! I definitely liked the croquettes more than the chocolate cigar. The cigar has a great aesthetic, but it was very thick and I wasn't blown away by the coffee ice cream either. 
I would definitely return for another fancy date night out or for a nicer family dinner! 

Side note: our waiter was weird when we mentioned that it was my parents' anniversary, and got moody/upset that we \"ruined the surprise of an anniversary dessert\". I was a little thrown off by that."}
{"text":"I love the place. I've been for dinner, but this last time was about drinks and appetizers. The ceviche is off the hook delicious. And the mojito's are spot on. Don't bother with the kobe beef meatballs - they are kind of forgettable except for the PRICE. If you like a caiparinha - you can get one here... my bartender was kind enough to tell me that she makes them sweet for the locals, and then made mine traditional upon request.  Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Similar to some other posts, I would say that Deseo is just okay-o.

Despite the breathtaking hotel and resort, the restaurant itself doesn't have much to offer. It's location is not ideal to that of high end restaurant- it's in a basement you would lookover as a bar. 

Food-wise, a group of us started the night with ceviches and the millionaire taco- HIGHLY recommended! If you come here and order one thing on the menu- a ceviche is thee way to go. The taco? Ingenious! Main courses were a disappointment given the prices. The salmon was moist and flavorful, but the cold side dish of a red lentil under a plantain was horrendous; I couldn't bare to take more than a bite or two- I've definitely had better salmon for under $26. Their chef special of sea bass was far from special; more ordinary at that. Kobe skirt steak was tender and very tasty, but again, the cold side dish of sliced onions was nay-ok! Dessert wise- the chocolate taco has received plentiful raves, but more cute to look at than delicious to eat at.

Call me a food snob, but I didn't think my meal and overall experience was worth $50 per person (tip included). The resort is gorgeous and I'd love to stop by for drinks (especially during sunset where the views of the golf course are spectacular), but I think Scottsdale's plethora of fine dining restaurants have more to offer than Deseo."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious appetizers and bread, and fabulous entrees.  Didn't have room for desert because every plate was cleaned."}
{"text":"Everything about Deseo is amazing!
It is pricey, but it is worth it.
I recommend the Rainbow Ceviche, fantastic!"}
{"text":"3 stars because of service. The waiter made me feel rushed by asking too often whether I was ready to order and simply brought the check at the end without offering the dessert menu! There is also only one bathroom (with two stalls), which is strange for such a large restaurant. I waited for a stall to open for 5 minutes then gave up (probably wouldn't want to walk in there after those people were taking so long anyway). 
Besides the service, the restaurant was wonderful. Good food, and simple but warm decor. 
I would like to see them train their waiters more before I would recommend this place; there are so many impossibly amazing restaurants in Scottsdale: SKIP IT!"}
{"text":"If you are considering a nice dinner out, Deseo is a great selection.  We were invited here to complete a dinner party for four.  It is noteworthy, the main reason for the visit was to take advantage of a Groupon deal.

For appetizers, we tried the Nikkie, Ensalada de Perluche, and the Red Quinoa Soup.  The soup was by far the best flavor.  HINT: Add all of the spicy stuff they have on the side.  The fresh tuna was great.  And the salad, well... its a salad.

For the main dish, 3 of us chose the Wagyu Hanger Steak \"Churrasco\" style.  All were ordered medium rare.  The 4th in our group went with the Yuca Wrapped Dorado al Ajillo.  The Mahi Mahi looked good when it arrived, but we all chowed down on the beef.  It was so flavorful and tender.

For dessert, we had 3 Chocolate Cigars and an Arroz con Leche \"Abuelita\".  The cigars were VERY rich, but fabulous.  The rice pudding was good, but nothing compared to the cigars.

The only thing holding back the 5th star is the drinks.  3 mojitos and 2 old fashioned drinks was $100.  Very high prices for drinks.  I expect higher prices on chef prepared foods.  But all the cocktails were house level, not top shelf selections.  So it would be nice to see those prices a lil better.

May go back again... but only if the Groupon deal is still available."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high.  The food is good.  The drinks are unique.  The ambiance is pleasant.  The service is friendly and accommodating.  So why only three stars?  Because when I may be shelling out more than $100 dollars for dinner for two at a resort restaurant with a James Beard winning chef at the helm, I want to be blown away.

I like the set up.  The entrance is a short walk from the front of the Westin.  You enter through a side door, then go down a candle lit staircase to the hostess stand.  The hostess is as pleasant as can be, and there is an artist working on some pieces, which was interesting to watch for the minute or two we waited for someone to take us to our table.  I also am fascinated by the bar set up around the open kitchen.  I always find it interesting to watch they way high class restaurants prepare food (unless you end you seeing something nasty).  Deseo's set up is very sleek and modern.

We started with a round of Mojitos.  I had berry, my girlfriend had nectar.  The berry was okay after I made the effort to crush up the fresh fruit and mint with my straw.  I hate to sound lazy, but you'd think that's something the bartender would've done.  The nectar was much better.  For our meals we had the beef tenderloin and lamb.  The beef tenderloin was said to be churrasco style.  That usually means flat and charred with a chimichurri sauce.  This steak was big and fat, and the sauce was barely there.  It was a good Beef tenderloin and cooked perfectly to medium, but it wasn't anything amazing.  There also was a sauce on the plate that was very powerfully vinegary, which was a little odd.  The lamb itself was excellent, but it also had a very oily sauce on the plate that I didn't care for.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cigar.  This was cool just in presentation, alone.  A thin small cake, rolled like a cigar, with a white chocolate and hazelnut filling.  It also had a coffee gelato served along side.  I also want to mention the awesome rolls.  The bread was made from some sort of white corn and served with a garlic butter.  If more were brought to the table I would've eaten all of them.  Although I found it odd that the rolls came just seconds before our meal.  I guess the bread guy was on break.

The food was good.  But as I've said, none of it had that wow factor I was hoping for.  The bill for this meal came to $115.  Not crazy expensive, but just high enough to leave me desiring more from the kitchen staff.  I used a $60 for $30 gift certificate from localdines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) which knocked a good portion of that cost off of the check.  overall, Deseo is wonderful place to dine.  Everything is fresh and well prepared, but I have been to many better places in the valley that are a lot easier on the wallet.  Worth an experience, but I don't know if its worth another visit in the immediate future."}
{"text":"We were NOT impressed for the price of dinner. Food was adequate but nothing special. Service was excellent ...ambiance lovely. Would we go there again..NO"}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale and staying at the Kierland Westin resort. Thinking that is was a hotel restaurant, we didn't expect much out of it...but it blew us away! Service was wonderful and every dish from the warm spanish bread served to the appetizer to the main dishes AND the desserts were immaculately done. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and left fulfilled.

(Sorry can't give a play by play on each dish cuz I forgot all the names...)

don't miss it if you're ever at the Westin Kierland!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday a few days ago.  Asked for a nice table, they sat us at a perfect location by the window with a fantastic view if the golf course.  Food was wonderful, especially the ceviche.  Would have given them 5 stars, but the service was mediocre at best.  Maybe the waiter was having a bad day, or maybe he just was a lousy waiter."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Deseo. The food was outstanding and the mojitos, which I am usually not a fan of, are amazing and compliment the food so well. I have only been once but hopefully I will get to experience Deseo again. Four stars only because our waiter forgot our sides with our entrees and the decorum is a little ho-hum."}
{"text":"What a great place! The bartender Nick makes some really great drinks! Its hard to say the best one so try them all!  They are all really good!"}
{"text":"Favorite thing on the menu is Shrimp Chicharron. I could eat three plates of this! Sitting on the rail and watching them cook and interacting with the chefs is incredible. 

Be sure to get there early and enjoy the mojitos at happy hour."}
{"text":"disappointing... bought the most expensive meal on the menu which is ceviche but not worth my $35... I'm not going there again... to be fair, I'll give them credit for the delicious yuca roll and the ambience"}
{"text":"Always I visit this restaurant with my friends and we are always very happy here! It has a wonderful food, friendly staff and excellent menu! The prices are reasonable. I recommend you all to visit this restaurant and I am sure you will not be disappointed with it! I think this place deserve five stars. Thank you very much for a great service!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here based on the other yelp reviews. It was wonderful! Lived up to and exceeded my expectations. Had the millionaire tacos, beet salad and we both had the yucca crusted fish dinner. Everything was fabulous. Service was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant. Actually I hope to come here again tomorrow for dinner!
."}
{"text":"Deseo came as advertised! The food was incredible, the service was prompt and the wine was a great pair! I would highly recommend this for a special occasion dinner or if just in the mood for some nice dining and mouthwatering food."}
{"text":"Nuevo Latino cuisine at its finest. When you combine elegant presentation, Latin infused flavors, and excellent service, you can't go wrong.

We went on a Monday night, and redeemed 1000 points through OpenTable reservations. Since it was a weekday night, it naturally wasn't too busy, with only a few patrons here for dinner.

We had a Groupon, and redeemed a 3 course meal. Despite this being an evanescent deal, the restaurant had the choices for the 3 course menu printed out and posted on a one-page, hard-backed menu like it was a regular menu- very nice touch! 

We started with the millionaire tacos and ceviche. The millionaire tacos were superb, filled with fresh seafood, with a variety of textures and flavors running through the appetizer. I especially enjoyed the use of yuca chips as the shell for the tortilla. The ceviche was good as well, with spicy piquant flavors and a masterfully done presentation, but the added textural component of the millionaire tacos made me a bigger fan of this dish.

For entrees, we had the kobe vaca encebollada (Skirt steak), and yuca-­wrapped  dorado al ajillo (Mahi-mahi and shrimp with garlic sauce). The kobe beef was very tender, and a complex mix of flavors. The blue potatoes that went with it were stunning, both in flavor and in presentation. The seafood dish was excellent as well, from the crispy crusted mahi-mahi to the tender shrimp swimming in a saffron colored citrus-garlic sauce. I particularly enjoyed the use of toasted amaranth to add an extra textural crunch and nutty taste. 

To further gild the lily, we ended our meal with dessert, sharing the crema
 catalana and the chocolate cigar. The crema catalana was an interesting blend of flan and crème brulée (It is in fact the Catalan version of crème brulée). The creaminess of the custard meshed well with the berries and whipped cream, and there was a light topping of candied peeled ginger on top. The chocolate cigar was pure indulgence, and I loved the unique presentation. The cigar was wrapped with a \"Deseo\" paper ring, and they even made candy matches and a coffee mousse dessert to go with it.

Unlike other restaurants where Groupon patrons are treated like they are the scum of the earth, service was impeccable and we were treated just like regular paying customers.

If you have the coin to spend on a good meal, or if you are feeling like splurging and going to somewhere nice, this is definitely a good place to go! The grounds at the Westin are beautiful as well, and if you park in the regular parking lot you get to see a little bit of them as you walk to Deseo.

Overall, a wonderful meal at an excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"Phoenix was the last stop on our road trip so we decided it warranted a fancy night out! Deseo is a great spot located at the Westin resort in Scottsdale. My guy and I sat at the chefs counter and loved watching as they prepared the dishes. It's such a treat to see the care they take in putting together the beautiful plates of ceviche. Since we were really going for it on our last night of trip we ordered the millionaire tacos and surf y césped, which is pretty much all of the best things ever in one bite. Next up was the squash soup with apple relish and duck confit, sooooo yummy and they pour the soup over the other components table side. Always fun to watch. For our entrees I ordered the short rib and my fella got the hanger steak. The steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri sauce was a killer compliment to the meat. The short rib was arguably the best I've ever had! The texture was amazing, unlike any I've had previously. It was firm without being tough, like eating a great steak, yet soft and melt in your mouth like you want in a good short rib. The Chef explained it was because of the method they use to cook it. Whatever they did to it made it freaking delicious and I only want them cooked that way from now on! The service here was wonderful and attentive. It was really cool interacting and asking question about the food to the folks in the kitchen. Definitely coming back to this place the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Chef Roberto Madrid has been at Deseo since it opened and he is the Latin King of great food. sat at the table overlooking the busy kitchen because 1: i was solo 2: the sous chef may take pity on me and throw me a free sample of the Millionaire Taco (he did and it was AMAZING!) 3: a friend told me to sit in Jinny's section. Please ask for her-she is truly talented and sweet person. 

So...shrimp chicarron anyone? Fiery sauce, plump shrimp and pickled jalepenos (of course I asked for more, which killed me the next day).  Chef Roberto introduced himself to me, probably in an effort to slow my eating process down to a respectable tempo...he was so gracious. Then I was back inhaling the warm yeast rolls served with real (thank you ) butter and plenty of it.

Real cocktails here, worthy of the name Deseo (meaning Desire) and I desire a great drink. Check out the bar area first and you can understand why your mojito or specialty cocktail costs $11-14. Real fresh fruit and herbs and high end liquor as their staple. Most bars serve juice from a can and still expect you to pay top dollar. I told Jinny I wanted a drink \"made of rums, fresh juices and fruit\" ...go wild. The bartender created some drink I'm going to call \"Skipping Home\" because I literally skipped upstairs to my room afterward! 

I always eat here at least two times when I stay at The Westin Kierland. Check to make sure they are open since it isn't open 7 nights a week. Definitely worth a trip, even if you aren't staying there...but you should...so much to do on property."}
{"text":"Could not have been happier with the experience. Food was unique and dynamic. That was only part of the great evening. I was so impressed with the server, Lou. He was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Finally, setting the fine example was Dave, the General Manager. 
We very much appreciated the great service, wonderful food and the awesome evening."}
{"text":"Excellent food but set in an overly formal and dark setting. We had rack of lamb (huge but perfectly cooked), hangar steak (excellent), and carnitas (very good). Standouts were a side order of plantains and a hamachi ceviche. Service was good but not amazing - we must have been asked three times if we were having dessert - and the waiter wasn't overly adept at staging the meal or helping us make the best choices. Overall, a very good meal but it would be so much more enjoyable in a looser more contemporary dining room with a fun vibe to match the menu."}
{"text":"It was Date Night and we were looking for a culinary experience, We did have to make special advance reservations but we opted for a Chef's Selection Five-Course Tasting Meal.

As we enter we are immediately welcomed graciously by the friendly host, our table isn't ready yet so we get a chance to observe the resident artist create a beautiful and colorful piece in the restaurant lobby. He takes a moment to chat with me about his work and the restaurant is adorned with it work throughout.

Once we are seated we decide on some of the Muddled Cocktails trying the Very Berry and the Mambo Mango. Both tasted very \"fresh\" it was obvious the fruit used were at their peak and the flavors were balanced expertly. 

For our first course we tried the Billionaire Tacos (we may not be, but we can dream) and the Rainbow Ceviche. These were out-of-character selections as I am not a \"seafood\" person, but I was happily surprised. The \"fishy\" flavor I dislike was nowhere to be found in either of these dishes. Both were a perfect melody of flavors, our favorite enhancement being the red jalapeno that really woke your taste buds (and sinuses) up. Also, incredibly noteable was the yuca wrapped mahi-mahi. It literally melted in your mouth. It was savory, buttery, crisp and tender. 

The service was excellent and the food memorable. You can bet we will be visiting Deseo again."}
{"text":"Sat at the rail, and was able to watch chefs prepare extraordinary works of art! Chef Eden was very professional and explained the dishes perfectly. Have to get the cigar for dessert!"}
{"text":"They must have had an off night if I am to believe all of the high marks here.  The service was not very good.  I had to ask for pepper 4 times before I got it, I nearly was eating dessert before it arrived.

The fish (John Dory) was very bland and the preparation too salty. (Hence my asking for the pepper).  There was no other taste to it.  The lobster ceviche was good, but the portion was so tiny for $21, not worth it.  The fries were excellent, but then many places make good fries.

So, another expensive pretty restaurant, overpriced and under flavored food.  Typical Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Deseo with my husband. First stop was the lounge because the Westin gave us $25 there for being SPG platinum. Tip: you can order any appetizer from the lounge, not just what they show on the limited menu. Having now tried both the Millionaire Tacos and the Mixto Classico I am confident you cannot go wrong with their ceviche dishes. Compared to SF or NY, I would say quality is just as good and you get a little more food for your buck.  On to dinner. We sat at the counter of their exhibition kitchen and I would HIGHLY recommend this. It was fascinating and simply a lot of fun.  The Kobe beef flatbread is small but amazing. I think the beef is cured because it has a depth of flavor that is just incredible. We also split the duck entree, which was OK but in comparison to everything else it was very good but not spectacular. Deseo has a reasonably priced wine list with a focus on south American wines, including wines from Patagonia. I highly recommend a glass of the Manos Negras. Also, their bread is this dense roll- I can't remember the name of it. We'd had something similar in Colombia. Anyways, they are great especially with the butter. 

Service was excellent. Friendly and unpretentious, polite, attentive, with firm recommendations from the menu. 

We would love to come back here again and again.  And we would if there wasn't the allure of other restaurants to try.  The Mission in old town Scottsdale was also very good (food not quite as good but fantastic ambiance outdoors and very good food). Tonight will try Distrito."}
{"text":"For our second anniversary dinner, I was looking for a new place for a special dinner.  I came across a Groupon for Deseo for their 3 course Prix Fixe menu.  Using a Groupon at a fancy place always feels a bit awkward because you're suppose to announce the discount you are using to the hostess as well as the server.  But I didn't feel as if they treated me any different from a normal paying patron, and service was fantastic.
The setting at the Westin is very nice, although we did go during Spring Break...which means a lot of families on vacation.  The golfing greens were littered with children running around.  The romantic fire pits outside (which would've been perfect for an after-dinner drink) were full of kids after the sun went down.  I don't understand why the bar/lounge area can't have a no-kids area...perhaps because Scottsdale people would complain too much.  This would be more on the Westin staff than the Deseo staff.
Anyways, on to the food.  We were definitely happy with the portion/price ratio for appetizers, entrees and desserts alike.  My negative review on Roy's restaurant includes my rant of the opposite.
Not only were the portions great, the food was the star of the show.  Sauces, meats, fish...all very fresh and succulent.  I've already told another couple about the Groupon deal, and to buy it up ASAP, because for half off, it is a fantastic deal for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"On Friday, December 10th, PhoenixBites.com had the honor of co-hosting an event with The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa.  Our media guests were treated to a muddling class, ceviche instruction and tasting as well as a delightful dinner and dessert.

deseo is located on the lobby level of the resort offering an enticing menu created by James Beard award winning Chef Douglas Rodriguez, regarded as the inventor of Nuevo Latino Cuisine.

Upon arrival, we were escorted to the Muddle Bar.  The room is warm and dark, offering up a relaxing atmosphere largely due to the rich, warm wood.

We were presented with the Grande Mojito.

Our instructor and mixologist, Monique Dias, was so enthusiastic and full of information regarding all facets of muddling.  It was not only an enjoyable experience, but an interesting history lesson of sorts.  Tasty too!

We were able to sample the Grande as well as the Berry Grande Mojitos.  While both were delicious and I rather enjoyed the introduction of fruit, I am partial to the original version.

After our Muddling Course was complete we were lead to \"the rail\".  The Rail overlooks the open kitchen.  I have to say, if given a choice of dining at a table in the main room or at The Rail, I would always choose the rail.  I couldn't imagine all the things you would be able to see on a busy night, not to mention the tips one could pick up just by being in the presence of these amazing chefs!  Chef Rodriguez treated us to an in-depth lesson in all things ceviche.  I was amazed at the amount of information that he knew and shared with us.  (I won't spill it all, since I really want you to check out deseo and The Rail and have your experience not be tainted by mine!)

Our first indulgence was the Rainbow Ceviche, a beautifully presented dish featuring tuna, salmon and hamachi dressed with white soy, citrus, sesame seeds and pickled jalapeno.  In short - it was amazing and my hands-down favorite of the three ceviches of the night.  It was so fresh and light and the slight punch of the pickled jalapenos was unexpected yet welcomed.

Next up we had the Lobster Escabeche which was a delicate ceviche served with avocado, chives, sweet aji and garlic chips.  This is not what you think of when you hear \"ceviche\".  It was delicate yet rich.  Beautifully presented and a treat to my mouth!

We completed the trio with the Ceviche Mixto Clasico, full of lobster, shrimp, scallops, calamari, octopus, crab, red onion and an accompaniment of sweet potato.  What a decadent way to round out the tasting.

Prior to being served our entrees, Chef Rodriguez spread some holiday cheer by treating all of our guests to a personalized autographed copy of his most recent book, The Great Ceviche Book, revised. This book will provide you a bounty of information and instruction as well as hints and tips to create an array of ceviches!  This was such a wonderful treat to our guests and we were blown away by his generosity.

After we calmed down from the excitement, is was time for our entrees.  We were served a split plate of tender beef tenderloin and merluza sea bass and fideo.  The contrast of flavors and textures of these two dishes was complex and only lent to the entire experience of the evening.

Overall - this event, having been our first to co-host - will be close to impossible to beat.  The staff was incredible.  Everyone was so helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere was lively, but not in a crazy Scottsdale Saturday night kind of way.  The food was impeccable and all the attention to detail and care in explanation made it a night worth repeating!"}
{"text":"We had a very lovely dinner at Deseo the other night. I bought the groupon for four and took another couple with us. Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was fantastic. The only thing that kept me form giving Deseo five stars was that I found the yellowtail to be a bit too sweet and I didn't like the seasoning on my friend's mahi mahi. It was also a little dry, but mahi mahi is so hard to cook. However, three of us ordered the hangar steak, and it was fantastic. Two of us ordered the tuna with avocado mousse, and that was also amazing. If I went back, I would definitely stick with those two dishes. Actually, WHEN I go back :)"}
{"text":"Deseo is a beautiful restaurant that has an elegant menu and decor, and a price point that encourages fine dining.   We showed up at our 7pm res ready to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and dressed for a romantic evening in what he had heard is a lovely setting.  The food and service were very good, but that's not my strongest recollection.  More than half the guests were dressed very casually, some in gym shorts and flip flops.  They did not add to the attractiveness of the place when they walked by.  The table directly in front of us had three unruly children that stressed us out.  It all made for an unromantic setting.  I would recommend Deseo for casual dining if you are already on the property, but there are many other places in the area that do fine dining better."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that it is wholly based on the service I received.  Were I reviewing the food, it would have been a solid 4 stars.

My husband and I visited deseo for dinner a few weeks ago.  We had been to deseo before and were both pleased with the experience.  We returned, having been gifted a groupon at Christmastime that was set to expire in the coming days.  It being a cool Monday evening in March, I was feeling a bit chilly and was looking to warm up quickly.  My customary way of doing so is to order a cup of hot water with lemon.  After we had been seated, our server came to ask us for our drink orders.  I requested the hot cup of water.  To this I was greeted with \"A cup of hot water?? **AUDIBLE SCOFF** Ookay...\"  I was completely dumbfounded by the rude manner in which my order was received.  Never in the many years I have asked for a cup of hot water at restaurants both upscale and casual have I been made to feel like it was either unusual or shameful.  As upsetting as this initial interaction was, however, I resolved to let it go so as to not ruin our meal.  The server returned to take our dinner order, after which my husband left the table to go to the restroom.  While he was gone, the server returned with our dinner rolls, which he placed individually on each of our bread plates.  He first served my roll, and as he was reaching down to place my husband's on his plate, the server stated, \"Don't eat his bread while he's away from the table, please.\"  Now initially I believed this to be a joke, but when I looked up at the server's face, there was no trace of humor or sarcasm.  The stern manner in which he said \"please\" left me to believe that it was in total seriousness.  I was completely nonplussed.  My husband returned to the table, and I relayed what had just happened.  He suggested too that it might have been a joke, but throughout our meal we search for the slightest bit of humor or joviality and found none.  Our last interaction with the server consisted of him greeting us good evening after we had paid the bill, his lips moving while his eyes wandered above our heads to whatever was behind us, demonstrating just how completely disengaged he was with our table.

Never have I been so offended by a server.  I'm not clear if there was a reason for this treatment -- was it the groupon?  was it that my husband and I were younger than the other guests dining that evening? was it another reason? -- I'm still left confused and insulted.  To be clear through, I observed other servers at adjacent tables, and those others appeared to be cordial and friendly.  The table runners especially were very kind, smiling and politely conversing as they cleared plates through each course.  It was in fact the friendliness of table runners that resulted in this being a 2-star rating as opposed to 1.  I hope for this restaruant's sake this this was an isolated event because no guest deserves to be made to feel so low."}
{"text":"deseo is an exciting restaurant due to the experience of the food that we had at this Award winning Nuevo Latino cuisine. We enjoyed their tostada, duck and prime rib empanadas, and chicken dishes.  It was also great to see how quickly the five line chefs orchestrated by the head chef got the dishes out quickly,  hot (temperature) and flavorful.  Each dish that we experienced had a touch of Asian flavor,  they were so flavorful that we were able to taste most of the flavors which blended well together. 

Also we got a chance to meet the artist who created a lot of the beautiful artwork that was strategically placed within the foyer, stairway and throughout the restaurant. We watched him worked as he began to create another piece of art.  He was so personable as he explained to us him creative process in his native tongue which after a while we had to have it translated ; -)

If you are ever in Scottsdale, Arizona and want to try something new and exciting in a beautiful place with excellent customer service stop by deseo."}
{"text":"My wife would give Deseo 5 stars. I would give them 2 stars.  Since I'm writing the review, I'm opting for a compromise of 3 to keep peace in the family.  First, the cocktails (at $13 each) were tasty but lacked any real semblance of having alcohol in them - perhaps the weakest drinks I have ever had in town.  My wife's beef empanada appetizer, according to her, was wonderful, as was her pork chop entrée.  Our waiter, Philman (who was excellent, by the way) told me that the Ceviches were their specialties.  So I ordered one.  Many of them appeared somewhat odd on the menu, at least to my tastes, so I opted for the Clasico.  It was very fruity, lacking the acidity that, to me, makes for a good Ceviche.  My entrée was the Churrasco, cooked medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly, and was seasoned adequately.  The particular piece of meat I was served was tough.  In fact, I had to literally saw through it, and if chewing each bite dozens of times is good eating etiquette, then it must have been excellent.  Not.  It was difficult to chew, and I could only finish half of it.  My wife loved the ambiance.  Me, not so much.  The décor was very nice, but the room felt more like a decorated banquet room than it did a fine dining restaurant.  I'm sure she would be happy to return.  I will not."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week for the 3 course for $30 per person. Every aspect of the experience was fabulous. The only thing that wasn't overwhelmingly positive was the fact that they didn't ask us if we wanted coffee before dessert. Other than that we thought that live music would have taken the evening to the next level. 

Water was on the table almost as soon as we sat down. I started off with a glass of pinot and she had the mojito. The wine was nice and the nectar grande mojito was delicious, well balanced and had quite the kick. The sugar cane stick was a fun touch. 

The meal started with little buns with creamy garlicky butter. They were delicious. Perfect light outside and spongy elastic-like inside that soaked up the butter. Almost cloud-like. 

The appetizers came out right after the buns.

I had the shrimp ceviche and she had the goat cheese empinada. The ceviche was fresh and delicious. Great mixture of textures with the shrimp, pieces of tomato and other parts of the sauce with tiny greens, I think it was tiny bits of cilantro. The avocado that came with it was perfect and made a great contrast to the shrimp. It had a complex mixture of flavors. 

The empinada was amazing. The goat cheese was rich and balanced well with the light and crispy texture of the empinada with beet chimichurri. 

We both had the salmon with red lentils. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was moist with a crispy top. The sauce was a tiny bit too sweet for one of us but was very tasty. The little bits of tomatoes were a great addition as well. 

I had the chocolate cigar with cappuccino gelato. Both were rich and delicious. The cigar kept improving as it warmed down to room temperature (it was tiny bit cold when it came out). 

She had the rice pudding with dulce de leche and Cuban cookie. It was very good and lighter than the chocolate cigar dessert. 

The service was great and our waitress answered all of the questions we had about the menu. Overall this was probably the best meal we've had in Arizona so far. We'll definitely go back for a special occassion"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my two meals here over 3 days. We sat at the rail both times and had a good convo with the Chefs. I loved the millionaire tacos, and the flat bread. I also couldn't get enough of their ceviches, all were super good. 

The muddle bar looked like fun, unfortunately we missed it both times. Next time it is on my list as a must do! I'll be back here in the future."}
{"text":"This is a modern interpretation of a Brazilian steak house, and it succeeds in most respects, especially the competent food.  However, there are rough edges.  The drinks are expensive and hardly generous.  The service, even when the restaurant was less than half full, was a little too slow.  And one of our party had the bad luck to order a steak medium rare and get it very well done indeed.  When he sent it back, it took them over 20 minutes to bring him another -- entirely too long for such a dish.  The waiter's response was \"it's not my fault.\"  However, it was comped and we all got free dessert, which is at least part of a proper response.  Probably worth going to, if you have a 2 for 1 coupon."}
{"text":"We went here on the pre fixe 3 course groupon and it was a great deal and there were plenty of options.  Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well so went with a more bland option compared to what I would ordinarily do:    Chicken as entree and quesadilla as start.   Both were tasty.   The chicken came with these papas-type item that was a cross between a chip and a French fry-- delicious!    Hubbie got ceviche to start and steak as entree and both were fresh and delicious.   Generous portions too.    Our server was polite too even tho we were there on groupon and came up with interesting banter during his visits.   Bottom line: recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent! Everything they have is excellent! Luckily when I went I was with a large group so I was able to try many different items. It is hard to say anything that stood out because each dish was so unique in it's own way. It is an expensive restaurant, but you know that going in and it is well worth it. Not only is their food great, but they have the best mojitos I have had anywhere I have been in the state. 

Deseo has a very nice decor, the service is excellent and the staff is very helpful with explaining their menu."}
{"text":"I booked a table for two for my husband's birthday through open table.  Under the comment/suggestion box I told them it was his birthday and asked for a special birthday dessert, which they so generously provided.  For starters we had an ahi appetizer with avocado. Highly recommend.  For dinner we did the filet and skirt steak, along with a side of the rice and crab dish.  Everything tasted fantastic and had it's own individual flavor that complimented the other food items.  As stated early, for dessert (gratis) they gave my husband a chocolate cigar, white chocolate bar, and cappuccino gelato.  It was all amazing and great way to end the meal.  Thanks to our waiter Samantha!"}
{"text":"I've eaten her at least ten times, and enjoyed drinks and Tapas just recently.

Located inside the Westin Hotel, the restaurant probably serves mostly out of towners, which is a shame, because the food is so diverse and yummy.  And no mariachis!

\"Latin-influenced cuisine,\" is Deseo's mantra.  I recommend the beef tenderloin churrasco style.  It's not like Brazilian Churrascaria, more an Argentinian version of tenderloin.  Enough to share.

No wet burritos, nor all you can eat chips and salsa.  Not a place to order a margarita.

Outside patio eating is awesome in the spring and summer, and some fellow wales on bag pipes at sun down.  You can see the sun setting while overlooking green fair ways, and see the Mc Dowel Mountains.

Very large open kitchen eating area for the winter months, or eat in the small bar.  Ceviche and Mojitos are Deseo's signature items, although pretty much anything on the menu is yummy.

It's the only place I've been able to have a proper Caipirinha.  Dress is \"hotel casual\" whatever that means. PLEASE leave your Tommy Bahama shirt and khaki shorts at home.  Or burn them.

Parking is complementary Valet until 11:00 pm, which is awesome.  You can also take a shuttle over to Kierland commons.

A very unique variety south american food, and a nice place to take your mistress (but the rooms are pricy, so I've heard)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and I honestly had a top 5 dish of my life...more on that later...nested in the Westin kierland...very trendy atmosphere...nice upbeat music with perfect volume so you can still talk! Started with millionaire tacos...seafood/fish shredded filling with tuna on top. Then had scallop ceviche which was spicy and yummy. Next was strawberry gazpacho which had excellent presentation and really tasty!! Then one of the top 5 dishes of my life...the surf and turf appetizer...the wayugu beef with the uni and caviar was simply ridiculously perfect!! It was seriously that good!! The wayugu empanada was to die for as well, perfect flavor and tenderness...second best dish of the night!! The beef tartar was good but underwhelming simply because of the other two beef dishes...then ended the night with chocolate cigar desert!! What a meal!! Perfect!!"}
{"text":"We just got back from a 6 night stay at the lovely Westin Kierland Resort. The staff seemed quite enthusiastic about their restaurant Deseo and I would normally take that to mean it was an overhyped part of working there. But no-just like previous reviewers it is truly a fabulous place to dine. I won't bore the reader with tedious details-other reviews will suffice for that. My take is, after 35 years of business travel and staying at literally hundreds of hotels, this is the first hotel restaurant I have ever eaten at a second time. Do not miss it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have always been impressed with the food quality.  Not cheap so I'll give 4 stars instead of 5.  Still, it's worth the time to check them out and taste their unique menu."}
{"text":"If i had a chance to try this place without getting kicked out i might like it.  All i was looking for was a quite place to grab a drink, however the bartender rudely told us she cant serve us drinks till 530......they failed to realize the doors where open the candles were lit and no one stopped us from going all the way down the stairs to only be turn around and sent away.  It was 5pm and there were what i believe two other ladies at the bar drinking i think.  i should have pay more of a attention.  I guessing since i wasnt a VIP i could stay."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute favorite of mine.  Amazing Latin fusion. Superb service each time I have gone.  Food is amazing from the cheese bread to the incredible deserts.  Order the cigar for desert if you want to empress."}
{"text":"I love this menu, and style of cooking - the decor is bad, though. They need a design makeover, save the open kitchen.   That being said, I had a delicious meal: chicken empanadas, cuban enchilado shrimp, and a light, buttery Torrontes.  The Latin flavors were authentic and very well thought out, and my dishes were all neatly executed.  Friendly and attentive waitstaff.  I think this place would do SO much better were it not in a B list resort."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner.  My wife and I were staying at the resort on vacation and knew we wanted a special meal... this did not dissapoint!  As many yelper's talk about, the Millionaire Tacos are fantanstic.. the 5 little mini tacos were just enough for a light start to a heavier meal... and do not get me started on the bread (rolls) as  could have just had bread and butter and walked away happy.  Drinks were yummy (both had mojitos) and main courses were perfect (Beef Tenderloin for me, Halibut for my wife).. we were also blown away by the side dish of smoked paprika garbanzo beans (with spanish chorizo)... it was an outstanding compliment to dinner. We opted for the Warm Chocolate Croquettes which were so good I wanted more even though I was full.  This is an OUTSTANDING restaurant!"}
{"text":"I know the chef de cuisine was awarded the James beard award but I thought the food was just okay. Perhaps I'm a good snob given the volume of fantastic restaurants in NYC but for the price and all the hyped reviews, I thought the food was underwhelming. 

Starter: tres ceviches
-consisted of three different types of seafood ceviches that took longer to compose than it did for me to consume. It was worth the wait as anything doused with lime juice is a win for me. My favorite of the trio was the lobster escabeche with avocado tempura. Flavor notes were reminiscent of nachos lol. The tuna third of the app was great, served with a coconut milk sauce. There was a weird popcorn garnish that I thought was completely unnecessary.  

Main: I had the special of the night which was zucchini wrapped scallops with skirt steak
-scallops weren't seared as well as they could've been. No real crust and wrapping then in zucchini only made them mushy. However I have to respect the quality of the actual ingredient and they were a pair of meaty and juicy scallops!  The steak it was served with was smothered in this weird, cloyingly sweet sauce that was completely off putting. It was served over a bed of sautéed mushrooms that was also drenched in this sugary gloop. I was really sad that I wasn't able to clean my plate as I generally try to do everywhere I eat (think of the starving children in the world) but the sauce ruined things for me. I did my best to wipe it off the meat but even then I was chewing and swallowing with my breath held and mentally clenched teeth. 

Overall: service was great and liked my app but the entree depressed me. Maybe the standard menu options would've been better but if you're looking to try something new, avoid the special!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. I went once with a friend's family and a second time with my own. After the first time I craved it until I went back almost a year later. 

I would say this is a hidden gem that possibly hotel guests get to enjoy more than the locals due to it being located in a hotel in North Scottsdale. Regardless, this place is incredible. They have a great wine selection as well as good mojitos. 

However, the best thing on the menu has to be the Lobster Taco's. They are incredible. It comes in a tray with 4-5 I believe. They are little baby tacos served with the kinda spicy kinda bitter sauce that melt in your mouth. I'm not kidding - they are so great. We ordered multiple orders because they are so good that you need to just keep eating them. The first time I went I got some sort of Seafood dish that had squid, mussels, lobster, clams, and the like - but the second time I went they no longer had it on the menu. So, I ordered a beef dish. It was great but not as excellent as the previous. I would go there for the Lobster Taco's any day of the week, multiple times a day."}
{"text":"This gem is hidden away inside the Westin Kierland Resort.  Had it not been for a recommendation from an associate, I would never have gone here.

Ambiance - The location, decor and weather all wrap around this place to make is a dining event straight out of Latin America.  Very sexy, however, the place is quite large and was very empty on the Wednesday we ventured over there.

Menu - Expansive, the cocktail list is as long as the menu.  After a few glances at yelp and some notes from the waitress we put in our order; Ceviche, tacos and a few other starters.  Presentation was to to T and very appetizing, the food was heavenly.

Main Course - All i can say is that you will experience new parts of your taste buds that you never knew existed!  The rush of flavors, savory well cooked meats and impeccable arrangements, it was a taste of heaven AGAIN.

Finally, lets close with dessert.  Chocolate cigar!  That's all it takes to top it off, the rich chocolate and coffee was a perfect end to an exquisite meal

You have to GO here, its an enjoyable meal and well worth the price paid."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best food I've ever had in the valley. I called ahead to make reservations for me and my boyfriend and requested a surprise dessert. I asked for them to write \"I love you\" on it and by the end of or meal, they surprised him and he absolutely loved it! The staff was so accommodating and very kind to my request to make it a romantic experience. Our server was also absolutely amazing! He made the best food and wine recommendations. I can't say enough how great this place is! Great atmosphere! Great service! Amazing food and drinks! I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"We went here solely due to the fact that the chef is a James Beard award winner.  I was also interested that it had a Latin flare.  I wish we would have liked this place more.  The décor was lovely.  I even liked the South American wine.  But there were a few things that were concerning.  We ordered several appetizers which came out quickly, but then it took quite awhile for our meals to be served.  They should have timed that out better.  The millionaire tacos were our favorite item, as other yelpers have mentioned (and we normally aren't huge ceviche fans).  The prime rib picadillo empanada also had good flavor.  We ordered the shrimp chicharron appetizer, but it was a bit too sweet and reminded me of sweet and sour shrimp.  Our halibut was cooked well and was more flavorful when eaten together with the fideo pasta, however, it was a bit bland.  Everyone noted the chocolate cigar, and we both did not enjoy it.  The dulce de leche cake roll was also not memorable enough to reorder.  Is Deseo a bad restaurant,  no, but we wouldn't go back.  Oh, almost forgot the yummy bread and butter....best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Came here for NYE.  They offered a 4 course prix-fixe.  In my experience many restaurants offer a prix-fixe for special occasions to limit variety, reduce cost, and increase price.  That was not the case here.  The food was inventive and exceptional.  I had the scallops which were excellent.  Several others had the fillet, all of which were perfectly prepared and presented.  The standout was (interestingly) the chicken... It is a party in your mouth.  I'll be going back just for that dish. Service, as usual, was impeccable."}
{"text":"Nice staff/good service, however, the  food was very bland and under seasoned. We had two ceviches that lacked any kick and the duck empanadas and fried rice were over the top sweet with zero heat. I have no idea how this maintains 4 stars? Perhaps because the resort guests prefer bland mild Latin inspired food ? Two stars for the service only."}
{"text":"I found Deseo on Yelp, and was not disappointed with my experience there.  

Making reservations was easy through Open Table and we were able to get a table for two on a Friday easily.  We were seated promptly (I hate having to wait when I have a reservation) at a nice table.

I had a delicious mojito and my husband Dave had a glass of Torrontes white wine.  The mojito was perfectly minty and limey, not merely a hint of either taste, but bursting with the flavors that make a mojito.

For an appetizer we had a trio of ceviches: the ahi, lobster escabeche, and Ecuadorian shrimp.  All three were different, distinct creations and were really good--we liked the ahi one the best.  The ceviches were not served with chips as we are accustomed, but with popcorn as a palate cleanser.  Their bread and butter were very tasty as well.

I ordered the Cuban enchilado shrimp, Dave had the dorado ajillo.  We also had the brie potato mash.  I really enjoyed my food.  It was spiced beautifully and was very filling.  I didn't really enjoy the brie potato mash, though it's more because I don't really love brie cheese.  Dave enjoyed his meal, though less than I did.  I tried it--it wasn't as flavorful by far compared to my meal.  For dessert we tried the torrejas heladas which was fine but I like chocolate desserts more.

Overall, a great dining experience with really good food and fabulous, attentive service.  If we lived in the area, we'd go back just to try more of the ceviches."}
{"text":"Food doesn't get better than this. Only bad part of our visit to this restaurant was the part we got full, because we had to stop eating this deliciousness. Definitely coming back! The Flatbread was a great way to start, and then came the rolls. Oh the rolls... I had the steak with a side of potato frits, and my fiancee had the daily special. We finished with the chocolate cigar. Everything was extraordinary."}
{"text":"OMG. If you want a taste of Latin heaven, you must try Deseo at the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa. I was whisked away to this beautiful restaurant by the BF (who works at the Westin), under the impression of having \"a drink or two\". And boy did we. The mojitos our mixologist created for us were simply to die for, and I would be hard pressed to state my favorite. The Mango Mojito, The Strawberry Mojito, and even their standard were all amazing (and I tried them ALL). 

But on top of their delicious mojito selection, the food was simply the best. Our waitress (tipped off by the BF to just bring us her favorites), first brought out the Lobster Civiche with avocado tempura in a sweet/spicy sauce. Words cannot express the deliciousness or quality of this meal. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the avocado tempura was a perfect accent, and I couldn't get enough of the sauce - we asked for more bread just to mop it all up. My mouth is literally watering right now just remembering this dish. 

Next up, another civiche with fresh ahi tuna, salmon, and whitefish, mixed with cilantro and jalapenos. Again, simply divine. The fish melted in my mouth. 

After both of these, we tried the popcorn curried shrimp, the tender flank steak, and the millionaire tiny tuna tacos. ALL were of the freshest quality and the most distinct flavors imaginable. 

Finally, our waitress brought out the dessert - a chocolate cigar with cappuccino mousse and candy matches. It was a masterpiece in and of itself. 

My only comment after this amazing meal would be this - All of the food was amazing, but I probably shouldn't have started with the Lobster Civiche. I prefer to save the best for last!"}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast here this morning. I had the egg white omelette and it was fabulous! Hands down the best egg white omelette I have had. It was served with toast and a tasty arugula salad. So fresh and good. The coffee was great and service fast and friendly. Definitely want to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times it was great.  Odd dishes that are surprisingly extremely tasteful.  Unique food and reasonably priced for the service and food quality."}
{"text":"For a foodie, this is pretty much aces. We usually order tapas style (apps to share).  Favorites are the millionaire  tacos, the fried spicy shrimp, any of the ceviches and to top it off... the best dang mojitos anywhere. Go with the Cadillac."}
{"text":"So sad, the old Deseo pretty much left with the chef. 
Millionaire tacos are too mayonnaisey now. 
The \"Waguy\" skirt steak steak was so disappointing. Over cooked and tasted like it was sitting in window all night. 
Service was good and friendly as always. 
Sadly won't be back."}
{"text":"When I see 4 1/2 stars and over 60 reviews... expectations are set.  Clearly I am in the minority, but deseo fell flat.

The service, from the hostess to the server to the bus boy was on point.  In no way do I want to take away from the people who accommodated a late dinner, great job.   The decor was fine, I still felt like I was in a hotel basement and I really got the vibe it used to be a sushi joint, but that wasn't really the issue. The issue was, for the amount and quality of the food... I felt like we got robbed.

My dinner companion tried to order our appetizer twice because he didn't realize we had already eaten it, and he is not missing any screws (that I know of). Delicious yes, substantial no; don't be fooled the kobe beef tenderloin on casabe flatbread is not as hearty as it sounds.  It was the size of my hand cut into 4 smaller-than-tostitos-restaurant-style chips, and this coming from a girl who will fight for a seat at tapas joints.  I understand the concept of ordering several plates and sharing, here you need several plates to yourself and you pay for it.  The soup comes in a bowl bigger than my sink and contained literally a few spoonfuls; for what its worth the consistency on this dish wasn't too great... chunks that sunk to the bottom with super thin almost broth fill the rest of the space.  The arroz tostado en cazuela was a fantastic side dish, and actually ended up being most of my dinner because more came with that, than my actual meal.

I don't really want to keep going because I know I am against the grain here, so put it down to an uneducated diner if you want to scoff... but I felt guilty when the bill came.

The place was not bad, by any means, but overall it was just A-OK when I was expecting a higher level of dining based off Yelp.  I would be embarrassed to recommend this place for a certain price point dining experience, even to people with oodles and oodles of money to burn looking to eat latin american cuisine, in a faux sushi bar, at a hotel.  I feel there are plenty of other places I would rather go for the money, although I'm not above admitting that improper expectations could be the reason we were so disappointed."}
{"text":"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW that's the one word that sums up my experience at Deseo.  

Saturday night for a friend's bday dinner and restaurant week I went with about 8 people and we had a private room.  

For starters I had the chicken posole which had jidori chicken, avocado, tepin salsa and hominy.  I had never had chicken posole before usually always pork but this was really good.  I finished my bowl and actually was craving more.  

Second course was the shrimp chicharron with aji amarillo, endive, and pickled jalapenos.  It was almost the texture of popcorn shrimp but oh sooooo much yummier.  

Entree course I had the loup de mer al huacatay which was a sea bass on top of crab and asparagus pionono, ajillo, and bitter orange.  Wow it was so delectable.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it perfectly.  It was nice to get down to the bed of crab and asparagus that it was sitting on.  

Dessert course was the chocolate cigar.  Such a great dessert.  It was very pleasing to the eye and tasted just as good.   The cappuccino gelato was a great compliment to the chocolate cigar.  I loved how even the matchbook was edible.  

Overall such an amazing dinner one of my favorite meals I have ate in Phoenix and I can't wait to go back to try more of their amazing food."}
{"text":"Great service at the rail.  Unfortunately , even though I wanted to see the chef cook,   the tallest one with a black jacket touched the food without a glove on his right hand with knuckle hand scrapes in all his right hand knuckles. His left hand had a glove. This was an appetite spoiler for me. It will be in my mind next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 Stars

Ate here last night and the night before and had an excellent dining experience.  I recommend sitting at the chef's counter and watch this culinary team do their thing.  This is probably the best Latin cuisine I have had.  The flavors shine and the South American wine selection is great.  I highly recommend eating here when staying at the Westin.    Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It started off a little rough but once the server(His name was Jason) realized how little patience our table had he devoted his attention to us and gave us some of the best service I've ever encountered. He explained the menu thoroughly and knew the wine list like the back of his hand. The food was phenomenal and the pricing was right for the quality we received. I wouldn't recommend this place for children, but would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for some delicious food/nice evening/beautiful environment/great service!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and dine here. There is good reason I consider this one of the 5 best restaurants I've ever been to. I had Millionaire Tacos and my husband had Lobster Ceviche for appetizers. Main course was recommended when discussing what we liked, 4 skewers....grilled vegetables, beef, pork and shrimp. 3 incredible sauces and more. Our asparagus came with a side of ahi tuna salad which was delicious. Dessert was a chocolate cigar and mousse which we split. Everything was 5 star. We were lucky enough to score seats at The Rail and watched everything being made. The cheese rolls were to die for and a nice surprise was I was provided the recipe!!! We ate here while on vacation at the Westin, only wish we didn't live so far away so we could come more often!!!"}
{"text":"Deseo was an excellent experience!!! My girlfiend and I dined here for one of our first dates and theres nothing negative to be said about this place.

We started off in the bar and I had a beer and my gf had a berry mojito. The berry mojito was awesome even though i dislike mojitos. The bar atmosphere is somehwat dark and elegant. They have a wide variety of beers and drinks but they take their pride in making you the best mojito in az. We ordrred an appertizer and when it came out the chef also brought use a free ceviche plate and said he had made too much so it was on the house. I was instantly happy with my first taste of the ceviche, it was absolutely perfect. After drinks and appetizers we opted to be seated and we sat at the ceviche bar. While choosing what to oder we were given more free ceviche complements of the chef. I highly recommend ordering any of the ceviche was the rainbow was my favorite. The tuna and salmon tasted very very fresh. We had the fish special plate and the bone in pork chops plate. Both full of flavor. We finished the night off with chocolate cigars and a coffee liqour drink. Both very good and highly recommended. Be prepared to spend some money but get to the bar for the unwind hour as the drinks are priced well and they are well made.

This is a great place for a romantic date as it is very very nice and an awesome experience. I consider it fine dining and the price somewhat points in that direction as well. Call and make reservations ahead of time and get there early and hang out in the bar i promise it wont let you down."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful from the bread, steak tartare to the complimentary dessert. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Latin American cuisine it's NOT easy to find in AZ. Must Hispanic influenced restaurants are Mexican. But we have found an awesome place and now I know that if I crave some delicious ceviche, Pan de bono, or Mojitos (well made that is) this is the place to go. At Deseo you can find a fusion of cuisines from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador....etc.  I had not have  a PandeBono (sweet cheese bread) since I left NJ.  So If you are looking for a good ceviche or Chimichirri marinated skirt steak make a reservation at this restaurant. It is a bit pricey but  it's inside a resort and the service and the food quality are excellent."}
{"text":"Restaurant week finally gave me an enticing opportunity to try Deseo after staying at the Westin many times but not getting around to it. I sat at the bar, which had a nice dark ambiance, perfect for a solo diner and her notebook - or a date. From the restaurant pri fixe menu ($44) I chose the ahi tuna ceviche, sous vide wagyu short rib with Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes, and dulce de leche flan. The short rib was absolutely amazing. I didn't even need a knife since the meat was so tender and moist. The accompanying Brussels sprouts and potatoes were also on point. The ceviche and flan were good, but not amazing compared to the stellar short rib. I also enjoyed a glass of red wine (30% off during happy hour in the bar from 530pm-7pm) and the bartender was friendly. The only thing that really could have been better was the pacing of the meal - the ceviche and short rib came at the same time. Overall, I had an excellent treat-yourself solo date at Deseo. I would be interested in coming back to try some more dishes - especially the meat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale - Deseo never disappoints.  I especially LOVE their cheese bread - it's unbelievable.  I've eaten a ton of their main meals and frequently order the chef special of the night, which never disappoints.  I love sitting up at the bar near the kitchen and watching the chefs create the magnificent food.  This place is really great.  Consider date night here - it's intimate and romantic!"}
{"text":"We tried Deseo last night for the first time to celebrate our anniversary! Absolutely recommend! Best seafood we've had since we moved from Florida! We sat at the rail and got to watch them make all the delicious dishes, and Daniel was so friendly explaining everything! The millionaire tacos and rainbow ceviche are so tasty and fresh! The wagyu hanger steak with chimichurri was delicious!! And we ended with the chocolate cigar desert a must!! Our waiter, Peter was equally exceptional! We will definitely be returning for anniversary's to come!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty expensive.  Fortunately I had a 50% off hot rate card for food.  FTW!  The apps and ceviche was just ok. The entrees were delicious here.  The steak and the chicken were really good.  I would probably go back just for that if I had the 50% off to eat here.  Otherwise for a $36 steak I'd rather hit up Maestros across the street."}
{"text":"Their wine was mesmerizing!!  Great menu. I took a client here for dinner. Their ceviche options were unique and wonderful. The fish was fresh and whatever they added to the ceviche was perfectly balanced so you could still taste the fish. For dinner, I had their hanger steak. It was good but sort of meh. Wasn't my favorite item. Service was very good!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband on a date night!! Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The place is decorated very nicely and has a modern touch to it. The food was very flavorful, it literally makes you fall in love with it by firing all your tastebuds. t's a little on the expensive side but it's well worth the price. Compared to other high end restaurants the portions here are pretty big.

The ambiance was very romantic with candle lights and all, I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date.

The only aspect that was a little lacking was probably the service, but the food was so great that I was happy they weren't bothering me too much."}
{"text":"Went for Anniversary dinner. We are vegetarians, I was a lil skeptical about the food, looking at the menu. But the chef made his own creation and it was awesome. It was Quinoa with rice garbanzo beans and mushroom all organic. It was delicious!!!


The place was filled on a normal working day, i was surprised to see that. Looks like they had some conference for a firm and people from the conference flooded in. 

Food - Excellent
Ambiance- Excellent

Really good for special occasions."}
{"text":"The potatoes were innovative but way too oily
Quinoa cake and sauce was delicious 
The desert was unremarkable but creative 

They cant make a soup with vegetable stock because it must be frozen and microwaved??"}

Environment: Beautiful
Service:  Excellent
Mojitos:  Awesome 
Food:  Great

The in depth talk in the lobby with the resident artist:  Priceless."}
{"text":"Overall, blasé atmosphere (kinda tacky really - red, orange and yellow color palate, which Arizona pulls off better than anyone, but not in this space - it looked like a converted ball room from the early 1990's) and terribly unimpressive hostess. Can't say anything for the food, the initial disappointment with the atmosphere and service was enough for us to decide not to waste our money on a subpar experience (which it would have been regardless of how good the food was).

We arrived here after having had a negative drinks and appetizer experience at Sol Mexican Concina (which was recommended to us by Allan, a Westin concierge when we said we were looking for a place with local flare and high-end service like The Mission in Old Town - oh goodness could they not have been further from the mark). This was also recommended, so we tried it next. The menu looked okay so we decided to give it a try, the hostess tried to insist on having us sit in the small lounge area, but we wanted a more elegant dining experience since it was my birthday, so we asked to be seated in the main dining area. She just looked at us confused, literally twirling a strand of her hair with both hands (i wish I had gotten a photo of this - it would have been down right comical how ditzy she was acting if I weren't hungry and frustrated with the Westin's poor track record with recommendations so far). Ultimately she did seat us in the main dining area, but along a back wall away from everything and everyone EXCEPT* another couple whose booth was situated so that they were staring right at us (so awkward). There was plenty of other seating in the restaurant but we already felt like we were being difficult so we didn't want to bother them by asking to be seated anywhere else. Our waiter came over and told us about the specials that evening, and we had to laugh because their special was the exact same as the special at Sol Mexican Cocina (skirt steak), which both servers pushed pretty hard. I'm guessing it must have been on sale in the area or something? This was when we decided we'd be happier with a movie, a bottle of wine and tapas in our villa - it was sad because we really wanted to have a nice dinner out, but the remorse would have been much greater had we settled for either of the two sad recommendations we received from Allan, the Westin concierge."}
{"text":"The fact that this is only the 93rd review for Deseo makes me want to break out my pimp hand and slap everyone that is not reviewing this restaurant.  Deseo is easily one of the very best restaurants in all of Arizona.  
Being located in the amazing Westin Kierland Resort only makes it more of a treat.  Walking around before and after add an ambience that driving up to a smaller restaurant in a strip mall will never have.  

I'm not one to go into great detail about the food so I will just say that everything I tried was simply incredible and I would go back a million times (and will to finish trying the whole menu...because I am a serious future fattie.)

Here is what happened: 

Mojitos: The Nectar Grande and the Grand Grande were killer! Best Mojito I have ever had!

Apps:  Millionaire Tacos and Shrimp Chicharron!!!

Entrees:  Yuca wrapped dorado al ajillo (Mahi Mahi-Shrimp-Amarath-Shaved Calamari-roasted Garlic)
                 Kobe Vaca Encebollada (Grilled Kobe Skirt Steak-Huancaina Potato-Oven dried tomato)

Sides:  Maduros Cubanos (Ripped Plantains)
              Alcachofa y Romesco (Roasted Artichoke-Roasted Tomato and Pepita Romesco)

Dessert:  Chocolate Cigar (Chocolate espuma-cappuccino gelato)


They had to roll me out in a wheel barrel....and I applauded the chef heartily as they did so.  

Definitely Stop In!!!  (and ask for server Samantha, she was fantastic.)"}
{"text":"We actually came in on a voucher, so we had a prix fixe menu. Also to be mentioned, I have dietary restrictions (no dairy) so that can be difficult when there are a limited amount of dishes to chose from. HOWEVER, they were still very accommodating. I was bummed tho because I really wanted the mahi mahi wrapped in yuca, but because of my allergy they could only prepare the fish without the yuca, as it was previously prepared wrapped in cheese along with the yuca (bummer, as that was the whole point :/ ) 

Surprisingly, even tho I really couldn't enjoy the main attraction, the sauce the fish came with was FULL of flavor. This is what I expect from a high dollar restaurant. I also had the yuca tacos for an appetizer (had to get that yuca in somewhere!) which were good. For desert, I really didn't expect to eat anything, but they surprised be with a bowl of fruit which was Ah-MAZE-ing.... Berries covered in this wonderful cinnamon and spice infused syrup topped with candied orange rind, I mean EEEKKK!!!! This should be on their regular menu!! Is it? I didn't even check; if its not, I'm telling you, there is some talent in that kitchen and it SHOULD BE on the menu. 

As far as ambiance,  I honestly didn't think it was extra special... I've been to many a restaurant with more thought put into the decor. What it does have going for it are the huge windows facing out to the resort's golf course. I think eating on their patio would be most ideal for a romantic ambience while dining (just maybe wait till November for that) 

Over all it was a positive dining experience and I would recommend :)"}
