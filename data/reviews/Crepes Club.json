{"text":"I went yesterday for Nuit Blanche with a friend of mine. Actually, we tried to go in. It was 9:45pm and apparently this place is open until 11pm on Saturdays. The waiter told us that they were closed when we went in at 9:45pm. What a letdown! You just lost 2 potential customers who will most likely never try to go eat there again. It's a pity cause I was looking forward to checking it out but the really bad customer service on the part of that waiter for lying to us really just made all the enthusiasm for it disappear! I will definitely check out other crepe places in the area, but not CrepesClub, thanks for NOTHING!"}
{"text":"Was here with my friends and I should say that this place is really disappointing. I order borsch, sashlyk, plov, olivie and kvass. The borsch was very salty without meat and the price was 8$ what is pretty high for the small plate! Plov was made with the indian spices which is absolutely abnormal for a ukrainian/russian style of this rice! This fact really disappoint me, because I know how hard it is to find ukrainian spices here in Toronto, and I was assuming to have some good ukrainian food at that place, but.. When it comes to kvass, i drink half of it and later on found out that there is a fruit fly in my cup. I called the waiter (it takes him 15min to notice that we were calling him) and told him to change my drink and his question killed me when he said how do I want him to fill, just a half of the cup? I think if there is smth in the cup, he should surely change to the absolutely full one without questions! He didn't even say sorry! The only good food was sashlyk (russian style of barbecue) and olivie (salad). And the prices for all the foods were really high! Overall I can give -1 out of 5 to the service and 1,5/5 to the food! Would not recommend anyone to come!"}
{"text":"This place should be called Pelmeni Club or Pierogie Club...they are sooo good and so filling. But then again I didn't try the crepes...if they're better than the pierogies or Pelmeni then I recant my previous statement.   We also had the Hunter Smoked sausages which were ok -prob wouldn't order them again though. We had the potato pierogies...was hesitant on trying the cherry ones but will one day. Service was ok...I think it was the owner or manager because he seemed to be the only one around in the front."}
{"text":"Probably the best crepes I've ever had. I always get the Egg, Bacon, Tomatoes, Cheese one and my girlfriend gets the Nutella, Banana, Fresh Strawberries and whipped cream. They taste amazing, and the amount of food you get for the price is unreal - for a crepe under $10, it can easily fill you up for two meals, or a meal and a half."}
{"text":"Visited Crepes Club again, this time I ordered the crepe with salmon and cheese in it, and my boyfriend ordered the mushroom and chicken crepe. We also had a borcht to share. It was nice that this place was pretty empty because we were served faster this time.

Never had borcht before and hated beets, but when I tried the borcht, it was so flavourful and delicious. I could barely taste the dirt taste of beets. Would have it again.

The salmon crepe had a sweet sauce on it and I wasn't a big fan of that. It was also less flavourful than the mushroom one I had last time. Still a decent crepe though.

Boyfriend's mushroom chicken was flavourful but the chicken was really tough and bland. I thought it was going to be grilled chicken but it seemed like it was the chicken they used for boiling stock. You're better off getting the mushroom crepe without the chicken.

Still good food, still would come back."}
{"text":"We had some warm drinks, and a crepe.

Crepe was good and size of the crepe was large, but they were pretty scarce with the supporting ingredients. I think we were the only customers during our stay, so they could have been more generous. Reading the reviews here, maybe we were an exception.

Their coffee is standard, nothing outstanding. The specialty drinks come out pretty, like in that one picture someone posted here. No special shapes or anything though.

Great service. Interior and furniture is standard mid-high class cafe, and clean.

I would not make an effort to come back here. If I am in the area, I would try another place. 

If you are a crepe lover though, you might want to test this place out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have the best borsh I have ever had (and I'm saying that having grown up eating my families Ukrainian borsh). It is the perfect consistency with the right amount of chunks to broth! And the sour cream.....the sour cream is home made, the richest, creamiest you will ever have. Order the pampushka (garlic bread donut) with the borsh, It is to die for (and for epic vampire killing breath!). 
They have 2 kinds of perogies, potato and cherry. Both amazing. The cherry ones are really quite special. If you have never had dessert perogies, definitely check these out. 
Today while dining there I noticed 3 other russian /Ukrainian families in there, ordering in Russian to the waiter. We asked the waiter, and the owners are Russian. It must be good to get families  to come here. Overall, will return! Yummy yummy food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is friendly and the restaurant itself is not very big. Although it is very hard to find appetizing Eastern European restaurants, food tastes like homemade. Best borsh I've ever tried in the restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is a Ukranian crepe restaurant which is a stone's throw from the UofT campus (st george end). Their traditional soup, Borscht, is delicious and the crepes come out in generous portions with rich flavors. 

Tip: Their garlic bread is par excellence

The service was fast and the pricing was just right. This is a great place for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Cheap, great service and delicious crepes.
I've eaten LOTS of crepes from living in Montreal and I'm so happy to find a place close to U of T campus that gives me a variety of crepes in addition to offering homemade perogies, dumplings and the best sour cream sauce I've ever had.
The service was polite, great and recommended great options for us. 

 DEFINITELY try it and bring some friends for brunch. It's super filling and tasty."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little place on Baldwin Street with a colorful ambiance. We went here for a Sunday brunch and had some wonderful crepes. They played lovely music that enriched the background while still allowing us to have conversations. The service was pleasant and friendly. The crepes were delicious - both the sweet and savory ones. I would recommend the mushroom crepe and the egg-bacon-cheese crepe as well."}
{"text":"excellent crepes but you can hear the rats in the ceiling 

:/"}
{"text":"We came here today for an evening out and we're delighted with their food. It's super tasty, homey, and the price for the portion you get is quite good. Their savory crepes in particular are excellent, but their buckwheat is amazing as well. Paired with Kvas it was a great meal! Their service was fast, warm and friendly. Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back. I have yet to visit any other place that has Eastern European food this good."}
{"text":"Decent Russian cafe food but Soviet service. We live in the neighborhood so we have tried ithis restaurant three times. The first two times we were only halfway finished the soup when the waiter threw the main course on the table. That waiter was pleasant and polite--it was the kitchen staff who didn't care about timing a meal so that a customer could enjoy it hot--but the third time we went there, we had a waiter who must have trained in the kitchen: he was rude and truculent, a veritable caricature of a Soviet waiter. This place might be okay for grabbing a snack--at least it doesn't offer franchise food--but it is no place to go for a meal."}
{"text":"This place is great for the Eastern European food. Get \"kvas\" and \"pelmeni\", thank me later."}
{"text":"Lovely food! Very authentic and very accurate as real Ukrainian food. My mother is from Ukraine, and when she saw they delivered to our hotel through Doordash, she got very excited! The mushroom soup is super tasty and definitely something to try. The pampushka that comes with it is sooooo good! Like a savory donut!! I'd also recommend the vareniki with potato, super delicious. The desserts we got were lovely as well. We loved the olivie, a traditional Russian salad that my grandmother and mother make all the time. If you love Russian food, definitely come!"}
{"text":"Greaaat! This time I brought one more friend that had never tried Russian/Ukrainian food before our visit, three of us left being very satisfied."}
{"text":"Came into CrepesClub for a quick dessert run. I was really excited to see a crepe location so close to the UofT campus! I ordered the strawberry, banana and nutella crepe which was good, with my only criticism being that there was a bit too much nutella for my taste (though I'm sure others may be totally content with it). For my palette though, the nutella made it to sweet  and made it tiring to eat 'cause everything was sticking to my mouth. I did like the fact that my crepe was made to order!

I also wish the ambiance of the place can be a bit brighter. We came during lunch time, but the lights were still relatively dim, and since we were the only table it made things just a bit uncomfortable. Even worse when heading down to the bathroom where the stairway and bathroom itself felt kind of creepy.

However from the looks of the savoury crepes and other European dishes CrepesClub offers, my interest is definitely piqued and I hope to come back another day to try out their lunch menu and update my review ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Crepes Club a few times, and had the borscht, some crepes and pierogies. I'm no expert on eastern European cuisine, but so far, so good! The Entertainment Book's coupon brought me here, but the food will keep me coming back. Prices have gone up recently, likely due to the $15/hr wage being implemented. The menu has also been expanded, seemingly as a counter measure."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.
Place is small but nice.
Downstairs washroom is not clean.
Portions are large and very well made.
Around 30 pp for lunch.

Overall food is good, service is good, not a place for a date."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of sweet crepes. I find the over use of icing sugar and chocolate tiring. That's why it was so nice to find this place. Their savoury crepes are to die for. The cottage cheese is a great addition to some of the more savoury and safisticated crepes. The salmon, cottage cheese with garlic and herbs is by far one of the best light lunches I have ever had. Now that's not to say that the sweet crepes aren't good too. I would recommend this place if you are into crepes and European food."}
{"text":"Came again with my GF. We tried the Pelmeni and the peroigies. Both were excellent. Also added a mushroom cream crepe. Everything was great!

The pots of dumplings didn't look that big but we were amazed at how we struggled to finish them. I somewhat wished the portion was a little smaller (and the price correspondingly a little lower). Taste wise it's not too far from Chinese dumplings except it doesn't feel as greasy as your average Chinese dumpling. 

The service is excellent. The guy working there is so nice.

Upgrading to 5 stars. I'm a little sad this place is so quiet. This is one of the few places where you can try something a little unusual at reasonable prices and portions."}
{"text":"Crepes Club is a small restaurant that serves Russian food. I tried the pelmeni (dumplings), which was excellent. However, I found the portion to be small given the price paid.

I also tried the Nutella and Strawberry Crepe, which was also delicious. This is definitely the place to go to for sweet and savoury crepes. 

This place is not a fancy, but it is charming. The restaurant makes you feel like you are eating at someone's home.  

I would recommend giving this place a try if you are in the Baldwin area."}
{"text":"I went here sometime last year with some friends. I thought the overall experience was very good, although more expensive than I'd like. Maybe I'm just not used to these high Toronto prices. Haha 

What we shared:
1. Stuffed pepper: 9/10. This was so good I'd probably go back just for this. There was a nice variety of tastes to this pepper. I would highly recommend. 
2. Pelmeni dumplings: 7/10. I thought these were ok. Not my favorite but still not bad. 
3. Nutella, banana, strawberry, ice cream, whipped cream crepe: 9/10. When is this combination not good?"}
{"text":"*vegetarians and vegans should be careful here*

They make their own sour cream which is pretty impressive, and their perogies were great....But I was little thrown off by the fact that they listed that they had vegetarian borscht as an option, when in fact, they use meat broth. 

I asked our waitress \"is this vegetarian?\" and she said yes it was. But as she walked away with our order, I asked her what kind of broth they used and she said \"meat\". That really bothered me. If I don't want to eat meat, make sure you don't withhold information that can make me accidentally consume it.

Overall, I had an pretty good time. But although the food was tasty, it was pretty steeply priced considering the portion size."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a meal between activities. We were originally going to go to a restaurant down the street, but unbeknownst to us the other place was closed due to a fire. We saw a sign for crepes in front of this little place and we were sold! (Who doesn't love crepes?)

Overall we enjoyed the experience and the food, and we'd probably go back again if we were in the area.

We had:
- crepes with cottage cheese, tomatoes, garlic, herbs, honey
- crepes with apples, pears, cinnamon, honey
- kvass [russian soft drink]
- prune cake
- ponchiki [ukranian doughnuts]

Not being overly familiar with Eastern European food, I can only judge based on my personal taste, but I'm giving them two thumbs up. There was nothing about the taste/quality/presentation of our meals that we didn't enjoy.

Our server was pleasant, professional, and friendly with us; she seemed to enjoy our appreciation for the food and gave us tips on what drinks to pair our to-go order of doughnuts with for maximum tastiness.

We had no issues with wait time, but that's likely because the restaurant was empty except for one other table (on a Sunday evening). Like other reviewers have noted, there seems to only be one server and one cook on the premises. The restaurant has at least a dozen tables so I wouldn't want to test service time on a busy day.

The biggest complaint I'd say I had would be for the price versus the portions, but I guess that's what you get for eating in Downtown Toronto. The second biggest complaint is that the men's bathroom is apparently horrifying. This is in stark contrast to the atmosphere of the dining area, which is clean and charming."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to eat something that has a home taste. We went here and were surprised by the variety of food that always was at my granny's home! Very tasty!:) especially the crepes with mushrooms  Certainly I will go to this place again!"}
{"text":"Absoulety amazing borscht. I am from Latvia, living in Toronto and I swear to God, here I can get the same authentic tasting borscht as back home. It is perfect. Cherry vareniki with sour cream are super delicious as well. Definitely recommend! Prices are good as well, this restaurant is among my absolute favorites in Toronto. Will be coming back and recommending to others :)"}
{"text":"wish i could give this place more stars for their great service
but the dark chocolate & strawberries crepe was not good 
crepe itself had a thick batter so it was rubbery to chew on 
the strawberries were also sour

i left half the plate unfinished
maybe i came on an off day since the other reviews are so high"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is nice and friendly. The food is really good with plenty of vegetarian options. It's also nice to have something different in the area  than Asian food. A lot more than just crepes."}
{"text":"We were hoping to get authentic Eastern European food here - I have been on a search to find amazing borsht in Toronto. The borscht here was $8 a bowl, we found that there was too much liquid compared to the amount of cabbage, potatoes and we barely saw any beets. With wine costing $7-10 a glass, we were surprised that the white and the red wine tasted like old wine that was put into the fridge for who knows how long - we couldn't even finish it!                  

We also got dumplings (pelmeni) and potato perogies (vareniki), they were average. I think the best part of the meal was the fact that they made their own sour cream and it complimented the dumplings and perogies well. Unfortunately, the service didn't make up for the food - stiff and not that welcoming. With the service and food they serve, we understood why they were empty on a Saturday night for dinner."}
{"text":"Good quality food! Very authentic, just how they make it back home . If they get more items on their menu they will seriously gain popularity. Patio is great. Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Ordered a ham crepe and it was delicious. Two sufficiently-sized crepes hit the spot just right. The stuffing-to-crepe ratio was on point, and the sauce had some sort of tangy business going on that countered the typical richness that comes with savoury crepes. One thing I felt is that the crepes themselves could've had a bit more texture - a bit more chewy would be nice. Meal was reasonably priced - $11ish after tax.

Service was a bit slow. One waitress out front, and probably one cook in the back. Probably 5-10 minutes between serving the first and last crepe. Friend asked for water, and was regrettably forgotten. Seemed like a rare mistake though.

Overall, would come back for a lazy Sunday brunch to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"It's great to have a place that serves Ukrainian food in the downtown core. We tried the borsch, pelmeni and Olivye Salad. I liked that they have a vegetarian menu too since I try to limit my meat intake. I will definitely come back whenever I'm feeling home sick."}
{"text":"In the mood for crepes, I came in here this week. I was pleasantly surprised that it serves more than just crepes. It's also nice that there's a place near work that I can go to for something other than pub food, fast food, or Asian food.

I ordered a mushroom crepe and a coke. The mushroom crepe was OK. Surprisingly though, I guess no one gets water or anything to drink unless they order it. Though, I didn't get the coke that I ordered. That's ok because I didn't get charged for it; but I'm somewhat accustomed to having something to drink while I eat.

There were two other tables with customers. There seemed to be one person working the front of the restaurant. I'm not sure if he was helping in the back as well. I think this impacted the service."}
{"text":"After initially being dissappointed, I decided to give this place another try and what do you know? I have already visited it again twice! It is actually my favourite crepe place in Toronto right now. The prices are reasonable - in the range of $9-15 (depending on the filling you get) and the serving size is huge! They really pack it into the crepes - I'm used to most places being stingy on the fruit and things but not this place! 
There's also a large variety of sweet and savoury crepes from the staple Nutella, banana & Strawberry to general tao and terriyaki chicken crepes! 

They sometimes have a soup & crepe combo special for around $14 (Perfect for sharing because the soup is big enough to be a meal on it's own). I highly recommend trying their Borscht soup, it was so flavourful & delicious that I forgot I was there to eat crepes!  

The service is excellent, always fast, friendly and attentive! Here's to giving places second chances! :)"}
{"text":"Don't be confused by the name of the restaurant, they do much more than crepes. I've walked past this place many times, each time thinking, I don't really want just sweets. But one day, my Ukrainian boyfriend suggested we eat there. The result; just wow!

We shared an order of borscht (which they split into two bowls for us) with garlic bread, pirogies, and their meat pancake.  

The borscht: so so so tasty. Even better than my Ukrainian boyfriends family recipe. Served with a dollop of sour cream, and the smell of fresh dill was amazing. The garlic breads were these delicious donut garlic dill flavour bombs. 

The meat pancake: was delicious. Served with a healthy side of sour cream. 

The potato pirogies: served in this cute little pot that kept them nice and warm as we ate through the meal. Try dipping a piece of the garlic bread into the butter / garlic / dill at the bottom of the pirogie bowl. This was also served with nice thick sour cream. Somewhat reminiscent of Creme fraiche.  

The server was a kind man, who was attentive but not overbearing. Two of us ate for 40$ and were super full. Next time I want to order their cherry pirogies. And maybe I might order a half dozen of their donut garlic breads to go for my friends to try. The feel of a family run restaurant. I am only sorry I didn't come in sooner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One or the best crepe place we have tried in Toronto. Don't let the front and interior deceive you. Once you're in and plate is serving you'll be surprised by how great the food is made. I just wish they would invest the decoration a bit more an ad gain more business"}
{"text":"'Twas one nice sunny day at the start of spring-- I was hungry and desperately searching for late lunch at 3pm. I saw Crepes Club and my gustatory instincts said oh yes yes yes! From the outside I thought it was just a small cafe, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually spacious inside. Decors are minimal but charming and without unnecessary clutter. On my table was just a little mason jar with cheery fresh flowers, and a small pretty candle. I appreciate small details like these and it made me happy even prior to getting fed. I noticed though, that the music was a bit off that time I was there. They were playing Lady Gaga songs when I would much rather want to hear something more relaxing like jazz or classics, or perhaps some of those smooth French songs to go with crepes? Then again maybe I'm just an old soul when it comes to music and besides, it's the food that matters. So there I was, once again confronted with a choice between sweet and savoury... The time being 3pm, I figured I might as well have an afternoon snack and chose the strawberry, banana, and Nutella crepe with a single shot cafe americano. My order came within reasonable time-- not overly slow but not too quick either as to wonder about its freshness. It was a feast for the eyes and I had to admire it for a few seconds before digging in. It was a bit too heavy for me though, and a bit too much Nutella-- so much so that I didn't need sugar in my coffee. I don't know if that's a plus or minus factor, but one thing's for sure: they don't scrimp on ingredients and they make their crepes with a lot of love. I think I may have gained 2 pounds after coming here but I have no regrets. Next time I want to try a simple lemon and sugar crepe, or perhaps one of the savoury options. Better yet, I'm bringing my husband along to share with!"}
{"text":"A lot of food here is made from scratch, including the kvass beverage. The server was attentive, quick and polite. My meal was simple, but delicious and very filling."}
{"text":"Service was great and a generous amount of fruits come with the crepe but it could have used a bit more ice cream and whipped cream!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm throwing out 5 stars all the time now, but I have no reason not to.
Came in at a completely unassuming time of 1:30 and had the Borscht and the Pelmeni. They were both awesome.

The Borscht stock you could tell was simmered well as there was a lot of flavour, and coupled with garlic and whatever other spices they put in there, it was very enjoyable. I come from a family that makes Borscht and tasted like gramma would make.

As for the Pelmeni, these things were unlike anything I've ate before. Part shanghai soup dumpling, part pirogi, looks like a tortellini, served in an urn-like dish, and comes with a massive amount of sour cream on the side.

These dumplings were really good. You bite into them and there is some sort of broth that comes out, and the minced meat is flavourful, and full of garlic. So if you don't want some wicked garlic breath after then that may be your only reservation; otherwise you gotta try these at least once in your life. The sour cream was mild and fresh tasting, and went perfect together. The amount of dumplings you get too will be more than enough for 1 person.

Other reviews have commented on the atmosphere and the decor and whatever, but I don't have much of an opinion on there because I came for the eastern european food, and I left satisfied.

The timing and situation worked out to give this place 5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"I literally forgot that I'd been here before until Yelp told me I'd already reviewed it? I guess that's how unmemorable it was. I gave it a 4-star review last time because things seemed okay besides the emptiness and decor, but it seems a second visit two years later has only dropped two stars off my opinion. 

The first thing I noticed was, again, it looks so sad. Not crying sad, but like, pitiful sad. The only reason we knew it was open was because of the little neon open sign. We came in and it was absolutely empty, not even servers were there. We thought we were mistaken til a woman appeared about a minute after uncertainly seating ourselves. 

The first thing she did was ask us if we wanted to be seated by the heater instead, as it was chilly out, which was really considerate and appreciated. I run very warm, so we declined. Then she asked us if we wanted hot or cold water. Since we were both already toasty, we asked for cold. I remember, because I've never asked for hot water in a restaurant, ever. She brings us hot water--whatever, simple mistake. When I correct her, she's annoyed (???). 

Orders come with two crepes, reasonably sized, but I wouldn't say big. My girlfriend and I got the nutella, banana, strawberry crepe. For some reason, they make that here with nutella in the crepe, but with the fruit on the outside instead of inside?? Never seen that before. 

It came with strawberry syrup, and I asked for mine without. Server comes back with  it having strawberry syrup and says \"You wanted no chocolate syrup right?\" My girlfriend's crepe (which came before mine, and how I knew about the strawberry syrup in the first place) had no chocolate syrup, so I can only imagine she meant the nutella? Just...bizarre. I clarified, and again she's visibly irritated with me. It comes back tasting fine.

I also got the spinach, tomato, egg and feta crepe. This one was a huge miss. Partly my fault, because I should've asked for the egg to be omitted. It just didn't fit with the taste of the rest of ingredients at all. Crepe also tasted overly sweet to me, just making the egg thing worse which was gross considering it was supposed to be a savory crepe. There was barely any feta in it at all. I've had a similar crepe (without egg) recently and that was delicious. I wanted to like this one, but it just..did not taste good. 

My girlfriend got a side of sweet potato fries, which she enjoyed. We also both got mochas-- good, nothing special.

Disappointed I came back and spent ~$45 here. Won't be making the same mistake."}
{"text":"This is my favourite lunch spot and I've been recommending this restaurant to friends and strangers alike! My non-Russian friends love the delicious food because its a novelty to them and my Slavic friends love it because it reminds them of their mom's cooking. I have tried the crepes with garlic creem cheese multiple times, I've heard from my friends that the mushroom filled crepes are very good as well. My favourite, though, is borscht and olivier salad, as well as pelmeni (dumplings). Finger licking good. They even make their own sourcream for the dumplings!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't write review but this place is so underrated. I ordered the banana nutella crepe with a scoop of ice cream and it was super yummy. In the past I also tried their savoury crepe (the mushroom chicken cream) and the borsch soup - both were really yummy. Service is fast and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great location to my living place. Crepes are delicious (I had one salmon and one bacom crepe) There was only one staff there at the restaurant so the service is a bit slow, but it was some good service after all. If it is warm I definitely recommend to sit at the patio. If it is your first time going there you can use the Yelp 10% coupon too! Overall I will give it a 8.3/10."}
{"text":"Ordered a crepe from uberEATS and the crepe is BURNT. I can't imagine you serve burnt crepes to customers! Very disappointed!!"}
