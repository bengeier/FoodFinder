{"text":"Awful food and service.  Waited 1.5 hours for the delivery.  Checked the order to find it right but everything was cold. Called and the owner said there was nothing they could do because all food leaves there warm. This is the second time food was cold, wrong, and took 1.5 to 2 hours for delivery."}
{"text":"This place was awful and I won't try it again. First off I tried ordering of their web site.. The order came to 16 something plus then a 4.00 delivery fee. When I went to place the order it said that I was out of their delivery area which I know isn't true... So I called and placed my order. They told me about an hour for delivery.. It was over an hour and a half. When I got the bill it was $5 more than the website said. I didn't want to argue so I paid it. When I opened the Philly pizza it looked disgusting. The pizza was dry and the roast beef that was on it was cold and bland. I took one bite and threw it away. It wasn't worth me calling in to complain because I didn't want a substitute item or wait another 1 1/2 hrs for it to arrive. I would never do business here again."}
{"text":"Ambridge Italian Villa is one of my favorite in town restaurants, I frequently order out and eat here. The food is always amazing homemade greek food! Tonight I ordered the Gyro with everything on it (onions and tomatoes) and it was delicious as usual."}
{"text":"Decent prices and great gyros. Their wings are good (if you like Olive Oil) Their burgers are pretty good (and affordable). Plus they deliver to almost anywhere which blows my mind."}
{"text":"Wrong order delivered.  Took an hour & 20 min.  Cold.  But....Big selection & food is good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out at the counter. Service was terrible. Servers were rude. We waited an hour for a calzone and a gyro. When we got home there was no sauce for the calzone. I specifically asked the woman if it came with marinara. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want it to be in an area without options. Reliable, and punctual. Get the Sicilian crust."}
{"text":"Went down hill a lot. Used to be awesome now not so much. Less portions in gyros than before and still the same price. Delivered on time but the food was cold. Taking my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at. Exceptional variety. Stromboli is my favorite. Delivery is usually quoted at an hour wait, but will often be longer. Better to eat there or pickup."}
{"text":"Food used to be great but each time I get it, it takes longer and is of worse quality. I definitely will be going elsewhere for food!!! Even their gyros have gotten worse!!"}
{"text":"Their gyros are good. Anything else you order (spaghetti, salad, ANYTHING) will taste faintly like gyro. Not sure exactly how that happens but it does.   I've found that in the past couple of years their staff have become exceedingly rude. I can handle rushed, busy, stressed, etc. Rude is unnecessary though. The prices are never consistent (and if you ask about the discrepancy, prepare to have the phone slammed down on you as you wait on hold for a length of time).    The delivery times AND CHARGES are outrageous. Fries are limp and wet, at times almost raw feeling-which is impressive for shoestring type fries. It's just not the same as it once was. Really hoping something's done about the quality and customer service because this place used to be a family staple."}
{"text":"We had the lasagna and the gnocchi (which was on special).  Came w/ a salad if that's what you want to call it. Mostly lettuce with a a couple chunks of cucumber (not slices), a few pieces of onion, tomato and slices of black olives; and NO cheese!  Also came with garlic bread, which turned out to be a garlic bun.  I mean a sliced bun literally! Which really didn't even taste that great.  The meal itself was nothing great.  My lasagna had shredded cheese on top that was partially melted.  Husband said his tasted like chef boyardee.  Maybe the Greek food is better?  Must do alot of delivery because there is about 8 tables smashed together pretty closely."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a long time. The pizza was undercooked and smothered with precooked greasy onions. The Italian hoagie had, in my opinion, an odd choice of cold cuts on it. The roast beef on the hoagie tasted like it was going bad. The wings however weren't bad, but everything else was terrible. My husband and myself ended up throwing away 75% of what we ordered. Also we ordered at 7:30 on a Monday night and our food was not delivered till 9:10."}
{"text":"Great food. Small but nice eveything i have ate here was home made and very tasty. The server was very nice and knew the menu. There was so many things on the menu. This is a place i will be coming back to soon."}
{"text":"Dare I say this mom-and-pop Greek/Italian shop is among the best Beaver County has to offer!?  We decided to sample a little bit of everything on the menu. The prices are right and the portions are decent.   I chose the Pittsuburgh Burger, giving me the opportunity to try both their traditional burger and their gyro meat and homemade tzatziki sauce. Needless to say, everything was big on flavor and I'll definitely be returning to try out their traditional gyro soon!  If good food and good prices aren't enough of a reason to rate a place with five stars, throwing awesome customer service in will certainly seal the deal! I actually found this location using Yelp! and chose to order online via EatStreet. I arrived 15 minuets later, as they were just finishing my order. As they were packaging my food, the friendly server brought out my order of breadsticks to ask if they were to dark. Before I could answer, she apologized, stating that they were going to redo the order since they were not at the level of quality that they would like. I was more then happy to wait an extra 5 min and was ecstatic with how they were able to ward off a bad review by being upfront and honest, using quality communication and a willingness to correct a mistake in lieu of ignoring it! Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"I came for the gyro but I have to say as excellent as the gyro was, the highlight of the meal was the bread pudding!!! It absolutely stole the show and would be the reason for a return trip. I'm certain that based on the bread pudding I would be delighted with any of the homemade desserts."}
{"text":"i moved to beaver county from san francisco/ silicon valley - santa clara, calif. to escape the high cost of living and the traffic.  it took me 1/2 hr. to go 3 miles once. - anyway the place looks like a dive but i was desperate and hungary since i was lost again. with gps and a map i still manage to get lost around pittsburgh cuz its so friggin confusing.------------cheap and good.  i read the other reviews and they said the food went down hill.  i will give it another try but i thought it was good.  and when they told me how much it cost (it was cheap)  i said ---what??? i thought i was hearing wrong.  a huge lunch cost less than $5.----------sorry for the long story-----------i dont know many people in pa. so i have to tell someone my story,"}
{"text":"What a great way to mix Greek and Italian food! Every time I've ordered from here not only do I receive amazing service from the owner and staff, the food is equally as awesome. The menu is huge and you will find something you like.   I'm not a regular gyro person so I always get the chicken one. So good! Very flavorful and the homemade sauce is awesome. The Villa also turned me on to grape leaves. These are a must if you stop by! Not many places actually stuff them with meat (unless you visit a very authentic Greek restaurant) so grab them here while you can. I'm now obsessed! For dessert, try their homemade rice pudding. It's done just right... not too sweet or filling so you don't feel like you've gained a million pounds after eating.   Prices are all very reasonable. This is a Beaver County gem!"}
{"text":"Updated to add two stars. Things have gotten better here. Food is more consistent and delivery time has greatly improved. I order here more often now. Hopefully things stay the same.  Old Updated Review-Italian Villa is going downhill. We no longer order from here, only as a last resort. Deliver takes 1+ hour no matter what, food is never consistent, rude employees and food quality is just not there. Maybe we have bad luck there but until things get better we will order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"I grew up when gyros were their only dish.  Every time I make it back East to Ambridge I still stop in to get a gyro. They have never changed, they still taste great. For the price and the amount given, they can't be beat."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fast, great delivery! Local staple. The burgers and gyros are over filled with meat : )   Recommend the Aliquippa burger and the Greek salad : )"}
{"text":"Gyro platter was very good.  Meat was good which is key. Sauce good, maybe a bit more garlic as the texture was good, needs a little more flavor. Stuffed grape leaves were good, although small and you only got one.  Pitas are strange.  A little more on the bread side which wasn't bad but I enjoy a traditional pita."}
