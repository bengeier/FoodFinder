{"text":"Every time I'm back in St. Lazare to visit family, my wife yearns to have an all dressed pizza from Bravo. I can say I feel the same too, having lived in Chicago, Boston, Montreal and eaten pizza in New York as well, I still think Montreal pizza is the best! 

Of all the pizzerias in the area, Bravo's is my favorite! They also make a decent poutine and their subs are delicious too.

We recently had lunch there on New Years Day as it was one of the only places open. I actually had the 14\" smoke meat and steak sub combo and also ordered a large poutine. The waitress said \"Mon Dieu, vous etes fou c'est bien trop pour manger tout seul\". (English - My God you're nuts that's too much food for one person to eat). But hey I took it as a compliment for tenacity and guts and foraged ahead with my order while everyone at the table giggled in embarrassment. 

I took motivation in the fact that you can't get this stuff where I live and resigned myself to the fact that I would eat it all, or throw up trying! My 6 year old son and namesake rooted me on (and picked relentlessly at my poutine) and told me Man vs. Food would be proud of me. 

The waitress delivered this feast of epic proportions (after a lengthy wait I might add). After she soother her aching back from the sheer weight of my lunch, I asked if there was any prize to be won if I finished my meal. She looked at me like I was crazy and said no. I knew my only prize would be the tab for lunch that day.

The sub was delicious and the poutine was wonderful too. Both met my expectations. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. I'm deducting one star because the service was too slow and the food came out piece mail. They need to do better with this to earn that 5th star in my opinion.

Bravo's was great as it always is, I don't get to eat Montreal delicacies enough, but when I'm back in the area a few times a year, it's always on the list of must haves.

And yes, I finished everything. And no, I did not have a heart attack."}

{"text":"Had the Bravo special pizza which is an all dressed pizza + onions & bacon was good. Not a place ill go out of my way for but was fun trying and must be nice to have for the local residents. Wanted to pay the bill and waitress was interested in chatting with customers then to come get our payment which was a little rude."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to get pizza in the area. Their breakfast is pretty inexpensive as well which is nice."}
