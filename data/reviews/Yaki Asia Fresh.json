{"text":"One friend mentioned she came to this place 5 times in the month. It must be very good. So here we were 5pm walked-in and we were the first customers. 
Food: cooked perfectly. Tasty and very fresh! 
Service: great! Manager answered all our questions.
Recommend: Fried oyster(crispy outside and juicy inside. Super fresh!) Boiled shrimp and snow crab(we had it with garlic butter medium sauce. Tasty with a little kick. Potato well cooked and corn absorbed all the sauce)
We definitely will go back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered two clusters of crab legs with mild Cajun seasoning and it was fantastic! Our waiter was friendly and helped me to decide on a seasoning. It was a great experience and I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"It feels like I've been waiting years for Yaki to open, and it was definitely worth the wait. More Japanese food than Chinese but everything was top notch. The Avocado salad came with a special dressing and it was very fresh. Awesome sauce with the fried dumplings, and the steak yaki is great. It comes with fresh vegetables and some seriously top notch fried rice. 

Everything tasted fresh and was very well seasoned. Yaki is definitely replacing my standard Chinese pickup orders."}
{"text":"So I actually discovered this restaurant from Yelp. So the seafood (I got the seafood combo d) was amazing. The crab legs and mussels were boiled just long enough to absorb the flavor and the medium spice was just perfect for the corn. I didn't really enjoy the potatoes as they were a little hard, but definitely not undercooked! 
Everything was great and there was definitely ample time for pictures (wearing gloves and a plastic bib with a lobster on it make for quality photos). My dad doesn't really enjoy seafood, but he completely demolished the 1 lb. of shrimp and baby clams that he got. 
So some comments on the overall service and environment of the restaurant. I went around 2pm, so there wasn't a huge crowd. The service was excellent with a great usage of the small space of the restaurant. Lots of parking as it is right next to a movie theater and the servers were very friendly and helpful! I'm looking forward to going back with more of my friends and family! 
Also side note, you can call in orders for take out! Which is absolutely amazing! So go now, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Super Yum! FRESH, LARGE SIZED SEAFOOD! Lovely wait staff and extremely reasonably priced. 
My father is a seafood addict, his favorite past time was fishing in the outer banks of NC to attain his favorite type of meal but since he has aged and can no longer manage the long drives and hours spent trying to catch his dinner .. he looks for seafood at every restaurant he dines. So I brought him here hoping to experience something worthwhile and we were not disappointed! We ordered 1 lb of shrimp and 1lb of green mussels with 1 appetizer - we were full and satisfied with a bill that was only $30 even! Can't beat it.. Seafood Fans Unite and support Yaki!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for EVER for Yaki to open, so we rushed right over when it did. They are currently in the soft open phase. 

Their menu was unexpected, in a good way. They are very seafood focused, and many of their meals are served in the style of a low country boil. They also have teriyaki dishes. 

We tried out the salmon teriyaki, which is served with veggies and rice as well as a shrimp boil with medium spicy yaki style sauce. 

The salmon they use is sushi grade, and it was perfectly cooked. The sauce is a little sweet which complements the fish. The veggies were a mix of squash and broccoli. Everything tasted really fresh. 

The boil was excellent. The shrimp are served while with heads, so be aware of that. The sauce is fantastic and we wanted to have more rice from our other meal to soak up all the sauce. 

Service was FAST (less than 10 minutes) and friendly. We will be back; I want to try the mussels."}
{"text":"Came by here today with my boyfriend. We didn't get our hopes up but it exceeded our expectations after we killed the seafood boil. There was just one guy doing everything - cooking to serving so props to him. You can choose the spice and the seasoning - we chose spicy which was perfect for our taste. The closest seafood boil I had was at Wu's on South Blvd but this place is just waaayyyyy better. My boyfriend is a corporate chef and it's hard for him to love a place but he approves! Definitely will return - I'm still craving it!"}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh!

It's cute, it's clean, the menu is simple and edited and the food is fresh as can be!

I enjoyed salmon teriyaki and my husband enjoyed the steak teriyaki.  Not being a major vegetable eater he exclaimed \"I finished my veggies before my steak!\" proudly.

Tons of parking, easy to get to, more seating than you can estimate from the outside and just...go now."}
{"text":"This a great place to get your fix for asian or steamed food.  Plenty of parking and easy to get too.  Friendly staff and fair prices for the amount of food you get.  If you dont like spicy food you can get plain steamed seafood.  If you want something different try the cajun.  Boiled food is great.  You can get a side of fried rice or fries for the kids."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Charlotte. It's a must-go if you love broiled seafood for a good price. The prices beat other restaurants, and the portions are big. The restaurant is small, so if you're going with a large group, it's best to call in advance to reserve a table."}
{"text":"Yaki has definitely earned stars in my book. The customer service was great. They were so nice, attentive, professional, and made sure we were familiar with the menu. I was craving for a crawfish boil and the ones I've been to are kind of out of the way for us and their prices kinda up there. Yaki's prices are so reasonable and the portions they give are generous. Not only that, potatoes and corn are included with each bag of seafood boil while others charge. I will definitely be back and it's so close to home, I can order to-go and enjoy it from home as well. Great business, Yaki. It's been only 3 weeks since opening but I hope y'all continue to grow and prosper."}
{"text":"Yes Yes and Yes
I start with the ONLY thing I wish was different which is the ability to mix multiple sauces into the boil at once. They make up for it by allowing you to have other Sauce on the side so you basically have what you want but I really would love it all in the boil but definitely not a decision changer.
This place is super yummy, staff friendly and definitely a clean restaurant from the entry to the bathroom and back.
My husband and I had been driving from Greensboro moving our Big daughter (my Bonus child) into her off campus apartment for Jr. Year and we were starving and I craved a seafood boil. My husband and I LOVE the ones in Texas, Florida, Chicago And Tennessee and hadn't found a highly recommended place in the QC. I searched and searched Yelp and saw a couple read reviews and was like \"Meh\" until I saw this one pop up with \"Hot and New\" listed. 
We LOVE new places as we like to get first dibbs on the goodness. 
Now approaching the venue which is in a parking lot shared with a movie theater that's pretty busy, you may be deterred as my husband immediately judged and said \"It's empty and there are no cars immediately parked over here\". I responding \"Its open and I'm hungry let's get out\".

We entered and was greeted with a smile. We were sat and the waitress was super into our toddler she came over several times and played with him while taking care of us. She was very informative and friendly. Our food came our pretty quick and it was HOT in both senses and FRESH & GOOD.

We will definitely head back."}
{"text":"OMG! We've been searching for a place just like this in Charlotte and finally! The food was seasoned to perfection, the atmosphere was clean and the customer service was excellent. Will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"I ordered the snow crab leg and shrimp seafood boil combo. I didn't want it to be greasy, so I ordered it with no butter. The only seasoning was dry Cajun seasoning, spice level hot. I called ahead and ordered this to go. I was only in the restaurant for 30 seconds so this is not a review of the full restaurant experience, just the food itself. 

The seasoning was comparable to other 'seafood boil in a bag' type of places. It's a lot of spice but not necessarily Cajun flavor. Unfortunately, the seafood was over cooked. At this price point ($24 for 2 snow crab clusters, about 10 medium to large shrimp, 3 small red potatoes halved and what equates to half a cob of corn), I would expect the seafood to be cooked well. If you can't get that part right, then to me, it doesn't matter what the flavors and seasonings taste like. 

Long story short, I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open forever, just to see something new in the area.  I drove by the other day to see the grand opening signs and looked up the menu as soon as I got home.  I was super excited to see the boiled seafood options.  So tonight I finally ordered food for pick up.  I got 1 pound of shrimp with the house cajun seasoning, hot option, and it was amazing.  Not the, \"I've never had this before\" amazing but the \"I've had this a hundred times and this is amazing\" amazing kind of meal.  So, if you need a new place to try and like this kind of food, go here asap.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"F-ing amazing food!! Had the Dunge & shrimp combo with some stick rice in the garlic sauce with a spice level 3...perfection! 
I shall be returning for other combos!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to find a spot that offered crawfish (especially Cajun style) as I haven't had any this season yet. Unfortunately, the House Cajun sauce Yaki offers isn't quite true Cajun style, and I felt a bit misled. 

I got an order of the green mussel yakitori (absolutely delicious) and the crawfish and shrimp combo in medium House Cajun sauce. The combo comes with a few pieces of cob corn and red potatoes in a steamer bag. They give you a bib, gloves, and a bucket to discard shells in. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and tasted really good dipped in the sauce. The sauce was salty and spicy and left a nice tingle on the lips. My nose ran a little. The crawfish were monster-sized but definitely overcooked. 

The restaurant is on the smaller side and offers a handful of booths. Service was nice. You pay at the counter after finishing your meal though."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for good seafood you have got to try one of their seafood boils! I did the crab legs boil with their garlic butter (which was AMAZING) in the boil you get 2-3 corns of cob, & maybe 5 whole red potatoes cut in halves & 2 clusters of crab legs drenched in their seasoned butter which was heaven on earth for a seafood lover like myself! 

The lemon pepper wings were also very good nice & tangy with a slight kick, the cajun wings are also tasty! As far as sides go the seasoned fries are delicious, fried & seasoned to perfection! 

The best part of ALL OF THIS is the price..the owners know how to do it good food for good prices! We can't seem to stay out of this place  try it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, my first time here! I had the snow crab boil. The crab was meaty and the garlic butter was just garlicky enough without being over powering! Potatoes and corn were a dreat addition, not to mention surprising! You have lots of choices and its all good! The chef asked me if I had encounterted this style of asian cuisine, I had not. He said its a cross between asian spice and a low country boil! Your food arrives at your table in a double plastic bag and hot! Also provided are a bucket, bib, plastic fork and gloves...yes, gloves! This gets deliciously messy! 
Hungry as I was, I went back and ordered the fried shrimp app and an extra order of corn! Oh my! Goodness abounds at this place! Seating is limited, but thats okay!"}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoyed the food. I had the Dungeness crab and shrimp. The crab was a little salty for my liking, but everything else was good. Service was also very good. They also serve Asian food (yaki soba and udon noodles, fried rice, etc), which my friend ordered, but didn't really like. Still, I will most likely visit again."}
{"text":"I have been so excited for this place to open and they certainly did not disappoint! Flavors were amazing and the seafood came out low country boil style in a bag with a bib and gloves the way it should! I cannot wait to go back and try other items on the menu. The staff genuinely cared about their menu and everything came out very quickly. I hope to see their success!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for a late lunch and I am so glad we did.  The service was great.  Our waitress made sure to describe and explain the items on the menu and flavor/spice choices we had.  That was very helpful.  She kept up with us and made sure we had what we needed.
My husband, not a big seafood person, ordered the lemon garlic chicken wings and the chicken teriyaki. The wings were great. The skin was crispy and the lemon garlic flavor was just right.  I'm not a big chicken wing fan and I will order those for myself without hesitation on our next visit.  His chicken teriyaki was very good too.  The portion was good sized and the teriyaki sauce was just as you would hope - light but very flavorful.
I ordered the avocado salad and the shrimp boil.  The salad was large (easily enough to share with my husband) and everything was very fresh.  The top of the salad was covered in avocado slices.  Very good.  The shrimp boil was wonderful!  My husband laughed when I put on the bib and gloves but he understood why when I started to dig in.  The shrimp was plentiful (a pound) and was accompanied by several small cobs of corn and red potatoes.  I chose the Yaki seasoning at the mild level (I'm a spice wimp).  It was very good and still had a pretty good kick for me.  Everything was fresh, flavorful and plentiful!
This place is small so seating larger groups would be difficult.  They do offer take-out which will be a great option to take advantage of.   I can promise you that we will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"The Crawfish is PRECOOKED. Ordered the chicken yakitori, texture of the chicken was like frozen chicken nuggets. The mussels are frozen and a  chewy. I order the yaki special flavor for crawfish which tasted ok. The regular garlic butter is way better. Everything is served in disposable cups, plates etc. Server was nice. The fried rice is made using sushi rice. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Not the best crawfish. It was very bland and oily (Asian chili oil)! 
Ordered the crawfish and shrimp with hot yaki flavor; it needed salt and lemon!! If you had crawfish from GA, do not expect the same flavor. Props for waitress being attentive."}
{"text":"The seafood here is great! It's served boiled in a bag and full of flavor. The garlic butter is a great choice. It also makes it even better when you add some spice. You also get gloves with your food so you don't even have to get your hands dirty if you don't want to. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The crawfish is actually not bad, season is right.  The price is reasonable.  I just wish the crabs can be more fresh.  The server was nice.  look kind of slow for a Saturday night. The wait is not long."}
{"text":"I've been here around 4pm and got chicken teriyaki. Good size portion for $7.25 and place was empty. Also came and made our own boil. We got snow crab legs and shrimp combo and added black mussels and extra shrimp to share between 2 people. Also, got an order of edamame and it came to $53.  We got the Cajun flavor but want to try the house special Yaki flavor. We will be back regularly"}
{"text":"Great food. One of the best food experiences I've had since I moved here to Charlotte. 

I had the crab legs and shrimp combo and it was so good that I got another pound of shrimp. 

Had the Cajun sauce extra hot and it was great. Also the Yaki sauce hot and I wish I had gotten that extra hot as well.

Definitely try this out. I'm highly encouraged to find a good seafood restaurant so close to me."}
{"text":"YUMM!! This is THEE place to go in CLT for seafood boils! We'll be back again! The Yaki special sauce I our favor! And the owners are super nice!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been so excited for this place to open and actually went twice their opening weekend this past weekend. We LOVED it and are so happy to have such a tasty restaurant in our backyard.  
The manager is extremely nice and welcoming. He truly wants to hear feedback on how they can improve and what you thought of your experience. Friday's visit my husband got the steak yaki and Saturday we were dying to try a seafood boil. We went for the Dungeness crab (Cajun medium spice- awesome) and we tried the chicken fried rice (because I can always judge a place on how good the fried rice is. Yaki's chicken fried rice did not disappoint! Yum!)  You can go big with some of their seafood dishes or you can stick to the more traditional items they offer which are less expensive. Yaki will become a regular place for us!"}
{"text":"The menu is a little bizarre but nothing too alarming. It's like seeing donuts & french fries on a Chinese carry out menu. I guess it kinda makes sense?!? The food was ok. Nothing to rave about. Speed of food preparation I expected to be quicker.  Food was ready in the time that it would be in a nicer place, but you're sitting on what feel like a Dairy Queen. Maybe it doesn't work after all."}
{"text":"Good food I ordered the boiled shrimp and crab legs food was cooked just right I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food was Delicious!!!!!!! I had the Crableg and Shrimp Boil Bag . AMAZING . They gave me gloves and a cute Bib .will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to find a seafood boil place in Charlotte. My beau and I ordered a king crab leg and shrimp with an additional order of a pound of shrimp with the spicy garlic sauce at a \"hot\" level. Oh boy, when they say \"hot\", they mean \"HOT\". The order was just enough to satiate my hunger and craving for deliciousness- it was filling enough for two people. So, the spicy garlic flavor was one of their new flavors and I wasn't crazy about the taste BUT I was very impressed with the ingredients they used to extract the flavors. In the double bagged goodness, there were plenty of garlic slices, cilantro, and red pepper for heat. It was perfect addition to top off each bite with a slice of garlic. That type of appreciation for the basics is enough for me to come back whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"The seafood boil is always on point. Today I had clams & shrimp boil. The food is consistent. Ask them to boil your corn a little longer it will be perfect! You must visit this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood restaurant , I come almost every week, so delicious . Very good Service they know what we need . Super recommended ."}
{"text":"Great seafood!! Finally found yummy seafood place in the area and it's Clean! We will Definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"I saw outstanding Yelp reviews for Yaki Asia Fresh and decided to try for myself this past Sunday.The reviews were accurate!I ordered the shrimp and crab legs boil.I forgot the name of the seasoning/butter sauce.However,it tasted amazing.I was so surprised because the seafood was so fresh.

The customer service is a plus.You really feel valued as a customer.

The space is more on the small side so I wouldn't recommend to visit with a large group.They are very accommodating though because I saw them seat a family of about 15 with adults and children in the back.

I plan to make another visit to this restaurant to try other options on the menu.Go check it out!"}
{"text":"VERY friendly and helpful staff.  Food was very fresh and flavorful.  Boil was great, however the head on shrimp were extremely difficult to peel, lost a lot of meat with the shell.  Will return soon."}
{"text":"Grand opening today! Went for lunch. Ordered the Guoza appetizer. Thin crispy wrapper was really nice. Not thick and gummy. The filling was good as well. My husband and I ordered the shrimp (Head on). They were a good size. Fairly large not over cooked at all. I had the garlic butter and mu husband had Cajun, medium spice. I have to say it was so nice to have good quality seafood prepared well at a fair price. I hope they can maintain the quality and are consistent in the future. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted seafood for her birthday and I was suggested this place, it's kind of far from where we live but from the great yelp reviews we had to check out. We were a party of 6 and seated immediately, it was kind of tight, as other helpers stated the restaurant is on the smaller side. Our server Tiffany was great, very attentive and answered all questions. I got get the shrimp boil, head on - 1 lb Cajun mild and 1/2 lb lemon pepper mild. Food came out timely and everyone was raving about how great it was. It was so good we came back like 3 days later, I ordered the same thing except got the Cajun bag hot this time. Other people at my table got different seafood and flavors that I tried - the garlic butter is so good and I will be getting that next time! Two people at my table ordered salad and neither liked it. Stated lettuce wasn't fresh and they weren't fans of the dressing. Service slacked this time, it was only the cook and manager working so he was our server. Food took way longer and my order was messed up (shrimp wasn't head on, seasoning forgot on lemon pepper). Since I waited so long I didn't send back, food was still very good and made up for wait and screw ups. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is so wonderful!! You will get stuffed, 3 of us diner there tonight. One got the shrimp, one got the mussels (best I ever had) and one got the crawfish boil. The shrimp I got the garlic seasoning, the others got the Cajun. We were not disappointed and have some serious full bellys!! The place was clean and service was above and beyond exceptional."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! The Cajun seafood bag is off the hook!!! So good best seafood by far in Charlotte!!! Eat here a few times a week."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The shrimp boil was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. Very messy but it's part of the charm. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend.  I've only eaten 2 things there...for a reason.  Fried rice and their shrimp boil.  Both are fantastic!  Keep going back to those because they are always good.  Why mess with it?  Kids keep wanting to go back even though the location isn't close, worth the drive.

Owner is a good guy too."}
{"text":"-MAGGOTS!!!! Ive been here once before my last trip I'll ever make. The food was ok at best but today 11/12/17 my girlfriend found a MAGGOT in her vegetables. I will never go there again. The owner said that they don't use frozen vegetables and that this kind of thing happens. I'm sorry but in no way shape or form should I find maggots in any food while eating out. We walked out right away.-"}
{"text":"Dudettes and Dudes of Charlotte! You must drop whatever you are doing and head to Yaki NOW! This tucked away little gem is everything the Eastside (in the Sardis Woods area just Northwest of Matthews) has been waiting for with regard to Asian food.

Today I started with the Shrimp Yakitori which came very quickly and cooked to perfection. The glaze on them left my mouth dying for more.

I then received my entree of Steak Teriyaki with Fried Rice and Fresh Vegetables. The word \"fresh\" needs to be emphasized. The vegetables were not overlooked or limp in any way. They were firm, fresh and bursting with flavor. They were actually JUICY! I finished them before I finished my steak and fried rice!

Oh the fried rice. So so so delicious and made with imported Japanese rice. Next time I will get an order of the fried wife with some choice of protein for sure.

The steak was seriously perfectly seared to medium and coated in their delicious Teriyaki. Excellent portion, juicy and tender. Perfection.

The location is bright and clean, small but more spacious than it looks from the outside. It's a bit warm in the summer but that's hardly a deterrent. The staff is welcoming and friendly and prompt!

I will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"I love seafood and am always looking for a new place to eat. I stopped by this place based off a suggestion from my sister.

I ordered a bunch of seafood with different sauces. I loved both the lemon pepper and yaki special sauce in level HOT which was just the right amount of spicy. The seafood also tastes pretty fresh and portion sizes are generous for the price.

The only thing I could suggest is that they cut down the oil in the sauces.  My food was dripping with grease. I still gave them 4 stars because the service was great, restaurant was clean,  and I enjoyed my experience overall."}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place tonight I ordered the shrimp yaki and it was really good! I was pleasantly surprised I can't wait to try other menu items"}
{"text":"I had the 1 lbs. shrimp seafood boil. Delicious. Enough for 1 person. My wife had the chicken teriyaki. Seemed a healthier option than regular Chinese restaurants. Deff. Go for the boil. Next time I'll try the combo. Staff very friendly with quick service."}
{"text":"I had to write this review right after our dinner tonight. My little family and I really enjoyed the food here. As others may have mentioned this is a fairly small restaurant so it may take some time to get a table. However, the staff was very attentive to let us know that we were next and constantly checking up on us. My husband is from Louisiana, so we really enjoy seafood boils and he knows his stuff. We have ate at Flaming Kitchen, Cracking Crawfish (which i would never do again), Seafood Connection, and by far this is our favorite. The staff is super friendly and attentive. A perfect example is I guess a party placed a fairly large order and it had another table waiting on their seafood boil for a bit. And the gentleman whom I believe is the owner came over there to apologize and explained the reason why it took so long and to even make it up to them provided them with a complimentary round of beer. And very few restaurants do that. So I thought that was very kind and generous of them. We ordered chicken wings, we had to get that plain for our girls because they're very sensitive to spicy and french fries for them. To be quite frank that was just plain average. However, OMG their seafood boil was sooo good. My husband ordered a pound of crawfish in lemon pepper extra hot. And for him he said it wasn't that spicy so perhaps maybe we can ask for them to keep it up a notch for him. However, the sauce was so delicious. We also ordered a combo of Shrimp and Crablegs in lemon pepper mild with a side of garlic butter. I love their lemon pepper and I love their garlic butter sauce. It's just something out of their sauce that they perfected. We definitely look forward to coming back and to try their Yaki flavor and cajun. The seafood is super fresh, and clean and delicious. I just kind of wished the corn was cooked a little bit longer because it seemed like it wasn't cooked completely all the way and to soak up more flavor. However, compared to other restaurants this is by far the best deal. Others one even if you order a pound of seafood, corn is not included or potatoes are not included. Whereas with their seafood boils do not include it. I truly enjoyed the food and staff and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You have to understand that this isnt a \"nice\" restaurant. Prepare to dawn a bib and chow down. Shrimp and crab boil was fantastic. Yaki style was spicy but not overwhelming. Gyoza was on point."}
{"text":"I grew up on the water so I am hardcore about my seafood. I wanted to try this place before I brought anyone else. I went after work around 4ish on a Tuesday. Oddly, I was the only person there the entire time! It's VERY small, so I can't imagine it being packed with people. 

I ordered the snow crab leg bag w/ garlic butter spiced to medium. It was a little less \"buttery\" than I expected but was excellent!! The crab legs were sooo fresh! And it came out pretty fast too.  I was not a fan of the corn note the red potatoes. Both need to be cooked longer in my opinion. I also ordered a side of the seasoned fries. They were a little over seasoned but tastey! 

One improvement I would suggest: there is no explanation of the flavors. Yes, some are rather self explanatory but specifically the yaki house flavor. When I asked, I was told it's Cajun mixed with Asian spices.  I'm not a chef so I have no idea what \"Asian spices\" consist of. The lady taking my order seemed annoyed at my questions regarding flavors so I asked if there was a way to taste and she stated no. I would have maybe tried something different but I'm not gonna spend $20+ and have no idea what I will be getting. 

But overall, I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Just got back from the restaurant full and satisfied. The food was delicious. I had the pound of shrimp, Cajun style, while my wife had the crawfish, Cajun style. I do have to warn you though. You can order the meal mild, medium, hot, or extra hot. I love spicy food and was tempted to do the extra hot but glad I didn't. The hot is spicy enough and you'll get a nice endorphin rush. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The boil is excellent. Husband loved the medium Cajun boil. It was great. For non seafood eater, fried rice was good too"}
{"text":"Great value.  Maybe a four star for food quality, yet a five star for food at this price."}
{"text":"Soooo good ! One of the best crab boils I've had. The yaki special sauce is awesome. I had a lb of shrimp and also lobster. All tasted very fresh. The chef (owner?) greeted us personally and was very nice. Must try !"}
{"text":"The cuisine fusion between Japanese and southern style seafood is a bit funny to me, but it worked out for my family. My younger brother is a picky eater (not a seafood person) and was satisfied with teriyaki chicken while the rest of us ate from the seafood boil selections. 

I ordered 1 lb of the crawfish boil and LOVED it. I was initially worried that 1 lb wouldn't be enough because it's mostly shell, but I was very satisfied and couldn't finish the accompanying potatoes and corn. I also like how you can chose your flavor and spice level. I love spicy foods, so I chose Cajun style and the \"Hot\" spiciness. I was tempted to try the \"Extra Hot,\" but I'm glad I didn't because the Hot level was just perfect. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small inside, so beware if you want to have a group larger than 6. They do take-out orders, though. 

My favorite touch was the bib and disposable gloves they provide for the seafood boils. It's a messy eat but delicious, so don't hesitate to try it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both  had the steak,fried rice and vegetables.The steak was cooked to perfection and our dishes were delivered fast. The space was clean and staff very friendly. We are definitely adding this restaurant to our list of neighborhood choices for dinner."}
{"text":"If you love seafood this is a place to be.  This is a quaint little place used to be drive through grocery store.  This is my second visit to the restaurant and so far very impressed of fresh seafood and great service.  We don't eat too salty but yet very spicy and they can trimmed down the saltiness for us. We  try crawfish, dungeons crab, shrimp boiled,  and baby clams so far everything so fresh and flavorful.  We don't live to far from this place so glad they open this store in this neighborhood.  As I'm writing this I have craving for coming back.  They are planing to open larger location in uptown very soon I think they will do really well there!"}
{"text":"I ordered the one pound shrimp boiling seafood, with house cajun seasoning in mild. The shrimp were delicious and the red potatoes soaked up the cajun seasoning.  The most surprising part was the corn. Most restaurants use frozen corn in their seafood boils, which means the corn is mushy. Yaki uses fresh corn and it shows. The corn also soaks up the seasoning while still being crisp. Our server/chef pointed out that they use fresh garlic which really complements the potatoes. He was very kind and knowledgeable about the ingredients. They provided gloves and a bib since the seafood boil gets messy. 

I highly recommend Yaki Asia Fresh and will return to try the shrimp and crab combo."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time for work and was excited to see it was open! Went for the first time for lunch and got the 1lb shrimp boil with medium Cajun sauce and an avocado salad. They were nice to split the avocado salad for two and we each got a good portion. The shrimp was delicious! We got head-off and it came with two corn and a lot of potatoes and garlic. It was so, so good. The corn was juicy and crisp and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. The spice level at medium was perfect for me- good spice with a little heat. The manager was very helpful and friendly with explaining the menu. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, super flavorful seafood boil. I recommend getting the Dungeness crab. It's way meatier than the snow crab, and only a few dollars more. The lemon pepper seasoning is my favorite of all of the options. The fried gyoza appetizer is good also."}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I ordered clams & a combo of crawfish & shrimp.  Excellent. I ordered via Postmates.  The food was still steaming hot so I can just imagine how hot it would've been had I ate in.  
Sorry no pictures.

{"text":"Small restaurant, BIG FLAVOR! Yaki was delicious! It's like a low country boil meets Asian zest! We loved the Dungeness crab, crawfish, the clams with Yaki's sauce was over the top! Staff was very nice and our waitress was very attentive. A well thought dining experience with gloves, bibs provided, you will need them. We can't wait to go back and enjoy more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Servers name was Tiffany . Rude and had an attitude. She didn't check in on us to make sure we were okay as customers . Instead she was having a heated conversation with another employee and was more concerned with getting to eat her own meal . She also seems rushy, as we were the only guest in the restaurant one hour before close . Food was mediocre at best. Lots over oil , very small crab legs and shrimp and a tad overpriced for the quality of the food outside of the poor customer service . I will not return, mainly due to the poor customer service and secondly the flavorless crab boil ."}
{"text":"I was definitely satisfied with my food! It's a new place and I'm so glad that we actually have a restaurant like this in my area cause I hated driving to the north or south side of Charlotte just for seafood boil! Crawfish was GREAT! Perfectly seasoned plus the potatoes were so tender! And it's only 5 mins from my home! This will def be my go to place for a good Cajun seafood boil !!!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in as long as I can remember. The crawfish boil was the perfect amount of spice and was super cheap for the portion they give you. Incredible meal that I'm going to dream about until I get a chance to go back. Yum."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! It's back in the cut off Sardis and it looks like a drive through but you can also dine in. It's not good for groups but for 4 people at a time in your group. Prices are great for the amount of food you get. The quality is great as well. The food got to me freshly made in about 13 min which isn't bad at all. Service is cool but nothing to brag about. I'll def come back to this spot. You all should check it out too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for quick dinner . Had chicken teriyaki with fried rice and shrimp teriyaki with fried rice .. very flavorful and tasty food . Not greasy . Service was great and the place is clean .. next time I'll definitely try their boil platters ."}
{"text":"Seafood is so good ! I've stop counting how many times I've been there . Consistently good !"}
{"text":"Great spicy  Cajun seafood boil. Pricey and a little messy to eat (shells are left on) but tasty"}
{"text":"Dang good idea for a restaurant, these guys have it figured out. Great food at great prices, low overhead and good quality control.
The Terriaki  Chicken was good and tasty, as was the Shrimp Terriaki. Both served with Rice and perfectly steamed veggies, no beer or wine yet but water was ok. They did have soft drinks and Juice, everything is served to order and fresh, everyone behind the counter was very pleasant. We shall return, its fast, Yummy and in my hood!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered steak teriyaki. Portions were sufficient but no bargain for what I spent; steak was very chewy and more than fair share of fat. Teriyaki sauce was tasty but could not overcome the fat. Rice tasted, and had the consistency of having been cooked long before and sat in a pot. Mixed veggies were hardly \"mixed\"; mostly broccoli with 1 very limp, mushy slice of squash and 2 mushy carrot slices. It's presentation looked nothing like pics on yelp and Facebook"}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews but today my boyfriend and I walked in and decided to try it for the first time! We thought it was delicious!! And not to mention that the place looked cleaned and organized! Definitely looking forward on going more often :)"}
{"text":"The seafood is so fresh! Garlic butter is my favorite flavor, but lemon pepper isn't too far behind. Easy place to overlook, but we'll worth the stop."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try!
We went in 7/29/17 and were very surprised by the quaint building offering such good food. We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrées. For $36 it wasnt bad. The cook even came out to check to see how everything was. This is only their 2nd weekend open. Hubby and I were really surprised at how moist the steak and chicken were in each of our dishes. I was a bit disappointed I was unable to get chicken and shrimp teryaki, which happens to be by favorite. Also, the pinkish shrimp sauce was not served with our entrée. The seafood seemed a bit overpriced for me considering it was frozen. For it being brand new I didn't expect a great deal of variety,  but it was very surprising that the food was yummy and I had a few select options! 
We will not be going back to dine in because its very limited seating and I imagine as they grow the indoor diners will be plenty."}
{"text":"Went to Yaki Asia Fresh this past week. The building is fairly small, but clean. It's honestly pretty confusing with how it works because it straddles the line between strictly counter service vs. table service. They'll seat you and take your orders like a regular sit-down restaurant; but you pay up at the counter when you are finished. 

I like how this place is a no frills, straight up seafood place. They have paper lining the tables; they give you bibs and rubber gloves; and they just plop your seafood boil down in a plastic bag. Feel free to dig in and get messy :)

I ordered the Dungeness crab combo, girlfriend ordered the crawfish & shrimp combo and green mussels yakitori appetizer. Mussels were delicious, and not overcooked/rubbery. The plastic bags were new to me; but I noticed quickly that this let my food stay warm as I devoured all the delicious crab that I ordered. Corn on the cob was fine, but the potatoes were undercooked. Girlfriend felt that the crawfish were overcooked. 

I want to give this place a 4.5. Service was good, I enjoyed the food, and I would come back here again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Nice and hot. I ordered the shrimp, crab legs, and half pound of green mussels. It comes with potatoes and corn. Everything was GOOOD! I wish I ordered a couple more potatoes because they were good. Next time I will get the my sauce a little more spicy. I like spicy. The customer service was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. If you like to try new places, this is the place to get your hands dirty. One of the only spots in Charlotte where you can get a great southern boil!!"}
