{"text":"This place has opened well, with an abundant staff and good (bar) food.  It has a great location and a little bit of a country feel to it; I hope it does well.  The space is large for this location, so the tables are spread out, and there is a large pool room.  Service is prompt and friendly.  The beer list is not extensive, but the cocktails are good."}
{"text":"Second visit... Turkey Reuben was a hit the first time, tonight a Firehouse Burger got the test... 4 out of 5. Plus free wi-fi, Kylies is a solid place!"}
{"text":"I never realized how many good deals could be found in your local weekly paper (e.g. Citizen, Herald Weekly).  A deal is how I decided to give Kylie's Sports Bar & Grill a try (buy an entrée and get an entrée free...sweet!)   Atmosphere - Unique front wraparound porch, TVs and TVs (49 to be exact), inside is deceptively large, sports bar feel, friendly, accommodating to group events (a group was having a card night on my visit)   Food - A lot of the choices at Kylie's are a notch above your standard local bar fare of fried things...i.e. they have steaks and unique pasta dishes.  To start, we had the Sampler Platter consisting of mozzarella sticks, Southwest eggrolls, chicken fingers, and Buffalo wings.  For the main dish, I ordered the Pasta Ya-ya w/ chicken.  The sampler consisted mostly of shipped in frozen and then heated items...but the wings were very good.  I really liked the sauce on the wings, as it was spicy without being too spicy.  Next time I will definitely opt for just the wings as an appetizer.  The main dish, which was recommended by the server, consisted of penne pasta, red and green bell peppers, fresh white meat chicken, and a small slice of garlic toast (see photo).  With this dish, you get your choice of sauce.  I went the Cajun sauce, which was also based on the recommendation of the server.  While initially disappointed with the choice because the sauce was cream based, I quickly forgave as the sauce was well balanced and delicious.  I definitely will consider this sauce again on another visit.   Service - Helpful, cheerful, willing to fix after seeing my disappointed face when I notice the sauce on my dish was cream based...glad she didn't   Overall - I enjoyed my experience here.  While some of the selections may be similar to a chain sports bar; there are enough unique items on the menu to make it okay with me.   FYI - If you want to download their menu, be patient as it is a 16 MB file."}
