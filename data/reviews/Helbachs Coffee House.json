{"text":"Upon entering, the inside is decorated really well. No one was in line so it was quick. As soon as I sat down that's when the vibe began to pick up. If a coffee shop could be a reality tv show - this one could be it. Co-workers arguing, young teens flirting at the counter, the store even began to look like a staged set for filming.   My food came quick and my drink - drink was pretty sweet, food was okay.  There isn't really a coffee culture present, just the idea of a cute space to work, with coffee types of drinks and food present.  I would stop by if I was in a dire need of coffee and it's the closest thing otherwise not my vibe."}
{"text":"I got the sidecar drink, a bit expensive at $6.00 for a drink (but that is comparable to Starbucks). It came with a delicious tiny chocolate chip cookie on top too, so the price was forgiven. It is an adorable little coffee shop. I love the decor and it has a very clean and new feeling to it. I think some summer drink specials would be great and I'm looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Cute space, a nice mix of kitschy and rustic. Espresso and coffee is from Just Coffee. My double shot was dark, rich, with a beautiful crema and not much acidic aftertaste. I'd stop again - the coffee was very solid, even if it didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"I have read great reviews about this coffee shop and driven by it several times, so I though I would drop by for a late lunch.   I came into the shop around 4 and was immediately greeted by a friendly worker. I ordered the Chicken Cashew Croissant ($8.50) and the Pure Health Smoothie ($5.00). The sandwich came on a fluffy croissant with a generous amount of filling. The spring greens were fresh, the grapes were crisp and sweet, chicken and the dressing were delightful. The smoothie was my personal favorite. This Pure Health smoothie contained papaya, beet greens, berries, and protein powder. I wasn't expecting much, but this smoothie was one of the best I had. You could tell they used real fruit and it was not too sweet.   The bathrooms are tucked away in the corner, and they were very clean.   Although the price was a bit high, the quality was worth it. All in all, it's a great place for small gatherings for lunch. I will surely return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awful people. Seriously, the owning family was rude and pretentious. The gall of these people to have a drink with karma in the name when they were clearly inviting bad vibes. And a drink stolen from Starbucks that's not even made properly? I think I'll stick with friendly baristas, thanks."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance and patio, but the staff seems very unorganized and a bit aloof.  5+ minute wait without a line.    There were only a couple of people in the shop (who had already been served) and one car in the drive thru and after walking in and thinking, WOW this place looks great and huge bonus for the comfy chairs and expansive outdoor seating area.   Then....I waited 5+ minutes standing there without being served as three employees fumbled around and said they'll be right with us, the other woman and I in line looked at each other dumbfounded.  Now you might think it was really busy and chaotic in the shop, but it wasn't.   Seems like a nice place, but not a good fit if you're looking for a quick drink or breakfast pastry, at least not on this day.    I'll give them a second chance on a day where I've got a couple hours to hang out, but mixed feelings and underwhelming first impression on a day when I was looking to grab a coffee and pastry.  #namaste"}
{"text":"This is a really cute find in Madison. They have homemade baked goods displayed in a cute homey way. We had the SEC breakfast wrap and it was delicious. The chipotle ranch sauce is good. The latte is good. Environment is country chic with ample seating outside too. Nice place!"}
{"text":"Helbach's is a new coffee house with coffee specialties, a variety of teas, pastries and treats, and also serves breakfast and salads, sandwiches and wraps.  It's on Madison's far West Side behind West Towne.  Their sandwiches are really good with generous sandwich fillings, and come with veggie and dip, so they care about our health!  This is a locally-owned family business: Mom, Dad and young adult kids.  They're super nice.  We'll be steady customers, especially my husband, who needs his lunch sandwich every day."}
{"text":"Great place to meet someone for coffee! A variety of seating... great outdoor area, weather permitting. A small, but delicious variety of breakfast and lunch items and the BEST pecan sticky buns in town...made by the owner."}
{"text":"We have been to 100's of cafes over the years, this is a gem: from the bold, flavorful coffee, to the made from scratch baked goods, to the lively, energetic staff. Also, very tidy and clean. I hadn't eaten yet when I stopped in,was surprised to find an option for a healthy breakfast and lunch. I had their SEC (grilled breakfast wrap served with a homemade yogurt based chipotle sauce) Delicious. My son had a hearty soup. It was fantastic.  It is great to have a local cafe on the west side of Madison."}
{"text":"Great coffee & very cute atmosphere. I love that it's family owned and everyone I've met behind the counter is nothing short of friendly. I'd like to add that it's very loud and not the ideal work place, much more of a social location."}
{"text":"Only got coffee, as I was in a rush.  But they did a phenomenal job, and it was one of the best caramel coffee beverages I have had.  The interior is a very interesting design, and I like the concept that they have naming the drinks after trips the family has taken."}
{"text":"To Ryan B's review, my partner and I had been going to Helbach's for about a year and have found them to nothing but friendly and accepting people/ family. They have the best coffee and Granola bars in the city. I highly recommend this coffee shop for everyone."}
{"text":"I love the vibe, decor, and presentation. The coffee however is not very pleasant :( The menu and staff are delightful! I sure wish they used real plates and utensils..or at least stir sticks. I hate wasting a plastic spoon for a simple stir. I enjoy that they offer maple syrup for alternative sweetner. I am sad to say they have no gluten free bread. Their trail mix bars are amazing! The avocado smash with bacon was incredible I hear, although, they were out of arugula when it was on their specials board. Having a real knife, real plate, and arugula would have made it a 5 star sandwich! The environment is one of my favs! I am very sad that I dont enjoy the coffee."}
{"text":"Great place to come to! Comfy, cosy, warm ambience, great food and coffee! Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So the drive thru automatically charged $0.86 tip for $3 coffee without my permission (I did not ask for the receipt, the tip shows up on the email receipt afterwards). $3 is already expensive for medium size drip coffee IMO. I don't know any other coffee shop that does this. I'll update the review if the tip is taken off when the bill is finalized."}
{"text":"This is a very easy to miss coffee house, but don't let that fool you. The interior is very cozy, and for lack of a better word, quaint. They hanging lamps with mason jar lamp shades (that's not a lamp shade style, they actually have bottle green mason jars over the lights) are a really nice touch. They have a faux fireplace, and nice cushy chairs placed artfully around it. Speaking of art, they have stools with hand-painted city scenes on the seat, such as the Eiffel Tower with Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" in the background. They croissants are really well done, but just don't order the chocolate chip cookie. I love a soft cookie, but these mush piles were a sin. I couldn't even finish mine and got nauseated later.  Aside from that low point, everything else was near perfect. They have a large selection of bakery goods, which were nice and fresh, nothing seemed stale.  I got the liquid gold hot chocolate, which scrumptious, and it even came with a mini Snickerdoodle on the lid! They also have a drive thru, which was very surprising given the old-fashion feel of the place."}
{"text":"First time here. Had a great rating on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. Service was excellent, food was delicious. Husband had the SEC and I had the Fetish breakfast sandwich.  Perfect portions. Coffee was very good. Love the quaint atmosphere and all the locals."}
{"text":"I am so thankful that this place opened because I work right up the street. Although I've only gotten my items to go at this point it has a very warm and inviting feel to it! Both times I've been I've given in to my temptations and ordered bakery items. (They look too good not to!) I love when things are homemade and these items are. They do not disappoint! I can't wait to try their lunch items. It is a family run shop and when I say that, I mean it. Both times the kids have been there helping! I think it is wonderful."}
{"text":"They have wonderful baked goods made on premises.  My cookie was warm out of the oven yesterday.  Everything I have eaten here has been excellent.  I think many agree with me.  Every time I visit almost every table is full."}
{"text":"While it is easy to distract this dog with squirrels, a squirrel worth writing for is really a rare event. This family owned coffee shop is that squirrel, leading to my first writing a review that isn't for a restaurant.  Helbach's coffee shop is one that has been around for over a year now. I stop by every once in a while and consistently leave satisfied. There is both a walk in option and drive through option - very rare and notably convenient. In the first time walking in, I immediately noticed a cozy and up scale look.  The menu, obviously, offers coffee and espresso options alongside baked goods, hot breakfast, and other food options. Drive through service always starts off with a smile.  Additionally, service is consistently polite and prompt. What is also consistent is high quality coffee and orders that are made with special requests. I have an allergy to some of the syrup coffee flavorings and just a simple communication has led to consistent observation of my allergy. Really I think making an item to specific request, alongside the freshness, says a lot about what this business it.  I've written a lot of Yelp reviews, but, none for a coffee shop. I write this happily and thoughtful of how good Helbachs is. If you are looking for a quick stop for a good cup of coffee, or a place to hang out for an hour or two, this is it."}
{"text":"Disappointing on multiple fronts, especially the quality of food and coffee.  The ambiance of this coffee shop is nice, and we were excited to get brunch here.  We ordered an omelette sandwich, an avocado toast, a granola, a coffee and a latte.  The toast and granola were decent, but the sandwich were almost inedible. The latte was subpar, and my boyfriend couldn't even drink the coffee since it was so bitter and poorly made.    Overall, a disappointing brunch."}
{"text":"This place is beyond adorable and I'm mad that I've lived in Madison for a year and a half and I'm just now finding it. It is really cozy, and the fireplace makes it feel like home. It does get busy quickly though, and that can elevate the noise level to be too high for studying or quiet work. This is a great place to meet friends and chat, though. My favorite drink here is the London fog, but I haven't found anything I don't like. I recently ordered the SEC breakfast wrap. It was MASSIVE and delish! The special sauce is truly special...I would go back just for that.  Other than the noise level sometimes, I've noticed there can be a long wait time for your order. Last time I was in I waited about 15 min for my wrap and latte, which I found excessive. There have also been some employees having less than professional conversations right at the counter, so that has turned me off once or twice. If it weren't for that...I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem!  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I met up with a friend who fell in love with this place recently.  She really couldn't have been more right about Helbachs.  I have driven by it before and have always been intrigued by the plastic bubble house on their front patio, which you can sit in and enjoy.  When the weather is better, I will definitely make use of it.  The shop itself is pretty small, but that gives it a very cozy, warm, comforting feel.  I especially love the variety of seating, from 2 top wooden tables, to a large wooden table for groups, to the arm chairs and love seat sitting in front of the fireplace.    The wooden stools are beautifully painted and really captured my eye.  The menu is short and sweet, which makes it easier to decide what you'd like for those who struggle with indecision as I do.  They offer your basic coffee drinks, shakes (they call them shakas), and a few unique drink options.  Additionally, they have a food menu, which includes some typical breakfast pastries, as well as breakfast sandwiches.    The service was quick and friendly!    Pricewise, I'd say they're pretty comparable to Starbucks (but, again, I'm not a coffee aficionado).  I highly recommend taking the extra time to stop over here and give it a try sometime!  This will probably be my new go-to coffee stop when friends want to get together."}
{"text":"Stopped in on an impulse this morning and was very glad I did! I had not been to this spot since it was a Victor Allens and couldn't believe it when I walked in, this place is absolutely adorable. I wish I hadn't been on my way to work cause I could have sat here all day. The decor and atmosphere are wonderful. They also have a drive-thru if you are looking for something quick! The staff was also friendly and I enjoy that it is locally owned. There is a nice selection of both baked goods and breakfast and lunch sandwiches, and of course a variety of different drinks. I ordered the Beam'r sandwich to-go and it was delicious. Sandwiches are all made to-order and it was surprising and refreshing to be able to eat a breakfast sandwich that didn't include a microwaved egg!  I am excited to return to try some other menu items and spend more time inside. I definitely recommend anybody try this spot out!"}
{"text":"Prices are a little more expensive but in a cozy atmosphere, friendly customer service and good food, it is worth the price."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in weeks!  Very friendly staff and unique atmosphere delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Great comfy atmosphere, friendly people, delicious coffee and homemade baked goods. It's a really nice place to come and work, or have a cup of coffee and relax into your thoughts.  Either way, I recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't have much time to be able to hang out in a coffee shop, but when I do this is the one I pick. It won me over when it first opened and I went through the drive through for a coffee, and they gave me a warm chocolate chip cookie just for grins. That's the cozy, friendly vibe you still get when you walk in. The owners and staff appear to inspire patrons to share space when it gets crowded, and work together to make room. Soecialty drinks and baked goods alike are tempting.  Today I ate here, and tried the deluxe avocado \"smash\" with arugula and bacon on top of a multigrain toast. The description referenced an avocado smashed with garlic and lemon and whatnot, but it appeared to be a little packet of shelf-stable guacamole. That said, it was a tasty snack. My mocha was just a tad on the cool side, but it was a super busy afternoon.  I couldn't stop gazing longingly at the sweet little solarium tent they had set up outside on the beautiful 50 degree sunny January day - those folks with their eyes closed, coffee close at hand and faces turned to the sun won the day. Well done, Helbachs!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and I love it!  Great atmosphere, food and coffee. Plus they have a drive through!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"5/5 stars for the ambiance, 5/5 for the customer service, 4/5 for the java.  I was greeted by a nice young man who asked if it was my first time there. I told him that it was indeed my first visit, and he gave beverage recommendations which were very welcomed. I chose a classic vanilla latte... but it seemed more like a cappuccino with the amount of foam. The overall taste was good, but not great. It was just a \"meh\" drink.  I would return again but try something else.  Bonus: They have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because I was in need of some serious coffee and a light breakfast. I was very impressed with the atmosphere of Helbachs and their charm. To be very honest, I overheard some owners talking & was happy to hear their constant motivation/drive to keep making this cute coffee house even better as the seasons change!  Definitely a must if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"It's best to enjoy this family-run coffee house on a lazy weekend morning, but the convenient drive thru window means getting a delicious latte with complimentary sliver of scone before work is quick and easy. Their breakfast menu is to die for, especially the avocado smash and the gluten free granola."}
{"text":"Great interior decor!  The London Fog latte that I had was tasty.  Enjoyed the presentation of all of the baked goods.  Overall a cozy, quiet place to enjoy a warm beverage."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, and clearly a \"local favorite\" however in the 4 times I've been here it takes 10+ minutes to be served at the counter as the staff seems to have an island speed of life and always seems (almost neglecting) preoccupied.    On my first trip I chalked it up to them being busy, the second trip I was a bit dumbfounded at how slow it was, and on the third and fourth trips decided this just isn't my coffee spot.    Seems like a nice club of locals but the speed of service and high priced food and beverage items didn't resonate with me.  And I'm usually a fan premium coffee, pastries, and breakfast foods.   Likes:  Ambience, decor, outdoor seating  Dislikes:  Prices, slow speed of service, limited seating"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this is a coffee shop, it should be Hellbach's Cafe - I thought the coffee options were rather limited. Their food menu was far more elaborate! Semantics aside, I ordered an ice mocha and it was comparable to Starbucks or another chain coffee shop. I found the rest of the coffee options to be 'standard' - a shop for those that don't need a fancy coffee.  The decor was an assortment of furniture and the paint on the wood paneling at the order counter seemed like a rushed after thought. Like it was the first D.I.Y. project the employees tried for a team building exercise.  I think Victor Allen's was here before and I'm not sure if this new tenant's coffee stands out enough to last longer than the previous owners. Time will tell."}
{"text":"It's great to see a new coffee shop in this area! The staff was very friendly and eager to explain the day's pastries, and they were great about customizing my drink. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"this place has a great vibe. i love how cozy and hip it feels at the same time. my house-made granola with almond milk was yummy and my husband said his egg, cheese,  and bacon breakfast sandwich was delicious. i also got the karme latte and my husband got the mocha. i thought it was strange that they only do one size on the espresso drinks but i can see why considering the cute mugs they use. the only caveat is the menu is very limited and it doesn't say that soy or almond milk is available even though they offer both. it'd be nice to see those options listed on the menu."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! Convenient location, and once you're inside it's easy to escape the hustle and bustle outside thanks to the comfy chairs and big tables. My chai was spicy and delicious, priced as I would expect at a local shop. Nice decor and soundtrack, friendly barista. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Look how cute this new little coffee house is! It's not intended to have 5,000 things on the menu, but what it does have, it does well. My London Fog was perfect. I could imagine spending hours in this relaxing little coffee house writing a novel or catching up with a friend."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a different coffee shop ever since the Starbucks in Greenway  built their new store, which we don't care for. We found it! Love to visit in the summer and relax on their patio. The coffee is very good. The service is a bit slower than Starbucks but that's 0k. They have a drive through but haven't tried it. Once you order your coffee they will bring it to your table if you ask them. Very relaxing and cute place."}
{"text":"Warm, friendly and kind service. Everything is DELICIOUS. We are delighted to have discovered you! Breakfast sandwiches are humungous  and savory and the sweets are scrumptious."}
{"text":"Lovely shop in a small space. Seating inside is well utilized, with a fireplace making it cozy. There is a heated dome tent with cushioned seating outside. The drink menu is small but unique; I tried a Karma Macchiato. The baked goods look and taste amazing. The baked granola is excellent."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite coffee shops. Friendly, comfortable and great coffee.  The food is wonderful too."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little coffee house. The coffee is really good.  My friend and I agreed that our lattes were the best.  It is quite small so I would think that on a really busy day, it might be quite crowded in there.  I have recommended this place to others that are looking for a quaint coffee shop.  The food is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Very good coffees and excellent breakfast pastry goodies.  I wish they opened earlier..Especially in light of no Starbucks in the area at the moment."}
{"text":"Been wanting to hit this place up for soooo long! Finally got over here and glad I did. Thumbs up for excellent service and a very knowledgeable barista!"}
{"text":"Their coffee and friendliness would get a 5, but having to wait half an hour for food and then having to ask about it only to find out they lost my order and no longer have all components is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for coffee salad, pastries or sandwiches. Excellent chicken salad and my son had their phenomenal grilled PB&J. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this coffee shop! The staff is wonderful, the food is amazing and the coffee is delicious. I stopped in earlier this week and made two separate purchases from two different people -- and when I can in today both of them remembered my allergies without having to be reminded. After only one previous visit I felt like I was a regular. I'll be spending as much time as possible here before I move in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Big on desserts, just wanted coffee. They had opening problems with orders,  they are new,  if they can fix those issues,  and get some healthy choices they will be good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and was not impressed with the service, coffee, or prices. The decor is cute, but on one of my visits it was extraordinarily hot in the winter with the fire going, and on another visit it was very crowded, so I'm not sure it's a great place to sit and work."}
{"text":"Friendly, cute, locally owned coffee shop. The baristas are knowledgeable and helpful, and the food is great too! Great spot tucked away from the hassles of life. Try the granola."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable coffee shop. And locally owned to boot! It's tucked behind KFC and across from Pier One. It's a bit hidden and while I drive past quite often, I'm not sure I would have ever noticed it except for the Yelp reviews that kept rolling in.  The decor is very cute. Don't miss the Mason jar lamps-very cute touch. It feels like it should be in Door County or somewhere vacationy like that.   The breakfast sandwiches were enormous and served on a most excellent Madison Sourdough brioche (it actually tasted more like a croissant. Score!). Everything tasted surprisingly fresh.  There is always a wide assortment of baked goods. The cranberry coffeecake was delicious.   They offer the standard coffeehouse drinks. Their chai is on the spicier side which I really enjoy. The liquid gold hot chocolate is house made and can be made \"dirty\" with a shot or two of espresso. The liquid gold lives up to its name :) And it's served with a mini chocolate chip cookie on top of the cup. Hooray!  Wifi code is listed on the board to the left behind the bakery case."}
{"text":"Was looking for some good food on new years day and was pleasantly surprised to see that they were open.  First visit and very glad I did.  It's a quaint little place with a great atmosphere.   Got the SEC breakfast sandwich and damn was it good! Super hot, quality ingredients, and came with a yummy sauce.  At $8 it's a little pricy but really for the quality it's a great value.  They also make a mean cappuccino. Super quality beans; velvety and chocolate notes.  They also do the fancy heart pour.  Hands down the best coffee I've had in Madison yet.   On top of all that the service was genuinely friendly, no fake smiles here.   Will definitely come back and try some of their other sandwiches, which look great."}
{"text":"They are always very nice, always professional, and the coffee is always very good. If you go inside, it's warm and friendly and they have a fireplace. Great place to have a conversation, read or write. Absolutely one of my favorite places in Madison."}
{"text":"Love finding a family owned business! The ambiance is simply stunning. Stopped in for breakfast and enjoyed a breakfast sandwich and a latte... And it was fabulous. Family owned beats chain any day."}
{"text":"No seating available because the place was full of individuals working on their computers. Also the coffee was TERRIBLE. The baristas were not friendly at all. The best thing about this place was the decor. But for a coffee shop that really is a low priority."}
{"text":"Excellent little coffee shop on the West side. Liquid Gold Hot Chocolate was amazingly rich, and the House Blend had a nice smooth taste."}
{"text":"Really good coffee with a bowl of Millet and yogurt. Great location and atmosphere, definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"Day 5 visiting WI, we stop in Madison and are trying to find a cute breakfast house in the area that's open on Memorial Day, and we weren't disappointed.  The atmosphere was soooo adorable, nice and cozy, I would totally love to sit here all day and read or do homework. The baked pastries were mouthwatering and they had so many choices for drinks.  My mom ordered the dirty hot chocolate, and the breakfast sandwich and I ordered a very basic French vanilla latte and the avocado toast, and we got the bourbon sticky bun to share, because honestly, it looked amazing and we couldn't pass it up.  The sticky bun was really nice, but a bit dry. The bourbon glaze really helped it out, but I'm sure they're fantastic if they were straight out of the oven. The Dirty got chocolate was really great, not super sweet, and just enough chocolate to not come across so strong. I personally don't like super sweet hot chocolate, and this was perfect. My latte was great, FV is really my go to and I wasn't at all let down. The toast was an amazing 9 grain toast with thick crust, and the added bacon on top really made it. The ceramic mugs were so adorable I couldn't resist buying one to bring home as a souvenir from WI."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this coffee shop!  Family-owned and just a great place to grab a quick cup, chill, meet up with friends, work, but hopefully you have time to sit and enjoy one of their menu items.    I remember during their soft opening, sipping my perfectly crafted latte working on a boring project, and overheard a young guy (customer) saying to his buddy working there.....\"this sandwich is killer, I could eat this everyday\" and he responded \"yea, we tried, tried, tried again to get grama's recipe right, and I think we nailed it.\"    Well, that was it, I had to find out the name of that sandwich not only bc of the unsolicited 'damn, this is good' but bc of the obvious passion this family has about each item on their menu.   I've also tried to perfect my grama's recipes, bc she's no longer here to coach me, and it's so incredible when you do!   It's the Patagonian Beef in case your wondering, and it's like no sandwich you've ever had....their grama was one bad ass lady!!!     You might have to wait an extra minute or 2, but I will tell you it's SO worth it to get that sandwich made just for you, and will give you time to read the back of the menu and learn about this amazing family's story.    Love to hear about surf competitions whilst in a WI coffee shop!!      The SEC is so flipping noteworthy also, my fiance won't order anything else....I tried replicating at home, FAIL.    Go there, get it, and then go back bc ya gonna be craving it!"}
{"text":"Cutest little family coffeeshop I've been to. The atmosphere is rustic with varying instrumental music playing in the background (since my stay I've heard genres from jazz to Harry Potter). The owner always seem to strike up conversation with everyone that comes in. They also have a drive thru which is a HUGE plus for those that just want a quick local coffee fix. They make most of their baked goods in house and I've heard great things about their food. This is a great place to catch up with an old friend over coffee or to enjoy a quick lunch by yourself. Place is a tad small for bigger groups (~4) but there's nice outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"I'm creating a review because there is no other way to respond to a review, by Heidi below. You took up space there for an entire day, used their wi-fi for an entire day, had numerous coffee drinks at a coffee house that you label as delicious, and then give a crappy review that appears in very large part to not liking the music and you didn't even ask them to change it? Ok, legitimate complaint (perhaps) about the turkey in the sandwich you asked them to destroy for your preferences, but seriously.... Get a home office where you can eat whatever you want while listening to whatever you want."}
{"text":"So... Coffee to go with a miniature cookie on top, blood-mary mustard that makes my heart stop, décor that makes me feel right at home with super tasty breakfast sandwiches as big as a small garden gnome.  Well I tried, but it does sum up a great experience."}
{"text":"This coffee shop already gets extra points for being open on Sundays! A rare find on the west side of Madison. Their coffee drinks are delicious (nothing out-of-the-ordinary, though) and I've been meaning to try their food because every time I go in my mouth starts to water just reading the menu.   The inside space is a bit cramped and it can be hard to find adequate seating sometimes. With that being said, I've never gone there and been left standing. They have this really neat gazebo/snow globe-y structure out front that is a plastic-covered seating area and it has a space heater for chilly days. That can be a nice place to sit if you're wanting to be outside - even when it's raining!"}
{"text":"Helbach's is a cozy, rustic little place, conveniently located just west of West Towne mall, which offers specialty coffees and light fare for breakfast and lunch. I love the layout, the seating and decor, and especially the nice fireplace in the corner with comfy seating. The first time I was here was for a personal meeting, and I only took advantage of the coffee. Regular coffee to drink \"in\" comes in a nice sized mug and runs you around $3.00 and some change.WIFI of course is available. The coffee met my \"will put hair on your chest\" requirement. No weakling coffee for me.The baked goods and other offerings looked good, and I will need to come back for those. One of the nicest \"indie\" coffee spots I've seen."}
{"text":"Great food & even better bakery! What a wonderful staff they have as well. I've never left disappointed with anything they have to offer. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review with, I really wanted to like Helbach's but two issues occured that may keep me from coming back.  I went to Helbach's for the first time the other day as I was looking for a quiet place to hang out grading for the day, as our street is being repaired and the constant beeping of machines meant I couldn't think straight home. My requirements were simple: coffee and lunch choices, comfortable chairs, and free WiFi.  Helbach's delivered the WiFi and the comfortable chairs in spades. The interior is cute and there are a variety of seating options--two-top tables, a large meeting table where ten could sit comfortably, two over-stuffed chairs and a couch, and outdoor seating. While there is only a plug or two to plug in if one's computer needs to be charged, but that's not a huge problem if one goes with a fully charged computer. There's also WiFi; I didn't try to see if it worked outside, but inside, it was great.   The two coffee drinks I had were well made and tasted good. Both were de-caf lattes with skim milk. The first one was iced and it was very good. I don't need a lot of flavor or other fancy things, but I like coffee a lot and these fit the bill. The cost is $4.00. It's a tiny bit more than a place like Starbucks, but I like supporting a local business, so this is not a problem for me.   At lunch, I ordered the Bavarian sandwich (turkey, pastrami, and ham with cheese). I asked to not have pastrami or ham, as I don't eat red meat. I also asked to have no condiments on the sandwich, but mustard on the side. They made the sandwich to my specifications, which was great. It was served with some baby carrots and a kind of cucumber raita for the carrots.  While the carrots and dressing were a nice touch and good, my sandwich was not. While they did, as I saw above, prepare the sandwich to my specifications, the turkey was not good. I think it was supposed to be fresh and over roasted, but it had been over roasted, I think, by a good deal. It had a dried grisly texture that was not very good. They did remake the sandwich, but the turkey was still the problem. I had a hard time getting that taste out of my mouth. Later, I order another latte and cookie, and the young man comped my cookie, which was very nice--and that helped with the annoying after taste, but that is still a problem in that I'm not sure they should've been serving that to begin with.  Every business deserves a bad day and maybe the sandwich was their's, but the second issue was more problematic for me, though, I may be in the minority here. The problem was the music they played while I was there. I don't mind music in a coffee place, per se, if it doesn't overpower the conversations I'm having or the thinking I need to be doing, and for a while, I was able to ignore theirs, but after awhile, I noticed that the \"easy listening\" they were streaming was actually soft Christian rock. Like Ringo Starr, \"I don't subscribe\" to this religion. The young man who had been working there all the time I was there told me what sort of station it was and asked if I liked it. I wasn't rude, but I was firm; no, I said, I don't. It is not my thing. Perhaps I could've asked for him to turn to a different station or turn it off. I certainly had earned a little right to ask since I not only spent a good deal of time there, but I had also made sure that I spent more than a few bucks there as well. At the same time, I don't think money should equal influence, so I didn't ask him to change the station. Still I tend to stay away from businesses that have a particular sort of worldview, but do not admit or even think that that view is narrowed. This might not bother others, but it bothered me, and for that reason, I will probably be looking for a different place to grade papers or write when I don't want to be at home."}
{"text":"Great coffee and customer service but homophobia is the disease of this Country and shouldn't be mixed in with a pleasurable thing such as coffee."}
{"text":"For five whole months I had been walking around Madison, Wisconsin, thinking that I had been to every independent coffee shop in the city. I told my friends. I told my friends' friends. It was a big deal. Little did I know that not only had I missed a shop, but seemingly the most important independent hub for coffee drinkers on the west side of the city.  Helbachs Coffee House is one of the few, the proud, independent coffee shops on the west side of Madison.    A family venture from the start, founder of the \"Jesus Lunch\" gatherings at Middleton High School Melissa always wanted to open a small café with her children and husband for the months when they were not travelling the world as a unit.  Just over a year ago, her dream came true.   Located in a former Victor Allen's Coffee, The Helbachs space perfectly embodies what it means to be \"rustic chic\" in the age of Pinterest. Intimidate without being intimidating, it seemed on-brand that the table next to me was a conversation between a wedding photographer and soon-to-be bride.  We are talking strategically stained wood, hand-drawn flowers and quotes like \"Dream big\" written in cursive on pillows.   Whether you are studying alone or part of a squad, Helbachs is small but mighty. Indoors there is a community table with high-top cushion chairs that comfortably sits eight people.   Surrounding are around seven tables for parties of two to four. If you are looking for a more comfortable spot, there is a couch with two loveseats situated around their fireplace. In a rare occurrence, this particular shop seems to be able to sit more people outdoors than inside. Take a seat at one of their umbrella-covered tables or in a wicker loveseat. Your group of five will be easily accommodated.   Courtesy of Just Coffee, there is a special Helbachs House Blend (medium-dark blend) as well as a unique light roast, but the real winner is their food menu. It is a rarity for coffeehouses to make every aspect of their sandwiches in-house and to-order, but that is exactly what Helbachs does. For example, I ordered their SEC (grilled wrap with bacon, egg, cheddar, crispy hashbowned potatoes, \"Special Sauce\"). I personally watched every step of the wrap get made from scratch, and the extra attention mattered. Further, the woman in front of me ordered over $70 worth of baked goods and then declared that the pecan rolls were \"legendary\".   There is no doubt in my mind that Helbachs Coffee House will continue to be successful amongst west side locals, but I am curious about what happens during the spring months when the family takes their extended sabbaticals (for example, they just went to Asia for an extended period of time). With each child having a title like Marketing Director and/or Head Barista, does the shop close? This is me being selfish and a west side native.   Regardless, between their family adventures and within business hours, make sure to stop by. Helbachs Coffee House is in my Top 15 of Madison, for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, drinks and food! Highly recommend. Drive-through is an awesome perk as well!"}
{"text":"A cute, quiet place to work with benches/pillows instead of chairs. An outside seating area is also open during the summer. There are \"secret\" extension cords under the benches for laptop power. Also, the peppermint iced tea was refreshing and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The adorable space (cozy, warm and inviting) bumps this place up to 3 stars.  I've been here twice now and neither visit has been overly impressive.  First visit I had tried one of their tea lattes and it arrived lukewarm.  My second visit I tried a light roast and a pb chocolate cookie bar - coffee was very acidic and the bar was obviously tasty.  Their drink prices seem a touch high to me and while all the treats in their bakery case look tasty, there are no descriptions or prices listed, so you either have to ask or just guess.  And I agree with a previous review on the speed of the service - slooww!  Their 'baristas' are pretty young and maybe a bit inexperienced.  Both of my visits were during the day, so I'm not sure how speedy they are during the morning rush, but they also don't open until 7am on weekdays.  This area of Madison needs some more coffee house options, so they've got that going for them."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a relaxed, easy breakfast and discovered Helbachs Coffee House. Helbachs is the best coffee house I've found in Madison. It has a cute interior with friendly service. The SEC breakfast wrap is amazing! To end the meal, they completely won me over with their chocolate chip cookie, which they warmed up for me. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, great selection of treats, courteous service. I like what they've done with the interior - sort of a rustic traditional vibe. There's a drive through if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great coffee house. We had a chai, mocha and delicious breakfast sandwiches. Cozy interior, friendly service. We loved that it wasn't chilly or noisy!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, coffee and food. I love the vibe in this little coffee shop. The Bourbon Bun is a MUST, everything is made from scratch and with love!"}
{"text":"Perfect way to spend an anti typical spring day away from home.  This place evokes all that a quintessential coffee shop of bygone times mixed with a sense of permanence in the present setting.  Love their choices.  The quality is 5 Star."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get an iced espresso, and I paid almost $5 for three shots.  Thought it would be the best espresso I've ever had and it didn't hold up to EVP or even, sadly, Starbucks (where the same is around $3 at each place).  The three shots filled up about an inch of the cup (with ice!!!), where EVP and Bux fill up around 3 inches.  I found this rather hilarious and ridiculous.  I even verified with the person who made it that it did indeed contain three shots.   The people working were pleasant and the decor is pretty, but I will never go back and I won't recommend.  I was so sad about this experience that I would have rather just gone without caffeine at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee house in the Madison area. And I would consider trying new coffee shops a hobby of mine. The coffee is great and the ambiance is calm and relaxing. They have a small selection of baked goods which are fresh and tasty. I highly recommend Helbachs."}
{"text":"The owner of Helbach's did a fabulous job of updating the old Victor Allen's space on D'Onfrio Drive.  By using repurposed wood and employing a blue and brown color scheme, they have given the location a rustic chic vibe, which was reinforced by the soft jazz playing in the back ground.  There is plenty of plenty of seating options, including a group of comfy chairs around a fireplace.  There also is a pleasant patio with outdoor seating. The Wi-Fi signal was strong and steady, despite a large lunch crowd when I visited. There also is a drive through window for those of you coffee achievers requiring caffeine on the go.  Helbach's offers the usual arsenal of coffee drinks, as well as teas and smoothies.  There is a display filled with a tempting variety of homemade pastries.  There is a small breakfast menu and a variety of sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I tried the Patagonia Beef sandwich and absolutely loved it.   It was both well designed and superbly executed - the roast beef was hot, tender and juicy and the homemade chimichurri sauce subtly boosted the ensemble's flavor.  Every great sammie needs a steller bread component and the grilled ciabatta from Madison Sourdough did not disappoint.   The lightly dressed greens on the sandwich would have benefited from being served as a side salad, as the heat from the beef turned them into mush by the time I consumed the second half of my sandwich.  While the sandwich was on the smaller side, I felt it was a solid value at $8.50, given the quality of the ingredients.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I received my sandwich about ten minutes from the time I ordered.  While no own checked in after I received my food, I was thanked for coming in as I departed.    In an area dominated by chain restaurants, Helbach's provides an oasis of homemade deliciousness.  I'm certainly looking forward to exploring more of the sandwich menu as well as enjoying some time on their patio this summer."}
{"text":"Just tried breakfast sandwiches this am and they were VERY delicious!!!! Perfectly crispy bacon!!! Ordered coffee twice now and its been fantastic both times!!! I HATE overly sugary/sweet coffee drinks and these are a perfect balance of coffee and sweetness!! Hubby and i will have to make this a regular place!! Great locally owned place!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. We live very close and have the chance to go there pretty often so it has more or less become our \"Coffeehouse spot\" to hang out and do work. While there, we have had alot of different food options as well as their tea selection. My wife and I are not huge coffee drinkers, so we cant be too helpful about this, but the tea selection is actually really good, which is not something you can always get at every coffeehouse. The tea is about $3.50 for a pot of tea with unlimited refills (also something not always offered at coffee shops) The only thing is, dont get it to go. Its one cup for the same price and thats not such a great deal. The ambiance of the place is fun with plenty of seating and plenty of table space for someone to do work there. The one real issue I have with the place is the price. The food is just way too expensive for what you get. Dont get me wrong, everything there is delicious, but I dont like the idea of spending $12 for a Reuben with nothing else but the sandwich. No offense, its just not THAT good. Other than that, though, a great place to go and do work or just hang out and have a nice cup of tea."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop on the West Side for a sit-down experience. To be honest, I really only came here the first time because Yelp told me they had a private parking lot and I needed somewhere to camp out to work on my laptop for the day. This was probably one of the best decisions I could have made (and they do have ample private parking, FYI, which is very rare to find).  Helbach's is unbelievably trendy and homey inside - there are wooden tables, heavy ceramic mugs, plush chairs and couches, and a beautiful display of homemade bakery. As any millennial who is avoiding their responsibilities does, I snapped a quick picture of my coffee and was instantly flooded with questions from friends. (Where is this?!!! How do I get there??? Is this place new?!!!!) Helbach's delivers on decor and ambiance for sure, and that's just the beginning.  This coffee shop is family-owned business and it was really precious to see the younger daughters train and make the bakery from scratch. Everyone is extremely friendly and although it was a little unfamiliar to get service from workers who seemed young, they were eager to help.   As far as coffee and food goes, it was good. Nothing particularly bad, nothing particularly special either though, especially because prices are high. Their house coffee is good and there are free refills. The chai tea latte I once got was just average for me as well, but pretty steep at $6. Bakery is reasonably priced but nothing stood out to me (tried the lemon poppyseed muffin with lemon curd inside, chocolate fudge bar, etc.) The sandwiches are tasty and fresh and would suggest giving them a try!  A few suggestions I have would be to maybe offer 1/2 price bakery through the afternoon on certain things? Since the coffee shop closes at 5, I can't imagine what happens with all of the leftover bakery and this would seem like a more sustainable solution.   This is definitely a place I'll return to mostly for it's calm environment and ambiance for working. Stop by if you're on the West Side and looking for a cozy place to go!"}
{"text":"I've come through Madison a lot recently and stopped here with family for breakfast. Brunch- quality food in a relaxed, friendly environment. It's family owned, and the staff is really friendly. The food is all from scratch and really unique! The SEC sandwich is my favorite, and if I'm feeling indulgent, the bourbon sticky bun is amazing.   Don't plan on dashing in and out if you stop here; since the food is from scratch, relax and enjoy the experience! They do have a drive through, so grabbing coffee would be quick.   Speaking of coffee- they have their own house blend, created from Just coffee. Cool to support local businesses on all fronts.  All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Perhaps they're having an off day, but my coffee is a hot mess. Literally - a hot mess. It was not prepared to order. It's the temperature of liquid hot magma. And it's spilling all over the sides of the cup. When I mentioned the sitch, they took it back only to return a few minutes later with the same cup! At this point, it was so soaked in boiling liquid that the integrity of the cup was compromised. I mentioned the obvious problem and they took it back again. A long while later, I was wordlessly given another cup of coffee that was not prepared to order and definitely burned. It was, however, in a clean cup, so they've got that going for them. I buy coffee every day of my life and I've never had to deal with a situation like this before. Three tries and I still can't drink this thing! I'm sad because I'd like to support a local coffee shop. I just don't think I can part with another dollar here."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and had their hot chocolate spiked with espresso. Super rich but super delicious. Fast service! I will be back."}
{"text":"Lovely! Family-run, homemade food, quiet setting.  My new favorite Saturday morning spot!"}
{"text":"HELBACHS is my favorite coffeehouse in town and I go to coffee houses often. It is run by a great family with handsome high school, college aged, guys and beautiful girls that work there. They are always happy and pay attention to each customer as they order. Your coffee, espresso, lunch is delivered to your table, even if it's outside on their delightful patio. They have a new, clear plastic geodesic dome type sitting space on the patio this winter. Constant, direct sunlight make it a cozy place for you and friends, so is sitting around the fireplace.  Don't forget to zip it up before you go in to order! The mughom makes wonderful bakery goods and if you don't get there early, you will miss out on the deelicious blueberry scones. They also have breakfast sandwiches and lunch sandwiches and soups. I don't know the address but it's west on Mineral Point Road from West Town Mall and left at the light for D'onofrio. You'll see the KFC on the corner. Go and enjoy. The Dirty Hot Chocolate is to die for!"}
{"text":"Helbach's is a great spot for working or relaxing. It's really cute inside -- the tables are reclaimed wood from old bowling alleys!  There's also a great wood art piece in the bathroom!   The family who own the coffee shop are such friendly people. They seem to know how to handle any situation that comes up, and they are willing to answer any menu questions.   I am a tea person and I love the selections here. There are sometimes options that aren't on the menu too, that the staff will tell you about. I like that I can get a teapot that lasts forever while I'm working, or if I come to hang out with someone we can share it! I haven't had a tea I didn't like here.   As far as food, I've had the chicken salad croissant and the Reuben. Both were delicious, although the chicken salad didn't agree with my stomach. The chocolate chip cookies are amazing and also totally shareable, if you're in the mood to, that is! Blueberry muffins for breakfast... yum! I would say the prices are a little high (and I've heard other customers say the same), but that doesn't stop me from coming back because the quality is so high."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my stop here with a friend.  I had the chicken and broccoli Caesar salad.  It was a generously big salad with very fresh ingredients.  It really was big enough for two servings.  My friend got the Reuben .  I got a few bites of that sandwich and it was very good.  I enjoyed the fresh brewed ice tea.  I enjoyed reading the menu and can not wait to explore it some more.    The pastries all looked incredible.  I had something that was a small loaf of a cinnamon like cake.  It was good but I am dreaming about my next visit and getting that sticky bun.  I will update once I get a taste of that."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Fantastic coffee.  I prefer their dark roast, but the light is good too.  The menu is diverse and locally sourced -- and most importantly, DELICIOUS.  Staff is friendly and helpful, and patient.  Drop in for a cup to-go (or even quicker thru the drive-thru window, or stay for a cup, a meal, or longer.  Comfortable, casual, communal, and just plain awesome."}
{"text":"Visiting our son at UW ... incredible breakfast sanwiches - we had the SEC, Beam'r and Ultimate PB&J ... plus a variety of specialty drinks.  All excellent.  Really nice furniture and decorations.  I would go here a lot if I lived locally."}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem! EXCELLENT food and service.  Helbach's is new and located on the West Side, but don't think that means they aren't as trendy or high-quality as our Capitol coffee shops. I seem to have hit a streak of awesome coffee shops in Madison and this one was definitely one of them.  I had seen that they were new on Yelp, so I decided to try them out for lunch on the West side. The first thing that struck me as awesome was the interior of the place (along with the furniture). Helbach's is a family business and the interiors were done by their uncle. While we were there, they were also constructing a garden box out front to compliment the outdoor seating (which was also pretty cozy).  I got the fetish breakfast sandwich and loved it. The eggs were fresh and it came on a Madison Sourdough roll. My friend got the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and also really enjoyed it. To drink, I got the peach roibos iced. Again, quite good.  The location is a bit off the beaten path, it's back behind the West Towne Mall on the road that Pier 1 is on, but totally worth the visit.  I'll definitely be back and passing the word onto my friends. The only complaint I have is that they're not closer to downtown where I live!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop tucked away. I'm so thankful to the friend who recommended this place. The staff are so nice, the food is amazing, and the coffee is smooth. Definitely will be my new coffee shop!!"}
{"text":"We randomly stopped in at this coffee shop while visiting Madison. My husband and I both got iced caramel lattes and it was the BEST iced coffee we ever had! I still can't stop thinking about it! If you are a coffee lover, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is where the old Victor Allen's used to be off of mineral point Rd. Its across from Peir One and next to the KFC. I hope they do some advertising, have customers from the old VA or just plain old word of mouth. This location, to me, isn't the greatest and not very visible from the road.  Upon walking in I noticed the interior is super cozy and they have a big fire place which was very nice. They have a bake case with cookies, sticky buns, and a few other items. They also had some croissants and brioche, which looked like Madison Sourdough brand but I couldn't be sure, I'll make sure to ask next time. They also have other breakfast and lunch items on their menu.  The staff was super friendly. This is definitely a family run place. The young man taking orders was very nice and made a flavored latte just fine and was perfectly hot. I ordered a small which wasn't very small, maybe 16oz? Not sure if that's really their small or it was made larger by accident. Either way that's fine with me. I also ordered a sticky bun with a Bourbon sauce they melt on for you. This was delicious and homemade I can only assume. The sauce was nice as some rolls and sticky buns can be dry. This was not the case with this one.  I will definitely be back to try other food and drinks. I am also excited to have a friendly, local coffee shop to go to. Hopefully others try and tell their friends too! And I am looking forward to enjoying the fire place come fall and winter."}
{"text":"It's a cool coffee shop. It has a concise menu, which works for me, since I'm so indecisive and want everything. I can't remember now the local roastery from which Helbachs gets their beans, but the roastery custom roasts Helbachs beans, so I thought that was pretty neat.  I got a croissant while I was there. I'm pretty sure it's not made in-house, but it was still delicious. No toaster to heat it up though.  My one complaint is that this is not a great place to bring your laptop! There are NO outlets. There was one, but it was by the condiments (not sure if sugar, milk, etc. for coffee counts as condiments, but oh well). It would have been extremely unfortunate if someone tripped over my cord. So... I asked for a to-go cup and left."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of participating in the Wine Tasting Event at Hellbachs Coffee House in Madison, near West Towne Mall, this past Friday night. What a fantastic time we had! The four courses were SO delicious and beautifully paired with #flowerswine! Hellbachs Coffee House is a locally owned, family run business with a welcoming and warm, yet hip vibe. The owners are kind, and extremely accommodating as well as being fantastic cooks (thank you, Melissa)! I truly enjoyed our evening with dear friends (there were 9 of us) and loved the Wine Tasting Event. I highly recommend Hellbachs Coffee House!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Helbach's probably my last, pleasant surroundings,great bakery, my omelette was very good, BUT! I couldn't even swallow the coffee, much to strong, burnt, bitter for my taste! I was looking for a new coffee and place, so tried this but it did not work for! In case your interested I did chose the Lite Roast!"}
{"text":"This place opened where Victor Allen's used to be and glad to have them in the neighborhood! The inside is welcoming and cozy, nice place to spend some time. The coffee is good, but the bakery...oh my, the bakery! Everything is homemade and from what I have tried it is all excellent. They also have breakfast and lunch sandwiches. The people that run it are nice and friendly, hope they make it. Support this local business, you won't be disappointed!  Edited 7/25/16 - I finally decided to order a salad from here as all of the bakery items I have tried have been to die for. I ordered the Broccoli Chicken Caesar for $8.99. Big disappointment. Lots and lots of lettuce, a couple sprigs of broccoli and some chicken. In with the chicken was a large piece of cartilage covered with skin, that I picked out. It was also drenched in dressing. If you order a salad, I would recommend the dressing on the side. I think I will just stick with the bakery items."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, all the staff was extremely helpful and had great attitudes. The cafe itself was beautiful decorated and felt comfy and cozy from the moment we stepped in. The iced coffee was very delicious, and I am usually a picky coffee drinker. Not to mention, their pastries are fantastic! We will definitely be back."}
