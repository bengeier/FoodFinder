{"text":"Love the beef fajitas ! Great service and great ambience.  This is a wonderful place to bring the family too and it's priced perfectly!"}
{"text":"Amazing food we always get beef tacos and tamales with the wife they have great green corn tamales"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that there is no competition in the area. It really would only take a Taco Bell to truly take all of the business away from this establishment."}
{"text":"I hosted a business lunch and all my guests and I left half-eaten food. I eat in many Mexican eateries in Greater Phoenix, and i cannot recall anything as bad as this The chicken was hard, dry and tasteless, and one of my guests had pieces of undercooked chicken. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Pollo Fendido was the best I've had anywhere ever. The sauce was amazing, the chicken was moist, rice was fresh and flavorful. Dinner portion was more than generous. Sometimes I find at Mexican food they serve more rice than actual menu item you ordered. Not here. Burrito was huge. Cheese crisp was incredibly good with different cheeses. I didn't like the salsa, but I'm not a sweet salsa person, I like things with a bit of a kick, and even the hot was a bit too sweet for me. However I didn't take a star off for this, because I love that they give you a salsa trio, and the salsas were better than most. Our service was not the best, but due to the other servers seeming nice, I'll blame it on just this one. Food and drinks came out promptly as did refills on chips. Atmosphere is lovely. Cannot wait to go back in the evening hours to see all the different dining rooms lit and outdoor lighting decorated. Overall amazing food, even cooler location."}
{"text":"Just visiting the area.  Stop by after reading reviews.  It was great, everything.  Even the service."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and margaritas are fabulous! Love the midori margaritas! Chimichanga is a favorite!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant since moving to AZ. The carnitas is AMAZING. You get 3 salsas and deliciously crispy chips when you sit down. The margaritas are strong and you will love your food! Get a gallon of the green salsa, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love eating here, wait staff is great, atmosphere is lively especially when they have live music.  Patio is also amazing to sit on this time of year.  I often order something off the menu and they never have an issue with it.  Also the margaritas are just amazing.  Would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Service is more on the rude side... We found a hair in our water and when we asked the waitress for new water and glasses the she acted upset and inconvenience and did not apologized. The establishment over all is dirty. The food was good, not good enough to come back."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but this place is not good.  The roasted jalapeño rellenos were terrible.  The Pollo Fundido is supposedly one of the more popular dishes, but was very bland.  The trio of salsas and chips they provide were ok, but nothing special.  The wait staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"El Encanto DOS has proven that Ugly Sisters aren't only found in fairy tales and pantomimes.    Where to begin my yelp!?  Cobwebs around the window over our table, food served wrapped in tacky tinfoal, dried out limes, missing important ingredients on the fish tacos (pesto fish tacos with forgotten pesto) it was all rather blah.    We had read positive reviews on the original El Encantos in Cave Creek and it wasn't until we arrived that we found we had accidently asked The Ugly Sister out on our date.  Ugh, we couldn't get away fast enough..."}
{"text":"I love the food at El Encanto. As a native Phoenician, I'm picky about my Mexican food and it's rare to have a meal here that's less than awesome. That being said, be prepared for terrible service. I'm sorry to say it, but they have zero interest in providing good service - especially for To Go orders. I have waited on hold calling in for over 10 minutes and realized they forgot about me, they almost always get my order wrong, and they just don't care if you have to wait. So go to El Encanto, double check your order, and just know the service will be bad and have a margarita."}
{"text":"Came here with a crew of 5 adults and 4 small children. This was early on a saturday evening and the restaurant was not crowded. We were told that we would have a 40 min wait!! I looked around and saw tons of open tables. They said that they did not have another server so they were limited to tables. I couldnt grasp that answer so I asked to see the manager. 5 min later we had a table. Was kinda amazed by that whole ordeal.  The food was good and the beer was cold. Ambiance was ok but still couldnt get past the initial seating ordeal. Prices were slightly high considering we were in a \"remote\" area but not too bad."}
{"text":"It's a shame I have to rate this place so low. The food is great but the service is horrible. We have come 3 times and each time we have horrible service.   Tonight's service was the straw that broke the camels back!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to take the family for a great meal. It's located right off of Carefree Highway and has great views all around. It's a very spacial restaurant as well with a great Mexican ambience. Food was absolutely phenomenal, and the service was solid. Great work El Encanto Dos!!"}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors! Love the staff and the management (with one exception) and go at least weekly!! The food is great, and we love having servers who remember the little details. Thanks Tiffany, Natalie and Rikki!!"}
{"text":"Try the polo fundido. Outside dining is great. Beautiful views."}
{"text":"Horrible meal tonight!!!  Food came cold, flowers on table dead, place not clean (food on floor), \"crispy\" fish taco soggy not edible...won't return and won't take all those 100 visiting relatives here either!!  Ice water was good = 1 star!! (Didn't have a choice for zero stars!!)"}
{"text":"The food here was just fine, average American Mexican food. The frozen margaritas also were fine, although they were from a machine.  The service, however, was subpar. Our waitress was so so rude.  She never introduced herself, never said hello, and never smiled.  She came over twice and just basically said \"what do you want to order\" without any pleasantries at all.  Later she swept by and asked how is your food, very perfunctorily and didn't wait for an answer.  She just acted like we were inconveniencing her.  She grabbed check a minute after she brought it back and was annoyed that it hadn't been signed yet.  Then she began cleaning the bar and turned out the lights out while we - and another table - were still there."}
{"text":"Great location, but the food is not the same quality as the original El Encanto in Cave Creek . The bar area is ok."}
{"text":"I had heard so many things about this restaurant since we moved to this side of town, honestly, I could never go back and be perfectly happy.  We both had fajitas and the veggies were raw and the amount of meat was silly, maybe half a chicken breast at most.  Typically they come out sizzling, here not so much.  The server acted like she would rather have been anywhere else and was annoyed to be there."}
{"text":"Sorry the hostess was rude.  Got there at 4 pm.  Not busy at all.  Waited for someone to come out and greet us.  Took 5 minutes.  Took us to a table and I asked for a booth.  She said sorry they are reserved.  I looked only one had a sign on it the other ones did not.  I said okay I will wait for a booth.  Waited 10 minutes then left.  The food their isn't worth it.  If you really want a Great Pollo Fundido go to Carlos O'Brien.  17 and Happy Valley."}
{"text":"Great food. One of our favorite places for Mexican food. We usually drive 30 mins out of our way to eat here. :)"}
{"text":"Love it. The prices are decent, staff is friendly, if mistakes are made all is corrected in a friendly and timely manner. To go orders are handled well, and the food is still hot by the time I complete the 6+ mile drive home.  The pollo fundido is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  The food is always consistently good. The service is great and the management stops by every table every time we are here.  We always start with a cheese crisp and the Queso Guillermo . Fantastic.  Great chips and salsas.  As with many Mexican restaurants, the dinners are over filling.  Always served hot and flavorful.  The Pollo Fundido, chicken chimi with jalapeno cheese sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Changing the menu and then charging for this and that is getting out of hand!! I wanted to order a chimichanga at  El Encanto Dos, a Mexican restaurant, IMAGINE THAT!! But it is now called a Plato Burrito Dinner and apparently only comes with beans and a side of rice.. and.more beans for $10.99!! Okay, this is where it gets tricky, if you order carne asada they also will charge you for shredded beef, so basically another $5.00, (a glitch in the computer from what the manager states).  I'm not finished, don't forget .99 cents for deep frying?!? Do I here nickel and diming!!  They did take $2.00 off for the shredded beef, only when it was brought to the managers attention. The waitress's reply was that how it is the computer!! So, I ask does that make it right, because the computer said so?  The kids menu has a very poor selection.Three kids, two adults equals $100 at El Encanto DOS."}
{"text":"Immediate seating at 630 on Wednesday night.  My wife had the taquitos and I had the carnitas plate.  Both were excellent, service was excellent and the dining room was clean.  We look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Middle of the road. Nothing memorable, nothing especially terrible. Service decent. I don't know, this is not what I'd expect for Mexican food as a tourist coming to Arizona."}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner last Sunday 4/24, despite the menu stating how authentic the food was, we all agreed that it was bland.  Three versions of salsa/hot sauce with the tortilla chips, but even the hot wasn't.  My Carnitas Burro was filled with what appeared to be small cut up pieces of dry pork loin is some sauce, not the moist shoulder that I had expected.  Rice overcooked, a soggy mess, equally flavorless refried beans.  My wife's shrimp tacos were equally disappointing.  We all agreed that we will not go back."}
{"text":"Had my Daughters graduation from NAU/Mothers day dinner. I hate black beans and my dish came with it. I can happily say I will eat thier beans any day! My seafood enchilada was packed. Most places would be skimpy. Service was fast as we had 12 guest. Our party had absolutley no complaints and we all left very happy."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and great food! We shared the appetizer platter and everything was incredible. Offering 3 different salsas with chips... Brilliant. The margarita was delicious and strong. They really knocked it out of the park with the chocolate tamale though."}
{"text":"We have given this place two opportunities within one month to get their act together. Sadly, I took out-of-town guests there tonight and was embarrassed beyond belief. The food is mediocre at best.  The hostess rolled her eyes when I asked that we be seated on a different section of the patio.  Are you kidding?  The pork carnitas was inedible, overcooked and dry.  The \"award winning\" Margaritas were just okay.  I will give kudos to the side of guacamole.  It was pretty tasty.  The whole place needs a facelift...menu and decor.  Even our server seemed like he was just plain tired."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Worst service ever!! Sat at table for 20 minutes. No one came over to say hello or take drink orders or bring chips/ salsa. Got up and left. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I took my wife and daughter to your restaurant last night for the first time to try it out, food wasn't too bad but when we got home my wife and daughter got very sick from your food, I didn't get sick so the only thing I can contribute it to would be maybe the lettuce somebody didn't wash their hands before handling it. I hope that you will look into this and make the necessary changes so someone else doesn't have to go through what my wife and daughter did."}
{"text":"I shouldn't even be reviewing this.  I should have just agreed with other reviews.   I've eaten here before, food is decent.  I brought my family tonight.   We sat...and waited....and waited....and wai...screw that. We left.  25 min is too long to wait for a waitress to even say hi.  Horrible service.   All I have to show is this spot of salsa.   I hope it comes out in the wash.  That's more than I can say for the terrible taste of poor customer service."}
{"text":"While the food was just ok, despite telling the waitress (who seemed to barely be listening to me) that I am allergic to gluten and specifying my order carefully, I was somehow glutened and have been sick in bed since. I even ordered something labeled gluten friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant to people with food allergies."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place gets so many people. I've gone a few times.  Each time the food was bland and gross looking. The service is poor. And the place is filthy. The walls by the booths have food grime on them and so do the menus. I have to wonder how dirty the kitchen is...."}
{"text":"Terrible rude waitress. Never said Happy Easter. It's like we were a huge inconvenience for being there. The one on Cave Creek Rd is managed 10x better. The food was satisfactory not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Staying on the north side of Phoenix before I flew out in the morning. Did both a Yelp and a Google search for Mexican restaurants, and found El Encanto, When we got there, we were seated quickly and our waitress Wendy took care of us and our drink orders immediately. Just an FYI, GPS directions to the restaurant were confusing. Kind of took us on a loop to get to the restaurant which is in between 10th and 12th Ave. It is worth the confusion though. Wendy recommended we try the fundito sauce, and brought a sample. Excellent choice. Had it on our enchiladas. It's a jalapeño and white cheese in a mild sause. Margaritas were great as well, not too sour.   Overall, a great choice, and lucky for us to get Wendy as our waitress. She was excellent as well.   If you are in the north Phoenix area, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Fundido is amazing. Service is poor.  Drinks are decent.  I do like the outside patio it has s nice water feature.   Not my favorite place. I prefer plaza Bonita down the road."}
{"text":"Very consistent and great food... Close to home too so we frequent this place a lot. It's not that the food is amazing but it's pretty authentic Mexican American and we like it. Really love their salsa trio that comes with complimentary chips (especially the green variety). Tasty margaritas and I love the Flan if I have any room left... We like to sit in the bar area. Pretty fast service in there. When it's not too hot the patio is fun to hang out on with friends. A pitcher of margaritas, chips, salsa and some yummy guacamole makes for a fun happy hour with friends too!"}
{"text":"Hmm...   Nonplussed. Mind draws a blank when I think of a positive, and grows tired of all the negative that begin to stir.   So, the interior is somewhat attractive, but does not distinguish itself from other restaurants. I may not have ordered the piece de resistance here, but I did order something I thought would ignite \"tasty\" in my mouth, but didn't. Overcooked eggs, mutilated, also overdone chorizo. Chewed this stuff with a crying smile. Don't order off the Sunday brunch.   One of those places not worth the drive."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Mexican food and this place rocks.  Although it can be a bit noisy at times, the food is amazing.  I especially love the fajitas and the sampler plate.  I have to say after the sampler plate - there was little room left for the main course."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile but it's not as good as the the one on Cave Creek Rd the service and food isn't as good."}
{"text":"Been driving by for 3 years.  Kept passing it because of all the low reviews.  Then one evening I asked my two hockey buddies what their \"go to\" Mexican place was and they said El Encanto Dos.  I was surprised. They told me not to believe the reviews.  I received a transfer with my job to a northern state and so I decided to take my family here the weekend before we moved.  Let me tell you we are regretting not coming sooner.  All of us felt the place was really good.  I'm a Mexican food snob and normally I would give this place four stars but I'm giving five because I can't believe how many low reviews there are.  I also don't want anybody else to drive by this place for three years only to end up trying it on their last weekend in Arizona like us.  Don't drive by.  Give this place a try.  The bad reviews are crazy.  We thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of mexican food but when I find something I like, I love it. El Encanto Dos has awesome food. I would highly recommend the Pollo Fundito and the Taquitos (Rolled Tacos). They also have a great guacamole appetizer and prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying this review may not be appropriate considering I'm from Tucson which has THE best Mexican food and I'm now forced to eat the \"Mexican food\" here in North Phoenix. But even with that said, there should be at least something available at a restaurant like this that at least remotely resembles Mexican food.   We had the carne asada tacos which are as basic a Mexican food as you can get. The tacos came with thick tortillas and chewy meat. The only authentic thing about them was they were served w/lime wedges.   My kids ordered the chicken flautas (rolled tacos for the North Phoenicians) and they were just on the good side of edible-so the kids weren't as disappointed which I was thankful for. Now let's talk  rice, oh the rice! It was possibly the most awful rice we have ever eaten. Bland, dry and nothing like a Spanish nor Mexican rice.   The salsa was lacking spice (almost any spice would have be appreciated-some salt...a jalapeño....call me crazy) and the service was just sad. We left feeling sad.  I wish we had a genuine Mexican restaurant somewhere near by! I gave it 2 stars  just so it doesn't close down and we don't have a patio to have drinks on come this winter.  PS-Fundido is not Mexican. Ewwww, just ewww people!"}
{"text":"Such great food! They even had a man playing music and singing for everyone. Great atmosphere. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I like the one in Cave Creek better but still not great. The food was mediocre at best, the taco shells were so thick and tough it was hard to eat. The margaritas have a very strange taste, almost taste like perfume. Prices are high and the menu is small"}
{"text":"Finally........I've been out here for several yrs now, and haven't found a place that I really like everything about.  Well here it is.  Service was excellent.  Food was delicious. Atmosphere ---can't beat it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Margaritas!! Service always nice and Natalie is a great bartender! We walk in and she remembers what we ate and drank the time before. Pollo Fundido is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has mixed reviews. And you are about to see another one.  Let's start with the first impression. I love the ambiance;  the mexican tile and the porch and all of it just works for me. I was excited for what was to come!  That excitement was dulled a bit by the LOOOOONNGG wait for service. I have only been there twice: once in the earlier evening hours on a weekday, and once on a Saturday around 2pm. Both times I was with a group of 6-8 people, so I was chatting and it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but if I had had a margarita in my hand it would have been much better.   Once the margarita came, I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I had plowed almost through it before my food came (and I was taking tiny little sips). This is a great way to make customers order more drinks, but NOT a good way to keep them happy.   I ordered the combo beef & chicken fajita quesadilla. I LOVED it. I dreamed about it later. I should explain; I'm kind of a mexican food wimp and I don't like super-spicy (and my experience in Phoenix was that lots of mexican food was super-spicy), but this was just flavorful. I know, it's a really gringo kind of meal, but I loved it. The chips and salsa and guacamole were great too.  Now we have ambiance, food and drinks on the positive side and service on the negative. The thing is, the service problem kept recurring like a bad chorus in a song. Every time I thought, \"This food is so good I've almost forgiven them,\" the server would disappear again. So, I just don't know how I feel about them.  I guess, if I'm ever around there again, I might sit at the bar and have a margarita..or I would go when I wasn't very hungry, or I would order takeout. And if you feel oddly dissatisfied with this review, you'll know exactly how I feel about El Encanto Dos."}
{"text":"Sat for over ten minutes waiting to get service after the hostess Zoey informed us it was against company policy to seat a group of nine in anything other than two booths.   Do NOT waste your time at El Encanto Dos, we love the original and have never experienced bad service.   After going to El Encanto Dos and being ignored by the hostesses over multiple visits my family and I are appalled that it's still open. Customers are not first at this restaurant, do NOT waste your time or hard earned money because they do not care."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and I order the pollo fundido every time! Its so rich and delicious I can't order anything else. I like how I can order a full or half plate of it. Great service and love the atmosphere. Live music on most weekends too.. Inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this place more and more as they seem to improve their consistency on every order. Years ago it was hit or miss.   I'm typically an on the rocks dude but these frozen margaritas are the beez neez.   Overall, my most favorite Mexican food option up on Carefree Hwy."}
{"text":"We've had both dinner and lunch here and the food has always been very good. The atmosphere is very nice - fireplace, outdoor dining, Mexican tile.  We've also had excellent waitresses every single time we've been there!  We're looking forward to their farmer's market that should start in October!"}
{"text":"Well...I liked going to this place because it's conveniently located and the food is generally good.  However, the service is hit and miss, especially on a weekend when they get busy. It appears they don't train their staff well and are always short-handed during the busiest times. The attitude of the staff consistently seems to be one of indifference.  I put our names on the list for an outdoor table and then waited at the bar for my husband to show up (he was only a few minutes away).  When he showed up, we had a drink and then waited for about 45 minutes. Several tables outside were empty.  When I went to the host to inquiry why we hadn't been seated yet, he said it would be another 20 minutes. I asked about the empty tables and he said they didn't have enough servers for them. I went back to the bar, asked my husband what he wanted to do.  We decided to eat at the bar, informed the bartender, then went back to the host (a young teenager who seemed clueless) and gave our beeper back.  We then waited another 20 minutes for the bartender to come back to take our order, I went back to the host to explain how long we've been waiting and that we would take first available.  The manager was there at the time. They put us at the end of the wait list now and told us it would be another 45 minutes. Nice! I went back to get my husband and leave. However, the bartender was now there to take our order. When I acted a little perturbed that she didn't come back to take our order for so long, she rudely said \"well I told you it would be a few minutes.\"  Anyway, with the amount of time invested in this dinner and being incredibly hungry, we went ahead and gave our order to the bartender. The food came about 30 minutes later and it was cold.  While we choked it down (we didn't dare send it back after all this), people were lined up next to us to order drinks -- they were not getting service at their tables. So, I had people yelling in my ear and probably spitting in my food while they talked! It was a complete mess and we won't be going back. Too bad..."}
{"text":"I like this place for their margaritas, chicken tacos and the pollo fundido. Sometimes the chicken in the pollo fundido is dry :( hit or miss. The tacos are yum and the outdoor patio is beautiful. Sometime there is live music which makes it special. I find the main dining room kinda cold. The service is usually pretty good - sometimes slow. Overall, I really enjoy coming here, it's close and the food is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"We make frequent stops here and to be honest this time not impressed at all!!   The food was great we had the steak fajitas and my daughter a cheese crisp.  I'm giving the 3 stars for the food the waitress was awful and I hate to even leave a review like this for the restaurant but they have to know what's going on in the front of house as much as the back.   We had ordered ice tea, our dinner took about an hour in full and we had to ask for refills to even get a second glass.  The girl was way to interested in the table of teens that were in to visit to even worry about if we needed anything at all.  To say the least not impressed and this might be our last stop here... unfortunately"}
{"text":"The Burros are pretty good. Green salsa was tasty! Overall a good experience, we will return next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 14 for lunch. I have been to places where I can be a nightmare for a restaurant to accommodate a large party. I believe they handled it pretty well.  The chips are very good. Large and fresh. There are 3 kinds of salsa the come with the chips. A mild red, a medium green and a red spicy  habanero  salsa. Didn't try the habanero but the other salsas we good. I had the Enchiladas De Pollo Con Mole. The mole sauce is the star of this dish.The chicken is shredded and little dry but with the mole it was very good.  The portion for lunch for me was small . Only one enchilada with black beans and rice for $10.99.  My wife had an Enchilada with cheese, peppers and onions. She tried both red and green sauces with the green being her favorite. Would definitely come back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Been eating here since they opened Dos. In fact, to get there, we drive right by El Encanto in Cave Creek. We like Dos better!  Very efficient wait staff (we always eat in the bar). I love their chicken burros doused in mild salsa. That mild salsa is made up of nearly 20 different items and has never let us down. Our chips are always great!   Love the place and the staff, Just wish El Encanto was as good to save us the miles!"}
{"text":"NOT like Cave Creek, not even close. Haven't been to Cave Creek in 3 months, hope they didn't change Went for lunch to Dos with a friend, horrible mushy , slimy Jalapeño Rellenos, and a mushy \"Chimichanga\" which was a burrito with what they call Red Sauce. Mgr took it off bill because cook never fried it. Jalapeños tasted slimy canned, not crispy Relleno. Rice dry and no flavor, beans canned I'll bet. Torta was limp old bread, hard to pickup bread limp. Salsa the hot one I used to love tasted like canned Las Palmas Red Chili Salsa and no tomato flavor, just chili paste flavor. Friend moving so last lunch together I was so upset I disappointed him as he picked El Encanto Dos. Margarita with the cheapest tequila and in strawberry he said tasted like strawberry & lots of sugar, aftertaste not good cheap tequila  Dirty sticky table and menus filthy. When I order red sauce, it should be RED! A correct chimichanga is crispy with red sauce on the side Slimy, mushy food that would have been 60 plus $ for lunch if not for the mgr deducting my not chimichanga is too expensive for me for what you get $40 check was still too much as we didn't eat 1/4 of the food, it was THAT bad Waitress was nice but overwhelmed at 1:15 What did you do?! It's terrible food now! I'll try El Encanto in Cave Creek where the rich live If it's like this was, I'll try somewhere else We were going to have a party this month at Dos No way will I be embarrassed by the food Get your act together , please! Now I have to drive 1/2 hr plus instead of 10-15 minutes You have a beautiful setting, now make the food the same New Manager, Cooks, Housekeeping Staff, whatever Lots of people in New River and Anthem are saying this same thing, I thought they were wrong Sorry, it was THAT bad"}
{"text":"What a great treat. The food was great. I really liked it. Carne asada was a hefty, nicely seasoned piece of meat. It was thick. I loved it. Everyone in our work group enjoyed their food. This is a large restaurant, large bar with outdoor seating. Nice. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Our lunch experience at El Encanto Dos was pretty good! We enjoyed our time and our food. The manager/owner came over periodically to check on or table and food. It was nice that he was friendly and went around to all the tables.   Our server was OK but seemed a little too busy to give us excellent service. That's the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. The food was good and the prices are reasonable. The portions are huge so the lunch size is just right."}
{"text":"Defently do not recommend this place.... The waiter admitted that they pre-cook there carne asada two days prior to serving it to their customers!!! Warm it up and serve it!! Just not right!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and snotty waitress!  Skip the Dos and go to the original El Encanto in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Bad service?  Try atrocious.  The place looked jam packed.  We ask for a table for two.  We were told by the manager it would be 35 to 40 minute wait.  No big deal we will have a drink at the bar and wait.  The bartender was extremely rude.  We order two drinks and as soon as she turns around to fetch them our pager goes off.  Thinking it's a mistake because it's been about three minutes I go to check at the front.  No mistake.  We tab out grab our drinks and head to our seat.    We were sat in the corner of a huge room next to a party of 50.  Who goes out to dinner with 20 people?  Seriously?  The little Harry potter looking kid that sat us down literally said just a warning we are all very short tempered tonight.  I look at my wife and tilted my head.  I said I hope none of them have guns.  Like biggie smalls said, \"Yep, tote chrome for situations like this\".  Back to the review, Harry potter dropped his warning and flew off on his broom without leaving any menus.  No worries we had brought our drinks and chips and salsa from the bar.  Real vets here.    Finally another guy drops more chips and three salsas off.  He also flashed away before I could ask for menus.  15 minutes later a sweaty stressed female runs up about 15 feet from our table and gives me the one second finger.  Seems how we were miming I mimed bring some menus please.  She lipped back ok thank you.  10 minutes later she arrived with menus but no water.  She then also flashed away before I could ask for some.  I felt like I was at a horrible cirque de soleil at this point with awful salsa and iced down drinks.  She finally comes back and takes our order.  Apologizes for how shitty the service is and says she will bring water back.  10 minutes later she runs up and says oh waters right be right back.  Dying of thirst I'm like a camel tapping into my reserve hump.  Aka my wife's drink.  We get waters and she takes our orders and literally 20 minutes later she appears and say you guys are going to be so upset.  I forgot to put in your order and can't find your slip.  I should have got up and left right then.  But my wife didn't concur when I gave her the have you had enough look.  Well of course it is all your fault.  You took the order and have the task of delivering it to the kitchen you worthless fool I yelled at her.  Just kidding,  we regave her our order and she said the manager is in line waiting and it will be done first thing.  15 minutes later the manager brings it out, says it's hot and asks if would like anything else?  Yes, we would like 1.5 hours of our life back, we would like our meal to be comped, and we would like an apology.  Reality: I think that's all.    We eat, pay our bill, after 10 minutes of waiting for our waitress.  Then we cheersed our water cups and said never again.  Ever.  Oh the food you ask?  Slightly better than Arribas.  Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Moving up the star ladder due to lunch special every day of the week and a great mole sauce for the chicken enchilada. Only thing I didn't like was the beef in my friend's tacos. Since that wasn't my meal, it didn't matter. The chips are nice and crispy and the green and mild salsa are still my favorites. They also have a nice backyard which few visit that includes gardens,  chili peppers and live chickens. Chelsea also was a good server with a nice sense of humor.."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Our server didn't introduce herself, didn't make much of an introduction at all actually. Not knowledgeable of the menu. Not friendly. Between the time we placed our orders and when the food was brought out by someone else, she did not come to check on our table even ONCE. We were out of salsa and water and never received silverware. On top of that, she didn't come by a single time while we ate dinner, not even to ask how the food tasted. As a server in a full service restaurant, I was incredibly frustrated, as I noticed the her lack of urgency, attentiveness, and overall care for our party. Waited a lot of time for the bill and didn't receive a goodbye either. On the bright side, food was very good- only enjoyable thing about this dining experience."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The ambiance is terrific.  The food is delicious.  And they even have live music.  We've been very pleased with our meals and the iced tea is great.  Never a bad meal.  This isn't your typical Mexican food restaurant.  Everything is made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Third visit past 9pm on a Friday night and we were able to walk in and get seated right away.   We have attempted to get a table before 830pm on a Friday a few times but there is little parking, the wait and businesses of EE Dos is crazy! Popular place!  So if you can be patient, it is well worth the wait.  All our visits to EE Dos have received great food, prompt service and attention to detail for our allergies.   Food selection is large from Carnitas to Prime Rib.   As you are seated you are presented with a large serving of home made chips and 3 salsas; and water.  I have been to too many Mexican restaurants where this welcome has now disappeared or Salsa was extra!  Ambience is everything here, the restaurant is an older Santa Fe style building with plenty of patio spaces and fireplaces.  Colourful SW/Mexico decor and decorations surround your dining experience.  There is a large bar with some restaurant seating.  Recommend fresh Guacamole (not tableside) but still very good and priced right.    Off the menu I recommend grilled veggies.   Look for live music nights, we've had a solo guitar player a few times in our visits.  Staff are always polite, helpful and a  Update Sixth visit came here 8pm on Monday, counted 6 empty tables spread out around the restaurant but we are told it's a 15 minute wait for an available table.  Really hate when restaurants do this."}
{"text":"Love the food at El Encanto DOS . In my opinion they have the best Mexican food in town and it is close to home"}
{"text":"I usually love this place and their jalapeño cream cheese dip but the last time I was there was different. Our server was so unusual and not very nice. I ordered a strawberry margarita and my parents ordered a large margarita pitcher. I guess that since their margaritas are so strong that they can only serve a large pitcher to 3+ people, and my personal margarita excluded me from the count. The server looked at us like we were stupid before explaining this to us rudely. How were we supposed to know?! He rarely ever came back, and we were without water many times. Please improve your service and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that our favorite Mexican restaurant completely disappointed us on Cinco Di Mayo.  We went there completely out of our way only to find no celebration.  We came from Georgia where all the restaurants give away T-shirts and celebrate with all kind if fun things.  Our drinks were in plastic and service was slow.  We will find a different restaurant next year, actually we aren't sure this will be on our list again,"}
{"text":"I honestly never experienced such bad customer service from a hostess.  She told me it would be a few minutes and it turned to 20.  I was excited to sit on their beautiful patio but she sat us on the part of the patio where is was no heaters or nice lighting, we were the only ones sitting in that area.  I asked the hostess to change the location to be near the other diners, she had a bad attitude and told me it was a 20 minute wait while telling others diners it would be 10 minutes for their wait.  Needless to say we were never reseated.  That experience ruined my night.  I am upset I didn't address it with management as the service was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican restaurant. Nice building, so so food. On plus side service was quick.   Probably better for drinks than good.   Would not return."}
{"text":"Okay perhaps it's only 4 stars but I have to counteract people who give it 1 for silly reasons.  Not authentic Mexican?  Perhaps not standard but Mexico is a big place.  Had vegi enchiladas and my wife had vegi fajitas.  Delicious,  fresh, crunchy vegetables.   Nicely flavored, not too spicy.  I may ask for some jalapeños sliced next time, I like spicy.  Hesitated because of yelp but the place is always packed.  There is a reason. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good Mexican food place. I had a beef chimi and the beef was good. Kinda of like ropa vieja beef. The service was good and seated us with a reservation for 25. The only thing was that we had to ask for a few hints like refills , our checks weren't all right and some of the food was hard. But over all a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Love El Encanto Dos! There are very attentive to their customers and always so courteous- I will always pick them over the original up in Cave Creek if the choice is mine plus their food is much better! Definitely a 5 star"}
{"text":"Okay ... I cannot say enough good things about this place! We have tried several Mexican restaurants in Cave Creek and this is far and above the best! I can't wait to come back and bring family! The ambiance was perfect- service was great and the food was A +++ delicious! We had the Pork Shank Sunday Special (delicious) with healthy and yummy black beans- perfect chili rellenos and the best green salsa! Our margaritas were the best We have had in sometime! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here because we heard it was where the locals came and thought it might be a hidden gem - alas, it was not. It didn't have to coolness of the original El Encanto and the setting was not as interesting. It took quite a while for our waitress to come to our table, we had to ask for refills, and the food was lackluster. Green chile had no taste/heat - my son (17 months) accidentally got a bite of green sauce and never batted an eye. We will stick with the original El Encanto at least the vibe is better there."}
{"text":"I really love the food here, the atmosphere is good but customer service is not on par. The wait is always long unless you make a reservation two hours ahead. There are way too few servers for the amount of tables so there's always a table open with not enough servers to serve, also the staff is not all that friendly."}
{"text":"Best margaritas, and Pollo Fundio.  Absolutely the worst Happy Hour tacos ever.  Nice setting, just don't order the tacos."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Great Salsa!.  The ambiance is a bit off as well as the service but I would go back  for the food!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time we ate here. The 1st time was fantastic but tonight was a big disappointment. It was 100 degrees outside. When we arrived the misters were on and it was comfortable so we agreed to sit outside. We were the only ones sitting outside at that time. Within 15 minutes the outside tables started filling up. The misters were leaking over one table. Instead of moving those people to a different table, they turned them off and it was very uncomfortable. On top of that it took over an hour for us to get our food. I don't think we will eat here again until the fall or winter."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place their food is amazing! You couldn't order anything on the menus and not like it! The food and drinks are great the service is mostly good! Understanding they are crazy busy helps! The parking isn't ideal but it's okay! But I definitely RECOMMEND! It's amazing food try the sampler!"}
{"text":"I thought it was very good Mexican with nice chips and salsa. There carnitas was excellent with just the right amount of spiceness."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME. Ambiance, ok, but the tables needed to be cleaned.   Service, terrible.  It took forever to get our food, to get our bill, to get our cards back...   I won't actively seek out this place until I do takeout for the food."}
{"text":"We loved the polio fundido. The outside patio was cute. Our waiter Rich was excellent! We will be back again when we start working out."}
{"text":"Worse Mexican food I have ever ate!  I come from Ohio and had better food than this place!  Had a chicken dish with no seasoning or veggies!  Dried chicken with a dollop of creamy white sauce does not make a good dish.  The manager even came by and stated he would not charge me for the extra sauce I requested to help give the dish some flavor!  Also who serves a margarita in a water glass???? Never again, a waste of money!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I keep wanna to give them a shot but my  experience the other night will be my last. I've gone back because I've never had a horrible experience until Friday night. The server was not very good. We had to ask on several occasions to bring us our drinks or silverware and napkins. We waited for our food for about 45 minutes. When we finally received or food it was cold and mushy. My tamlae tasted like i was eating bread not masa and my taco was mush. The salsa was very very bland. I had to add some salt to give it at least some kind of taste. I understand if the restaurant is busy but you still need to have good service and food good enough or at least warm enough to want to eat. I will not be eating here again and would rather drive into town to get Mexican food. Very disappointing. So much that we're still talking about how awful it was."}
{"text":"When we first went here about a year ago, the food was good, decent portions, ok service.  Over the next few months, it all went downhill.  The restaurant got dirty, as mentioned by other reviewers, the waitstaff got a bad attitude, and the food was no longer very good....small portions, burnt or undercooked.  So we haven't been back in about 4 months and will not go back again."}
{"text":"Stoped by for lunch today with a party of 8. Took 10 minutes just to be able to talk to the hostess... she wasn't at her station and seemed to be setting up tables or clearing tables. Then she told us to be another 30 minutes before we could be seated even though it appeared to be a lot of empty seats around. After about 45 minutes we finally got seated. Just before we got seated somebody in our party talked to the manager and was told rudely \"next time get a reservation\" with no apology offered. Waiter was excellent but waiting time to get the food was also ridiculous. Food was OK but overpriced. would definitely not recommend this place until hostess and manager are replaced."}
{"text":"So its been years since we have ate here. Like 8 our 9 years.  Been in the area for 18 years.  So today we stopped in.  Wanted to set on the patio. I peeked in the door and i didnt see a hostess, we just started walking to the patio to seat our selfs. Their were other people already seating at the patio.     Then out of know wear here came the hostess and says to us u need to check in before seating down.  She wasnt very nice with her tone and was very rude.    I said u weren't their.  It took 15 mins before someone came and took order. Services was really SLOW, but she was super nice. Im sure it wasn't her, it was the kitchen.  She said they were short handed.  Food was ok.  But the margarita was super Good.  I will say, not sure if we will come back soon. And that the hostess need to not say rude things under her breath when she not were she was to be. Get some people skills  If my mom wasnt with me i would of said a few things to her but i didnt because my mom was their."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in North Phoenix, they took us here for dinner. We had a party of 10 with 4 teens. We were 15 minutes late for our reservation and they were busy. Not sure what happened but we waited on our food for over an hour. We enjoyed the conversation but were starting to get hungry.   When the food came it was worth the wait. Really fantastic. The waitress apologized up and down for the delay and the manager stopped by to apologize and comp two of our dishes.   We left, went home and got up for our flight in the morning to discover that my 11-year-old had left her purse (with her vacation cash) and iPhone at the restaurant.   On the way to the airport at 8AM we stopped by to see if anyone was there. A worker in the kitchen was super helpful and tried contacting the manager to access the safe. Unfortunately he could not connect and we had to leave to catch our flight.   Our friends stopped by later to recover the wallet and phone with the cash still inside.   If there were marks for credibility and ethics on Yelp, El Encanto would be off the charts. I loved the food and even though there were hiccups in the timing of the service, they fixed it. I would go back here again and again and recommend that you do too."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star!  Terrible, terrible! Drinks, food, and service.  I even had to go to the manager to ask if someone could wait on us....We waited 10 minutes for someone to wait on us, but it wasn't till I said something.  Then we got the food....cardboard...no cheese at all in anything.   I can't even explain.. I'm from Boston and we have pretty good Mexican restaurants.....compared to this!! Very surprised that it's crowded all the time...maybe because people out here don't know any better or nothing convenient to the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved to the area a few months ago and finally decided to try this place for Happy Hour on a Friday.   Right after we sat down at a booth in the bar area, we received chips, three types of salsa, and carafe of ice water. After a few minutes, our waitress Rikki (based on our receipt) took our drink orders and then brought us menus. She gave a good impression by being very personable and seemed to have a fun personality.   The menu wasn't very big, which is fine I guess, but there was not an option to order a combination meal such as 1 taco and 1 enchilada so I just got the two cheese enchiladas meal. A guy with a short ponytail delivered our food by saying \"hello\" like it was a question and then left (I overheard him say this to another table so I guess it's just his thing). I was ready for another beer (it's happy hour!) but I never saw Rikki again until she dropped off the check.   While I was eating, a young boy came by and cleaned the windows on the door that was directly next to me, which in turn sprayed some glass cleaner ON my food. Before the spray, the enchis were decent and the rice was really good. My boyfriend ordered fries and rice with his tacos but only rice showed up and Rikki wasn't around to tell.  As we ate, booths started filling up but there were two servers in the bar area so I see no reason for her never coming back. I did notice a couple of the other groups were known by name so perhaps because we are not regulars that we did not deserve as good of service.  In the future we may try this place again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Place is great. Has a good atmosphere, food is tasty and overall good bang for your buck. Not sure how abyone can give it 1 star but I guess if you're a food snob maybe but hell it is not fine dining it is just a solid Mexi joint."}
{"text":"In previous visits the food was very good.  However the service was so slow today I never got to order.  Sat at the bar and waited 10 minutes and still had not ordered.  Bartender seemed very busy while  entering data on a computer.  I saw him serve 1 drink (my soda) and no food.  Many employees walking around but nobody interested in taking an order.  This was after lunch peak and before dinner."}
{"text":"Love this Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere is really relaxing and even a little romantic especially during the fall months when it's cool out in the evenings. We love sitting on the outdoor patio while enjoying the vegetarian enchiladas. Definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"Was here about a year ago, and the food was fair at best, thought we would give it another try....bad move! Went there on Sunday, May 5th. The parking lot was full for the \"Cinco\". What a disappointment! The food was bland...don't order anything with  \"So Called Steak\" in it...so tough I couldn't eat it, and I have had better salsa out of a jar! In all fairness, the beer was cold! Really felt like we wasted $60.00....."}
{"text":"Above average food, service great, clean, great patio. Will do again. Sergio's original paintings are awesome!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite.  Late lunch on a Sunday.  Sat in the bar since it was an in between time and had great service and quick lunch. Tostada for me, carnitas burro for him. And of course a  small pitcher of margarita's, frozen since it's such a hot day.  I always appreciate a lunch menu for small portions than dinner."}
{"text":"While in the area, we stopped for a late lunch. We sat in the bar because that's where he always sat when he came here. We were there for about 5 minutes and ignored by the bartender who was talking with what appeared to be a waitress about her vacation to California.  We decided to move to the dining room. As we approached the hostess station a gentleman said I hope you enjoyed your food, come again. I informed him that we had not eaten yet, as we were ignored in the bar and wanted a table in the dining room. He apologized, sat us at a table and offered us an appetizer on the house. Our waitress was right out and said any appetizer was on the house. I was impressed that it was already communicated to the waitress before she came to our table (good job!!). Our service for the rest of our meal was outstanding!  The pollo fundido is amazing and very cheesy. My boyfriend had the enchiladas de pollo con mole. The sauce was so flavorful. I have never had mole before but one bite and I was hooked.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Almost inedible food at large prices. El encanto used to have great food and service, but that totally went away a couple of years ago. Service is actually ok, but the only thing that was actually ok was the chips. Salsa was even tasteless. We have gone to both places and both are now equally bad. The bad review is just to let someone know how far this once great place has fallen."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the review for only 3 stars. My daughter and I came in from Texas, where Mexican food is king, and we absolutely loved this place.    Great patio, great ambiance, 3 very good different salsa's, phenomenal tacos, and good sauces on entrees.  I personally got the Plato de Mexican and it was great.    If I had a complaint, the service was pretty slow.  It appears they were understaffed on the night we went or were busy than expected.  The food, however, was excellent."}
{"text":"It might just be that we didn't order the right stuff or that they have Americanized too much.  My short impression is that the food was bland and pretty dull.  My wife ordered the Tacitos and while these are usually bland by design, it's the dipping sauce that gives them life and the Avacado sauce was disappointing as an over whipped Avacado.  My daughter at the age of two is an incredible fan of Mexican Rice and Beans and she wouldn't touch them here, she only ate the chips and salsa, which admittingly and disappointingly was the high-life of the mean.  I had the most order Pollo Fundido, the chicken (while all white meat) was extremely bland, the only thing that saved this dish was the jalapeno cheese sauce on top.  It actually had life and would make a great Con Queso dip in it's own rights.  I would like to see the meat livened up with a little jalapeno and salsa.  Show me the food I would see when visiting friends having a Fiesta, I know it's there, let it out and show your full potential as a Mexican resturant."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location for some time. The wait staff and management are always friendly. This location can handle a lot of people so if the parking lot looks busy, come on in, since the wait is typically not that long.  I love the fundito dip, the fish taco/meal and the house margaritas.  Good food and a good value."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the sea food enchiladas. Once I found those I stopped trying anything new. The verde salsa is very fresh and a nice change up to the typical red salsas. I'm not a fan of spicy but my husband really enjoys the spicy salsa. The ambiance on the patio is fun and relaxing (especially around march at sunset- gorgeous!).   The restaurant is pretty large but it can still get slightly busy on the weekends during spring. There is a small garden area you can amuse yourself in while you wait for a table or you can order a drink at the bar and hang outside.  You might want to throw the address into your GPS because it kind of sneaks up on you.   Don't let the dirt parking lot fool you, this place is tasty and worth a try. Speaking of worth a try, definitely try the house margaritas - very tasty!!    I think it's good for groups but if you have a group more than 6 you may need to call for a reservation (if possible) if going on the weekend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ate in the bar both times, had Dos Equis on draft and the two tamale platter once. Second time ordered the carne asada tacos and shrimp tacos. The carne asada tacos were the best! Great service."}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Atmosphere was nice on the patio for brunch. My son enjoyed his scrambled eggs and being able to run around since it was not very busy. Saturday morning 10:30am."}
{"text":"I don't understand the reviews. Don't most people know this is American Mexican and not authentic Mexican ? If you want authentic go to la parilla suiza. It's a completely different food. If you want great Mexican food this a great place.   Service was great. Queso dip was a little watery but the flavor was awesome. The pollo fundidos were also good.   You will like this place. Great chips and salsa. Perfect margaritas. And normal quality mex American food.   I would really ignore the other reviews. When someone only posts 3 horrible reviews and that's it, it should tell you something."}
{"text":"Came here on Cinco de Mayo, so they were very busy. Service was good & the staff was friendly. Expected some sort of drink specials but there was only 1 marg which had jalapeño in it, so opted out of that. House margs made w/ cheap Sauza tequila were $7. Ouch!  I had a beef taco salad which was very good w/ tasty strips of steak. My wife had a cup of albondiga soup. It's only resemblance to authentic albondigas was that it had meatballs in it. It was more like canned soup. Overall, our dinner was not very satisfying."}
{"text":"We go here once every few months. Being where it is at, it is a 20 min ride for us to get there. I don't know how or why I talk myself into this place... my wife \"likes\" it - so maybe that is the reason.  I have never had a horrible bad experience, but I have never had a WOW experience either. The pricing is more than your corner Mexican restaurant - the place is REALLY cool - so I would expect the food to be more/better.  Just average - just A-OK - Just Satisfying. Good to go - just don't expect anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"This is the closest good Mexican food to the Anthem area and because of this, I come around often  The price isn't too wild for the portion sizes served, but keep in mind they only have happy hour if you sit at the bar.   I have been here quite a few times and granted I usually go during the week nights we never wait too long to be sat or for the food to come out.   The service is OK...more often than not we have to wait a while to be greeted once we sit down or they tend to forget you're there after you've eaten.  Nothing is phenomenal and nothing is absolutely terrible. Really just a dependable place to eat when so limited by what the area offers."}
{"text":"Yuck. Extremely BLAND, yet SALTY food. A 7 year old ordered a cheese quesadilla that was presented to him open face and he replies out loud, \"this looks like a nightmare\"! I was laughing out loud, but at the same time it's NOT funny.   I ordered the \"5 shrimp\" chef special with green rice and supposedly their award winning margarita in peach. It was peachless with a hint of peach color, but definitely not the flavor.   The only thing this place has going for it is the exterior/landscaping. Sorry."}
{"text":"Drove by this place on the way back from a meeting. Checked it out on Yelp decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. They give you 3 different salsas and chips the minute you're seated at the table. All are very good.   Tried the Pollo Fundido, as so many on Yelp had recommended it. It lived up to the reviews. I will say this, though, it is not a light lunch by any means. Eat this baby at noon, and you'll be snoozing by 2 PM in your chair at the office.   Many things in the menu looked tasty. Wish I were in the area more often so I could try the rest."}
{"text":"Chips and salsas were very good. Albondigos soup was fantastic with tasty meatballs. Seafood Enchiladas very good but a little salty. This is one of the better Mexican places. I can only guess that the negative reviewers have no clue on good Mexican."}
{"text":"Food is really good but all the waitresses seem like they have something better to do. Also they're closed every other fucking day so I don't know how they manage to stay in business. Closed for \"employee appreciation\" at least once a month. When the \"employees\" are terrible. And closed on super bowl Sunday? Cmon now. Fuckin garbage"}
{"text":"We had a good dinner here. Very busy but seated right away. Appetizer of jalapeños rellano was good. Too spicy for me but very good. Hubby loved them. I had carne Asada tacos good meat not tough or fatty. Fish taco with black beans & rice also good. Service was prompt. We would return."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here. I am not sure if it is new owners or what but the place was clean, the food was perfectly prepared and alot of it too.   I had the sampler platter, the pollo fundito was one of the best i have had, filled with white meat, perfect spice to the sauce, the beans were good, the chips and salsa was really good.   We will go back, and judging by the 100's of others there, so will they.   Please try it and let us know."}
{"text":"This was our absolute favorite Mexican place for almost a year. The food is fantastic but we had a horrible service experience yesterday and now we won't be going back. I walked inside and asked the hostess if my sister and I could please have an outdoor table since we were going to have a dog with us. She said no problem and showed us to our table. After our first round of drinks arrived, the manager came over and told me that \"there are no dogs allowed, we cannot make any exceptions\". I was taken aback and I apologized, told him I didn't know, and that I had told the hostess we had a dog and she sat us. He offered no apology whatsoever and simply repeated that we could not have a dog on the patio. He acted like there had been a 20 foot sign posted over the entryway that said NO DOGS that we had chosen to ignore and that we were idiots for not knowing the rule. Again he offered no apology and simply walked away. I don't normally leave anything but positive reviews but I was so upset but this guys attitude really rubbed me the wrong way. I'm also not the type to bring my dog everywhere with me and totally get that not everywhere allows them but I didn't appreciate being made to feel like the bad guy when there was no indication they weren't allowed, either written anywhere or by the hostess when we checked in. I don't have any patience for rude management, no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Used to be good.   Went with family on Saturday night and this was a big mistake.    The area is obviously under-served by decent restaurants, so this facility gets away making millions on below average service. 1.  Had to go get our own chip refill at the bar 2.  Never got the original drink order, so went to the bar 3.  No utensils with meal 4.  Food 'warm' at best 5.  Had to go back for more soda  Finally...asked for take out.  Went home so we could get some chips/coke and reheat the meal."}
{"text":"I have personally tried everything on the menu and you cannot go wrong; however the chicken fundido is the flagship item. A good tip is to call ahead and make reservation since they are packed nearly every night."}
{"text":"El Encanto Dos is A~Ok if your in the area looking for a good place to eat.  This is the little sister restaurant of the El Encanto in Cave Creek.  There are subtle differences in their food between restaurants but this location is pretty good and it's easier for us to get to from the I17.  We love the ambiance of this restaurant especially their patio.  If given the option and weather permitting, I recommend dinning on their patio.  They have a wonderful fire place on their patio and they have heaters for when it gets colder.  On some weekend nights they have the most wonderful guitar player playing while you dine.  It's cool to see some of the local's ride their horses to the restaurant and tie them to the post surrounding the parking lot.  We always have good service but then again I'm not afraid to say something when their service is slow.  They always acknowledge when they are slow and make amends to step up their service to ensure your dinning experience is exceptional.   Their queso and spinach con queso are some what average, but their salsa and chips are good and a nice start to your dinner. Their taquitos are a bit dry, but then again I've never had a taquitos that wasn't dry, and comes with a wonderful chipotle salsa for dipping. You can't go wrong with their Seafood enchiladas, any of their enchiladas either pollo or steak smothered in their homemade Mole sauce, red or green chili sauces. Their fajitas are also good either steak or pollo. Their Pescado Enpapelado and carnitas poblano relleno are ok but don't plan to order them any time soon.  This is a good place to go with the family and friends if your in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops in the North Valley.  Good food, good selection, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've lived in the valley for 30 years, so I have had the opportunity to try many different Mexican restaurants.  On Sunday evening, September, 6th, at around 5:00 pm, my wife and I decided to give El Encanto Dos a try.  There was a healthy supply of cars in the parking lot which is always a good sign to us. Upon arriving, we were greeted with architecture and decorations that were lively and gave us the feeling we were in old Mexico. Our server was Mary, who was pleasant, helpful, and on top of things throughout our entire dining experience.  As I watched other diner/server interactions in our section, pleasant, prompt and courteous service seemed to be the rule, rather than the exception. I was equally impressed with the general manager, Maria, who made regular rounds checking on customers and eliciting feedback, all while wearing a pleasant smile and helping to create a pleasant environment, and one in in which you genuinely felt the manager was actively involved and on top of things, rather than camped out in an office somewhere. On to the food; first we were brought complimentary chips which were warm and crispy. With the chips came green salsa, house sauce, and red chipotle sauce. These were the perfect compliment to the chips and none were too hot, although, the red chipotle sauce does have a nice kick to it. Next, my wife and I looked at the menu and after seeing several things we wanted, decided we'd share our food.  First up was the appetizer, 2 shrimp tacos for $9.99 described on the menu as \"Fresh shrimp inside two lightly fried corn tortillas, filled with lettuce, queso fresco, red onions, shredded carrots and crema fresca.\" These were delicious! Each taco was stuffed to the max with filling and El Encanto did not skimp on the shrimp!  The first entree we ordered was the Plato Burro (from the menu) \"A fresh flour tortilla filled with your choice of filling. Served with Mexican rice & refried beans. May be deep fried. Shredded chicken, Carnitas, refried beans or vegetables 10.99 Green chile beef or shredded beef 12.99 Carne or Pollo Asada 14.99. Add sauce 1.99 Sub whole wheat tortilla .99\" We ordered ours with shredded beef, deep fried, covered with fundido sauce.  The shredded beef had a wonderfully seasoned taste and the fundido  sauce is out of this world! The only suggestion I would make, is if you order one deep fried, get the sauce on the side, so your deep fried shell remains crispy throughout the meal. For our second entree, we ordered the seafood enchiladas ( from the menu) \"El Encanto's famous blend of shrimp and bay scallops fill two flour tortilla enchiladas. They are topped with green sauce and a dollop of fundido sauce. Served with black beans and rice. 14.99\" There were a lot of shrimps and scallops in the enchiladas! Combined with the sauces, this dish was superb and well worth the price. My wife decided to try a frozen margarita and was offered a choice from one of many different flavors including regular, strawberry, banana, mango, prickly pear, etc. She went with the regular flavor of which I had a few sips.  So nice to be able to drink a margarita in which the taste of a quality tequila is prevalent! A server told us the margaritas were addicting and she was right!  The wife and I agreed that El Encanto Dos Margaritas would definitely be included in future visits.  Finally, the rice and beans served with dinner at other Mexican restaurants have never been a favorite of my wife's, nor mine, and usually end up in a doggy bag to be tossed at a later date,  The flavor and consistency of El Encanto's black beans, refried beans, and rice, are so good, we cleaned our plates.  It wasn't until I went to write my review that I read some of the other comments about El Encanto Dos.  I was extremely surprised because I couldn't find one negative thing about our experience...and I looked hard.  If you've never tried El Encanto Dos, I'd encourage you to give it a chance, and decide for yourself if I just had a lucky experience, or if it's as good as I say! I know I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food!   Love Wendy she is the best waitress.   The service is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, which means it is good enough to have customers keep coming back.  Food: is really good though! My favorite is the Seafood Enchiladas! It comes with black beans and rice. My boyfriend and I shared this dish, he got the stuffed jalapeños peppers for an appetizer as well. I like their margaritas too.  They have tables and booths (they can have different wait times). They're good for groups, but you might want to call in for reservations. They have a sitting area just for waiting. The restaurant feels big and it is decorated nicely. Casual clothing though.  Negative star for not being handicap accessible (no ramp nor designated handicap parking spots) and quick service, they just want you in and out. The service is fairly basic, nothing too personable."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service!  Love the atmosphere... Would highly recommend the spinach queso dip they offer and the pollo fundido for an entree is fantastic!  The chips and salsa are tasty...  Also, in the winter, sitting outside is so fun!! Love the outside bar with super friendly bartenders!  My favorite server is Natalie, she's always upbeat, happy and does a great job!"}
{"text":"Dead spices, limp chips, unimaginative salsa. Tacos are tasteless, enchiladas are small. This restaurant caters to snow birds who think this is Mexican tradition. Taco meat? It's not real Mexican flavored, it tastes as though they are trying to stretch spices for cost savings. Drinks are unoriginal. Margaritas are......NOT.  Ask for a swirl, margarita blended with sangria and prepare for a dumbfounded look. Cleanliness lacks! Prepare for menus doused in stale salsa. Tables crusty with dried......whatever from the last patrons. Both restaurants are the same.  After giving this group almost two years of patronage, nothing changes. One day I hope  it's food will match its decor.  Tourists trap."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the original in cavecreek strictly on service and accessibility but if I must say I think their food is a bit better as well.   My parents frequent this location on a weekly basis and occasionally I get to tag along and participate in the fun. Every lunch or dinner usually starts off with chips and salsa (3 types) and a large pitcher of frozen margaritas.   El Encanto Dos has basically ruined margaritas for me, as its hard to find any as strong and as good tasting anywhere else. They just taste right!! But watch yourself, like I said, they are potent.   I don't change up my selections very often because the Pollo Fundido is just too delicious to stray away from. I suggest it to everyone if they are unsure on what looks good to them or just want my opinion on something to get. It's a must try at El Encanto and I would suggest getting a half size portion just because it is so filling. The mild but tangy cream sauce will keep you coming back time and time again.   As for service, My family and I threw a surprise 60th birthday for my dad here and all of the staff helped out and made it really special for him . They accommodated our 30 or so guests and had special menus out for our party. We couldn't have asked for a better set of staff to help us with a such a special event. And to top it off the service is like that all the time. They are always super helpful, recognize the regulars, and are very friendly at all times."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for dinner with the family. Luckily we got there early because it got very busy. It's a nice big restaurant with a large beautiful patio. Service tonight was just okay. She brought us what we needed and took care of us but wasn't personable at all.   Not a huge fan of there chips and salsa. The food was good but nothing special. I got the pollo asada salsa dish which was grilled chicken with a green sauce with rice and beans. It was tasty and large portion. I will order it again. My fiancé got the chili Rellano carne asada and enjoyed it. Family got the steak fajitas and they looked great with tons of meat.   Overall dinner was good. Good casual dinner. Nothing fancy but food was good. Will be back. Thanks (:"}
{"text":"The food was great ! Must try the fundito and the flan is the best I think I have tried ... Wendy our waitress made our dinner special ... She took extra care of me and my family (there was 8 total).  She had a many great suggestions and kept a big smile through it all :)"}
{"text":"Great food, and our family of eight tried a number of different items and no one was dissatisfied. The pollo Fundito was a big hit by a few people in the party. Our server Wendy was terrific! She was attentive, friendly, and ready with descriptions and recommendations.  The skinny margaritas were yummy with a nice bit of tang. We also sampled a few desserts. The winner was the Flan,but only by a small margin over the three other desserts tried.  I would recommend you stop in and try the food if you are near Cave Creek. In another month or so sitting on the patio for your meal will be fabulous."}
{"text":"From the wait time and loaded parking lot, I was hopeful this place was going to leave me feeling like I'd want to come back. The environment was great and staff was nice. The food however; pretty standard and not that flavorful. Tried their popular dish and I wasn't that impressed. The server warned that the plate was hot, but I didn't observe the food being that hot. The rice looked like it had been made hours ago. It had that overcooked look and was dry/crunchy in some spots."}
{"text":"Excellent Margaritas! Had fun here visiting my cousin, Food and salsa were good, guitarist and fire added to the fun!"}
{"text":"wow. i can see why this place needed a second location! i have a new favorite mexican restaurant and its name is el encanto dos!   let's start with drinks. my prickly pear margarita was fantastic. his beer was cold, and reasonably priced to boot! the cute little carafe of water (with a lemon slice) on the table was a nice touch as well. it was that kind of attention to detail that impressed me. next was the chips and salsa. i didn't get the feeling that the chips were made in house (boo), but the salsa tasted like it was. it had a little spicy kick and the ingredients tasted very fresh.  and now the food ... what a wow factor! the beef taquitos were our starter. they were crispy and the meat was plentiful. the avocado/tomatillo dipping sauce was super yummy! for the main event i had to take daren c. and pity d.'s advice on the fundido. when delivered, it did not disappoint ... a cheesy, white meat chicken delight. by far the best one i've ever had. he had the shredded beef tacos and said they were very good ... they must have been because he cleaned his plate before i could snag a bite. we both loved the rice and i was kicking myself saturday morning that i didn't bring it home with me for breakfast.  our meal was timed perfectly. prices were just right. our server never pulled a disappearing act. our meal for 2 was $55 including a 20% tip. a perfect, reasonably priced restaurant to take out of town guests to that will impress without being pretentious. as we left i imagined having a relaxing meal on a cool fall evening on the el encanto dos patio ... i can't wait!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my go to restaurants. The quality and quantity of the food has been on a gradual downhill slide over the past few years, but last night it finally hit rock bottom. The cheese enchiladas were devoid of cheese, albeit a sprinkle on top reminiscent of a frozen pizza. The corn tortillas were hard and crispy, obviously over cooked. While voicing my complaint to the manager, he actually attempted to defend this abomination and became condescending.  Manager finally offered to prepare another entree but I declined. The meal was removed from the tab and a certificate for a complimentary meal was presented. Fortunately the certificate is good at the original El Encanto in Cave Creek where I will continue to dine, but never again at \"dos\"."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  We usually come on the weekends now and then for a nice wine and lunch experience.  This time, both were bad.  First, they quit carrying the Falling Star Sauvignon Blanc, and had no other Sauvignon Blanc to offer.  The waiter took forever to get me any wine at all.  I have asked a few times in the past months for them to carry the Falling Star again, but no avail.  My chicken torta was dry and horrible.  It literally had no flavor, I had to ask for mayonaise!!   I have had some amazing tortas in my life and I was expecting something fabulous.   Service was so very slow, we were so disappointed.  I love the building, the huge patio, the chance to buy fresh produce, and the food used to be very good, but I probably won't be back again.  With high prices, I expect amazing food and a good drink selection.  Table salsas were very good though."}
{"text":"This place has great ambience and could be great.... Unfortunately, the service is terrible!! Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"This place is great - the service is always top-notch and the food is consistently good.  Love the pollo fundido!!!  Great margaritas, too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on a Friday night. While there was a wait in the main restaurant, we were able to sit right up at the bar. House margarita are the best! I usually order with patron but not necessary here. Our bartender, Robbie, was AMAZING!  Super attentive on a busy night. It was fun watching him work. He doesn't miss a beat and takes care of all customers up at the bar with ease!  He clearly is experienced and made our evening so enjoyable!"}
{"text":"LOVE it....worth the drive...great outdoor patio...chips/salsa/margaritas fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I am leaving this restaurant before ordering.  The service is terrible.  Wait staff is very snotty and when we told the manager we were leaving because they could not accommodate an elderly customer they charged us for the two iced teas and a soda ... Terrible service.  And then we had to wait to pay."}
{"text":"Not real sure what happened here, but the service has really gone downhill. The food is still good, but I'd drive the extra 10-minutes and go to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Excellent and attentive service. Our fajitas came out sizzling hot. The young lady who was the bartender and server was outstanding..hard working with a great personality.."}
{"text":"Service -1 star. Seriously try to get waited on seems like a privilege.  Food 2...very basic flavors.  Location 3..nice bar and patio.  Wish they would pick it up and thank the customers who STILL come to this place every night because they are the only place around.  They really don't care about the customer."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Service is always good and reliable and it is close to home. The pollo fundido is amazing. Not the best for traditional Mexican food and the Chimi is disappointing but they are good on other dishes and great for group meals."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good mexican restaurant since I moved to Arizona. Came here for lunch, and it wasn't busy at all for being noon. Got complimentary chips and salsa. The waiter helped us with ordering and even brought out some of the sauces for us to try. He recommended the enchiladas, so I order the chicken ones with green sauce. I was overall very impressed with them and so were my friends."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere with good food.  Not quite the same ambience as the original El Encanto but always a good experience.  I love their Pollo Fundido dish and their Prickly Pear margaritas."}
{"text":"was  a little disappointed in their menu.. nice decor, okay servers.. didnt try their margaritas but hear great things. food wasnt  that great, i felt like i  couldve had a better experience at  taco bell"}
{"text":"The service was very slow and the food mediocre at best.  I would not recommend nor will I return."}
{"text":"Wow! What a disappointment for this once great place. Food was still acceptable but no football, just really loud, ear splitting music.  So loud the customers complaints must not have been heard because it just kept on cranking. The adjacent table left mad.....we left with a headache."}
{"text":"If your looking for a clean restaurant do not come here. My husband and I have gone several times thinking maybe the last time was just an exception. Unfortunately that's not the case. The tables are ALWAYS gross. I have to wave the millions of flys away from my food! The service in the bar area is always bad. Even the \"manager\" just stands around chatting with the staff instead of following up with customers. They clearly do not have a cleaning schedule where the customers sit I can only imagine what the cook area looks like!! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We had appetizers that were out of this world. The Jalapeño Relleno was to die for. When the Manager found out this was our first time, she offered us a complementary dessert. Very nice & yummy too."}
{"text":"I just changed their menu it's a little more streamlined now.  I had the plato burro with carnitas, chimichonga style. some of the best  carnitas I've ever had!"}
{"text":"3 stars for service, 4 stars for food & price. I've been here at least 5 times and it is always good. They have TVs in the bars, the actual restaurant is a little messy and the hostesses are less than inviting mostly. The place is a little off the beaten path to say the least. There is another one in downtown Cave Creek."}
{"text":"We went there on a Monday afternoon.  It was slightly crowded.  We sat in the bar area.  It took a while to be noticed.  We placed our order which came in good time.  The meal was terrible.  I ordered pollo fundido and did not like it at all.  The only thing I could taste was sour cream.  I would not go back, I would sooner drive to Phoenix and get better food."}
{"text":"Had fun at the open Catina area, but that's about all. This was only our second time at El Encanto Dos, but it was not any better. Food is mediocre at best and over priced for Mexican food. Our server had no personality what so ever. It seems that more and more servers are from Boringtown. The service was extremely slow as well. With plenty of Mexican food restaurants to choose from, this one is STILL at the bottom of our list."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food. Salsa, all three of them are house made and delicious.  Meat is always flavorful and side are the bomb.  You should come try it. Less crowded than #1 and we think the food is better here as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food.  The atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Get the pollo fundido and a pitcher of margaritas! It's the best! The sampler with the fundido is also great to share"}
{"text":"Margaritas are the best anywhere!    Love the staff, love the service!  This is the first place we take out of town guests and they immediately feel right at home.  Always our #1 choice!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and this location tends to be hit and miss. The Cadillac margaritas are always consistent and the salsa. The food not so much. It was fairly good this visit...had tequila lime shrimp and both the shrimp and veggies were good; although the rice was on the dry side. Love the festive environment and patio!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time today because I am tired of the wait times at the original El Encanto in downtown Cave Creek - especially when the snow birds are in town. So I figured I'd rather be driving than twiddling my thumbs. I'm so glad I drove out to this one. Same excellent food, services, and prices. The inside and patio are HUGE and much nicer than one might think looking at it from the road. I wanted to watch a football game and was so pleased that they have booths in the bar area.  From now on, I am driving directly to this one first. One caveat: It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere and if you blink you might miss it. Use your Nav or GPS the 1st time."}
{"text":"Horrible food, great service but very disappointed in the food definitely not true authentic Mexican food. More Americanized then I'd like. Tried it for the second time perhaps it's what I ate the last time. I will not return to eat here."}
{"text":"Take out or sit down and be served...this joint is consistent in both service and quality. There is a 50% chance of your server being friendly. There is a 99% chance your server will be competent. Not once have they screwed up my special orders. They have know how and when to upsell. The food is fresh. The place is clean. They are not slow or shy to refill the chips and salsa. I even dig the other customers. It's just a laid back place to get your grub on. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went in last night everything was great, we always order the south of the border sampler which has a little bit of everything and plenty to take home...pollo fundido, tostadas, mini chimis, taquitos and beans...yum yum wish they had this at the other one on cave creek but they took it off the menu years ago and changed it up to things we don.t like....miss the turtles in the pond!!"}
{"text":"The place is very expansive with a great patio and garden area.  My boyfriend had been here several times in the past, and raved about their Pollo Fundido; however when he ordered his favorite dish it turned out to be the worst Fundido he'd ever received. The chicken was dry and there were only a few flakes of cheese on what was supposed to be an indulgent dish,  and to top it all off they got rid of the refried beans that used to come with the dish. I ordered the Pablano Relleno,  and although my dish was rather tasty with ample helpings of Carnitas and a wonderfully spicy green sauce... the rice that accompanied it was as dry as space food. Overall I'd say they need to step up their game on quality,  but I'd be willing to give them another shot."}
{"text":"I Love this place!  It's one of my favorites in the valley!  My kids love the ducks and I love the food.  The patio is beautiful on a fall day with the fun view of the duck pond and the shade from the giant trees.  One tree is built into the building."}
{"text":"Filthy dirty menus with food stains all over. Margarita is watered down and waitress said they made the batch in the morning. No tequila. What?  Unpleasant experience"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends promotion, house purchase and new business opening. While waiting for the third and fourth of our party a waiter walks a man up to our table and the man accuses me of \"stealing his reservation\" he's hostile and yelling and accusatory that I stole a reservation I made with my girlfriends.  The wait staff had the man confront me. Completely out of line and quite frankly not my issue.  Owner was polite and apologetic. With ample seating available not sure what happened or why. Have not been back and don't plan on it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what really makes this place. The waterfall out front, the cantina feel of the outside eating, the decorative tables and art on the walls all lends to the good feelings you get when you walk in.  The food is great as well. The mole sauce is one of the best I've had. You will not go wrong if you're looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Flavorless salsa, but maybe it is the head cold.  I had a bowl of Albongas soup which was actually pretty good.  Still prefer a bowl accompanied by flour tortillas, chopped onion and cilantro.  The taquitos were comparable to anything I could get in frozen section of grocery aisle.  The guacamole that topped taquitos was poor.  All in all not a great meal.  Service and decor were great though."}
{"text":"Ok, here it goes. Came here with my wife for her birthday. Upon arrival, looks great, pond out front is a nice touch. Outdoor seating in the right weather looks like it could be really nice. Inside, its fine.   Chips and salsa were delivered right away, and quite good to boot.   Wife ordered chicken fajitas and I ordered beef fajitas. When they arrived, everything seemed OK, although both seemed overly greasy, and after a few bites, it was very greasy. The beef and the chicken had zero seasoning on them, they were both very bland. The sides they give to build the fajita are ok, but no sour cream? Seemed odd to have to pay for a side of sour cream when we were paying $18 per plate of fajitas. The house-made guac was very average. One last note about the beef - it was cooked to well done which made it quite tough. The portions were quite large.   The service was good; offered informed suggestions and was prompt and polite.    Overall, the experience was fun with the wifey. But the $18 fajitas left much to be desired. Havent decided if we will give this place another try."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are good be ready to translate the menu with your phone if Spanish isn't your primary language though"}
{"text":"Sat in the patio area, very nice with the heaters. Started with bean dip, really good. Chips and 3 salsas were great. Cheese/ chicken enchiladas were really tasty. Tortilla soap was good. Service was a bit slow, more servers were needed."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding.  I've had several different entrees and liked them all.  I love the salsa trio to get my meal started as well.  The main issue here is the service.  Things tend to move slow and you often have to grab your servers attention.  If you can handle that consistent issue the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place multiple times and it is always packed.  We finally decided to give it a try, even with the mixed reviews.  We loved it!  We sat outside and the service was great. They give you three different salsa types to go with the chips and I thought they were all excellent.  There were four of us and we all agreed that the food was outstanding.  This is a place I would go back to and would recommend to others.  It also has a very cool bar area and would probably be a fun place in the evening.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  We finally had a chance to try this place.  45 minute wait for two people on a Friday at 6.  The food was pretty aweful. We started with grilled stuffed jalepenos.  The plate was covered in filler, but we could only find one jalepeno.  My Plato Mexicano must have sat on the warming tray a while because the plate was too hot to touch, but the beans and sauces all had a film on them.  The tamale was dry and way too thick while the taco was stale.  Just a big let down overall.  The service was ok once we got a table and the location looks like it would be a great place for a drink after the summer hear passes, but we probably won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! My food was cold and so were the chips. I have been here twice thinking that everybody has a bad day, but the second time was just as bad as the first."}
{"text":"I'm still stewing about the experience I had here last night. Bear with me on the length.... I'm THAT annoyed.  El Encanto has been a hit or miss for many years as far as the food. Boyfriend and I stopped in last month and were pleasantly surprised.... except for the service. Our server, a 30s something woman (whereas the others looked reasonably young), is just one of those people who should not be waiting tables, both from lack of customer skills and memory and just obviously not wanting to be there. We were too tired to get annoyed though.  We took my mom out for her birthday last night to El Encanto, and got the exact same server. Ugh.  Now, I've been waiting tables since I was 16, ranging from fine dining snobbery in Scottsdale to a Dennys to the Roadrunner Saloon where biker fights break out weekly. In NONE of those would her service have been acceptable.  1) Her style is awkward, rude and abrupt - she interrupted us mid-sentence multiple times, kept hovering over the table while we were eating, etc.  When I ordered a margarita, I had to repeat \"on the rocks with salt\" multiple times... what waitress can't remember a frickin' diet Coke, a margarita and a sangria?... and instead of asking me for my ID, she just stood there and stared at me (I rarely get carded, so it's not a habit to pull it out, and you still need to ASK, lady). I also mentioned it was my mom's birthday and she didn't wish her happy birthday, no candles on the dessert, nothing.  2) We somehow ended up being brought the pitcher of water and one water glass. What? There's three of us here, 2 of whom have alcohol... at least assume 2 glasses. We also had no silverware.  3) She VANISHED. Like, Harry Potter, Invisibility Cloak status vanished. Our drinks were brought by a manager, our food and silverware by a bus boy, the manager checked back on us, etc. We didn't interact with her again (except for her awkward hovering throughout dinner) until she came to whisk plates away and plop the check down....   4) You don't freaking drop the check without asking for dessert - what, are you nuts? Do you not want your check and tip to go up?! That's server 101. \"Hey, we want dessert.\" She brought a menu, not 20 seconds later swooped back to say \"Did we see a dessert we want?\"  and then I made my fatal mistake: I asked for another minute. This minute turned into literally 10 minutes (we clocked it!)  We finally order it, someone else plunks it down along with our check.  15. Dang. Minutes. After we're finished with our dessert. That's how long we waited, too hopefully, for her to come pick up the check. I was steaming to the point of wanting to dine n dash.   Finally I take it to the hostess stand and tell the manager I need to pay but our waitress has been.... She finishes my sentence with \"AWOL?\"   Gee, how did you know?  If you know she's been AWOL and is a terrible server, why is she still serving?  The manager merely ran my card, apologized with a robotic \"I'm sorry about that\", explained to me that one copy of the receipts was mine and the other theirs (who the hell doesn't know that?) and went back to the bar to talk to the bartender. No drink comps, no offer to make it right, nothing.  This is the first time I've ever totally stiffed a waitress, but it was the worst service any of us had ever gotten, and hey, you work for your tip. This is the first time I've ever had an issue in a restaurant and not at least gotten a sincere apology and an attempt to rectify it. To think I paid $67 for 3 people (without tip!) to get treated like we didn't matter, is ridiculous.  We will NOT be back, El Encanto, EVER."}
{"text":"I joined a large group at the El Encanto DOS on Friday, March 10th. We had reservations knowing that it would likely be very busy. Unfortunately there was a mix-up with our reservation on arrival but it was resolved quickly and cementing 4-star status.  Our table was outside on the large patio, which was perfect given the seasonal weather (daytime high 88). The chips and salsa were solid with three salsa selections. My preference would be to kick up the heat a bit on the third salsa selection. I kept my dinner order simple with chicken tacos. The tacos, refried beans, and rice were all satisfying. El Encanto is not a premier eatery but the ambiance and service make a return visit likely."}
{"text":"Weird that there are no reviews since last July on this place???  I have been here many times as it is 10 mins away from my house.  I do like the location because you feel you are right out in the desert and the outdoor sitting is nice.  Inside in the main dining section can be VERY noisy if it is busy.  Lots of families and kids too sometimes.  I just went on a Friday night and had a decent experience.  They have live music some nights, which is nice but can just add to the noise level.    The margaritas are very good.  Free salsa and chips are good.  Food can be a little hit or miss sometimes.  I usually get the Pollo Fundido and it has ranged from really good to okay on several occasions.  I think sometimes it is sitting under a heat lamp too long.  I did notice on this visit that the portion sizes have shrunk and the prices have remained the same, so I guess management finally have moved the way of many chain restaurants to squeeze more profits.  The food tends to be very salty.  Wait staff can be hit or miss too.  Friday night, the waitress was super busy and you could tell probably had too many tables but we got what we ordered in a fairly timely manner. Probably would give them 3.5 stars but that isn't an option on Yelp.  Will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I am not in love with Mexican food. I'll just start my review off with that. I mean, I'll eat it and I will enjoy it (usually), but I'd rather have a steak or a burger if you give me the choice. Ok, now that that's out of the way, I love this restaurant. We have been here several times in the two years we have lived here. The food is consistently good. I love the Pollo Fundido, which is like the best thing ever. You can refer to their website for the rest of their menu, with descriptions. Also, their burgers are better than a lot of American restaurants that I have been to! I don't know what they do differently, but the meat is so tender and perfectly cooked. My son and husband have gotten it before and I almost second guessed my Pollo Fundido decision, but I just took a bite of theirs first and everything was good. Okay, now, for the 21+crowd, their mango margaritas are the bomb. I mean like, you can set your straw in the middle of the cup and it won't tip over, it is so thick. The flavor is perfection, not too much sweet and not too much alcohol. The service is usually better when you go a little earlier in the evening, before it gets busy (and it will get busy), then the waiters usually seem to drown a little bit. Even with that, I can't think of an occasion where we've had BAD service, just less attentive once the crowd hits. So, if you are craving some delicious Mexican food & drinks, try this place out. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 celebrating a birthday! Everything went amazing. We had Venus as a waitress, she was one of the best waitress I have ever had. Drinks were great, food was amazing and service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the mountains and this is the closest restaurant to our house. GOOD THING! Because it's the new favorite restaurant of ours! We've been greeted by the staff every time we go in; The service was exceptional - We ordered the Pollo Fundido and the Steak Fajitas, which were both amazing! The server never let our iced tea get past half empty; The Manager - on most occasions - is moving between the bar tables & restaurant tables making sure everyone is happy. Speaking of Happy...Happy hour here is GREAT - even though we don't drink! The specials are good - and the atmosphere is FUN. If you have room - try the dessert - chocolate chimi's = OMG it was home made ice cream - this day it was a fresh French vanilla - with mini-chocolate filled chimis! Delicious! This is our new \"Cheers\" - like seeing friends every time!"}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've ever ordered off the menu especially the Pollo fun Dedo it is the best by far! Service is always great friendly and on top of things. Nothing to complain about not even the cleanliness!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by one of my neighbors as the \"go to \" mexican place to eat with my family, so i decided to give it a try.  The food was very tasty, I had the chicken burro. You get so much for the money which is a good thing in these economic times!  The premade magaritas will make you smack yo mama. Mango is my absolute favorite.  Give the other flavors a try, you may find your as well.   One flaw that I found was the dirty menus, but all in all, a good place to take a hot date if you enjoy a romantic atmosphere with desert landscaping out in the sticks....Peace"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful atmosphere. Looks fun. We got sat in a booth and I have an infant in a car set, in the locked down booths that don't move. We couldn't shift the car seat in the booth. So, the host brought us a high chair. The server comes barreling over telling us my daughter there was a safety hazard and my daughter couldn't be in a high chair at the end of the booth. She was in the way. She wanted us to put her in the booth, we couldn't and so we had to pack up and move. I felt unwelcomed and disrespected. As many restaurants I have worked at it has NEVER been an issue to have a car seat in a high chair by a booth. I wanted to leave and mom wanted to give it a chance. Food was bad and I felt comfortable with that entire trip there. Never ever again."}
{"text":"Frozen Margarita is awesome. Food is consistently good.  The specials are worth trying for sure!  Atmosphere is relaxed and an easy location for the neighborhood friends to gather.  Drive the UTV or horses up for a dinner is a great start to the weekend!"}
{"text":"So the second you pull up you know this place is fancy. It's pretty large and there are a lot of fixtures to greet you to know that you are not in just some random Mexican place. We sat outside on a warm February evening and had great service. It was great to have different types of salsa to dip the chips in. Reason why they get two stars is because the food was just very meh. I had a taco salad and considering most taco salads are pretty large, this one was pretty small even though it was over $10. Just iceberg lettuce that tasted pretty cheap, not a lot of beans, hardly any cheese, but good chunk of meat though. I was hoping for more balance but I didn't really get it. My dad got something a bit different but overall he said his didn't taste that flavorful. Honestly everything was just very Bland and it's unfortunate as this place could offer a lot. It might be geared towards the pallets of the area but for me, no bueno. Find another place if you're looking for not only more authentic flare, but more overall taste in general."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on their steak quesadilla with green chili sauce like a ten dollar hooker to crack. It's that good. I have dreams about it.  Damn good strawberry margaritas as well.  And like Daren writes, the pollo fundido is pretty amazing. Also recommend the pollo chimi with green chili sauce and sour cream. Or red chili sauce... Both are great.  Best Mexican I've found anywhere in the valley so far.  Bring your appetite because the portions are huge.  My only gripes are that the service at the inside bar almost always sucks and the cheapskate moron of an owner needs to fix the ridiculous urinal that's about 10' off the floor in the men's bathroom."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good.   Salsas were good.   Refried beans were really good.   Kids ate well.  So did the adults.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love their new menu items (new a year or so ago). I highly recommend their veggie enchiladas, even my chicken loving husband loves them. This place has improved quite a bit over the years.   Fast, friendly and helpful 5 star service. Good good and great drinks. Perfect chips and a variety of decent salsa. All right in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants and they do Mexican food right! High quality ingredients and terrific service make it a great place. Don't miss their flagship store in Cave Creek and be sure to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Mid grade Mexican joint. Not worth driving out to Carefree Highway for. The chicken fajitas were just okay. The chips were bland. The queso was...strange. The service was good and we got seated right next to the pond which offered a nice view."}
{"text":"We went there today for an early dinner. They gave us a nice seat in the dining room even though the bar and outside were the choices.      My wife had the veggie enchilada dinner and I the beef enchiladas. Both were delicious. Not the usual fair of most Mexican eateries. Mine was very flavorful and my wife agreed that hers was also.       Our waitress Wendy was very attentive and personable!        We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is our local joint and a favorite place to visit for a tasty meal.  The staff is friendly, and most of the time on the ball.  Be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night.  The big hit, the Pollo Fundito, best in the North Phoenix area.  Pork Carnitas are great to!  Margarita fan, well this is the place.  Get the frozen (they are more potent) and sit back on the patio.  They grow fresh veggies right there on location.   A staple restaurant for this family and worth the trip up to Desert Hills."}
{"text":"Went back with a friend of mine (not my choice) from out of town who LOVED Encanto when she lived here. I tried convincing her to go elsewhere because the place is so awful now. Well, our drinks were horrible to start off with. A piña colada that was riddled with ice chunks, no flavor, and half of the glass was filled with whipped cream. Ordering the pollo fundido, I got what I expected. A dry, flavorless chicken filling wrapped in a greasy tortilla. The fundido sauce WAS good, however it was cold, and just not worth the jacked up price they charge. Never. Ever. Again. Even if an out of town friend wants to go. I'll take my business down the road to Plaza Bonita instead."}
{"text":"The food is not \"super\" authentic Mexican. I normally get the Pollo Fundido. I like it, but the drawback is service is almost always slow there. Some of the food I find pricey for what you get. My husband and I ordered take out last month and he ordered a cup of soup, $7.00, and no joke, it was no bigger than a condiment cup. I was annoyed enough that I wanted to call the restaurant and he just said let it go-he was hungry and luckily had ordered enchiladas. Previous time we had gone in and my friend ordered the fajitas, waitress asked if she wanted all the \"normal\" things with it, my friend said sure. Well when the bill came, they charged her $1.95 for sour cream, $1.50 for cheese, $2.00 for guacamole and $1.50 for pico de gallo. So when the waiter came back and we pointed it out, she said \"well you said everything- so is this a problem?\" My friend wont go back since that. I dont blame her. I have had them inconsistent on pricing before when Ive ordered. Its nearby our house and the margaritas are good and my husband likes their soup, so thats why we continue."}
{"text":"Exceptionally popular and large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. I stopped in at a perfect time between rushes and received excellent service. I had shrimp tacos that were good. Unfortunately I mistakenly chose a jalapeño appetizer. With a half of a bite my mouth and throat were on fire. I had never tasted anything that hot."}
{"text":"Food was not worth the price at all. We waited 25 mins for our bill to come. Our waitress had 2 tables. We watched as the managers went to multiple tables to check in who had just been sat. No one can over to us at all. Not worth the drive to get here at all."}
{"text":"So we thought we'd give it another shot - either we're a glutton for punishment or we are forgiving kind of folks....    Happily, I can report that this meal was wonderful!  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  Jessica was our server and she was the BEST server we've had ever in the years we've been coming to this place.  The food was very fresh, tasty, hot and yummy.  The XX was cold and the service was perfection.  Yay El Encanto Dos for hiring qualified servers who actually want to be there!   Good on ya!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past 3 weeks.  The first time was for a huge girl scout leader award dinner.  We had our food catered and it was delicious.  They gave us more than enough food and the service was fine--nothing special.  I probably would have given it a 4-star rating.  But last week we came here for a happy hour/good bye party and it was awful!!! When I came in a little late, I went straight to the bar for my drink.  It's a good thing I did because the bartender was also our server and I later found out that he hadn't even served our table their drinks yet.  So I received my drink before everyone else who had been there a lot earlier than I had.  The bartender was extremely rude and unhappy.  He seemed flustered the entire time.  I'm not sure why we didn't have another server out there since there were about 20-30 of us.  The restaurant was pretty empty besides us.  This was a Thursday at about 5pm.  I went to the bar to order my food since all my friends were complaining about how slow he was with ordering from the table.  Luckily I think a manager came by and saw me waiting at the bar, so he took my order.  I ordered the street tacos from the happy hour menu.  Yuck.  I didn't care for them at all.  I just ate the carne asada off the taco.  My margarita was okay, but I had to repeatedly go to the bathroom to wash my hands because the syrup must have been all over the glass making my hands sticky.  The floor was also gross and sticky.  My shoes were sticking as I walked.  My biggest complaint however, was that they would not honor their happy hour prices for us.  Their reasoning was because we had such a big group.  I think that is ridiculous and unfair.  I plan a lot of happy hours for my work, and I will never plan one for here again.  They will be missing out on a lot of business.  Oh well....  It's too bad because I have heard that they have really good food.  I just don't think I'll be here again."}
{"text":"A favorite place in north Phoenix for Mexican food.  Friendly staff and it is not too loud, so you can carry on a conversation.  The Pollo Fundido is excellent."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this restaurant. At best mediocre quality food and service. They claim to have their own veggie garden but my salad reflect opposite. Not worth a special trip to try out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great staff great food can never give a five star to any one who has no wi fi.  All so my arms are sticking to the bar top."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was here because of low Yelp rating. It was on my path and my teenage son and his friend wanted to eat here. I'm glad we did. The food was delicious and full of flavor, very authentic. However, the service was slow. It wasn't crowded or busy either eating here around 2pm. Go for the food; not service."}
{"text":"This is a nice hidden restaurant in north Phoenix. It's culturally decorated with nice scenery for photos. The pricing is reasonable too. The menu is basic. It's good, don't get me wrong, but their items are so traditional They don't have anything new to try or something that makes them stand out. Overall, I'd go back."}
{"text":"We live very close to \"Dos\" so we know the manager, most of the wait staff, and just about every item on the  menu.   On the weekends, Maria is the best manager if you have any issues or want to pay a compliment - she is great.  Ask for Isla as a waitress if she's working - she's the best.  Just about everything on the menu is worth getting except the red tamales (substitute the green corn tamale and you won't be disappointed) and the fish tacos can be a little light on the fish.  If it's the chef's special night - go with the special... usually, it's really fantastic.  The chicken enchiladas mole is really good if you like mole. It's all good - including the desserts.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you want good mexican food in a laid back atmosphere - and if the weather is pristine, you'll want to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Tried \"Dos\" for the first time last night.  The original in Cave Creek has been a tradition for years in my family.      I was pleasantly surprised!  We sat on the patio which was beautiful and had a great view.  Service was fantastic and we ordered prickly pear margaritas and pollo fundido all around.  Food was fast and great.  Not one complaint from our party of six.  If you don't want to deal with tourists, El Encanto Dos is every bit as fantastic as the first restaurant.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the second visit for me.  Met some friends that live in the far north valley for some good food and conversation, unfortunately, only good conversation ensued.  We had a reserved table, so there was no waiting, despite the parking lot being packed - this place appears to be quite popular.  Both times I've been here on a Saturday night I've ended up parking in the back dirt lot.  Not a big deal, at least it's not valet parking.  Met our friends and ordered drinks.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks.  The drink was syrupy-sweet and there was no tequila taste whatsoever.  I dunno, maybe they got it mixed up with a virgin drink.  At any rate, I went with iced tea after that, which was fresh and tasty.  For dinner, I had the Pollo Fundido.  So many people seemed to like this, that it was a natural choice.  Too bad I did not share their appreciation for this dish.  The Jalapeno cream cheese \"sauce\" coating was dried on and hardly had any flavor, much like the dry-chicken filling which tasted like, well, dry chicken.  A little seasoning and spice would have gone a long way.  Service was great, our server, Chelsea, was spot-on, giving us our space to converse and being there with what we needed when we needed it.  Would I be back?  Only if I have to, definitely not for the food."}
