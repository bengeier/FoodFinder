{"text":"Tried this place only once, but then again...I don't live in Madison and just come to visit as often as possible :) The place opened up in April so they are still pretty new.    I asked if they had a restaurant too since most of the food stands do, but this is just food stand so if you like their food you'll have to get it there and then.  We shared the Tea braised pork and while it was pretty salty and left us satisfied again to definitely eat from this stand again.   The dish came with a pretty large portion of white rise, cucumbers/celery and an egg. Everything was good, but everything (besides rice/salad) was also a little bit on the salty side. Too much non-sodium free soy sauce I believe.   They also carry bubble tea, which I haven't tried."}
{"text":"I love food carts and was excited to see the large variety of food carts at the Library Mall when I visited town. The Tea Garden caught my eye because of their tea egg. Unfortunately, that was the only item that I would go back for. I ordered their BBQ Pork fried rice. It was very salty and have not much flavor other than soy sauce. Their bubble tea was just mediocre and their boba a little over cooked.   Their prices are definitely reasonable as you get a large bowl of rice for $5 but with so many other good food around, I will likely not go back."}
{"text":"Got the regular milk tea (cold) with pearls. Really mediocre. The tea tasted fine, but the tapioca pearls were clearly not boiled enough and were hard and tasteless. Gross. I'm sorry to say I definitely do not recommend, but that's also the only thing I've had here."}
