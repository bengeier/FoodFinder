{"text":"After abruptly canceling their Sunday wing special (to which the bartender admitted, he didn't even understand) they then gave us the saddest excuse for wings I've ever seen (see picture I posted). We had to REQUEST celery/carrot as a side...And to top it off they overcharged us on beer! Save yourself the trouble..."}
{"text":"I came in here expecting good things. Great beer selection, good tv availability, polite servers. Then we are nachos and pizza, it was the saltiest garbage ever. We were starving and left half the food on each plate. Come here to drink but not to eat."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, excellent selection of local craft beer. We were a party of two, and our waitress simply couldn't be bothered. She also mixed up our beers. Considering a single beer each was our entire order, that's a bit disappointing. I realize that we didn't represent tremendous tip potential, but really..."}
{"text":"Great food, beer and service.  The owners are locals that take pride in what they do and do it well! Service is phenomenal to boot- ask to sit in HB's section!"}
{"text":"I came here in the middle of summer. I understand that it's hot in the south in the summer, but good lord it was a furnace in this place. They had a great beer selection, and the food, on paper, looks good. However, my meal (the prime rib nachos) was nothing to write home about.    The service was less than average. It was near impossible trying to get the server back to the table.   I came here because I had a coupon, but I don't see myself returning to pay full price.   I believe they had only been open for a short while at the time of my visit, so maybe that was the problem."}
{"text":"Seriously? There was maybe 5 people in the place and it took 35 minutes for the server to ask our drinks. You can be in the weeds that's fine, but honestly, the menu changed the severs are really slow. Get it together team. It's amazing that you are even able to pay the high south end rent, because you really suck."}
{"text":"At bras tape Had the pube burnger really good! Jalapano cram chase! Also drink d9 experience! Mondays night cornhole torments, Tuedays has 2$ tankos and 4$ margatas # drink local yes go to then bras tamp! Wow went to banthrom and they threw aw way my pube bhrger and then made another when I came bake! How nice bartenders are very nice will go back!"}
{"text":"Great selection in beer, but the wait service was really bad.  Came in for brunch on a Saturday and took 20 min for us to get drinks after sitting down.  Food came out and the Panini was soaking wet on the bottom and the home fries were dry.  To end this lovely experience, took the waitress 10 minutes to bring back our check.  Anyone in their right minds wanting to eat there would be crazy.  Go for the beer selection and skip the food....you'll live to thank me."}
{"text":"Not the best service or food I've had. Many more options around southend that are much better. Service was absolutely horrible. I never got a refill on water and was there for about 2 hours. The waitress took a while to bring our drinks. Ordered a burger and it tasted like a frozen bubba burger. I had 3 bites and couldn't stomach the rest. Ordered a side salad and the only options for dressing were ranch and blue cheese??? Really, no oil and vinegar in the kitchen. That's concerning. Asked for ranch and never got it.  Last time I'll be going there for food or drinks."}
{"text":"Great addition to South End! Came for the 70 taps that feature a lot of local beers, but the food was phenomenal. Had a large group and sampled a lot of food. I highly recommend the Peri Peri wings, prime rib nachos, sliders, and pub burger. I don't normally order burgers at a restaurant, but the sliders and pub burger were extremely tasty. Lots of TVs and a great patio with plenty of fans. Opened by a couple local guys, and we were happy to support them. If you like good beer and good food, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"First the good, great even:  -The buffalo wings are excellent. Even a better deal with they are only .50 each! I love that they come with carrots instead of the usual celery.  -The pretzels with beer cheese sauce are also fantastic. I'd come back just to have a beer and pretzels. A little pricey though at around $8.00.  -The beer selection is awesome.   Now for the not-so-good.  -The salads are awful. Literally looks and tastes like ice berg lettuce with kraft singles on top. I couldn't eat more than one bite it was so gross. For $7, it was a major disappointment. Maybe I shouldn't have expected a good salad from a bar. After complaining about the salad, it was still left on the tab. -We ordered a flight of 4 beers. First we were told it was $8, then waitress came back and said it was $10. No worries. But when the check came it was actually $12! The beers were good, but the surprise bill was annoying.  -Weird rap music was playing in the background. Didn't really seem to fit the sports bar atmosphere.   We'd come back just to watch a game and grab a beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"A good new addition to the Southend neighborhood. Good spot to hang out with friends, watch a game. Servers are super friendly and knowledgeable about the draft selection. Their brunch menu is super cool. I had Guinness Bacon Waffle and they were awesome! Definitely, this is going to be our hang out spot now on."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is delicious, the beer has endless options and the daily specials make me want to go everyday! Dog friendly, lots of games and televisions for entertainment! The wait staff is soooooooo friendly they treat me like a best friend! Dave the owner rocks!!"}
{"text":"Great burger, great outdoor seating. Big beer menu. A friend recommended this place for dinner and it was good. Would come back. Bacon cheese tots were really good!"}
{"text":"Allyson and brass taps tots are the tits. Great food and atmosphere. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible TERRIBLE service. I went with a large group and it took us an hour to receive waters and another hour to get our food. The server complained to us that there were only two servers for the entire restaurant and that they were slammed, with no real apology. We asked if we could get an app or something to make up for the two hours that we sat there waiting and hungry and they responded with blank stares. The food wasn't even anything special. There are so many better options within a short distance that it's really not worth your time. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Loved brass tap!!! Had an amazing time showing my friends around Charlotte and starting out here! Our bartender Allyson was amazing!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The wings are some of our favorites in Charlotte! They are crispy and always hot. My favorite sauce is the garlic parmesan. They also have a fun trivia on Wednesday night!"}
{"text":"Really 2.5 - great beer selection, good enough food, but consistently terrible patio service. My advice: just order inside at the bar if you're going to sit outdoors."}
{"text":"And the award for worst trivia goes to.......... BRASS TAP.    Your trivia is terrible, which is the understatement of the year. Groundhog day themed trivia....???? Who did you think would find that fun or cool????    Your food is mediocre.    The end   Ps. Whoever does your trivia needs to be fired and sent work in a salt mine"}
{"text":"First time here and last.  They only serve brunch on Saturdays until 2:00 pm. Asked for a fried egg on top of the hash and they said they could not do that.  Who can't make a fried egg?  Very disappointing and will not be back. Also, loud loud music."}
{"text":"Mediocre bar food. Nothing I have ordered was bad, but nothing to rave about. Great patio, good for sports. The cleanliness is under par. It is clear they haven't cleaned the women's restroom in several weeks as the toilets are dirty and have pink and black rings around them which is disgusting for a bar. I can only imagine how often you must clean your bathroom at a bar, and it's obvious they don't. Not saying I wouldn't return, but for a new bar in an upcoming area, don't expect much."}
{"text":"The staff is horrible. Had a friend Anonymously send 2 girls a drink and the bartender told them they were on him. Ask for house vodka and was charged for grey goose! Will never go back."}
{"text":"First time here.  Pleasant surprise.  Awesome outside eating area and the inside has a ton of nooks to gather with friends.  TVs for the sports fanatics and giant jenga outside.    With just about 75 beers on tap,  you are sure to find a poison you will love.  I tried the Oskar Blues Gubna and at a whopping 10% is rather light and refreshing WHAT! Trust me,  great stuff. We also decided to order the fried buffalo chicken wrap and jalapeño corn fritters. Delicious   Also tried the Hi Wire Man Eater. Surprised that it has a jalapeño or habanero or some kind of pepper taste. Interesting flavor when not expected.    Great place to unwind.  They have been open for bout a year. So if you have been here early on,  come back.  They have made positive changes.  Jay and Zack were perfect and answered all our questions and provided great company during our visit.    Must try!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I have gone a couple times already, and 1) every time the servers are very slow. 2) They don't know the specials and then fight with you when they get it wrong. 3) Also, I took about an hour for 1 burger to come out when tables around us were served food faster. 4) No one knows where the bottles are located as it tool 15 min for a bottle order when there were 2 tables occupied. OVERALL, 10% TIP OR LESS."}
{"text":"We have walked by this place several times and always talked about stopping in. It was after a few beers, at Wooden Robot, that we finally decided to mosey on over to check them out.   When we walked in, the bar had several seats open, so we decided to take a seat at the bar. Most of the time, sitting at the bar ensures that you will get quick service. Not here. We waited nearly 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us and hand us a beer list. Ten minutes later he came to ask what we needed. Why did he take so long to come over? Because he was busy talking with a woman at the other end of the bar. It was not busy. He was just socializing.   I will say that the beer list was extensive and the beer we had was good. That is why I gave 2 stars. I don't know that we will ever be back. I suppose I should have given the bad reviews more consideration before stopping in. There are plenty of other places with good beer and good service. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer garden & pub food! We had a large party & the servers helped us find a table on the patio. It's first come first serve for tables but as we had 7 people they gave us advice. We are dinner and had beers that were a wide variety. I had Belgium draft beers and the chicken panini/goat cheese with the Peri peri sauce on the side since its spicy. The chicken was moist and tasty and I liked the bread. Servers were helpful and very good to our party!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out one night. Server was super nice and helpful, they have tons of local taps. We got a couple appetizers and the peri peri sauce is pretty good. It's hard to describe but it's spicy. The Margherita pizza was great and so was the Mexican chicken flatbread. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish yelp had halves so I could give a 2.5 but unfortunately the BrassTap left me extremely underwhelmed. We were excited to check the place out and grab a drink and the beer list didn't disappoint - a lot of options you don't see too often so that's a plus.  However, holy heck that food, eh. We were surprised about the decent prices but it made sense after we got our meals. One of our meals was the 4 Meat Pretzel Pizza and she said personal sized but we honestly thought we were in a Chuck E. Cheese with how child size and doughy and mediocre it was. We also got a \"Large Tempura\" Shrimp meal and it was just a small plate of a dozen small fried shrimp and about 6 fries. We considered another plate but after the first two and looking around, we decided against it. Then after getting the bill it took about 15 minutes to get the waitress again to pay and go. So the meal and paying portion of the experience didn't pan out well.   There a bunch of tvs and the patio is a nice touch but the decor felt a little too dark and dungeony for a place trying to give off a laid back vibe.   All in all, we give second chances so we'll probably go back to try other meal options and hopefully it'll be better but if not, I wish this wasn't so but it's just not a place I see frequenting too often."}
{"text":"I was walking around town this weekend and decided to pop in to give this place a try.  A bunch of people were in there to watch the Masters but not overly crowded.  Sat at the bar and grabbed a menu from the person next to me.  I sat there for close to 10 minutes and was never even greeted.  The bartender kept walking right past me.  When he waited on a group next to me, that came in after me, I just got up and left.  I was telling a friend about the experience and she informed me that they are known for bad service.  Doubt I will be going back.  Wooden Robot is next door and has much better service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming here. I left a bad review on their Facebook page and now their employees are harassing me and calling me a liar. If you want terrible service and frozen food this is the place for you, but if your service sucks and you make a complaint about it they'll go bat shit crazy on you. Fair warning."}
{"text":"Their assortment of local taps is great and their food was very good. I just wish the space was a little larger as quarters got quite right as the night crawled on."}
{"text":"Do you remember elementary school cafeteria food?  Microwaved, soggy, smells like wet dog.  This place is essentially like that.  But, with the added ability to get drunk!!!  That's why I gave it two stars.  Consume alcohol here, just don't eat."}
{"text":"Visiting town for race weekend and decided to tour some breweries in South End. I wanted to watch the xfinity race so this looked like a great bar to do this at while drinking local beers. First of all, there was only 1 bartender to serve too many people. I know this is the fault of the ownership and not the bartender but I've never left a bar so angry. The bar had 12 TVs from what I could see where I was sitting at the bar and 6 of them had women's softball on. This is Charlotte race weekend and not one TV had the xfinity race on. How do you not have the Charlotte Motor Speedway race on in a bar IN CHARLOTTE?! I asked the bartender to change one of the TVs to it and she basically gave me a \"f*** you\". I chugged my beer, paid, and left. The beer cost $6.50 and I paid with a $10. All I got back was $3 so she gave herself a 50 cent tip without my consent. Pretty sure this is illegal. I wanted to watch the race so I didn't have time to contest so I ran out of there to the All American Pub(highly recommended). DO NOT GO TO THIS BAR IF YOU WANT EVEN AN IOTA OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. I've never had a bar piss me off so badly . Please do not give this place business. They don't deserve a time (which is obvious by the way they stole money from me ). ANGRY!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night.... Service is horrible. Been here over 20 minutes and still no drink or food. WTF?"}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour and it's a pretty solid spot!   The setup is easy- you seat yourself and the specials are listed on the board. We were there early and the place wasn't packed at all. There's tons of beer taps  behind the bar and if you have questions...just ask! They are happy to bring you over some samples!   I can't remember the beer that I got- but the waiter explained it as an \"upgraded\" version of a blue moon. Whatever it was it was really good! I rarely stray from my local favs but this was worth it!   Tuesday is $2 tacos! For. The. Win.   I ordered a pork, beef and chicken. They were all pretty good and definitely hit the spot. We also ordered some pretzel bites with beer cheese and jalapeño beer cheese. My fav was the jalapeño but both were good choices.    A-ok in my book. I'd come back again to grab some drinks and apps."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook! Great food, awesome beer list, super duper Staff! Outdoor seating available. Their beer list is huge! Definitely something for everyone. I had something old school/ sweetwater blue plus a lemon drop shot! The ribeye nachos and the angus steak tacos were out of this world! The staff was very attentive and really charming!  Dom was so friendly and welcoming! Prices are reasonable and parking is okay if you get there before dark- there are also pay for parking spots all around."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a concert at Amos'.  Not nearly as crowded as I expected.  They have a ton of beer taps, and seem to be making very good use of the selection.  Many NC beers here.  Had Stout from Unknown Brewing (Take the Kremlin) and wings. I missed out on the $4 beer special, but I wanted a stout. For the wings, I went with Spicy Garlic and Dry Rub.  Next time I'm going with all dry rub, they are just less messy to eat.  Service was quick, food and drinks were top notch \"bar\" fare."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. I came over here when it was Dharma lounge and I love the changes they have made. The service is the worst I've ever seen though. I was here for over a hour and was told a server was coming, but not a single one came by. We ended up continuing to order drinks from the bar because it seemed like the server was purposely trying to avoid our table. I probably will not be coming back unless I feel like waiting forever for a beer."}
{"text":"I checked out Brass Tap a few times now since they opened and love the place. The tap list is second to none and they have always had something new to try...the beer menu is literally printed on a daily basis to keep up with the rotating taps. The atmosphere is great as a place to meet up with friends and hangout for hours. Many reviews complain about the service but I haven't had any issues and have been happy with my experience.  I will put Brass Tap at the top of my list."}
{"text":"A great brewpub in SouthEnd, in a great spot.  The decor is spot on, and the patio is a nice size.  They've got a ton of beer on tap, and a pretty impressive menu for the size of the place.   I've been through twice now, and sat at the bar both times.  Bar service was quick and friendly, and prices were pretty good.    Sunday brunch menu is limited, but very good - the waffle with blueberry syrup was delicious, and the western breakfast pizza was clever, and great to share.  I also tried the pretzel pepperoni pizza off of the regular menu, which was a great one to share, too."}
{"text":"I don't make a point of writing bad reviews but I can't remember when I have had service this bad before.  We took a table outside right after it was cleaned off.  We were there at least 20 minutes before anyone ever came to our table.  There was no \"sorry for the delay\" she just left the menus and walked away.  Our servers name was Allisha, it took her 30 minutes from the time we sat down to bring us are first round of beers.  We eventually got our food, which even as she dropped that off did little more than leave the food.  There wasn't even a \"enjoy your food\".  We never saw her again to even try to order another beer.  We finally got our bill and then she took off again.   As I was vented about how bad the service was one of my friends pointed out that \"we don't know, maybe she's having a bad night\", But I've served tables before and even on a bad night I'm still polite to my tables.  Allisha comes back out to the patio, which I'm sure she'll come get our tabs and cash us out, instead she goes to another table, takes time to go through the menu with them, is full of smiles and nice and chatty... (not typical of someone having a bad night), then instead of grabbing our tabs, she heads back inside.   I've been here once before, have never dealt with this server and throughout the ordeal we were nothing but patient.  There was no excuse for the crappy service we received.  Even when she finally dropped off our checks/change she didn't say a word.  Is it so hard to say \"thanks for coming in\"?    The idea of never knowing what other people are going through goes two ways.  In our case, my wife and I were given a rare chance to go out without our kids and we chose to hit Brass Tap.  So our one night was pretty crappy thanks to the crappy service.    I will say, the food I had was good, but the service made me want to never return."}
{"text":"A very fun place; nice addition to south end. Great beer selection and they have really good drink and food specials throughout the week.   will be back"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few friends.  The waiter/bartender came over and let us know they were out of all flatbread pizzas, which was no big deal. He then brought over waters for all of us and I tried to order a specialty drink which was on the menu. He then told me that they didn't have the liquor for the drink I ordered,so I tried to order another one.  He said they didn't have the liquor for any of the drinks on the menu, so I ordered a beer.  We then ordered, my friend ordered the fish and chips. After we ordered he came back and told us they were out of fish. I ordered the French dip. When it came out I realized there was no cheese on it. He said it came like that. It was the worst French dip I ever had. So basically the whole experience was terrible. I've been there a few times and it has been pretty good. After this experience I will never eat there again, but may go for a drink... Hopefully they will  have liquor!"}
{"text":"Our service was pretty good but everything else was not. We sat outside and 2/4 heaters were broken. They had 1/2 price appetizers and wine which was exciting. I ordered Cabernet which was fine and the loaded tots which were terrible. They tasted as though the grease hadn't been changed in months and so I couldn't taste any of the toppings because the burnt old grease overpowered. It also claimed they had bacon on them but in reality it was just 1 giant piece. My friend got the sliders and they were pretty lame coming with only cheese on top. It was trivia night which was fun but it took so long and there was such a long amount of time between rounds. They also had 2 of the questions wrong, which is a bit picky but when you're going to play trivia you're assuming they have the right answers."}
{"text":"First time at the Brass Tap. It's a pretty big bar and the staff is friendly. I love how they have a variety a drinks other than beer for us non beer drinkers. I had the brass mule. I love Moscow Mules and this one was decent. I will be back to try the other cocktails."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Their staff is very moody, they have power trips and rude to us and other patrons. I will never go back here again and I suggest you don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Oh, I had mixed emotions walking into what used to be Dharma Lounge to check out The Brass Tap.  Did I need to show my ID to the bouncer and pay a cover charge?  They left the stand at the front to use it for the host stand which made it feel even more like I had to do that.  Anyway, this place is part of a chain based out of Tampa which I did not realize before perusing the site.  However, I had to give them a shot because of the wide selection of beer.  They also have liquor, mixed drinks, and some wine.  I had an Ass Clown pumpkin IPA which was not good at all, but not the Brass Tap's fault.  They also had half off of shareables (appetizers) until 7 so I I ordered a beef quesadilla.  It was a decent size but it was typical.  They have different specials every day so you may want to check their site or social media to see what they have.  The bartender was pretty nice too and we conversed a little bit about the old Dharma Lounge.  I would return here.  It is not a huge place, but it does have a patio and would be a good place to go after work because they have something for everyone.  It basically reminds me of a smaller Duckworth's but with much more of a corporate feel to it."}
{"text":"Had the quinoa bowl with friends. You can tell it's instant quinoa and a lot of lettuce. We got the mixed app as well, egg rolls were good, shrimp were good, portions small. Beer was ok, sangria specials were a nice add for the night. Just kind of an average place to get food"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and they have always been extremely busy, which has related to slow service. Overall, it's a great bar. They have a ton of beers on draught, select wines and a pretty good drink menu. Most of their cocktails are $5-$7 which is a bonus in my book! Plus they always seem to have specials.   The food isn't bad either. I came here for lunch and got the chicken wrap, which was ok. Nothing spectacular. I've also had their wings. They were the winner for me! I'll definitely be back for those. Plus the wings were only 50cents! I wish I knew when they run their wings specials so I can return ( it doesn't say online. I went on a Sunday after a panthers game).   Overall I would return to Brass Tap because it's a fun, convenient bar by me but I wouldn't expect 5 star service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Brass Tap but there are a lot of areas they need to improve on. Went there over the weekend and was sitting at a table and it took 20 minutes for the waitress to get us our order of beers. Then it took 45 minutes for us to get our food, unacceptable. The food was very uninspired and was your run of the mill bar food. They really need to get their kitchen and bar service together if you can't keep it together on a Friday/Saturday night you will never survive. Thankfully the manager comped our food which was very nice of him. May give them one more shot because they do have a great selection of beer but the food and service is lacking."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Trivia is amazing on Wednesday nights.  Carly is an amazing bartender,  I really only like Miller lite or budlight and she introduced me to other different pilsners that were like Miller.  She had a lot of knowledge of the beer and what would taste good.  Also my friend and I ordered the famous pretzels with beer cheese and seriously the pretzels tasted like they were from a cart in Philly if you know what I mean.  We had the prime rib nachos and the meat had great flavor and was cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, chill place.  The fish tacos are amazing and they have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas on Tuesdays. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the service is a little slow, but I'd still go back."}
{"text":"They appear to have A LOT of beers on tap and also by the bottle. Not a huge beer fan but ended up here with some friends who were hitting up a bunch of breweries nearby in Southend. They also have a decent liquor and wine selection. Outside, covered patio with heaters. They have several TVs outside and inside. The outdoor patio made for a nice setting to enjoying a few of the games and relax under the comfort of the heaters. The menu looks to have a variety of options. Giving them a 5star based on environment, service and drink selection. Didn't try any items off the food menu - I will have to come back for that."}
{"text":"Allyson did a fantastic job taking care of us! It as our first time here and she made us feel right at home. They have an awesome beer selection and the food is ok point. Would definitely recommend stopping in for a fun time!"}
{"text":"That service was s.......l.........o.........w.......  Ugh!  Beer flight was ok. Can't blame the bar for one of the worst beers I've had, but their waiter.  Wow. 7 tables on patio and it took at least 5 min before he saw me and went for a menu.  They must bury them in a basement closet because it was another 3 min before he returned. Promised napkins and silverware when dinner brought out.  Never delivered. Beer flight was gone thru half the meal and never offered another. Finished meal and say for another 5-8 min before he acknowledged me. Got the bill and left. Good was o.k.  Nothing to write about."}
{"text":"The fella and I visited on a Wednesday since it was half-off wine night, and it turns out it was also trivia night (starts at 7:00). Parking was a little tricky when we got there at 4:45, and based on how crowded it was when we left, I'm guessing it got downright hairy!  The inside is really cool - dark wood for coziness but high ceiling skylights for openness and light. The bar is long with a bajillion taps (mostly local - NoDa, Sugar Creek, Sycamore, Unknown, D9, etc.), and there's a covered patio, too. We sat inside and got friendly, consistent service. I had a couple of glasses of wine, and the fella got a few draft beers. Their bottle list was interesting, but some of the prices were insane... stick with the tap list!  We split a combo appetizer ($13.99), which came with pork pot stickers, eggrolls, and tempura shrimp, and tempura chicken tenders ($5.99), which we had seen come out to other people and looked delicious. Everything was really good. I don't usually have high standards for \"bar food,\" but it wasn't greasy or heavy, and the dipping sauces were pretty delicious, especially the sweet chili sauce."}
{"text":"Right near my place so I'm a little biased but the food is stellar, only complaint is that the portions are on the smaller side. Staff has talent and uniform yoga pants but they can be a little on the slower. I'll give it a break since its new. Overall great experience and a nice place to have a meal and begin a day of serious drinking. 4 stars awarded."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and appetizers, located right in the middle of the buzz!"}
{"text":"Service is awful...went in Sunday around 6.30 and it wasn't too crowded.   Hostess said we could sit wherever, so we sat right next to the door outside.  We proceeded to sit for 10 minutes while wait staff went by and were never checked on or given menus.  Finally my wife went inside and asked a manager for a server, which we got 5 minutes later.  The beer out of the tap was leukwarm.  We sat with empty beers for another 5 minutes and finally gave up.  We actually had to go inside to request to pay.  We live a block away and are unlikely to go back based on other reviews in yelp with the same experience.  There are too many options around south end for this place to last once the newness novelty wears off without very drastic improvements."}
{"text":"great beer selection.  they have tons of great local selection and national selections.  food is above average bar food.  service had been great the 3 times I've stopped in"}
{"text":"Literally looked up happy hour specials and found some at brass tap! Walked in on a Friday around 5:30 and place was dead. Handful of people in there...tried asking bar tender about current specials, she just wasn't friendly. So I literally just said thank you and walked out. No thanks. Went to wooden robot instead, it's right next door."}
{"text":"Place was half empty on a Saturday night so we thought we'd get good service..10 of us sat down at a table in the bar area. Took 27 mins to get our drinks. Meanwhile there was no one sitting at the bar. The drinks were poured and left at the pick up place for 10 mins. The 2 bartenders spent the whole time flirting with each other, when asked if they could bring our drinks to us because our waitress must be on a cigerett break, they just gave is a dirty look.   Ghetto rap music with cuss words every other line. We asked if they could change the music, response was, \"This is our Saturday music\".  How's that working out for ya? place was empty.  Crap service with really bad attitudes towards customers. Went to Wooden Robot and had a blast, spent $600 between us. Big loss for this place."}
{"text":"What's going on here? There are only 2 waiters working and 1 bartender (no food runners either). Of course the service is awful! The poor staff is miserable. We only had pretzels, super super greasy and the cheese... No. Just say no!   Sad to say I won't be back. To quote Mr. F, \"that was a letdown.\""}
{"text":"Sweet! So the choices are as follows:  1) Go visit the brewery 2) Let the Brass Tap do all the footwork for you  70 Taps! Are you kidding?! No, apparently they aren't...  Just opened and the place was packed to capacity!  NODA, Ass Clown, D9, Unknown, Sugar Creek, Sycamore and OMB all in one place! Skip the brew tour bus and just sit at the bar!!!  Super cool and friendly staff will hook you up pronto! Great bar food, outdoor space and atmosphere!! Wonderful addition to South End!!"}
{"text":"Another solid addition to SouthEnd.  I was here on a really slow Monday and had a few beers during lunch.  The selection was pretty large but might could use a bit more diversity and maybe some specialty taps.  Could very well be that I caught them during a time they just simply didn't have any.  The interior is cozy and the bar is nice and long, inviting you to come sit right as you step into the dining area.  The parking is street side only I believe, but I do recall a parking lot down the street that you can likely utilize if needed."}
{"text":"The food was decent. The service was some of the worst I have experienced in years. It wasn't our server's fault. He was working his butt off but was one of the only wait staff in a crowded restaurant. Then our order came out wrong. This place is doing themselves a disservice by under-staffing their restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for upscale bar and the beer selection is great. Why 2 stars? I have heard complaining of bartenders, seen staff pow-wows, and some dude just randomly yelling \"Harry Potter\". This place is more staff playground than beerhaus. Pretty awful on the service side. Actually, we were served appropriately...I just wish there were a manager somewhere keeping these folks under control. Very unprofessional and just sloppy. First and last visit."}
{"text":"What a Great addition to south end...! I've been here about 5 or 6 times now and this place just keeps getting better and better. Yes, first couple of times service was a bit slow and drinks took a little long to come out, but in their defense I was here on the 2nd and 3rd night that they were open.  The following time I came in was for the USWNT game vs Germany. I called ahead and the manager was nice enough to reserve a table for me since I was coming with a big group. They were slammed that night! People everywhere -- even with all the craziness going on service was solid and we all got our food within a reasonable amount of time.   I have now tried 9 or 10 things on their menu and I have not eating anything that hasn't been good! The pizzas and flat breads are all very tasty - the burgers are excellent - and their Peri Peri wings are fantastic (ask for them well done, trust me!  Along with all the tasty food they have a shit tone of beers on tap, tons of tv's, games, and a great outdoor patio. I can't wait for football season so I can make this one of my go to spots to catch some games.   Come check this place out - it won't dissapoint!"}
{"text":"I went to Brass Tap with girlfriends for a drink and appetizer. We ordered from the extensive beer menu and some waters since we came from yoga. We sat waiting a good while for our beers and we were never served water until asking a couple more times.   I am a big fan of buffalo chicken dip. Of course our group ordered it to snack on since we were starving and things seemed to be moving pretty slow. The dip was nothing to brag about but what got me were the stale chips. I wouldn't order it again.   I ended up not even ordering anything to eat. The server wasn't helpful and we felt that we were an inconvenience.   Overall I was pretty disappointed. The staff working that night seemed as though they didn't want to be there and it brought the energy of the entire place down. This place has a lot of potential. I may give it a try in the future again."}
{"text":"Great addition to South End. Great selection, great vibe and enjoyable staff. If you want to avoid the craziness of All American Pub on game days, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Don't advertise your place on Uber Eats if you'll never accept an order! Very disappointing to wait 15 minutes only to have the order rejected by your place. I won't waste my time again."}
{"text":"I went last night with 4 friends for the trivia night. It's probably the worst service I've ever gotten from a waitress. It took 15 minutes to get acknowledged, 40 to get our bottle of red wine, an hour for a salad, and then 45 for our tab once we asked for it. But she was attentive to all the tables around us that were filled with men. It could have been a fun night but was very frustrating. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Was awful. Came in on a day off, came in and sat down with my mom who is visiting. Then another guy came in. We both got menus after 5 mins of just sitting there. Then was told I had to give my info to be a member. Don't care, not a big deal. But I work as a bartender. Honestly, don't know how the guys behind the bar keep a job. They didn't ask me what I would like to drink. Even though I was just sitting there and the other guy that came in after us already got served. I had to ask the guy can I order a beer? Got a beer that tasted flat. I don't know what it's like on a busy night, but if that guy can't handle 2 people at a bar  anyways won't go back. Wooden robot is right next door and you get way better beer and service."}
{"text":"Awful service, terrible food, rude customers need I go On? They are constantly out of food and accused me of having complaints about me a week later.  Just after a girl slammed the door in my face but she was dressed up And I was in work out clothes...Get your crap together and accuse the right people of their mistakes.  I've been nothing but a good customer there and literally have never had anyone working there mention to me that there was any issue.  As a matter of fact Sumir and another server have been super kind and always speak to us.  The issue is the workers, food and rude customers.  How dare you accuse people of issues a week later.  If I was a problem, address it THEN JERKS.  Maybe it was the lady who told me to take the wine glass to go.  She probably lied.  Will never be back. AND YOU CERTAINLY DONT WRONGFULLY ACCUSE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF A CROWDED RESTAURANT AND HUMILIATE THEM. AND THE NON APOLOGY I RECEIVED FROM TGE IDIOT MANAGER ON THE PHONE WAS RIDICULOUS.  Don't hang up on customers who you owe an apology to and don't tell me that you would t care if you were humiliated as a female alone being attacked by two grown men.  You deserve a lawsuit."}
{"text":"At first glance, the brass tap was a great place. Great ambience, a lot of people but not too crowded to the point where we couldn't sit, not too loud for a Friday night, and had a great selection of beer. We ordered drinks after about 10 minutes. I ordered a wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer after a few very grumpy bartenders pretended to care about his questions concerning the beer menu. They did give him samples of a few beers which was nice, but not happily. He finally found the beer he wanted and it definitely was good-a raspberry wheat beer (can't remember the name).  After about 15-20 minutes we finished our drinks and had to wait another 15 minutes for anyone to ask if we wanted another or if we wanted to cash out. We kept trying to get our bartenders attention but they seemed to blow right past us. We finally did get someone's attention and paid, still feeling that we were a burden on the bartender.  We did not eat here but I would be willing to go back and try the food and service again. The menu was pretty big and offered a variety for low prices considering its south end and things tend to be pricier."}
{"text":"We use to be regulars at Brass Taps because they used to have quality bar food, which is surprisingly hard to find in Charlotte. We hadn't been in a while and went in last weekend only to find their menu had changed completely. They no longer had the beloved flavored waffle fries we craved. We ordered regular fries (which had bits of burnt food from the dirty fryer) and wings. The wings were breaded and sat in a THICK layer of orange grease. We saw other odd items, such as a bruschetta served in a giant martini glass (why?!?) and tater tots in a skillet (again why?!)   Covering up gross, low quality food with whimsical (and weird) presentations isn't going to work.   Totally disappointed and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I like it, they have a large selection of beers on tap and the chicken tacos are always on point!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and specials. Corn fritters are a game day treat, the flat breads are yum! Not your ordinary bar food place that's for sure."}
{"text":"The staff here are very nice, food is amazing. If you are looking for somewhere to grab a drink with a good variety and all around delicious menu check this place out! I've tried numerous things on the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"... I had a generous 1 1/2 inch foam head on my stout/-- and got pissy when I asked for a proper pour ( nor did they fix it) not returning yet he did greet quick and serve fast  ... Plus never saw my server after after order again - fail"}
{"text":"I went here with some girlfriends to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago! It was half-price wine Wednesdays and we got a few bottles for the table.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the laid-back ambiance over some appetizers and good company!  I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love walking into south end to stop by here for a drink. Their martinis are my favorite!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came for CLT Burger Week for the $5 Cowboy burger, which my boyfriend and I split and it was delicious. We also ordered the quinoa salad (with chicken) and it was such a pleasant surprise! I would go back just for that quinoa salad. The menu is eclectic and looked great. The service was amazing - we sat at the bar and our server was new, but did a phenomenal job with his service. The trivia was fun, too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is your average bar food and I found the drinks to be rather over priced. The chicken tenders were fine but nothing to write home about. I wish this place was a bit more unique and offered more to the area than another standard bar."}
{"text":"Okay so today, 7/11/15 was my first time at the Brass Tap and I just walked out! I am beyond disappointed by the service in addition to the management! I live less than a mile and will never return! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I came in a couple of days in a row and had great food every day.  The beer selection is as good and varied as anyone's in town.  Samir was very helpful and I enjoyed our discussion and tastings of some different sours and saisons.  This is not super convenient for me but I will definitely go back again for the good food, good service and good beer selection.  It's a large space and has a great covered patio area.  Solid selection for lunch and I bet it's fairly lively for after-work meet ups as well."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Patio is awesome and they always take care of my dog.  Friendly staff and great food.  We live right around the corner and are frequent customers"}
{"text":"We had the best experience at Brass Tap during our most recent visit. Bartender Jah was fantastic. He asked us what kind of beer we like and gave us a sample of a beer he thought we should try. He was spot on with his recommendation. As a result, I found a great new summer beer to enjoy. He was extremely knowledgable about the crafts on tap. The food was pretty good as well. Great service, great spot in the South End! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not the best but definitely not the worst. We had a table on the patio to watch the UNC game and had a hard time getting our servers attention if we needed anything. I got a Margherita pretzel crust pizza. They are personal pizzas that even though the pretzel crust sounds weird it's just normal crust. The pizza is a little soggy but the crust is good. It is a bar so you shouldn't expect the best pizza of your life. Overall this has a nice atmosphere and is a fun place to watch your favorite sporting event. My suggestion is if you want to drink a lot get up and go to the bar to order your drink because like i said you'll only see your waiter once every hour. Another tip is that they have a mimosa pitcher that is $10, it is solid and a good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Good spot to come with friends or co-workers for apps and drinks after work or to watch a game. There is a ton of seating at the bar as it's about the length of the restaurant. There are lots of tables for any size group.  They have a great beer list. And good food specials throughout the week.  The tator tots are homemade and are outstanding. Every time I eat here, they are going to be my go to side."}
{"text":"Sat down waited 30 minutes to be served ordered and an hour later I got this sorry excuse for a meal. Cold, hard, over cooked and I'm not paying for it"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. It would be a 4-5 star place if the service wasn't awful. They move at a snail's pace. Seriously. I've never experienced something so slow.  You can ask them over and over for another beer, but it may come 30 minutes later. It wasn't even that busy when I've been there."}
{"text":"I've been to Brass tap for panthers games and had a great time. They have a great beer and wine list and tons of tvs. Dining, however, was a whole different experience.  I am currrently on a gluten free diet, and have never had an issue eating anywhere in charlotte. When I asked if they had a GF menu, they did not, ok fine. The eye opening DISGUSTING part is when i asked if they could check certain items were gf.  For example, I asked if the chilli was gluten free (since most homeade chilli's are). To my surprise, they said it comes out of a bag from a distributer and they do not know the contents of the ingredients! When i asked about a few other items, the server admitted that NOTHING is made in house. This was proven with my husbands clearly formerly frozen patty and formerly frozen waffle fries.  I went with the hummus and asked if i could have additional produce to dip in it. All they had were celery which was FROZEN and precut cucumbers for salad. THey could not even slice up fresh cucumbers.  Charlotte is an area that has so many fresh, local, handmade restaurants that why would anyone go to an establishment for disgusting food.   We were so disappointed and will never return back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I sing Brass Monkey to myself the entire walk from my car to the door. And also sometimes in the bathroom. RIP MCA.   I don't see how you can't like this place. Beer. Bottles and drafts. A ton of it. All of it. Changing taps with the seasons and what not. I mean, I got an adult root beer float. Do I really need to say anything else? That's right, Not Your Father's RB on draft the last two times I've been here. Warning: drink your float quickly or it will overflow. Don't like beer? They have cocktails and wine as well.   Our good friend Billy M wanted two things for his birthday: dinner and great beer. So, we came here on a Thursday night. Nailed it. Our server was fantastic. We had people coming in and out joining us. He never skipped a beat. Seriously, if this guy isn't employee of the month then he's getting robbed. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Note: the mac n cheese has bacon and green onions on top. Oh, and it's freaking delicious that way. Billy got a pizza with pretzel crust. Oh yes, pretzel crust. Our table also did pretzel bites, spin dip, bacon cheeseburger flatbread, an All American burger, and the buffalo chicken wrap. Another side item note: they have waffle fries. Everyone really liked their food. I devoured my entire sandwich, poor thing didn't stand a chance.   There's a good amount of TVs for all your sporting needs. The patio is a pretty good size and they use heaters when it's cold. A ton of great specials throughout the week, including happy hour food specials. Two dollar tacos on Tuesdays. Boo-freaking-yah. Spoiler alert: they are really good. My favorite is the fist because I love peppadew peppers. You can get a couple tacos and a margarita for less than $10. Tuesdays are also game night, trivia on Wednesdays.   Until next time Brass Tap, Brass Monkey, that funky Monkey. Brass Monkey junkie. That funky Monkey...."}
{"text":"I came by the Brass Tap after tailgating for the Panthers Game yesterday.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was busy but the service was very speedy, our server was a young African American male, and he couldn't have done a better job, and he was so polite!  There were a lot of people but not too many where we could talk among our table.  The beer selection was extremely wide! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Friday & loved the large selection of beer! Great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience. We went in with another couple and got a variety of things on the menu. Everyone agreed that everything we got was just okay. Not terrible, but not good either. What we got: Wings- the best thing we had All American burger Meat lovers pretzel pizza BLT chicken wrap French dip- this is what I got and it was not good at all.   Service was great. The server we had was very friendly and personable. It was also extremely hot inside. I think this is due to the patio door opening and closing. Something to keep in mind on a hot day. Unfortunately I don't think we will be going back. (Sad part is I live a block away, and wanted to be able to go back)"}
{"text":"Don't write many reviews but felt the need on this one.  As some have said, service was not real good, especially for a Sunday football night.  The kicker, raw Chicken wings.  Yes, red, raw chicken wings.  May not eat wings for a while after this one.  Just hope I don't get sick tonight."}
{"text":"This place. This place. I loved this place, as in it was our place to stop for a \"snack\" and good beer. Now, it's the \"oh we wish this place was good\". The menu has changed and the food isn't good anymore, plus the service has become sub-par...and it's not the waitstaff's fault. They are ALWAYS understaffed.    Came back again....honestly hoped the last time we were here was a fluke, but it was not. Went to order a flatbread, and they were out...as in out of all flatbreads. A staple menu item, and they had none. Then tried to order a different appetizer item. Out. If it was busy, I might understand it, maybe, but as an established chain, I don't understand how you run out of multiple food items or an entire section of your menu.   I think the only reason this place stays in business is because it's in South End and the area is so inundated with people."}
{"text":"Met some friends here last night for a few beers. To get the bar tenders attention was nearly impossible. They seemed more concerned about getting every glass into the dishwasher then serving beer (and making money). They failed to ask when they took our empties away if we wanted another one, and we had to wait 10-15mins before we were able to get their attention again, even while seated/ standing at the bar! They could have easily gotten 2 more drinks out of each of us (4 total in group) if they were a bit more aware of their surroundings."}
{"text":"They serve brunch, but don't serve coffee. They have biscuits, but no jelly. I ordered the sausage hash and everything tasted like it came out of a bag. The sausage crumbles were over-fried and tasteless, the potatoes had a rubbery texture, and the biscuit was chewy around the edges, a clear sign that it was frozen and then reheated.   On our way out, we saw a couple with only water in front of them who were waving their hands in frustration. They got up and left almost immediately after. The place was nearly empty at the time. Given the plethora of great brunch options around Charlotte, this place should be low on your priority list, if at all."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. Both times the service has been really slow, but the food is good.  It's a really nice restaurant and a great location"}
{"text":"I went here with one of my friends on a recent girls night because neither of us had been here and wanted to try it. We sat on the covered patio and started with drinks. The beer menu was extensive and had a lot of options. I had a raspberry beer of some sort and my friend had a cherry tart cider. We both liked our drinks. Appetizers were 1/2 off when we got there so we ordered the combo, which had potstickers, southwest egg rolls, and tempura shrimps. We really liked it and it was perfect for two people sharing.   Several reviewers have complained about the service but we had a great experience. Our server, Ja, was helpful, friendly, and checked in with us often to see how we were doing, refill our drinks, etc.   For the meal, I ordered the buffalo wrap. Now, if you've read my other reviews, you know I love wraps and buffalo wraps are my favorite. This did not disappoint! I really liked the the wrap was grilled and the tortilla was crispy. There was a lot of chicken and the buffalo sauces was tasty. I ordered a side of the waffle fries and there were overcooked but still okay. That would be the only thing that could've made this meal better. My friend got a burger and waffle fries and she really enjoyed here. We both agreed that this a place we would come back to."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, decent food, good happy hour specials. I had the chicken sandwich, which was plain and small but not bad. Had the side of cole slaw, which is good if you like jalapeños. Service is decent, as long as it's not too busy. Some of their bartenders are not beer aficionados and aren't careful with their pours. But it has a calm, pleasant atmosphere with quiet alt-music soundtrack."}
{"text":"I've been in twice and really enjoyed myself both times...  It was a little smaller than I expected, but there's good seat placement, so you don't feel like you're tripping over people or anything...   The service was absolutely fabulous the first time and relatively decent the second, so I'm giving them a solid star for that...  I know the main draw to a place like this is the brass taps, but I've actually enjoyed both of my food items more than the drinks I've had...  I thought the Biermosa was good, but the Guinness Bacon Waffles were delicious... And don't get me started on that sausage gravy... Good grief, that was yummy...  The next time, I can't even remember the beer that I ordered, but it was some type of Pilsner... The Florentine panini was out of sight, though... It was kind of like having spinach artichoke dip on a sandwich... And their home fries are the diced potatoes kind...  Both times, they were piping hot and had the perfect crisp on the outside...   It might be a little pricey, but the amount of food kind of makes up for it in my book... I was stuffed after the waffles and could only finish one side of my sandwich, so I was very happy.    I'll definitely be back to tap that."}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was good. Service was atrocious and they were not that busy. This place would easily have gotten 4 stars if the service wasn't so bad. It wasn't just our server it was all of them. Borderline almost gave one star. The restaurant easily missed out on 3 drinks from me which equals to $4 in extra tip for her."}
{"text":"While trying to find a place to watch the Final Four games we came across this place and loved it. The seating was seat yourself, we got lucky and managed to get two tables and bring them together(we had quite a few people). It was busy. But cleared out after the first game, picked back up before the second. The food was good. I tried the fried onion appetizer. Can't remember the name but the description made me think of a blooming onion from outback. This one was a little different Bc the onion was more in clumps. Not quite onion rings, but not in a circular shape either. They had a nice tangy sauce with a little heat that came with them. Other people ordered wings and burgers and all enjoyed their food. The brass tap has a great draft beer selection and also a good bottle selection as well. Tvs pretty much along all the walls so you can see the games very well. Good spot! I will def return!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I know this is a bar and people come here to drink and have a good time, but there are still limits. We arrived Sat 9/26 around 6 pm to celebrate my sisters birthday. We tried to sit out on the patio but there was a group of 12 or so behind us talking and cursing loudly and screaming at the top of their lungs at the tv to the point we could not even carry on a conversation with each other so we moved inside. Most people don't know how to act in public any more any way and it gets even worse once they get some alcohol in them and that there are other patrons around them that may not care for that type of behavior or language. Inside was a little better but the noise level really didn't come down till around 7pm when the college football games came to an end.  The Appetizer: Warm soft salted pretzel pieces with warm beer cheese. Very good  The Beer: They advertise over 300 beers and we tried quite a few that night, but by the same token, they were out of over half a dozen or more we wanted to try.  Food: Typical pub grub that was good. I got their version of fish and chips and my sister let me try her ribeye sandwich on ciabatta bread. Both were very good.  Service: I don't understand the bad reviews for service. Even thought it was busy, our server, Molly was on top of her game, answering our questions about the beers and making recommendations. She took our food order and brought the meals promptly. She kept the beers coming and quickly cleared away empty glasses and plates and checked on us often.  Over all we had a decent time. Food and service were good but it was way to loud and profane to the point doubt I will ever go back. I didn't enjoy trying to eat with it so loud you could not even hear the person next to you and the constant barrage of profanity. Unless you like it uber loud, including a lot and I do mean a lot of profanity, I would suggest not going on Saturdays during college football games. I suspect Sunday during NFL football would be just as bad."}
{"text":"Bartender spelled wrong on the board  Didn't give us a drink menu No wings or pretzels on game day?! What are the specials? - no idea  Can I have a pub burger with mushrooms or Swiss? - we don't have Swiss or mushrooms  Can we have a tv that matches the loud audio on? Especially on game day? Uh?  2 stars is nice. Without the extensive beer selection they would've gotten 1 star. Can't believe this place is still here. I came on opening night over a year ago and had to talk to the manager about slow service. Nothing has changed. #getonsouthendslevel"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here a lot. The garlic parmesan waffle fries are fabulous, and they're one of the few places in Charlotte with a decent selection of dark beers. You know, everyone has a ton of IPAs, but we're stout/porter drinkers, and I've found a couple that I really like from trying there. We did have one incident where the service kind of sucked, but the manager immediately made it right, and I have a lot of respect for that. The only thing I really don't like about the place is the parking."}
{"text":"Checked out this place during Wooden Robot's soft opening for a quick lunch before a long day of libations (Whatever, I had a Friday off, don't judge). Their beer list is awesome! Definitely some things that I hadn't had, or heard of before. I won't review those here, because that's what Untapp'd is for.   The pros of this place: The food is really high quality and unique pub fare. The beer list is pretty awesome, the star of this massive tap wall is local brews, which is great to see.   The cons: As Tom Petty said, the waiting is the hardest part. The first two beers we ordered took about 5-7 minutes to come out. It didn't seem like the floor staff (as opposed to behind-the-bar) was allowed to go and pull the tap handles. Come on :/  We started out ordering a small side order of their pepper jack Mac 'n Cheese, because we were waiting for a few more friends to join. This order of a small dish took about 18 minutes to come out. It was great Mac 'n Cheese, but not 18 minutes great. Our main dishes were probably the most timely out of all things we ordered, coming out at about 15-20 minutes. That was acceptable. The rest wasn't.  We visited during a very very slow lunch hour, and I don't understand what took so long with a majority of our waiting. I hope this place picks up; I'll definitely be back, and I don't want to drop the rating. I want this place to get the 4-5 stars that it has the potential to get!"}
{"text":"I have never given places reviews but this place is so horrible I signed up to do so. So I will give a little detail of our experience and why we will never be back. We went in at 10:30 saturday night and sat down, about 10:40 someone comes up to take order, we ask if they had a late night menu and were told no they do no we can only get drinks. Bummer but whatever we were okay with having a drink then leaving to pick up a bite to eat on the way home. No big deal. As Im on the phone calling in an order someone brings us a menu and says we have 10 minutes to order. Great! So I hang up and dont order anything to pick up now since were staying. We order on the spot and then server comes back to say I cant have anything with tortillas so no wrap. Oh well no big deal at this point Im fine with chips and dip. Few minutes go by and the server comes back and says Im sorry its chips they wont so (yes used the word wont...so now Im getting a little irritated, but I get over it) so back to the wrap thats fine. Meanwhile another employee comes up to rush the server and say can you hurry up and give me their order so I can put it in. Ummmm HI were sitting right here thats so disrespectful to us AND the server...So were about half way finished with our drink and then at about a few min pass 1120 he comes back and apologizes that they wont make anything now. Oh so youre telling me you wasted 45 minutes of our time when we didnt even complain when you initially said your kitchen was closed, we were going to go somewhere else and come back a different time! Probably the worse customer service experience I have ever had. We felt so bad for our server because the kitchen staff or whoever they were came out by the table to cuss and complain to him right in front of us. Sorry that our presence was such an inconvenience to your staff that they felt the need to waste 45 min of our time and humiliate one of your servers in the process. We will not be back and I will make sure to tell anyone I know to avoid this place so they dont get the same experience that we did.   Maybe post kitchen hours so there is less confusion. And maybe dont give your customers food menus if you dont want to make then chips and dip.    So to anyone thinking about going to this place, dont.  There are plenty of breweries and eateries around that have great beer selections and wont make you feel like your business is an inconvenience."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but the staff makes it so hard. I work in the service industry, so I know how bad it stinks to receive an unwarranted bad review about seemingly good customer service, but some of the females here have been some of the rudest individuals I have ever encountered at a bar/restaurant. One even went so far as to scream at us because their friend was unhappy with a member of our group? Where's the professionalism!   However, the 1 star is being given solely for the great beer selection and decent food. Outdoor patio is nice as well. I guess my one recommendation would be to just teach the staff a lesson or two on professionalism, and to maybe not say EVERYTHING that comes to mind. Some of the staff is GREAT though, I do want to make that distinction.   I'll probably return, as long as we aren't kicked out at 12 again when the posted hours clearly state 2am. We get it, you don't enjoy a slow night, GET USED TO IT! That's the industry."}
{"text":"Ohhh Brass Tap, I want it to be so much more sometimes! I will say it usually has a very solid beer line up that has something for everyone. And they often have beer reps in for special nights that involve some good beer swag.  The food sounds way better than how it comes out so I would say stick to some of their basic apps that can't go to wrong with like pretzel bites.  If you are not familiar with the area there is very little off street parking which continues to get tighter as new complexes go up.  The service is usually pretty good and it is one of the few places in the area that has a good amount of TV's to catch a game.  It is a bit loud and has the younger SouthEnd crowd and there is not a ton of tables unless the weather is warm enough to sit on the porch which is heated."}
{"text":"Pretzels are BANGING!!!! And the beer cheese is amazing! I love their food. My brother and I really came for drinks! He got the Marco Gras Bock and I had a glass of Chardonnay. ( I know, weird coming to a beer bar and drinking wine, lol) It's a little busy for the 1 bartender on a Saturday but she does an amazing job in spite of being busy! Awesome music selection!"}
{"text":"Happy hour review only.   We walked in around 5 yesterday and found brass tap with only a couple of other patrons. It didn't stay that way though, by 545-6 it was packed. We're were also lucky to find $2 tacos (beef, chicken and beer battered fish) as a taco Tuesday special, the tacos were ok, the beer battered fish was meet crunchy and flavorful. Since it was half off shareables, we decided find something of the menu as well. Keep in mind, this is only valid for the appetizer portion of the menu and does not include pretzels, flat breads, or sliders. They really need to include that in HH as well, technically these are all small plates to share too.   We ended up ordering the Rosemary and herb waffle fries and a 10 piece wing order (garlic parm and peri peri sauce). Food took a while to come out but the service was good. I wasn't a fan of the Rosemary \"powder\" on the waffle fries. It was too dry and I expected actually herbs to coat my potatoes. The wings were so good! Fried to perfection and tossed with a generous amount of sauce. The peri peri was surprisingly spicy, loved it, and the garlic parm was so creamy.   Everything came out to $18 ( I also got a house margarita, was good too, slightly strong). Be careful, the wings never get docked 50% off on the first bill, they have to manually input it in. I would have paid full price for wings if I didn't check before I handed my card over.  I will def have to come back for the wings, they were awesome.the lettuce wraps looked good too!"}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. I would recommend coming here on a game day as they have a lot of tvs and incredible beer selections.  The one issue I have with the bar is the seating/hostess situation. You walk in a find your own seat. It sometimes takes a while to get a waiter to come to your table."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they opened and find myself coming back! The bar is owned by two local guys and let me tell you, they are amazing. They're walking around introducing themselves and checking to make sure everything is good and great. Now for someone that can be overwhelmed by too many choices this place sounded like it would be anxiety ridden for me. Fortunately the bartenders and servers are great. They let you taste beers you're uncertain about and they make great recommendations. There are 70 beers on tap! Not only do they have craft beer, but they make excellent cocktails and have wine!   I went for the soft opening and tried a few different items off their menu that they were passing around, everyone was great! They were nice and helpful. I was back again on opening day and it was packed for a Monday. I tried the buffalo chicken dip and the caprese flat bread. Let me tell you, those were excellent choices. The buffalo chicken dip wasn't too spicy or overwhelming. It was great! The flat bread was a good choice too. The next time I came for food I tried the Cowboy burger and it was good, I got the Cowboy sauce on the side, but I think next time I'll have it on the burger.   The Brass Tap is has a lot to offer, from different types of beer, cocktails, and assorted food on the menu; you're bound to find something for everyone. The atmosphere is nice and inviting. The tables are first come first serve, but they do have a nice patio with bar games like giant jenga and connect four. If there is a sporting event, make sure to come early so you can grab a table or a spot at the bar!   Make sure to try this place out in SouthEnd, it's conveniently located next to a brand new brewery as well!"}
{"text":"Bar: I've been here a few times for late night drinks and have always been a fan. Good beer selection. Laid back atmosphere. And GAMES!! Cards Against Humanity, Trouble, Scattegories, Pictionary, Mad Gab. Some are missing a few pieces, but with some improvising, they're all just fine.   Food: Pretzels with cheese are very good. $2 tacos on Tuesday's are surprisingly good as well. Chicken, beef or fish. Came in around 7pm and had no issue finding a seat at the bar. Tacos took longer to come out then expected. I assumed everything was pre made up, but they tasted fresh so I will take the trade off. However, the Caprese flatbread was pretty underwhelming. I ordered it after a few beers and still didn't want to finish it. That's saying something.   Service: When seated at a table it has always been good. Bartender during taco Tuesday was not very friendly or attentive.   Want to come back to check out trivia on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals/service I've experienced in Charlotte in a long, long time. After coming back from a Charlotte football game, my girlfriends and I tried this place since we had heard good things. I wish I had checked out my trusty yelp before stepping in the door. It was a cold night and the bar was pretty packed. Luckily, we found a table by the window and squeezed in. The temperature inside was almost as cold. Our waitress wasn't mean, she was just bad. Clearly, they were understaffed. We literary had to wave her down anytime we needed anything. She didn't come to check our beer or water once during our hour and half visit. We left with all empty glasses and only received silverware after flagging down a bus boy.The bus boy brought out all our food and he was the most polite and helpful out of the entire staff- Thank you for being the only good part of this place. Our Margaritas weren't bad, but the chicken tacos were underwhelming. Some random pieces of chicken thrown atop of shredded melted cheese and hot sauce. I ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI, this was absolutely horrible. I thought about sending it back but was afraid I wouldn't  get a second order of anything since our waitress played a disappearing act. My sandwich was all bread with two little pieces of shredded chicken (not grilled) ,I was eating a hummus sandwich, a bad one at that. I'm really not one to give a lot of bad reviews, but as I'm writing this, i'm just reminded of how bad this place is. We ordered an app, drinks and 6 meals and all of us left disappointed. I would stick to beer when you visit the Brass Tap or just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So many brass taps!  Glad this place is open and a nice addition to the SouthEnd \"places to hang out.\"    Right off of Summit, there are places to park for 1440 S Tryon building or a short walk from the Bland Street Lynx Station - just be careful crossing Tryon at the weird intersection where it splits into Camden, but there are proper crosswalks and just be patient with the lights at the intersection.  Car vs. walker is never a good situation for the walker.  Walk in... no hostess table, sit where you like.... lots of places at the bar and someone is taking your order.  This place has a ton of beers on draft and a large bottle selection...  if you can't find something to drink here there is probably something wrong with ya.  Pretty extensive menu for eats as well.  Lots of \"shareables\" or appetizers/bar food.  This place is a chain (from Florida?) but its not a bad thing.  I like what I've experienced so far.  It feels like a stand alone place and a great addition to the Charlotte scene."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Brass Tap. It wasn't really crowded when I arrived...but as long as it took for the drinks to arrive, i almost thought that it was a full house and I just couldn't see it.   My spinach dip was really good but that also took 40 minutes to arrive. Not sure what happened here but I'm not sure I will be running back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place felt like a poor carbon copy of several other bars. The draft selection at Duckworth's is far better and the atmosphere at Brass hovered between a dive bar and chain bar without really committing to either. Also, the service at the bar was... grumpy. Don't know if he was having a bad day, but he put a hell of a damper on our day buzz beer crawl. We only lasted one beer there before moving to the next spot.  This place is right next to Wooden Robot which is why we tried it. Proximity not quality was the deciding factor. Next time we'll walk a little farther."}
